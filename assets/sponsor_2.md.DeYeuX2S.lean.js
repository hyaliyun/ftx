A plant pathogen, it grows on the leaves of the spring beauty flowering plants Claytonia caroliniana and C. virginica.  Taxonomy  The species was first described scientifically in 1874 by Charles Horton Peck, although Peck attributed authorship to George William Clinton, mayor of Buffalo, New York in 1842–43; the first specimens were collected in Buffalo. The specific epithet was originally published as mariae-wilsoni, but this is an orthographic error that was later corrected to mariae-wilsoniae. Early 20th-century rust authority Joseph Charles Arthur considered Uromyces claytoniae to be synonymous with P. mariae-wilsoniae, but this conclusion was rejected in a later publication, and the putative synonymy is recognized by neither of the taxonomic databases Index Fungorum nor MycoBank. The epithet honors Mary L. Wilson, a Buffalo-area botanist who frequently collected specimens for Peck. The fungus is commonly known as the \\"spring beauty rust\\".  Description  The rust grows on all sides of the plant, producing scattered clusters of reddish-brown sori on the surface. The aecia (specialized reproductive structures) are cup-shaped and have a conspicuous peridium. The spores produced by the aecia (aeciospores) are hyaline (translucent), covered with minute warts, and measure 18–27 by 14–20 μm. The telia are about 0.1–1.0 mm in diameter, and dark brown; teliospores measure 33–56 by 16.5–27 μm with brownish walls 1.5–2.5 μm thick, and are two- celled with little to no constriction at the septum. The surface of the teliospores are ornamented with rounded warts that are 0.2–0.5 μm high, separated by 1.4–3.0 μm between the centers of the warts. The variety Puccinia mariae-wilsoniae var. montiae differs from the main form in having teliospores measuring 27–46 by 20–28.5 μm, and walls 1.6–3.0 μm thick, and warts 0.9–1.7 μm high.  Habitat and distribution  The rust grows on the leaves and stems of plants in the Portulacaceae family, including the Carolina spring beauty (Claytonia caroliniana), the Virginia spring beauty or fairy spud (C. virginica), and the lanceleaf springbeauty (Claytonia lanceolata). Other host species include Montia fontana and M. sibirica. It is known only from North America, where it is common in the United States and Canada. The variety montiae has been collected in Washington, California, and Utah; its hosts are Montia sibirica and M. cordifolia.

Investigation The local district police believe that the fire was caused by a short circuit, but the railway officials would not rule out possible sabotage. Some passengers reportedly heard an explosion before the flames broke out, while the speed of the fire's spreading and the reported discovery of a kerosene can, has raised further suspicion.

One of the area's leading early farmhouses, it is the latest in a series of hotels on the same spot, and it has been designated a historic site. The portion of Preble County around West Alexandria was first settled between 1800 and 1810, and the village itself was platted in 1818 and incorporated eighteen years later. Just two years after the village was laid out, local resident Valentine Mikesell was granted a hotelier's license for the property where the Lange Hotel stands. Its location was fortuitous for a hotel: the Lange sits at the village's central intersection, along the old road to Dayton to the east. As the years passed, West Alexandria prospered; sawmills and gristmills were established within its limits, and before long it was a commercial center for the surrounding agricultural countryside. A larger lodging facility, the Eagle Hotel, occupied the present site by the 1880s, but it was demolished for the construction of the present building in 1887.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1178. West Alexandria's hilltop site near Twin Creek and its location along a major road made it the junction of multiple important transportation arteries.

Accessed 2012-07-30. Despite the new construction, there was soon a lack of space, so a two-story wing was constructed on the western side of the original building in 1904. Today, the hotel remains on a busy street — Dayton Street is now U.S. Route 35DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 64. . — but by the early 1990s, it had ceased to be a hotel and was vacant. Nevertheless, it retained its structural integrity; in January 1991, the hotel was declared historically significant enough and sufficiently well preserved to warrant addition to the National Register of Historic Places, a designation that it officially received on 25 January. Essential to its status as a historic site was its rôle in the community's history as a transportation center.

Intended as a follow-up to two earlier Morricone compilations assembled by Dagored, the album was put together by Alan Bishop and released by Ipecac Recordings. Crime and Dissonance features work ranging from the later 1960s to the early 1980s, and contains scores taken from films of several different genres. The collection focuses on Morricone's lesser- known soundtrack work, with Ipecac founder Mike Patton consciously wishing to distance it from similar compilations. Released on October 18, 2005, Crime and Dissonance has been met with favorable reviews by critics. The album has attracted comments on Morricone's experimental and innovative compositional style, often in contrast to the spare-sounding westerns he is known for. Production Crime and Dissonance, a collection of Ennio Morricone's film scores from the 1970s, was conceived as a follow-up to Dagored releases Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001. However, that label abandoned the project, and Mike Patton of Ipecac Recordings decided to release it instead. Morricone had no input in the project; instead the track listing was assembled by Alan Bishop. Bishop had previously assembled the Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 collections as well. All three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period, spanning the late 1960s to the early 1980s, but concentrating primarily on the early 1970s. Bishop had been given a list of films whose scores were available to use in the collection; he set about compiling the two-disc set from there. However, the final song on the album, an eleven- minute section from the soundtrack to Un uomo da rispettare, was not included in the list of available material. The project was delayed for some time while Bishop waited for record label Sugar Music to license the song. Patton, founder of Ipecac Recordings, has described his admiration for Morricone's writing, feeling that the composer turned \\"what could be banal, surface-style pop into really deep, orchestrated, tense and compelling music\\". Patton considers Morricone to be one of his favorite composers, and wanted the compilation to serve as a fitting tribute. He felt it was \\"imperative\\" for Crime and Dissonance to focus on Morricone's lesser-known work, as it had to compete with a large back catalogue of similar compilations. To this end, Patton and Bishop focused on Morricone's more experimental work, which Patton has compared to the music of Brazilian tropicália group Os Mutantes. Patton has praised Bishop's work on the project, calling him \\"a big Morricone scholar\\", and has described Crime and Dissonance as one the Ipecac releases he is most proud of. Crime and Dissonance features liner notes written by composer John Zorn, who had previously reinterpreted Morricone's work on the album The Big Gundown. The album's title reflects the range of genres covered by the films whose scores have been included, with the collection gathering music from \\"horror, suspense, mafia, and period movies\\", including several pieces taken from Dario Argento's giallo film L'uccello dalle piume di cristallo. However, the album itself only lists the titles of the films, omitting the context in which the music was originally presented and leaving the compositions to \\"speak for themselves\\". Track listing Reception Crime and Dissonance was released on October 18, 2005, through the Ipecac Recordings label, although it has previously been scheduled for release on September 6 of the same year. The album has garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. Writing for Allrovi, Thom Jurek rated the collection four-and-a- half stars out of five, calling it \\"essential Morricone\\". Jurek felt that the album served to present \\"a much wider view of Morricone not only as a composer, but as a sonic experimentalist\\". Pitchfork Media's Joe Tangari awarded the album a score of eight out of ten, describing it as \\"a minor revelation\\". Tangari felt that the collection represented Morricone's most innovative period of work, and praised Bishop's compilation for its cohesion and flow. Joshua Klein of The Washington Post has described the album as featuring \\"bizarre soundscapes, discordant drones, proto-sampledelica, weird instruments, strange sounds and oddball voices\\". Klein felt that the collection portrayed Morricone as a ground-breaking and confident composer, eschewing his trademark spare-sounding scores to freely experiment. The A.V. Club Andy Battaglia rated the compilation an A−, noting its dissimilarity to Morricone's more well-known work. Battaglia complimented the arrangement of the tracks, feeling that they flowed into one another well, and noted the range of genres the collection represented. Danny Fasold of The Roanoke Times has commented on the wide variety of styles the collection contains, adding that it proves \\"Morricone always delivered something interesting\\". Stylus Magazine Cameron Macdonald rated the album an A−, finding that the \\"kitsch\\" mass-market appeal of Morricone's better-known western scores made Crime and Dissonance a more \\"relevant\\" record. However, Macdonald felt that album's second disc was the weaker of the two, finding that the \\"slapstick\\" nature of some of its pieces seemed out of place. Dave Gurney of Tiny Mix Tapes rated Crime and Dissonance three-and-a-half out of five, calling it \\"a group of Morricone's most uncompromising works\\". However, Gurney questioned the target audience of the collection, believing that it would not be likely to appeal to casual listeners while not presenting much new material for dedicated Morricone collectors. An anonymous review for The Stranger described the album as proof that \\"there's much more to the maestro than his revered spaghetti- western work for Sergio Leone\\". The review highlighted the range of genres present in the collection, calling the end result a \\"deluge of otherworldly, endlessly fascinating sounds\\".

It is considered Lowndes County's most famous relic and is decaying, becoming a dangerous site, due to its abandonment. For decades, it has served as the center of urban legends and small town curiosity in the nearby cities of Quitman and Valdosta. The bridge has developed a reputation for being a popular \\"hangout\\" for teenagers and is rumored to be haunted due to its isolated and overgrown environment. History According to Charles Arnold, electrical superintendent for Quitman, the bridge was built circa 1920; however, its actual date of completion is unknown. The land near the bridge was owned by the Walter Cunningham family, and a resort called Blue Springs was located across the bridge near a train stop on the Brooks County side. Blue Springs resort attracted tourists from around the state of Georgia and included Blue Hole, a natural spring located near the bridge, and cabins for the tourists to stay in. According to Larry Cunningham, nephew of the late land owner Walter Cunningham, in the mid-1940s a gas truck crashed into the bridge's railing on the Brooks County side, tearing between 50 and 100 feet of railing. The railing was never repaired. According to Cunningham, at least two drownings occurred at Blue Hole prior to 1970. In the late 1940s, a flood washed out and eventually destroyed the road on either side of the bridge, making the road unsafe for vehicle traffic. A new bridge in conjunction with US 84 opened in 1950, dramatically reducing the amount of traffic on the bridge, and around 1970, Blue Hole dried up, bringing the local tourism to a halt. According to Cunningham, satanic graffiti, such as pentagrams, began appearing in 1974 and 1975, and because of the graffiti locals gave it the name \\"Spook Bridge\\". Legends and rumors Some of the most common tales associated with the bridge involve a dilapidated house that stands nearby, which as local folklore claims, once housed a couple, and the husband who resided there killed his wife before committing suicide. A different version of the story states that the couple was walking on the bridge when the husband shoved his wife off of the bridge and into the water, and the wife haunts the bridge, trying to climb onto the bridge from the river below. Another legend states that a high school couple was driving on the bridge when their car ran through the railings and off of the bridge, sweeping them into the river. It was rumored that if one drives onto the bridge, one can hear screaming and feel the vibrations of someone beating on the hood of the vehicle. It has also been rumored that a school bus full of children was driven off of one side of the bridge. Spook Bridge in its current state The destroyed section of the road on Old Quitman Hwy has been blocked off on both the Lowndes County and Brooks County entrances. The road is torn apart, and the asphalt has been ripped, cracked, and scorched by fires. The roadway and railings are covered with graffiti, and the cracks in the concrete are lined with broken glass. When flooding occurs, sections of the bridge sometimes become submerged under the flood water. Brooks County sheriffs have expressed a great deal of concern for the danger of the bridge and often patrol the abandoned roadway, making several arrests for trespassing. According to Brooks County sheriff, Richard A. Chafin, a murder occurred on the bridge and was believed to be a \\"drug deal gone bad\\". Chafin has stated that the bridge is dangerous and should be torn down, and some citizens of Valdosta are also supportive of the bridge's demolition. In popular media A feature film was produced in 2016 featuring stories dating back from the 1870s, and was shot in various Brooks County locations including abandoned bridge itself. The movie released October 25th, 2017.

In 2019, the site listed more cars for sale in Ireland than any other website. The site was founded in May 2005 by husband and wife team Fred and Geraldine Karlsson. The site currently has over 300,000 live ads.  History  The founders were inspired to set up the site after returning to Ireland from Sweden where they had used similar websites. Initially, the ads included their own belongings before real users started placing ads. By late 2008, DoneDeal was experiencing a notable growth in visitor figures – monthly visitors to the site had jumped from 175,000 per month in November 2007 to 561,000 in November 2008. The site became so popular in Ireland that €1bn worth of goods were sold through the site in 2011, a €300m increase from 2010. Following an independent ABC audit in 2011, it was found that DoneDeal had the most visited motoring classifieds website in Ireland. By late 2011 \\"DoneDeal\\" had become the fastest growing search term in Ireland for 2011 according to Google. In 2016, there were over almost 1 million ads placed in the motor section of DoneDeal. Business model While the site was originally free to use, a €3 charge was introduced after about a year. The site featured a system where people could place ads and pay by calling a special number which would bill to their phone, as well as credit or debit card and PayPal account. In 2012, the DoneDeal pricing model changed – with some ads reduced to €1 and others increased to €5. In 2015, free ads were re-introduced in the Clothes and Lifestyle, Baby & Kids, Music & Education, Sports & Hobbies and House & DIY sections with the remaining sections incurring a charge of between €1 and €5. In 2011, Oslo international media group Schibsted Media Group took a 50.09% stake in the company. In July 2015, the Irish-owned Distilled Media Group and the Schibsted Media Group announced the establishment of a combined business, Distilled SCH, which brings together the three iconic Irish brands: DoneDeal.ie, Daft.ie and Adverts.ie. Apps have played a part in the accessibility of DoneDeal with an iPhone app launched in 2011, followed by an Android app in 2012. DoneDeal ventured into television advertising for the first time in 2012 with a popular and amusing ad featuring a woman who sells her husband on DoneDeal. This was at a time where the number of monthly unique visitors to the site had increased to almost three million.

On 13 October 2010, Chief Executive Donald Tsang stated in the \\"Policy Address 2010–2011\\" that moral and national education would replace MCE to \\"strengthen national education\\". The government planned to introduce the new subject in primary schools in 2012 and secondary schools in 2013, and carried out a four-month consultation in 2011. Following the opposition from the public, the government postponed the commencement of the subject indefinitely.

It also claims to \\"enhance\\" students' commitments and contributions to analyse and judge personal, family, social, national and global issues.

It has been suggested \\"life event\\" exemplars being used as learning contexts to enable students to realise positive values. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (PTU), an organisation formed by different levels of teachers, believes that MNE is unnecessary, as the original civic education curriculum had already contained \\"national education\\".

On 29 July 2012, 30 organisations protested in a march. According to the organisers, over 90000 protestors, including parents and their children, joined in this march. Scholarism began their occupation of the Hong Kong government headquarters on 30 August 2012. Fifty members occupied the public park beneath the government offices, of which three began a hunger strike. The goal of the protest was, expressly, to compel the government to pull back its plans of Moral and National Education. The initial planned length of the occupation was three days. On 1 September, an open concert was held as part of the protest, with an attendance of 40,000; guest performers at the protest include RubberBand, C AllStar, Wong Ka Keung, Anthony Wong and others. During the event the three hunger-strikers ended their hunger strike, and were succeeded by a team of ten other hunger-strikers. The occupation of the government headquarters area exceeded the initial three-day duration, and on 3 September 2012 the Civil Alliance Against National Education announced that they would continue their occupation of the government headquarters area indefinitely. On 7 September, up to 120,000 attendees, including retired legislator Martin Lee, Cardinal Joseph Zen and businessman Jimmy Lai, attended the demonstration outside the government headquarters, filling the entire North Admiralty area; police said there were 36,000 attendees at 9.30 pm.Shirley Zhao (8 September 2012), \\"Record-high turnout for anti-national education protests\\".

It begins with infection of epithelial cells on the surface of the eye and retrograde infection of nerves serving the cornea. Primary infection typically presents as swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids (blepharoconjunctivitis), accompanied by small white itchy lesions on the corneal surface. The effect of the lesions varies, from minor damage to the epithelium (superficial punctate keratitis), to more serious consequences such as the formation of dendritic ulcers. Infection is unilateral, affecting one eye at a time. Additional symptoms include dull pain deep inside the eye, mild to acute dryness, and sinusitis. Most primary infections resolve spontaneously in a few weeks. Healing can be aided by the use of oral and topical antivirals. Subsequent recurrences may be more severe, with infected epithelial cells showing larger dendritic ulceration, and lesions forming white plaques. The epithelial layer is sloughed off as the dendritic ulcer grows, and mild inflammation (iritis) may occur in the underlying stroma of iris. Sensation loss occurs in lesional areas, producing generalised corneal anaesthesia with repeated recurrences. Recurrence can be accompanied by chronic dry eye, low grade intermittent conjunctivitis, or chronic unexplained sinusitis. Following persistent infection the concentration of viral DNA reaches a critical limit. Antibody responses against the viral antigen expression in the stroma can trigger a massive immune response in the eye. The response may result in the destruction of the corneal stroma, resulting in loss of vision due to opacification of the cornea. This is known as immune-mediated stromal keratitis. HSV infection is very common in humans. It has been estimated that one third of the world population have recurrent infection. Keratitis caused by HSV is the most common cause of cornea-derived blindness in developed nations. Therefore, HSV infections are a large and worldwide public health problem. The global incidence (rate of new disease) of herpes keratitis is roughly 1.5 million, including 40,000 new cases of severe monocular visual impairment or blindness each year. Signs and symptoms =Primary infection= herpetic blepharitis Primary infection most commonly manifests as blepharoconjunctivitis i.e. infection of lids and conjunctiva that heals without scarring. Lid vesicles and conjunctivitis are seen in primary infection. Corneal involvement is rarely seen in primary infection. =Recurrent eye infection= Recurrent herpes of the eye is caused by reactivation of the virus in a latently infected sensory ganglion, transport of the virus down the nerve axon to sensory nerve endings, and subsequent infection of ocular surface. The following classification of herpes simplex keratitis is important for understanding this disease: =Dendritic ulcer (Epithelial keratitis)= Fluorescein-stained cornea: geographic epithelial defects This classic herpetic lesion consists of a linear branching corneal ulcer (dendritic ulcer). During eye exam the defect is examined after staining with fluorescein dye. The underlying cornea has minimal inflammation. Patients with epithelial keratitis complain of foreign-body sensation, light sensitivity, redness and blurred vision. Focal or diffuse reduction in corneal sensation develops following recurrent epithelial keratitis. In immune deficient patients or with the use of corticosteroids the ulcer may become large and in these cases it is called geographic ulcer. =Disciform keratitis (endothelial keratitis)= Endothelial keratitis manifests a central endothelitis in a disc-shaped manner. Longstanding corneal edema leads to permanent scarring and is the major cause of decreased vision associated with HSV. Localized endothelitis (localized inflammation of corneal endothelial layer) is the cause of disciform keratitis. =Other forms= * Metaherpetic ulcer : is not due to live virus, results from inability of the corneal surface to heal. * Necrotizing keratitis * Keratouveitis : is usually granulomatous uveitis with large keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium. Cause HSV is a double-stranded DNA virus that has icosahedral capsid. HSV-1 infections are found more commonly in the oral area and HSV-2 in the genital area. Ocular herpes simplex is usually caused by HSV-1. Diagnosis Impression cytology smear stained by Papanicolaou stain shows the presence of a multinucleated giant cell A specific clinical diagnosis of HSV as the cause of dendritic keratitis can usually be made by ophthalmologists and optometrists based on the presence of characteristic clinical features. Diagnostic testing is seldom needed because of its classic clinical features and is not useful in stromal keratitis as there is usually no live virus. Laboratory tests are indicated in complicated cases when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain and in all cases of suspected neonatal herpes infection: * Corneal smears or impression cytology specimens can be analyzed by culture, antigen detection, or fluorescent antibody testing. Tzanck smear, i.e.Papanicolaou staining of corneal smears, show multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusion bodies, however, the test is low in sensitivity and specificity. * DNA testing is rapid, sensitive and specific. However, its high cost limits its use to research centers. * Demonstration of HSV is possible with viral culture. * Serologic tests may show a rising antibody titer during primary infection but are of no diagnostic assistance during recurrent episodes. Treatment Treatment of herpes of the eye is different based on its presentation: epithelial keratitis is caused by live virus while stromal disease is an immune response and metaherpetic ulcer results from inability of the corneal epithelium to heal: =Epithelial keratitis= Epithelial keratitis is treated with topical antivirals, which are very effective with low incidence of resistance. Treatment of the disease with topical antivirals generally should be continued for 10–14 days. Aciclovir ophthalmic ointment and Trifluridine eye drops have similar effectiveness but are more effective than Idoxuridine and Vidarabine eye drops. Oral acyclovir is as effective as topical antivirals for treating epithelial keratitis, and it has the advantage of no eye surface toxicity. For this reason, oral therapy is preferred by some ophthalmologists. Ganciclovir and brivudine treatments were found to be equally as effective as acyclovir in a systematic review. Valacyclovir, a pro-drug of acyclovir likely to be just as effective for ocular disease, can cause thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/Hemolytic-uremic syndrome in severely immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS; thus, it must be used with caution if the immune status is unknown. Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in the presence of active herpetic epithelial keratitis; patients with this disease who are using systemic corticosteroids for other indications should be treated aggressively with systemic antiviral therapy. The effect of interferon with an antiviral agent or an antiviral agent with debridement needs further assessment. =Stromal keratitis= Herpetic stromal keratitis is treated initially with prednisolone drops every 2 hours accompanied by a prophylactic antiviral drug: either topical antiviral or an oral agent such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. The prednisolone drops are tapered every 1–2 weeks depending on the degree of clinical improvement. Topical antiviral medications are not absorbed by the cornea through an intact epithelium, but orally administered acyclovir penetrates an intact cornea and anterior chamber. In this context, oral acyclovir might benefit the deep corneal inflammation of disciform keratitis. =Metaherpetic ulcer= Treatment includes artificial tears and eye lubricants, stopping toxic medications, performing punctal occlusion, bandage contact lens and amniotic membrane transplant. These measures intend to improve corneal epithelial healing. Antiviral medication may reduce the risk of HSV keratitis recurring in people having a graft due to HSV infection and may improve the chances of graft survival.

Cook Islands mythology comprises historical myths, legends, and folklore passed down by the ancient Cook Islanders over many generations. Many of the Cook Islands legends were recited through ancient songs and chants. The Cook Islands myths and legends have similarities to general Polynesian mythology, which developed over the centuries into its own unique character. Creation myth In Cook Islands creation myth, the universe was conceived of as being like the hollow of a vast coconut shell, the interior of this imaginary shell being Avaiki, the under world, and the outer side of the shell as the upper world of mortals. At various depths there are floors of different levels, or lands, which communicate with each other. At the very bottom of this coconut is a thick stem tapering to a point, which represents the beginning of all things. This point is the dwelling of a spirit without human form called Te aka ia Roe (The root of all existence). The entire fabric of the universe is constantly sustained by this primary being. Above this extreme point is Te tangaengae (Breathing) or Te vaerua (Life) this being is stout and stronger than the former one. The thickest part of the stem is Te manava roa (The long lived) the third and last of the primary, ever- stationary, sentient spirits, who together form the foundation, permanence, and well-being of the rest of the universe. We now advance into the interior of the supposed coconut shell, the lowest part of Avaiki, where the sides of the shell almost meet, there lives a goddess of flesh and blood called Varima te takere (The very beginning). Her territory is very narrow, so much so that her knees touch her chin, no other position being possible. Varima te takere was very anxious for progeny. One day she plucked off part of her right side, like a fruit from a tree, and it became the first human being, the first man Avatea (or Vatea). He became the father of gods and men, having the right half of a man and the left half a fish, split down the middle. The land assigned by the Great Mother to Avatea was called Te paparairai (The thin land). Varima te takere continued to pluck from her body more pieces of flesh, from which more children were created, the right side of her body created gods, and from her left side of her body she created goddesses.

Life Gregor Harlip Kreuder was born in Aachen, the son of a Kammersänger. He enrolled as a piano student at the Cologne Conservatory in 1910, where he performed his first concert one year later, and at music academies in Munich, Berlin and Hamburg. After World War I he worked as a composer of musical performances at the Hamburg Kammerspiele theatre, at the Munich Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz, as well as of several Kabarett and revue productions. In the meantime he continued his studies, taking his exams at the Munich Academy of Music in 1924. In 1925 he was employed as Kapellmeister at the Deutsches Theater München, and conducted theatre ensembles, first in Munich and then in Berlin, where he worked with Max Reinhardt. In 1930 he met with Friedrich Hollaender, whom he assisted arranging the musical score of Josef von Sternberg's film The Blue Angel starring Marlene Dietrich. During the 1930s and 40s he became one of the most sought-after German musical film composers; his credits run to some 150 movies. Several songs, performed by stars like Zarah Leander or Marika Rökk, are popular and covered up to today. Kreuder joined the Nazi Party in 1932, however, he resigned his membership in 1934.Michael H.

As an alternate route (unrelated to the Kaladan Multi-Model project) to northeast India, India is also developing railway route from Cox's Bazar deep water port to South Tripura district by rehabilitating the railway link from Santirbazar in India to Feni in Bangladesh, where a road and rail bridge is being built to connect the \\"Belonia, India - Parshuram, Bangladesh road and rail crossing checkposts\\", this will reduce traffic through Sittwe, but will provide strategically redundancy if there is a war with China.As Smart as Sittwe: Going North-East by South-East, First Post, 2019. History This project will reduce distance from Kolkata to Sittwee by approximately 1328 km and will reduce the need to transport good through the narrow Siliguri corridor, also known as Chicken's Neck. Initially India had tried to persuade Bangladesh to offer transport and transit rights to the northeastern states. However, Bangladesh has consistently refused to grant such rights, including access to its Chittagong port, which is less than 200 km away from Agartala, the capital of Tripura. The project is being piloted and funded by the Ministry of External Affairs (India). The preliminary feasibility studies were carried out by Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES). Construction work on Sittwe port and the boat jetty in Paletwa, as well as the dredging work, will be executed by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), with Essar Projects Ltd, a division of the Essar Group appointed in May 2010 as the main contractor. Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project initially faced problems such as underestimation of the road length in Myanmar and plans to construct hydro-electric projects — Chhimtuipui River and Lungleng River — on two tributaries of the Kaladan River followed by another project downstream. That the first two projects are being built by one public sector undertaking and the third is being constructed by another PSU (Public Sector Unit) has also led to coordination issues. Due to construction of this hydro electrical projects, Navigation of boats could be effected. The project includes a waterway component of 158 km on Kaladan River from Sittwe to Paletwa in Myanmar and a road component of 109 km from Paletwa to Zorinpui along the India-Myanmar border in Mizoram. The highway road project will enhance cross border trade between India and Myanmar and will also provide an alternate outlet to the landlocked North East which is heavily dependent on the narrow ‘Chicken’s Neck’ at Siliguri Construction of cross-border road between Mizoram in India and Myanmar began in April 2018. The road project is part of the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project. India has already completed the rest of the Kaladan project work in Myanmar. This includes construction of the Sittwe Port on Lakadan river mouth in Rakhine, construction of a river terminal 158 km upstream at Paletwa and dredging of the Kaladan river. Sittwe is the capital of Rakhine State in south-western Myanmar. It is located at the mouth of the Kaladan river, which flows into Mizoram in north-eastern India. The new route through Sittwe would significantly lower the cost and distance of movement from Kolkata to Mizoram and beyond. India has for years sought transit access through Bangladesh to ship goods to the landlocked north-eastern States. At present, the only route to this region from the rest of India is through a narrow strip of Indian territory nicknamed the Chicken's Neck in West Bengal. The preliminary feasibility studies were carried out by Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES). The 109 km cross-border road connects Paletwa river terminal to Zorinpui on the Mizoram border in Myanmar. The road will help connect Mizoram with the Sittwe Port in Rakhine State of Myanmar, upon the completion of construction in December 2019. The road project will enhance cross border trade between India and Myanmar and will also increase trade in the region. Once the road project is completed, it will belong entirely to Myanmar. The road project involves construction in dense forests and insurgency affected areas. It also passes through areas that have the presence of Myanmar rebel group called Arakan Army. Both the countries signed a MoU which agreed to facilitate the movement of project personnel, construction material and equipment to expedite work on the highway. The estimated investment for the construction of the road is R1,600 crore. The road construction contract was awarded to Delhi-based C&C; Constructions in June 2017. The road is designed to be a national highway double lanes standard. The Indian government has sanctioned R1,011.52 crore for the construction of the project. The construction of 87.18kmlong road component in Mizoram side began in 2010 and is being worked by two companies – RDS Project Limited and Orisa based Atlanta ARSS (JV). About 81.12 per cent of physical work has been completed so far and 64.58 km of road has been black-topped, formation cutting of 85.41 km, out of 87.18-km-long road, has also been completed. Of the eight bridges, seven are under construction and 335 out of 428 culverts have also been already completed. On the Indian side, work is on to extend the Aizawl-Saiha National Highway by 90 km to the international border at Zorinpui. Also, a R6,000-crore project is underway for four-laning the 300-km highway from Myanmar border to Aizawl to ensure the faster movement of goods between Sittwe and Mizo capital of Aizawl in the North West which is close to the Barak Valley of Assam. Development On 19 April 2016 Indian minister General VK Singh informed that 66% of the new 2-lane-per-direction 12-meter-wide 99.83 km National Highway 502A (NH502A) starting from NH-54 at Lawngtlai to Zorinpui in Mizoram on Indian side is done and will be completed by June 2018. Other aspects of the project including the port, waterways and 109 km Zorinpui on the India- Myanmar border to Paletwa highway road in Myanmar will be completed by April 2019.Kaladan project to be completed by April 2019, Published: April 2016 Mr Lalrinngheta, a Project Site Engineer on the India side, also reported the work is ongoing.Title: India's long highway to Myanmar starts to take shape, The Guardian, Sept 2015. In April 2017, the Sitwee port AND IWT Paletwa jetty were ready and operational. In April 2017, India handed over the operation of completed Sittwe port and Inland Water Terminal at Paletwa to Myanmar. In June 2017, India handed six gas tanker cargo vessels worth US$81.29 million (K110.08 billion) to the Myanmar government to transport gas to north-east India via Manipur. Work on the port in Sittwe and the IWT in Paletwa, Chin State, is in its final stages, and the six cargo vessels are meant to facilitate transportation of goods from Sittwe to Paletwa. The $81.29 million cost of the vessels was met through a grant from India. The construction work was assigned to IWT in October 2012, the keels were laid in March 2013 and the vessels were launched between April and December 2016. On completion of the tests and trials at Yangon, the vessels reached Sittwe in March 2017. Acceptance trials were completed in April 2017 in Sittwe.vessels handed over to Myanmar by India, Mizzima, 2 June 2017. In June 2017, 90 km 2-lane route from Indo-Myanmar border at Zorinpui to Tuipang is almost complete. From Tuipang the national highway is being further upgraded from 2-lane to all- weather 4-lane from NH 54 Lawngtlai to Aizawl in Mizoram. In June 2017, after several upward budget revisions and troubles in finding contractors, the INR1,600-crore (US$250 million) contract has been finally awarded to an Indian company C&C; construction for building 109-km road connecting IWT Paletwa river terminal to Zorinpui in Mizoram border. The contractor would open offices at Sittwe, Paletwa and Yangon in Myanmar, mobilise men and machine during the monsoon and start construction after the monsoon in October. As of May 2018, India has awarded all the contract for 100 km 4-lane Aizawl-Zorinpui highway within India and 2 km Zorinpui-Kaletwa 2-lane highway within Myanmar, which will be completed by the 2019.India ramps up Myanmar ties to gain foothold in ASEAN, Myanmar Times, May 2018.Still under construction, The Statesman, 13 May 2018.

(pbk.). p. 38.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 136. His parents were John and Margaret (Kee) Boggs. He was the oldest of seven children. The Boggs family moved to western Virginia in 1807. Boggs owned a large farm in Pendleton County, Virginia, now West Virginia, and had seventeen slaves to operate it. He was engaged in politics over the years, holding the office of county sheriff in 1843, being a justice of the county in 1842 and again from 1852 to 1862 and being a state representative in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1861 to 1862. He became a prosperous merchant in Franklin, Virginia, now West Virginia, mainly occupied in that business by 1860. American Civil War service Boggs was a brigadier general of the 18th Brigade in the Virginia militia at the outbreak of the civil war. As Virginia forces were organized into the Provisional Army of Virginia prior to their incorporation in the Confederate States Army, Boggs became a brigadier general in that force between April 27, 1861 and June 8, 1861 when it was incorporated into the Confederate Army. Boggs remained with the Virginia militia forces, commanding a brigade in the Valley District in May 1861. After a quiet period, Boggs's men were called for duty in November 1861. The call was met with some resistance because of the divided loyalties of the population in western Virginia. Boggs himself had a brother who became a captain in the Union Army. Boggs had to request help from the Confederate Army to get the men from the area to report for militia duty. As troops gathered, Boggs was once again in command of the small brigade in the Valley District. Stonewall Jackson then ordered the local militia, including Boggs's brigade and those of James Harvey Carson and Gilbert S. Meem, to report to Winchester, Virginia for training. After a short time, parts of the brigade went to Moorefield, Virginia, now West Virginia, to fight Union home guard militia units. In early January, Jackson moved against the Union held towns of Romney and Bath (Berkeley Springs) and occupied those towns. Boggs's men protected Jackson's left flank along the Potomac River south of Romney. After Jackson took possession of the area, Boggs's men were split into smaller units which took shelter and were placed on guard duty in the South Branch Valley area. On February 3, 1862, under orders of January 30, 1862 from the Confederate States Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin, the garrison left by Jackson to hold Romney departed for Winchester, Virginia because of its vulnerable location and a build-up of Union troops intent on retaking the town.Cozzens, Peter. Shenandoah 1862: Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008. . pp. 97, 101, 103, 107. The Union force re-entered the town without opposition on February 6, 1862. Death By the end of 1861, the 65-year-old Boggs was worn out by his responsibilities, campaigning and harsh winter weather. After his troops were deployed for the winter guard duty and shelter after the capture of Romney, Boggs returned to his home in Pendleton County, where he died on January 28, 1862. He was buried in Mount Hiser Cemetery in Franklin, West Virginia. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Acting Confederate) Notes References * Allardice, Bruce S. More Generals in Gray.

In the 19th century, the Kamp was the social hub of the Doberan, because it was surrounded by the most prestigious buildings in the town.  History  In 1793, following the foundation of Germany's first seaside resort in Heiligendamm, the Duke of Mecklenburg, Frederick Francis I, pressed ahead with the development of Doberan (the name was changed to Bad Doberan in the 1920s) as his ducal summer residence. As well as being the residence of the Duke and his court, Doberan also became the meeting place for the social elite of the state. Whilst Heiligendamm attracted visitors with its bathing establishments, Doberan drew them mainly with its variety of amusements and social events. But the town need to be further developed. The triangular cow pasture situated in front of the Logierhaus was fenced off with barriers, footpaths were laid and it was turned into a park. Thus, the Kamp became the centre of Doberan. A restaurateur from Milan, Gaetano Medini, offered food in a tent, and concerts by the Duke's orchestra were held here. The Kamp was festively illuminated during the bathing season and there were firework displays. Since the original thatched houses of Doberan's villagers were not in keeping with the image of a ducal summer residence, the Duke forbade their construction and paid subsidies for the construction of tiled houses. With the engagement of Carl Theodor Severin, an architect, in 1802, several prestigious buildings were erected around the Kamp, including a theatre, the Logierhaus, a palace and a salon building (Salongebäude).  Red Pavilion  The Red, or Little, Pavilion In spring 1808 the tents and wooden stalls on the Kamp were so dilapidated that the duke ordered the construction of a permanent building \\"in the shape of a funnel\\". The prototype was supposed to have been a building that Frederick Francis had seen during his Danish exile near Altona. Severin changed the drawing given to him, but kept the basic idea. On 17 May 1808 construction began and was completed in time for the start of the bathing season. The octagonal building represents a link between Classicism and Chinoiserie. The external shape of the building has been preserved, by contrast the interior was completely destroyed. Originally the Red or Little Pavilion (Roter or Kleiner Pavillon) was used as a bar and music stage. Today it acts as a modern art gallery sponsored by the Red Pavilion Art Society (Kunstverein Roter Pavillon). The exhibitions mainly contain works by regional artists.  White Pavilion  The Great, or White, Pavilion In 1810 Severin was supposed to have been contracted for the construction of a large music pavilion and other shopping pavilions, that were to be rented for income. Due to a lack of finance the work was constantly delayed. In 1812 Severin had to complete the shops at the behest of the duke. They were built rather hastily in order to ensure they could be rented during the bathing season. Their final completion was carried out in 1813, together with the White Pavilion (Weißer Pavillon). The shopping pavilions were demolished in 1860 as they were no longer used. The White Pavilion, also referred to in the literature as the Great Pavilion (Großer Pavillon), was built on the northern side of the Kamp. Above the ground floor, a second floor was built as a belvedere with an all-round balcony. The floor plan is an elongated octagon, in which there is an oval room of 14.5 metres by 10.4 metres. Around the building runs a walkway with 24 columns. The ceiling of the hall is vaulted. The interior was partially restored during renovations in 1974-1976. Today the White Pavilion is used as a café.

The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown, commanded by General José Antonio Andrade, and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire, commanded by José María Morelos y Pavón. The battle resulted in a victory for the Mexican rebels.  Context  José María Morelos had by this time in the war, made it his goal to conquer the mountainous region of south east Mexico. This was made difficult because such a conquest also involved taking the more heavily defended Spanish cities of Acapulco and Oaxaca. To accomplish his objectives, he moved to cut off communications between Mexico City and the port at Veracruz. To accomplish this, Morelos had to occupy the city of Puebla or Orizaba as both these cities fell between these objectives. While based in Tehuacán, Morelos reviewed the defenses at Orizaba and decided that its capture would be the most strategically viable of the two. He decided on Orizaba also in part because of the large sums of money and property in the city belonging to the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Morelos marched from Tehuacán on 25 October with his army which was made up of around 10,000 soldiers. The column reached Orizaba on 28 October 1812. The city was defended by a garrison of around 600 Spanish loyalists commanded by Colonel José Antonio Andrade. In an effort to avoid a battle with such lopsided odds, Morelos sent a representative to discuss terms of surrender with the defending Spanish garrison who promptly refused his offer.Zárate, 1880; 324-325 The battle After the rejection of his offer of surrender, the insurgent forces advanced upon the city until arriving at the city Bartizan where Colonel Andrande had made his defensive stand. The rebel forces were there met with a strong barrage of artillery and musket fire causing relatively high casualties. Morelos retreated from his initial attack and again gathered his forces together while he waited for his soldiers from Santa Catarina and San Cristóbal to get into their strategic positions of attack. Morelos ordered General Hermenegildo Galeana to commence a frontal attack on the city. Morelos took direct command of the Santa Catarina column with which he was able to successfully take the Cerro del Borrego, one of the high ground areas surrounding the city. From this cerro, he commenced an artillery barrage of the city plaza. The loyalist colonel, José Antonio Andrade, caught in the crossfire between Galeana and Morelos, retreated from the city around 11:00 am when Morelos was finally able to enter in the wake of the Spanish.

During the First War of Castro, Savelli was given the title of Generalissimo and was put in command of a contingent of papal troops fighting the Dukes of Parma.

Instead, he was brought back to Rome and in 1642, he was elected Archbishop of Salerno with dispensation for not having yet received the presbyterate.

It was Australia's largest open pit zinc mine. Discovered by CRA Limited, mining was initiated by Pasminco, continued by Zinifex, then OZ Minerals and then MMG Limited who mined the project until closure. The property is currently owned by New Century Resources whose primary business is tailings reprocessing.  History  The Century zinc deposit was discovered by CRA Limited in 1990 on Waanyi land. Development of the mine commenced in 1997. The mine began open-pit production in 1999. Open-pit mining was completed at Century in August 2015, with final processing of Century-sourced ore occurring in November 2015. The last ore to be processed at Century was 450,000 tonnes that had been mined as part of the Dugald River mine's stoping trial, and then trucked to Century. The processing of this ore was completed in January 2016. The final shipment of zinc concentrate was exported from Karumba in late January 2016. During its 16 years of operation, Century was one of the largest zinc mines in the world, producing and processing an average of 475,000 tpa of zinc concentrate and 50,000 tpa of lead concentrate. Mill tailings generated from 16 years of operations from the Century open pit forms a Proven Reserve of 77.3 million tonnes at 3.1% zinc-equivalent, for 2,287,000 tonnes of contained zinc. New Century Resources, an Australian base metals development company, restarted Century Mine operations from August 2018 extracting zinc from the tailings.  Operations  Zinc and lead concentrates are exported via the port at Karumba on the Gulf of Carpentaria. The zinc ore is especially prized because of its low iron content, producing a high quality clean zinc concentrate that is keenly sought by the world's zinc smelters. The concentrate is mixed with water and transported to the port by a pipeline.

After the community forked Mambo into Joomla, the developer re-branded mambo-phpShop as VirtueMart, officially supporting the newer Joomla CMS. While current implementations may still function with Mambo CMS, and older editions of mambo-phpShop are still available to download, they are no longer actively supported. Originally developed by Sören Eberhardt-Biermann, in September 2009 a new team began developing VirtueMart 2. The new version was released in December 2011. In October 2012 the developer team declared end of life for VirtueMart 1.1 and since then VirtueMart 2 is no longer maintaining Joomla 1.5 compatibility. Features VirtueMart supports an unlimited number of products and categories, with products assignable to multiple categories. Until version 3, it permitted the sale of downloadable products.http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=139327.msg489435#msg489435 That functionality is now mostly supported by separate, subscription plugins. It offers a catalog mode where the shopping cart features are turned off. VirtueMart supports multiple prices for a single product, based around shopper groups or a quantity range, and permits the use of a variety of different payment gateways. VirtueMart Features Because VirtueMart is an open-source e-commerce solution all the application code is openly visible in PHP. This allows PHP developers to view, update or customize the operation of the shopping cart. In addition VirtueMart itself offers simplified templates (called 'fly pages' in VirtueMart) structure that allows various shopping and cart page(s) to be edited as standard HTML and CSS. Notably new to VirtueMart 1.1.0 was the inclusion of the ability quickly to change themes for category, product, checkout and cart pages. VirtueMart Themes The cart is also integrated with Rapid 3.0, which enables transaction data to be sent directly from the customer's browser to the payment gateway without passing through the merchant's systems.

He is considered the founder of the antiquarian map trade.An Appreciation by Robert Stockwell Tooley was born on Michaelmas and adopted the nickname \\"Mick\\". Career Tooley was born and raised in Islington, London, and educated at the City of London School. Towards the end of World War I he enlisted in the Queen's Westminster Rifles. After his basic training he left for France and took part in the Battle of Cambrai, where he was one of 120 survivors from an initial force of 400 men. On being demobilised in 1919 and having no definite career plans, he came across an illustrated catalogue of antiquarian books, published by James Tregaskis of Great Russell Street. The idea of working in the bookselling field appealed to him, and armed with a letter of introduction he made the acquaintance of Francis Edwards Ltd., and was summarily employed. After World War I the book trade enjoyed a time of relative prosperity, but with the Wall Street collapse in 1929, economic depression hit the commercial sector in many countries, the secondhand book trade being no exception. In the 1930s Tooley left Francis Edwards Ltd and opened The Atlas Bookshop, just off Charing Cross Road, and started dealing almost exclusively in antiquarian maps. Between 1932 and 1934 he collaborated with a Mr M. Sinelnikoff of Orion Booksellers Ltd. Sinelnikoff's passion was old maps, charts and globes, and with Tooley's interest, a fertile conjunction of scholarly minds was created. Tooley had always been interested in Colour Plate books, and in 1935 Batsford published his first book on the subject Some English Books with Coloured Plates. When The Atlas Bookshop closed in 1936 Tooley started work at the Parker Gallery in Albemarle Street - the firm specialising in military and sporting prints as well as old maps. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Tooley found work as a telephone operator, but still worked with old books and maps in his spare time. In 1946 the management of Francis Edwards Ltd, keenly aware of Tooley's considerable business expertise and knowledge of old maps, invited him to rejoin the firm. Here he continued his research, spending long hours in the Map Room of the British Museum. His talents soon led to his being appointed a director of the firm. In 1949 his second book Maps & Map-makers was published, praised as a sound introduction and guide to a complex field, and running to many editions.National Library of Australia Tooley retired from Francis Edwards Ltd in 1975 and in 1979 joined Peter Scott and Peter Kalms in setting up a new company R.V.Tooley Ltd, he was joined by his stepson Douglas Adams and in October 1979 his stepson Stephen Luck joined them, first trading at Tring, Hertfordshire and then in the Spring of 1980 33 Museum Street, this company closed in 1982 and became Tooley Adams & Co. Together they developed the firm into one of the leading antique map dealers, supplying maps to dealers, museums and libraries all over the world.http://www.tooleys.co.uk/ \\"The Map Collector's Series\\" is widely regarded as the greatest of Tooley's achievements. The idea of producing a series of monographs on maps was first discussed in 1960 with Robert Stockwell. The interest generated by this idea was widespread and led to The Map Collector's Circle being formed in April 1963 under Tooley and David Schrire. The series was acclaimed throughout the world, and seen as an important contribution to cartography. It also led to the founding of the Carta Press, aimed at publishing authoritative works on cartography. The first publication, in 1968, was Maps of the African Continent and Southern Africa, and was followed in 1970 by County Atlases of the British Isles by R.A. Skelton of the Map Room of the British Museum. The Map Collector magazine was started by Tooley in 1977 when the Map Collector's Circle ceased publishing. Each issue of The Map Collector consisted of articles and information provided by respected authorities, collectors and dealers. Appreciation In his 75th year Tooley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The festschrift My Head is a Map was compiled in 1973 for his 75th birthday by Helen Wallis and Sarah Tyacke, both Map Librarians from the British Library and celebrated his contributions to the world of antiquarian maps.

Bierling, Seymour Gitin, The Phoenicians in Spain: An Archaeological Review of the Eighth-Sixth Centuries B.C.E. : A Collection of Articles Translated from Spanish, 2002, .Ann Neville, Mountains of silver & rivers of gold: the Phoenicians in Iberia, 2007, .María Eugenia Aubet, The Phoenicians and the West: Politics, Colonies and Trade, 2001, . The Phoenician name of the settlement is unknown. The modern toponym of Toscanos is due to Italian migrants who arrived in the area in the 18th century during the reign of Charles III. Geography Toscanos is located on a flattened hill overlooking the mouth of the Velez River at the Mediterranean. The hill is on the right bank of the river. At the height of Toscanos's prosperity around 700, the humidity index was higher than at present and large forests covered the Penibetic Mountains. History This settlement was one of a number of such colonies established in southern Spain around the 8thcentury to control trade with the Iberian settlements in the interior. The town does not seem to have been a major center for trade or industry involving any kind of metallic ores, but there are murex remains from the processing of dye and evidence of fishing for tuna, sturgeon, and eels as well as the associated processing of salting and preserved sauces like garum. They seem to have principally traded in agricultural goods, raising cattle, sheep, and goats; producing olive oil and wine; and hunting deer, boar, and wild cats. Toscanos began with an orderly street plan covering about and a fortified perimeter. From the middle of the 8thcentury, \\"large and luxurious\\" houses as wide as . In the 7thcentury, there was growth throughout the Phoenician colonies in Spain and Toscanos saw the construction of a great central \\"storehouse\\". The variety of surrounding homes suggests a diverse settlement of families including a mercantile elite, artisans, laborers, and slaves. Around 635, the town added a new fortified district and had a population between 1000 and 1500.. It covered about , 50% larger than the settlement at Agadir (Cadiz), and traded with Greece and Cyprus. Along with other Phoenician colonies, it underwent various crises during the 6thcentury. The settlement in particular suffered a collapse in its trade with the interior, and the large storehouse and grand houses around it ceased to be used in the early part of the century. The central settlement was abandoned around 550 and the rest were finally abandoned for Cerro del Mar on the other side of the Velez. With the rise of Carthaginian control over the Phoenician diaspora, political and commercial power in the area concentrated itself at nearby Malakat (Málaga). Legacy Asteroid 96086 Toscanos, discovered by astronomers during the second Palomar–Leiden Trojan survey in 1973, was named for the archaeological site.

The company operates eleven casinos in Colorado, Missouri, West Virginia, Alberta, and England. It also operates casinos on cruise ships for Diamond Cruise International, TUI, and Windstar. It owns a 67 percent share in Casinos Poland, which owns and operates seven casinos in Poland. History Century Casinos was formed in 1992 by several executives of Casinos Austria. In early 1993, the company signed on to manage a proposed riverboat casino in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. The proposal was blocked, however, by parish officials. The casino's developer bought out Century's management agreement in 1995 for $4 million, and relocated the project, which eventually opened as Isle of Capri Casino Lake Charles. In Indiana, which had recently legalized riverboat casinos, Century revealed two proposals in September 1993: one casino to be built in Gary in partnership with local investors, and another to be built in Vevay. Within months, the company dropped its plans for Gary, to focus on the Vevay project. Hospitality Franchise Systems (HFS) joined the project as a joint venture partner in 1994. In 1995, with the license application, still pending, Century and HFS sold the Vevay project to a partnership between Boomtown and Hilton. The project ultimately opened in 2000 as Belterra Casino, and Century received a total of $2.9 million for the sale. Century merged in March 1994 with Alpine Gaming, parent company of the Long Branch Saloon & Casino in Cripple Creek, Colorado. The casino was then renamed as Legends. Century then purchased the adjacent Womack's Saloon & Gaming Parlor in 1996 for $13.5 million. The combined property would take on the Century Casino name in 2010. Century's cruise ship casino business began in April 1994, when it began operating the casino on the Silver Cloud under a concession agreement with Silversea Cruises. In November 1994, the company submitted an application to build a casino in Portage des Sioux, Missouri. The application languished amid an informal moratorium on the issuance of new gaming licenses by the Missouri Gaming Commission. Century's development agreement with the city eventually expired. In January 1995, Century opened the Legends Casino at the Soboba Reservation, a tribal-owned bingo parlor and cardroom in Southern California. The company pulled out of its management agreement for the facility seven months later. In August 1995, the company proposed to build a casino in Alexandria, Louisiana. The Louisiana Riverboat Gaming Commission, however, did not award the one available casino license to Century, instead selecting the application for Horseshoe Bossier City. In November 1995, Century signed a $1.1-million deal to manage a casino planned for the Greek island of Rhodes, being developed by a consortium including Playboy Enterprises. The company turned over its duties to Playboy before the casino opened. Century moved its headquarters from Denver to Colorado Springs in 1996, to be closer to its casino properties in Cripple Creek. The company announced an agreement in 1998 to manage and co-own a casino to be built in a Marriott hotel in Prague. The Millennium Casino opened the following year. In 2000, Century was awarded a license for a casino in Caledon, South Africa, which it would manage and co-own. The Caledon Casino, Hotel & Spa opened later that year. In 2001, Century agreed to co-develop another casino in South Africa, to be built in the province of Gauteng. In 2006, the company opened a Century Casino & Hotel in Central City, Colorado and another property by the same name in Edmonton, Alberta. Century also shuffled its holdings in South Africa, acquiring a majority stake in the Monte Vista Casino in Newcastle (subsequently renamed as Century Casino Newcastle) and selling its interest in the Gauteng casino project. In 2007, the company paid $8.7 million to acquire a 33 percent stake in Casinos Poland. Century increased its stake to 67 percent in April 2013. In 2009, Century sold its casinos in Prague and South Africa. Century assumed the management of a casino at a Radisson hotel in Aruba (later a Hilton) in 2010. The management agreement ended in 2017. Century purchased the Silver Dollar Casino in Calgary, Alberta in 2010 for $10.5 million, and then rebranded it as Century Casino Calgary. Next, the company financed the development of the Century Downs Racetrack and Casino near Calgary, which it also managed from its opening in 2015. In October 2016, Century acquired the Apex Casino in St. Albert for $12.3 million, and then renamed it as Century Casino St. Albert. The expansion in Alberta continued in April 2019, when the company opened the Century Mile Racetrack and Casino in the Edmonton area. The company made moves to expand into two new markets in 2017.

Our museum is a place for exchanges and education, a place where arts open paths for better understanding of history and traditions from the Grass-fields region of Cameroon. History Musa Heritage Gallery in short Mus’Art Gallery, also known as the Grassfields Museum was established in December 1996 in honour of the Cameroonian artists Daniel Kanjo Musa (1930–1995) and his eldest son John Yuniwo Musa (1956–1996). The Mus'Art Gallery has been active in propagating the Nso' cultural heritage. The museum has been at the forefront of promoting Nso’ traditional artistry and craftsmanship. Mus’Art Gallery has a collection of over 400 objects most of which were created between 1970 and 2000. These varied and diverse objects range from bamboo work to wood carvings, basketry to pottery. The museum continues to acquire contemporary Cameroonian arts and crafts while maintaining a major focus on the Western Grass-fields region. This region is internationally renowned for having produced masterpieces of African art. These objects were appropriated by colonial missionaries and officers and removed from their place of origin to museums in Europe or the United States.

He told the students that the art world and museums apart from serving as platforms for learning and entertainment, offers numerous career opportunities and should be considered as the students moved into tertiary education in future. The museum continues to acquire contemporary Cameroonian arts and crafts while maintaining a major focus on the Western Grass-fields region. This region is internationally renowned for having produced masterpieces of African art. Heritage Collection =Grass-Fields Utensils= The collection includes utensils made by the Grassfield people,(peoples of North-West and West Cameroon). These utensils include pots, plates, dishes, spoons and knives. They are made using materials such as glass, plastic, enamel, wood, glazed pottery. Most of the utensils used in Cameroon now are imported with Chinaware being popular, as are enamel and plastic utensils. Traditional artists and craftsmen of the Grass-fields produced a lot of utensils which were used by the people. The utensils included bowls, baskets, trays, knives, spoons, pots etc. These utensils were made using locally available materials such as wood, clay and straw. The utensils were made from environmentally friendly materials. The technology was basic but entailed great skills in order to produce some of the utensils. Slavery, colonization, trading and the introduction of western education were all factors that contributed to the gradual under-utilisation and elimination of the traditional utensils. Historically the pursuit for western education in colonial schools, plantation workers who went to the coast to work in rubber or banana estates, kola nut traders who went to Northern Nigeria from the Grass-fields came back home with modern utensils. Those who were not fortunate to travel and stayed in the hinterlands and villages used traditional utensils, and were considered poor or primitive by those who acquired the Whiteman’s utensils. The utensils of the Grass-fields were used by the entire fabric of society from the Kings (Fons) to the commoners. However there were distinctions to what was meant for the Fons and the common man or peasants. It was customary in the Grass-fields for the Fons to have the best in terms of quality, beauty, aesthetics, and symbolism. Twins for instance in the Nso’ and Wimbum tribes had special containers in which palm oil meant for their food was preserved. In Nso’ with a history of polygamous homes, the family head (father) of the household kept the container in which palm oil was stored. With a specially fashioned wooden spoon he dished out palm oil which he sent through his little children who came into his living quarter with small clay pots from their mothers when it was cooking time. =Replicas= The museum continues to acquire contemporary Cameroonian arts and crafts while maintaining a major focus on the Western Grass-fields region.

Carson's men were part of Stonewall Jackson's force that moved to take the town of Bath, later Berkeley Springs, now in West Virginia, on January 3, 1862. Carson left the military on February 1, 1862 to go back to and become president of the Virginia State Senate. He returned to farming in 1864 and was active in law and real estate in Frederick County and in Leesburg in Loudoun County, Virginia after the war. Prior to the Civil War, Carson had been an assistant teacher, a farmer, a lawyer, a colonel in the Virginia militia in 1837, and a member of the Virginia General Assembly, first in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1844 to 1847, then in the Virginia State Senate from 1859 to 1864. Early life James Harvey Carson was born at Pleasant Green in Frederick County, Virginia, near Winchester, Virginia, on February 11, 1808.Allardice, Bruce S. More Generals in Gray. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1995. (pbk.). p. 50.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 166. His parents were Simon Carson, a farmer and militia officer, and Martha Williams, daughter of the first owner of Pleasant Green. Carson was an assistant teacher at Winchester Academy when he was 18 years old. He became a prominent lawyer at Winchester, Virginia and a farmer. He was elected a colonel in the Virginia militia in 1837. He was a state representative in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1844 to 1847 and a Virginia State Senator from 1859 to 1864. In 1859, Carson became a brigadier general of the 16th Brigade of the Virginia militia. American Civil War service James Harvey Carson's brigade was called into service at the outset of the Civil War to guard Harper's Ferry and the Shenandoah Valley while the forces of then Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston moved to join those of Brigadier General Pierre G. T. Beauregard at the First Battle of Bull Run. Carson and many of his men remained with the Virginia militia when many Virginia troops were transferred to the Confederate Army on June 8, 1861. Carson commanded the 3rd Division of the Virginia militia in the northern Shenandoah Valley in August 1861. After a quite period, Carson's men were called for duty in November 1861 along with the brigades of James Boggs and Gilbert S. Meem. In early January, Jackson moved against the Union held towns of Romney and Bath (Berkeley Springs) and occupied those towns. On January 3, 1862, Jackson detached Carson's brigade in order to attack Bath from the west while Jackson's force attacked from the east. By the time the militia arrived at the town, Jackson had already driven out the Union force.Allardice, 1995. p. 51.Cozzens, Peter. Shenandoah 1862: Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008. . pp. 70-76. Carson's brigade was left to occupy the town and set up winter quarters while Jackson moved on to take Romney. Later life Although Carson was praised for his intelligence and a number of admirable qualities, he apparently was not an outstanding military commander. He left the field voluntarily on February 1, 1862 when he returned to his Virginia Senate seat and was elected president of the Virginia Senate. He resigned from Virginia Senate in 1864 and returned to farming. Carson practiced law and became active in real estate work in Frederick County after the war. Later he moved his work to Leesburg, Virginia in Loudon County. James Harvey Carson died at Leesburg, Virginia on January 13, 1884. He was buried in the Carson graveyard at Pleasant Green in Frederick County, Virginia. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Acting Confederate) Notes References * Allardice, Bruce S.

The title makes reference to a speech given by Caliban in Act 2, Scene 2 of The Tempest by William Shakespeare: > I'll show thee every fertile inch o' the island; And I will kiss thy foot. I > prithee, be my god. The choice of title was one of several references to The Tempest throughout the ceremony. The track accompanied the Pandemonium section of the ceremony, which depicted the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Writing and recording Rick Smith started work on the music \\"And I Will Kiss\\" in June 2011. His brief from Danny Boyle, the creative director of the Olympics opening ceremony was simple: \\"Danny wanted to frighten people. He was certain that by the end [of the Pandemonium section], people had to be going: 'Christ, you can't possibly do that to us for the next three hours.' All the way along, he'd leave you with a sentence like that. That's the kind of direction that leaves you empowered.\\" Smith also said of the track: \\"There was to be nothing half- hearted or polite about it.\\" The track was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, apart from the shouts at the start of the track, which were recorded after one of the open-air rehearsals for the ceremony, as Smith recalls: \\"One night we'd run out of time and it was pouring with rain. We said, Look, can any of you just stay behind for a little while? We need to do some recording. And something like 1500 people stayed behind, getting pissed down on, and shouted for us. Those moments are beyond words.\\" The toll of the Olympic Bell, which also features on the track, was also recorded at night, in the rain and during rehearsals for the ceremony at the stadium; the sound engineers had to ask for the work to stop for half an hour so that they could successfully record it. The track features performances by percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie, (with her drum score arranged by Paul Clarvis and Rick Smith); drummers Paul Clarvis, Mike Dolbear, John Randall, Frank Ricotti, Ralph Salmins, Corrina Silvester and Ian Thomas; drum captains Barnaby Archer, Oliver Blake, Daniel Bradley, Rebecca Celebuski, Jason Chowdhury, Jonathan Colgan, Oliver Cox, Fabio de Oliveira, Mike Dolbear, Robert Eckland, Daniel Ellis, Ric Elsworth, David Holmes, Oliver Lowe, Nicola Marangoni, James O’Carroll, Gerard Rundell, Ramon Sherrington, Corrina Silvester, Alex Smith, Owain Williams and Justin Woodward; the 965 Pandemonium Drummers, made up of volunteers. Rick Smith initially had doubts about using amateur drummers, but drum arranger Paul Clarvis convinced him that every one of them was capable of the job in hand. \\"That was the journey that we took together\\", Smith said \\"We can do this, we can be heroes.\\" The LSO On Track orchestra was conducted by François-Xavier Roth, with assistant conductor Matthew Gibson, and was orchestrated by Geoffrey Alexander. The solo violin was played by Sonia Slany. The brass band was the Grimethorpe Colliery Band orchestrated and conducted by Sandy Smith, and the Nostalgia Steel Band also played on the track. The singers were Paul Ayres, Will Balkwill, Zoe Brown, Ronan Busfield, Pete Challis, Mark Connell, Emily Dickens, Kevin Doody, Elizabeth Drury, Ewan Gillies, James Hall, Johnny Herford, Katy Hill, Jimmy Holliday, Eloise Irving, Gareth John, Oliver Jones, Christopher Lowrey, Drew Mason, Philippa Murray, Sean Needham, Robyn Allegra Parton, Catherine Pope, Alison Rose, Domhnall Talbot, Reuben Thomas, Matt Thorpe and Amy Wood, and the vocal chanting at the start of the recording was from selected volunteers from the Pandemonium working men and women. Smith has talked of how the track took months to get right, in a quest to capture the right atmosphere. Olympic opening ceremony performance Industrial Britain. A slightly shortened version of the track was performed for the first time during the Pandemonium section of the ceremony, representing the Industrial Revolution in Britain, and includes a musical representation of a minute's silence, with whistling, during which time in the ceremony all action stopped and the dead of all wars were remembered. This motif that was whistled was used again at the end of the section as the Olympic rings came together in the sky, and is also featured in \\"Caliban's Dream\\", the track that accompanied the lighting of the Olympic cauldron near the end of the ceremony. The track is featured on the soundtrack of the ceremony, Isles of Wonder. It was digitally released as a downloadable track on iTunes at midnight on 28 July after the ceremony. A slightly modified version, featuring more emphasis on the percussive work from the live performance, features on a compilation entitled \\"Underworld A Collection 2\\", released in 2016. Reviews The London Evening Standard remarked on \\"the 17 thrilling, Industrial Revolution-charting minutes of \\"And I Will Kiss\\", as thumped out by Dame Evelyn Glennie.\\" The San Francisco Bay Guardian said \\"At 17 minutes, “And I Will Kiss” provided the backdrop for a shrewdly choreographed performance-art piece, chronicling Britain's historic transition from pastoral wonderland to industrial superpower. Recalling Peter Gabriel’s similarly high-concept OVO: The Millennium Show, held in London 12 years ago, the spectacle combined elaborate set-design and an extensive cast with a loud and pulsating, yet moody and subdued soundtrack. Industrialization represented a sense of forward progress, as well as a loss of innocence, for the British people, and Underworld's musical contribution aptly reflected this emotional complexity.\\" The Guardian called it \\"17 minutes of gloriously euphoric controlled chaos\\". Reviewing the album Isles of Wonder, on which the track features, the New Zealand Herald wrote \\"It's 'And I Will Kiss', which features percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie's rousing and often breathtaking drum score, that is the highlight of this vast and diverse musical landscape\\", calling the track \\"epic\\" and \\"Underworld's 17-minute pulsing synth and percussion-driven masterpiece\\", Q called the track \\"hair-raising.\\" while NME said it was \\"a formidable start to an epic show.

He is noted as a key scholar in environmental philosophyOliphant, J. et al.(2011) AQA Religious Ethics for AS and A2, Routledge,978-0-203-83021-5: pp222. and for his investigations into eco-friendly cities of the future.Strochlic, N. (2018). \\"Here's What Our Cities Could Look Like in 2121\\". National Geographic. 233 (2). For his research on these topics, the University of Wollongong awarded Marshall a doctorate and National Geographic assigned him as an explorer. Major projects In 2006, Alan Marshall founded The Ecomimicry Project which tries to meld ecology with Green innovation, sustainable art, and the ethics of environmentalism.See, for instance: A. Marshall (2007) ‘The Theory and Practice of Ecomimicry’, Sustaining Gondwana Working Paper Series, Issue 3, published by Curtin University of Technology: Perth, or A. Marshall (2009) ‘Wild Design: The Ecomimicry Project’, published by North Atlantic Books: Berkeley. Examples of designs that emerged from this project include: * a Hemp Sail Battle Cruiser for the Royal Australian Navy (in which a navy ship had its engines 'designed-out' and in their stead it is powered by sails made from eco-friendly hemp) * a manure-powered swimming pool heating system (in which a luxury pool is heated by the composted body waste of the swimmers) * a hairy- roofed Carpathian mountain village where the architecture is adorned with an engineered protective material that mimics the fur of local brown bears. These designs, illustrated by and large by Marshall, were compiled into the Wild Design book and then praised by the Australian art & design media.Downton, P. (2009) Review of Wild Design, Artlink, Vol. 29, No. 4.Wakely, M (2009) Design Inspired By Nature, ABC Radio National's By Design program. In January 2013, Marshall started the 'Ecotopia 2121' project; which (as noted by CNNCNN (2017) Utopian cities of the future re-imagine life on Earth, CNN Style/Architecture, January 2017 and The Independent) explores 'graphic future scenarios' of 100 'super-ecofriendly' cities across the world. In 2015, the master-class part of this project conducted at Mahidol University was awarded the 2015 Kenneth M. Roemer Innovative Course Design Award by the Society for Utopian Studies. Ecotopia 2121, the book of the project written and illustrated by Marshall, has attracted broad critical acclaim.Loewe, E.

ZMEScience,A. Micu, Ecotopia 2121 shows what perfectly eco-friendly cities would look like\\" ZMEScience, Jan 29th 2018. Lithuanian Radio Television, and Publishers Weekly variously declared it \\"curious and creative\\", \\"adventurous\\", \\"impressive\\", \\"visionary\\", and \\"monumental\\". Ecotopia 2121 was put on Resurgence and Ecologist magazine's Book of the Year list, won a Silver Medal at the 2017 Nautilus Book Awards and placed 1st in the 'Future Forecasts' category of the 2016 Green Book Festival, whilst the 'London 2121' cityscape from the book was chosen by the Museum of London to be displayed within their 2018 London Visions exhibition. A technophile reviewer in Strange Horizons, in contrast, indicated that Ecotopia 2121 was 'offensive fluff' without seriousness' and warned people 'not to read it under any circumstance'. In early 2016, Marshall began a new project in urban ecology called FrankencitiesMicu, A. (2018) Ecotopia 2121 shows what perfectly ecofriendly cities may look like, ZMEScience, 29 January 2018 which details the worst-case scenarios of emerging environmental problems in a series of cities around the world whilst comparing them to the insights offered by the Dr. Frankenstein story. With projects such as these, Marshall has often been labeled as 'anti-science'. In response, he has explained he is a 'science critic' and not 'anti-science' (in the same manner that a 'film critic' is not 'anti-film'). For the Frankencities project and for the Ecotopia 2121 project, Marshall developed a novel urban design methodology known as 'The Literary Method of Urban Design'See, for example: 'The Literary Method of Urban Design', Focus Magazine, April 2019. which is not so much about design but more about inventing new social change strategies.Marshall, A. (2018) 'The Fantasy Method of Urban Design', Diseña 12, February 2018 issue -- available in Spanish and English via Diseña. A film scripted by Alan Marshall about this methodology was published by National Geographic Indonesia\\"Memprediksi Perkotaan Masa Depan dengan Bantuan Karya Sastra\\", National Geographic Indonesia, March 18th, 2019. and became an 'official selection' at a number of film festivals across AsiaThe Literary Method of Urban Design movie was screened as part of the Kuala Lumpur Environmental Film Festival (Malaysia), the 9FilmFest (Bangkok, Thailand), and the \\"To Save and Protect\\" Ecological Film and TV Festival in Khanty-Mansiysk (Siberia). and Europe.For example, The Literary Method of Urban Design movie was part of the Саратовские Страдания Docudrama Film Festival (Saratov, Russia). Prior to his 21st century work in the eco-design field, Marshall was mainly involved in eco-philosophy and techno-criticism. In the 1990s, Marshall developed a postmodern version of the Human–Nature relationship,Marshall, A (1998) 'A Postmodern Natural History of the World, Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science', Part C, Vol. 34 Part C, No 1, 137-164 one that throws into doubt the very concepts of Humanity and Nature.Marshall, A (2002) 'The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science', Imperial College Press/World Scientific: London & Singapore. Marshall's approach is heavily influenced by the science of ecology but has been criticized as privileging one school of ecology, i.e., 'community ecology', over others such as systems ecology and the ecology of Gaia.de Laplante, K.

It was founded by Skrillex, Tim Smith, Kathryn Frazier, and Clayton Blaha in 2011. Skrillex announced the label on August 17, 2011. The label's first release was Porter Robinson's Spitfire. The name \\"Owsla\\" is a reference to Richard Adams' fantasy novel Watership Down, in which it refers to the governing caste in a society of anthropomorphized rabbits. History In 2012, Owsla launched a monthly subscription, The Nest, with benefits including early access to Owsla releases. In 2013, Bromance Records partnered up with Owsla to create an American branch titled Bromance US with releases from Gesaffelstein, Illangelo, Brodinski and LOUISAHHH!!!. A year later, Owsla launched the Nestivus Charity Campaign, a series of holiday initiatives with all proceeds going to the international music nonprofit, Bridges for Music. On September 18, 2016, Owsla celebrated five years of establishment with a party in Los Angeles. In a video published by Owsla, Skrillex spoke about the establishment. He said \\"I make music 'cause I love music and it all starts from there. And I surround myself with good people that I believe in as well. I think it’s important to create your family.\\" The General Manager of Owsla, Blaise DeAngelo asserted that Skrillex previously, like many other artists, had issues with record labels, implying that it caused him to create his own. Owsla was described as a label started for electronic music artists who \\"couldn’t get good label deals or resources and support they needed.\\" Porter Robinson's Spitfire was the label's debut release. Releases that followed, such as Zedd’s Shave It, Gesaffelstein’s Aleph and What So Not’s Jaguar, were described as prominent. Owsla Head of A&R; Chris Morris explained that \\"In order for an artist to be signed, there has to be that passion from the top down,\\" asserting that it is an \\"artist-driven\\" company. On May 5, 2017, Owsla released an annual compilation album, Howsla. It was described by Pitchfork as a \\"a focused take that’s largely modeled on bassline house, a style from the northern UK that’s distinguished by greasy low-end melodies, hard-thwacked drums, and a slippery, skippy sense of swing.\\" Subsidiaries of Owsla include Nest HQ, a website dedicated to giving exposure to electronic music artists and Owsla Goods, a 'fashion wing'.

Origins of the term Post-blackness as a term was coined by Thelma Golden, director of Studio Museum in Harlem, and conceptual artist Glenn Ligon to describe, as Touré writes, “the liberating value in tossing off the immense burden of race-wide representation, the idea that everything they do must speak to or for or about the entire race.” In the catalogue for \\"Freestyle\\", a show curated by Golden at the Studio Museum in Harlem, she defined post-black art as that which includes artists who are “adamant about not being labeled ‘black’ artists, though their work was steeped, in fact deeply interested, in redefining complex notions of blackness.” Thelma Golden, Freestyle, exhibition catalogue. (New York: Studio Museum in Harlem, 2001), 14. In his book, Who's Afraid of Post Blackness? What it Means to be Black Now, Touré, uses this term to describe black identity in the 21st century. According to Touré it is nowadays difficult to find a clear definition of what is black in terms of African-American culture. The post-black generation differentiates itself by the former one in the way they grew up. Their parents grew up in segregation, having to fight for equal rights. Touré claims that blackness became a constructed identity, to defend themselves efficiently as a group. He calls it “boxed into niggerdom”.(21) The attempt to define it results most often in the mixing up of definitions to find an identity in culture or in biological terms. This results often in racial patriotism, racial fundamentalism or racial policing. Additionally, post-blackness has not only to deal with the definition of being black, but with the authenticity of blackness. Touré comes to the point that blackness is too difficult and is too wide-ranging to have a simple definition. However, he does not say that post- blackness signifies the end of blackness, but allows for variation in what blackness means and can mean to be accepted as the truth. He differentiates between post-blackness and post-racial: in his opinion race still does exist, and he warns against conflating it with post-racial: post-racial would suggest colorblindness, and the claim that race does not exist or that society would be beyond the concept of race; in his opinion, this would be a naïve understanding of race in America. Touré sees post-blackness as such: “We are like Obama: rooted in but not restricted by Blackness”. Duke Literature and African-American Studies Professor Wahneema Lubiano defines post-black as the time when “you are no longer caught by your own trauma about racism and the history of Black people in the United States”. UC Santa Cruz professor Derek Conrad Murray claims that there was a “dogmatic transference of trauma”. Today there are identity liberals as well as identity conservatives, who still try to define and preserve a chosen definition of blackness. According to Touré, this search for an identity derives from being constantly reminded, as a black person, of the status of the other. Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye is a famous literary example of this. Facts and statistics In 2003, Forbes magazine may have proclaimed Oprah Winfrey the country's first black woman billionaire, but still most of the black middle class was in this period part of the lower middle class. Since the election of president Barack Obama, Darryl Pinckney is claiming, it has become apparent that being black middle-class is not as elitist as it used to be. The new black elite has become so large that being middle-class has become quite normal. Eugene Robinson states in Disintegration: The Splintering of Black America (2010) that it is not the black poor who are trying to redefine black America. He claims that “pre-civil right one-nation black America” does not exist anymore, and that blacks do not share anything more than a few symbols left over from civil rights history. The black mainstream is now part of the economic and cultural mainstream of America. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, on the other hand, states in the 2010 report that the median income of blacks had fallen from $32,584 to $29,328, compared to the national median income of $49,777. So while 43.7 percent of whites were categorized as middle-class, the percentage of black middle-class fell to 38.4 percent. The rest of the black population was divided into 29 percent working-class and 23.5 percent living in poverty. Definitions of blackness Blackness has been defined in many ways. The following are examples which tried to define Blackness through inheritance or political or cultural rules. =Authenticity of blackness= This term is used define the division that is being made by blacks themselves, in terms of what is authentically or genuinely black. Sexual orientation, regional variety, geographical diversity, class location or religion can be a reason for exclusion from a particular black group and their beliefs. A single “black identity” may have served well in times of slavery but is in his opinion not sufficient to serve as a means to define race. Blackness, or who and what is black, has been tried to define in sociological, biological or political terms. =Authenticity of blackness in hip-hop music= Authenticity in hip- hop music refers to whether or not artists exhibits exemplary identification with blackness as it pertains to historical struggle. The idea of authenticity in hip-hop is fluid and ever-changing. An artist's authenticity is inextricably linked with the artists' blackness. A fluid depiction of whiteness causes there to be more defining and re-defining of what blackness is as black people are marked as a racial \\"other\\" by the changing parameters of whiteness. =The Kinship Schema= In Race and Mixed Race The Kinship Schema, Naomi Zack attempts to explain why a person is considered black or white: “If a person has a black parent, a black grandparent, or a black greatn -grandparent (where n represents any number of past generations), then that person is designated black. But if a person has a white parent, or three white grandparents, or Z white greatn -grandparents (where Z is any odd number and n still represents any number of past generations), then that person is not thereby designated white.” According to this definition, a person is white if no black ancestors exist, whereas one black person (or non-white person) in the line makes or person black, or at least not white anymore. This is a rather new development; Willard B. Gatewood writes that between 1850 and 1915, white America moved from overlooking “some blackness in a person” to classifying persons with “one iota of color” as black. Naomi Zack concludes thus that according to this Schema, since white is also defined in terms of blackness, American racial categories are interdependent: American racial categories are, since they thus do not give any positive definition of blackness, groundless and have no empirical foundation. She argues that racial designations refer to physical characteristics of individuals, which were for one inherited from their forebears but also inherent in people in a physical way. So if someone is being called “black” in common American usage, this does not only refer to the looks of the person defined but about the looks of all black people and how the person resembles them. What is perceived as typically black is what scientists now view as the mythology of race which is nowadays closely intertwined with the historical conditions under which the now- disproved scientific theories of race were formulated. W.E.B. Du Bois (who was aware of the lack of an empirical foundation in nature for the concept of race), suggested that the black race was a concept made up by white people. However, du Bois and other important writers in the black emancipatory tradition resist racism on the basis of their own acceptance of the concept of race. “ They argue that their educational, moral, social, legal, and economic deficits in comparison to whites are not physically inherited or necessarily acquired. But there is n sustained objection to ordinary racial designations within the tradition of black emancipation.” The Kinship Schema can also be witnessed in popular culture. Famous actresses who are considered as being black, therefore representing African American Culture, are often only partly black, proving the Kinship Schema. Pam Grier and Halle Berry are both considered as black actresses and connected in some ways as well to Black pride, but both are only partly black: Mia Mask writes in Divas on Screen (2009) that Grier served both as a phenomenon of consumption (consumed by audience-consumers), as well as a phenomenon of production (produced by industrial institutions like American International Pictures). Therefore, Grier was both an object of the gaze and a subject of narrative action in films, promoting the image of African American Women. This image was partly constructed by white people in addition that Grier was only partly black, in fact a mixture of American, Indian and African American heritage. Halle Berry is partly German, Irish, English and African American. Their careers show another side of post- blackness; if Obama and Winfrey show the post- blackness in their multi-linguality, Grier and Berry are signifiers of American Popular Culture and how black women are being perceived. =Eugene Robinson and the renaming of black classes= Eugene Robinson (journalist) renames the black classes by defining blackness through social classes. There is the Emergent class: African immigrants who are ascending on the social level by outperforming Asian students at the university level, for example. Then the Abandoned, or the underclass: blacks who are trapped by low income in neighborhoods and schools where it is impossible to project a decent future. The Mainstream: they may work in integrated settings but still lead socially all-black lives. The Transcendent: “a small but growing cohort with the kind of power, wealth, and influence that previous generations of African Americans could never have imagined.” Robinson hopes that the Transcendent class will provide leaders, like Du Bois´ Talented Tenth over a century ago. But Robinson's expectations contradict his own evidence: blacks do not feel race solidarity the way they did at one time. He cites a 2007 Pew poll that said 61 percent of blacks don't believe that the black poor and the black middle class share common values. Examples in American culture =Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey= Touré claims that to have “Black success”, multi-linguality is necessary: the ability to be able to switch between different ways of Blackness. Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey are prime examples for that, switching between different roles of Black identity. He claims that Blackness may be an important part of them, but that Blackness does not dominate their persona. Both are able to switch between different modes of being black, so that they “can trust and also be trusted by European-Americans” but at the same time be able to “display the many forms of blackness when the occasion demands”. =The word 'nigga'= Post-blackness cannot only be witnessed through individuals in culture, but also in its language. The word nigga and its cultural development is an example for this: The usage of the word Nigga nowadays shows additionally another side of post-blackness in American Society. The term is not only used in America, but by blacks globally, sometimes annoying white Americans. The word is not taboo if it is used by people within the Black Diaspora; its meaning is an expression of kinship between Black people, and derogatory if used by whites. Criticism =Orlando Patterson= Patterson concludes that the sole common experience for blacks in post-blackness is “nothing more” than shared experiences in everyday life: to live with and overcome “old-fashioned racism” and learning to live with the white gaze. He sees therefore a close resemblance to Alan Dershowitz's theory of “the Tsuris Theory of Jewish Survival”; in that he claims that American Jews are always in need of “external troubles and imagined enemies” to maintain their identity. =Darryl Pinckney= Pinckney states that although black people may be in the mainstream now, black history is not, the prime example being The Shooting of Trayvon Martin. Henry Louis Gates Jr. calls the recognition scene, when the young boy realizes that he is different, Trayvon Martin's moment of instruction. There he must have realized that “the white world sees black people as different, no matter how blacks feel inside—has a history, one that yanks everybody back a step”. Touré takes the more sensationalistic term for Gates´ moment of instruction the “nigger wake-up call”. Also, in his opinion, Touré represents “the anti-essentialist idea of blackness, a discourse of privilege, far from the race feeling that said if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us”. Pinckney reminds the reader that history is not so long ago after all, even if black people want to forget. Touré seems to leave out that racism is not for all blacks the same. He writes from the perspective of a privileged black person. =Michelle Alexander= In her book The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander writes about how the War on Drugs is today's extension of America's overseer-style management of black men. She claims that like Vagrancy Laws were a form of social control, today this happens in form of the War on Drugs, which target minorities. =Randall Kennedy= Kennedy agrees with Touré's idea that no black should feel excluded due to issues of “blackness authenticity”. He disagrees however with the point that it is always wrong for blacks to question the “fidelity to black America” of other blacks. He adds that Stephen L. Carter wrote in Confessions of an Affirmative Action Baby that \\"loving our people and loving our culture does not require any restriction on what black people can think or say or do or be ... \\" When Touré refers to “our commonality” it is thus not clear what he means; if all can be black, then it is open what exactly this commonality includes. Kennedy states that boundaries and discipline are always fundamental aspects of a community; therefore Touré and his allies are trying to escape what basically defines a community. If there are no boundaries, there is no community. He too criticizes Touré for the perspective he is writing from: he himself is a “preppy talking, privileged black man”. Touré also voices an instrumental patriotism when he refers to the black man's “American-ness”. Kennedy thinks that a person can be indeed de-blacked (a term coined by Washington University Professor Kimberly Jade Norwood), and that a person who pursues a course of conduct that convincingly demonstrates the absence of even a minimal communal allegiance, should be rightly excluded. Another point is racial authenticity: although Kennedy agrees that whether black people are skiing or not is not the point of authenticity, he disagrees with Touré that everything is authentic: one should differentiate between specious and defensible notions of racial authenticity; out of frustration with the former, Touré throws out the latter. =Abdul Ali= Ali wrote in The Washington Independent Review of Books that Touré is writing like he himself has unresolved issues with his own blackness, rather than dealing with Black identity from a neutral point of view. He verifies this thesis by pointing at the 105 people who were interviewed by Touré to give a definition on blackness: all are either celebrities or upper class, lacking any “normal persons” like workers, immigrants or such, therefore lacking any diversity. Furthermore, he stresses the point that Touré writes about not having ever had a “typical black experience”, like his father did. This statement combined with the lack of “ordinary people” in his interviews makes Ali conclude that Touré ´s lack of perspective from “ordinary” black folks in this work” raises the question of whether the author is pandering to the white gaze by showing an über-sophisticated list of interview subjects, and not black people in our diversity”. The critic concludes that Touré has no real idea what Blackness is and that “we’re not post-black: just as we’re not post-American”. =Ben Daité= Daité writes in ‘Post-Blackness’ Within A Racial America? Relations To Black Cinema that no authentic black person would talk about or try to define blackness. Persons like Touré or Henry Louis Gates are struggling with their own identities, “constantly plugging our ears with the, ‘we are black too!’”. The critic acknowledges that the margins of slavery have been more clearly defined in the times of slavery than now, but that according to Malcolm X this is only evidence of the dilution he warned of. If Touré argues that there is no post.racial America, then Daité concludes, a post-blackness is not even possible. Touré is writing from a privileged point of view, disregarding the Color Line. Competing and comparable theses Post-blackness stresses the point that there are many different ways of defining what black is, but that they are all right. There are also some ideas not about how the borders of blackness blur, but that the borders of all races start to blur in a way in which post-blackness would not be an issue anymore: =Melissa V. Harris-Perry's Sister Citizen= Melissa Harris-Perry, a political science professor at Tulane University, deals with the unique experiences of African American women. Black women have been constrained throughout history by three stereotypes: the nurturing mammy, the lascivious Jezebel and the stiff-necked, unyielding matriarch. These archetypes are according to her additional obstacles compared to black men. “Strong is the default category for describing black women,” she writes. “But the myth leaves them sicker, less satisfied and more burdened than any other group.” According to her African American women are being “misrecognized” by society and by themselves; blackness in America is marked by shame that makes blacks view themselves as malignant. As a result, to escape that shame, black women are often politically involved. For example, in a literary way like Zora Neale Hurston or Ntozake Shange. In her opinion it is not only white people responsible for this; a lot of responsibility lies in the black community itself, through black liberation theology's silence on gender or the gender inequality in Christian churches in general; women's achievements in the civil rights movement have not been acknowledged enough or sometimes not at all. Most of the limitations today have not been placed by white people, but by the expectations of black women (or people in general) on themselves. =\\"The Declining Significance of Race\\" by Wilson= \\"The Declining Significance of Race\\" is an article by William Julius Wilson, (reprinted from Society Jan./Feb. 1978) written in 1978. In this article he stresses that the economic sphere, class has become more important than race. He acknowledges that the traditional forms of racial segregation and discrimination still exist in contemporary America and that when the article was written blacks still were not welcomed into some private institutions and social arrangements like residential areas or private social clubs. Therefore, the black underclass still had the same problems, but privileged blacks came into a zone were the rules of economy were stronger than the rules of class. Wilson therefore defines three stages of American class relations to explain how this was made possible. In those three stages the relationship of whites and blacks in America changed due to historical, political and economical events: The three stages of American class relations in short: # The Preindustrial Stage: This is the period of plantation economy and racial-caste oppression; it coincides with antebellum slavery and the early postbellum era. # The Industrial Stage: This is the period of industrial expansion, class conflict, and racial oppression. It begins in the last quarter of the 19th century and lasts roughly until the New Deal Era. # The Modern Industrial Stage: This is the period of progressive transition from race inequalities to class inequalities. It lasts during the modern, industrial, post–World War II era and really begins to crystallize during the 1960s and 1970s. Criticism: According to Darryl Pinckney, this thesis that in the modern industrial system the economic position had much more influence on a black person's life than his race was not well received by black critics: it failed to address institutional racism and systemic inequality. The season of extreme black rhetoric may have coincided with the doubling of the size of white middle class, because of new laws mandating equal employment. Still in order to be considered middle class, black families needed two incomes compared to whites with one. Black women could enter white-collar jobs like secretarial and clerical work, since they were also jobs exclusively for women. A black man, to earn a comparable income to a white man, needed more education and needed also to be in a higher occupation than a white man.

He worked in English public libraries at the turn of, and the early, twentieth century, and was prominent among opponents of open access libraries in the UK. Life and career Goss was born in Denmark Hill, in South London, in 1864. He worked in Birkenhead and Newcastle public libraries, before becoming the first librarian in Lewisham (beating 300 other applicants to the post). He was forced out of this post, and left to become the librarian at the Bishopsgate Institute until he retired. While there, he campaigned to raise the status and pay of library staff. He retired in 1941, and died five years later. Whilst there, he established some of their special collections in London history, labour history, freethought and humanism. Open Access Controversy Goss was a vocal opponent of the move to open access libraries (as opposed to closed access, where staff would fetch titles requested by readers, from the stacks) In 1898 he obtained an apology from James Duff Brown in the course of their heated debate in the pages of the library press after threatening him with a libel action. Duff Brown had been at the forefront of introducing open access. Descriptive cataloguing Goss preferred the printed dictionary catalogue to the card catalogue. He further attempted to improve the usefulness of catalogues as a search tool, by adding a short description, close to what would now be considered an abstract of the text. This extra description of books was intended to complement and assist in closed access collections. One such catalogue he produced was A Descriptive Bibliography of the Writings of George Jacob Holyoake for the Bishopsgate library.

The River Derwent flows nearby. Land in the area formerly belonged to Rievaulx Abbey and Foulbridge Preceptory was located here. In medieval times the manor belonged to the Templars, before John de Dalton took over ownership in 1308. History In 1177–81 and 1189–90, Foulbridge was a member of Settrington, but it afterwards passed into the overlordship of the Percys, Earls of Northumberland, and of the Mowbrays. John, Lord Mowbray died seised of the moiety of the manor, which must have escheated to him, in 1322, and in 1327 the demesne lands were said to have lain fallow since the Conquest. Foulbridge was probably the \\"manor of Snainton\\" about which Ingram de Boynton and the Knights of the Temple made an agreement before 1226. John de Knapton also granted to that order rent and services in Snainton in the spring of 1240–1. In 1273 the knights held the manor and the \\"empty windmill\\" of Foulbridge, and in 1307 the manor, windmill and 260 acres in \\"waynage\\". The Templars remained in power at Foulbridge until John de Dalton took over ownership in 1308. A claim was made by the Earl of Lancaster in 1334 that on the suppression of this order the manor had escheated to him, the liberties of the Templars having become extinguished. Judgement, however, was given for the Hospitallers, to whom Edward II had confirmed the Templars' lands in 1324. On the ground that he was diverting its revenues from the hospital, the custody of the manor was ordered to be taken from Thomas Salkeld in 1359 and given to English members of the order. Bridge over the River Derwent at Foulbridge Sir Ralph Eure's 'place' here is mentioned in 1537, and the manor, late the possession of the Hospitallers and in the tenure of Sir Ralph Eure, was in 1555–6 granted to the Archbishop of York, but no later mention of it has been found. The Templars were said in 1273 and 1307 to give alms to every pauper who came, for three days weekly, whether by right or charity the jurors did not know. In 1334 the bridge and road of Pul within the forest, which were highways for \\"carriages, carts, drifts and packsaddles\\", were in decay and broken. It was proved that the repair of the bridge with the road to the east was incumbent on the Hospitallers by reason of their tenements at Foulbridge; the road to the west was reparable by the nuns of Yedingham.

He represented his native Belarus in three editions of the Olympic Games (2008, 2012 and 2016), and has won a total of seven bronze medals in major international competition, in both the long and short course European Championships. Career =Early years= Sankovich made his first Belarusian team, as an 18-year-old, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, competing in both the 100 m backstroke and the medley relay. Leading up to the Games, he broke a Belarusian record and cleared a FINA B-cut of 56.10 at the Belarusian National Championships in Minsk. In the 100 m backstroke, Sankovich came second in his heat behind Colombia's Omar Pinzón by 0.28 of a second with 55.39 seconds, but failed to advance to the semifinals, finishing twenty-ninth out of 45 entrants in the prelims. Few days later, he joined with Yauheni Lazuka, Viktar Vabishchevich, and two-time Olympian Stanislau Neviarouski for the men's 4 × 100 m medley relay. Swimming the backstroke leg, Sankovich recorded a time of 55.11 seconds, and the Belarusian team went on to finish the heats in sixteenth place, for a total time of 3:39.39. Four years after competing in his last Olympics, Sankovich qualified for his second Belarusian team, as a 22-year- old, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, by eclipsing a FINA B-standard entry time of 54.56 in the men's 100 m backstroke. He was third heat of his 100 m backstroke, and won it with a new Belarusian record of 54.53, but narrowly missed a spot in the semifinals by one hundredth of a second (0.01) behind Olympic veteran Aristeidis Grigoriadis, placing eighteenth out of 43 swimmers in the prelims. In the 100 m butterfly, Sankovich finished the race in thirty-fourth overall by seven hundredths of a second (0.07) behind Switzerland's Dominik Meichtry with 53.47. =Post-London era= In January 2013, Sankovich attended the Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, where he majored in social science. While swimming for the Florida State Seminoles under head coach Frank Bradley, Sankovich had obtained a total of five individual event All-America honors at the NCAA Championships, and set five university records for two consecutive seasons in the 100 m backstroke, 100 m butterfly, and 200 m individual medley. Sankovich showed a tremendous improvement on the international scene at the 2014 European Championships in Berlin, Germany, overhauling the 52-second barrier in the 100 m butterfly to produce his own lifetime best (51.92) and collect his first ever bronze medal of the meet. The 2015 season brought a stellar feat for Sankovich, as he swam a career best and the world's third fastest time (51.57) in the 100 m butterfly at the Belarus Open, but could not beat his rival Yauhen Tsurkin, who was faster by 0.13 of a second, lowering the Belarusian record. At the 2016 Olympics, he took part in the 100 m butterfly, finishing in 28th place.

Miguel Buiza was commander of this Republican Navy ship when he became Captain General of the Spanish Republican Fleet. Cruiser Miguel de Cervantes, the ship on which Miguel Buiza left Cartagena for Bizerte leading the remnant of the Spanish Republican Armada in March 1939. Miguel Buiza Fernández-Palacios (1898 - 1963) was a Spanish Navy officer best known for being the commander of the Spanish Republican Navy during the Spanish Civil War. He died in exile in Marseille in 1963.Sevillanos ilustres Miguel Buiza is often referred to as an admiral, owing to his high-profile role leading the Spanish Republican Armada, but there are sources that claim that he never rose above the rank of captain (Capitán de Navío)Javier García Fernández (coord.), 25 militares de la República; \\"El Ejército Popular de la República y sus mandos profesionales\\", Ed. Ministerio de Defensa, Madrid 2011 Early life Miguel Buiza was born in a wealthy family of factory owners in Seville. In 1915, Buiza entered the Naval Academy at San Fernando. By 1932, he had reached the rank of lieutenant commander () of the Spanish Republican Navy. Four years later, when the Spanish Civil War started, he was in command of the military tugboat Cíclope (RA-1)Remolcador de Altura Cíclope, RA-1 and refused to join the July 1936 pro-Fascist coup, remaining loyal to the republic. His brother Francisco, a commander of the Spanish Republican Army, joined the rebel faction after the coup and was killed in action in the front near Madrid early in the Civil War.  Civil war  In early August 1936, at the beginning of the war, Miguel Buiza took part in the blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar as commander of the light cruiser Libertad. Later in the same month, he saw action in the Battle of Majorca in support of the failed Republican landing operation at Porto Cristo. On 2 September, Miguel Buiza was named Captain General of the republican fleet by Indalecio Prieto, the Navy and Air Minister (Ministro de Marina y Aire), while keeping the command of the Libertad.Almirante Buiza, Forum \\"El Gran capitán\\" Buiza was only 38 years old at the time. In the dire 1936 post-coup reorganization of the Spanish Republican Armed Forces, Prieto did away with the Navy 'ship committees' and sought to create a structure that would reimpose discipline after the bulk of the top commanders had defected to the rebels. Following the disappointing defeat of the Spanish Republican fleet on 27 September 1938 at the Battle of Cape Cherchell, when a series of tactical mistakes on the part of the Republican command resulted in the loss of two cargo ships, Miguel Buiza was relieved of his duties as commander of the Navy and replaced by Captain Luis González de Ubieta who was promoted to admiral. President Manuel Azaña acknowledged in his memoirs his disappointment in the indecisiveness of the commander of the Spanish Republican Navy, despite having a greater number of ships.Manuel Azaña, Diarios de Azaña, Vol. IV, p. 620 After being demoted, Buiza was transferred from one post to another, such as Inspector of naval bases, Chief of staff of the NavyDiario Oficial de la República, núm. 860, 26 de diciembre de 1937 and then also secondary posts such as naval personnel director, until he was reinstated to Captain General of the Republican Armada in February 1939.Diario oficial de la República, núm. 22, 22 de enero de 1939 Shortly thereafter, on 5 March 1939, Spanish Republican Army Colonel Segismundo Casado launched an anticommunist coup and proclaimed a National Defence Council (Consejo Nacional de Defensa) in order to seek an armistice with the rebels and end the fratricidal war, a measure that Miguel Buiza favored. On the same day, the Nationalist Air Force bombed the harbour of Cartagena, the main base of the Republican Navy, sinking the destroyer Sanchez Barcaiztegui.Juliá, Santos; Casanova, Julían; Solé i Sabaté, Josep Maria, Villarroya, Joan; and Moreno, Francisco.

As soon as night fell, at least three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left Cartagena harbor, speeding for the high seas. The fleet took an eastward course, led by Miguel Buiza abord the cruiser Miguel de Cervantes, and reached Algerian waters. Off Oran, Buiza asked for permission to anchor, but the naval authorities of French Algeria would not allow him to lead the Spanish Republican ships into their harbor. They directed him to Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia, where the fleet arrived on 7 March. Not long after anchoring, the fleet was impounded by the French authorities.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2001. London. p.877 Except for a few crewmen who were put on guard duty on the ships, the Spanish Republican seamen and their officers were interned in a concentration camp at Meheri Zabbens, near Meknassy, in an abandoned phosphate mine.

Los Republicanos Españoles en la Legion Extrangera Francesa, Ed. Bruguera, Barcelona 1972. At the beginning of World War II, Buiza had been promoted to commander, but in mid 1940, he resigned following the Second Armistice at Compiègne between Nazi Germany and the Third French Republic. Certain sources claim though that he was forced out of the French Foreign Legion by the new authorities of Vichy France because of his antifascist past.Joaquín Mañes Postigo, Españoles en la Legión Extranjera francesa, Col.

Unusually for a quarterback, Puleri played ironman in arena football, seeing limited playing time on defense and special teams.

Puleri would be the starting quarterback in the XFL's first game, leading the Hitmen against the Las Vegas Outlaws on national television. Puleri's tenure as the Hitmen's starting quarterback proved to be a disastrous embarrassment for both him and the league as a whole, as he was repeatedly sacked and turned the ball over numerous times, making the league's level of talent look bad and partially prompting the mass decline in viewers as the season progressed. After a short quarterback controversy, Puleri was benched in favor of Wally Richardson (a former NFL backup for the Baltimore Ravens and Atlanta Falcons) during the second week of the season.

In July 2012, Agha Waqar Ahmed's Water-kit was publicly announced as an apparatus that allows water to be used as a source of fuel in cars. The apparatus consists of a \\"water-kit\\" that can break water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules through the process of electrolysis of water. Ahmed claims that any car using his kit can run exclusively on water and will yield of travel on a liter of water. He has also claimed that his technology can power the entire country with water. His claims have been met with scepticism as well as enthusiasm from Pakistani scientists. Critics have pointed out that in order for the invention to work, it would have to violate the second law of thermodynamics. Water kit Ahmed calls his invention \\"water-kit\\". The kit consists of a cylindrical jar (which holds the water), electrodes, wires to be attached with car's battery and a hose leading to the engine. The kit claims to use electrolysis to convert water into HHO gas, which is then used as fuel in an otherwise unmodified gasoline engine. The kit states that it requires distilled water. Ahmed claims that he has been able to achieve much higher amounts of HHO compared to any other inventor because of his \\"undisclosed calculations\\". He has applied for a patent from the Government of Pakistan and is waiting for their feedback. Government response Ahmed claims to have done several demonstrations for Pakistani government officials. According to a television interview he has had three meetings with Government's Science and Technology sector as well as a meeting with Pakistan's Atomic energy commission. Upon hearing about his invention, the prime minister of Pakistan, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, formed a committee consisting of three people. The committee members were Khursheed Shah, the minister of religious affairs, Mir Changez Khan Jamali, the federal minister for Science and Technology, and Dr. Asim Hussain, the advisor to the Prime Minister on Petroleum and Natural Resources. Out of the three members, Khursheed Shah has publicly supported Ahmed's invention. After much publicity and media coverage, many government officials came forward to offer support for Ahmed's invention. Along with the aforementioned federal minister for Religious Affairs, two other federal ministers endorsed his work. Sindh Minister for Law and Prisons, Mohammad Ayaz Soomro, called Ahmed a national hero while speaking to a media group. Three other government officials congratulated him, stating that he \\"brought a revolution in the world of Science\\". However, Ahmed has been criticised for not clearly explaining how his invention could work without violating the laws of thermodynamics. Ahmed was invited by Jamil Ahmed Khan, the Pakistani ambassador to UAE, to demonstrate his technology in Abu Dhabi. Abdul Qadeer Khan, a nuclear scientist, has supported the idea of a water-fuelled car; however he has been criticised for his position. Samar Mubarakmand was supportive of this idea and seemed enthusiastic at first, but when Agha Waqar was called by Pakistan Television Corporation to take the demo of this Water Kit, he failed to give a demonstration in the live program in his car, claiming he had not fit the Water kit in his car for the TV program. Mubarakmand then told him that in his opinion, calcium carbide is added in water to produce the fuel for the engine. In that case, the calcium carbide is the energy source, not the water. Criticism Atta ur Rahman, a scientist and a former minister of Science and Technology, called for a technical investigation of Ahmed's car by top engineering universities when he appeared on Geo TV's Capital Talk. He told the host, Hamid Mir, that such inventions don't work and if they were to work, they would violate the law of conservation of energy. Ahmed replied to this criticism by stating that he had already made long drives with the car, done demonstrations for politicians and media personalities. He even challenged Rahman to check and verify his water fueled car himself. By the end of the show, everyone agreed that the car should be tested by independent sources. Rahman showed similar concerns in another show by Talat Hussain Syed, News Night with Talat, for Dawn News. While speaking to Express Tribune, Rahman stated he suspected this invention to be a scam. He repeated that such an invention would have to violate the laws of thermodynamics to work. On 11 August 2012, Rahman reported that the vehicle was to be fully inspected by engineers at the National University of Science & Technology, but Ahmed never showed up for the appointment. This caused Rehman to further accuse Ahmed of fraud, stating \\"Agha Waqar Ahmad did a disappearing act and never turned up for the appointment. The fraud had been exposed and escape was the only route available to him\\". Pervez Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist, wrote in The Express Tribune that Ahmed's coverage in the media, along with endorsement by government authorities and scientists, has exposed the ignorance and self-delusion of such entities. He criticized politicians and media for hailing Ahmed as a national hero and for promoting pseudo-scientific theories related to water-fueled cars. He insisted any technology should comply with basic principles of Science before getting any government funding. It is worth mentioning that before Agha Waqar Ahmed, another Pakistani known as Doctor Ghulam Sarwar had claimed in December 2011 that he had invented a car that only runs on water. Several other skeptics have also weighed in on Ahmed's invention, mainly due to its violation of second law of thermodynamics. On 6 August 2012, a physics teacher, Ranomal Malani, challenged Ahmed to demonstrate his kit publicly. If he succeeds, Malani has promised a pay out of five million rupees. Ahmed accepted the challenge. Talat Hussain, who covered Ahmed's invention on his show, did a follow up show on 3 August 2012 to address the skeptics. His guests consisted of a panel of scientists, a Ph.D student and a reporter for KTN News. Ahmed was notable by his absence. The scientists reiterated the problem of water- kit's incompatibility with the second law of thermodynamics. One of the guests, Javed Ahmed Chatta, said he was present at one of the demonstrations and showed his skepticism; however, his concerns were ignored by the authorities. Another guest, Adeel Ghayur, stated that even if the apparent violation of natural laws was ignored the cost to operate such a car would be impractical.

Biography =Early days= Roland Stobbart was born at Aspatria, Cumberland, England in 1909; the eldest of two sons to an haulage contractor. Even before he reached maturity one Cumberland newspaper was describing him as, \\"probably the finest racing motorcyclist in Cumberland. A clever, daring rider who does not know the meaning of the word fear.\\" He was at that time attached to the Workington Motor Cycling Club. By the age of twenty he had met with considerable success on Dirt tracks and Grasstracks throughout the north of England and had successfully taken part in sand races in Scotland. When they introduced grass track racing at Whitehaven he became the principal prize-winner. In 1930 he entered the senior Manx Grand Prix on the Isle of Man, formerly known as the Manx Amateur Motorcycle Road Race. Although he buckled his front wheel half-a-mile from the start he continued the race and the distance of over 200 miles with a soft tyre and a badly bent wheel. His average speed was 64.7 miles per hour, and he did the fastest lap at 68 miles per hour.West Cumberland Times, 27 September 1930 Stobbart entered the race in the following two years but despite doing good times in the practice laps he failed to complete either of the races. In 1932 he retired after the first lap when he suffered a puncture. =Workington= The first motor cycle cinder track race at Workington took place at Lonsdale Park on 15 August 1931. The event promoted by the Workington Motor Cycle Club was the brainchild of Roland Stobbart. A total of 32 competitors from all over the North of England, including future world finalist Bill Kitchen, took part in a series of 'scratch' and 'handicap' events in a 21-race programme and attracted over 2,000 spectators. Both Roland and his younger brother Maurice both competed, and although Sheffield rider, George Mortimer, won both events Roland set the course record and beat him in the Cumberland versus Yorkshire match. The winner of the 'scratch' event received the princely sum of £5, while second and third received £3 and £1-10 shillings (£1.50p) respectively. Meanwhile, the winner of the 'handicap' event picked up £4, with the second and third placed riders collecting £2 and £1-10 shillings (£1.50p) each.West Cumberland Times, 19 August 1931 Notwithstanding the size of the crowd this inaugural meeting was a financial disaster and in consequence no more meetings took place that year. However the banked, narrow circuit, at 439 yards per lap had provided fast and exciting racing despite its narrow width restricting races to only three riders.Cumberland News & Star, 21 April 2011 In 1932 the 'Border Sports Club' promoted a total of eight meetings, held at fortnightly intervals, and attracted crowds averaging 3,000 for each meeting. On 28 June, Roland, who often raced with a cigarette between his lips, broadsided, skidded and wobbled four times round the rain soaked track at 45 miles per hour to set a new one mile record for the Workington track of 1 min 19.2 seconds, two seconds short of the then British record.West Cumberland Times, 1 June 1932 At these events Stobbart won both the Golden Sash.West Cumberland Times, 15 June 1932 and the Golden Helmet.West Cumberland Times, 29 June 1932 Newcastle Diamonds Speedway Team =National Speedway= Roland began his English national Speedway career riding for Leeds Lions during the 1931 season, while simultaneously riding at Workington. In 1932, after a short spell with Preston he moved to West Ham, London, after the Lancashire club folded. He remained with the ‘Hammers’ until he moved to Provincial league Bristol in 1937. In 1938 he rode for the Newcastle Diamonds, where he remained until World War II disrupted his career.West Cumberland Times, 15 May 1938 In the 1939 season he was a sensation. He bought a motorcycle from Arthur Atkinson for £15 and then proceeded to score 16 out of 18 points at Newcastle, 8 out of 9 points at Edinburgh, 9 out of 12 at Sheffield, and 10 out of 12 at Hackney, London. During the 1948 season he came out of retirement to act as Newcastle second reserve. =International honours= On 1 November 1935, Roland left Aspatria to sail for Australia as a member of the England team chosen to ride in the test matches that winter. He was accompanied by Arthur Atkinson, Harold Tiger Stevenson, Joe Abbott, Dusty Haigh and Jack Parker.West Cumberland Times 2 November 1935 He was selected again in season 1939 when he rode for England against the Dominions. =Promoter and manager= Bill Desmond, Sam Marsland, Roland Stobbart, Maurice Stobbart & A# S# Rosenfeld In 1937, Roland broke his arm while riding for West Ham and as a consequence took no further part in that year's campaign. Instead he became manager of Workington, a position he retained in 1938; introducing riders of the calibre of George Greenwood, George Pepper, Charlie Spinks and Norman Hargreaves.Hoare (1979), p.30 He also promoted Speedway at Dam Park, Ayr in 1937, and Carlisle in the same year. In 1933 Rol became a minor celebrity, appearing as a stuntman in a film entitled Money for Speed, starring Ida Lupino and John Lauder.

(from Middle High German liele) + pargəl 'little mountain'. The names thus refer to the local vegetation. The standard German name Gutenberg (literally, 'good mountain') may simply be an optimistic name expressing wishes for a good harvest. History Srobotnik was a Gottschee German village. The settlement was not mentioned in the land registry of 1574 or the census of 1770, and so it was probably a more recent settlement. In 1931 it had 10 houses and a population of 31. The inhabitants were evicted in the fall of 1941. During the Rog Offensive in the summer of 1942, Italian forces burned the village and it was never rebuilt.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971.

History  In 1945, after the Second World War, shipping by private shipowners initially picked up again on a moderate scale under the direction of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Binnenschiffahrt Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts with its head office in Berlin. On 27 October 1949 the state-owned firm of Deutsche Schiffahrts- und Umschlagsbetriebs-Zentrale (DSU) was established with its main branch in Stralsund. All the freight and passenger transport on the inland waterways of East Germany was transferred to this company. Founded on 1 January 1957, the VEB passenger shipping company in Stralsund, Weiße Flotte, with its head office in Stralsund took over the overwhelming majority of excursion and scheduled services along the entire Baltic Sea coast. This company initially had just eleven staff and another 17 employees as well as 10 motor vessels, with a total seating of 1,511, in its first year of operations. Over the years, branches were set up along the Baltic coast, the ships were modernized and the number of staff increased. Amongst the services operated at that time were excursions were to Gedser, Fehmarn and Møn, round trips around Rügen and Hiddensee, ocean crossings and harbour cruises. After extensive renovations to the ships of the \\"White Fleet\\" in 1958/59 and the addition of a ferry service to Altefähr, e.g. with the Stralsunder, the number of ships at the beginning of 1959 increased to 17 vessels with a total of 2,488 seats. Three years later, the fleet of passenger ships rose to 23 through the acquisition of the Genossenschaftsreederei Hiddensee of Vitte. Now a total of 3,251 seats were available. In 1961 two hydrofoils, the TF 10-1 and TF 10-2 joined the Weiße Flotte from Roßlau, and were assigned to services between Warnemünde and Rostock-Kabutzenhof. By the end of 1963, the Weiße Flotte employed 36 passenger ships with 4,740 seats and two freighters were employed on a total of 44 scheduled services. In 1974, the Weiße Flotte was further modernized with the purchase of three hydrofoils of the Kometa-M type. The boats, which had been built in the Soviet Union at the shipyard of Poti (Grusinische SSR), were selected for fast services on the Stralsund - Sassnitz - Szczecin or Rostock - Wismar lines. With a speed of 32 knots (60 km/h), these boats needed only about four hours, for example, for the route from Stralsund via Sassnitz to Swinoujscie and were thus much faster than the cruise liners. With a fleet of three hydrofoils, 31 passenger ships, seven ferries, two freighters and a ferry unit (Fährschubeinheit) for heavy goods vehicles, the Weiße Flotte transported 4.7 million passengers on 85 routes in 1989. In 1990 the Weiße Flotte was privatized and taken over by the shipping association of Förde Reederei Seetouristik from Flensburg. The traditional name of Weiße Flotte remained unchanged. All the old ships were sold and replaced with new, more modern and more comfortable ships. The president of the district council of Rügen, Gesine Skrepski, opened a new jetty for the Wittow Ferry in 1994. In 1995, the Reederei Hiddensee, a subsidiary of the Weiße Flotte, was founded. The Reederei Hiddensee operates all the regular services from Zingst, Wiek, Stralsund and Schaprode to the island of Hiddensee. Through the establishment of Reederei Hiddensee the area of operations of the Weiße Flotte expanded to include ferry services (Glewitz - Stahlbrode, Warnemünde - Hohe Düne, Wittow Nord - Wittow-Süd) and excursions on the Baltic Sea.  Ships/routes  The Weiße Flotte runs several car and passenger ferries along the Baltic Sea coast of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. = Car ferries = * Car ferry: Warnemünde - Hohe Düne : The two ferries, the Breitling and the Warnow, that shuttle between the Baltic Sea resort of Warnemünde and the village of Hohe Düne, were built in 1994 and 1995 at the Oderwerft Eisenhüttenstadt shipyard on the Oder. The technical data for the 2 ships are identical. They have a length of 38 metres and a beam of 11.60 metres. They can seat 150 passengers and carry 25 cars. The engines generate 3 x 186 kW, and the boats can travel at up to 7.5 knots. *Car ferry: Stahlbrode - Glewitz : Three car ferries ply the route between Stahlbrode and Glewitz (Bay of Greifswald), the Glewitz, the Stahlbrode and the Stralsund. The Glewitz and Stahlbrode were built in 1965 at the Varvet shipyard in Sweden. They have a length of 58.30 m and a width of 12.20 m, and can carry 300 passengers and 45 cars. With an engine power of 3 x 110 kW, they can reach a speed of 7 knots. The Stralsund, also built on the Varvet yard in 1963, is 41 metres long and 11.40 metres wide. It has room for 50 passengers and 30 vehicles. The two engines each have a capacity of 144 kW. The ship can reach a speed of 7 knots *Car ferry: Wittow Nord - Wittow Süd : The route to Rügen, known as the Wittow Ferry, is worked by a ferry called the Wittow. The ferry was built in 1996 on the Oder shipyard of Eisenhüttenstadt. It has a length of 38 metres and a width of 12 metres and can carry 150 passengers and 45 cars. The engines produce a power of 3 x 186 kW, so the ferry can attain a speed of 7.5 knots. = Passenger ferries = *Passenger ferry: Stralsund - Altefähr : The passenger ferry Altefähr was built in 1996 at the shipyard of WBG Berlin. It has a length of 21.50 m and a width of 5.50 m and can seat 225 passengers. With an engine output of 187 kW the ferry can attain a speed of 11 knots. : The ferry offers harbour cruises in Stralsund.

Under shared Israeli-Palestinian leadership, IPCRI carries out research and projects in various fields from economic development to environmental sustainability. IPCRI also facilitates public outreach and track two negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.  Mission  The Israel/ Palestine Center for Research and Information is a joint institution of Israelis and Palestinians dedicated to a just, viable and sustainable resolution of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict on the basis of “two states for two peoples.\\" Author Michelle I. Gawerc noted IPCRI importance as one of the only organizations to be active during the Second Intifada.  History  In 1988, as a response to the first few months of the First Intifada, Gershon Baskin published an advertisement in three Palestinian newspapers inviting Palestinians who believed in a two-state solution to contact him. He met with 23 interested Palestinians and laid the foundation for IPCRI, which was known at the time as the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information. This organization operated as a public policy think tank in search of a two-state solution based on self-determination and security for both Palestinians and Israelis. Integral in the structure of the new organization was joint management by two directors—one Israeli, one Palestinian—as well as an equally divided board of directors. The fledgling organization worked for over a year to garner support and partnership from prominent Israeli and Palestinian politicians to ensure its survival and effectiveness. A Palestinian co-director, Zakaria al Qaq was appointed in accordance with the declared policy of IPCRI of sharing management of the organization between Israelis and Palestinians. After this phase, IPCRI began its work by establishing working groups on business and economics, water, and the issue of Jerusalem. Participants included officials from both communities, economists, scientists, NGO representatives and journalists. Reports arising from these meetings played an important role in informing key Israeli and Palestinian deliberations and negotiations over the years. In response to the favorable atmosphere created by the Oslo I Accord, IPCRI expanded its activities and became involved in peace education, putting forward proposals for the creation of legal frameworks dealing with investment and other economic issues, and environmental concerns. IPCRI sought both to provide a safe environment in which Israelis and Palestinians could share their concerns and influence public policy. The coming of the Second Intifada in 2000 made the work of IPCRI more difficult but activity continued in almost all of the areas of concern mentioned above. IPCRI developed wide ranging contacts within Israeli and Palestinian society and continued to attract funding from the international community.Baskin, Gershon and Zakaria al Qaq: \\"The History of IPCRI and Applied Lessons to Be Learned from a Joint Share Holder Institute\\", February 2000 After more than a decade of standstill, IPCRI decided to focus In developing trans boundary partnerships and \\"Out of the Box\\" initiatives. Accordingly, in 2013 the organization announced its new name in order for supporting Creative Regional Initiatives for confronting the conflict. IPCRI founder Gershon Baskin served as the Israeli Co-CEO of IPCRI from its establishment in 1988 through the end of 2011. The Palestinian Co- CEOs were Zakaria al Qaq, Khaled Duzdar, and Hanna Siniora. Since 2012, IPCRI was co-managed by Israeli Dan Goldenblatt and Palestinian Riman Barakat from their offices in Jerusalem. Since January 2016, Liel Maghen and Nivine Sandouka serve as the co-directors of the organization.  Areas of Work  = Environment = The Environment and Water Department at IPCRI was established in 1994. It has as its objective the promotion of effective cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians regarding the environmental future of the region. Over the years it has been concerned, among other issues, with conflicts over water and the promotion of low cost sanitation projects, the introduction of solar energy into the region, the vexed question of the treatment of hazardous waste, the study of air pollution and the long- term impact of climate change. Earlier initiatives included the training of Israelis and Palestinians in the specialized field of environmental mediation. The program has been financed largely by the international community. Donors have included United States Agency for International Development, the European Union, the Canadian aid agency International Development Research Centre, as well as a variety of national governments. Over the years several thousand Israelis and Palestinians have taken part in the program together with many diverse international experts. GLOWA IPCRI has been an active partner in the “GLOWA Jordan River Project”. This is an international study of the future of the water scarce Jordan River Basin financed by the German Ministry of Education and Research. Research teams from Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and Germany took part. The project began a decade ago and IPCRI joined it in 2006. Its role was to promote genuine cooperation among the partners and to help prepare alternative scenarios as to what response to the impact of climate change should be in different political and economic circumstances Water Conferences In 2004 IPCRI organized a major conference on water issues in the Middle East which was attended by over 200 Palestinian, Israeli, Jordanian, Turkish and various international experts and officials and held in Antalya, Turkey. The published results of the conference have become a standard text for those working on water issues in the region and the inter-personal relationships developed both at this conference and at other IPCRI seminars on water distribution and quality, have done much to promote effective dialogue between the two communities. The papers presented were published by Springer Verlag, in Germany in 2006. IPCRI undertook work on providing low cost sanitation to Palestinian villages in the West Bank with the support of the Japanese Government in 2009. =Political Think Tank and Track II Negotiations=  Strategic Thinking and Analysis Team (STAT)  Every month a team of Palestinian and Israeli academic, political, and economic leaders come together for a think tank session about a specific aspect of the advancement of a just and sustainable solution to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. Subsequently, IPCRI publishes policy papers with the meetings' findings. Recently, experts have engaged in conversation on such topics as normalization, the status quo in the peace process, and collective rights in Israel and Palestine. From these discussions, the experts produce policy papers with their reflections and recommendations addressing the issues. These meetings are supported by the German foundation Konrad Adenauer Stiftung. Release of Gilad Shalit On 25 June 2006 Gilad Shalit, an Israeli IDF Soldier, was abducted by Hamas. Gershon Baskin had met a professor of the Islamic University of Gaza at a conference in Cairo. Through him he was able to establish contact with a Hamas operative, and then with Ghazi Hamad, Hamas´s deputy Foreign minister. Baskin offered the Olmert government help to negotiate a deal for the release of Gilad Shalit but was rejected. After David Meidan became the new representative in the negotiations to release Gilad Shalit under the Netanyahu government in April 2011, Baskin renewed his offer. Meidan rejected his offer for five years before agreeing. Baskin was able to establish a communication line through which he was able to negotiate with Ahmed Jabari, operational leader of Hamas´s military wing, and high on the list of terrorists wanted by Israel. =Peace Building= Peace Education Program From 1994 to 2005, IPCRI established a Peace Education curriculum to be taught to 10th graders in Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian schools. The original Peace Education curriculum was implemented in 32 schools, involving 3,000 students and 200 teachers—eventually the program grew to be implemented in 70 schools around the country. The project was developed jointly by Israelis and Palestinians and drew on subjects already taught in classrooms, such as sociology, history, and literature. IPCRI project coordinators collaborated with the Israeli Ministry of Education in an attempt to expand the program. IPCRI endeavored to implement this program in order to equip high school students, mature enough to deal with the difficult subject matter, with conflict resolution skills and the values of peace, respect, and human rights. The project also included a sophisticated training program for the Peace Education instructors, which qualified the teachers to coach students in conflict resolution and also allowed for teachers from each side of the conflict to meet and interact. In 2005, IPCRI was forced to discontinue the program due to budgetary restrictions, despite its success in bringing students and teachers from Israel and Palestine together, even during the Intifada. Israeli and Palestinian Women for Change This project, which spanned from May to December 2011, aimed to engage and empower Israeli and Palestinian women. It is supported by the Middle East Partnership Initiative. Mixed groups from across Israel and the West Bank came together first in small discussion groups to create a foundation of familiarity. The beginning of the project aimed to increase the women's self-confidence and organizational skills. The participants were also encouraged to find common ground by discussing such transcendent women's issues as childcare and pregnancy. In its second stage, Women for Change Now brought participants together for a weekend-long conference. Participants in this conference addressed Israeli- Palestinian conflict issues more directly by requiring groups of women to create their own peace-building projects and to collaborate to implement these initiatives. The projects created include a Hebrew-Arabic language workshop, a handicraft cooperative, a youth engagement initiative, and a cultural festival, among others. Visit Israel/Palestine IPCRI runs tours for Israelis and Palestinians in various cities across Israel and Palestine. IPCRI facilitates an exchange of information by obtaining travel permits for participants where travel is largely restricted. These trips have toured such destinations as Bethlehem and Jericho with the goal of breaking down physical and mental barriers, removing suspicion and fear of the other, and building up trust and support for a political peace process.  Partners for Change  IPCRI is bringing together 300 Jewish and Arab youths from Lod, Ramle and Tel Aviv-Jaffa (mixed Arab/Jewish cities). These young people work together to improve their cities after a process of reflection on their separate identities and the unique situation within their cities. They learn to understand the experiences and circumstances of the other side and subsequently collaborate to develop a hands-on community development project. The project aims to foster a sense of \\"shared citizenship, justice and equality\\". Through the development of a participatory community improvement program, the youth work together across the Israeli and Arab communities. Partners for Change is supported by the United States Agency for International Development. Research of Israeli and Palestinian Textbooks In 2004, the United States Consulate in Jerusalem commissioned IPCRI to investigate textbooks in Israeli and Palestinian schools to examine whether they are of a tolerant, peaceful nature or a belligerent and discriminatory towards the other side. According to IPCRI's published reports, Palestinian textbooks have improved greatly in recent years but some notable gaps and problems still exist. IPCRI reports an overriding nationalist theme in Palestinian textbooks, fostering pride and commitment to the Palestinian cause and cultural identity. As a corollary, some of the material \\"could be viewed by others (e.g., the Israelis) as promoting incitement and contempt\\". The textbooks often leave out historical events with great importance to Israel, such as the Oslo Accords, and references in any context to the State of Israel are minimal. The textbooks do feature peace educational materials, but not as they are applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The name 'Israel' does not appear on any maps in the textbooks, according to the report, and the textbooks are disapproving of Israeli policies like demolitions and occupations, and of Zionism as a whole. IPCRI reported that in the Israeli textbooks, information is presented in a Zionist framework, but acknowledge prospects for peace with others who inhabit the land. IPCRI researchers publicized that references to Arabs are minimal; those that do exist are sometimes stereotypical and negative. Some Israeli textbooks also teach that Arabs left their land willingly or sold it to the Jews on the eve of Israeli independence. The IPCRI reports were instrumental in refuting the claim that Palestinian textbooks \\"incite hatred or violence towards Israel and the Jews...or Western values\\". According to The Economist, the Israeli Minister of Education, three years after the reports of the release, urging Israeli schoolbooks to include more accurate maps and \\"enforcing\\" obligatory Arabic language education for elementary school students. This study has also been covered in the Wikipedia page Textbooks in the Palestinian territories.

According to its plot, the iconic pin-up model Bettie Page performs a burlesque show alongside Lili St. Cyr, Chris La Chris, Vicki Lynn, Bobby Shields, and others. Synopsis Varietease was Klaw's first documentary film reflective of burlesque clubs of the 1950s. Master of ceremonies Bobby Shields introduces the film's acts. Bettie Page performs a nudity-free Dance of the Seven Veils but teases in only removing four veils. Lili St. Cyr does four separate sequences, wherein she dresses and undresses to her underwear. Bettie Page returns presenting act cards while performing a few burlesque moves as she presents. Following are a comic, a female impersonator, the Barrow and Rodgers dance team, additional songs, and can-can dancers. The film ends with a pastie-covered reveal of Lili St. Cyr's chest. Cast * Lili St. Cyr as herself * Bettie Page as herself * Irving Klaw as himself * Christine Nelson as herself * Baros & Rogers as themselves * Cass Franklin as herself * Chris LaChris as herself * Monica Lane as herself * Shelley Leigh as herself * Vickie Lynn as herself * Peppe & Roccio as themselves * Bobby Shields as himself * Dave Starr as himself * Twinnie Wallen as herself Reception Bettie Page performed a \\"particularly sexy but amateurish\\" Dance of the Seven Veils in the film. One performance by female impersonator Vicki Lynn in the film was said to have \\"crystallized the transgressive potential of the burlesque film.\\" Varietease is one of the \\"famous compilations\\" of \\"classic burlesque shows.\\" The film was rereleased by Something Weird Video in 2006, sharing release with Teaserama. DVD Verdict noted that the films were both performed and staged as if for live audiences but offered: \\"Still, there is something endlessly fascinating about this old- fashioned flesh fest.\\" In looking at the films 50 years after they were made, it was noted that the comedians were bad, the dance acts \\"droned on,\\" and only a couple of the songs were mildly amusing. The reviewer stated that while the film would be best appreciated by viewers already fans of St. Cyr and Page, \\"[t]he stripping is indeed skillful and the ladies are almost always lovely to look at\\" and continued, \\"Sure, in 2006 these acts look positively tame. However, back when pornography was a social sin and fornication was for procreation, a glimpse of gam or a peek at some pert personal pillows was the height of honorable horniness.\\" Lawsuit The film was the subject of a lawsuit by Page's estate against Something Weird Video, an Oregon company that was marketing videos of the film. Page's estate argued that marketing materials for the video infringed on Page's rights as a celebrity. A U.S. district court ruled against Page's estate because the video company had legitimately obtained all rights to the film and its associated marketing materials.

History Founder Hans AdlerIn 1920 Michael and Margarethe Adler took over the former Hugel Inn and the butchery in Lindenstraße in Bonndorf. Due to the construction of the dam at the nearby Schluchsee reservoir in 1929 the sales volume increased as Adler catered the dining facility for the construction workers. From 1935 on Hans Adler, Michael and Margarethe’s son, and his wife ran the business and extended the range of products. Adler began to distribute its canned products, e.g. the well-known Bonndorfer Würstchen (Bonndorfer Sausages). In the 1950s the company started to sell Black Forest smoked specialities via mail order. In 1959 Hans Adler pioneered manufacturing and selling Original Black Forest ham by retail and mail order. The inn was closed in 1963, Adler erected an abattoir and meat cutting on the present-day company premises. In the following year Hans Adler OHG Schwarzwälder Fleischwaren was founded, Hans Adler’s son Peter became co-partner and systematically promoted the production of smoked products. Hans Adler retired in 1974 and the son Hansjörg joined the family-owned company as a partner. In 1975 the first portion of sliced Black Forest ham left the production line in self-service packaging. Also in this year an air-cured ham called Alemannian ham was added to the product range. In 1985 Adler acquired Kinzigtäler Fleischwaren GmbH, Haslach and Schwarzwaldrauch GmbH, Achern, which subsequently were renamed to Schwarzwaldfleisch GmbH. Since 1994 the specialization on ham products was further promoted by building up a pure ham business in Achern and by founding Schinkenhof GmbH & Co. KG. From the end of the 1990s Adler continually extended its product range, different traditional types of Wurstsalat are distributed under the brand Schnelle Küche. Adler also produces regional specialities like Landjäger and Schäufele. In 2010 Schwarzwaldfleisch introduced the brand name SchwarzwaldArt for Adler specialities and gifts.

World War II The lighthouse on the island was a cause of concern to Soviet forces in World War II and, at one stage, the keeper was captured and taken away for questioning by a landing party of Soviet marines. Polar bear In 1953, a polar bear was shot on the island. The bear was found by the brothers Aksel Jacobsen Bogdanoff (1922–1971) and Ingvald Bogdanoff (1920–1995) when they were out inspecting their salmon nets in the area. It was believed that the bear had come on an ice-floe from Svalbard. This is the last time that a polar bear was seen anywhere in Finnmark county. Population Although the island is now uninhabited, this was not always the case. In 1567, when there were only eight families in the town of Vadsø and five families in Store Ekkerøy, there were eight families on Lille Ekkerøy.

Background  He was a Seneca, born into the Turtle clan on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation, located in western New York State. He graduated from Hartwick College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1967, and later earned a Ph.D. from the University of Buffalo.  Work  Mohawk was a major visionary of the Haudenosaune Confederacy of Nations who played a singularly important role in fashioning the intellectual bridge of the traditional Indian movement toward the national and international community. Firmly based in the traditional Seneca Longhouse, he was a practitioner and master singer and orator. He was a writer, journalist, researcher, and lecturer. A specialist in the field of culture and community economic development and an activist and commentator on the cultural survival of indigenous peoples, Mohawk was a resolute traditionalist, social activist, and negotiator in local and international conflicts. He helped negotiate the conflict between the Sandinista government of Nicaragua and the Miskito people in 1983, and was a peace guide at armed standoffs between Native traditionalists and government agencies in North America. Mohawk was a co- founder of several organizations supporting Native Americans in the United States and internationally, such as the Indigenous Peoples Network and the Emergency Response International Network, the Seventh Generation Fund, the Indian Law Resource Center and the Iroquois White Corn Project. He worked tirelessly to revitalize indigenous agriculture, healthy food (e.g., Iroquois white corn) and the \\"Slow Food\\" movement. He was a journalist, a longtime editor, and contributor to \\"Akwesasne Notes\\", \\"Daybreak\\", and \\"Indian Country Today,\\" and director of the Center for Indigenous Studies at the Center of the Americas State University of New York (SUNY) in Buffalo, New York.  Books  * The Iroquois Creation Story: John Arthur Gibson and JNB Hewitt's Myth of the Earth Grasper * Utopian Legacies: A History of Conquest and Oppression in the Western World * The Red Buffalo * Thinking in Indian, a posthumously published collection of essays, edited by Jose Barreiro, is in print (Fulcrum).

The Swiss section remained active, but lost passenger service and was from then used only as a freight railway for the industries around Stabio. Since 1993 the line is also used by touristic trains on the re-opened line to Malnate.

Two of the engines are rated at and the other two at . The engines are connected via two gearboxes to two controllable pitch propellers. The two rudders, one behind each propeller, are of the Becker flap type with twisted leading edges. Control of the bow while docking is by two tunnel thrusters. Heat from the main engines is also used to heat the ship. =Loading characteristics= The vehicle decks can be loaded on two levels from both the bow and stern on decks 3 and 5 and there are two-tier linkspans in both Harwich and Hoek van Holland to accommodate the ship. Construction and career The ferries, then designated \\"RoPax 55\\" ferries, were originally ordered from the shipbuilders Waden Yards (subsequently subsumed into Nordic Yards Wismar) by Stena Line in 2006. The total value of the order amounted to approximately €400 million. Delays arose when Stena temporarily withdrew the order in response to economic difficulties being experienced by Waden Yards. After further negotiations the order was reinstated, but the new agreement included a price cut of 6% or approximately €24 million. The ships having been completed, naming ceremonies took place on 8 June 2010 for at Hoek van Holland and on 19 October 2010 at Harwich for Stena Britannica. On the overnight crossing between Hoek van Holland and Harwich on 17 January 2018, a fire broke out on one of the refrigerated lorries and subsequently spread to other lorries but did not breach the lorry decks. The vessel was subsequently taken to Schiedam and returned to service three days after the fire.

It stars Mohan Babu, Nagarjuna Akkineni, Preeti Jhangiani, Soundarya in the lead roles and music composed by Koti. The film is a remake of the Malayalam film Narasimham (2000). Plot Yogendra (Mohan Babu) is the son of Panduranga Rao (Vijayakumar), a High Court judge who got the first rank in civil services examinations. Dunnapothula Janardhan Rao (Narra Venkateswara Rao), a politician, falsely implicates Yogi in a murder case to take revenge on Panduranga, who had earlier given a jail sentence to him in a corruption case. Panduranga gives the judgment for Yogi by jailing him for six years. After six years, Janardhan dies on the same day when Yogi is released from jail. Dunnapothula Dharma Rao (Mukesh Rushi), Janardhan's son, visits the shores of Godavari River to leave the ashes. Yogi foils the rites by resisting, then Dharma challenges Yogi that he is going to mix the ashes of his father in the Godavari before Yogi mixes the ashes of his father, who is still alive, one day. Meanwhile, Yogi falls in love with a beautiful girl named Anuradha (Preeti Jhangiani), the strong-willed and independent-minded daughter of Kaasi Visweswara Rao (Raghunatha Reddy), Dharma's henchman. Suddenly, there is an appearance of a girl named Thulasi (Seema), who claims to be Panduranga's daughter, but Panduranga flatly refuses the claim and banishes her. Forced by circumstances and at the instigation help of Dharma, she reluctantly comes out open with the parentage claim. Yogi, at first, thrashes the protesters, but upon knowing the truth from his uncle Gnaneswara Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao), he accepts the task of her protection in the capacity as her elder brother. Yogi decides to marry Thulasi to his good friend (Brahmaji). He also confronts his father and prods him to accept his mistake and acknowledge his parentage to Thulasi. Panduranga ultimately regrets and secretly goes on to confess to his daughter. The very next morning when Yogi returns home, Thulasi is found dead. Panduranga is accused of murdering her, but the whole act was planned by Dharma, who, after killing Thulasi, forces Satya Murthy (Suthi Velu), Panduranga's longtime servant, to testify against Panduranga in court. In court, Jagan (Nagarjuna Akkineni), a close friend of Yogi and famous leading criminal lawyer, appears as the defense council by cancelling his marriage with his girlfriend (Soundarya) for friendship and wins the case to lay bare the murder plot and the hidden intentions of baddies. Finally, Panduranga is judged innocent of the crime by the court. After that, Yogi returns to his father, who now shows remorse for all his actions, including not believing in his son's innocence. Panduranga then dies at Yogi's feet. At Panduranga's funeral, Dharma arrives to poke fun at Yogi and also tries to carry out Janardhan's postponed last rituals. Yogi interrupts the ritual and avenges for the deaths of his sister and father with Jagan's help. Cast Soundtrack Music composed by Koti. Music released on TIPS Audio Company.

The estate spans some 2,000 acres and broadly covers the area between Wetherby and the villages of Spofforth and Sicklinghall. In addition to traditional activities including farming and properties, Stockeld Park is also home to Yorkshire's largest Christmas tree plantation, with some 500,000 Christmas trees in the ground. Stockeld Park is perhaps best known for its Adventure Park, a seasonal attraction that offers a range of indoor and outdoor activities that vary by season. The Christmas Adventure offers ice skating, cross-country skiing, an Enchanted Forest, Santa's Grotto and a giant, snowflake-shaped yew tree maze. Other seasons offer adventure playgrounds, boating, pedal go-karts, motorised scooters and a range of themed events. The mansion house itself is constructed of stone in the style of a Palladian villa and features a cantilevered staircase, 18th and 19th century furniture and works of art. Features of the grounds include a dovecote, lodges, a ha-ha, a walled garden and thatched timber loggia. History The Stockeld (also earlier known as Stokeld)A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Part 5 (EPNS 34), Cambridge 1961; http://placenames.org.uk/id/placename/34/001797 estate has its name from the half knight's fee of land held by Nigel de Stokeld (also Stockeld) in 1166, formerly part of the estates of William de Percy.Early Yorkshire Charters Vol 12, page 256. Around 1315, the Stockeld estate passed to William de Middleton of Ilkley.Early Yorkshire Charters, Volume 11, page 257 In 1757, William de Middleton commissioned architect James Paine to build the present house, which was completed by 1763. William Middelton died before it was completed and the house and estate passed to his infant great-nephew, William Constable. Constable adopted the name and arms of Middelton and eventually took up residence, but his wife, the mother of his 10 children, had a high-profile affair with a groom. William, after divorcing his wife, left Stockeld to live in his other property in Ilkley, leaving the house empty for some two decades. Succeeding generations of Middeltons continued to live at Ilkley, leasing out Stockeld until it was eventually sold in 1893 to Robert John Foster, owner of Black Dyke Mills in Bradford. Foster commissioned architect Detmar Blow to make several improvements, including converting the orangery to a chapel, and was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire for 1898–99. During the Second World War, the house was requisitioned for use as a maternity hospital. The chapel dates from 1895 and is a grade II listed building. Stockeld is now occupied by Peter Grant, a great-grandchild of Robert John Foster. The main rooms are used for receptions and conferences.

History University of Patras with the Rio–Antirrio bridge in the background Temple of Zeus in ancient Olympia On 4 August 2008 a public-private partnership deal came into effect with the Greek state conceding construction and 30 years of maintenance of the Olympia Odos motorway to the international Olympia Odos S.A. consortium. In return for the right to collect tolls, the consortium will invest a total of €2.8 billion for construction and modernization of the highway. The upgrade of the A8 (Elefsina–Corinth–Rio) and the southern section of the A5 (Rio–Pyrgos–Tsakona) by Olympia Odos S.A. has been described as \\"the largest and most challenging project currently undertaken in Greece, and one of the most complex ones in Europe.\\". It also includes the construction of of tunnels and twenty interchanges. Subsequently, preexisting dual carriageway of the Patras bypass and the National Road 8a section Elefsina–Corinth) were further upgraded to full motorway standards. of preexisting single carriageway in the Corinth – Patras section were doubled. of the southern A5 section (Patras–Pyrgos–Kalamata) will be newly constructed.

It has been developed by Sustainability Solutions Group, a Canadian workers co-operative, and has been widely used in British Columbia since 2008, with regular revisions and updates from SSG's GHGProof pages. Reviews of GHGProof and comparison to other modelling platforms may be found in references.Comparison with other modelsDalhousie University Thesis Project analysing GHGProof and another modelDetailed comparison of GHG models by Government of BC  History  GHGProof was first conceived in a project designed to evaluate the impact of a land-use plan on Salt Spring Island in BC, commissioned by the Islands Trust.The GHG Implications of Different Settlement Patterns on Salt Spring Island Following this project, SSG was awarded a research grant from CMHC and worked with the Fraser Valley Regional District to develop an open source model for wide distribution. GHGProof was piloted with the City of Abbotsford and the Town of Hope, and baseline GHG inventories were created for a workshop with all the FVRD municipalities in which they could develop scenarios. The Government of BC requires that all municipalities include GHG targets in their official community plans, creating an incentive for this type of modelling.BC Government's Climate Change Policies An article in Municipal World describes the use of the model in the FVRD.Municipal World Article: Addressing Climate Change  Architecture  GHGProof consists of two components. The first component is a series of analysis in GIS that analyse travel behaviour, building distribution and forest and agricultural areas for a community. The second component is an excel spreadsheet that takes inputs from the GIS analysis and uses a series of calculations to generate GHG emissions, energy use and energy costs for a community. For a detailed summary on the structure of the model see the GHGProof Guidebook. Interactive skins have been placed over the model to facilitate community engagement.  Scope  GHGProof includes GHG emissions and reductions from public and private transportation, mode shifting to walking and cycling, commercial transportation, private dwellings, commercial buildings, embodied carbon from road construction, district energy, agricultural practices, liquid and solid waste, food miles (transportation of food), forest area and forest practices. New parameters are added periodically. Outputs of the model include total GHG emissions, per capita GHG emissions, reductions by type, energy use by type, vehicle kilometres travelled, mode share, $ savings from energy, $ of investment, jobs created and marginal abatement cost.  Uses  GHGProof has been used by communities to evaluate land-use planning decisions including to develop an achievable GHG target, develop a realistic strategy to achieve a target, evaluate a large- scale development proposal and evaluate a land-use plan.

Description Carwynnen Quoit is one of an ancient and rare group of monuments, and can be found at Carwynnen in Cornwall. It is a portal dolmen belonging to the Neolithic period, possibly 5000 years old, one of the few Cornish portal dolmens to be found outside the Penwith peninsula. It is situated on a gentle west-facing slope between two small tributaries to the Red River. The dolmen stands to a height of 1.5m with a capstone measuring approximately 3.3m long by 2.5m wide and 0.3m thick, and weighs approximately 10 tons. History The site was first recorded by the Welsh antiquarian Edward Lhuyd around 1700Lhuyd, E 1700 Fol.2r CAMBRON MS Rawlinson D 997, Bodelian Library and a symbol of the cromlech appeared on Martyn’s 1748 map of Cornwall.Martyn’s map of Cornwall 1748 These are early references to ancient sites.

The five acre site was purchased by The Sustainable Trust in 2009.Ancient monument Carwynnen Quoit rebuilding starts, BBC News, 2 May 2014 Together with the Cornwall Heritage Trust they employed professional archaeologists to help research the site prior to its reconstruction. In September 2012 an archaeological dig took place after a preliminary investigation in July 2012. Troon Primary School in September 2012 was the first School to be involved in a pilot archaeological week based on an education pack drawn up in 2009. During this time there was also an Open Day for the community at large to learn about the monument and archeology. Findings from the dig were on display for all to see and the event was televised. A website called the Giant's Quoit was created to showcase the finds, explain archaeological evidence and present the restoration process. The first stones were re-erected in May 2014. Two support stones were replaced in their original Neolithic footings but the third stone had to be adjusted to create a more stable structure. The work was completed in June 2014 when the capstone was dropped into position by a large crane.

He has been the bishop of the Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania since 2012. Biography =Early life and priestly ministry= Lawrence Persico was born November 21, 1950 in Monessen, Pennsylvania. He attended St. Cajetan Elementary School. In 1969 he graduated from St. Joseph Hall Minor Seminary (now St. Joseph Hall High School) in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. He received his bachelor's degree from the St. Pius X Seminary in Erlanger, Kentucky. He earned his M.Div from Saint Vincent Seminary in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Persico was ordained as a priest for the Diocese of Greensburg on April 30, 1977. Persico served as parochial vicar of Immaculate Conception Parish in Irwin, Pennsylvania from 1977 to 1980. In 1982, he received a J.C.L. degree in canon law at the Catholic University of America. On his return to the diocese of Greensburg, Bishop William Connare appointed him assistant chancellor of Assumption Hall in Greensburg, where he served from 1983 to 1984. Persico then served as vice-chancellor of the diocese from 1984 to 1989, and chancellor beginning in 1989. During this time, he also served as chaplain to the Sisters of Charity in Greensburg. In 1998, Persico became pastor of Saint James Parish in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania, where he served until being named bishop in 2012. He served as moderator of the curia, and as the bishop's delegate for clergy sexual abuse. In 2005, Bishop Lawrence Brandt made Persico vicar general of the diocese. From 2006 to 2011, he served two terms as vice-president of the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference. He was named a monsignor in either 2005 or 2008. Episcopal career =Bishop of Erie= On July 31, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI announced the appointment of Persico to the Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania. He was consecrated on October 1, 2012 at the diocese's St. Peter Cathedral. =Response to sex abuse cases= In early 2016, a grand jury investigation, led by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, began an inquiry into sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in six Pennsylvania dioceses: Allentown, Scranton, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Greensburg, and Erie. The grand jury report was published on August 14, 2018. When speaking about Persico's handling of the case of Rev. David Poulson, a perpetrator of sexual abuse, \\"Shapiro said the diocese knew since at least May 2010 of Poulson’s sexual predator tendencies – but did nothing to report him to authorities until September 2016, in response to a subpoena from the grand jury.\\" Persico was installed as bishop of the Erie Diocese in 2012, which points to the fact that it took him four years to deem the allegations against Poulson to be credible. (Persico claims that \\"Poulson's name was not raised\\" during this four year span). Jim VanSickle, one of Poulson's accusers, said in an interview: “I do believe Bishop (Donald) Trautman and Bishop (Lawrence) Persico (of the Erie Diocese) knew.\\" “Father Poulson came forward in 2010 and said he becomes aroused around adolescent boys and he had a problem,” said VanSickle in the same interview. This detail was in fact kept on record within the Bishop's archives ever since 2010. Although Persico's response to abuse cases has been largely praised by the local press, Persico's negligence in the Diocese of Greensburg is well cataloged in the official Grand Jury Report: Page 510 of the report reads: \\"On April 12, 2002, a phone call was received by Father Lawrence Persico from a witness (\\"Witness #1\\"), the contents of which were provided to Statnick. Witness #1 claimed that Sredzinski abused a relative of hers in Brownsville, PA in 1985 and that Sredzinski should be looked into further. There was nothing otherwise noted in the file regarding this phone call, including whether there was any follow-up by the Diocese.\\" Page 509 of Grand Jury Report reads: \\"According to notes in Sredzinski's Diocesan file, on April 9, 2007, the mother of a classmates of Victim #1 placed a telephone call to Persico and informed him that her son had told her that when he was in 7th or 8th grade, Sredzinski abused Victim #1. It was her understanding that Victim #1's parents tried to report the incident to Statnick when Victim #1 was in 7th or 8th grade, but that nothing was ever done about it. She also indicated that Sredzinski took Victim #1 and her son overnight to Seven Springs when they were young. Persico's response was that because Victim #1 was 28 years old at the time of the mother's call, Victim #1 needed to report any abuse by Sredzinski himself.\\" [The subsequent sentence pertaining to Persico's handling of this particular case is curiously redacted within the official report]. In 2017 Persico settled a lawsuit outside of court regarding the complaints a former diocesan employee, after Rev. Daniel Kresinski repeatedly made unwanted advances upon her using obscene sexual gestures. The former employee claims she was forced to resign in October 2013 because the diocese failed to “address or remedy” what she claims was the sexually hostile work environment, according to the lawsuit. Persico initially told her that \\"he did not want her to contact the press with her complaint and asked her to sign a nondisclosure agreement,\\" which she initially declined to sign. Before the victim finally agreed to a private monetary settlement, Persico's lawyer unsuccessfully requested the Court to throw out the case on the grounds that it “would require the Court to engage in an impermissible evaluation of the church’s internal governance in violation of the First Amendment.\\" Persico was one of the few prelates to be praised in the grand jury report detailing clerical sexual abuse in six Pennsylvania dioceses, for his cooperation with the grand jury investigation. Shapiro stated, \\"Bishop Persico’s response to this crisis gives me hope. He was the only (bishop) to testify to the grand jury. He wanted to do the right thing. He did.\\" In April 2018, only three months prior to the release of the findings of the grand jury report to the general public, the Diocese of Erie published a list of 34 priests and 17 laypeople who had been \\"credibly accused\\" of sexually abusing children. By July, the list had grown to include 64 names. Persico has yet to publicly denounce and condemn the extensive history of cover-up orchestrated by his predecessor, Bishop Trautman. As of January 2020, Trautman keeps an office at the Catholic Diocese of Erie’s main building on East Grandview Boulevard in Erie, despite the fact that Persico acknowledged there had been a cover-up in the church. As of May 2019 he has yet to clarify pages 509-510 of the Grand Jury report which make it evident that he [Persico] failed to report an abuse case to civil authorities while he worked under the Greensburg Diocese. Also, Persico has not explained why it took him four years to review the file of abuse allegations involving Rev. David Poulson within the Erie Diocese. After the Grand Jury report was released, Persico stated that he felt that the grand jury report should have included the names of accused laypeople who worked for the Erie Diocese as well. James Faluszczak claims that he attempted to report an abuse case to the Erie Diocese twice regarding Rev. Daniel J. Martin — \\"first to Bishop Donald Trautman in 2010, and then to his successor, Bishop Lawrence Persico.\\" Faluszczak says he had \\"several conversations with Persico from October 2013 to February 2016, in which he also presented allegations on behalf of other victims.\\" Faluszczak says that Persico \\"totally ignored\\" his claims. \\"He certainly treated me as if it was nothing. He didn't take it seriously,\\" complains Faluszczak. \\"When I told him that Father Martin molested me 15 times, he couldn't even bring himself to say that he was sorry that that happened to me.\\"  References  External links * Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie Official Site * Curriculum Vitae ′ 1950 births Roman Catholic bishops of Erie Living people People from Monessen, Pennsylvania Saint Vincent Seminary alumni 21st-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Lawrence T.

He graduated from Dhaka Medical College in 1976, and completed his Masters studies in Public Health (MPH) and Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA in 1985 and in 1990 respectively. Baqui's research confirmed: (a) the use of zinc supplementation during diarrhea to reduce the severity of child mortality. (b) the effectiveness of trained community health workers providing home based health care to reduce neonatal mortality by one-third. and (c) use of Hib vaccination in Bangladesh to reduce the incidence of meningitis and X-ray documented pneumonia in children. Each of these studies has influenced policy decisions. For example, WHO and UNICEF have now recommended the use of zinc as an adjuvant therapy for diarrheal episode. Bangladesh developed a national neonatal health strategy in 2009 that references Baqui's work. More recently a WHO-UNICEF joint statement recommends home visits by trained community health worker as a strategy to improve neonatal survival, based in part on Baqui's research. Baqui became a professor in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2009. In May 2012, the CORE Group honored Baqui with the Dory Storms Child Survival Recognition Award.

She is a judoka.Athlete profile at London2012.com At the 2012 Summer Olympics Jennifer Anson competed in the Women's 63 kg, but was quickly defeated in the initial elimination round of 32. Anson was on her back and out almost as soon as her first fight had started, overwhelmed by a far superior and younger Mongolian opponent, Munkhzaya Tsedevsuren. In only 46 seconds, the 26-year-old Mongolian pummeled and strangled Anson resulting in an Ippon, or technical knockout, and a perfect score of 110 to 0, the highest possible score in judo. The strangling technique used is called okuri eri jime. The bout has been described as a cameo Olympic appearance for Anson that ended in a flash. The 46 second round was the shortest contest in the elimination round of 32 which entitled Anson to be one of London 2012's \\"unusual athletes\\". After the match, Anson stated that, \\"when I was out there, everything blacked out in my head\\" and the fight was over before she could think of what to do. It is unclear if this was the result of the strangling or a panicked athlete, but Anson did say that, “when the fight started, I forgot everything. I wanted to be defensive-minded but still trying to be aggressive. All of sudden I was on the mat and the fight was lost.” Anson's quick defeat is attributed to her inexperience as she filled a quota slot for Oceania after finishing 86th out of 178 places. At 35 years, she was also the oldest competitor among the 24 contestants in the 63k category, followed by 33-year- old Elisabeth Willeboordse of the Netherlands. The majority of the Olympic athletes were in their 20s. After the stunning length of the fight, Anson explained that she intended to set an example for younger members of her judo club in Palau of which there are 10 members with 40 kids learning the sport.

The album, named by Ron Sexsmith, is the first in a series of three holiday compilations released through the record label between 2002 and 2004. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of each album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Most of the tracks exclusive to Maybe This Christmas were recorded just a few months prior to its release. The album's cover art was designed by artist Paul Frank, creator of Julius the pictured \\"wide-mouth monkey\\". Critical reception of the compilation was mixed, with reviewers often complimenting or criticizing select tracks. In the United States, the album reached a peak position of number thirty-eight on Billboard Top Holiday Albums chart. Background and composition Ron Sexsmith named the compilation series and contributed the title track. Maybe This Christmas is the first in a series of three consecutive holiday compilation albums released through Nettwerk. Maybe This Christmas Too? and Maybe This Christmas Tree were released in October 2003 and October 2004, respectively. The series was named by Ron Sexsmith, who contributed the title track to the compilation. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of each album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. Maybe This Christmas contains thirteen \\"rock-oriented\\" tracks recorded by various artists. Most of the tracks exclusive to the album were recorded just a few months prior to its release. Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson dubbed the compilation an \\"album suited for those twenty-somethings searching for [their] not-so-typical Christmas collection.\\" The cover art was designed by artist Paul Frank, creator of Julius the \\"illustrated, wide-mouth monkey\\". The album opens with Phantom Planet's \\"sweet rock romp\\" rendition of Felix Bernard and Richard B. Smith's \\"Winter Wonderland\\". Sexsmith's title track is less than two minutes in length and has a shuffling beat. \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" (Ralph Blane, Hugh Martin) features a downtempo, \\"jazz-like\\" solo piano performance by Chris Martin of Coldplay. Tracks exclusive to the album include Vanessa Carlton's piano-driven rendition of the traditional song \\"Greensleeves\\" as well as Bright Eyes' cover of \\"Blue Christmas\\" (Bill Hayes, Jay Johnson); others include Sense Field's version of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" and \\"What a Year for a New Year\\" by Dan Wilson, lead singer of the rock band Semisonic. Jimmy Eat World's \\"12/23/95\\", described by The Austin Chronicle Christopher Gray as \\"serious emo\\" and The New York Times Kelefa Sanneh as a \\"gentle ballad of apology\\", previously appeared on the band's 1999 album Clarity. The song title and date refer to Little Christmas Eve, the traditional day on which Norwegians decorate Christmas trees. Jack Johnson incorporates an \\"upbeat street-corner\\" shuffle into his version of \\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\\" (Johnny Marks, Robert L. May), just over two minutes in length. The traditional song \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" is performed as a duet by the Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan. Following is a string of original songs, including \\"Bizarre Christmas Incident\\" by Ben Folds, \\"What a Year for a New Year\\" by Dan Wilson and Neil Finn's \\"Sweet Secret Peace\\". \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"Bizarre Christmas Incident\\" were recorded previously for fans but had not been released commercially. The closing track, \\"Snow\\" (Archibald Lampman, Loreena McKennitt) was performed by McKennitt and has been described as a \\"haunting, orchestral new-age hymn that could fit nicely into a midnight Mass.\\" Reception Maybe This Christmas received mixed critical reception. Many reviewers complimented or criticized select tracks, though Jimmy Eat World's \\"12/23/95\\" received the most praise. Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson awarded the album three out of five stars and described it as a \\"solid holiday effort\\" for both \\"casual and die-hard music fans\\". Wilson considered \\"12/23/95\\" the album's standout track and wrote that performances by Bright Eyes, Loreena McKennitt, Sense Field, and Dan Wilson provided traditional carols with a \\"fresh face\\" along with their own \\"dash of coolness\\". She also complimented Coldplay's rendition of \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", calling it as \\"endearing\\" as the original, and thought Sarah McLachlan's \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" was \\"playfully charming\\". Christopher Gray of The Austin Chronicle considered \\"Blue Christmas\\" the best and \\"Bizarre Christmas Incident\\" the \\"funniest\\" track on the compilation. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a \\"B\\" rating and called it a \\"mixed bag\\". He described performances by Vanessa Carlton and Bright Eyes as \\"painful\\" but also complimented the Barenaked Ladies and McLachlan for their collaboration. Willman considered Wilson's \\"What a Year for a New Year\\" the stand-out track of the album. Annie Zaleski of The Phoenix rated the album 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling some of the collection \\"gorgeous and alluring\\" but most of it \\"subdued\\". Zaleski complimented the title track but criticized performances by Coldplay and Bright Eyes, the latter for its \\"unsteady, wobbly twang\\". Zaleski and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times also praised \\"12/23/95\\". Zaleski concluded: \\"Not exactly your traditional take on traditional holiday fare, but a pleasant alternative to all the muzak you have to put up with this time of year.\\" Track listing Ben Folds performing in 2009; one reviewer called \\"Bizarre Christmas Incident\\" the album's \\"funniest\\" track. # \\"Winter Wonderland\\" (Felix Bernard, Richard B.

The libretto, by A. A. Kryukov, is based on the life of the Renaissance artist Raphael. The text was written in Russian and immediately translated into Italian by L. Egidi. The opera was composed in 1894 for the First Congress of Russian Artists and dedicated to the Moscow Society of Lovers of the Arts. It premiered in Italian at the Moscow Conservatory on 6 May (old calendar: 26 April), with set-design by Leonid Pasternak; Yevgeniya Mravina took the role of Fornarina, Raphael's model and mistress. Arensky chose a work on non-Russian subject matter and distanced himself from the nationalistic tendencies of his teacher Rimsky- Korsakov. Raphael was less well-received than its predecessor, Arensky's first opera Dream on the Volga. The only fragment remaining popular till now is the Folk Singer's Song off-stage that is usual in the repertoire of Russian tenors. In 2018 its English translation (“My heart is trembling with passion and pleasure”) was published (see the link below). Structure :Introduction (Overture) :I. Chorus of Apprentices :II.

A ' was realised by using a sensitive valve, which required little force to operate, to modulate the flow of a stream of compressed air. The basic principle of the valves used in these devices was to pass the stream of compressed air through two partially overlapping combs. The sound vibrations to be amplified were applied to one of the combs, causing it to move laterally in relation to the other comb, varying the degree of overlap and so altering the flow of compressed air in sympathy with the sound vibrations. The ', designed for large halls, was a compressed air gramophone which employed compressed air to amplify the recorded sound.Wierzbicki (2009), p. 74; \\"Representative Kinematograph Shows\\" (1907).The Auxetophone and Other Compressed-Air Gramophones explains pneumatic amplification and includes several detailed photographs of Gaumont's Elgéphone, which was apparently a slightly later and more elaborate version of the Chronomégaphone.

He was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1982 until 1985, representing the electorate of Sandringham. Ihlein was born in the Sydney suburb of Lakemba, and attended Yagoona State School. His family later moved to Victoria, where he attended Morwell High School and studied law at Monash University. He worked as a research officer (1974-1975) and senior industrial officer (1975-1979) for the Australian Public Service Association, and was a federal industrial officer for the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association from 1979 until 1982. Ihlein had joined the Labor Party in 1975, had been the Sandringham campaign manager in 1979, and was a member of the party's economic policy committee from 1981 to 1982. Ihlein was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1982 state election, winning the formerly safe Liberal seat of Sandringham. Sandringham had been held by the Liberal Party since its inception, and while the seat had become considerably more marginal since a 1976 redistribution, the incumbent Liberal MLA, Max Crellin, had held off Labor challenges in 1976 and 1979. Ihlein campaigned for eighteen months prior to the election, and focused heavily on retaining the Sandringham railway line, which had been threatened with closure under a report made for the previous government. The campaign proved to be successful, with Ihlein winning a narrow victory as the Cain Labor government won office statewide. A redistribution prior to the 1985 election made Sandringham notionally Liberal again. Ihlein instead contested and lost Evelyn to Liberal Jim Plowman, while Ihlein staffer and future federal MP Ann Corcoran contested and lost Sandringham.

Design and development HAL Dhruv-WSI prototype While flight testing the Light Combat Helicopter, a modified version of HAL Dhruv, the Indian Army came to the conclusion that without making any major modifications to the Dhruv airframe, an armed variant could also be developed and delivered to the Army quickly. This variant was named Rudra. The Rudra underwent integration trial for armament and electro-optical systems and a final round of weapon firing trials in September 2011, which included testing of the 20-mm turret gun. The 70 mm rockets and MBDA Mistral air-to-air missiles were tested in November 2011. The helicopter exceeded the payload and performance requirements at the height of 6 km. It has integrated sensors, weapons and electronic warfare suite, and uses an upgraded version of the glass cockpit used in the HAL Dhruv Mk.3. The sensors include stabilised day and night cameras, infrared imaging as well as laser ranging and designation. It has an Integrated Defensive Aids Suite (IDAS) from Saab AB, with electronic warfare self-protection which is fully integrated into the glass cockpit. On- board self-defence systems include radar & missile detectors, IR jammer, chaff and flare dispensers. The helicopter can be used in both unarmed and armed roles that include reconnaissance, troop transport, anti-tank warfare and close air support. HAL Rudra at Aero India 2013 In September 2012, ground tests for the first production Rudra were completed. It featured a turret gun, rockets, air-to-air missiles and could carry air-to-ground missiles like the anti-tank helicopter-launched Nag. HAL was awarded with a combined order of 76 Rudras for the Indian Army, the primary customer, and the Indian Air Force. The Indian Navy conducted flight trials in 2012-13, and found the helicopter suitable for coastal surveillance operations. It was impressed with the capability of the Rudra's sensors to track ships at 12 and 14 km. The image quality of the sensors was described as good enough to even read the name of ships at those ranges, and the Navy was keen to order at least 20 helicopters.

The first Brain Storm appeared in Justice League of America #32 (December 1964) and was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky. Brainstorm made his first live-action debut on the fourth season of The Flash, portrayed by Kendrick Sampson. Fictional character biography =Axel Storm= Axel Storm had created a special helmet that allowed him to absorb stellar energy, which he could use to create virtually anything which his imagination could conceive. This invention having warped his mind, Brain Storm witnessed his brother Fred's apparent death. In his twisted ideals, Brain Storm had captured the Justice League so that they could witness him taking justice into his own hands and killing the man responsible for his brother's demise. Part of his plan involved stealing the powers and abilities from the Justice League members and redistributing them to random people. However, a side effect to Brain Storm's power was that whoever the power was used upon could also access the energy abilities and the JLA members were suddenly mentally linked to the people who had gained their abilities. Transporting them to Brain Storm's base, their arrival freed the Justice League from Brain Storm's trap and they fought against him. They battled a group of stellar-energy powered threats, and came to realize who it was that Brain Storm blamed for his brothers death - the Green Lantern. However, Green Lantern explained that due to Brain Storm's interference with his attempt to capture Fred (who just robbed a bank), the combination of both their powers transported Fred to France and erased his memories. Bringing Fred to them and restoring his memory, the Justice League convinced Brain Storm to end his vendetta against the Green Lantern. However, Brain Storm realized that escape was the best course of action and teleported away without a trace, leaving the JLA to turn his brother over to the police.Justice League of America #32 Brain Storm soon returned however to plague the League once again. This time, he used his powers to give each team member a severe physical disability. Superman was struck blind, Flash's legs were fused together, Green Arrow suddenly had no arms, Green Lantern began to stutter both literally and mentally, and Hawkman developed breathing problems. In spite of these handicaps, the JLA managed to overcome the odds and fight back against Brain Storm. After the battle, Brain Storm restored all the JLA members back to normal. Brain Storm retaliated though and used his power to create duplicates of himself. He also succeeded in capturing the League, turning all but Batman into his drone slaves. Finally determining which foe was the real Brain Storm, Batman knocked him out, relinquishing his control over the JLA members.Justice League of America #36 Some years later, Brain Storm turned up again, this time without the benefit of his powers. He kidnapped the Terrorsmith in the hopes of using his powers to reactivate his own lost abilities. This plan proved unsuccessful however, and the Terrorsmith was able to escape.Showcase '94 #7 Brain Storm, or someone dressed like Brain Storm, was one of many costumed villains who attended Roulette's \\"House of Pain\\", although he did not participate in any of the exhibition events. It is unclear whether this was actually Brain Storm himself, or perhaps one of the other spectators who enjoyed dressing up as a famous super-villain.JSA #28 =Alan Barnes= A different version of Brainstorm named Alan Barnes appears in S.T.A.R. Corps. A research volunteer with artificially generated psionic abilities created by S.T.A.R. Labs. He uncovers the true nature of the Mindgame computer and the Gamesman units. =Dominic Lanse= A new Brainstorm debuted against Michael Holt, but is not related to the original. He is Dominic Lanse, a silicon valley scientist who was working on downloading unique intellects into machines. His success was reversed by an accident that let him reverse the process and transfer those intellects into himself.Mister Terrific #2 But Mister Terrific is able to supercharge his mind with the T-Spheres rendering him unconscious.

It was originally laid-out in the early 18th century as the city expanded eastwards beyond the original city walls. History At the start of the 18th century, Oliver Plunkett Street was the first street built east of the Grand Parade in the area then known as the East Marsh or Dunscombe Marsh. It was originally named George's Street after George I, the then reigning King of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1920, during the Burning of Cork, large parts of the street were destroyed by British troops. After the establishment of the Irish Free State, the street was renamed after Oliver Plunkett, a 17th-century martyr and Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh. The name change was gradual and as late as 1945, business directories still contained a reference to 'Late George's Street'. Cork's lowest-lying street, at 4 metres above sea level, the street is prone to periodic flooding when the River Lee bursts its banks. Location and use The street runs in a straight line from Custom House Street to Grand Parade. Other streets lead off from Oliver Plunkett Street in a grid pattern, such as Prince’s Street, Cook Street, and Smith Street. With 15 streets on both sides of Oliver Plunkett Street, there are a number of access points to the street from St. Patrick's Street to the north and the South Mall to the south. Between Grand Parade and Parnell Place, the street is a shopping street. This section of the street is also home to Cork's General Post Office. A small lane, known as Market Lane, provides access to the English Market. There are over one hundred independent retailers on the street, many of which have been family-owned for several generations. It is also one of a number of nightlife centres in Cork - although there are more bars and restaurants on the neighbouring side streets than on Oliver Plunkett Street itself. Between Parnell Place and Custom House Quay, the east end of the street is known as Oliver Plunkett Street Lower. Pedestrianisation A number of the side streets between Oliver Plunkett Street and St. Patrick's Street are fully pedestrianized. Along with neighbouring streets, the section of Oliver Plunkett Street between Parnell Place and Grand Parade is pedestrianized between 10:30am and 4:30pm every day. Automatic bollards are installed at the junction with Parnell Place and also at the junctions of Princes St and South Mall, Pembroke St and Phoenix St and Maylor St and St. Patrick's Street, to create this pedestrianised area. Awards The street won the 'Great Street Award', awarded by London's Academy of Urbanism, in 2016.

The type and only species, Callistomordax kugleri, was named in 2008. It is known from several well-preserved skeletons found in the Erfurt Formation, part of the Lower Keuper, which dates back to the late Ladinian stage.  History of study and provenance  The first specimen of Callistomordax kugleri, which is currently reposited at the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde (SMNS) in Stuttgart, Germany, was collected from the Middle Triassic (Upper Ladinian-aged) Erfurt Formation of Baden-Württemberg by Werner Kugler, for whom the species is named. Various authors speculated on the taxonomic affinities of the specimen, but it was not formally resolved until 2008. The specimen was subsequently donated to the SMNS and additional excavation at the original locality in 2000 led to the discovery of two nearly complete skeletons by private collectors Hans Michael Salomon and Traugott Haubold.  Anatomy  Callistomordax was distinguished from other temnospondyls by characters such as a single co-ossified frontal (normally paired in tetrapods), a pterygoid with both a broad and flat quadrate ramus and a slender and narrow palatine ramus, and lateral compression of the palatal and symphyseal fangs. It shares a number of metoposaurid synapomorphies such as deeply sloping postparietals and tabulars but also retains more primitive features found in earlier diverging temnospondyls and a number of probable homoplasies.  Ecology  As with many Triassic temnospondyls, Callistomordax is considered to have been an aquatic freshwater tetrapod, evidenced by both its anatomy (e.g., lateral line system) and its depositional environment. The Lower Keuper Basin where Callistomordax was found was subjected to repeated transgression-regression cycles, resulting in mixed deposits of freshwater and marine taxa. Callistomordax is relatively rare and consists only of isolated elements in bonebeds with higher abundances of marine taxa, and the most complete specimens are found with various invertebrates and fish that suggest a relatively low salinity environment. Phylogeny Below is a cladogram from Schoch (2008): Callistomordax is significant in filling a gap in the fossil record that inhibited firm conclusions regarding the origins of the Metoposauridae, which had previously been variably suggested to be placed in the Permian Dvinosauria or within the Triassic Trematosauria. As seen in the above phylogeny, Callistomordax is the sister taxon to the Metoposauridae and places the Metoposauroidea (Metoposauridae + Callistomordax) within Trematosauria.

The MRM training programme was launched in 1993 - at that time under the name Bridge Resource Management - and aims at preventing accidents at sea caused by human error. In MRM training it is assumed that there is a strong correlation between the attitudes and behaviours of the seafarers on board a ship and the cultures that these seafarers belong to. The most relevant cultures in this respect being the professional, national and organizational cultures. Important target groups for MRM training are therefore, besides ships’ officers and crew, all people in shore organisations who have an influence on safety at sea and the work on board a ship.  Overview  = Definition = The use and co-ordination of all the skills, knowledge, experience and resources available to the team to achieve the established goals of safety and efficiency of a voyage or any other safety critical task. = Target groups = Ships’ officers, engineers, pilots and shore-based personnel. = Objectives of training = To motivate the team – if necessary – to change its behaviour to good resource management practices during everyday operations. This includes understanding of the importance of good management and teamwork and the willingness to change behaviour. An overall objective is to increase safety, efficiency and job satisfaction in shipping companies and, eventually, in the maritime industry as a whole. = Technical vs. non-technical training = During everyday operation on board a ship, technical and non-technical skills are integrated into each other and both skills needed to perform tasks as safely and efficiently as possible. The technical skills are related to a specific department, job, function, rank or task. These are the skills traditionally focused on in the maritime industry and what has since long been covered in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). MRM is human factors training. This kind of training is sometimes referred to as soft skills training or non-technical training and was through the Manila Amendments introduced in the STCW. As opposed to technical training, non- technical training is generic, i.e. applicable to all. While most technical training has to be carried out with groups kept apart – divided into, for example, deck and engine – the non-technical training may be carried out with no separation of people at all. According to the MRM training concept, MRM training should be carried out as a separate training course without mixing it with technical issues. The purpose is to bring disciplines and ranks together in the same training class, providing them with the same course contents, terminology and training objectives. The aim is to tear down barriers between people, departments, ship and shore, open up for efficient communication and establish a genuine safety culture within the whole organisation. = Development = The MRM training concept is developed from similar type of training carried out in the aviation industry. An important event that triggered resource management training in aviation was the Tenerife airport disaster - a collision on the runway of the Los Rodeos Airport on the island of Tenerife on 27 March 1977 between two Boeing 747 airliners. The accident resulted in the highest number of fatalities in aviation history – 583 people lost their lives. Contributing causes of this accident were; fog, stress, communication misunderstandings and a lack of monitoring and challenging errors. Resource Management training in the United States are usually traced back to 1979 when a workshop sponsored by NASA, Resource Management on the Flightdeck, took place. This workshop was the result of NASA research into the causes of air transport accidents. Research presented at the workshop identified the human error aspects of the majority of air crashes as failures of interpersonal communications, decision making, and leadership. At this meeting, the label Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) was applied to the training of aircraft crews aiming at reducing pilot error. In the beginning of the 1990s, eight entities gathered with the objective of converting the airline industry's Cockpit Resource Management course to a course aimed at the maritime industry. These entities were: * Dutch Maritime Pilots’ Corporation * Finnish Maritime Administration * Norwegian Shipowners’ Association * SAS Flight Academy * Silja Line * Swedish Maritime Administration * Swedish Shipowners’ Association * The Swedish Club The first course, which was launched in June 1993, was called Bridge Resource Management, or BRM, because it was believed to be the most accurate translation of Cockpit Resource Management. \\"The cockpit onboard a ship ought to be the bridge.\\" In 2003 the name of the course was changed from Bridge Resource Management to Maritime Resource Management. The main purpose was to increase attraction amongst other important target groups besides masters, bridge officers and maritime pilots. Such target groups included engineers and shore-based personnel. Before that, the aviation industry had changed the meaning of CRM from Cockpit Resource Management to Crew Resource Management. As of 2013, the further development of the Maritime Resource Management (MRM)™ training programme is assumed by the independent training development company ALL Academy International ABhttp://allacademy.com with the purpose of reaching out to an even wider audience, inside and outside of the maritime industry. = Different course labels = Since the launch of resource management training in the maritime industry, courses have emerged with similar names. Such names are Bridge Resource Management (BRM), Engine-room Resource Management (ERM), Vessel Resource Management (VRM), Crew Resource Management (CRM), Maritime Crew Resource Management (MCRM), etc.  Concerns  Due to the lack of a uniform standard in the maritime industry, contents, concept and quality of training of these courses differ. A consequence could be that the initial objectives concerning safety improvements will not be met. In some courses the focus is more on technical issues than on non-technical issues which was not the intention when resource management training was first introduced in the maritime industry. Resource management training is sometimes also confused with Bridge Team Management (BTM) training which usually is a technical skills training course aimed at the deck department.  Focus of training  Training of seafarers are regulated through the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). The STCW training requirements concern the seafarers, the people at the sharp end. At the sharp end we find the frontline operators, the people actually doing the task. The blunt end is further away from the action itself. The blunt end is the environment in which the seafarers work. Regulators, designers, shore-side owners and managers function at the blunt end. = Active errors and latent errors = Active errors occur at the sharp end of the process. The effect of active errors are felt almost immediately. Active errors could be; making a course change at the wrong position, pushing an incorrect button, forgetting to close a valve. Latent errors occur at the blunt end. These are errors, removed in both time and space from the operators at the sharp end, that may lie dormant within the system for a long time. Examples of latent errors may include; equipment design flaws that make the human-machine interface less than intuitive, or organizational flaws, such as staffing and training decisions made for fiscal reasons increasing the likelihood of errors. Latent errors are often unrecognized and have the capacity to result in multiple types of active errors. Analyses of major accidents involving many different areas of society indicate that latent errors pose the greatest risk to safety in a complex system. Such accidents include Three Mile Island accident, Heysel Stadium disaster, Bhopal disaster, Chernobyl disaster, Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, King's Cross fire, Piper Alpha and MS Herald of Free Enterprise. = Just culture = The culture of the maritime industry has traditionally been characterised as a blame culture where seafarers risk not only dismissal but also criminal prosecution for being involved in accidents. Recent examples of such accidents are the MV Erika and Hebei Spirit, where the blame was placed on the ship's Master, visa a vis the company / system. To increase safety and facilitate the reporting and sharing of safety data, as required by the International Safery Management (ISM) Code, the industry has identified a need to move towards a no blame culture or a just culture. The just culture term has gained in popularity since no blame may be seen as not accountable. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has defined just culture as; \\"A culture in which frontline operators or others are not punished for actions, omissions or decisions taken by them that are commensurate with their experience and training, but where gross negligence, wilful violations and destructive acts are not tolerated.\\" The target groups and objectives of MRM training extend beyond the requirements of the STCW Convention. MRM training focuses on both active and latent errors and has as an objective to establish a just culture across the maritime industry. Shore- side managers, accident investigators and regulators are therefore important target groups for MRM training.  Training providers  MRM training providers include maritime universities and training centres, ship owners and ship managers, manning agencies, pilot associations and seafarer associations.  Training method  = Workshops = The learning process in the MRM course takes place in workshops, one workshop per course module. In the workshops, conducted by a specially trained workshop leader, the trainees work together with 8-12 other trainees, sometimes in smaller groups. Case studies and situation analysis are performed, during which comparison between others’ and own attitudes and opinions are made. The MRM course is rather increasing the tendency, or willingness, to apply the skills than teaching the skills. This is a matter of changing attitudes. = Computer-based training = As a preparation for each workshop, the trainee learns basic facts about human behaviour and interaction. This is done by means of computer-based training, or CBT. The CBT program also contains scripted drama examples of good and bad management situations. The CBT is carried out individually or in group. = Case studies = An important part of the course is case studies of real accidents and incidents with analysis using MRM terminology. = Facilitation techniques = Instruction and facilitation are two main techniques that are available to trainers. Instruction is primarily a telling activity, where knowledge and skills are developed in trainees through either direct communication or demonstration. Facilitation on the other hand, can be described as a technique that helps trainees to discover for themselves what is appropriate and effective. Both techniques are useful and have their place. In order to transfer knowledge, instruction is the most efficient technique to employ. However, trying to encourage appropriate attitudes using instruction as the technique, normally has limited success. People, particularly adults, do not like being told how to behave and what to think. In MRM training, facilitation is the technique primarily used. = Refresher training = Refresher training is considered a critical success factor for long-lasting results from resource management training. In the maritime industry this is most often done through shorter courses summarising the core MRM modules - focusing on recently added course material and analyses of recent accident cases. Shipping companies also refresh MRM contents during officer and crew conferences and in the daily communication with the ships.  STCW Manila Amendments  Major revisions to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (the STCW Convention), and its associated Code were adopted at a Diplomatic Conference in Manila, the Philippines, on 21–25 June 2010. The amendments, to be known as “The Manila amendments to the STCW Convention and Code” entered into force on 1 January 2012 with full compliance by 1 January 2017. Amongst the amendments adopted, there are a number of important changes to the Convention and Code. The sections of the STCW Manila Amendments that contain requirements related to non-technical skills are: * Reg. A-II/1 for Bridge Resource Management * Reg. A-III/1 for Engine-room Resource Management * Reg. A-II/2 and A-III/2 for Use Leadership and Managerial Skills * Reg. A-II/1, A-III/1 and A-III/6 for Application of Leadership and Teamworking Skills On 14 February 2012, the Maritime Department of the Swedish Transport Agency certified that the MRM course meets the above-mentioned requirements of the STCW 1978 Convention as amended by the 2010 Manila Amendments.

It is projected that by the year 2020, about 25% of the U.S. workforce will be composed of older workers (ages 55 and over). While many factors contribute to the aging workforce, the Post-World War II baby boom created an unusually large birth cohort for the U.S. population, resulting in a large aging population today. This phenomenon has many short-term and long-term implications, affecting many areas, including the U.S. economy, society and public health. Baby boom CDC Bottom of this page https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus.htm \\"Vital Statistics of the United States, 2003, Volume I, Natality\\", Table 1-1 \\"Live births, birth rates, and fertility rates, by race: United States, 1909–2003.\\" Starting in the years following World War II, from 1946 to 1964, about 76 million people were born in the United States, creating a large birth cohort known as the Baby boomers. Projections According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of April 2014, the labor force participation rate was 62.8%. The overall labor force participation rate is expected to decline for the remainder of the decade, projected to fall to 62.5% in 2020. By the year 2020, the subpopulation of older adults in the United States is expected to reach 97.8 million people, comprising 28.7% percent of the entire U.S. population, a rise from the 24.7% in 2010. This increase in proportion of older adults can be attributed to the entire Baby Boomer cohort joining the older adult population (ages 55+) by 2020. It is projected that by 2020, the proportion of the U.S. labor force that is composed of older adults will be 25.2%. This continues a trend in increasing rates of older adults remaining in the workforce, as the rates were 13.1% in 2000 and 19.5% in 2010. A complementary trend that follows this is the increasing median age of the U.S. workforce. By 2020, the workforce is expected to have a median age of 42.8, which will be an increase from 39.3 in 2000 and 41.7 in 2010. A further factor contributing to an aging workforce is the fact that employment rates among older workers are increasing. The rate of people who continue working after they are 65 is relatively high in the US, when compared to other developed countries. For example, in 2011, 16.7% among people aged 65 and over and 29.9% among 65–69 were employed in the US. Impacts With continuing trends of an aging American workforce and a declining labor force participation rate, there may be many consequences arising from this phenomenon. The impending repercussions from a large aging workforce entering retirement has led some to call this situation \\"The Silver Tsunami\\", although this metaphorical phrase has been controversial due to its ageist connotations. =Economy= Due to a declining labor participation rate, there is expected to be a shortage of workers in the U.S. workforce. Projections show that the demand for labor needed now is not being fulfilled, and the gap between labor needed and labor available will continue to expand over the future. Owing to the differences in population size between the Baby Boomers and the following younger generations, there has been negative growth in the working age population. The baby \\"busters\\", also known as generation X, are not as plentiful as the baby boomer generation. They are spending more time educating themselves and training and are entering the workforce at a later age. Therefore, there are fewer and fewer entering the workforce in their early twenties. Baby boomers retiring, means fewer working people and reduces productivity rates in the workforce. The workforce is also losing those skilled enough to do the jobs we have now. A loss in skilled and capable workers has made it harder for employers to recruit new staff. The retirement of members of the aging workforce could possibly result in the shortage of skilled labor in the future. A majority of experienced utility workers and hospital caregivers, for example, will be eligible for retirement. =Social security benefits= The U.S. federal social security system functions through the taxation of large numbers of young workers, in order to support smaller numbers of older dependents. A diminishing workforce, coupled with growing numbers of longer- living elderly can deplete the social security system. The Social Security Administration estimates that the old age dependency ratio (people ages 65+ divided by people ages 20–64) in 2080 will be over 40%, compared to the 20% old age dependency ratio in 2005. Increasing life expectancies of the older population will not only result in decreases in Social Security Benefits, but also devalues private and public pension programs. The death of funds supplying programs such as social security and Medicare may be a contributing factor for adults to delay retirement and to continue working. =Occupational safety and health= Because of the many older adults opting to remain in the U.S. workforce, many studies have been done to investigate whether the older workers are at greater risk of occupational injury than their younger counterparts. Due to the physical declines associated with aging, older adults tend to exhibit losses in eyesight, hearing and physical strength. Data shows that older adults have low overall injury rates compared to all age groups, but are more likely to suffer from fatal and more severe occupational injuries. Of all fatal occupational injuries in 2005, older workers accounted for 26.4%, despite only comprising 16.4% of the workforce at the time. Age increases in fatality rates in occupational injury are more pronounced for workers over the age of 65. The return to work for older workers is also extended; older workers experience a greater median number of lost work days and longer recovery times than younger workers. Some common occupational injuries and illnesses for older workers include arthritis and fractures. Among older workers, hip fractures are a large concern, given the severity of these injuries. =Health care= With larger numbers of older adults, there will be an increased need for geriatric care. Older adults will have to deal with more chronic diseases; older adults who have worked in the construction industry have shown high rates of chronic diseases. Experts suggest that the number of geriatricians will have to triple to meet the demands of the rising elderly. There is expected to be a similarly increased demand in other healthcare professionals, such as nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists and dentists. In addition, there is expected to be an increasing demand over common geriatric care consumption needs, such as medications, joint replacements and cardiovascular operations. =Society= Population aging can potentially change American society as a whole. Many companies use an antiquated system, in which older, tenured workers get raises and benefits over time, eventually hitting retirement. With larger numbers of older workers in the workforce, this model is possibly unsustainable. In addition, perceptions of older adults in society will change, as the elderly are living longer lives and more active than before. A University of Alabama at Birmingham article stated that society faces a cultural ageism in the perceptions about older adults, which will change over time.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Padres, Seattle Mariners, and Miami Marlins. Early life and career Capps warms up in the bullpen in Oakland, California, April 2013. Capps was a backup catcher at North Lenoir High School. He was converted to a pitcher in his freshman year at Mount Olive College. He posted a 24–1 win–loss record after two years (including an NCAA Division II-record of 24 straight wins) and pitched in the Cape Cod League as a relief pitcher for the Harwich Mariners in 2011. He earned attention for a three-inning, five-strikeout performance on July 13, 2010, against Team USA's collegiate all-star team. Professional career =Seattle Mariners= Capps was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the third round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft out of Mount Olive. After a poor 2011 debut with the Clinton LumberKings of the Class A Midwest League, in which he had a 1–1 record and a 6.00 earned run average (ERA) in 18 innings, Capps improved dramatically with his performance as the closer for the Jackson Generals of the Class AA Southern League in 2012. Before being promoted to the Tacoma Rainiers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League Capps struck out 72 hitters in 50 innings and posted 19 saves, along with a 1.26 ERA. He pitched only innings in AAA. For his performance with the Generals, Capps was named the best relief pitcher in the Southern League in 2012. Capps was called up to the majors for the first time on July 31, 2012. He made his major league debut against the New York Yankees on August 3. His first recorded out was against Derek Jeter. Capps was recalled by the Mariners on August 6, 2013. =Miami Marlins= On December 13, 2013, the Mariners traded Capps to the Miami Marlins for Logan Morrison. In 2015, Capps pitched to a 1.16 ERA. On March 8, 2016 in Gulf Breeze, Florida, Dr. James Andrews performed Tommy John surgery on Capps, ruling him out for the 2016 season. Capps had entered spring training expecting to compete with A. J. Ramos for the role of Marlins closer. =San Diego Padres= On July 29, 2016, the Marlins traded Capps, Josh Naylor, Jarred Cosart, and Luis Castillo to the San Diego Padres for Andrew Cashner, Colin Rea, Tayron Guerrero, and cash considerations. Capps began the 2017 season on the disabled list, to continue rehabbing from his previous Tommy John surgery. He was outrighted to Triple-A on March 26, 2018. Capps declared free agency on October 9, 2018. =Pitching style= Although his four-seam fastball was in the low 90s as a starter in college, it averages 99 mph out of the bullpen now, as-well at times 100-101 MPH. He pairs the hard fastball with a sweeping curveball at 81–85 mph and an occasional changeup against left-handed hitters. With his tall frame, Capps releases the ball at a low three-quarters arm angle far to the side of the pitching rubber, making it difficult for right-handed hitters to pick up the ball out of his hand. He is notable for having a unique leaping hitch in his delivery, which has been described as a \\"slide skip\\", a \\"hop-step\\", and a \\"crow-hop\\". The delivery shortens the distance between him and the batter before he releases the ball. The delivery was reviewed by MLB and deemed legal, despite a rule change concerning pitching before the 2017 season.

History =Formation= No. 26 Squadron was formed on 1 January 1968 at Adampur, under Wing Commander M.M. Singh. It was the first squadron to operate the Sukhoi Su-7 aircraft. Until 1971, the squadron was a type-training squadron, helping other squadrons to convert to the Su-7. It played an active role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. No. 26 Squadron's primary role was to fly Close Air Support (CAS) missions with 8 Tactical Air Command (TAC). It also flew several sorties with 6 TAC. Most operations were in an area known as the Bulge, bounded by Samba in the north, Pathankot in the east, and Dera Baba Nanak in the south. =1971 Indo- Pakistani War= The aircrew of No. 26 Squadron were briefed for operations at 04:00 hours on the morning of 4 December 1971, as part of India's response to a series of pre-emptive strikes on Indian airfields by the Pakistani Air Force (PAF). Among its sorties, No. 26 Squadron sent four aircraft to strike Chandhar Air Force Base early that morning. At dusk, four aircraft were sent to strike a suspected radar site at Walton Airfield. On 5 December, after a briefing at 04:30 hours, the squadron flew missions for 6 TAC in the Lahore sector. Squadron Leader Sahin took damage on one sortie, forcing him to land at Pathankot. During the last strike of the day, Squadron Leader Jaffa was shot down. He ejected from an inverted aircraft, but landed inside Pakistani territory and was captured. On 6 December, the squadron flew several missions against dug-in and well-prepared Pakistani positions in the Bulge. On 7 December, Squadron Leader Jiwa Singh, the squadron's Senior Flight Commander, was shot down over Jafarwal at 10:15 hours, and lost contact with ground control. Later that day, it was reported that an Su-7, probably commanded by Singh, had been shot down by an F-104 Starfighter and the pilot killed. On 8 December, after a briefing at 06:30 hours, No. 26 Squadron flew several CAS missions with no losses. But losses over the preceding days had reduced the squadron to 13 pilots and just 11 aircraft. On 9 December, No. 26 Squadron began flying missions with MiG 21 escorts, in response to increased PAF activity in the Bulge. The squadron flew several missions against Pakistani positions in the Bulge. Flight Lieutenant (Flt Lt) Kadam was reported missing after an attack on Rissalwala Airfield.

The episode was written by series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost, and directed by Duwayne Dunham. \\"Episode 1\\" features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, and Richard Beymer. Dunham was offered the role of directing the episode by Lynch, who wanted Dunham to edit his next film project, Wild at Heart (1990). Dunham continued to use several stylistic elements in his direction that he had observed in Lynch's work on \\"Pilot\\", including largely static camera work and the use of reddish color tints. The episode also marks the first appearance of Killer Bob, who was played by set decorator Frank Silva after Silva had been accidentally caught on camera. \\"Episode 1\\" continued the investigation of the series' main plotline, the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), with Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) interviewing several suspects connected to the victim. The episode was viewed by approximately 14.9 million households upon its initial airing, which represented over a quarter of the available audience. Since its broadcast, the episode has earned positive reviews from critics. Plot =Background= The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her classmate Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has come to the town to investigate, and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs, James Hurley (James Marshall). =Events= Cooper takes breakfast at the Great Northern Hotel, enjoying a \\"damn fine cup of coffee\\" as Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) introduces herself and begins flirting with him. He makes his way to the sheriff's department, where he and Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean) discuss the day's plans. They interview Dr Hayward (Warren Frost) who has had an autopsy conducted on Palmer's body. They learn that Laura had had sex with at least three men the night she died. Waitress Shelley Johnson (Mädchen Amick) is about to leave for work when her abusive husband Leo (Eric Da Re) demands she do more laundry. She finds a bloodstained shirt among Leo's clothes and hides it before he notices. However, he later realizes that it has gone missing. When she returns home that night, he questions her about its whereabouts, and savagely beats her with a bar of soap in a sock. Cooper interviews Hurley about a video of Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hurley had denied him being present the day it was taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who is on his way to aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley. The scene fade cuts into a short clip from the VHS tape of Palmer dancing outdoors, and pauses on a close up of her face. The words \\"Help Me\\" can be heard. Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discuss Packard's trouble with her sister-in-law Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie). Truman and Cooper arrive to speak with Packard, who had employed Palmer as an English tutor. Packard admits to sensing that Palmer was troubled but cannot help further; Cooper picks up on the fact that Truman has been having a relationship with Packard. Catherine calls Packard to tell her that the latter's sawmill lost $87,000 the day before; Catherine is having an affair with Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), with whom she is conspiring a hostile takeover of the mill. That same day, Hayward visits Palmer's mother Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), attempting to console her. However, Sarah has a vision of a sinister man (Frank Silva) crouching in the corner of the room, and panics. Meanwhile, Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Laura's psychiatrist, listens to an audio tape she had made for him, and sobs as he toys with half of a golden heart necklace, the other half of which was found at the scene of the crime. Production \\"Episode 1\\" was written by the series creators David Lynch and Mark Frost. The pair had co-written \\"Pilot\\", and would also write \\"Episode 2\\" together. Frost would pen a further eight scripts for the series after that, while Lynch would write just one episode—the second season opening installment, \\"Episode 8\\". The episode was the first in the series to be directed by Duwayne Dunham, who would return to helm two further installments in the series' second season. The episode features the first appearance of Frank Silva as Killer Bob, though the character is not yet identified at this point. Silva was the art director for the series, and had accidentally been caught on camera during a shot. Lynch was pleased with the result and decided to include Silva in the cast from then on.Dunham, 32:02–32:38 Dunham had first met Lynch when he worked as the film editor for Lynch's 1986 film Blue Velvet.Dunham, 01:55–02:26 Dunham then edited \\"Pilot\\", and was about to look for another editing job elsewhere when he asked Lynch if the director had another film planned; a week later Lynch decided to film Wild at Heart and asked Dunham to edit that as well.Dunham, 02:45–03:36 However, Dunham had committed to another project and felt uncomfortable leaving one editing job for another; Lynch then offered him a directing position on Twin Peaks in the interim to justify cancelling his other project.Dunham, 03:37–04:23 Dunham finished principal photography on \\"Episode 1\\" the same day that Lynch finished filming \\"Wild at Heart\\".Dunham, 08:59–09:08 The introduction of a sexual rapport between the characters of Audrey Horne and Dale Cooper was a suggestion of Dunham's, who felt it would benefit both characters. Dunham felt that the central mystery in the series—the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer—was simply a \\"MacGuffin\\" to compel what he saw as the real focus, the interaction of the large ensemble cast. As such, he took care to introduce meaningful interactions between characters wherever possible.Dunham, 05:02–06:47 Dunham also spent time with each of the cast to help them develop their characters, having studied the scripts involved and basing his take on the characters on his experience with \\"Pilot\\".Dunham, 12:29–13:13 Dunham retained the frequent use of static cameras seen in \\"Pilot\\", something he saw as a hallmark of Lynch's directing style;Dunham, 10:01–10:28 describing the result as \\"like framed pictures\\".Dunham, 10:38–10:40 He also continued the use of a \\"warm\\" reddish tint to the footage, using soft coral filters and carefully selected props and costumes to obtain this coloring.Dunham, 19:40–20:18 This tint was considered important enough that Lynch sent a representative to the network to ensure they understood it was deliberate and not a mistake, for fear that they might correct the saturation to be more \\"realistic\\" before broadcasting it.Dunham, 22:01–22:36 Broadcast and reception \\"Episode 1\\" was first broadcast on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on April 12, 1990. Upon its initial airing, it was seen by households, or of the available audience. It placed second in its timeslot after Cheers. This marked a decline from \\"Pilot\\", which attracted of the available audience. The following episode would be viewed by of the available audience, representing a further drop in numbers. Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps awarded the episode an \\"A−\\" rating. He felt that the scene showing Leo Johnson domestically abusing his wife was \\"among the show's most disturbing moments\\", comparing it to a scene from the 1990 film The Grifters. Phipps also felt the sound design in the episode was impressive, commenting positively on the blurred distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic music. Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five. Television Without Pity's Daniel J. Blau felt that the episode showed series composer Angelo Badalamenti to have limited range, repeating several similar musical cues throughout. He also considered Eric Da Re's performance as Leo Johnson to be unconvincing, finding it difficult to believe that the character was as feared and menacing as was implied. However, Blau described the introduction of Killer Bob as still seeming powerful and frightening even several years after first being seen, considering it a potent and disturbing scene.

The episode was written by Harley Peyton, and directed by Tina Rathborne. \\"Episode 3\\" features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean and Ray Wise, and introduces Sheryl Lee's second role, Maddy Ferguson. Rathborne has highlighted the episode's introduction of Jungian analytical psychology to the series. She also described MacLachlan's character Dale Cooper as not only a wholesome, grounded anchor against which the series' more bizarre elements could be contrasted; but as the central component of the series' coming-of-age \\"Bildungsroman\\" narrative. \\"Episode 3\\" was first broadcast on April 26, 1990, and was viewed by approximately 18 percent of the available audience in its initial airing. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with its mix of comedy and tragedy seen as a highlight, and Miguel Ferrer's character Albert Rosenfield singled out as a particularly successful example of this. The episode also drew praise from The New York Times for its compelling and unusual cast of characters. Plot =Background= The small town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has come to the town to investigate, and initial suspicion has fallen upon Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and the man with whom she was cheating on Briggs, James Hurley (James Marshall). However, other inhabitants of the town have their own suspicions: the violent, drug-dealing truck driver Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re) is seen as a possible suspect. Cooper experiences a surreal dream in which a dwarf and a woman resembling Laura reveal the identity of the killer. =Events= Cooper and Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) share breakfast, as he realizes she had slipped a note under his hotel room door; the note referred to One-Eyed Jacks, a brothel over the Canada–US border. When she leaves, Cooper discusses his dream with Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), believing it to be a coded solution to the murder. Cooper's colleague, Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) wishes to conduct a further post-mortem on Laura's body, but it is due to be released for the funeral that day. As the argument grows more heated, Truman ends it by punching Rosenfield and knocking him down. Later, Rosenfield shares what he has found; Laura had been bound when she was killed, had been addicted to cocaine, and had been clawed by a bird. An unidentified plastic shard was also found in her stomach. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) is at home when he is visited by his niece, Madeline Ferguson (Lee). Ferguson is identical to Laura save for having black hair, not blonde. At the same time, Cooper and Truman question Johnson about Laura's death, believing him to be lying when he denies knowing her. Later, Hurley arrives at Laura's funeral late, watching from a distance. Briggs begins to accost the mourners, accusing them of doing nothing when they knew Laura had been troubled. Hurley intervenes and the two begin fighting; Leland falls on the casket as it is being lowered into the grave, sobbing uncontrollably. That night, Cooper, Truman, Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) and Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) meet at the RR Diner. Truman explains that someone has been smuggling cocaine into town; he suspects that Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz), bartender at the town's Roadhouse Bar, is involved. He also explains that the woods around the town seem to contain a \\"darkness\\", and reveals that there is a secret society of men gathered to stand watch against this: the Bookhouse Boys. Truman and the others bring Cooper to their headquarters, where James has Jacques' brother Bernard (Clay Wilcox) bound and gagged. They question Bernard but he denies any crime. Elsewhere, Jacques realizes his brother is in trouble, and calls Johnson for help. When Johnson leaves, his abused wife Shelley (Mädchen Amick) hides a gun in a secret drawer. Meanwhile, sawmill owner Josie Packard (Joan Chen) tells Truman, her lover, that her sister-in-law Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) is scheming to take over the mill. Packard knows there are two account books, one fake and one real, but cannot locate the real one Martell has been hiding. Production The episode opens with a shot of Sherilyn Fenn, who director Tina Rathborne compared to Marilyn Monroe (pictured 1959). \\"Episode 3\\" was the first of the series to be written by Harley Peyton; Peyton returned to pen a number of other episodes across both seasons. The episode was directed by Tina Rathborne, who would also go on to helm \\"Episode 17\\" in the second season. Rathborne had previously worked with series co-creator David Lynch when she had cast him in her 1988 feature film Zelly and Me.Rathborne, 00:11–00:15 The episode introduces the character of Maddy Ferguson, Laura's nearly identical cousin, the second role in the series played by Sheryl Lee. Lee had been a stage actor living in Washington, where \\"Pilot\\" was filmed, and had remained there after production moved to Los Angeles as she believed that, with her character dead, she would have no further part in the series. However, Lynch was impressed with her performance and called to ask her to return, telling her he would \\"figure [...] out\\" a way for her to continue appearing. Rathborne chose to open the episode with a shot centered on Sherilyn Fenn, finding the actress to be \\"seductive\\" and \\"absorbing\\" in a similar manner to screen icon Marilyn Monroe.Rathborne, 03:01–03:37 Rathborne had initially worried that the episode featured too many static scenes of characters sitting and talking, with little action, and asked Lynch if she could borrow some of the imagery of the previous episode's surreal dream sequence to keep these conversations more interesting, adding brief snippets of footage as Cooper discussed the dream with the others.Rathborne, 05:31–06:14 Rathborne has noted that this dream- centric approach to the character of Cooper is rooted in Carl Jung's theories of analytical psychology.Rathborne, 06:42–07:06 She felt this was something that had not been seen on television before, and credits Lynch with introducing it to the series.Rathborne, 07:07–07:28 She has also described the narrative, both of \\"Episode 3\\" and of Twin Peaks as a whole, as a \\"Bildungsroman\\" showing Cooper's development into a more rounded and enlightened person.Rathborne, 11:20–11:42 Working on studio sets was a new experience for Rathborne, whose previous work had all been filmed on location.Rathborne, 08:20–08:41 She also found it refreshing to work with the series' ensemble cast, recalling that Miguel Ferrer often had the cast and crew laughing at the way he approached his material, imbuing the atmosphere during filming with a mix of comedy and drama.Rathborne, 09:06–09:36 Rathborne has also noted the use of ordinary, almost banal, daily life in the series, finding it a necessary element to be able to play the series' more violent and surreal elements against effectively. She particularly singled out Cooper as a wholesome \\"boy next door\\" character who allowed the town's more unusual residents to stand out more starkly.Rathborne, 22:01–23:26 Broadcast and reception \\"Episode 3\\" was first broadcast by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on April 19, 1990. In its initial airing, it was viewed by of US households, representing of the available audience. This marked a slight decline from the previous episode, which had attracted of the population and of the available audience. The A.V. Club Keith Phipps rated the episode a B+, finding that it struggled to live up to the preceding episode; however, he felt that this was understandable, as \\"after pushing television to the limits of sanity there was nowhere to go but back\\". Phipps also described the funeral scene as a highlight of the episode, finding that he grew to appreciate its mix of tragic and comic more over repeated viewings. Writing for Allrovi, Andrea LeVasseur rated the episode four stars out of five. John J. O'Connor, writing for The New York Times praised the episode, stating that it features \\"the most bizarrely compelling collection of characters ever to hit prime time\\". O'Connor spoke positively of the intricate plot seen in the episode and the series as a whole, noting that \\"the overall narrative is paramount\\" and affirming his belief that the series \\"seems to have been mapped out carefully\\" by Lynch and Frost. Television Without Pity's Daniel J. Blau praised the episode's black humour, singling out in particular the scene in which Ferrer's character is punched after an argument in the town morgue. However, Blau was critical of guest stars Olkewicz and Wilcox, finding their attempted French- Canadian accents particularly poor. Writing for Digital Spy, Tony Delgado has also praised Ferrer's role as Rosenfield, adding that his dialogue \\"may not appear to be the epitome of wit, but the way [Ferrer] delivered such lines caused plenty of howling hysterics in living rooms across the globe\\".

He was in his third year as a student at the School of Economics at Latakia Tishreen University, when the Syrian Uprising against the government of Bashar al-Assad erupted in March 2011. According to his biography at Free Syrian Translators website, Anas played a leading role in stimulating the protests that called for democracy and for the toppling of al-Assad's government in the city of Banyas, which is considered the second city to rebel in Syria after Daraa. Anas had also played an important role in the media coverage of the uprising. He was one of the first Syrian activists inside the country to speak to the Media using his real name. It is also important to mention that Banyas was the first city to broadcast its demonstrations live to the news media. Anas was arrested on May 14, 2011 when the Syrian army and the security forces along with the Shabbiha stormed the city of Banyas. Dunia TV (which is very close to the Syrian government) announced that the reason behind Anas' arrest is his alleged involvement in an attempt to establish an Islamic State and his appointment as the \\"Minister of Interior\\" in this alleged state. The fate of Anas and his whereabouts are not yet known. It is not affirmed whether he has died at some detention center that belongs to one of the various Intelligence agencies in Syria or he is still alive. What is certain, though, is that he became one of the icons of the Syrian revolution against Bashar al-Assad.

It refines the genus but may be coarser than proper equivalence Definitions We define two Z-lattices L and M in a quadratic space V over Q to be spinor equivalent if there exists a transformation g in the proper orthogonal group O+(V) and for every prime p there exists a local transformation fp of Vp of spinor norm 1 such that M = g fpLp. A spinor genus is an equivalence class for this equivalence relation. Properly equivalent lattices are in the same spinor genus, and lattices in the same spinor genus are in the same genus.

A statue of Skanderbeg was installed in 2006 and the square underwent a refurbishment that began on 17 January 2012 and was completed in segments between 2014-2018. The total cost for the square is estimated at around 10 million euros. The square covers 28,000 m2 (301,389 ft2) and extends from the Macedonian Philharmonic and Macedonian Opera to the Old Bazaar of Skopje. During the refurbishment process a portion of the square was built on top of Goce Delčev Boulevard. Aside from plenty of open space, the square contains an amphitheatre, a fountain, underground parking and murals depicting important figures and scenes from Albanian history. An equestrian statue of Skanderbeg, a medieval Albanian who fought against Ottoman forces, is located within Skanderbeg Square and symbolically serves to delineate the space for ethnic Albanians. The bronze statue is seven meters high with Skanderbeg depicted with a deep gaze sitting upright on a horse with his right hand raised and sword placed in its sheath. The Skanderbeg statue of Skopje shares a similar socialist aesthetic and equestrian posture with minor differences in detail to existing Skanderbeg monuments in Tirana, Prishtina and other places in Europe. Albanians use Skanderbeg Square to organise large gatherings that celebrate sporting or cultural and political events such as dates significant to the present and past of the Albanians.  History  =Proposal and initial planning = Bilingual sign designating Skanderbeg Square In 2005 the 600th birthday of Skanderbeg was commemorated within the Balkans in Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia through academic conferences and other celebrations. Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) politician Mayor Izet Mexhiti of Čair municipality made an announcement on 22 November 2005 that the municipal council had approved to construct a Skanderbeg monument by the entrance of the Old Bazaar. The move was controversial and contested by the Heritage Protection director on grounds that the proposed area was a historical protected location and that such cases needed approval from the Culture Ministry. In early 2006 Skopje City Council asked Čair municipality to cease building on the site as the monument could be interpreted as illegal. Mayor Mexhiti cited that a 2004 decision of Skopje City Council that created a list of figures from history that could be placed within the Skopje. Other reasons given for postponing the project came from the Skopje Department for the Protection of Cultural Heritage which stated that the boundaries of the Old Bazaar were not clearly defined and a law to guard the site needed to be enacted. Mayor Mexhiti used a new legal argument for the monument by referencing the Law on monuments and memorials (2004) that gave Čair municipality full responsibility for issuing the building permit. Thoma Thomai, a sculptor from Albania was selected to design the monument and he was assisted by Edmond Papathimiu on the project. As such the project at the time was viewed by ethnic Macedonians and other minority communities as signifying close connections between Macedonian Albanians and Albania. The decision to construct a Skanderbeg statue at the entrance of the Old Bazaar signified for some people in Macedonia that the area was undergoing a slow Albanisation. Members involved in the project commission took into account Macedonian sensitivities and selected a statue posture of Skanderbeg with sword in sheath and right hand raised to greet people coming into the area to portray an image of peaceful wisdom and not his military prowess. Albanians from other parts of North Macedonia have viewed Albanians in Čair as less authentically Albanian due to living in a more multi-ethnic environment and interaction with ethnic Macedonians. These factors made Čair Albanians participate in the Skanderbeg project to highlight the Albanianess of Skopje. Private funds paid for the Skanderbeg monument. = Construction phase = Skanderbeg's monument and square in the late 2000s The Skanderbeg monument project created the opportunity for local Albanians to connect their experiences with other Albanians within the Balkans and highlight symbolic links which unite them regionally. Once the statue was completed, Ali Ahmeti, the leader of DUI had the Skanderbeg statue travel on a truck from Tiranë to Albanian populated cities such as Debar, Gostivar and Tetovo in the country's west with its final destination point at Skopje. The journey of the statue revisited places in modern North Macedonia associated with various aspects of Skanderbeg's battles. During stopovers the Skanderbeg monument was celebrated and it symbolised a connection between Albanian populated areas. The project also embodied a desire to highlight the input that Albanians in North Macedonia had contributed to Albanian history. Ahmeti, as a politician refrained from hyping his armed combat role during the 2001 conflict and a need arose to highlight his wartime legitimacy due to some Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) and DUI members interpreting his political actions as placating the Macedonians. The Skanderbeg project gave Ahmeti the opportunity to strengthen his public image among Albanians and secure support for his leadership of DUI among its members and supporters along with countering the DPA. Following parliamentary elections in 2006, political wrangling in the country over who would form government with the larger Macedonian parties led to a political spat between two Albanian parties DUI and the DPA. DUI, previously a coalition partner with the Macedonian Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) lost out in the new government coalition composed of the DPA and larger Macedonian VMRO-DPMNE. The rivalry between both Albanian parties played out over the monument for a year as the DPA kept its distance from assisting DUI in finishing the project and claimed they were using Albanian symbols for political gain. During that time the DPA was under pressure to assist Albanians and not let the project fail due to its high symbolism. The impasse was broken on 23 November when the monument was legalised through votes on the Skopje City Council from DUI and its rival the DPA, along with the Macedonian VMRO-DPMNE, while the SDSM voted no. A similar result occurred in Čair Municipality Council with the votes coming from DUI and the SDSM, while most of the DPA counselors were not present and the VMRO-DPMNE voted no. After the Skopje City Council decision was publicised the DPA took credit in the media that they were responsible for a change in policy as they claimed to have swayed their government coalition partner VMRO-DPMNE weeks earlier on the matter. Large mural showing celebrated figures and important scenes from Albanian history. Skanderbeg is figure in centre = Inauguration Ceremony (2006) = In the Balkans, Skopje became the third \\"Albanian\\" capital city after Tiranë and Pristina to install a Skanderbeg statue of similar equestrian features to the others and the act of commemoration by Albanian elites in Macedonia drew upon common Albanian cultural maps, imaginations and symbolism. At the time the Skanderbeg statue was placed in a specific direction with a staring gaze fixated upon the southern areas of the city and the large and visible Millennium Cross on the opposite end of Skopje. The installment of the monument in the middle section of the Ottoman area of Skopje inhabited mainly by Albanians was their effort to mark an Albanian presence within the capital city. Prior to the unveiling ceremony postcards were printed by Čair municipality that hailed the new statue with the words \\"Skenderbeu... edhe në Shkup\\" (Skanderbeg... in Skopje too). Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski (SDSM) along with Mayor Mexhiti privately visited the monument before the unveiling occurred. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski (VMRO-DPMNE) was not present at the unveiling ceremony as DUI officials still reeling over events related to the electoral aftermath made an invitation to him as a private citizen and not a statesman. DPA officials were also not present at the ceremony claiming that DUI was using the event to obscure its inefficiencies toward improving Albanian rights in the country. On 28 November 2006, an equestrian statue of Skanderbeg wrapped with a large Albanian flag was unveiled at the entrance of the Old Bazaar. The ceremony was attended by Western diplomats such as the EU representative and US ambassador, by Daut Haradinaj from Kosovo, the Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration and Albanian politicians from Macedonia that included Ali Ahmeti and Mayor Mexhiti. Also present alongside Ahmeti were other dignitaries such as Fazli Veli, Gëzim Ostreni and Rafiz Aliti associated with the former Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA). Albanian President Alfred Moisiu was not at the ceremony and sent his congratulations to others who were present. The event was choreographed to create a symbolic connection between Ali Ahmeti, a former commander during the 2001 insurgency and Skanderbeg related to standing up for the Albanian cause and its struggles. Ahmeti gave a speech and thanked members of the international community that were present at the ceremony. The speech made references to Albanians in the country, asking them to place differences aside and called for unity within the group declaring that the November event was a \\"victory for all citizens of Macedonia\\".

Three years after the Skanderbeg statue was erected certain views and interpretations of the monument emerged among the public. Of those were claims that the statue was orientated south- west toward Albania as a reminder for Macedonians that local Albanians sought future unification with the Albanian state. Another was that the monument highlighted the religious symbolism of Skanderbeg and represented a re- islamisation of the Albanian population of Skopje contributing to the capital city's political and geographic Muslim-Orthodox divide. Some other Macedonians expressed that the whole affair over the monument was a political ploy as Macedonians have done similar actions with statues in other places within Macedonia. For other Skopje locals the hero status of Skanderbeg is not confined only as being Albanian but also Balkan and European that deserves to be celebrated in relation to his defense of European values and struggle against the Ottomans. In 2007 Skopje Albanians celebrated the independence of Kosovo in Skanderbeg Square with the Albanian and American flags hoisted on the statue. Albanian visitors from within the Balkans and the American and European diaspora come to see the statue and pose in front of it for photos with families and friends. The new monument has also drawn foreigners to the square as another reason to the visit the area of the Old Bazaar with its many shops and Ottoman architecture. = Refurbishment (2010s) = The Macedonian Government initiated a controversial refurbishment project of the capital city named Skopje 2014 and the development of Skanderbeg Square was largely omitted from the project. Čair municipality Mayor Mexhiti responded by announcing their own counterpart to Skopje 2014 with a refurbishment project for Skanderbeg Square located in the Old Bazaar that borders the old town. Plans by ethnic Albanians of Skopje to build a second city square was widely seen at the time as a rival project to the government’s “Skopje 2014” revamp scheme. Funds for the refurbishment of Skanderbeg Square mostly came from the Macedonian Government and were subject to political negotiation between Albanian and Macedonian elites. Among Macedonians and Albanians Skanderbeg Square with its costs and symbols has divided public opinion. Sentiments include Skanderbeg Square being national Albanian pride and symbolism to negative territorial demarcation and nationalism or that funds could have been better spent elsewhere to improve Čair municipal services and infrastructure. Skanderbeg Square has been viewed by many ordinary citizens, politicians and the media as an act of Albanian resistance, part of a symbolic struggle against the government that has been strongly criticised by Macedonians for having an ethno-national focus and supposed vengeful connotation. The Skanderbeg Square project has heightened the demarcation of central Skopje along ethnic lines such as the old town associated with being \\"Albanian territory\\", a process that increased following the conclusion of the 2001 conflict.

King has also written thousands of articles for Australian newspapers and magazines, produced and presented numerous television documentary films, and acted as resident historian on many radio programs. He holds a Ph.D in politics and history from the University of Melbourne.http://www.jonathanking.com.au/Bio.php In 1977, King proposed and organised the First Fleet Re-enactment Voyage to commemorate the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. As the Australian Bicentenary Authority and the Australian government declined to support the project, King set up the voyage as a private venture and obtained corporate sponsorship for the re-eneactment, as well as state government grants and public donations. In October 2002, King attended a conference in Turkey called \\"Australia in Peace and War\\" at which historians discussed Gallipoli and the Anzac legend. As history correspondent for The Australian newspaper, King wrote an article for the paper titled \\"Charge of the rewrite brigade\\", which stated that the conference had concluded that Australians should reframe the Gallipoli Campaign as an \\"unmitigated disaster\\" and apologise to the Turkish government for invading their country. The claims in the article provoked controversy in Australia and New Zealand. Jenny Macleod in her essay \\"Beckham, Waugh and the Memory of Gallipoli\\" in the book New Zealand's Great War asserts that King mis- attributed quotes, and mis-represented the \\"broader political edge\\" of the conference. In April 2018, Fairfax Media published a correction and apology for numerous factual errors published in King's article in Fairfax newspapers about John Monash and the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. King is also an environmental campaigner, having held positions with the Australian Conservation Foundation and running several times for office as a Democrats and Greens candidate.
