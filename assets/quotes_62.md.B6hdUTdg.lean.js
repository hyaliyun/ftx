The city is the most populous metropolis in the district of Vestfold with a population of 52,419 in 2019.\\"Tettsteders befolkning og areal\\" SSB (in Norwegian) Retrieved 3 June 2020. The municipality has a population of 56,293 and covers an area of in 2020. T√∏nsberg is generally regarded as the oldest city in Norway, founded by Vikings in the 9th century. T√∏nsberg was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The rural municipality of Sem was merged into the municipality of T√∏nsberg on 1 January 1988. The neighboring municipality of Re was merged into T√∏nsberg on 1 January 2020. It is home to T√∏nsberg Fortress on Castle Mountain, which includes ruins from Castrum Tunsbergis, Norway's largest castle in the 13th century. An outdoor music festival is held at T√∏nsberg Fortress every July.B√∏rresen, Svein E. (2004). Vestfoldboka: en reise i kultur og natur. Skagerrak forl. Page 55. . T√∏nsberg is also home of Oseberg Mound, where the 9th-century Oseberg Ship was excavated. General information =Name= The Old Norse form of the name was T√∫nsberg. The first element is the genitive case of t√∫n (n), meaning fenced area or garden. The last element is berg (n), meaning mountain. The name originally referred to the fortifications on Slottsfjellet. The old spelling has been retained in the name of the diocese, Tunsberg bisped√∏mme. =Coat of arms= The coat of arms is an old city seal from as far back as 1349. The seal shows T√∏nsberg Fortress surrounded by a ring wall on a mountain with the sea in front. There is also a longship in the water in front of the fortress. Around the seal are the words (in Latin): This is the seal of Tunsberg. History =Viking age= T√∏nsberg Fortress T√∏nsberg Cathedral T√∏nsberg is the oldest city in Norway,Norum, Roger (2011).

Fodor's Travel Publications. Page 283. . The first time the town was mentioned by a contemporary writer was in 1130. According to Snorri Sturluson, T√∏nsberg was founded before the Battle of Hafrsfjord, which, according to Snorri, took place in 871. What year the battle took place is disputed, however, and most current historians believe the battle took place closer to 900. However, if the battle did in fact take place in 871, this would make T√∏nsberg one of the oldest present Scandinavian cities. It was based upon this that the city's 1000 years jubilee was celebrated in 1871, and 1100 years jubilee in 1971. The archaeological excavations conducted in 1987‚Äì88 underneath the monastery ruins revealed several Viking graves which have served to confirm the earlier age of the original settlement. The king or his ombudsman resided in the old Royal Court at S√¶heimr, today the Jarlsberg Manor (Jarlsberg Hovedg√•rd), and on the farm Haugar, (from the Old Norse word haugr meaning hill or burial mound), which can be assumed to have been T√∏nsberg's birthplace. Haugar became the seat for the Haugating, the Thing for Vestfold and Norway's second most important place for the proclamation of kings. The site had probably been named after two Viking Era mounds, which tradition links to two sons of King Harald I, Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf, who was king in Vestfold og Telemark, and his half-brother, Sigr√∏d Haraldsson, king of Trondheim. Both are presumed to have fallen in battle at Haugar against their half-brother Eric Bloodaxe and to have been buried on the same spot. Slottsfjellet (Castle Mountain), north of the city centre, made for a near impregnable natural fortress. During the civil war era of the 12th century, it was fortified by the Baglers. The Birkebeiners besieged it for 20 weeks in the winter of 1201 before the Baglers surrendered. In the 13th century, King Haakon Haakonson set up a castle in T√∏nsberg, T√∏nsberg Fortress. The town was destroyed by fire in 1536, but T√∏nsberg remained one of the most important harbour towns in Norway. James VI of Scotland stopped in T√∏nsberg on his way to meet Anne of Denmark in Oslo, and David Lindsay gave a sermon on 16 November 1589. The event was recorded by a painted inscription in the church, which survives in the museum.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pl. 5. =Whaling epoch= Whale-catchers in T√∏nsberg, 1952 Wider√∏e aerial photography of town, July 1958 The center of the world's modern whaling industry was concentrated in T√∏nsberg and neighboring Sandefjord.T√∏nnessen, Johan Nicolay and Arne Odd Johnsen (1982). The History of Modern Whaling. University of California Press. Page 25. . T√∏nsberg along with neighboring Sandefjord and Larvik were dominant whaling towns in Norway. While whalers from Sandefjord established the first whaling station in the Faroe Islands, whalers from T√∏nsberg initiated whaling in Iceland and the Hebrides.T√∏nnessen, Johan Nicolay and Arne Odd Johnsen (1982). The History of Modern Whaling. University of California Press. Page 84. . During the 1850s, T√∏nsberg turned into a base of operation and source of expertise for whalers in the Arctic- and Antarctic Oceans.Swaney, Deanna (1999). Norway. Lonely Planet. Page 155. . T√∏nsberg has been called ‚Äúthe cradle of modern whaling.T√∏nnessen, Johan Nicolay and Arne Odd Johnsen (1982). The History of Modern Whaling. University of California Press. Page 26. . In the 1892 publication ‚ÄúHandbook for Travellers in Norway‚Äù by John Murray, T√∏nsberg is described as ‚Äúthe centre of the Norwegian whaling and sealing industries in the Arctic Ocean.‚ÄùJohn Murray (1892). Handbook for Travellers in Norway. John Murray. Page 32. The first whaling ventures to Antarctica was led by engineer Henrik Henriksen of T√∏nsberg.Elliot, Gerald (1998). A Whaling Enterprise: Salvesen in the Antarctic. Michael Russell. Page 18. . Henrik Johan Bull was another famous whaler from the district, famous for his expeditions to Antarctica. Bull traveled from Australia to T√∏nsberg in order to learn from local whaler Svend Foyn, who is recognized as the pioneer of the modern whaling industry.Riffenburgh, Beau (2007). Encyclopedia of the Antarctic, Volume 1. Taylor & Francis. Page 677. . One of the city's most prominent residents, Svend Foyn, was a pioneer who embarked on an 1847 expedition to the Arctic, which led to a catch of 6,000 seals. Soon T√∏nsberg Harbor was home to a large fleet of sealing vessels, and the sealing industry grew further after the 1849 repeal of Britain's Navigation Acts. The hunters turned the seals to near extinction in the Arctic Ocean, and therefore turned to Bottle-nosed whales during the 1870s. Norway maintained a monopoly on European whaling until 1883, first and foremost due to Svend Foyn's patent rights to whaling techniques and inventions. Over-hunting in the Arctic eventually drove the whalers to Antarctica. By the beginning of the 20th century, T√∏nsberg had lost its preeminence in the whaling industry to the neighboring city of Sandefjord.T√∏nnessen, Johan Nicolay and Arne Odd Johnsen (1982).

In addition to the Oseberg Ship, Oseberghaugen contained the Oseberg carriage, five beautifully carved bed-posts shaped like animal heads, four sledges, beds, chests, weaving-frames, household utensils and much more. Scientific examinations in 1992 now date the burial to 834 AD, and indicate a probability that it was Queen Alvhild, the first wife of King Gudr√∏d, who was buried here. When unearthed, the ship was buried in blue clay and covered with stones beneath the 6-meter high Oseberg Mound.Evensberget, Snorre (2012). DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Norway. Penguin. Page 85. .

Andebu is home to three Medieval churches. It is home to Norway's oldest parish register, which belongs to Andebu Church and is dated to 1623. Andebu is also the home of H√∏yjord Stave Church, the only stave church in Vestfold County. Andebu was home to 2,160 residents as of 2016.  General information  Andebu's former coat of arms. Andebu has large areas of woodland. The main villages are Andebu, H√∏yjord, and Kodal. The church buildings in all three villages are from the Middle Ages; Kodal Church (Kodal kirke) dates from the 12th century; H√∏yjord Stave Church (H√∏yjord Stavkyrkje) was built around 1150‚Äì1200. = Name = The Old Norse form of the name was Andab√∫.

Vestfoldboka: en reise i kultur og natur. Skagerrak forl. Page 67. . Various historical artifacts and burial mounds dated to the Viking Age have been discovered in Andebu. Finds include a bronze key, a stone axe, arrows, and more. Burial mounds have been discovered on approximately 30 farms in Andebu, including 17 in Andebu proper, 5 in H√∏yjord, and 7 in Kodal. Some mounds are dated back as far as 500 BCE, i.e. over a thousand years prior to the Viking Age. Large amounts of burial mounds are found at Nordre Haugan, Nedre Skjelland, V√•le, Vestre H√∏yjord, Bj√∏rndal, and Gjerstad.Gallis, Arne (1975). Andebu bygdebok: Kulturbind. Andebu kommune. Page 14. The 14th century Black Plague had a devastating impact on Andebu. It is estimated that the population was 600 as of 1600 A.D., approximately the same amount as prior to the plague.Gallis, Arne (1975). Andebu bygdebok: Kulturbind. Andebu kommune. Page 4. Andebu municipality was established on 1 January 1838, with priest Jens H. Otterbeck as its first mayor. Otterbeck served as mayor for 24 years and was the longest-serving mayor of Andebu.  Geography  Town Hall. Andebu lies in the interior central parts of Vestfold County. Most of Andebu is forested, but numerous rivers and mountains can also be found in Andebu. Rivers include Merkedamselva, which flows through eastern parts of H√∏yjord village. Steinselva (Skorgeelva), Bergselva and B√∏levannsbekken are other rivers. Lakes include St√•ler√∏dvannet, Heievannet, Goksj√∏, and others. The highest points of the former municipality are in northwestern parts near the village of H√∏yjord. Some peaks include Br√•nafjell, which is the tallest peak in Sandefjord municipality, as well as √Öletj√∏nn√•sen and Stor√•s. Smaller peaks include Bustingen, Sk√∏rs√•sane, and Stor√•s by Skjeau. The municipality of Andebu was home to 35 lakes, including Askjemvannet (0.37 km2), which was the largest lake in Andebu. Parts of Goksj√∏ Lake was also located in Andebu, while minor lakes are Ilestadvannet and √Öletj√∏nn, both located near the village of H√∏yjord.Gallis, Arne (1975). Andebu bygdebok: Kulturbind. Andebu kommune. Pages 1-3. Br√•nafjell at 399 meters above sea level is the tallest mountain peak in the former municipality of Andebu, and currently the highest peak in Sandefjord municipality. It is located in northernmost Andebu on the border to Re, and just two kilometers from Lardal. Parking for mountain hiking trails can be found by Trollsvann.Larsen, Erlend (2011). P√• Tur i Vestfold del 2. E-forlag. Page 144. .  Andebu Church  Andebu Church (Norwegian: Andebu kirke). Andebu Church (Andebu kirke) dates from ca. 1100. The church was first mentioned in a diploma from 1314. The edifice is of stone and has 300 seats. The soapstone baptismal font is from the 1100s. The altarpiece and the pulpit are in Renaissance style and date from about 1650. The images of the altarpiece shows events from the crucifixion of Jesus. The church was extensively restored in 1686. The ridge turret was destroyed in a storm in 1701 and had to be rebuilt. The two church bells were cast by O. Olsen & Son in 1874. The pipe organ from 1909, was replaced during the 1970s.  Recreation  Kodalveien in the centre of Andebu village. Heisetra is a cabin owned by Sandefjord Tourist Association which lies by Heivannet Lake and Svart√•a River. 100 km of marked hiking trails are located near the cabin. The trails are used by cross-country skiers, bicyclists, hikers, and equestrians.Larsen, Erlend (2010). P√• Tur i Vestfold del 1. E-forlag. Page 20. . Andebu is home to numerous gravel trails, for instance located by Snappen, Trolldalen, and Vidar√•sen.

Two islands were later transferred from the municipality of Stokke to the neighboring municipality of N√∏tter√∏y: H√•√∏ya, (in 1901) and Veierland (in 1964). Relatively few Stokke residents read Sandefjords Blad, the main newspaper of Sandefjord, and few residents reside or work in Sandefjord proper. The wealthiness of Sandefjord, however, was often used as an argument for the merge with Sandefjord. Its international airport Torp was also seen as a deciding factor for Stokke‚Äôs decision to merge into Sandefjord. For the village of Vear, on the other hand, a majority of residents preferred a merge into neighboring T√∏nsberg.

It was part of the newly established Norwegian Coastal Artillery (\\"Kystartilleriet\\"). The fort was erected to keep potential enemies from entering T√∏nsberg by sea, and was also meant to protect the Marine harbor in Melsomvik village. Work on the fort began in 1897, and the forts at both H√•√∏ya Island and Sund√•sen were completed in 1899. Trenches, commando posts, fencing, concrete gun pits, and other remains from the fort can still be seen at Sund√•s.

Stokke municipality had a total area of 118 km2 and had a 14 km coastline along the T√∏nsbergfjord. Stokke is a town and a former municipality located within the municipality of Sandefjord in Vestfold County. The town of Stokke is located in-between the cities of T√∏nsberg and Sandefjord. However, Stokke is primarily a rural community and far smaller than its neighboring cities. It consists of a variety of recreation areas, including the Stor√•s area, which includes lakes, rivers, historic sites, and an abundance of plant- and wildlife species. Another recreational site is located at Bogen, which also includes a beach and an art gallery. Other coastal communities include the villages of Vear, Melsomvik, and Storevar.Bertelsen, Hans Kristian (1998). Bli kjent med Vestfold / Become acquainted with Vestfold. Stavanger Offset AS.

Larson, Wiley J. and James R. Wertz, eds. Space Mission Design and Analysis, 2nd Edition. Published jointly by Microcosm, Inc. (Torrance, CA) and Kluwer Academic Publishers (Dordrecht/Boston/London). 1991. Geosynchronous orbits (GSO) are useful for various civilian and military purposes, but demand a great deal of delta-v to attain. Since, for station-keeping, satellites intended for this orbit typically carry highly efficient but low-thrust engines, total mass delivered to GSO is generally maximized if the launch vehicle provides only the delta-v required to be at high thrust, i.e., to escape Earth's atmosphere and overcome gravitational losses, and the satellite provides the delta-v required to turn the resulting intermediate orbit, which is the GTO, into the useful GSO. Technical description GTO is a highly elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee of , or above sea level, which corresponds to the geostationary altitude. The period of a standard geosynchronous transfer orbit is about 10.5 hours. The argument of perigee is such that apogee occurs on or near the equator. Perigee can be anywhere above the atmosphere, but is usually restricted to a few hundred kilometers above the Earth's surface to reduce launcher delta-V (\\\\Delta V) requirements and to limit the orbital lifetime of the spent booster so as to curtail space junk. If using low-thrust engines such as electrical propulsion to get from the transfer orbit to geostationary orbit, the transfer orbit can be supersynchronous (having an apogee above the final geosynchronous orbit). However, this method takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit. The typical launch vehicle injects the satellite to a supersynchronous orbit having the apogee above 42,164 km. The satellite's low- thrust engines are thrusted continuously around the geostationary transfer orbits in an inertial direction. This inertial direction is set to be in the velocity vector at apogee but with an out-of-plane component. The out-of-plane component removes the initial inclination set by the initial transfer orbit, while the in-plane component raises simultaneously the perigee and lowers the apogee of the intermediate geostationary transfer orbit. In case of using the Hohmann transfer orbit, only a few days are required to reach the geosynchronous orbit. By using low-thrust engines or electrical propulsion, months are required until the satellite reaches its final orbit. The orbital inclination of a GTO is the angle between the orbit plane and the Earth's equatorial plane. It is determined by the latitude of the launch site and the launch azimuth (direction). The inclination and eccentricity must both be reduced to zero to obtain a geostationary orbit. If only the eccentricity of the orbit is reduced to zero, the result may be a geosynchronous orbit but will not be geostationary. Because the \\\\Delta V required for a plane change is proportional to the instantaneous velocity, the inclination and eccentricity are usually changed together in a single maneuver at apogee, where velocity is lowest. The required \\\\Delta V for an inclination change at either the ascending or descending node of the orbit is calculated as follows:Curtis, H. D. (2010) Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students, 2nd Ed. Elsevier, Burlington, MA, pp. 356‚Äì357. :\\\\Delta V = 2 V \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\Delta i}{2}. For a typical GTO with a semi-major axis of 24,582 km, perigee velocity is 9.88 km/s and apogee velocity is 1.64 km/s, clearly making the inclination change far less costly at apogee. In practice, the inclination change is combined with the orbital circularization (or \\"apogee kick\\") burn to reduce the total \\\\Delta V for the two maneuvers. The combined \\\\Delta V is the vector sum of the inclination change \\\\Delta V and the circularization \\\\Delta V, and as the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle will always exceed the remaining side's length, total \\\\Delta V in a combined maneuver will always be less than in two maneuvers. The combined \\\\Delta V can be calculated as follows: :\\\\Delta V = \\\\sqrt{ V_{t,a}^2 + V_\\\\text{GEO}^2 - 2 V_{t,a} V_\\\\text{GEO} \\\\cos \\\\Delta i}, where V_{t,a} is the velocity magnitude at the apogee of the transfer orbit and V_\\\\text{GEO} is the velocity in GEO. Other considerations Even at apogee, the fuel needed to reduce inclination to zero can be significant, giving equatorial launch sites a substantial advantage over those at higher latitudes. Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is at 46¬∞ north latitude. Kennedy Space Center is at 28.5¬∞ north. Guiana Space Centre, the Ariane launch facility, is at 5¬∞ north. Sea Launch launches from a floating platform directly on the equator in the Pacific Ocean. Expendable launchers generally reach GTO directly, but a spacecraft already in a low Earth orbit (LEO) can enter GTO by firing a rocket along its orbital direction to increase its velocity. This was done when geostationary spacecraft were launched from the space Shuttle; a \\"perigee kick motor\\" attached to the spacecraft ignited after the shuttle had released it and withdrawn to a safe distance. Although some launchers can take their payloads all the way to geostationary orbit, most end their missions by releasing their payloads into GTO. The spacecraft and its operator are then responsible for the maneuver into the final geostationary orbit. The 5-hour coast to first apogee can be longer than the battery lifetime of the launcher or spacecraft, and the maneuver is sometimes performed at a later apogee or split among multiple apogees. The solar power available on the spacecraft supports the mission after launcher separation. Also, many launchers now carry several satellites in each launch to reduce overall costs, and this practice simplifies the mission when the payloads may be destined for different orbital positions. Because of this practice, launcher capacity is usually quoted as spacecraft mass to GTO, and this number will be higher than the payload that could be delivered directly into GEO. For example, the capacity (adapter and spacecraft mass) of the Delta IV Heavy is 14,200 kg to GTO, or 6,750 kg directly to geostationary orbit.United Launch Alliance, Delta IV Launch Services User's Guide June 2013, p. 2-10, Figure 2-9; accessed 2013 July 27. If the manoeuvre from GTO to GEO is to be performed with a single impulse, as with a single solid-rocket motor, apogee must occur at an equatorial crossing and at synchronous orbit altitude. This implies an argument of perigee of either 0¬∞ or 180¬∞. Because the argument of perigee is slowly perturbed by the oblateness of the Earth, it is usually biased at launch so that it reaches the desired value at the appropriate time (for example, this is usually the sixth apogee on Ariane 5 launchesArianeSpace, Ariane 5 User's Manual Issue 5 Revision 1, 2011 July, p. 2-13, accessed 8 March 2016.). If the GTO inclination is zero, as with Sea Launch, then this does not apply. (It also would not apply to an impractical GTO inclined at 63.4¬∞; see Molniya orbit.) The preceding discussion has primarily focused on the case where the transfer between LEO and GEO is done with a single intermediate transfer orbit. More complicated trajectories are sometimes used. For example, the Proton-M uses a set of three intermediate orbits, requiring five upper-stage rocket firings, to place a satellite into GEO from the high-inclination site of Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan.International Launch Services, Proton Mission Planner's Guide Rev. 7 2009 November, p. 2-13, Figure 2.3.2-1, accessed 2013 July 27. Because of Baikonur's high latitude and range safety considerations that block launches directly east, it requires less delta-v to transfer satellites to GEO by using a supersynchronous transfer orbit where the apogee (and the maneuver to reduce the transfer orbit inclination) are at a higher altitude than 35,786 km, the geosynchronous altitude. Proton even offers to perform a supersynchronous apogee maneuver up to 15 hours after launch.International Launch Services, Proton Mission Planner's Guide Rev. 7 2009 November, accessed 2013 July 27 Appendix F.4.2, page F-8.

Due to the valuable science return and the highly flexible mission profile, Mars Express has been granted several mission extensions. The latest one, as of November 2018, is scheduled to end in late 2020, when it is expected to receive another mission extension lasting until 2022. Some of the instruments on the orbiter, including the camera systems and some spectrometers, reuse designs from the failed launch of the Russian Mars 96 mission in 1996 (European countries had provided much of the instrumentation and financing for that unsuccessful mission). The design of Mars Express is based on ESA's Rosetta mission, on which a considerable sum was spent on development. The same design was also used for ESA's Venus Express mission in order to increase reliability and reduce development cost and time. Because of these redesigns and repurposings, the total cost of the project was about $345 million- less than half of comparable U.S. missions.Announcement by the European Space Agency on the launch of the Mars Express space probe: \\"Mars en route for the red planet\\". (2004). Historic documents of 2003.Washington, DC: CQ Press. Retrieved from http://library.cqpress.com/cqpac/hsdcp03p-229-9844-633819 Arriving at Mars in 2003, ago (and counting), it is the second longest surviving, continually active spacecraft in orbit around a planet other than Earth, behind only NASA's still active 2001 Mars Odyssey.  Mission profile and timeline overview  = Mission overview = The Mars Express mission is dedicated to the orbital (and originally in-situ) study of the interior, subsurface, surface and atmosphere, and environment of the planet Mars. The scientific objectives of the Mars Express mission represent an attempt to fulfill in part the lost scientific goals of the Russian Mars 96 mission, complemented by exobiology research with Beagle-2. Mars exploration is crucial for a better understanding of the Earth from the perspective of comparative planetology. The spacecraft originally carried seven scientific instruments, a small lander, a lander relay and a Visual Monitoring Camera, all designed to contribute to solving the mystery of Mars' missing water. All of the instruments take measurements of the surface, atmosphere and interplanetary media, from the main spacecraft in polar orbit, which will allow it to gradually cover the whole planet. The total initial Mars Express budget excluding the lander was ‚Ç¨150 million. The prime contractor for the construction of Mars Express orbiter was EADS Astrium Satellites. = Mission preparation = In the years preceding the launch of a spacecraft numerous teams of experts distributed over the contributing companies and organisations prepared the space and ground segments. Each of these teams focussed on the area of its responsibility and interfacing as required. A major additional requirement raised for the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and all critical operational phases was that it was not enough merely to interface; the teams had to be integrated into one Mission Control Team. All the different experts had to work together in an operational environment and the interaction and interfaces between all elements of the system (software, hardware and human) had to run smoothly for this to happen: * the flight operations procedures had to be written and validated down to the smallest detail; * the control system had to be validated; * system Validation Tests (SVTs) with the satellite had to be performed to demonstrate the correct interfacing of the ground and space segments; * mission Readiness Test with the Ground Stations had to be performed; * a Simulations Campaign was run. = Launch = Animation of Mars Express's trajectory around Sun The spacecraft was launched on June 2, 2003 at 23:45 local time (17:45 UT, 1:45 p.m. EDT) from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, using a Soyuz-FG/Fregat rocket. The Mars Express and Fregat booster were initially put into a 200 km Earth parking orbit, then the Fregat was fired again at 19:14 UT to put the spacecraft into a Mars transfer orbit. The Fregat and Mars Express separated at approximately 19:17 UT. The solar panels were then deployed and a trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on June 4 to aim Mars Express towards Mars and allow the Fregat booster to coast into interplanetary space. The Mars Express was the first Russian-launched probe to successfully make it out of low Earth orbit since the Soviet Union fell. = Near Earth commissioning phase = The Near Earth commissioning phase extended from the separation of the spacecraft from the launcher upper stage until the completion of the initial check out of the orbiter and payload. It included the solar array deployment, the initial attitude acquisition, the declamping of the Beagle-2 spin-up mechanism, the injection error correction manoeuvre and the first commissioning of the spacecraft and payload (final commissioning of payload took place after Mars Orbit Insertion). The payload was checked out one instrument at a time. This phase lasted about one month. = The interplanetary cruise phase = This five month phase lasted from the end of the Near Earth Commissioning phase until one month prior to the Mars capture manoeuvre and included trajectory correction manoeuvres and payloads calibration. The payload was mostly switched off during the cruise phase, with the exception of some intermediate check-outs. Although it was originally meant to be a \\"quiet cruise\\" phase, It soon became obvious that this \\"cruise\\" would be indeed very busy. There were star Tracker problems, a power wiring problem, extra manoeuvres, and on October 28, the spacecraft was hit by one of the largest solar flares ever recorded. = Lander jettison = The Beagle 2 lander was released on December 19, 2003 at 8:31 UTC (9:31 CET) on a ballistic cruise towards the surface. It entered Mars' atmosphere on the morning of December 25. Landing was expected to occur at about 02:45 UT on December 25 (9:45 p.m. EST December 24). However, after repeated attempts to contact the lander failed using the Mars Express craft and the NASA Mars Odyssey orbiter, it was declared lost on February 6, 2004, by the Beagle 2 Management Board. An inquiry was held and its findings were published later that year. = Orbit insertion = Animation of Mars Express trajectory around Mars from December 25, 2003 to January 1, 2010 Mars Express arrived at Mars after a 400 million km journey and course corrections in September and in December 2003. On December 20 Mars Express fired a short thruster burst to put it into position to orbit the planet. The Mars Express orbiter then fired its main engine and went into a highly elliptical initial-capture orbit of 250 km √ó 150,000 km with an inclination of 25 degrees on December 25 at 03:00 UT (10:00 p.m., December 24 EST). First evaluation of the orbital insertion showed that the orbiter had reached its first milestone at Mars. The orbit was later adjusted by four more main engine firings to the desired 259 km √ó 11,560 km near-polar (86 degree inclination) orbit with a period of 7.5 hours. Near periapsis (nearest to Mars) the top deck is pointed down towards the Martian surface and near apoapsis (farthest from Mars in its orbit) the high gain antenna will be pointed towards Earth for uplink and downlink. After 100 days the apoapsis was lowered to 10,107 km and periapsis raised to 298 km to give an orbital period of 6.7 hours. = MARSIS deployment = Illustration of Mars Express with MARSIS antenna deployed On May 4, 2005, Mars Express deployed the first of its two 20-metre- long radar booms for its MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) experiment. At first the boom did not lock fully into place; however, exposing it to sunlight for a few minutes on May 10 fixed the glitch. The second 20 m boom was successfully deployed on June 14. Both 20 m booms were needed to create a 40 m dipole antenna for MARSIS to work; a less crucial 7-meter-long monopole antenna was deployed on June 17. The radar booms were originally scheduled to be deployed in April 2004, but this was delayed out of fear that the deployment could damage the spacecraft through a whiplash effect. Due to the delay it was decided to split the four-week commissioning phase in two parts, with two weeks running up to July 4 and another two weeks in December 2005. The deployment of the booms was a critical and highly complex task requiring effective inter-agency cooperation ESA, NASA, Industry and public Universities. Nominal science observations began during July 2005. (For more info see, and ESA Portal - Mars Express radar ready to work ESA press release.) = Operations of the spacecraft = Operations for Mars Express are carried out by a multinational team of engineers from ESA's Operation Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt. The team began preparations for the mission about 3 to 4 years prior to the actual launch. This involved preparing the ground segment and the operational procedures for the whole mission. The Mission Control Team is composed of the Flight Control Team, Flight Dynamics Team, Ground Operations Managers, Software Support and Ground Facilities Engineers. All of these are located at ESOC but there are additionally external teams, such as the Project and Industry Support teams, who designed and built the spacecraft. The Flight Control Team currently consists of: * The Spacecraft Operations Manager * Six Operations Engineers (including three Mission Planners) * One Spacecraft Analyst * Six spacecraft controllers (SpaCons), shared with ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter. The team build-up, headed by the Spacecraft Operations Manager, started about 4 years before launch. He was required to recruit a suitable team of engineers that could handle the varying tasks involved in the mission. For Mars Express the engineers came from various other missions. Most of them had been involved with Earth orbiting satellites. = Routine phase: science return = SouthPole Site of Subglacial Water (July 25, 2018) Since orbit insertion Mars Express has been progressively fulfilling its original scientific goals. Nominally the spacecraft points to Mars while acquiring science and then slews to Earth-pointing to downlink the data, although some instruments like Marsis or Radio Science might be operated while spacecraft is Earth-pointing.  Orbiter and subsystems  = Structure = The Mars Express orbiter is a cube-shaped spacecraft with two solar panel wings extending from opposite sides. The launch mass of 1223 kg includes a main bus with 113 kg of payload, the 60 kg lander, and 457 kg of propellant. The main body is 1.5 m √ó 1.8 m √ó 1.4 m in size, with an aluminium honeycomb structure covered by an aluminium skin. The solar panels measure about 12 m tip-to-tip. Two 20 m long wire dipole antennas extend from opposite side faces perpendicular to the solar panels as part of the radar sounder. = Propulsion = The Soyuz/Fregat launcher provided most of the thrust Mars Express needed to reach Mars. The final stage of the Fregat was jettisoned once the probe was safely on a course for Mars. The spacecraft's on-board means of propulsion was used to slow the probe for Mars orbit insertion and subsequently for orbit corrections. The body is built around the main propulsion system, which consists of a bipropellant 400 N main engine. The two 267-liter propellant tanks have a total capacity of 595 kg. Approximately 370 kg are needed for the nominal mission. Pressurized helium from a 35-liter tank is used to force fuel into the engine. Trajectory corrections will be made using a set of eight 10 N thrusters, one attached to each corner of the spacecraft bus. The spacecraft configuration is optimized for a Soyuz/Fregat, and was fully compatible with a Delta II launch vehicle. = Power = Spacecraft power is provided by the solar panels which contain 11.42 square meters of silicon cells. The originally planned power was to be 660 W at 1.5 AU but a faulty connection has reduced the amount of power available by 30%, to about 460 W. This loss of power does significantly impact the science return of the mission. Power is stored in three lithium-ion batteries with a total capacity of 64.8 Ah for use during eclipses. The power is fully regulated at 28 V, and the Terma power module (also used in Rosetta) is redundant. During routine phase, the spacecraft's power consumption is in the range of 450 W - 550 W. = Avionics = Attitude control (3-axis stabilization) is achieved using two 3-axis inertial measurement units, a set of two star cameras and two Sun sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and four 12 N¬∑m¬∑s reaction wheels. Pointing accuracy is 0.04 degree with respect to the inertial reference frame and 0.8 degree with respect to the Mars orbital frame. Three on-board systems help Mars Express maintain a very precise pointing accuracy, which is essential to allow the spacecraft to communicate with a 35-metre and 70-metre dish on Earth up to 400 million kilometres away. = Communications = The communications subsystem is composed of 3 antennas: A 1.6 m diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna and two omnidirectional antennas. The first one provide links (telecommands uplink and telemetry downlink) in both X-band (8.4 GHz) and S-band (2.1 GHz) and is used during nominal science phase around Mars. The low gain antennas are used during Launch and early operations to Mars and for eventual contingencies once in orbit. Two Mars lander relay UHF antennas are mounted on the top face for communication with the Beagle 2 or other landers, using a Melacom transceiver.  Earth stations  Although communications with Earth were originally scheduled to take place with the ESA 35-meter wide Ground Station in New Norcia (Australia) New Norcia Station, the mission profile of progressive enhancement and science return flexibility have triggered the use of the ESA ESTRACK Ground Stations in Cebreros Station, Madrid, Spain and Malarg√ºe Station, Argentina. In addition, further agreements with NASA Deep Space Network have made possible the use of American stations for nominal mission planning, thus increasing complexity but with a clear positive impact in scientific returns. This inter-agency cooperation has proven effective, flexible and enriching for both sides. On the technical side, it has been made possible (among other reasons) thanks to the adoption of both Agencies of the Standards for Space Communications defined in CCSDS. = Thermal = Thermal control is maintained through the use of radiators, multi-layer insulation, and actively controlled heaters. The spacecraft must provide a benign environment for the instruments and on-board equipment. Two instruments, PFS and OMEGA, have infrared detectors that need to be kept at very low temperatures (about ‚àí180 ¬∞C). The sensors on the camera (HRSC) also need to be kept cool. But the rest of the instruments and on-board equipment function best at room temperatures (10‚Äì20 ¬∞C). The spacecraft is covered in gold-plated aluminium-tin alloy thermal blankets to maintain a temperature of 10‚Äì20 ¬∞C inside the spacecraft. The instruments that operate at low temperatures to be kept cold are thermally insulated from this relatively high internal temperature, and emit excess heat into space using attached radiators. = Control unit and data storage = The spacecraft is run by two Control and Data management Units with 12 gigabits of solid state mass memory for storage of data and housekeeping information for transmission. The on- board computers control all aspects of the spacecraft functioning including switching instruments on and off, assessing the spacecraft orientation in space and issuing commands to change it. Another key aspect of the Mars Express mission is its artificial intelligence tool (MEXAR2). The primary purpose of the AI tool is the scheduling of when to download various parts of the collected scientific data back to Earth, a process which used to take ground controllers a significant amount of time. The new AI tool saves operator time, optimizes bandwidth use on the DSN, prevents data loss, and allows better use of the DSN for other space operations as well. The AI decides how to manage the spacecraft's 12 gigabits of storage memory, when the DSN will be available and not be in use by another mission, how to make the best use of the DSN bandwidth allocated to it, and when the spacecraft will be oriented properly to transmit back to Earth. = Lander = A replica of the Beagle 2 lander component of Mars Express at the Science Museum London. The Beagle 2 lander objectives were to characterize the landing site geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry, the physical properties of the atmosphere and surface layers, collect data on Martian meteorology and climatology, and search for possible signatures of life. However, the landing attempt was unsuccessful and the lander was declared lost. A Commission of Inquiry on Beagle 2 identified several possible causes, including airbag problems, severe shocks to the lander's electronics which had not been simulated adequately before launch, and problems with parts of the landing system colliding; but was unable to reach any firm conclusions. The spacecraft's fate remained a mystery until it was announced in January 2015 that NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, using HiRISE, had found the probe intact on the surface of Mars. It was then determined that an error had prevented two of the spacecraft's four solar panels from deploying, blocking the spacecraft's communications. Beagle 2 was the first British and first European probe to achieve a landing on Mars.  Scientific instruments  The scientific objectives of the Mars Express payload are to obtain global high-resolution photo-geology (10 m resolution), mineralogical mapping (100 m resolution) and mapping of the atmospheric composition, study the subsurface structure, the global atmospheric circulation, and the interaction between the atmosphere and the subsurface, and the atmosphere and the interplanetary medium. The total mass budgeted for the science payload is 116 kg. The payload scientific instruments are: * Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer (OMEGA) (Observatoire pour la Min√©ralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activit√©) - France - Determines mineral composition of the surface up to 100 m resolution. Is mounted inside pointing out the top face. Instrument mass: 28.6 kg * Ultraviolet and Infrared Atmospheric Spectrometer (SPICAM) - France - Assesses elemental composition of the atmosphere. Is mounted inside pointing out the top face. Instrument mass: 4.7 kg * Sub-Surface Sounding Radar Altimeter (MARSIS) - Italy - A radar altimeter used to assess composition of sub-surface aimed at search for frozen water. Is mounted in the body and is nadir pointing, and also incorporates the two 20 m antennas. Instrument mass: 13.7 kg * Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) - Italy - Makes observations of atmospheric temperature and pressure (observations suspended in September 2005). Is mounted inside pointing out the top face and is currently working. Instrument mass: 30.8 kg * Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA) - Sweden - Investigates interactions between upper atmosphere and solar wind. Is mounted on the top face. Instrument mass: 7.9 kg * High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) - Germany - Produces color images with up to 2 m resolution. Is mounted inside the spacecraft body, aimed through the top face of the spacecraft, which is nadir pointing during Mars operations. Instrument mass: 20.4 kg * Mars Express Lander Communications (MELACOM) - UK - Allows Mars Express to act as a communication relay for landers on the Martian surface. (Has been used on both Mars Exploration Rovers, and was used to support the landing of NASA's Phoenix mission) * Mars Radio Science Experiment (MaRS) - Uses radio signals to investigate atmosphere, surface, subsurface, gravity and solar corona density during solar conjunctions. It uses the communications subsystem itself. * Visual Monitoring Camera, a small camera to monitor the lander ejection.  Scientific discoveries and important events  For more than 20,000 orbits, Mars Express payload instruments have been nominally and regularly operated. The HRSC camera has been consistently mapping the Martian surface with unprecedented resolution and has acquired multiple images. = 2004 = * January 23 :: ESA announced the discovery of water ice in the south polar ice cap, using data collected by the OMEGA instrument. * January 28 :: Mars Express orbiter reaches final science orbit altitude around Mars. * March 17 :: Orbiter detects polar ice caps that contain 85% carbon dioxide (CO2) ice and 15% water ice. * March 30 :: A press release announces that the orbiter has detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. Although the amount is small, about 10 parts in a thousand million, it has excited scientists to question its source. Since methane is removed from the Martian atmosphere very rapidly, there must be a current source that replenishes it. Because one of the possible sources could be microbial life, it is planned to verify the reliability of these data and especially watch for difference in the concentration in various places on Mars. It is hoped that the source of this gas can be discovered by finding its location of release. * April 28 :: ESA announced that the deployment of the boom carrying the radar-based MARSIS antenna was delayed. It described concerns with the motion of the boom during deployment, which can cause the spacecraft to be struck by elements of it. Further investigations are planned to make sure that this will not happen. * July 15 :: Scientists working with the PFS instrument announced that they tentatively discovered the spectral features of the compound ammonia in the Martian atmosphere. Just like methane discovered earlier (see above), ammonia breaks down rapidly in Mars' atmosphere and needs to be constantly replenished. This points towards the existence of active life or geological activity; two contending phenomena whose presence so far have remained undetected. = 2005 = * In 2005, ESA scientists reported that the OMEGA (Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer)(Observatoire pour la Min√©ralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activit√©) instrument data indicates the presence of hydrated sulphates, silicates and various rock-forming minerals. * February 8 :: The delayed deployment of the MARSIS antenna has been given a green light by ESA. It is planned to take place in early May 2005. * May 5 :: The first boom of the MARSIS antenna was successfully deployed. At first, there was no indication of any problems, but later it was discovered that one segment of the boom did not lock. The deployment of the second boom was delayed to allow for further analysis of the problem. * May 11 :: Using the Sun's heat to expand the segments of the MARSIS antenna, the last segment locked in successfully. * June 14 :: The second boom was deployed, and on June 16 ESA announced it was a success. * June 22 :: ESA announces that MARSIS is fully operational and will soon begin acquiring data. This comes after the deployment of the third boom on June 17, and a successful transmission test on June 19. = 2006 = * September 21 :: The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) has obtained images of the Cydonia region, the location of the famous \\"Face on Mars\\". The massif became famous in a photo taken in 1976 by the American Viking 1 Orbiter. The image recorded with a ground resolution of approximately 13.7 metres per pixel. * September 26 :: The Mars Express spacecraft emerged from an unusually demanding eclipse introducing a special, ultra-low-power mode nicknamed 'Sumo' - an innovative configuration aimed at saving the power necessary to ensure spacecraft survival. ::This mode was developed through teamwork between ESOC mission controllers, principal investigators, industry, and mission management. * October :: In October 2006 the Mars Express spacecraft encountered a superior solar conjunction (alignment of Earth-Sun-Mars-orbiter). The angle Sun-Earth-orbiter reached a minimum on October 23 at 0.39¬∞ at a distance of 2.66 AU. Operational measures were undertaken to minimize the impact of the link degradation, since the higher density of electrons in the solar plasma heavily impacts the radio frequency signal. * December :: Following the loss of NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Express team was requested to perform actions in the hopes of visually identifying the American spacecraft. Based on last ephemeris of MGS provided by JPL, the on-board high definition HRSC camera swept a region of the MGS orbit. Two attempts were made to find the craft, both unsuccessful. = 2007 = Greyscale view of Phobos over Mars, 2007 ESA/DLR/FU Berlin * January :: First agreements with NASA undertaken for the support by Mars Express on the landing of the American lander Phoenix in May 2008. * February :: The small camera VMC (used only once to monitor the lander ejection) was recommissioned and first steps were taken to offer students the possibility to participate in a campaign \\"Command Mars Express Spacecraft and take your own picture of Mars\\". * February 23 :: As result of the science return, the Science Program Committee (SPC) granted a mission extension until May 2009. * June 28 :: The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) has produced images of key tectonic features in Aeolis Mensae. = 2008 = * The Mars Express Team was the winner of the Sir Arthur Clarke Award for Best Team Achievement. = 2009 = * February 4 :: The ESA's Science Programme Committee has extended the operations of Mars Express until December 31, 2009. *October 7 ::ESA's Science Programme Committee has approved the extension of mission operations for Mars Express until December 31, 2012. = 2010 = *March 5 ::Flyby of Phobos to measure Phobos' gravity. = 2011 = *August 13 ::Safe mode following a Solid-State Mass Memory problem. *August 23 ::Solid- State Mass Memory problem. *September 23 ::Safe mode following a Solid-State Mass Memory problem. *October 11 ::Solid-State Mass Memory problem. *October 16 ::Safe mode following a Solid-State Mass Memory problem. *November 24 ::Science operations are resumed using the Short Mission Timeline and Command Files instead of the Long Time Line resident on the suspect Solid-State Mass Memory. = 2012 = * February 16 ::Resumes full science operations.

It is part of the traditional region of Grenland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Siljan. The parish of Slemdal was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The name was later changed to Siljan. The municipality is located northeast of Skien and borders Buskerud county in the north and Vestfold og Telemark county in the east. There is a forest district on both sides of Skiensvassdraget (Skien river). The older main road to Skien, Larvik, and Oslo, passes through Siljan. General information =Name= The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Siljan farm (Old Norse: Seljur), since the first church was built there. The name is (probably) the plural form of selja which means \\"sallow tree\\" or \\"willow\\". Prior to 1918, the name of the municipality was Slemdal. =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted in 1989. The arms show three white saw blades on a green background.

It is part of the traditional region of Vest-Telemark. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Moland. The municipality of Moland was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). In 1879, the name was changed to Fyresdal. General information =Name= The Old Norse form of the name was Fyrisdalr. The first element is the genitive case of the name of the lake Fyrir (now called Fyresvatn). The last element is dalr which means \\"valley\\" or \\"dale\\". The name of the lake is derived from the word fura which means \\"pine tree\\". Prior to 1879, the municipality was called Moland. =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted in 1992. The arms show two silver- colored broadaxes on a green background. It was chosen to represent the forestry work in the municipality. History Fyresdal is known for its many findings from the Viking Age, its mighty Viking graves, heaps of slag, and the former pilgrim church that once stood proudly north of the village centre. People travelled to this church from all over Norway and even from Europe. It was said that the stream running behind the church had healing powers. A few miles south of the site where the Heggland Pilgrim Church (), once stood at Molandsmoen, a stone with Runic inscriptions can be found. This is a reminder from the Viking Age when horse battles were held there. Originally, one believes, there were four of them. Klokkarhamaren is a little mountain on a peninsula in the municipal centre, and it is the location of a cave called Munkhola. It is believed that a certain number of monks in Medieval times resided, held masses, and sought refuge here. Economy Most people in the municipality work in the fields of agriculture, forestry, trade, industry and tourism. There are not many full-time farmers left in Fyresdal, but many people derive a secondary income from agriculture and forestry. The largest employer in the municipality is Telemark Kildevann which makes bottled water and soft drinks for the national and Swedish markets. There are also a few small high-competence mechanical factories which produce parts for the offshore industry. Transportation The Vest-Telemark airport, Fyresdal is located in Moland, with a nearby hotel. This is a joint operation under the name Airparc Fyresdal. Fyresdal has bus connections with the city centres of Skien and Porsgrunn in Telemark county; Arendal in Aust-Agder county; Bergen in Hordaland county; Haugesund in Rogaland county; and to the capital, Oslo. A bus also travels between Fyresdal and Dalen, the municipal centre of Tokke, every school day of the year. Geography Small lake in Fyresdal The municipality of Fyresdal consists of several little villages north of the municipal centre, in the main valley of Fyresdal, and on the western and southeastern shores of Fyresvatn (Lake Fyresdal), one of Norway's deepest lakes. The municipal centre of Fyresdal is Moland. This is the location of the municipal assembly, the school, the community house, kindergartens, the home for the elderly, and most of the commercial enterprises in the village. Moland is the most heavily populated aea of Fyresdal. Fyresdal is among the westernmost municipalities in Telemark. It borders the municipalities of Tokke, Kviteseid, and Nissedal in Telemark county. It also shares borders with the municipalities of √Ömli, Bygland, and Valle in Aust-Agder county. =Neighbourhoods in Fyresdal= Attractions *One of Fyresdal's two churches (Moland Kyrkje) and the vicarage (Fyresdal Prestegard) are located in Moland. According to Telemark folklore, the Troll of R√∏ykjenes moved across the lake because the bells of the Moland church were disturbing its nap. The vicarage is where Vidkun Quisling was born. *Within the administrative center of Moland, one also finds the old village centre, Folkestadbyen. Folkestadbyen is the location of the Fyresdal Vertshus, a Swiss-styled dwelling built in 1890. It has housed and served both food and drinks to locals and travellers for over 100 years. √òyskogen park, which contains Viking graves and a lot of traditional Telemark houses (e.g. lofts and stabburs) is also part of the old village. The Fyresdal Bygdemuseum, the village museum, is also located in √òyskogen. Folkestadbyen was named the prettiest town/village centre in Telemark in 2003. *Rv 355 runs straight through the municipality from north to south. Hegglandsgrend, Veum, and Hauggrend are villages along Rv 355 located north of Moland. Hegglandsgrend is the home of Heggland Gamle Kyrkjegard; Veum is the home of Veum Kyrkje. A Rudolf Steiner School (an upper secondary level school) was located at Folds√¶ in Hauggrend. This so-called friskole (\\"Free school\\") based on the thoughts and ideas of Rudolf Steiner was however closed down after few years. In Hauggrend, one also finds the most distinct mountain in Fyresdal, Roan. This peak is above sea level, but not the highest point in the municipality, since the border to Valle passes near the peak of Napuren, at a height of above sea level, some 300 feet higher. *North of Moland, to the west from the main valley we find the little settlements of Kleivgrend, √Öslandsgrend. Turning left of the Rv 355 in Hegglandsgrend, one comes to Kleivgrend and √Öslandsgrend. Between Kleivgrend and the neighbouring municipality Valle on the western side of the mountains, one finds an old track that priests and bishops used to get between the counties of Agder and Telemark. This track is named Bispevegen (\\"Bishop's Road\\") and every year a march called Bispevegmarsjen (\\"The Bishop's Road March\\") starts in Kleivgrend. In Fjellgardane, Germans ran mines in the 16th century at Moisesberg. *On the western shores of Fyresvatn (Lake Fyresdal), to the southwest of Moland, one finds the villages of Fardal, Breivik. Here one finds an old and interesting stone called R√∏ykjenessteinen. In 2005, one also found some arrowheads in this area that are believed to be 4000‚Äì4500 years old. Farther along the country road we find Birtedalen, a popular place for people who set up mountain cabins. *South of Moland, at the southern end of Rv 355 across the scenic and mighty mountain of V√•mur where one can see the lake from up above, one comes to the little village of Kilegrend. In the old days there was no road connecting Kilegrend with the municipal centre. Thus one had to travel by boat. For years the steamboats called Teisner and Fyresd√∏len travelled between Moland and Kilegrend. The latter eventually capsized and sank. The wreck is still visible in Kilegrend.

General information = Etymology = A man in a traditional red hat by F. C. Lund. Nissedal is named after Nisser Lake, which is the largest lake in Telemark County.https://www.telemarkskilder.no/bitstream/handle/123456789/2939/RAPPORT_Vedlausfjell.pdf?sequence=1 (Page 5). The modern form of the name stems from Old Norse Nizidalr. The first element is the name of the lake Nizir, possibly from *Ni√∞-s√¶r, which is now called Nisser, and the last element is dalr \\"valley, dale\\".Stemshaug (1973:117).Cleasby and Vigfusson (1874:95). = Coat of arms = The coat of arms was granted on October 30, 1992, and was designed by Halvor Holtskog jr. The arms shows three red nisseluer, traditional red woolen hats often associated with the nisse, which were commonly worn until the late 19th century by farmers and common folk. It is a canting arms, as the name Nissedal has been \\"translated\\" into a visual pun with the three woolen hats, in spite of the name having nothing to do with the folkloric nisse. History One of the earliest areas to be populated in Nissedal was the cave Holmevasshelleren, approximately 40 meters (44 yards) from the lake Holmevatn at Kyrkjebygdheia. Archeological discoveries have dated prehistoric settlements at Holmevasshelleren to Neolithic times, 3800 BCE-6000 BCE. The cave is 18 meters long, four meters high, and three meters deep.Haugene, Kjell Peder (2014). 40 turer i Drangedal og Gautefall. Sento Forlag AS. Page 157. . Ancient rock paintings from the Bronze Age can be seen at various sites in Nissedal, including by a steep mountain by Trontveit farm on the western side of the lake Nisser. Such paintings are also found by Kvithamar further north.https://snl.no/Nissedal The rock art site at Kvithammaren (‚ÄúThe White Crag‚Äù) is named for the site where it is painted, namely a white niche in the mountainside, roughly 3-4 meters (10-13 ft.) above the surface of Nisser Lake, at the foot of a 50-meter high cliff. It is easily visible from distance and may have been seen as openings in Earth and a link to the underworld. The other rock painting by Nisser Lake is known as Ovnen (‚ÄúThe Oven‚Äù) and is located at the foot of a 20-meter high escarpment which originally jutted up in front of the panel. This painting depicts a row of human figures, an animal pictograph, and a pattern of zigzag lines. A local clergyman visited the paintings in the early 1800s and claimed the human figures at Ovnen to have been drawn by a monk in the memory of a bridal procession that drowned. Their colloquial name, Munkeskrifta (‚ÄúThe Monk‚Äôs Drawings‚Äù), is a reference to this.Lodoen, Trond and Gro Mandt (2010). The Rock Art of Norway. Windgather Press. Pages 268-269. . An ancient archeological monument from the Bronze Age, dating to 1800 BCE-500 BCE, can also be seen by Stolsvasslonene. It is a solar symbol of a sun wheel which is 40-centimeter in diameter.Haugene, Kjell Peder (2014). 40 turer i Drangedal og Gautefall. Sento Forlag AS. Pages 192-194. . Heigeitilen, a boundary marker on the border between the three parishes T√∏rdal, Nissedal and Treungen, was first mentioned in written sources in 1792. It is likely an ancient marker and can be reached from the Heigeitill√∏ypa trail.Haugene, Kjell Peder (2014). 40 turer i Drangedal og Gautefall. Sento Forlag AS. Page 163. . The valley known as Uvdalen has been populated since the Stone Age. Protected from the wind by the mountain Heitfjell, the area was likely inhabited for hundreds of years. Archeological surveys here have retrieved various artifacts from the Stone Age, including arrowheads and flint tools. The first written record of inhabitants in Uvdalen dates to 1574, while the last permanent inhabitants left the valley in 1910. The 1733 census indicates that Bj√∏rn Alvson and his wife Torbj√∏rg lived on a farm here with nine cows, 42 sheep, 16 goats, and two horses, among other animals. The 1865 census showed a total population of 24 in Uvdalen.Haugene, Kjell Peder (2014). 40 turer i Drangedal og Gautefall. Sento Forlag AS. Pages 198-200. .

At this time secondary schools mostly existed in the larger towns and cities, and most youngsters ended their schooling after 7 years. It was the county's intention to expand this school to a high school as soon as practically possible. This happened in 1947, and the school's name was Telemark Offentlige Landsgymnas. The existence of this school made it possible to establish Telemark College (Distriktsh√∏gskulen i Telemark), which evolved into Telemark University College.

In modern times it is regarded as part of the traditional region of Grenland, although historically it belonged to Grenmar/Skiensfjorden, while Grenland referred the Norsj√∏ area and B√∏. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Skien. Skien is also the capital of Vestfold og Telemark county. Skien is one of Norway's oldest cities, with an urban history dating back to the Middle Ages, and received privileges as a market town in 1358. From the 15th century, the city was governed by a 12-member council. The modern municipality of Skien was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The rural municipalities of Gjerpen and Solum were merged into the municipality of Skien on 1 January 1964. The conurbation of Porsgrunn/Skien is reckoned by Statistics Norway to be the seventh largest urban area in Norway, straddling an area of three municipalities: Skien municipality (about 62% of the population), Porsgrunn (30%), and Bamble (8%). This area is home to more than 100,000 people. Skien was historically Norway's most important port town for shipping timber and one of Norway's leading commercial cities with extensive contact with neighbouring countries, particularly Denmark. The city was the birthplace of playwright Henrik Ibsen, and many of his famous dramas are set in places reminiscent of 19th-century Skien. Demographics =Immigrants= 16.8% of the population in Skien are immigrants. =Religion= 67% of people in Skien belong to the Church of Norway. 17% of people belong to a religious group outside of the Church of Norway. General information =Name= The Old Norse form of the name was Ski√∞a (from the word ski√∞a which means \\"straight plank\\"), and the town is probably named after a brook (with a straight run) with this name. =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms is derived from the oldest known seal of the city, dating back to 1609. The seal shows two skis and in the middle a cross, with a small star on the crosspoint. The skis are a semi-canting element (based on a misunderstanding of the meaning of the town's name) and the cross is a religious symbol. There have been several theories about the meaning of the cross, but its meaning is not clearly known. It has been suggested that it is a symbol for the main church in Skien, the Holy Cross church. The small star may be a symbol of St. Mary as the second medieval church of Skien was devoted to her. Besides the skis and cross, there are two meadow buttercups on each side. In 1854, the arms were shown as two skis, but the cross was now made from ski poles, as another canting element. This remained so until the early half of the 20th century. In the 1980s, the city officially adopted the current arms, which are identical to the oldest seal. The colours are the colours that have been used since the 19th century. The differences between the seal and the present arms are that in the arms the cross is placed on top of the skis and the star is changed from a four-pointed star to a six-pointed star, and that the cross is made of ski-poles. (See also Alvdal and Trysil) History Frogner Manor in Skien Until 1979, it was thought that Skien was founded in the 14th century. However, the archaeological discovery of a carving of the Skien animal has established that its founding preceded 1000 A.D. The city was then a meeting place for inland farmers and marine traders, and also a centre for trading whetstones from Eidsborg (inland Telemark). Gims√∏y Abbey was founded in the 12th century. Skien was given formal commercial town rights by the Norwegian crown in 1358. Timber has historically been the principal export from Skien, and in the sixteenth century the city became the Kingdom's leading port for shipping timber. The oldest remaining building is Gjerpen church (built in approximately 1150). From the 16th century, the city came to be dominated by a group of families known as patricians. In an 1882 letter to Georg Brandes, Henrik Ibsen mentions the families Paus, Plesner, von der Lippe, Cappelen and Blom as the most prominent patrician families when he grew up there. The current town layout was fixed after the last town fire in 1886. In 1964, the rural municipalities Solum and Gjerpen were merged with Skien town, forming the Skien municipality. =Frogner Manor in Skien= Frogner Manor (Frogner Hovedg√•rd) is a manor house on the outskirts of Skien. The manor house was built for shipowner and timber merchant Christopher Hansen Blom (died 1879) and his wife Marie Elisabeth (Cappelen) Blom (died 1834). The main building is influenced by Italian Renaissance architecture. The garden was laid out in English landscape style in the 1850s. Kapitelberget church ruins =Kapitelberget= The Church on Kapitelberget (Kirken p√• Kapitelberget) was a medieval church. Kapitelberget was a private chapel on Bratsberg farm dating to the early 1100s. It is not known when the church went out of use, but Bratsberg farm burned down in 1156. in 1576, Peder Clauss√∏n Friis reviewed it as a ruin. The site was first excavated in 1901. In 1928, Gerhard Fischer undertook restoration and preservation. The work was completed in 1933. Transportation =Roads= The main road into Skien is from the E18 road and through Porsgrunn, on either road 36 or 354 that runs up alongs Skienselva on each side. Another common route used by most buses coming from Oslo is road 32, that goes through Siljan, Steinsholt, L√•gendalen, Hvittingfoss and Hof. Road 32 enters the E18 in Hof. 564598-168 =Water= Skien is the main terminus for the Telemark Canal. The \\"Norsj√∏-Skienskanalen\\" section of the canal, with one terminus at Skien and the other at L√∏veid, was built in 1854-1861\\\\. In Europe, canals were commonly built in the pre-railroad period to transport goods, timber, and passengers. The \\"Porsgrunn river\\" runs from the lock at Skien through Porsgrunn to the Frierfjord. Skien harbour is located at Vold havneterminal. =Railroads= Skien was connected to the Norwegian railway network (Vestfoldbanen) in 1882. In 1919, Bratsbergbanen opened between Skien and Notodden. Norges Statsbaner still operates regular train services on both railways. =Air= The local airport is Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. It serves domestic flights to Bergen and Stavanger as well as flights to Trondheim by the airline Vildanden. For the present, no commercial flights are operated from Geiteryggen. Culture and recreation Skien Church Skien videreg√•ende skole - Brekkeby =Ibsen and Telemark Museums= Skien was the birthplace of the author and playwright Henrik Ibsen, probably the most important writer to emerge from Norway. Many of Ibsen's plays are set in an unnamed provincial town that suggests Skien. The former Ibsen family homestead at Venst√∏p outside Skien was established as the Ibsen Museum in 1958. The Ibsen Museum has now been incorporated into the multi-site Telemark Museum, which includes several other historical sites. =Music and entertainment= Ibsenhuset is the local culture and conference center in Skien. It also houses concerts by international and national artists, opera, theatre and other cultural events. Skien kunstforening has a department in Ibsenhuset, and the local culture school and library are also located in the building. The venue is also home to the regional symphony orchestra, Grenland Symfoniorkester. Teater Ibsen is the city theatre, and is still used for small productions. Skien Church is the largest church in Telemark county, and is famous for its two twin towers and great organ. In the summer of 2009 Elton John held a concert at the new Skagerak Arena, the soccer pitch for the local soccer team Odd Grenland. Next to Skagerak Arena is Stevneplassen, where car shows, concerts, flea markets and the annual \\"Handelsstevnet\\" ‚Äì a trade fair with entertainment and a small amusement park ‚Äì are held. The Handelsstevnet was closed down after the annual fair in 2011. In Skotfoss, a small suburb of Skien further up the Telemark Canal, concerts are held at L√∏veid Sluser. There are plans to hold cultural events and concerts at Kloster√∏ya (a downtown graffiti park). =Amusement parks= There are no local amusement parks in Skien. Lekeland was a small amusement park for children just outside the town, but it closed in 2008. Every year there is a traveling carnival with rides and merry-go-arounds for a week, in \\"Stevneplassen\\". Norway's biggest outside climbing park, Himalaya Park, is located in Skien. There is an indoor waterpark in Skien Fritidspark. =Media= The daily newspapers Varden and Telemarksavisa are published in Skien. The local television for Telemark, TVTelemark, is located in Skien. Economy =Commerce and industry= The largest industries are ABB Asea Brown Boveri (engineering firm), Norske Skog Union (a paper mill which was closed down in the spring of 2006), and EFD Induction (induction heating and induction welding). Other important places of work are the Telemark Hospital and the County Governor of Telemark. Agder Court of Appeal is located in Skien. Because the E18 highway lies outside of the metropolitan area of Grenland, Skien has lost many important companies to the cities in Vestfold. =Shopping= Skien has three shopping malls: *Handelsbyen Herkules (110 stores and services) *Arkaden Skien Storsenter (47 stores and services) *Lietorvet Senter (28 stores and services) Sports =Arenas= *Gjerpenhallen *M√¶lahallen *Skagerak Arena *Skienshallen *Skien Ishall *Skien Isstadion =Clubs= *Gjerpen IF (handball) *Odds Ballklubb (football) *Sceen Curling Klubb (curling) *Skien Ishockeyklubb (ice hockey) *Tollnes Ballklubb (football) *Moflata table tennis (table tennis) *Skien Innebandyklubb (Floorball) Notable people International relations =Twin towns and sister cities= The following cities are twinned with Skien: * Loimaa, Southwest Finland, Finland * Minot, North Dakota, United States * Mosfellsb√¶r, Iceland * One»ôti, BacƒÉu County, Romania * Sorrento, Campania, Italy * Thisted, Region Nordjylland, Denmark * Uddevalla, V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden References External links *Municipal fact sheet from Statistics Norway Municipal website *Municipal website *Municipal website Municipalities of Vestfold og Telemark Cities and towns in Norway ","title":"Skien"},{"id":"178298","text":"Notodden () is a city and municipality in Vestfold og Telemark county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of √òst-Telemark. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Notodden. Notodden was separated from the municipality of Heddal in 1913 to become a separate city and municipality. On 1 January 1964, the rural municipalities of Heddal and Gransherad were merged into Notodden to form a new enlarged municipality. Notodden is on the shore of Heddalsvatnet lake, and the Tinn River runs through the town into the lake. Norway's biggest stave church, Heddal Stave Church, can be seen a few kilometres from the city centre. Notodden Airport, Tuven, is located west of the city centre. Norsk Hydro was founded in this town. Notodden is well known for the annual Notodden Blues Festival, which is considered one of the best blues festivals in Europe. It also has a well-known metal festival called Motst√∏y Festivalen. The football club Notodden FK is headquartered here.  Name  The name \\"Notodden\\" comes from the cotter's place (husmannsplass) Notodden that belonged to the farm Tinne g√•rd‚Äînear the mouth of the river Tinnelva close to the lake Heddalsvatnet.Nilsen, Jan Erik; Lundbo, Sten; Selland, Svein-Gunnar: Notodden in Store norske leksikon at snl.no. Accessed 18 October 2020 at https://snl.no/Notodden The first element of the name is not which means \\"to fish using a seine\\" and the last element is the finite form of odde meaning \\"headland\\". Thus the general meaning of the name is \\"the fishing place\\".  Coat-of-arms  The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 11 August 1939. The arms show a silver- colored river and four lightning strikes. One of the first hydroelectric power stations in Norway was established in the late 19th century at the Tinnfoss waterfall on the Tinn River.  Twin towns  In 2008, Notodden city council decided to end the twin city agreements with Ilisalmi, Nyk√∂ping and Stelle. At the same time Suwa≈Çki was approved as a new twin city. The following cities are twinned with Notodden: * Clarksdale, Mississippi, United States * Suwa≈Çki, Podlaskie Voivodeship, Poland Former twin cities of Notodden: * Iisalmi, Eastern Finland, Finland * Nyk√∂ping, S√∂dermanland County, Sweden * Stelle, Lower Saxony, Germany  Notable residents  Notodden is the hometown of organist K√•re Nordstoga, the internationally known author Hans Herbj√∏rnsrud who was born in Heddal, and the Hardanger fiddlemaker Olav Gunnarsson Helland (1875‚Äì1939) who many consider the finest of the twentieth century. Composer Klaus Egge, born 1906 in Gransherad, also lived in Notodden. Olympic gold medalist √Ödne S√∏ndr√•l was born in Notodden. American blues musician Seasick Steve, who is achieving fame in the United Kingdom, currently resides in Notodden. Norwegian blues musician Margit Bakken and painter and author Tor- Arne Moen also live in Notodden. One of the most influential Norwegian black metal bands, Emperor, came from Notodden, as does Mortiis, Peccatum, Star of Ash, Leprous, and Zyklon. Emperor's singer, Ihsahn, still resides in Notodden.

It is part of the traditional region of Grenland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Langesund. General information =Name= The Old Norse form of the name was Bamblar (a plural form). The name could be related to the word bembel m 'belly' (used in the meaning 'round hill/mountain'). The name was written \\"Bamle\\" in the period 1889‚Äì1917. See also the name B√∏mlo. =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 12 December 1986. The arms show a gold-colored ship's wheel on a blue background. The arms are nearly identical to the former arms of Stathelle, which along with Langesund was merged with the municipality of Bamble on 1 January 1964. Sailing and fishing have always been of great importance for the area, and a ship's wheel was thus an appropriate symbol. Bamble Church History The municipality of Bamble was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The lading place of Stathelle was separated from the municipality of Bamble in 1851. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Bamble was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Stathelle and Langesund. The new municipality was named Bamble, the administrative centre was Langesund, and the coat-of-arms of Stathelle were used for the new municipality. Bamble, lying at the southern tip of the Kongsberg-Bamble geological formation, also has a unique geology that has been extensively researched by geologists such as W. C. Br√∏gger. It exhibits a high grade gneiss terrane characterized by metasomatism. As such there have been many mines operating in the area, most notably the √òdeg√•rden Verk apatite mines and the nickel mines in Nystein. Bamble Church (Bamble kirke) is located at E18 south of Grenland Bridge. It is a wooden cruciform church which was built in 1845. The church is located next to the ruins of Olav Church which dated to around 1145.

It is part of the traditional regions of Upper Telemark and √òst- Telemark. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Rjukan. The parish of Tin(d) was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The area of Hovin was separated from the municipality of Tinn in 1860, but it was merged back into the municipality of Tinn on 1 January 1964. Krossobanen is the oldest aerial tramway in Northern Europe. It was built in 1928 as a gift from Norsk Hydro. There is a museum and Hardangervidda National Park center at the lake M√∏svatn close to Tinn. General information =Name= The Old Norse form of the name was Tinnr. It is probably the old name of the Lake Tinn, the central lake in the municipality. The meaning of the name is unknown. =Coat-of-arms= The coat- of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 18 November 1994. The arms show five blue drops of water on a silver background. It was chosen to represent the five rivers in the municipality and the hydropower of Rjukan. It was designed by Halvor Holtskog. History Rjukan Falls on the M√•na river allowed construction of Vemork, the largest power station in the world in 1911. The station has become a museum where one can explore the history of the energy and see exhibits about the industrial development in Norway and at Rjukan, the municipality center of Tinn. The museum is most famous for its presentation of Rjukan's war history. During World War II, Vemork was the site of the Norwegian heavy water sabotage, when Norwegian saboteurs prevented the Germans from producing nuclear weapons from the heavy water which was produced here. The exhibit Atomkappl√∏pet (\\"The nuclear race\\") presents the four heavy water sabotages and the allied efforts to develop a nuclear bomb. Geography The municipality borders the municipality of Nore og Uvdal (in Buskerud county) to the north, Rollag and Flesberg (also in Buskerud) to the east, Notodden, Hjartdal, and Seljord to the south, and Vinje to the west. Tinn stretches deeply into the Hardangervidda landscape. One landmark in Tinn is the tall mountain Gaustatoppen, which is climbed by 30,000 people each year.

His works include the ballets Copp√©lia (1870) and Sylvia (1876) and the opera Lakm√© (1883). Born into a musical family, Delibes enrolled at France's foremost music academy, the Conservatoire de Paris, when he was twelve, studying under several professors including Adolphe Adam. After composing light comic op√©rettes in the 1850s and 1860s, while also serving as a church organist, Delibes achieved public recognition for his music for the ballet La Source in 1866. His later ballets Copp√©lia and Sylvia were key works in the development of modern ballet, giving the music much greater importance than previously. He composed a small number of m√©lodies, some of which are still performed frequently. Delibes had several attempts at writing more serious operas, and achieved a considerable critical and commercial success in 1883 with Lakm√©. In his later years he joined the faculty of the Conservatoire, teaching composition. He died at his home in Paris at the age of 54. Copp√©lia and Sylvia remain core works in the international ballet repertoire, and Lakm√© is revived from time to time in opera houses. Life and career =Early years= Delibes was born in Saint-Germain-du-Val, now part of La Fl√®che (Sarthe), on 21 February 1836;Curzon, p. 7 his father worked for the French postal service and his mother was a talented amateur musician, the daughter of an opera singer and niece of the organist √âdouard Batiste.Macdonald, Hugh. \\"Delibes, (Cl√©ment Philibert) L√©o\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001. Retrieved 12 January 2020 Delibes was the couple's only child. His father died in 1847 and the family moved to Paris, where soon after his twelfth birthday Delibes was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire.Darcours, Charles. \\"L√©o Delibes\\", Le Figaro, 17 January 1891, p. 1 (in French) He studied first with Antoine-Jules Tariot (music theory), and then with F√©lix Le Couppey (piano), Fran√ßois Benoist (organ), Fran√ßois Bazin (harmony) and, at eighteen, Adolphe Adam (composition).Curzon, p. 9 As a boy, Delibes had an unusually fine singing voice; he was a chorister at the church of La Madeleine and sang in the premi√®re of Meyerbeer's Le proph√®te at the Paris Op√©ra in 1849. While still a student Delibes became organist of and accompanist at the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique. At the latter he took part in the preparation of most of the operas in the theatre's repertoire, including classics such as The Marriage of Figaro and Fidelio and new works such as Louis Clapisson's La Fanchonnette, Victor Mass√©'s La Reine Topaze and Gounod's Faust. His biographer Hugh Macdonald writes that although Delibes remained a church organist until 1871 (he held several posts, the last of them at the church of Saint Jean-Saint Fran√ßois from 1862), he was \\"clearly drawn more to the theatre [and] found his m√©tier at Herv√©'s highly successful Folies-Nouvelles\\". =Composer= In 1856 Delibes' first stage work was premiered at the Folies-Nouvelles: Deux sous de charbon (Two sous-worth of coal), a one-act comic piece to a libretto by Jules Moinaux, described as an \\"asphyxie lyrique\\".Curzon, p. 13 Over the next fourteen years he produced more comic operas, at an average rate of about one a year. Many were written for the Bouffes-Parisiens, the theatre run by Jacques Offenbach, including Deux vieilles gardes (\\"Two Old Guards\\"), Delibes's second opera, which enjoyed enormous success, attributable in Macdonald's view to the composer's gift for \\"witty melody and lightness of touch\\". La Source, 1866 In addition to composing, Delibes earned a living as a critic (briefly in 1858); inspector of school music; and accompanist and later chorus master at the Op√©ra (from 1862 or 1863).. His appointment at the Op√©ra led to a new career as a composer of ballet music. In 1866 he was commissioned to compose two acts of La Source, the other two being written by Ludwig Minkus. In the view of the musicologist and critic Adolphe Jullien, Delibes \\"displayed such a wealth of melody as a composer of ballet music\\" that Minkus was \\"completely eclipsed\\".Jullien, p. 687 Delibes was immediately invited to compose a waltz-divertissement called Le Pas de Fleurs to be introduced into the ballet of his former teacher Adam, Le Corsaire, for a revival in 1867. The piece was later incorporated into Delibes' music for La Source when it was revived.Grymes, James (2015). Notes to Hyperion CD CDA6796 In 1869 Delibes composed his last op√©rette, La Cour du roi P√©taud, for the Vari√©t√©s.Curzon, p. 88 The following year he came to wider public notice with his score for the ballet Copp√©lia, first performed at the Op√©ra in May 1870. It was an immediate success, and has remained among the most popular works in the classical ballet repertoire. The following year he resigned from the musical staff of the Op√©ra and devoted himself wholly to composition. In that year he married L√©ontine Estelle Denain.Curzon, p. 118 Not wishing to be typecast as a ballet composer, Delibes next turned to m√©lodies. In 1872 he published a collection including the songs \\"Myrto\\", \\"Les Filles de Cadiz\\" and \\"Bonjour Suzon\\".Johnson, p. 129; and Curzon, p. 53 In 1873 he produced at the Op√©ra-Comique a comic opera in three acts, Le Roi l'a dit (The King has Said It). Le Figaro thought the libretto weak, but praised Delibes' music: \\"his melodic vein, his impeccable taste, his scenic skill, his beautiful humour saved a work which, without him, would have gone unnoticed\\". The work was a success in Paris and in German opera houses, but did not establish itself in the international repertory. Its first performances in Britain (1894) and the US (2016) were by students of, respectively, the Royal College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music.\\"Le Roi l'a dit\\", The Era, 15 December 1894, p. 7; and \\"Le Roi l'a dit\\", Opera News, June 2016 Delibes returned to the Op√©ra in 1876, with a grand mythological ballet, Sylvia, which in Jullien's view confirmed Delibes' superiority in dance music. It was well received by the press and public. In 1877 Delibes was made a Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur. Despite the success of his two ballets, Delibes was still anxious to write a serious vocal work, and composed a grand scena, La Mort d'Orph√©e (The Death of Orpheus), given at the Trocad√©ro Concerts in 1878 during the Exposition Universelle.\\"Leo Delibes\\", The Musical World, 24 January 1891, pp. 69‚Äì70 He followed that with a serious opera, Jean de Nivelle, a medieval patriotic romance, premiered at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1880. Reviewers found the piece too episodic but praised the composer for \\"the rare and precise quality\\" of his melodies and \\"the delicate style in his writing\\" for the public. The Parisian critic for The Era considered it \\"the best opera, the one most likely to attain a world-wide popularity, since Bizet's ...Carmen\\", premiered five years previously.\\"The Drama in Paris\\", The Era, 14 March 1880, p. 7 The piece ran for more than a hundred performances, and was revived in Paris in 1908 but has not (in 2020) been staged there since then.Pottinger, Mark. \\"L√©o Delibes, Jean de Nivelle: Dossier de presse parisienne\\", Music and Letters, August 2008, pp. 434‚Äì435 =Later years= In 1881 Delibes succeeded Napol√©on Henri Reber as professor of composition at the Conservatoire, despite his own admission that he knew nothing of fugue and counterpoint. He took his duties with great seriousness. The music critic Charles Darcours recalled Delibes' concern for his students and his anxiety for them to succeed in France's most prestigious musical award, the Prix de Rome. In 1882 Delibes composed incidental music for a revival of Victor Hugo's play Le Roi s'amuse at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, consisting of a suite of pastiche medieval dances for orchestra (\\"Six airs de danse dans le style ancien\\") and a song with mandolin accompaniment (\\"Quand Bourbon vit Marseille\\").Curzon, pp. 175‚Äì176 Delibes' opera Lakm√© was premiered at the Op√©ra-Comique on 14 April 1883. L√©on Carvalho, the manager, was not known for extravagance in his productions, but for this opera he surprised his audiences by the lavish staging.\\"'Lakme' in Paris\\", The Era, 21 April 1881, p. 7 Macdonald writes: Grave in the Cimeti√®re de Montmartre Lakm√© was quickly taken up by opera houses across Europe, and productions followed in London (1885) and New York (1886); reviews of the American production were highly enthusiastic; those of the British production were less so, but in both cities it prospered at the box-office.\\"Lakm√© at the Gaiety\\", The Musical World, 13 June 1885, p. 364 \\"'Lakm√©' in New York\\", The Orchestra Musical Review, 27 March 1886, p. 620 Delibes' last years were financially comfortable and socially secure. In 1884 he was elected to the Institut de France. His last work, incomplete when he died, was another opera, Kassya. Delibes, who had been intermittently ill for some time, died at his home in Paris after a sudden collapse shortly before his 55th birthday. He was buried in the Cimeti√®re de Montmartre in Paris. Music In Macdonald's view, Delibes' early compositions are clearly influenced by and in the tradition of Boieldieu, H√©rold and Adam, Delibes' composition teacher at the Conservatoire, from whom he had the example of \\"a sparkling operetta style\\". Later, consciously seeking to move from light popular works into a more elevated genre, his works show the influence of Meyerbeer and Gounod, as well as the slightly younger Bizet and Lalo. Macdonald observes that in notices of Delibes' early music the same terms frequently recur: \\"wit, charm, elegance, grace, colour, lightness\\". The Musical World said of him, \\"If not the greatest French composer of his day, Delibes was the most characteristically French, and it can hardly be said that in his own line he leaves any successor of equal excellence\\". =Opera= Le Roi l'a dit is a light opera in which \\"elaborate vocal ensembles and witty pastiche play a major part\\" (Macdonald). The more serious Jean de Nivelle, one of the works showing the influence of Meyerbeer and Lalo, is generally weightier in tone, with some lapses into the composer's lighter style in such pieces as the Act III couplets, \\"Moi! j'aime le bruit de bataille\\". The chorus \\"Nous sommes les reines d'un jour\\" in the Act I finale continually switches between and with what Macdonald calls \\"a modal melody of striking originality\\". Lakm√©, Act I, 1883 Lakm√© ‚Äì which Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians ranks as Delibes' masterpiece, even above Coppelia and Sylvia ‚Äì shows the influence of Bizet, with echoes of Carmen and Les p√™cheurs de perles in the harmonic techniques and subtleties of orchestration. The opera is sometimes seen as a vehicle for a star soprano, but Macdonald writes that the two principal male characters, Nilakantha and G√©rald, are strongly drawn, and the music is \\"melodic, picturesque and theatrically strong\\". Macdonald expresses reservations about the dramatic recitative, which he finds tending to the conventional; the work was originally conceived as an op√©ra-comique with spoken dialogue, and the recitatives were an afterthought.\\"Waifs\\", The Musical World, 4 August 1883, p. 486 Lakm√© remains on the fringes of the operatic repertoire. It was produced at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1995, starring Natalie Dessay,Stevens, David. \\"Picture Book Lakm√©, New York Times, 22 February 1995 \\"Lakm√©\\", Les Archives du spectacle.

L√©o\\", The International Encyclopedia of Dance, Oxford University Press, 2005. Retrieved 14 January 2020 Delibes made extensive use of characteristic national dances, including the bolero, czardas, jig and mazurka, continually interspersed with waltz rhythms. In the opinion of several critics, the score of Sylvia surpasses that of Copp√©lia. Tchaikovsky was greatly impressed by it, calling Sylvia: Carl Van Vechten shared Tchaikovsky's view that Delibes revolutionised ballet composition: \\"Before he began to compose his ballets, music for dancing, for the most part, consisted of tinkle-tinkle melodies with marked rhythm.\\" In Van Vechten's view, Delibes revolutionised ballet music by introducing in his scores \\"a symphonic element, a wealth of graceful melody, and a richness of harmonic fibre, based, it is safe to hazard, on a healthy distaste for routine\\". Van Vechten considers Delibes' scores to be the forerunners of 20th-century ballets such as Debussy's Jeux, Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo√© and Stravinsky's Petrouchka. After Sylvia, Delibes's only composition for dance was a suite of six dances for the Com√©die-fran√ßaise production of Le Roi s'amuse, The dances, in a pastiche of antique style, show a keen ear for the nuances of period character in Goodwin's view. They are not often played in concert and are more familiar in recordings. =M√©lodies= The pianist and musical scholar Graham Johnson quotes the musicologist Fritz Noske's view that Delibes' songs derive from the chansonnette, \\"lighter and more entertaining than the romance, and less susceptible to the German influence of the lied\\". In his songs, Delibes shares with Bizet \\"a natural feeling for the theatre, and an ability to spin local colour\\", as in his chanson espagnole \\"Les filles de Cadix\\". Of other early songs, Johnson describes \\"Eclogue\\" and \\"Bonjour, Suzon\\" as \\"charm[ing] us with their unpretentious gaiety and delicacy, as well as their economy of means\\". Some of the songs evoke the period style of the 16th century, such as \\"Avril\\", \\"Chanson de l'oiseleur\\" and \\"Myrto\\", the last of which is a pre-echo of m√©lodies by Gabriel Faur√©. Johnson finds Delibes more suited to reflective than to passionate sentiments, and, in general, better in more of his earlier songs than his later. He brackets Delibes with his junior contemporary Reynaldo Hahn as songwriters ‚Äì \\"charmers both [with] a similarly eighteenth- century idea of the role of music in refined society: the unashamed giving of pleasure\\".Johnson, pp. 129‚Äì130 Notes, references and sources =Notes= =References= =Sources=   External links *List of works by Delibes at the Index to Opera and Ballet Sources Online  Ballet Notes: \\"L√©o Delibes\\" 1836 births 1891 deaths 19th-century classical composers 19th-century French composers 19th- century male musicians Burials at Montmartre Cemetery Conservatoire de Paris alumni French ballet composers French classical composers French male classical composers French opera composers French operetta composers French Romantic composers Male opera composers People from La Fl√®che Prix de Rome for composition Pupils of Adolphe Adam Pupils of Fran√ßois Benoist ","title":"L√©o Delibes"},{"id":"178310","title":"Heathen Chemistry"},{"id":"178311","text":"Saint Teresa by Giuseppe Bazzani Religious ecstasy is a type of altered state of consciousness characterized by greatly reduced external awareness and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness, frequently accompanied by visions and emotional (and sometimes physical) euphoria.

The Cresset Press, London, 1961. p. 57 there are records of such experiences lasting several days or even more, and of recurring experiences of ecstasy during one's lifetime.

Context The religious ecstasy of Saint Teresa of Avila of the Carmelite Order The adjective \\"religious\\" means that the experience occurs in connection with religious activities or is interpreted in context of a religion. Journalist Marghanita Laski writes in her study \\"Ecstasy in Religious and Secular Experiences\\", first published in 1961: > \\"Epithets are very often applied to mystical experiences including ecstasies > without, apparently, any clear idea about the distinctions that are being > made.

History =Ancient= Yoga provides techniques to attain an ecstasy state called samƒÅdhi. According to practitioners, there are various stages of ecstasy, the highest being Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Bhakti Yoga especially, places emphasis on ecstasy as being one of the fruits of its practice. In Buddhism, especially in the Pali Canon, there are eight states of trance also called absorption. The first four states are Rupa or, materially-oriented. The next four are Arupa or non-material. These eight states are preliminary trances which lead up to final saturation. In Visuddhimagga, great effort and years of sustained meditation are practiced to reach the first absorption, and that not all individuals are able to accomplish it at all. In the Dionysian Mysteries of ancient Greece, initiates used intoxicants, ecstatic dance and music to remove inhibitions and social constraints. =Modern= Modern meditator experiences in the Thai Forest Tradition, as well as other Theravadan traditions, demonstrates that this effort and rarity is necessary only to become completely immersed in the absorptions and experience no other sensations. It is possible to experience the absorptions in a less intense state with much less practice. In the monotheistic tradition, ecstasy is usually associated with communion and oneness with God. However, such experiences can also be personal mystical experiences with no significance to anyone but the person experiencing them. Some charismatic Christians practice ecstatic states (such as \\"being slain in the Spirit\\") and interpret these as given by the Holy Spirit. The firewalkers of Greece dance themselves into a state of ecstasy at the annual Anastenaria, when they believe themselves under the influence of Saint Constantine.Xygalatas, Dimitris, \\"Firewalking and the Brain: The Physiology of High-Arousal Rituals\\", in: Joseph Bulbulia, Richard Sosis, Erica Harris, Russell Genet, Cheryl Genet, and Karen Wyman (eds.)

Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in New England. 1743 In response to claims that all emotional expressions of religious ecstasy were attacks on order and theological soundness from the Devil, Jonathan Edwards published his influential Treatise on Religious Affections. Here, he argues, religious ecstasy could come from oneself, the Devil, or God, and it was only by observing the fruit, or changes in inner thought and behaviour, that one could determine if the religious ecstasy had come from God. In modern Pentecostal, charismatic and spirit-filled Christianity, numerous examples of religious ecstasy have transpired, similar to historic revivals. These occurrences however, have changed significantly since the time of the Toronto Blessing phenomena and several other North American so-called revivals and outpourings from the mid 1990s. From that time, religious ecstasy in these movements has been characterized by increasingly unusual behaviors that are understood by adherents to be the anointing of the holy spirit and evidence of God 'doing a new work'. One of the most controversial and strange examples is that of spiritual birthing http://www.spiritwatch.org/fireimpart.htm \\\\- a practice during which women, and at times even men, claim to be having actual contractions of the womb while they moan and retch as though experiencing childbirth.http://www.visionintlm.com/articles_view.asp?columnid=5958&articleid;=66581 It is said to be a prophetic action bringing spiritual blessings from God into the world. Many believe spiritual birthing to be highly demonic in nature and more occult-like than Christian. Religious ecstasy in these Christian movements has also been witnessed in the form of squealing, shrieking, an inability to stand or sit, uttering apocalyptic prophecies, holy laughter, crying and barking. Some people have made dramatic claims of sighting 'gold dust', 'angel feathers', 'holy clouds', or the spontaneous appearance of precious gem stones during ecstatic worship events.http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/demoniac-false-preacher-todd-bentley- says-angel-feathers-manifesting-at-revival-meetings/ Others have claimed to have received spontaneous gold tooth fillings. The Range Christian Fellowship in the conservative Australian city of Toowoomba demonstrates such displays of religious ecstasy on an almost weekly basis. In addition to all of the above, worshippers there also use textile banners and during moments of religious ecstasy believe these banners carry special powers of 'anointing' as a result of divinely inspired artwork.http://www.worshipbanners.com.au/docs/an- introduction-to-banners-12.pdf The Ecstasy of St. Catherine of Siena by Pompeo Batoni In hagiography (writings about Christian saints) many instances are recorded in which saints are granted ecstasies. According to the Catholic EncyclopediaEcstasy religious ecstasy (called \\"supernatural ecstasy\\") includes two elements: one, interior and invisible, in which the mind rivets its attention on a religious subject, and another, corporeal and visible, in which the activity of the senses is suspended, reducing the effect of external sensations upon the subject and rendering him or her resistant to awakening. The witnesses of a Marian apparition often describe experiencing these elements of ecstasy. Modern Witchcraft traditions may define themselves as \\"ecstatic traditions\\", and focus on reaching ecstatic states in their rituals. The Reclaiming Tradition and the Feri Tradition are two modern ecstatic Witchcraft examples.M. Macha Nightmare, \\"Reclaiming Tradition Witchcraft\\", Witchvox, 2001.

Masts do not suffer from what may be called a disease.

He earned his greatest recognition after leading his army against Napoleon I at the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig in 1813 and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Bl√ºcher was born in Rostock, the son of a retired army captain. His military career began in 1758 as a hussar in the Swedish Army. He was captured by the Prussians in 1760 during the Pomeranian Campaign and thereafter joined the Prussian Army, serving as a hussar officer for Prussia during the remainder of the Seven Years' War. In 1773, Bl√ºcher was forced to resign by Frederick the Great for insubordination. He worked as a farmer until the death of Frederick in 1786, when Bl√ºcher was reinstated and promoted to colonel. For his success in the French Revolutionary Wars, Bl√ºcher became a major general in 1794. He became a lieutenant general in 1801 and commanded the cavalry corps during the Napoleonic Wars in 1806. War broke out between Prussia and France again in 1813 and Bl√ºcher returned to active service at the age of 71. He was appointed full general over the Prussian field forces and clashed with Napoleon at the Battles of L√ºtzen and Bautzen. Later he won a critical victory over the French at the Battle of Katzbach. Bl√ºcher commanded the Prussian Army of Silesia at the Battle of the Nations where Napoleon was decisively defeated. For his role, Bl√ºcher was made a field marshal and received his title of Prince of Wahlstatt. After Napoleon‚Äôs return in 1815, Bl√ºcher took command of the Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine and coordinated his force with that of the British and Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington. At the Battle of Ligny, he was severely injured and the Prussians retreated. After recovering, Bl√ºcher resumed command and joined Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, with the intervention of Bl√ºcher's army playing a decisive role in the final allied victory. Bl√ºcher was made an honorary citizen of Berlin, Hamburg and Rostock. Known for his fiery personality, he was nicknamed Marschall Vorw√§rts (\\"Marshal Forward\\") by his soldiers because of his aggressive approach in warfare. Along with Paul von Hindenburg, he was the most highly decorated Prussian-German soldier in history: Bl√ºcher and Hindenburg are the only Prussian-German military officers to have been awarded the Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross. A statue once stood in the square that bore his name, Bl√ºcherplatz in Breslau.Swedish Encyclopedia \\"Nordisk Familjebok\\", vol 4, article \\"Breslau\\", column 112, see ; Swedish \\"Andra √∂ppna plater √§ro Bl√ºcherplatz med Bl√ºchers staty,...\\"(found left of \\"Brescia\\" in column 111); means \\"Other open places are Bl√ºcherplatz with Bl√ºchers' statue,...\\" Biography =Early life= Bl√ºcher was born on 16 December 1742 in Rostock, a Baltic port in northern Germany, then in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His father was a retired army captain, and his family belonged to the nobility and had been landowners in northern Germany since at least the 13th century. He began his military career at the age of 16, when he joined the Swedish Army as a hussar. At the time, Sweden was at war with Prussia in the Seven Years' War. Bl√ºcher took part in the Pomeranian campaign of 1760, where Prussian hussars captured him in a skirmish. The colonel of the Prussian regiment, Wilhelm Sebastian von Belling (a distant relative), was impressed with the young hussar and had him join his own regiment. Bl√ºcher took part in the later battles of the Seven Years' War, and as a hussar officer, gained much experience in light cavalry work. In peace, however, his ardent spirit led him into excesses of all kinds, such as the mock execution of a priest suspected of supporting Polish uprisings in 1772. As a result, he was passed over for promotion to major. Bl√ºcher submitted a rude letter of resignation in 1773, which Frederick the Great replied to with \\"Captain Bl√ºcher can take himself to the devil\\" (1773). Bl√ºcher settled down to farming. Within 15 years, he had acquired financial independence and had become a Freemason. During Frederick the Great's lifetime, Bl√ºcher could not return to the army. However, the monarch died in 1786, and the following year, Bl√ºcher was reinstated as a major in his old regiment, the Red Hussars. He took part in the expedition to the Netherlands in 1787, and the next year was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1789, he received Prussia's highest military order, the Pour le M√©rite, and in 1794, he became colonel of the Red Hussars. In 1793 and 1794, Bl√ºcher distinguished himself in cavalry actions against the French, and for his victory at Kirrweiler on 28 May 1794, he was promoted to major general. In 1801, he was made a lieutenant general. =Napoleonic Wars= Marschall Vorw√§rts by Emil H√ºnten (1863) Bl√ºcher was one of the leaders of the war party in Prussia in 1805, and he served as a cavalry general in the disastrous campaign of 1806. At the double Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Bl√ºcher fought at Auerstedt, repeatedly leading the charges of the Prussian cavalry, but without success. During the retreat of the broken armies, he commanded the rearguard composed of Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe's corps. With the capitulation of the main body after the Battle of Prenzlau on 28 October, he found his march toward the north-east blocked. He led the remnant of his corps away to the north-west. Reinforcing his numbers with a division previously commanded by Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Bl√ºcher and his new chief of staff, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, reorganised his forces into two small corps totaling 21,000 men and 44 cannons. Nevertheless, he was defeated by two French corps at the Battle of L√ºbeck on 6 November. The next day, trapped against the Danish frontier by 40,000 French troops, he was compelled to surrender with less than 10,000 soldiers at Ratekau. Bl√ºcher insisted that clauses be written in the capitulation document that he had had to surrender due to lack of provisions and ammunition, and that his soldiers should be honoured by a French formation along the street. He was allowed to keep his sabre and to move freely, bound only by his word of honour, and was soon exchanged for future Marshal Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno, and was actively employed in Pomerania, at Berlin, and at K√∂nigsberg until the conclusion of the war. After the war, Bl√ºcher was looked upon as the natural leader of the Patriot Party, with which he was in close touch during the period of Napoleonic domination, but his hopes of an alliance with Austria in the war of 1809 were disappointed. In this year, he was made general of cavalry. In 1812, he expressed himself so openly on the alliance of Russia with France that he was recalled from his military governorship of Pomerania and virtually banished from the court. Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher in Bautzen by Bogdan Willewalde (1885) Following the start of the War of Liberation in the spring of 1813, Bl√ºcher was again placed in high command, and he was present at L√ºtzen and Bautzen. During the summer truce, he worked on the organisation of the Prussian forces; when the war was resumed, he became commander-in-chief of the Army of Silesia, with August von Gneisenau and Karl von M√ºffling as his principal staff officers and 40,000 Prussians and 50,000 Russians under his command during the autumn campaign. The most conspicuous military quality displayed by Bl√ºcher was his unrelenting energy. The irresolution and divergence of interests usual in Sixth Coalition armies found in him a restless opponent. Knowing that if he could not induce others to co-operate, he was prepared to attempt the task at hand by himself, which often caused other generals to follow his lead. He defeated Marshal MacDonald at the Katzbach, and by his victory over Marshal Marmont at M√∂ckern led the way to the decisive defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig. Bl√ºcher's own army stormed Leipzig on the evening of the last day of the battle. This was the fourth battle between Napoleon and Bl√ºcher, and the first that Bl√ºcher had won. On the day of M√∂ckern (16 October 1813), Bl√ºcher was made a field marshal, and after the victory, he pursued the French with his accustomed energy. In the winter of 1813‚Äì1814, Bl√ºcher, with his chief staff officers, was mainly instrumental in inducing the Coalition sovereigns to carry the war into France itself. Old Blucher Beating the Corsican Big Drum, George Cruikshank, 8 April 1814 The Battle of Brienne and the Battle of La Rothi√®re were the chief incidents of the first stage of the celebrated 1814 campaign in north-east France, and they were quickly followed by victories of Napoleon over Bl√ºcher at Champaubert, Vauchamps, and Montmirail. The courage of the Prussian leader was undiminished, though, and his victory against the vastly outnumbered French, at Laon (9 and 10 March) practically decided the fate of the campaign. However, his health had been severely affected by the strains of the previous two months, and he now suffered a breakdown, during which he lost his sight and suffered a delusion that a Frenchman had impregnated him with an elephant. Dominic Lieven wrote that the breakdown, \\"revealed the fragility of the coalition armies' command structure and just how much the Army of Silesia had depended on Bl√ºcher's drive, courage, and charisma.... The result was that for more than a week after the battle of Laon, the Army of Silesia... played no useful role in the war\\". After this, Bl√ºcher infused some of his energy into the operations of the Prince Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia, and at last this army and the Army of Silesia marched in one body directly towards Paris. The victory of Montmartre, the entry of the allies into the French capital, and the overthrow of the First Empire were the direct consequences. Bl√ºcher was in favour of punishing the city of Paris severely for the sufferings of Prussia at the hands of the French armies, but the allied commanders intervened. According to the Duke of Wellington, one of Bl√ºcher's plans involved blowing up the Jena Bridge near the Champ de Mars: In gratitude for his victories in 1814, King Frederick William III of Prussia created Bl√ºcher Prince (F√ºrst) of Wahlstatt (in Silesia on the Katzbach battlefield). The king also awarded him estates near Krieblowitz (now Krobielowice, Poland) in Lower Silesia and a grand mansion at 2, Pariser Platz in Berlin (which in 1930 became the Embassy of the United States, Berlin). Soon afterward, Bl√ºcher paid a visit to England, where he was received with royal honours and cheered enthusiastically everywhere he went. When Oxford University granted him an honorary doctorate (doctor of laws), he is supposed to have joked that if he was made a doctor, they should at least make Gneisenau an apothecary; \\"...for if I wrote the prescription, he made the pills.\\" =Hundred Days and later life= The Prussian attack on Plancenoit during the Battle of Waterloo, painted by Adolph Northen After the war, Bl√ºcher retired to Silesia. However, the return of Napoleon from Elba and his entry into Paris at the start of the Hundred Days, called him back to service. He was put in command of the Army of the Lower Rhine, with Gneisenau serving again as his chief of staff. At the outset of the Waterloo Campaign of 1815, the Prussians sustained a serious defeat at Ligny (16 June), in the course of which the old field marshal lay trapped under his dead horse for several hours and was repeatedly ridden over by cavalry, his life saved only by the devotion of his aide-de-camp Count Nostitz, who threw a greatcoat over his commander to obscure Bl√ºcher's rank and identity from the passing French. As Bl√ºcher was unable to resume command for some hours, Gneisenau took command, drew off the defeated army, and rallied it. In spite of Gneisenau's distrust of Wellington, he obeyed Bl√ºcher's last orders to direct the army's retreat towards Wavre, rather than Liege, to keep alive the possibility of joining the Prussian and Wellington's Anglo-allied armies together. After bathing his wounds in a liniment of rhubarb and garlic, and fortified by a liberal internal dose of schnapps, Bl√ºcher rejoined his army. Gneisenau feared that the British had reneged on their earlier agreements and favored a withdrawal, but Bl√ºcher convinced him to send two corps to join Wellington at Waterloo. He then led his army on a tortuous march along muddy paths, arriving on the field of Waterloo in the late afternoon. In spite of his age, the pain of his wounds, and the effort it must have taken for him to remain on horseback, Bernard Cornwell states that several soldiers attested to Bl√ºcher's high spirits and his determination to defeat Napoleon: Wellington meeting close to La Belle Alliance With the battle hanging in the balance, Bl√ºcher's army intervened with decisive and crushing effect, his vanguard drawing off Napoleon's badly needed reserves, and his main body being instrumental in crushing French resistance. This victory led the way to a decisive victory through the relentless pursuit of the French by the Prussians. The two Coalition armies entered Paris on 7 July. Prince Bl√ºcher remained in the French capital for a few months, but his age and infirmities compelled him to retire to his Silesian residence at Krieblowitz. At the invitation of the British government, he made another state visit to England, to be formally thanked for his army and his role in the Waterloo Campaign. When his carriage stopped on Blackheath Hill, overlooking London, he is said to have exclaimed, \\"What a city to sack!\\" He died at Krieblowitz on 12 September 1819, aged 76. After his death, an imposing mausoleum was built for his remains. When Krieblowitz was conquered by the Red Army in 1945, Soviet soldiers broke into the Bl√ºcher mausoleum and scattered the remains. Soviet troops reportedly used his skull as a football. After 1989, some of his profaned remains were taken by a Polish priest and interred in the catacomb of the church in So≈õnica (German: Schosnitz), 3 km from the now Polish Krobielowice. Assessment It was to be said later among the Prussian military that Bl√ºcher established \\"a Prussian way of war\\" that had abiding influence: More generally, Bl√ºcher was a courageous and popular general who \\"had much to be proud of: energy, controlled aggression and a commitment to defeating the enemy army.\\" M.V.

The marshal's grandson, Count Gebhard Bernhard von Bl√ºcher (1799‚Äì1875), was created Prince Bl√ºcher of Wahlstatt (Serene Highness) in Prussia, a hereditary title in primogeniture, the other members of his branch bearing the title count or countess. In 1832, he bought Radu≈à Castle in the Opava District and in 1847 the lands at Wahlstatt, Legnickie Pole, all of which remained in the family until the flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1945, which forced the family into exile in their mansion Havilland Hall in Guernsey, acquired by the 4th prince and his English wife, Evelyn, Princess Bl√ºcher. Later the family moved to Eurasburg, Bavaria. The present head of the House of Bl√ºcher von Wahlstatt is Nicolaus, 8th Prince Bl√ºcher of Wahlstatt (born 1932), the heir apparent is his son, hereditary count Lukas (born 1956).  Legacy  Bl√ºcher monument in front of the University of Rostock's main building, created by Johann Gottfried Schadow in collaboration with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe =Museum= The Rhineland town of Kaub has a museum dedicated to Bl√ºcher, commemorating in particular his crossing the Rhine with the Prussian and Russian armies, on New Year's night 1813‚Äì1814, in pursuit of the French. = Statues = After Bl√ºcher's death, statues were erected to his memory at Berlin, Breslau, Rostock, and Kaub (where his troops crossed the Rhine in pursuit of Napoleon's forces in 1813). Bl√ºcher is honoured with a bust in the Walhalla temple near Regensburg. =Locomotive and Ships= In gratitude for Bl√ºcher's service, George Stephenson, the pioneering British locomotive engineer, named a locomotive after him. The Blucher was named after him, after the original ship was captured by the British and the new owners named it for him. Three ships of the German navy have been named in honour of Bl√ºcher. The first to be so named was the corvette , built at Kiel's Norddeutsche Schiffbau AG (later renamed the Krupp-Germaniawerft) and launched 20 March 1877. Taken out of service after a boiler explosion in 1907, she ended her days as a coal freighter in Vigo, Spain. On 11 April 1908, the Panzerkreuzer SMS Bl√ºcher was launched from the Imperial Shipyard in Kiel. This ship was sunk on 24 January 1915 in the First World War at the Battle of Dogger Bank. The Second World War German heavy cruiser Bl√ºcher was completed in September 1939, and pronounced ready for service on 5 April 1940 after completing a series of sea trials and training exercises. The vessel was sunk four days later near Oslo during the invasion of Norway. =Film Portrayals= Bl√ºcher was played by German actor Otto Geb√ºhr in the 1929 film Waterloo. In 1932, he was the subject of the biographical film Marshal Forwards, in which he was played by Paul Wegener. It was part of a group of Prussian films released during the era. He was portrayed by Soviet actor Sergo Zakariadze, in the 1970 Soviet-Italian film Waterloo. =Various= Bl√ºcher also has a boarding house named after him at Berkshire based Wellington College. The Blucher, as it is known, is a boys' house renowned for sporting and academic prowess. A popular German idiom, geht ran wie Bl√ºcher (\\"charge like Bl√ºcher\\"), means that someone is taking very direct and aggressive action, in war or otherwise, refers to Bl√ºcher. The full German saying, now obsolete, relates to the Battle of the Katzbach in 1813: \\"Der geht ran wie Bl√ºcher an der Katzbach!\\" (\\"He's advancing like Bl√ºcher at Katzbach!\\"), referring to Bl√ºcher and describing vigorous, forceful behavior. en.wikipedia entry on the Battle of the Katzbach, chapter Analysis Vasily Blyukher's last name was given to his family by a landlord in honor of Gebhard.

The administrative centre was the village of Gullstein. The municipality is located in the present-day Aure Municipality. The municipality included the main islands of Tustna, Stabblandet, and Solskjels√∏ya, as well as many smaller, surrounding islets between the Ed√∏yfjorden and the Vinjefjorden. In 2006, when the municipality was merged into Aure, it was . History Tustna was originally a part of the municipality of Ed√∏y (see formannskapsdistrikt). A meeting held on 17 March 1863 decided to build a church on the island of Tustern (which was the name of the island at that time) and thereby gain status as a separate parish within the large municipality. Gullstein Church was built in the village of Gullstein on the eastern side of the island in 1864. A royal resolution of 3 May 1873 directed that the parish of Tustern be separated from Ed√∏y Municipalit to create a separate municipality effective on 1 January 1874. The new municipality had an initial population of 1,179. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the part of Tustna on the island of Ertv√•gs√∏y (population: 85) was transferred to neighboring Aure Municipality to the east. On 1 January 2006, all of Tustna Municipality was merged into Aure Municipality. At its end, Tustna had a population of 1,006. =Coat of arms= The coat of arms for Tustna was blue with a gold klippfisk in the center. This symbolizes the importance of fishing for this type of fish in the municipality. =Name= The municipality was named after the island of Tustna, the main island for the municipality. The name of the island was first mentioned, as Toester, on a Dutch map from 1623. It may be derived from the Old Norse word which means \\"staff\\" or \\"stick\\", and in that case it is probably referring to the form of one of the mountains on the island. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Tustna, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Tustna was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms.

He is a controversial figure in anarchist circles. Life While undertaking a classics major at Columbia University, Wilson met Warren Tartaglia, then introducing Islam to students as the leader of a group called the Noble Moors. Attracted by the philosophy, Wilson was initiated into the group, but later joined a group of breakaway members who founded the Moorish Orthodox Church. The Church maintained a presence at the League for Spiritual Discovery, the group established by Timothy Leary, and it is alleged Wilson would visit it for supplies of LSD. Appalled by the social and political climate, Wilson had also decided to leave America, and shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 he flew to Lebanon. In the words of Michael Muhammad Knight, \\"The emerging postcolonial world was crowded with American hippies blowing their trust funds on mystical quests ... and [Wilson] was one of them.\\"Knight, Michael M. William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an, Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p6 Wilson travelled to India with the intention of studying Sufism, but became fascinated by Tantra, tracking down Ganesh Baba. He spent a month in a Kathmandu missionary hospital being treated for hepatitis, and practised meditation techniques in a cave above the east bank of the Ganges. He also allegedly ingested significant quantities of cannabis.Knight, Michael M. William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an, Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, pp11-78 Wilson travelled on to Pakistan. There he lived in several places, mixing with princes, Sufis, and gutter dwellers, and moving from teahouses to opium dens. In Quetta he found \\"a total disregard of all government\\", with people reliant on family, clans or tribes, which appealed to him. Wilson then moved to Iran. It was here that he developed his scholarship. He translated classical Persian texts with French scholar Henry Corbin, and also worked as a journalist at the Tehran Journal. In 1974, Farah Pahlavi Empress of Iran commissioned her personal secretary, scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr, to establish the Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy. Nasr offered Wilson the position of director of its English language publications, and editorship of its journal Sophia Perennis. This Wilson edited from 1975 until 1978. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Wilson lived in New York, sharing a brownstone townhouse with William Burroughs, with whom he bonded over their shared interests. Burroughs acknowledged Wilson for providing material on Hassan-i Sabbah which he used for his novel The Western Lands. Wilson currently lives in upstate New York. A family trust fund enables him to live in a state he terms \\"independently poor\\". He has been described as \\"a subcultural monument\\".Jarrett, Earnest Living Under Sick Machines: Peter Lamborn WIlson / Hakim Bey, The Brooklyn Rail, 5 June 2014; http://www.brooklynrail.org/2014/06/art/hakim-bey-with-jarrett-earnest Hakim Bey Wilson took an interest in the 'zines' subculture flourishing in Manhattan in the early 1980s, 'zines' being tiny hand-made xeroxed magazines published in small quantities concerning whatever the publishers found compelling. \\"He began writing essays, communiqu√©s as he liked to call them, under the pen name Hakim Bey, which he mailed to friends and publishers of the 'zines' he liked.... His mailouts were immediately popular, and regarded as copyright-free syndicated columns ready for anyone to paste into their xeroxed 'zines'...\\"Rabinowitz, Jacob Blame It On Blake: A Memoir of Dead Languages, Gender Vagrancy, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Corso & Carr (2019),, pages 163-165 Wilson's occasional pen name of Hakim Bey is derived from il-Hakim, the alchemist-king, with 'Bey' a further nod to Moorish Science. Wilson's two personas, as himself and Bey, are facilitated by his publishers who provide separate author biographies even when both appear in the same publication.Knight, Michael M. William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an, Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p74 His Temporary Autonomous Zones work has been referenced in comparison to the \\"free party\\" or teknival scene of the rave subculture. Wilson has been supportive of the rave connection, while remarking in an interview, \\"The ravers were among my biggest readers ... I wish they would rethink all this techno stuff ‚Äî they didn't get that part of my writing.\\" More recently, he has commented on the Occupy Movement in an interview with David Levi Strauss of The Brooklyn Rail: > I was beginning to feel that there would never be another American uprising, > that the energy was gone, and I have some reasons to think that might be > true. I like to point out that the crime rate in America has been declining > for a long time, and in my opinion it's because Americans don't even have > enough gumption to commit crimes anymore: the creative aspect of crime has > fallen into decay. As for the uprising that takes a principled stand against > violence, hats off to them, I admire the idealism, but I don't think it's > going to accomplish much. In another interview with David Levi Strauss and Christopher Bamford in The Brooklyn Rail, Bey has discussed his views on what he calls \\"Green Hermeticism\\": > We all agreed that there is not a sufficient spiritual focus for the > environmental movement. And without a spiritual focus, a movement like this > doesn't generate the kind of emotional energy that it needs to battle > against global capitalism‚Äîthat for which there is no other reality, > according to most people. It should be a rallying call of the spirit for the > environmental movement, or for as many parts of that movement as could be > open to it. Notable theories =Ontological anarchy= In the compilation of essays called \\"Immediatism\\"Immediatism by Hakim Bey. AK Press. 1994. Wilson explains his particular conception of anarchism and anarchy which he calls \\"ontological anarchy\\". In the same compilation he deals with his view of the relationships of individuals with the exterior world as perceived by the senses and a theory of liberation which he calls \\"immediatism\\". =Temporary autonomous zones= Wilson has written articles on three different types of what he calls temporary autonomous zones (TAZ). Regarding his concept of TAZ, he said in an interview the following: > ... the real genesis was my connection to the communal movement in America, > my experiences in the 1960s in places like Timothy Leary's commune in > Millbrook ... Usually only the religious ones last longer than a > generation‚Äîand usually at the expense of becoming quite authoritarian, and > probably dismal and boring as well. I've noticed that the exciting ones tend > to disappear, and as I began to further study this phenomenon, I found that > they tend to disappear in a year or a year and a half.Hans Ulrich Obrist. > \\"In Conversation with Hakim Bey\\" at e-flux In an article on obsessive love, Wilson posited a utopia based on generosity as well as obsession and wrote: > I have dreamed this (I remember it suddenly, as if it were literally a > dream) ‚Äî and it has taken on a tantalizing reality and filtered into my > life‚Äîin certain Temporary Autonomous Zones‚Äîan \\"impossible\\" time and space > ... and on this brief hint, all my theory is based. As such, it may be said that it is part of the eternal vision of an arcadia where desires are fulfilled without reference to the world, and the search for a means of realising it. The concept of TAZ was presented in a long elaboration in the book TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism.Hakim Bey. TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism. Autonomedia. August 1991 Criticism and controversy =Lifestyle anarchism= In Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm, Murray Bookchin included Wilson's work (as Bey) in what he called \\"lifestyle anarchism\\", which he criticized Wilson's writing for tendencies towards mysticism, occultism, and irrationalism.Bookchin, Murray. Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism (1995). AK Press: Stirling. . (pp. 20-26) Wilson did not respond publicly. Bob Black wrote a rejoinder to Bookchin in Anarchy after Leftism. =Pedophilia advocacy= Some writers have been troubled by Bey's endorsement of adults having sex with children. In his book William S. Burroughs vs. the Qur'an, Michael Muhammad Knight describes his experiences with Peter Lamborn Wilson. Knight befriends Wilson, and is invited to stay at his house; he begins writing a biography of Wilson, on which he hopes Wilson might bestow the label \\"official\\". However, as he learns more about Wilson/Bey's writings on pederasty, his view of Wilson sours, and with that their friendship. Knight says \\"writing for NAMBLA amounts to activism in real life. As Hakim Bey, Peter creates a child molester's liberation theology and then publishes it for an audience of potential offenders\\". As Anthony Fiscella summarises the situation, \\"Knight has disavowed his former mentor due to Wilson's advocacy of paedophilia/pederasty\\". However, Joseph Christian Greer criticises Knight's account of his friendship with Wilson, considering it to be unreliable: \\"Half way through the text Knight claims to have become suddenly aware that Wilson promoted and espoused man-boy love as a viable sexuality and immediately lost interest in recording his subject's life ... His description of realizing Wilson's sexuality, though, rings particularly bogus on account of the fact that Wilson is quite open about his sexuality, even to the point of devoting numerous texts to intergenerational relationships. It seems certain that Knight would have been well aware of Wilson's sexuality long before starting to write his biography, and simply used it as an excuse to present his own work as superseding that of his former guru\\". Robert Helms has criticised Wilson for pedophilia, writing that Wilson \\"uses anarchism in an ethically warped, opportunistic way by pretending that adult-child sex is a natural freedom. It isn't, and not only would almost any anarchist disagree with him, but they'd also dispute a child-rapist's right to a non-violent remedy in many cases.\\" Helms accuses Wilson of using the concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones to advocate for pedophilia, citing a previous zine he had created named Wild Children \\"for contributors 17 and under\\", and criticises him as a misogynist for his stance against abortion in \\"Communique #9\\" of TAZ, stating, \\"the ethical idiocy of both [Wilson's pedophilic advocacy and misogyny] are self-evident, and neither is part of anything that should be considered an anarchist idea.\\" Helms has also criticised the broader anarchist community for its silence on the subject, writing: \\"I am left with the impression that they are not taking responsibility for what they know. This does not speak well of the anarchists of the United States. I feel that with anarchism becoming ever more popular, the greater portion of new anarchists are just consumers of anarchist stuff. Since such people can't deal with a new ethical problem, they probably would not know what to do with that new, real revolutionary opportunity for which they pine so passionately.\\" Works *The Winter Calligraphy of Ustad Selim, & Other Poems (1975) (Ipswich, England) *Science and Technology in Islam (1976) (with Leonard Harrow) *Traditional Modes of Contemplation & Action (1977) (editor, with Yusuf Ibish) *Nasir-I Khusraw: 40 Poems from the Divan (1977) (translator and editor, with Gholamreza Aavani) *DIVAN (1978) (poems, London/Tehran) *Kings of Love: The Poetry and History of the Nimatullahi Sufi Order of Iran (1978) (translator and editor, with Nasrollah Pourjavady; Tehran) *Angels (1980, 1994) (abridged edition: ) *Weaver of Tales: Persian Picture Rugs (1980) (with Karl Schlamminger) *Loving Boys: Semiotext(e) Special (1980) (editor as Hakim Bey; Semiotext(e) (New York)) *Divine Flashes (1982) (by Fakhruddin 'Iraqi, translated and introduced with William C.

Early life John MacBride was born at The Quay, Westport, County Mayo, Ireland, to Patrick MacBride, a shopkeeper and trader, and the former Honoria Gill, who survived her son.John MacBride . The National Library of Ireland. Retrieved on 23 September 2007. A plaque marks the building on the Westport Quays where he was born (now the Helm Bar and Restaurant). He was educated at the Christian Brothers' School, Westport, and at St. Malachy's College, Belfast. His red hair and long nose led to him being given the nickname \\"Foxy Jack\\". He worked for a period in a drapery shop in Castlerea, County Roscommon. He had studied medicine, but gave it up and began working with a chemist's firm in Dublin. He joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood and was associated with Michael Cusack in the early days of the Gaelic Athletic Association. He also joined the Celtic Literary Society through which he came to know Arthur Griffith who was to remain a friend and influence throughout his life. Beginning in 1893, MacBride was termed a \\"dangerous nationalist\\" by the British government. In 1896 he went to the United States on behalf of the IRB. In the same year he returned and emigrated to South Africa. Participation in the Second Anglo- Boer War He took part in the Second Boer War, where he raised the Irish Transvaal Brigade. What became known as MacBride's Brigade was first commanded by an Irish American, Colonel John Blake, an ex-US Cavalry Officer. MacBride recommended Blake as Commander since MacBride himself had no military experience.Jordan, Anthony J. Boer War to Easter Rising, Westport Books 2006 p.13 The Brigade was given official recognition by the Boer Government with the commissions of the Brigade's officers signed by State Secretary F.W. Reitz. MacBride was commissioned with the rank of Major in the Boer army and given Boer citizenship. The 500 Irish and Irish-Americans fought the British. Often these Irish commandos were fighting opposite such Irish regiments as the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. From the hills around the besieged town of Ladysmith to the plains of the Orange Free State, MacBride's Brigade first looked after the Boers' great Long Tom gun, then fought in the Battle of Colenso and later held the rearguard, harassing Lord Roberts' cavalry as the Boer army retreated. A Second Irish Brigade was organised by Arthur Lynch. The arrival in the Irish camp of an Irish-American Ambulance Corps bolstered MacBride's Brigade. Michael Davitt who had resigned as an M.P, visited MacBride's Brigade. When Col. Blake was injured at Ladysmith MacBride had to take sole command of the Brigade. Though Blake later returned for a short period he later left the Brigade to join another commando. In Ireland, pro-Boer feeling, informed by Arthur Griffith and Maud Gonne formed the most popular and most fervent of the European pro-Boer movements. However, more than 16,000 Irish fought for the British against the Boers. Marriage to Maud Gonne When MacBride became a citizen of the Transvaal, the British considered that, as an Irishman and citizen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, he had given aid to the enemy. After the war he travelled to Paris where Maud Gonne lived. In 1903, he married her to the disapproval of many, including W. B. Yeats, who considered her his muse and had previously proposed to her. Patrick J. Little, editor of 'New Ireland', who had published both Yeats and Gonne recalled an extreme case that almost prevented the marriage: The following year their son Sean MacBride was born. Yeats wrote to Lady Gregory in January 1905, the month MacBride and Maud separated, that he had been told MacBride had molested his stepdaughter, Iseult, who was 10 at that time.Sinead McCoole, \\"No Ordinary Women\\" (Dublin 2012), biographies The marriage had already failed but the couple could not agree on custody of Sean. Maud instituted divorce proceedings in Paris. No divorce was given but in a separation agreement, Maud won custody to the baby until age 12. The father got visiting rights and one month each summer. MacBride returned to Dublin and never saw his son again.Jordan Anthony J. The Yeats Gonne MacBride Triangle (Westport Books 2000) pp. 49‚Äì104 Anthony J. Jordan argues that MacBride was a much-maligned man in the divorce proceedings. He posits that on the merit of WB Yeats believing Maud Gonne's accusations against her husband, successive biographers of Yeats have treated them as factual, ignoring the verdict of the Parisian Divorce Court which found MacBride innocent. Dr. Caoimhe Nic Dhaibhid writes that \\"The target of Jordan's argument has been a number of biographies of W. B. Yeats, particularly Roy Foster's landmark 1997.\\" She appears to endorse Jordan's position.Irish Historical Studies no 140. November 2010 Caoimhe Nic Dhaibhid \\"The breakdown of the MacBride-Gonne marriage 1904-08\\" No. 144 November 2010 Donal Fallon, MacBride's recent biographer, quotes the poet Paul Durcan, the grandson of Joseph MacBride and Eileen Wilson, as believing that MacBride \\"was unquestionably defamed\\" and lays much of the blame on the \\"people in the Yeats-Maud Gonne Industry\\". About forty years after the marriage had ended, Maud herself attributed the breakdown of the marriage to John's loneliness and a drink problem in Paris, during her frequent trips to Ireland without him. 1916 Easter Rising After returning permanently from Paris to Dublin in 1905 MacBride joined other Irish nationalists in preparing for an insurrection. Because he was so well known to the British, the leaders thought it wise to keep him outside their secret military group planning a Rising. As a result he happened to find himself in the midst of the Rising without notice. He was in Dublin early on Easter Monday morning to meet his brother Dr. Anthony MacBride, who was arriving from Westport to be married on the Wednesday. The Major walked up Grafton St and saw Thomas MacDonagh in uniform and leading his troops. He offered his services and was appointed second-in- command at the Jacob's factory. After the Rising, MacBride, following a court martial under the Defence of the Realm Act, was shot by British troops in Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin. Kilmainham Gaol He was executed on 5 May 1916. Facing the British firing squad, he said he did not wish to be blindfolded, adding \\"I have looked down the muzzles of too many guns in the South African war to fear death and now please carry out your sentence.\\" He is buried in the cemetery at Arbour Hill Prison in Dublin. Yeats, who was jealous of MacBride for marrying Maud Gonne (and later proposed to her daughter Iseult) gave MacBride an ambivalent eulogy in his poem \\"Easter, 1916\\": Maud Gonne wrote to Yeats, \\"No I dont like your poem, it isn't worthy of you & above all it isn't worthy of its subject... As for my husband he has entered eternity by the great door of sacrifice‚Ä¶ so that praying for him I can also ask for his prayers\\". Legacy Statue of John MacBride (1868-1916) in his native Westport, County Mayo, at South Mall In November 2016 Ciar√°n MacSuibhne, a member of the local St Patrick‚Äôs Drama Group wrote an amateur, three-act play detailing various stages in MacBride's life including his experiences in the Second Boer War, his marriage to and separation from Maud Gonne and the concern regarding the future of their only child, Se√°n, which followed. The play, which featured the poetry of Yeats, also covers the period following MacBride's execution. The opening and closing scenes of the play, in particular were described as \\"very moving\\". The character of Maud Gonne's half-sister, Eileen Wilson was played by Wilson's great-granddaughter, Bernardine Walsh MacBride. The play, which was shown in the Westport Town Hall Theatre, was described by the Mayo News as \\"a fitting tribute by a local drama group to a local hero\\".

He died in the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger, on which he was serving as Mission Specialist for mission STS-51-L. He was the first Asian American and the first person of Japanese ancestry to reach space. Early life Born June 24, 1946, Onizuka was the oldest son and second-youngest child of Masamitsu and Mitsue Onizuka. He was a Buddhist. He had two older sisters, Shirley and Norma, and a younger brother, Claude, who became the family spokesman after the Challenger disaster. Growing up, Ellison was an active participant in FFA, 4-H, and the Boy Scouts of America, where he reached the level of Eagle Scout. Onizuka graduated from Konawaena High School in 1964. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering in June 1969, and a Master of Science degree in that field in December of the same year, from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He participated in U.S. Air Force ROTC during his time there and is an alumnus of Triangle Fraternity. Onizuka married Lorna Leiko Yoshida on June 7, 1969, while completing his studies at the University of Colorado. They had two daughters, Janelle Onizuka-Gillilan (b. 1969) and Darien Lei Shizue Onizuka-Morgan (b. 1975). Air Force career On January 15, 1970, Onizuka entered active duty with the United States Air Force, where he served as a flight test engineer and test pilot at Sacramento Air Logistics Center at McClellan Air Force Base. He worked in test flight programs and systems security engineering for the F-84, F-100, F-105, F-111, EC-121T, T-33, T-39, T-28, and A-1. From August 1974 to July 1975, Onizuka attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. In July 1975, he was assigned to the Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He became a squadron flight test engineer at the USAF Test Pilot School, and later worked as a manager for engineering support in the training resources division. His duties there consisted of course instruction and management of the airship fleet (A-7, A-37, T-38, F-4, T-33, and NKC-135) being used for the Test Pilot School and Flight Test Center. While at the school, he registered more than 1,700 flight hours. NASA career Onizuka was selected for the astronaut program in January 1978 and completed one year of evaluation and training in August 1979. Later, he worked in the experimentation team, Orbiter test team, and launch support crew at Kennedy Space Center for the STS-1 and STS-2. At NASA, he worked on the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) test and revision software team. Onizuka's first space mission took place on January 24, 1985, with the launch of mission STS 51-C on Space Shuttle Discovery, the first space shuttle mission for the Department of Defense. He was accompanied by Commander Ken Mattingly, Pilot Loren Shriver, fellow Mission Specialist James Buchli, and Payload Specialist Gary E. Payton. During the mission, he was responsible for the activities of the primary payloads, which included the unfolding of the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) surface. After 48 orbits around the Earth, Discovery landed at Kennedy Space Center on January 27, 1985. He had completed a total of 74 hours in space. Gravesite of Onizuka Onizuka was assigned to the mission STS 51-L on the Space Shuttle Challenger that took off from Kennedy Space Center at 11:38:00 EST (16:38:00 UTC) on January 28, 1986. The other Challenger crew members were commander Dick Scobee, pilot Michael J. Smith, mission specialists Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik, and payload specialists Gregory Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe. It was destroyed when a flame jet leaking from a solid rocket booster ruptured the liquid hydrogen fuel tank 73 seconds after launch. All seven crew members were killed. Following the Challenger disaster, examination of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed that three of the crew members' Personal Egress Air Packs were activated: those of Onizuka, mission specialist Judith Resnik, and pilot Michael Smith. The location of Smith's activation switch, on the back side of his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent. Onizuka was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii. At the time of his death, he held the rank of lieutenant colonel. Posthumously, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. An Act To Authorize the President to Promote Posthumously the Late Lieutenant Colonel Ellison S. Onizuka to the Grade of Colonel. Memberships and distinctions Onizuka belonged to the following organizations: Society of Flight Test Engineers, the Air Force Association, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Tau, Arnold Air Society, and Triangle Fraternity. Among his distinctions are the Air Force Commendation Medal, Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, and National Defense Service Medal. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. Legacy Downtown Los Angeles as seen from the corner of Ellison S. Onizuka St., San Pedro St. and 2nd St. in Little Tokyo Onizuka Air Force Station in Sunnyvale, California and Onizuka Village family housing on Hickam Air Force Base are dedicated to him. The Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center at Kona International Airport in the Kona district of Hawaii island where he was born and raised, was dedicated to him. The center closed in March 2016 and was unable to find a suitable location to reopen. Select items from the center's collection have been put on permanent display at the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii in Moiliili on the island of Oahu. They not only feature Onizuka's personal items, but also the only moon rock in Hawaii and the space suit from Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise. Two astronomical features were also named after him: an asteroid discovered by Edward L. G. Bowell on February 8, 1984, 3355 Onizuka and a 29-km-diameter crater on the Moon, Onizuka. Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, California also has a street named after him, as does the street surrounding Whitcomb Elementary school in Clear Lake City, Houston, Texas, where his daughters attended. It also named its library the Onizuka Memorial Library. (At the time of the Challenger disaster, his older daughter, Janelle, attended Clear Lake High School. His younger daughter, Darien Lei, was at Whitcomb.) In addition, Onizuka Street in Little Tokyo has a scale replica of the Challenger as a memorial, and a permanent memorial to Onizuka is located in the lobby of the Hompa Hongwanji Buddhist Temple.

It is a member of the family Sapindaceae.  Description  Acer platanoides is a deciduous tree, growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter, and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey-brown and shallowly grooved. Unlike many other maples, mature trees do not tend to develop a shaggy bark. The shoots are green at first, soon becoming pale brown. The winter buds are shiny red-brown. The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed with five lobes, long and (rarely ) across; the lobes each bear one to three side teeth, and an otherwise smooth margin. The leaf petiole is long, and secretes a milky juice when broken. The autumn colour is usually yellow, occasionally orange-red. Flower, close-up The flowers are in corymbs of 15‚Äì30 together, yellow to yellow-green with five sepals and five petals long; flowering occurs in early spring before the new leaves emerge. The fruit is a double samara x20px with two winged seeds. the seeds are disc-shaped, strongly flattened, across and thick. The wings are long, widely spread, approaching a 180¬∞ angle. It typically produces a large quantity of viable seeds. Under ideal conditions in its native range, Norway maple may live up to 250 years, but often has a much shorter life expectancy; in North America, for example, sometimes only 60 years. Especially when used on streets, it can have insufficient space for its root network and is prone to the roots wrapping around themselves, girdling and killing the tree. In addition, their roots tend to be quite shallow and thereby they easily out-compete nearby plants for nutrient uptake. Norway maples often cause significant damage and cleanup costs for municipalities and homeowners when branches break off in storms as it does not have strong wood.  Classification and identification  Tree in flower Norway maple bark The Norway maple is a member (and is the type species) of the section Platanoidea Pax, characterised by flattened, disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap. Other related species in this section include Acer campestre (field maple), Acer cappadocicum (Cappadocian maple), Acer lobelii (Lobel's maple), and Acer truncatum (Shandong maple). From the field maple, the Norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed, not blunt, lobes, and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes. It is also frequently confused with the more distantly related Acer saccharum (sugar maple). The sugar maple is easy to differentiate by clear sap in the petiole (leaf stem); Norway maple petioles have white sap. The tips of the points on Norway maple leaves reduce to a fine \\"hair\\", while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are, on close inspection, rounded. On mature trees, sugar maple bark is more shaggy, while Norway maple bark has small, often criss-crossing grooves. While the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species, the leaf lobes of Norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples. Flowering and seed production begins at ten years of age, however large quantities of seeds are not produced until the tree is 20. As with most maples, Norway maple is normally dioecious (separate male and female trees), occasionally monoecious, and trees may change gender from year to year. The fruits of Norway maple are paired samaras with widely diverging wings, distinguishing them from those of sycamore, Acer pseudoplatanus which are at 90 degrees to each other. Norway maple seeds are flattened, while those of sugar maple are globose. The sugar maple usually has a brighter orange autumn color, where the Norway maple is usually yellow, although some of the red-leaved cultivars appear more orange. The flowers emerge in spring before the leaves and last 2-3 weeks. Leafout of Norway Maple is tied to photoperiod and initiated when day lengths reach approximately 13 hours, which is generally in April. Leaf drop in autumn is initiated when day lengths fall to approximately 10 hours. Depending on the latitude, leaf drop may vary by as much as three weeks, beginning in the second week of October in Scandinavia and the first week of November in southern Europe. Unlike some other maples that wait for the soil to warm up, A. platanoides seeds require only three months of exposure to temperatures lower than and will sprout in early spring, around the same time that leafout begins. Norway maple does not require freezing temperatures for proper growth, however it is adapted to higher latitudes with long summer days and does not perform well when planted south of the 37th parallel, the approximate southern limit of its range in Europe. The heavy seed crop and high germination rate contributes to its invasiveness in North America, where it forms dense monotypic stands that choke out native vegetation. Since Norway Maple's leafout in spring is also tied to photoperiod unlike most North American trees which leaf out based on air temperature, the tree has a competitive advantage in that it may leaf out well before native trees and shrubs since the latter may be delayed by the weather conditions. It is one of the few introduced species that can successfully invade and colonize a virgin forest. By comparison, in its native range, Norway maple is rarely a dominant species and instead occurs mostly as a scattered understory tree.  Cultivation and uses  Foliage and fruit; the fruit are an important characteristic for identification of this species The wood is hard, yellowish-white to pale reddish, with the heartwood not distinct; it is used for furniture and turnery. Norway maple sits ambiguously between hard and soft maple with a Janka hardness of . The wood is rated as non-durable to perishable in regard to decay resistance. In Europe, it is used for furniture, flooring and musical instruments. This species as grown in the former Yugoslavia is also called Bosnian Maple, and is probably the Maple used by the famous Italian violin makers, Stradivari and Guarneri. Norway maple has been widely taken into cultivation in other areas, including western Europe northwest of its native range. It grows north of the Arctic Circle at Troms√∏, Norway. In North America, it is planted as a street and shade tree as far north as Anchorage, Alaska. It is most recommended in USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 7 but will grow in warmer zones (at least up to Zone 10) where summer heat is moderate, as along the Pacific coast south to the Los Angeles basin.History and Range of Norway Maple During the 1950s‚Äì60s it became popular as a street tree due to the large-scale loss of American elms from Dutch elm disease. It is favored due to its tall trunk and tolerance of poor, compacted soils and urban pollution, conditions in which sugar maple has difficulty. It has become a popular species for bonsai in Europe and is used for medium to large bonsai sizes and a multitude of styles. Norway maples are not typically cultivated for maple syrup production due to the lower sugar content of the sap compared to sugar maple.  Cultivars  Many cultivars have been selected for distinctive leaf shapes or colorations, such as the dark purple of 'Crimson King' and 'Schwedleri', the variegated leaves of 'Drummondii', the light green of 'Emerald Queen', and the deeply divided, feathery leaves of 'Dissectum' and 'Lorbergii'. The purple-foliage cultivars have orange to red autumn colour. 'Columnare' is selected for its narrow upright growth. The cultivars 'Crimson King' and ='Prigold' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  As an invasive species in North America  The Norway maple was introduced to northeastern North America between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree. It was brought to the Pacific Northwest in the 1870s. The roots of Norway maples grow very close to the ground surface, starving other plants of moisture. For example, lawn grass (and even weeds) will usually not grow well beneath a Norway maple, but English Ivy, with its minimal rooting needs, may thrive. In addition, the dense canopy of Norway maples can inhibit understory growth. Some have suggested Norway maples may also release chemicals to discourage undergrowth, although this claim is controversial. A. platanoides has been shown to inhibit the growth of native saplings as a canopy tree or as a sapling. The Norway maple also suffers less herbivory than the sugar maple, allowing it to gain a competitive advantage against the latter species. As a result of these characteristics, it is considered invasive in some states, and has been banned for sale in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The State of New York has classified it as an invasive plant species. Despite these steps, the species is still available and widely used for urban plantings in many areas.

He carried out extensive studies of the Milky Way and was the discoverer of evidence for galactic rotation. Kapteyn was also among the first to suggest the existence of dark matter using stellar velocities as early as 1922.Kapteyn, Jacobus Cornelius (1922). \\"First attempt at a theory of the arrangement and motion of the sidereal system\\". Astrophysical Journal. 55: 302‚Äì327. Bibcode:1922ApJ....55..302K. doi:10.1086/142670. It is incidentally suggested that when the theory is perfected it may be possible to determine the amount of dark matter from its gravitational effect. (emphasis in original)  Kapteyn's family and early life  Kapteyn was born in Barneveld in the Netherlands to Gerrit J. and Elisabeth C. (n√©e Koomans) Kapteyn, and was one of 15 children. Many of the Kapteyns were gifted in mathematics and physics. He passed his entrance exams for university at the age of 16 but Kapteyn's parents wouldn't allow him to go until the following year. He went to the University of Utrecht to study mathematics and physics in 1868. He did very well in his studies and when he graduated he was magna cum laude. This laid the foundation for his later career. Jacobus Kapteyn was a very doting father during the earlier years in his career and took an interactive role which during the 1880s was not done much by fathers. When Kapteyn's children reached schooling age both his daughters, Jacoba Cornelia and Henrietta, and his son, Gerrit, went to a boys' school. His daughters later made significant strides for women by going to university to read law and medicine. His daughter Henrietta (1881‚Äì1956) married astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung and gave him a granddaughter named Rigel.  Career  In 1875, after having finished his thesis, he worked for three years at the Leiden Observatory. In 1878 Kapteyn was inducted as the first professor of astronomy and theoretical mechanics at the University of Groningen. Also at Groningen, he founded the Astronomical Laboratory in 1896 and consequently became the director of the facility. Kapteyn fulfilled both occupational roles as professor and director at Groningen until his retirement in 1921. In 1888 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Between 1896 and 1900, lacking an observatory, he volunteered to measure photographic plates taken by David Gill, who was conducting a photographic survey of southern hemisphere stars at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope. To measure these plates he used a special parallacticic instrument that Kapteyn himself had constructed. The results of this collaboration was the publication of Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, a catalog listing positions and magnitudes for 454,875 stars in the Southern Hemisphere. In 1897, as part of the above work, he discovered Kapteyn's Star. It had the highest proper motion of any star known until the discovery of Barnard's Star in 1916. In 1904, studying the proper motions of stars, Kapteyn reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; stars could be divided into two streams, moving in nearly opposite directions. It was later realized that Kapteyn's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our Galaxy, which ultimately led to the finding of galactic rotation by Bertil Lindblad and Jan Oort. In 1906, Kapteyn launched a plan for a major study of the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, using counts of stars in different directions. The plan involved measuring the apparent magnitude, spectral type, radial velocity, and proper motion of stars in 206 zones. This enormous project was the first coordinated statistical analysis in astronomy and involved the cooperation of over forty different observatories. Around 1913 Kapteyn developed a theory of how stars were made based on his observations of irregular nebulae and their velocities. He theorized that stars in irregular nebulae eventually evolved into planetary nebulae. Although this theory is not entirely correct it did have some redeeming qualities. He was awarded the James Craig Watson Medal in 1913. The year of 1920 Kapteyn took a part-time job at University of Leiden after leaving the university of Groningen. This move made Kapteyn able to see his granddaughter Rigel and his daughter Henrietta. In Kapteyn's later years of work he spent his time working on the combination of his life's work revising and editing the Kapteyn Universe. Kapteyn later retired in 1921 at the age of seventy, but on the request of his former student and director of Leiden Observatory Willem de Sitter, Kapteyn went back to Leiden to assist in upgrading the observatory to contemporary astronomical standards. The astronomy institute of the University of Groningen is named after Kapteyn. A street in the city of Groningen is also named after Kapteyn: the J.C. Kapteynlaan. And the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes on La Palma in the Canary Islands named the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope (JKT) after him.  The Kapteyn Universe  The structure and size of the galaxy was of great interest to many astronomers during Kapteyn's time. Around 1900, Hugo von Seegler made an attempt at the structure of the galaxy by making counts of stars between successive magnitudes. Ultimately, von Seegler was able to determine the rates at which the galaxy was diminishing in multiple different areas of the sky. In 1901, Kapteyn employed the proper motions technique and derived a statistical approach that allowed him to estimate the average distance to stars between successive magnitudes, effectively providing a scale for von Seegler's discoveries. Conclusive results from von Seegler and Kapteyn estimated the galaxy to be an oblate star system approximately 10 kpc in width and 2 kpc in thickness, the sun being relatively close (0.6 kpc) to the center. Using the method of star counts, Kapteyn was able to confirm his results and dubbed his findings as his first model of the galaxy. Despite having made great strides and providing a model for the galaxy, there was one major issue. Kapteyn's work was based on an unproven presumption, that is, there is no light absorption in space. If there were light absorption in space, then stars would look more faint, thus, seeming further away than they actually are. Light absorption would also cause the galaxy to disperse more quickly than it actually does. If light absorption proved to be a considerable factor, then Kapteyn's work, or at least his conclusions, would more or less be obsolete. To circumvent this dilemma, Kapteyn spent years studying and measuring the amount of absorption. In 1917 Kapteyn's assumptions on interstellar absorption were debated. The arguments were centered around an issue with the \\"zone of avoidance\\". By 1918, he was convinced light absorption was of negligible amounts and confidently stood behind his first model for the structure of the galaxy. Kapteyn had presented his findings in his life's work, First Attempt at a Theory of the Arrangement and Motion of the Sidereal System, which was published in 1922. It was determined that his model of the galaxy was valid at high galactic latitudes but failed in the galactic plane because of the lack of knowledge on interstellar absorption. Kapteyn was not well enough to meet with his peers and discuss his work. He died in June 1922, soon after its publishing. It was only after Kapteyn's death, in Amsterdam, that Robert Trumpler determined that the amount of interstellar reddening was actually much greater than had been assumed. This discovery estimated the size of the galaxy to be about 2.5 times larger than initially was thought, with the sun replaced to a distance of 9.2 kpc from the galactic center.

An ethical code generally implies documents at three levels: codes of business ethics, codes of conduct for employees, and codes of professional practice. Code of ethics or code of conduct? (Corporate or business ethics) Many companies use the phrases ethical code and code of conduct interchangeably but it may be useful to make a distinction. A code of ethics will start by setting out the values that underpin the code and will describe a company's obligation to its stakeholders. The code is publicly available and addressed to anyone with an interest in the company's activities and the way it does business. It will include details of how the company plans to implement its values and vision, as well as guidance to staff on ethical standards and how to achieve them. However, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and intended for employees alone. It usually sets out restrictions on behavior, and will be far more compliance or rules focused than value or principle focused. Code of practice (professional ethics) A code of practice is adopted by a profession or by a governmental or non- governmental organization to regulate that profession. A code of practice may be styled as a code of professional responsibility, which will discuss difficult issues, difficult decisions that will often need to be made, and provide a clear account of what behavior is considered \\"ethical\\" or \\"correct\\" or \\"right\\" in the circumstances. In a membership context, failure to comply with a code of practice can result in expulsion from the professional organization. In its 2007 International Good Practice Guidance, Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations, the International Federation of Accountants provided the following working definition: \\"Principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that (a) contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and (b) respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations.\\" Listed below are a few example statements from the professional codes of the Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation (Fourth Estate), Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), and the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ): ; Fourth Estate's Journalism Code of Practice : \\"Accuracy: Accuracy, more-so than exclusivity or timeliness, is the overriding value of journalism.\\" : \\"Independence: Independence from state control, business interests, market forces, or any other vested interest or outside pressure is a hallmark of dispassionate, critical, and reliable journalism. It bolsters legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of the public.\\" : \\"Impartiality: Impartiality means not being prejudiced towards or against any particular ideology, idea, or preconception. Impartiality requires fairness and balance that follows the weight of evidence: it allows the journalist to make sense of events through dispassionate analysis of all relevant facts and perspectives.\\" : \\"Integrity: Integrity in journalism ensures that people and organizations uphold the values of journalism, always strive to do the right thing in all situations, even to their personal or organizational detriment, and put their obligations to the public first.\\" : \\"Harm Minimization: Journalists must always remember that they are dealing with human lives. The potential for public good must sufficiently outweigh the potential for harm that may come from the activity of journalism.\\" : \\"Engagement: Engagement with the public ensures that journalism remains open, accessible, collaborative, and participatory while keeping the journalist accountable to the highest standards of accuracy, independence, impartiality, and integrity.\\" : \\"Accountability: Accountability is essential to the ethical practice of journalism and the maintenance of the public trust. Being accountable for news-gathering practices and reporting means making firm commitments and taking responsibility for your journalism and the journalism of your peers.\\" ; PRSA Code of Ethics : ‚ÄúLoyalty: We are faithful to those we represent, while honoring our obligation to serve the public interest.‚Äù : ‚ÄúFairness: We deal fairly with clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, the media, and the general public. We respect all opinions and support the right of free expression.‚Äù ; SPJ Code of Ethics : ‚ÄúMinimize Harm ‚Ä¶ Balance the public‚Äôs need for information against potential harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance or undue intrusiveness. ‚Ä¶ Balance a suspect‚Äôs right to a fair trial with the public‚Äôs right to know. Consider the implications of identifying criminal suspects before they face legal charges. ‚Ä¶‚Äù : ‚ÄúAct Independently ‚Ä¶ Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose unavoidable conflicts.‚Äù General notes Ethical codes are often adopted by management, not to promote a particular moral theory, but rather because they are seen as pragmatic necessities for running an organization in a complex society in which moral concepts play an important part. They are distinct from moral codes that may apply to the culture, education, and religion of a whole society. It is debated whether the politicians should apply a code of ethics, or whether it is a profession entirely discretionary, just subject to compliance with the law: however, recently codes of practice have been approved in this field. Often, acts that violate ethical codes may also violate a law or regulation and can be punishable at law or by government agency remedies. Even organizations and communities that may be considered criminal in nature may have ethical codes of conduct, official or unofficial. Examples could include hacker communities, bands of thieves, and street gangs. Codes seek to define and delineate the difference between conduct and behavior that is malum in se, malum prohibitum, and good practice. Sometimes ethical codes include sections that are meant to give firm rules, but some offer general guidance, and sometimes the words are merely aspirational. In sum, a code of ethics is an attempt to codify \\"good and bad behavior\\".

It is part of the traditional district of S√∏rlandet. The administrative center of the municipality is the town of Lillesand. Some of the larger villages in Lillesand municipality include √Öker√∏yhamn, Brekkest√∏, Gamle Hellesund, Helldal, H√∏v√•g, Ribe, Skottevik, Tr√∏e, Ulv√∏ysund, and Vesterhus. The municipality is the 335th largest by area out of the 422 municipalities in Norway. Lillesand is the 109th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 10,702. The municipality's population density is and its population has increased by 17.5% over the last decade. General information Just√∏y Bridge over Blindleia in Lillesand. Lillesand Church in the centre of the town The town of Lillesand was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the following areas were merged into a new, larger municipality of Lillesand: *the town of Lillesand (population: 1,041) *the rural municipality of H√∏v√•g (population: 1,330) *the rural municipality of Vestre Moland (population: 2,454) *the Gitmarkg√•rdene area of Eide municipality (population: 22) =Name= The Old Norse form of the name was just Sandr which means \\"sand beach\\". The first element lille which means \\"little\\" was added after the founding of Kristiansand in 1641 to distinguish it from the greater and more important town nearby. =Coat-of-arms= The coat-of-arms is from modern times; they were granted on 11 September 1987. The arms show three silver anchors on a blue background. The anchor was chosen to symbolize the connection that the municipality has with the sea and there are three of them to symbolize the three smaller municipalities that were merged in 1964 to form the present municipality. History Sanden, which consisted of the small area near the harbor, was the original name for the municipality of Lillesand. Lillesand is built on the ancient estate of Lofthus. Christian Jensen Lofthuus was captured on his Lofthus estate around 1780. In 1821, when Lillesand became a privileged port, it had a population of only 300 and had nine shipyards. By 1895 the merchant fleet was 95 vessels strong. But the death of the sailing ship caused severe economic difficulties for Lillesand. Sailing ships had been inexpensive and could be built from local timber. Steamers were built of steel, were expensive and required more capital than locals could muster. Shipyards were closed. Many of the residents emigrated from there to the United States. Lillesand remained a fishing village, though even this area suffered when the herring left the coast. The Saltholmen Lighthouse, located on an island off Lillesand, is a nineteenth century lighthouse with a slate roof and a concrete tower for the light. It operated as a manned lighthouse from 1882 to 1952. Saltholmen (lit. \\"Salty Islet\\") is named after the salt extraction industry once there, established by Hans Nielsen Hauge. The Lillesand-Flaksvandbanen operated between Lillesand and Flaksvann from 1896 to 1953. The Orze≈Ç, a Polish submarine sank the German troop transport Rio de Janeiro on 8 April 1940 off Lillesand. The Rio de Janeiro was on its way to take part in the initial landings of Operation Weser√ºbung the next day, the invasion of Norway. Geography Lillesand is bordered in the north by Birkenes municipality, to the east by Grimstad municipality and to the south by Kristiansand municipality. The lake √òstre Grimevann is a large lake in the northern part of the municipality and the river Tovdalselva runs through the municipality, too. The Blindleia is an inland waterway that starts in Gamle Hellesund in H√∏v√•g near Kristiansand in southern Norway, and continues past Lillesand. It is a salt water passage protected from the open sea by the offshore archipelago. The island of Just√∏y lies just south of the town of Lillesand, along the Blindleia. The Kv√•sefjorden lies along the southwestern border of Lillesand municipality. Navigation through the Blindleia passage requires attention to detail, but is not difficult as there are no tides, and very little current. The minimal tidal change in the skerries is due to its geographical location; the tidal flow that comes in from the Atlantic Ocean splits on the British Isles. One tidal stream goes through the English Channel, while the other goes around the north of the British Isles. The stream of the English Channel reaches the coast of Norway before the wave traveling around the British Islands. These two tidal \\"waves\\" are completely out of phase when they meet here, neutralizing the tidal effect. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Lillesand, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elect a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council (Kommunestyre) of Lillesand is made up of 27 representatives that are elected to four year terms. Currently, the party breakdown is as follows: Attractions √òvre gate with white wooden houses in the town center of Lillesand The Norwegian National Park Skj√¶rg√•rdsparken lies between Ris√∏r and Lillesand. Skj√¶rg√•rdsparken, \\"the Park of Archipelago\\" is a paradise of islands, skerries, and rocks. Blindleia is a 12 kilometers Inland waterway between Lillesand and Ulv√∏ysund with much small boat traffic in the summertime. The village of Brekkest√∏ is tourist area on the island of Just√∏ya. Lillesand Town- and Maritime Museum is a local, culture historic museum, located in the centre of the town. The museum is also called Carl Knudsen- g√•rden. The Norwegian author Jostein Gaarder refers to this town in several of his books, for example in Sophie's World, where The Solitaire Mystery refers to Lillesand. =Churches= Lillesand Church is a wooden church which was built in 1887‚Äì1889 in Gothic Revival/Swiss style. The architect was Henrik Thrap-Meyer who also designed the pulpit, altarpiece and baptismal font. The altarpiece was done by Abraham T√∏nnessen. Lillesand Church is perched high above the city on a hill at Kirkeheia. In the current Lillesand municipality are also the medieval stone churches Vestre Moland Church and H√∏v√•g Church, both of which are listed cultural heritage sites.
