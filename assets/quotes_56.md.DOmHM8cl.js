It is a common Islamic Arabic expression, used in various contexts by Muslims; in formal Salah (prayer), in the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer), as an informal expression of faith, in times of distress or joy, or to express resolute determination or defiance. Exegesis The Arabic word () means great from the Semitic root '. The Arabic word () is the elative form (greatest) of the adjective kabƒ´r. When used in the it is usually translated as greatest, but some authors translate it as greater.E. W. Lane, Arabic English Lexicon, 1893, gives for kabir: \\"greater, and greatest, in body, or corporeal substance, and in estimation or rank or dignity, and more, or most, advanced in age, older, and oldest\\" (p. 2587) .\\"The formula, as the briefest expression of the absolute superiority of the One God, is used in Muslim life in different circumstances, in which the idea of God, His greatness and goodness is suggested.\\" Wensinck, A. J. The Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edition. Brill, 2000. Volume 10, T-U, p. 119, Takbir. The term ' itself is the stem II verbal noun of the triliteral root ', meaning \\"great\\", from which akbar \\"greater\\" is derived. The form ' is the nominative of Allah, meaning 'God'.B√∂wering, Gerhard, God and His Attributes, Encyclopaedia of the Qur ºƒÅn, Brill, 2007.Macdonald, D. B. The Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edition. Brill, 1971. Volume 3, H-Iram, p. 1093, Ilah. Usage in Islamic rituals nasta ølƒ´q left This phrase is recited by Muslims in many different situations. For example, when they are very happy, to express approval, to prevent a Muslim from becoming prideful by reminding them that Allah is their source of success, as a battle cry, or during times of extreme stress. The phrase is not found in the Quran, which does not refer to God as akbar, but uses the name al-Kabƒ´r \\"The Great\\" or Kabƒ´r \\"Great\\", commonly translated as \\"Most Great\\" (13:9, 31:30, 22:62, 34:23, 40:12, 4:34). =In prayer= The phrase is said during each stage of both salah (obligatory prayers, performed five times a day), and nafl (supererogatory prayers, performed at will). The Muslim call to prayer (adhan) by the muezzin and to commence prayer (iqama) also contains the phrase. While there are many short prayers like it, the usage of takbir is more frequent than any other short prayer. = Following births and deaths = The phrase is used after the birth of a child as a means of praising God. It is also part Islamic funeral and burial customs. = During the Eid Festival and the Hajj = During the festival of Eid al-Adha and the days preceding it, Muslims recite the Takbƒ´r. This is particularly the case on the Day of Arafah. =During the halal slaughter of animals= The process of pronouncing the name of Allah while performing Dhabihah one must say \\"Bismillah Allahu Akbar\\". Other social usage AllƒÅhu akbar in a memorial, Desouk, Egypt \\"AllƒÅhu akbar\\" in Arabic calligraphy seen on Imam Ali Mosque architecture (center of the Iwan), 1994 The expression \\"Allah Akbar\\" can be used in a variety of situations, from celebrations to times of grief. In a historical account by someone who was present both at the birth of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and at his funeral, the author observes that \\"Allahu Akbar\\" was said on both occasions. =In times of distress= The phrase is sometimes used during distress. Just before Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 crashed into the jungle near Medan, Indonesia, the pilot screamed \\"Aaaaaaah! AllƒÅhu akbar\\" into his radio. According to a radio communication transcript, the pilot's conversation with the air controller had been in English, but his last words were the takbir as the plane crashed on September 26, 1997, killing all 234 people aboard in Indonesia's deadliest crash. It was suspected that the crash may have been due to either disorientation or turbine engine failure caused by local dense smog resulting from forest fires. = In times of joy and gratitude = Takbir can be used to express joy or surprise. It is also used as applause in religious contexts, such as after a Quran recital, as other forms of applause are considered less appropriate. When Reshma Begum was discovered alive 17 days after the 2013 Savar building collapse in Bangladesh which killed 1129 people, crowds jubilantly cried \\"AllƒÅhu akbar\\" to express their joy and gratitude that she had survived. As a multi-purpose phrase, it is sometimes used by Arab football commentators as an expression of amazement, or even as a football chant. = In battles = It has been used historically as a battle cry during war.Ludwig W. Adamec, Historical Dictionary of Islam, Scarecrow Press, 2nd ed. 2009, pg. 32 Ibn Ishaq's Life of Mohammed narrates at least two incidents in which the phrase was used. \\"When the apostle raided a people he waited until the morning. If he heard a call to prayer' he held back; if he did not hear it he attacked. We came to Khaybar by night, and the apostle passed the night there; and when morning came he did not hear the call to prayer,' so he rode and we rode with him, and I rode behind Abii Talba with my foot touching the apostle's foot. We met the workers of Khaybar coming out in the morning with their spades and baskets. When they saw the apostle and the army they cried, \`Muhammad with his force,' and turned tail and fled. The apostle said, 'Allah akbar! Khaybar is destroyed. When we arrive in a people's square it is a bad morning for those who have been warned.'\\" (page 511) \\"So he got off his horse and came at him and 'Ali advanced with his shield. \`Amr aimed a blow which cut deeply into the shield so that the sword stuck in it and struck his head. But 'Ali gave him a blow on the vein at the base of the neck and he fell to the ground. The dust rose and the apostle heard the cry, 'Allah Akbar' and knew that 'Ali had killed him.\\" (page 456) Life of Mohammed [ÿ≥Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá] by Ibn Ishaq, translated by Alfred Guillaume, Oxford University Press, 1955, 17th printing, Karachi, 2004 https://archive.org/details/TheLifeOfMohammedGuillaume =Protest= During the Iranian Revolution of 1979, it was shouted from rooftops in Iran during the evenings as a form of protest. This practice returned in the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests,Yahoo News which protested the election results. = Usage by extremists = The phrase has sometimes been used as a battle cry by Muslim extremists. This usage has been denounced by other Muslims. Professor Khaled A. Beydoun writes that the association of the phrase \\"Allah Akbar\\" with terrorism has been exacerbated by mass media and television pundits. He points out that fictional films and shows also utilize it as a cinematic trope further cementing the association. On flags The phrase AllƒÅhu akbar is written on the center of the flag of Iraq, 22 times along the borders of the central white stripe on the flag of Iran, and beneath the Shahada in the flag of Afghanistan in white script on the central red background as determined by the 2004 draft constitution. =Iraq= During the Gulf War in January 1991, Saddam Hussein held a meeting with top military commanders, where it was decided to add the words AllƒÅhu akbar (described as the Islamic battle cry) to Iraq's flag to boost his secular regime's religious credentials, casting himself as the leader of an Islamic army. Hussein described the flag as \\"the banner of jihad and monotheism\\". In 2004, the US-picked Iraqi Governing Council approved a new flag for Iraq that abandoned symbols of Hussein's regime, such as the words AllƒÅhu akbar. In January 2008, however, Iraq's parliament passed a law to change the flag by leaving in the phrase, but changing the calligraphy of the words AllƒÅhu akbar, which had been a copy of Hussein's handwriting, to a Kufic script.Abdul-Zahra, Qassim, \\"Iraqi Lawmakers Vote to Change Flag,\\" USA Today, January 22, 2008, accessed February 9, 2010 The Iraqi flag under Hussein had each of the two words of the phrase written in one of the spaces between the stars on the central band; the 2008 flag, while leaving the phrase in, removes the stars. =Iran= The phrase AllƒÅhu akbar is written on the flag of Iran, as called for by Article 18 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The phrase appears 22 times on the flag.Jacoby, Jeff, \\"Is Israel a Jewish State?\\", The Boston Globe, November 14, 2007, accessed February 11, 2010 =Afghanistan= The Afghan constitution that came into force on January 4, 2004, required that AllƒÅhu akbar be inscribed on Afghanistan's national flag.[ McCarthy, Andrew C., \\"Cold Comfort on Islam and Apostasy; No one who‚Äôs actually read the Afghan constitution should be surprised by the Abdul Rahman case\\", National Review, March 27, 2006, accessed February 11, 2010] =Waziristan= A resistance movement that fought British rule in Waziristan, Pakistan, in the 1930s used a red flag bearing AllƒÅhu akbar in white letters.

Description The Claddagh ring belongs to a group of European finger rings called \\"fede rings\\".Scarisbrick and Henig, Finger Rings, Oxford: Ashmolean Museum, 2003 The name \\"fede\\" derives from the Italian phrase ' (\\"hands [joined] in faith\\" or \\"hands [joined] in loyalty\\"). These rings date from Roman times, when the gesture of clasped hands was a symbol of pledging vows, and they were used as engagement/wedding rings in medieval and Renaissance Europe. Fede rings are distinctive in that the bezel is cut or cast to form two clasped hands that symbolize \\"plighted troth\\".Aubrey, John, Miscellanies, London, 1696: \\"I have seen some Rings made for sweet-hearts, with a Heart enamelled held between two right hands.\\" The Claddagh ring is a variation on the fede ring, while the hands, heart, and crown motif was used in England in the early 18th century.Enamelled gold fede ring, set with rose-cut diamonds in silver collets, with a crowned heart held by two hands inscribed \\"Dudley & Katherine united 26.Mar. 1706\\" ‚Äî Victoria and Albert Museum Towards the end of the 20th century there was an explosion of interest in the Claddagh Ring, both as jewelry and as an icon of Irish heritage. In recent years it has been embellished with interlace designs and combined with other Celtic and Irish symbols, but this is a very recent phenomenon that corresponds with the worldwide expansion in popularity of the Claddagh ring as an emblem of Irish identity.Stephen Walker (2013) The Modern History of Celtic Jewellery: 1840-1980, Walker Metalsmiths . Origins Galway has produced Claddagh rings continuously since at least 1700, but the name \\"Claddagh ring\\" was not used before the 1830s.A freely available but incomplete copy of Delamer's article, The Claddagh Ring (1996), without pictures.Pearsall, Judy [ed.]. (2004) \\"Claddagh Ring\\" in The Concise Oxford Dictionary, Oxford University Press. Although there are various myths and legends around the origin of the Claddagh ring, it is almost certain that it originated in or close to the small fishing village of Claddagh in Galway. As an example of a maker, Bartholomew Fallon was a 17th-century Irish goldsmith, based in Galway, who made Claddagh rings until circa 1700. His name first appears in the will of one Dominick Martin, also a jeweller, dated 26 January 1676, in which Martin willed Fallon some of his tools. Fallon continued working as a goldsmith until 1700. His are among the oldest surviving examples of the Claddagh ring, in many cases bearing his signature.Adrian James Martyn. (2001) The Tribes of Galway, p. 60. There are many legends about the origins of the ring, particularly concerning Richard Joyce, a silversmith from Galway circa 1700, who is said to have invented the Claddagh design as we know it.George Quinn. (1970) The Claddagh Ring, The Mantle, 13:9‚Äì13. Legend has it that Joyce was captured and enslaved by Algerian Corsairs around 1675 while on a passage to the West Indies; he was sold into slavery to a Moorish goldsmith who taught him the craft. King William III sent an ambassador to Algeria to demand the release of any and all British subjects who were enslaved in that country, which at the time would have included Richard Joyce. After fourteen years, Joyce was released and returned to Galway and brought along with him the ring he had fashioned while in captivity: what we've come to know as the Claddagh. He gave the ring to his sweetheart, married, and became a goldsmith with \\"considerable success\\".James Hardiman (1820), The History of the Town and County of the Town of Galway, His initials are in one of the earliest surviving Claddagh rings, but there are three other rings also made around that time, bearing the mark of goldsmith Thomas Meade. The Victorian antiquarian Sir William Jones described the Claddagh, and gives Chambers' Book of DaysRobert Chambers. (1863) Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities. as the source, in his book Finger Ring Lore. Jones says: An account written in 1906 by William Dillon, a Galway jeweller, claimed that the \\"Claddagh\\" ring was worn in the Aran Isles, Connemara and beyond.William Dillon. (1906) Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society, 5. Knowledge of the ring and its customs spread within Ireland and Britain during the Victorian period, and this is when its name became established. Galway jewellers began to market it beyond the local area in the 19th century. Further recognition came in the 20th century. In his 1911 book Rings for the Finger, American mineralogist George Frederick Kunz addresses the importance of gold wedding rings in Ireland but does not mention the Claddagh ring. He does, however, include a photo of one, captioned with its correct name. Furthermore, it is unclear exactly how or when the ring was brought to the United States. Usage and symbolism The Claddagh's distinctive design features two hands clasping a heart and usually surmounted by a crown. These elements symbolize the qualities of love (the heart), friendship (the hands), and loyalty (the crown). A \\"Fenian\\" Claddagh ring, without a crown, is a slightly different take on the design but has not achieved the level of popularity of the crowned version. Claddagh rings are relatively popular among the Irish and those of Irish heritage, such as Irish Americans,Paddy Sammon. (2002) Greenspeak: Ireland in Her Own Words , Town House Press, Dublin, Ireland. . as cultural symbols and as friendship, engagement and wedding rings. While Claddagh rings are sometimes used as friendship rings, they are most commonly used as engagement and wedding rings. Mothers sometimes give these rings to their daughters when they come of age. There are several mottos and wishes associated with the ring, such as: \\"Let love and friendship reign.\\"Jo O'Donoghue and Sean McMahon (2004) Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase and Fable In Ireland, the United States, Canada, and other parts of the Irish diaspora, the Claddagh is sometimes handed down mother-to-eldest daughter or grandmother-to-granddaughter.Patricia McAdoo. (2005) Claddagh: The Tale of the Ring: A Galway Tale, Galway Online. . According to Irish author Colin Murphy, a Claddagh ring was worn with the intention of conveying the wearer's relationship status: #On the right hand with the point of the heart toward the fingertips: the wearer is single and might be looking for love. #On the right hand with the point of the heart toward the wrist: the wearer is in a relationship; someone \\"has captured their heart\\" #On the left ring finger with the point of the heart toward the fingertips: the wearer is engaged. #On the left ring finger with the point of the heart toward the wrist: the wearer is married.Colin Murphy and Donal O'Dea. (2006) The Feckin' Book of Everything Irish, Barnes & Nobles, New York, NY, p. 126. There are other localised variations and oral traditions, in both Ireland and the Irish diaspora, involving the hand and the finger on which the Claddagh is worn. Folklore about the ring is relatively recent, not ancient, with \\"very little native Irish writing about the ring\\", hence, the difficulty today in finding any scholarly or non-commercial source that explains the traditional ways of wearing the ring.Se√°n McMahon.

People have been gathering seafood and fishing from the area for millennia. It is one of the oldest former fishing villages in Ireland - its existence having been recorded since the arrival of Christianity in the 5th century.

Galway Bay (Irish: Loch Lurgain or Cuan na Gaillimhe) is a large bay (or sea lough) on the west coast of Ireland, between County Galway in the province of Connacht to the north and the Burren in County Clare in the province of Munster to the south. Galway city is located on the northeast side of the bay. The bay is about long and from to in breadth. The Aran Islands (Oile√°in √Årann) are to the west across the entrance and there are numerous small islands within the bay. To the west of Galway, the rocks are granite but to the south they are limestone. The approaches to the bay between the Aran Islands and the mainland are as follows: * the North Sound (An S√∫nda √≥ Thuaidh) lies between Inishmore and Leitir Meall√°in in Connemara; known as Bealach Locha Lurgan in Irish. * Gregory's Sound (S√∫nda Ghr√≠ogh√≥ra) lies between Inishmore and Inishmaan; known as Bealach na h-√Åite in Irish. * Foul Sound (An S√∫nda Salach) lies between Inishmaan and Inisheer; known as Bealach na Fearbhaighe in Irish. * South Sound (An S√∫nda √≥ Theas), known as Bealach na Finnise in Irish, lies between Inisheer and County Clare. Galway Bay is famous for its unique traditional sailing craft, the Galway hooker.Scott, Richard J (1983) The Galway Hooker. Ward River Press. Special Area of Conservation The coastal parts of Galway Bay have been designated a Special Area of Conservation. This is because of the wide range of important habitat types which include intertidal mud and sandflats, other littoral habitats, coastal lagoons, saltmarshes, turloughs, vegetated cliffs, calcareous grassland and limestone pavements. Galway Bay offers habitat to common seals and otters, and is an important ornithological site for seabirds, waders and waterfowl. The lagoons are slightly brackish and have a diverse flora, including tasselweed and the algae Chaetomorpha linum, Chara canescens and Lamprothamnion papulosum, all of which are lagoon specialists. There are areas of fen dominated by great fen-sedge and black bog-rush, with common reed, purple moor-grass, bogbean and long-stalked yellow-sedge. The turlough at Ballinacourty forms a temporary lake of about in winter. Wetland species found near the exit-hole of the turlough include amphibious bistort, marsh bedstraw and marsh cinquefoil, with silverweed, water mint and creeping bent in the less frequently flooded places near the edge; sedges (Carex spp.) dominate the rest of the area. The orchid-rich grassland occurs on the flanks of some low drumlin hills to the west of Galway City. The plants here are calcium-loving species including kidney vetch, harebell, spring gentian, yellow-wort, greater knapweed, common spotted-orchid, lesser twayblade, pyramidal orchid and some scrubby juniper. An unusual feature of the saltmarshes is that, beside thrift, lax-flowered sea lavender, red fescue, common scurvygrass, common saltmarsh-grass, saltmarsh rush and sea rush, dwarf brown seaweeds are present among the vegetation. Drowning tragedy of 1902 On 4 May 1902, eight fishermen from a nearby village lost their lives while sailing on Galway Bay, near Kilcolgan. Seven (Patrick Folan, Patrick Burns, Patrick McDonagh, John Barrett, Michael Burke, Michael Dwyer and Stephen Hynes) drowned; Patrick Walsh swam to shore at nearby Kilcolgan, but died of exhaustion on the beach. A fundraising campaign was organised for the families of the drowned fishermen.

Some of the attractions of the medieval town are its town wall, Athenry Castle, its priory and its 13th century Anglo-Norman street-plan. The town is also well known by virtue of the song \\"The Fields of Athenry\\". History St. Mary's Parish Church in Athenry. Athenry's name derives from the ford ('√Åth') crossing the river Clarin just east of the settlement. Though other inaccurate explanations are still given, it was called '√Åth na R√≠ogh' ('Ford of the Kings') because it was the home area of the Cen√©l nD√©igill, kings of the Soghain, whose leading lineage were the √ì Mainn√≠n. On some medieval maps of English origin the town is called Kingstown. Originally, Soghain was surrounded by U√≠ Maine to the east, Aidhne to the south, and Maigh Seola to the west. However, after 1135, and by 1152, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair forcibly incorporated it into the newly created tr√≠cha c√©t of Clann Taidg, ruled by lords such as Fearghal √ì Taidg an Teaghlaigh, who expelled the √ì Mainn√≠n family. In the 1230s the √ì Taidg an Teaghlaigh family were in turn displaced by Meyler de Bermingham. The earliest remaining building in the town is Athenry Castle which was built sometime before 1240 by Meyler de Bermingham. In 1241, the Dominican Priory was founded, and became an important center for learning and teaching. It was ostensibly closed during the Protestant Reformation but survived until being desecrated and burned during the Mac an Iarla wars of the 1560s‚Äì80s, and was finally vandalised by Cromwellians in the 1650s. The medieval walls around Athenry are among the most complete and best preserved in Ireland with 70% of original circuit still standing, along with some of the original towers and the original North gate. The remains of the Lorro Gate were partially unearthed in 2007 during the redevelopment of road works in the area. In the centre of the town is the 'square'; markets were held from the 17th century onwards and where the town's late 15th century 'Market Cross' is still located. The monument which is of Tabernacle or Lantern type is the only one of its kind in Ireland and the only medieval cross still standing in situ in the country. A Heritage centre now occupies the remains of the mid-13th century St Mary's Collegiate Church adjacent to the town Square. The original medieval church is largely destroyed but in 1828 a Church of Ireland church was built into its chancel. In 1791, Jean Antoine Coquebert de Montbret visited the town, which he described as: Moyode Castle is another tall 16th-century fortified tower house of the Dolphin family, which went to the Persse family. The castle is now restored and inhabited and is located from the town of Athenry. In 1863, a late Bronze Age shield was found in the vicinity of Athenry, and is now held in the British Museum's collection. Economy and transport Athenry Dominican Priory =Transport= By road, Athenry is served by the M6 motorway which links Galway city to Dublin. By rail, it is served by the Athenry railway station, which opened on 1 August 1851 and lies on the Galway‚ÄìDublin main line of the Irish rail network. The town is at the junction of the Galway‚ÄìDublin line, and the partially complete the Western Railway Corridor (Limerick‚ÄìSligo). =Industry= In 2015, Apple Inc. decided to build a ‚Ç¨850m data center near Athenry, and a similar one in Viborg, Denmark. In May 2018, Apple announced cancellation of the Athenry development. In December 2017, funding was announced for a \\"Food Innovation Hub\\" in Athenry, projected by its promoters to create 360 jobs within 3 years, and to cost in the region of ‚Ç¨3.9m. River Clarin Sport Athenry is home to the Gaelic Athletic Association St. Mary Club, who have won numerous All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championships.

The city of Vladivostok is the administrative center of the krai, as well as the largest city in the Russian Far East. The krai has the largest economy among the federal subjects in the Russian Far East, and a population of 1,956,497 as of the 2010 Census. The krai shares Russia's only border with North Korea, along the Tumen River in Khasansky District in the southwestern corner of the krai. Peter the Great Gulf, the largest gulf in the Sea of Japan, is located along the south coast. Historically part of Manchuria, Primorsky Krai was ceded to the Russian Empire by Qing China in 1860 as part of a region known as Outer Manchuria, forming most of the territory of Primorskaya Oblast. During the Russian Civil War it became part of the Far Eastern Republic before joining the Soviet Union, going through numerous changes until reaching its current form in 1938. Primorsky Krai is home to the Russian Navy's Russian Pacific Fleet. Etymology The name of the krai is derived from the Russian words (), meaning \\"littoral\\" or \\"coastal\\", and (), meaning \\"region\\" or \\"area\\". It is informally known as Primorye (, ) in Russian, and is occasionally translated as Maritime Territory in English. Geography *Borders length ‚Äî over , including of the sea borders. *Highest peak ‚Äî Anik Mountain, *Railroads length ‚Äî (of which are electrified). *Automobile roads length ‚Äî Primorsky Krai, bordered by China (Jilin and Heilongjiang), North Korea (Rason), and the relatively warm‚Äîalthough freezing in winter‚Äîwaters of the Sea of Japan, is the southeasternmost region of Russia, located between the 42¬∞ and 48¬∞ north latitude and 130¬∞ and 139¬∞ east longitude. It is stretched in the meridianal direction, the distance from its extreme northern point to its most southerly point being about . =Topography= Ussuri River Philippovsky Bay, Russky Island Bikin National Park Highlands dominate the territory of the krai. Most of the territory is mountainous, and almost 80% of it is forested. The average elevation is about . Sikhote-Alin is a mountainous formation, extending for the most part of the Krai. It consists of a number of parallel ranges: the Partizansky (Partisan), the Siny (Blue), the Kholodny (Cold), and others. There are many karst caves in the South of Primorye. The relatively accessible Spyashchaya Krasavitsa cave (the Sleeping Beauty) in the Ussuriysky Nature Preserve could be recommended for tourists. There are comparatively well-preserved fragments of the ancient volcanoes in the area. The ranges are cut by the picturesque narrow and deep valleys of the rivers and by large brooks, such as the Partizanskaya, the Kiyevka, the Zerkalnaya, the Cheryomukhovaya, the Yedinka, the Samarga, the Bikin, and the Bolshaya Ussurka. Most rivers in the Krai have rocky bottoms and limpid water. The largest among them is the Ussuri, with a length of . The head of the Ussuri River originates to the East of Oblachnaya Mountain. The vast Khanka Lowlands extends into the West and the South-West of Primorye, carpeted by coniferous-deciduous forest. A part of the Lowland surrounding the largest lake in the Russian Far East, Khanka Lake, is occupied by a forest-steppe. =Coast and islands= The krai's coastline is fairly straight, except for the southernmost section around Vladivostok which contains the Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula. There are numerous islands in this area, the main ones being Lisy Island, Askold Island, Putyatin Island, Skrebtsov island, Sibiryakov Island, the Eug√©nie Archipelago (the largest island of which being Russky Island), the Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago and Furugelm Island. =Flora and fauna= The geographic location of Primorye accounts for the variety of its flora. The territory of Primorye has not been subjected to the ice cover in the past in contrast to the rest of Siberia during the ice ages. This circumstance, as well as the specifics of the geographical situation and the specific features of climate, determine the unique, diversity of the plant world at species and cenotic levels and the richness of plant resources. In the flora of Primorye there are more than two thousand species of higher plants, of which are about 250 species of trees, bushes and ligneous lianas. Flora of mosses and lichens are very diverse. As part of the coastal flora, there are many valuable medicinal, technical and food plants, many relict and endemic species. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List as rare and threatened extermination. There are mountainous tundra areas, conifers and coniferous-deciduous forests, and forest-steppe, which is sometimes called the Far Eastern Prairie, where many ancient plant species have been preserved, including ferns, lotus, and the Chosenia willow. The flora of the territory contains such plants as Taxus cuspidata, Juniperus rigida, Phellodendron amurense, Kalopanax, Aralia elata, Maackia amurensis, Alnus japonica, Actinidia kolomikta, Schisandra chinensis, Celastrus orbiculatus, Thladiantha dubia, Weigela, Eleutherococcus, Flueggea suffruticosa, Deutzia, Nelumbo nucifera, Betula schmidtii, Carpinus cordata, Acer mandshuricum, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Vitis amurensis, Panax ginseng and many others. The fauna of Primorye is also diverse. The following animals are found in the Krai: Ussuri black bear (Ursus thibetanus), Amur tiger, Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Manchurian deer (Cervus elaphus xanthopygos), Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), musk deer (Moschus moschiferus), long-tailed goral (Naemorhedus caudatus), sika deer (Cervus nippon), sable (Martes zibellina), Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni), mandarinka duck (Aix galericulata), black stork (Ciconia nigra), scaly goosander (Mergus squamatus), chestnut- cheeked starling (Sturnia philippensis), black griffon (Aegypius monachus), large-winged cuckoo (family Cuculidae), and others. Among 690 species of birds inhabiting the territory of the former USSR, 350 are found in Primorye. Rich fisheries of salmon, Hucho taimen, lenok and marine fisheries of crab, pollock and other species make the aquatic and maritime environment a valuable resource for the region. However, the rich diversity of wildlife in Primorye is threatened by poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wildlife Fund, Wild Salmon Center, and Russian NGOs including Phoenix Fund are active in the region's wildlife and habitat conservation. Most of the world's population of wild Siberian tigers is found in Primorsky Krai The cliffs Brat (\\"Brother\\") and Sestra (\\"Sister\\") in the environs of Nakhodka. =Climate= *Primorsky Krai is mostly dominated by warm, humid continental climate. *Average annual temperature ‚Äî near in the north of the krai; on the southern coast. *Average annual precipitation ‚Äî 600‚Äì850 mm. History The area was settled by several Tungusic and Turkic tribes, such as the Sushen, the proto-Mongol Shiwei and the Mohe. The Udege people are said to have traditionally settled in territories along the Bikin River long ago, however, they are possibly of Jianzhou Jurchen origin.Discrimination against indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation. (Parallel report submitted to the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, RAIPON, June 13, 2008) During the Balhae Kingdom, most of the krai were within boundaries of the provinces of Dingli, Anbian and Anyuan. After Balhae was conquered by the Khitans, the territory became part of Liao Dynasty's Eastern Circuit and Jin Dynasty's Supin Circuit. It then came under the Mongol and Manchu rule. The acquisition of Siberia by the Tsardom of Russia and the subsequent Russian expansion to the Far East brought the Russians into direct contact with China. The Nerchinsk Treaty of 1689 demarcating the borders of the two states gave all lands lying south of the Stanovoy Mountains, including Primorye, to the Qing Empire. However, with the weakening of the Qing Empire in the second half of the 19th century, Russia began its expansion into the area. In 1858, the towns of Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk were founded. In 1858, Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky signed the Aigun Treaty with China, followed by the Beijing Treaty two years later. As a result of the two treaties, the Sino‚ÄìRussian border shifted south to the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, granting Russia full control of Primorye. Primorskaya Oblast was established as the easternmost division of the Russian Empire in 1856. It included the territory of modern Primorsky Krai as well as the territories of modern Khabarovsk Krai and Magadan Oblast, stretching from Vladivostok to the Chukchi Peninsula in the far north. In the period from 1859 to 1882, ninety-five settlements were established in the Primorye region, including Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Razdolnoye, Vladimiro-Aleksandrovskoye, Shkotovo, Pokrovka, Tury Rog, and Kamen-Rybolov. The population was primarily engaged in hunting, fishing and cultivation. More than two-thirds of the territory's inhabitants followed these occupations. Coat of arms of Primorskaya Oblast in the beginning of the 20th century During the latter part of the 19th century, there was significant resource, industrial and resulting economic development in Primorye. Coal mining became a prominent industry, as did the export of sea-kale, velvet antlers, timber, crab, dried fish, and trepangs. The rapid economic expansion of Primorye was financed in large measure by Russian and foreign capital investment. After the Russian Revolution and the victory of the communists, the new government renamed Primorskaya Oblast as the Zemstvo of Maritime Territory. It was defined as the Far-Eastern Republic (1920‚Äì1922). Within the Russian SFSR, this became Far-Eastern Oblast (1922‚Äì1926) and then Far-Eastern Krai (1926‚Äì1938). The area became a battleground for allied and Bolshevik troops during the Siberian Intervention. In 1922, shortly before the end of the Civil War, Primorye came under Bolshevik control. The new government directed the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the territory. The Soviet Government spent the following ten years combating \\"bourgeois ideology\\" in many areas of life and culture. As a result, the music, theater, literature, and the fine arts of Primorye were censored. Primorsky was the center of the ethnic Korean minority of Russia. The Pos'et Korean National Raion was created under the policy of korenizatsiya. The Krai had 105 both fully and mixed Korean towns where residents used the Korean language as an official language. Nearly 200,000 ethnic Koreans were living in the Krai by the time of their deportation in 1938. The Soviet Union had earlier deported ethnic Chinese from western Siberia. During this period, the Soviet government emphasized centralized planning of the economy. As in the rest of the Soviet Union, priority was given to heavy industry, with a special emphasis on mining and commercial fishing. There was widespread investment in construction of rail and sea transit, and new port facilities were constructed. Primorsky Krai was formed by further subdivision of Far-Eastern Krai in 1938, as part of the Stalin-era policy of \\"unbundling\\". Primorsky Krai, as defined in 1938, corresponds to the northeastern part of the historical region of Outer Manchuria. On April 18, 1942, the region became accidentally involved in World War II, which the United States had entered after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Primorsky Krai was the location where one of 16 United States Army Air Corps B-25 Mitchell medium bombers landed. The group had been launched from USS Hornet to carry out the Doolittle Raid on Japan. Japan and the Soviet Union were not then at war. The landing occurred 40 miles (65 km) west of Vladivostok; the bomber's crew could not return to their base, the aircraft carrier Hornet, by the mission plan.See the article on the Doolittle Raid. The crew later returned home via Iran. During the 1970s, the Soviet Union expanded scientific institutions in Primorye, especially in the city of Vladivostok. Several large research institutions are located here, such as the Institute of Biology and Agriculture, the Pacific Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry, the Institute of Marine Biology, the Pacific Institute of Geography, the Pacific Oceanological Institute, as well as several Institutes affiliated with the Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Science. By the early 1990s, once-small enterprises in the city had developed into large companies. Some of the most prominent include the DVMP (FESCO) shipping company, the Dalmoreprodukt , Progress Arsenyev Aircraft Works, and Vostok Mining. Commercial fishing plays an important part in the economy of the Primorye and includes firms like Vladivostok Trawling and Refrigerating Fleet (VBTRF), the Active Marine Fisheries Base of Nakhodka, and the Fishing and Marine Transport Fleet of Primorye. Numerous enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex were also established in Primorye. The Udege people, led by Pavel Sulyandziga, are trying to gain control over their traditional territories along the Bikin River and in particular a Territory of Traditional Natural Resource Use of federal status. Politics Krai Administration Building During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Primorsky CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). After 1991, the head of the Oblast administration and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament. The Charter of Primorsky Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Primorsky Krai is the province's regional standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the krai Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia. Administrative divisions Economy thumb Primorsky Krai's economy, the most balanced in the Russian Far East, is also the largest in absolute terms. Food production is the most important sector, represented mainly by fish processing. Annual catch exceeds two million tonnes, or one half of the Russian Far East total. Second is machine building, where half of the output is geared toward the fishing industry and shipyards. Defense is another important sector, producing naval vessels and military aircraft. The construction materials industry here provides for the whole Russian Far East. Lead smelting is conducted in Rudnaya Pristan on the coast. The timber industry, though in recession, is still second only to Khabarovsk Krai's with an annual yield of about 3 million cubic meters of timber. Primorsky Krai is the largest coal producer in the Russian Far East and generates more electricity than any other Russian Far East administrative division, but power shortages are common. Agriculture is also important; the krai produces rice, milk, eggs, and vegetables. Primorsky Krai is the Russian Far East's banking and finance center. It has more than 100 banks and affiliates and well- developed futures and stock exchanges. The krai's proximity to Pacific Rim markets gives it an edge over most other Russian Far East administrative divisions in developing foreign trade. Major trade items are seafood products, timber products, and ferrous metals. Major trading partners are Japan, China, and South Korea.Road through Gorniye Kluchi villageThe economy will be further diversified with the addition of as many as 8 government sanctioned casinos to be built in the Primorye Gambling Zone, which encompasses the entire Primorsky Krai. Primorsky Entertainment Resort City, under development by NagaCorp Ltd. of Phnom Penh, Kingdom of Cambodia, will be the largest. The development is expected to cost in the region of RUB11.6 billion (approximately HK$2.7 billion, US$350 million) and have a total footprint of 214.89 hectares. Primorsky Krai's compact territory is well endowed with infrastructure. Its railway density is twice the Russian average. Railroads connect it with China and North Korea. Vladivostok, the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian railway, was surpassed as a port by the nearby Nakhodka-Vostochny Port container, coal and timber terminals. Primorsky Krai-based shipping companies provide 80% of marine shipping services in the Russian Far East. All the krai's significant ports are now open to international shipping. The largest companies in the region include Far-Eastern Energy Company, NNK-Bunker, Mazda Sollers, Vostochny Port. Natural resources =Coal= More than 100 deposits of coal are known in Primorsky Krai.

The main purpose of this list is to disambiguate multiple spellings, to make note of spellings no longer in use for these concepts, to define the concept in one or two lines, to make it easy for one to find and pin down specific concepts, and to provide a guide to unique concepts of Islam all in one place. Separating concepts in Islam from concepts specific to Arab culture, or from the language itself, can be difficult. Many Arabic concepts have an Arabic secular meaning as well as an Islamic meaning. One example is the concept of dawah. Arabic, like all languages, contains words whose meanings differ across various contexts. Arabic is written in its own alphabet, with letters, symbols, and orthographic conventions that do not have exact equivalents in the Latin alphabet (see Arabic alphabet).

The Far Eastern Federal District shares land borders with Mongolia, China and North Korea to its south, and shares maritime borders with Japan to its southeast and with the United States to its northeast. Although commonly considered part of Siberia, the Russian Far East is categorized separately from Siberia in Russian regional schemes (and previously during the Soviet era when it was called the Soviet Far East). Flag of Russian Far East Federal District Terminology In Russia, the region is usually referred to as just \\"Far East\\" (). What is known in English as the Far East is usually referred to as \\"the Asia-Pacific Region\\" (, abbreviated to ), or \\"East Asia\\" (), depending on the context.

Primorskaya Oblast was established as a separate administrative division of the Russian Empire in 1856, with its administrative center at Khabarovsk. Several entities with the name \\"Far East\\" had existed in the first half of the 20th century, all with rather different boundaries: *1920‚Äì1922: the Far Eastern Republic, which included Transbaikal, Amur, Primorskaya, and Kamchatka Oblasts and northern Sakhalin; *1922‚Äì1926: , which included Amur, Transbaikal and Kamchatka Guberniyas and others; *1926‚Äì1938: Far-Eastern Krai, which included modern Primorsky and Khabarovsk Krais. Until 2000, the Russian Far East lacked officially defined boundaries. A single term \\"Siberia and the Far East\\" () was often used to refer to Russia's regions east of the Urals without drawing a clear distinction between \\"Siberia\\" and \\"the Far East\\". Annual procession with the Albazin icon of Theotokos, Jewish Autonomous Region. In 2000, Russia's federal subjects were grouped into larger federal districts, and the Far Eastern Federal District was created, comprising Amur Oblast, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Kamchatka Oblast with Koryak Autonomous Okrug, Khabarovsk Krai, Magadan Oblast, Primorsky Krai, the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic, and Sakhalin Oblast. In November 2018, Zabaykalsky Krai and the Republic of Buryatia were added, formerly being considered part of the Siberian Federal District. Since 2000, the term \\"Far East\\" has been increasingly used in Russia to refer to the federal district, though it is often also used more loosely. Defined by the boundaries of the federal district, the Far East has an area of ‚Äîover one-third of Russia's total area. =Russo-Japanese War= Russia in the early 1900s persistently sought a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean for the navy as well as to facilitate maritime trade. The recently established Pacific seaport of Vladivostok was operational only during the summer season, but Port Arthur in Manchuria was operational all year. After the First Sino-Japanese War and the failure of the 1903 negotiations between Japan and the Tsars's government, Japan chose war to protect its domination of Korea and adjacent territories. Russia, meanwhile, saw war as a means of distracting its populace from government repression and of rallying patriotism in the aftermath of several general strikes. Japan issued a declaration of war on 8 February 1904. However, three hours before Japan's declaration of war was received by the Russian Government, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the Russian Far East Fleet at Port Arthur. Eight days later Russia declared war on Japan. The war ended in September 1905 with a Japanese victory following the fall of Port Arthur and the failed Russian invasion of Japan through the Korean Peninsula and Northeast China; also, Japan had threatened to invade Primorsky Krai via Korea. The Treaty of Portsmouth was later signed and both Japan and Russia agreed to evacuate Manchuria and return its sovereignty to China, but Japan was allowed to lease the Liaodong Peninsula (containing Port Arthur and Talien), and the Russian rail system in southern Manchuria with its access to strategic resources. Japan also received the southern half of the Island of Sakhalin from Russia. Russia was also forced to confiscate land from Korean settlers who formed the majority of Primorsky Krai's population due to a fear of an invasion of Korea and ousting of Japanese troops by Korean guerrillas. =Soviet era= Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the RSFSR (1926 census) Between 1937 and 1939, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin deported over 200,000 Koreans to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, fearing that the Koreans might act as spies for Japan. Many Koreans died on the way in cattle trains due to starvation, illness, or freezing conditions. Many community leaders were purged and executed, and Koryo-saram were not allowed to travel outside of Central Asia for the next 15 years. Koreans were also not allowed to use the Korean language and its use began to become lost with the involvement of Koryo-mar and the use of Russian. Development of numerous remote locations relied on GULAG labour camps during Stalin's rule, especially in the region's northern half. After that, the large-scale use of forced labour waned and was superseded by volunteer employees attracted by relatively high wages. Soviet‚ÄìJapanese conflicts During the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Soviets occupied Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island, Yinlong Island, and several adjacent islets to separate the city of Khabarovsk from the territory controlled by a possibly hostile power.Russian possession of the eastern half of these lands was recognized by People's Republic of China in the treaty of 2004, whereas the western half was then returned to China. Indeed, Japan turned its military interests to Soviet territories. Conflicts between the Japanese and the Soviets frequently happened on the border of Manchuria between 1938 and 1945. The first confrontation occurred in Primorsky Krai, the Battle of Lake Khasan was an attempted military incursion of Manchukuo (Japanese) into the territory claimed by the Soviet Union. This incursion was founded in the beliefs of the Japanese side that the Soviet Union misinterpreted the demarcation of the boundary based on the Treaty of Peking between Imperial Russia and Manchu China. Primorsky Krai was always threatened by a Japanese invasion despite the fact that most of the remaining clashes occurred in Manchukuo. The clashes ended shortly before the conclusion of the World War II when a weakened Japan found its territories of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, Korea, and South Sakhalin invaded by Soviet and Mongolian troops. World War II Primorsky Krai was a strategic location in World War II for both the Soviet Union and Japan and clashes over the territory were common as the Soviets and the Allies considered it a key location to invade Japan through Korea, and Japan viewed it as a key location to begin a mass invasion of Eastern Russia. Primorsky Krai also served as the Soviet Union's Pacific headquarters in the war to plan an invasion for allied troops of Korea in order to reach Japan. After the Soviet invasion, Manchukuo and Mengjiang were returned to China and Korea became liberated. The Soviet Union also occupied and annexed Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin. Soviet invasion of Japan proper never happened. Cold War During the Korean War, Primorsky Krai became the site of extreme security concern for the Soviet Union. Vladivostok was the site of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in 1974. At the time, the Soviet Union and the United States decided quantitative limits on various nuclear weapons systems and banned the construction of new land-based ICBM launchers. Vladivostok and other cities in Primorsky Krai soon became closed cities because of the base of the Soviet Pacific Fleet. Incursions of American reconnaissance aircraft from nearby Alaska sometimes happened. These concerns of the Soviet military caused the infamous Korean Air Lines Flight 007 incident in 1983. Russian Homestead Act In 2016, President Vladimir Putin proposed the Russian Homestead Act to populate the Russian Far East. Russian-Japanese relations in the 21st century Japanese citizens can visit Russian Vladivostok under a simplified visa regime. A simplified electronic visa to Primorsky Krai in 2016 brought 1338 citizens of Japan. Demographics =Population= Students in Vladivostok celebrating St. Tatyana's Day, or Russian Students Day Graph depicting population change in the Russian Far East According to the 2010 Census, Far Eastern Federal District had a population of 6,293,129. Most of it is concentrated in the southern parts. Given the vast territory of the Russian Far East, 6.3 million people translates to slightly less than one person per square kilometer, making the Russian Far East one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world. The population of the Russian Far East has been rapidly declining since the dissolution of the Soviet Union (even more so than for Russia in general), dropping by 14% in the last fifteen years. The Russian government had been discussing a range of re-population programs to avoid the forecast drop to 4.5 million people by 2015, hoping to attract in particular the remaining Russian population of the near abroad but eventually agreeing on a program to resettle Ukrainian Illegal immigrants. Ethnic Russians and Ukrainians make up the majority of the population. =Cities= 75% of the population is urban. The largest cities are: Vladivostok *Vladivostok *Khabarovsk *Ulan-Ude *Chita *Komsomolsk-on-Amur *Blagoveshchensk *Yakutsk *Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky *Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk *Nakhodka *Ussuriysk =Ukrainian Resettlement Program= In 2016, an ambitious program was approved which hoped to resettle at least 500,000 Ukrainians in the Far East. This included giving free land to attract voluntary immigrants from Ukraine and the settlement of refugees from East Ukraine. =Traditional ethnic groups= The original population groups of the Russian Far East include (grouped by language group): *Mongolic: Buryats *Turkic: Sakha *Eskimo‚ÄìAleut: Aleuts, Siberian Yupiks (Yuits) *Chukotko- Kamchatkan: Chukchi, Koryaks, Alutors, Kereks, Itelmens *Tungusic: Evenks, Evens, Nanais, Orochs, Ul'ch, Udegey, Orok, Manchus *Isolate: Koreans, Yukaghirs, Nivkhs, Ainus Transportation Transportation on the Lena River The region was not connected with the rest of Russia via domestic highways, until the M58 highway was completed in 2010. Uniquely for Russia, most cars have right-hand drive (73% of all cars in the region), though traffic still flows on the right-hand side of the road. Railways are better developed. The Trans-Siberian Railway and Baikal‚ÄìAmur Mainline (since 1984) provide a connection with Siberia (and the rest of the country). The Amur‚ÄìYakutsk Mainline is aimed to link the city of Yakutsk to the Russian railway network. Passenger trains connect to Nizhny Bestyakh as of 2013. Like in nearby Siberia, for many remote localities, aviation is the main mode of transportation to/from civilisation, but the infrastructure is often poor. Maritime transport is also important for delivering supplies to localities at (or near) the Pacific and Arctic coasts.

Life insurance proceeds are not taxable in many jurisdictions. Since most other forms of income are taxable (such as capital gains, dividends and interest income), consumers are often advised to purchase life insurance policies to either offset future tax liabilities, or to shelter the growth of their investments from taxation. This insurance product is also known as Private placement life insurance. Life insurance to cover future taxes In those jurisdictions where life insurance proceeds are only tax free at death, tax liabilities that come due at death are often offset by a policy of the same size. Since the mathematics required to compare different strategies is quite complex, most consumers defer to an accountant or life insurance agent for advice. However, there is often vast differences of opinion between these professionals, even given the same starting conditions. This should not be surprising, given the huge future differences that even small variances in starting conditions can make. For example, assume that an individual is likely to owe $100,000.00 in taxes at death. If a permanent life insurance policy with a $100,000.00 death benefit costs $1,000 per year (remaining level for life), and the life expectancy of the person is 30 years, then the following events could occur. * The individual could die early. In this case, it is unlikely that any alternative investment of the $1000 per year would have yielded the required $100,000.00 at death. * The individual could live much longer than expected. The individual could have built up a significant cash value within the policy, depending on investment selection. As such, the individual would have access to these cash values tax- free regardless of growth, provided it is set up properly. Since one normally does not know which of these will occur (see adverse selection) calculations must be based on expected life expectancies for people of similar gender, physical condition, and behaviour. Life insurance to shelter investment growth and income In an attempt to achieve the \\"best of both worlds\\" (protection in the case of early death, and additional tax-protected returns in the case of long life), life insurance policies were created containing investment accounts having preferential tax treatment. This is most often done with a Variable universal life policy. See that article for some discussion of the tax issues.

She was a columnist for The Washington Post, became the first Washington editor-at-large and political director of The Huffington Post, and has provided political commentary for CNN, CNBC, and MSNBC. She worked for the RIAA for 16 years, including as CEO from 1998 to 2003. Since 2010, she has been a partner and managing director at the public relations firm SKDKnickerbocker. She has been a registered lobbyist during her career, both at the RIAA and for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). Rosen has been an advocate for LGBT rights since the early 1980s. Early life Rosen was born to a Jewish familyWashington Post: \\"Hilary Rosen Washington Post Contributor\\" retrieved February 2, 2017 in West Orange, New Jersey in 1958. Her father worked as an insurance agent and her mother was the city's first councilwoman. In high school, Rosen served as student council president. She earned her bachelor's degree in international business from George Washington University in 1981. Her parents divorced while Rosen was at college. Career In 1979, Rosen began working as a legislative assistant in the Washington, D.C. office of Governor Brendan Byrne (D-NJ), who was a friend of Rosen's mother. She also worked for Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) early in her career. Rosen worked for the lobbying firm Liz Robbins Associates in the 1980s. =Recording Industry Association of America= In 1987, Rosen joined the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the trade organization representing the American recording industry, as its first government relations director. In 1989, she and her colleague Jay Berman updated the Parental Advisory label and launched its public awareness campaign. In 1992, she took a brief leave from the RIAA to serve as Senator Dianne Feinstein's transition director and set up the California Democratic Party's office in Washington, D.C. As a registered lobbyist from 1999 to 2003, Note: User must query the Lobbying Disclosure Act Database using \\"Rosen, Hilary\\" as the registered \\"Lobbyist Name\\". Rosen influenced the decisions made by Congress on behalf of nearly 350 companies and thousands of artists represented by the RIAA. In 1995, Rosen supported artists' rights when Bob Dole, then Senate Majority Leader, criticized Time Warner and said that rap lyrics promoted violence and were degrading to women. She became the organization's president and chief operating officer in May 1996. Rosen was a strong supporter of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which became law in 1998, to prohibit the creation of technologies used to get around copyright protections. Rosen was promoted to the role of chief executive officer in 1998. In 1999, the RIAA Diamond certification was awarded for the first time, recognizing albums that have shipped more than 10 million copies. Rosen said the award, which was named as such because \\"diamonds are valuable [and] no two are alike\\", represented \\"a quantum leap\\" for the music industry and an expansion of the national music market. In 2000, the American musical recording company A&M; Records along with several others, through the RIAA, sued Napster on grounds of copyright infringement under the DMCA,17 U.S.C. A&M; Records. Inc. v. Napster. Inc. 114 F. Supp. 2d 896 (N. D. Cal. 2000). which led to the shutting down of the pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing service. As the face of the RIAA, Rosen was vilified by proponents of free file sharing, and even traveled with security at one point because she was receiving death threats. Nonetheless, Rosen encouraged partnerships between the recording industry and online music businesses, and consulted on the launch of digital music services such as Apple Inc.'s iTunes Store. Rosen was recognized for advancing the industry's political efforts and appeared on lists of influential leaders, including Entertainment Weekly \\"Annual Power List\\" and National Journal \\"Washington's Powerful Insiders\\". She was included in The Hollywood Reporter list of the most powerful women in entertainment in 1998, 2000 (number 10), 2002 (number 17), and 2003 (number 10). Rosen resigned from the RIAA in June 2003 to spend more time with her family. Following her resignation, she reportedly \\"questioned the value of lawsuits against individual downloaders\\" said she had attempted to \\"push the industry to evolve\\". In 2007, she said, \\"I won't be a George Tenet here, but it's pretty well known that I was impatient with the pace of the industry's embrace of online distribution of music. There's no substitute for speed when times are dire. The record companies had valid reasons for their caution, but that caution let the situation get out of hand.\\" =Media roles= Rosen is a Democratic strategist and political pundit. She was a regular political columnist for The Washington Post, has authored articles for many national publications, and provided political commentary for CNBC and MSNBC. In 2008, she became a CNN contributor, appearing on regular programming as well as special political coverage. Also, in 2008, Rosen became the first Washington editor-at-large and political director of The Huffington Post. In 2010, she and The Huffington Post, which was editorially critical of BP following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, reached a mutual decision to part ways when Rosen's firm, Brunswick Group, began consulting for the British oil and gas company. In April 2012, Rosen was criticized for saying that Ann Romney had \\"never worked a day in her life\\" when discussing Mitt Romney's reliance on his wife as an adviser on women's issues during a CNN appearance. Rosen apologized the next day. In 2013, Rosen began writing for The Washington Post as an opinion contributor. According to the New York Times, Rosen bought over half a million fake Twitter followers. Rosen described it as \\"an experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked\\"; however, records indicate Rosen made dozens of purchases between 2015 and 2017. =Communications consultant= In 2006, Rosen and Jay Berman, who formerly worked at RIAA, briefly ran the firm Berman Rosen Global Strategies, consulting for tech companies such as Facebook, Viacom, and XM. In 2008, she joined the public relations firm Brunswick Group to head its Washington, D.C. office. In 2010, Rosen became a partner and managing director at the political communications and public relations firm SKDKnickerbocker, leading the company alongside Anita Dunn.Rosen joining SKDKnickerbocker: The firm is known for its work on progressive issues and focuses on Democrats in its political work. The firm also is employed by TransCanada Corporation to improve their public relations.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/us/politics/anita-dunn- both-insider-and-outsider-in-obama- camp.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0&pagewanted;=print As a communications consultant, Rosen attended the White House on multiple occasions during Barack Obama's presidency. At least five meetings were with the president to discuss messaging around his health care reform plans. Following her 2012 comments regarding Ann Romney, Rosen was the subject of critical coverage by some media outlets, which noted White House visitor logs and speculated whether Rosen or SKDKnickerbocker employees were operating as \\"unofficial\\" or \\"unregistered\\" lobbyists. Rosen has advised many national candidates, and in 2012 The Wall Street Journal reported that she was consulting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz during her time as chair of the Democratic National Committee. SKDKnickerbocker was selected by Edie Windsor's legal team to lead the public relations efforts behind the challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act (United States v. Windsor, 2013). In 2014, Rosen and Dunn served as senior advisors to the LGBT rights group Americans for Marriage Equality. Planned Parenthood hired Rosen to help manage the 2015 undercover videos controversy. Rosen and SKDKnickerbocker were assisting Susan G. Komen for the Cure with a public relations campaign for an environmental research initiative when the Planned Parenthood controversy arose. =Controversies= During the campaigning leading up to the 2012 United States presidential election, Rosen criticized Ann Romney, wife of then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney, claiming that, as a stay-at-home mother, Romney \\"never worked a day in her life.\\" Rosen was pressured to apologize when her remarks were condemned by the Democratic National Committee and President Obama, who stated he had \\"little patience for commentary about the spouses of political candidates.\\" Michelle Obama also distanced herself from Rosen, expressing on Twitter that \\"every mother works hard, and every woman deserves to be respected.\\" Rosen was criticized in December 2017 for making two tweets calling several Georgetown Hoyas fans \\"anti-Semitic,\\" singling one out as a \\"bigot\\" after she noticed a photograph of a fan wearing a bacon costume. After Rosen was told that the fan in question was known as \\"bacon man\\" and wore the costume because of his last name (Bakan, pronounced \\"bacon\\"), she apologized. In January 2018, Hilary Rosen, had admitted she bought more than 500,000 fake Twitter followers as \\"an experiment,\\" to see whether to recommend the practice to her PR clients. In March 2020 she was criticized for telling Bernie Sanders presidential campaign chair Nina Turner that she had \\"no standing\\" to compare Senator Joe Biden to the disappointing \\"white moderate\\", a reference to a statement by Martin Luther King Jr., in his 1963 Letter from a Birmingham jail. Rosen also mistakenly corrected Turner, stating that King only objected to the 'silence' of the \\"white moderate\\" not the comfort of the 'white moderate' with the status quo as Turner had stated. In fact Dr. King stated that \\"the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice\\" was more of an obstacle to freedom than the Ku Klux Klanner.https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/dem-strategist- apologizes-saying-sanders-surrogate-had-no-stand-use-n1151586 She apologized on Twitter in a now deleted tweet, stating \\"Pls no need to defend me and attack angry black women. They have standing. I always need to listen more than I talk. We rise together.\\".https://www.newsweek.com/hilary-rosen- apologizes-saying-nina-turner-not-have-standing-use-words-martin-luther-king- jr-1490910 Rosen was subsequently derided for her use of the pejorative phrase \\"angry black women\\" which is a racial trope. Rosen then apologized a second time on Twitter stating that she was \\"humbly sorry\\" and would never refer to Nina Turner as an 'angry black woman' and only wanted people who were using the phrase against Ms. Turner to stop. LGBT advocacy Rosen became an LGBT activist starting in 1982 when she and others demanded federal intervention to combat HIV/AIDS in the United States. She outed herself to members of Congress in an attempt to win HIV/AIDS funding. In 2004, she managed the successful campaign to defeat George W. Bush's proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same-sex marriage. Her work on this campaign is profiled in John Harwood and Gerald Seib's book Pennsylvania Avenue: Profiles in Backroom Power (2008). Between 2004 and 2008, Rosen was a registered lobbyist for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States. In 2008, she served as interim director for the organization. She also served on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation board. The Advocate included Rosen in their \\"People of the Year\\" list in 2008. Rosen consulted on the Hollingsworth v. Perry (originally Perry v. Schwarzenegger) series of federal court cases that legalized same-sex marriage in California. Rosen was included in The Advocate \\"Out100\\" list for her work on the \\"Respect for Marriage Coalition\\" media campaign during the Defense of Marriage Act challenge and United States v. Windsor civil rights case. She was also named one of the 25 \\"most powerful LGBT players\\" in Washington, D.C., by National Journal and ranked number 62 in Out 2012 \\"Power List\\".\\"The Power List\\": National Journal included Rosen in their list of the \\"30 Most Influential Out Washingtonians\\" in 2014. Inspired by Showtime's LGBT television series The L Word, Rosen collaborated with the show's creator to establish OurChart.com, a social networking site for lesbians. Its name refers to \\"the chart\\", which was used on the show to illustrate the relationships between characters. The site was defunct by 2012, having been acquired by Showtime. In 1992, she helped found Rock the Vote, a non-profit organization that encourages voter turnout among young voters. Rosen and Tammy Haddad co-host the annual Garden Brunch prior to the White House Correspondents' Association's dinner.  Personal life  Rosen met Elizabeth Birch in 1994. Birch was a lawyer for Apple and later became the executive director of the Human Rights Campaign. The couple adopted twins Anna and Jake from Texas in 1999.https://www.instagram.com/p/BiuD1IbHZ91/ They received some criticism from conservative groups who opposed LGBT adoption. The two separated in 2006. Rosen has lived in Washington, D.C. since her studies at George Washington University. She is well-connected and has been called a \\"Washington insider\\". Al Gore and Greta van Susteren were among guests who attended her fiftieth birthday celebration. In addition to being a Democratic strategist, Rosen has described herself as a \\"strong, progressive Democrat\\". She has been a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for candidates, including Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA). She has also been a longtime supporter of Hillary Clinton and supports Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. She has made many personal financial contributions to politicians and groups such as the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and Kennedy for Senate 2000.

This is in contrast to a common good such as wild fish stocks in the ocean, which is non- excludable but is rivalrous to a certain degree, as if too many fish are harvested, the stocks will be depleted. Public goods include knowledge, official statistics, national security, common language(s), flood control systems, lighthouses, and street lighting. Public goods that are available everywhere are sometimes referred to as global public goods. Examples of public good knowledge is men's, women's and youth health awareness, environmental issues, maintaining biodiversity, sharing and interpreting contemporary history with a cultural lexicon, particularly about protected cultural heritage sites and monuments, popular and entertaining tourist attractions, libraries and universities. Many public goods may at times be subject to excessive use resulting in negative externalities affecting all users; for example air pollution and traffic congestion. Public goods problems are often closely related to the \\"free-rider\\" problem, in which people not paying for the good may continue to access it. Thus, the good may be under- produced, overused or degraded.Rittenberg and Tregarthen. Principles of Microeconomics, Chapter 6, Section 4. p. 2 . Retrieved 20 June 2012 Public goods may also become subject to restrictions on access and may then be considered to be club goods; exclusion mechanisms include toll roads, congestion pricing, and pay television with an encoded signal that can be decrypted only by paid subscribers. There is a good deal of debate and literature on how to measure the significance of public goods problems in an economy, and to identify the best remedies.  Terminology, and types of goods  Paul A. Samuelson is usually credited as the economist who articulated the modern theory of public goods in a mathematical formalism, building on earlier work of Wicksell and Lindahl. In his classic 1954 paper The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure, See also he defined a public good, or as he called it in the paper a \\"collective consumption good\\", as follows: > [goods] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each individual's > consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions from any other > individual's consumption of that good... This is the property that has become known as non-rivalry. A pure public good exhibits a second property called non-excludability: that is, it is impossible to exclude any individuals from consuming the good. However, many goods may satisfy the two public good conditions (non-rivalry and non-excludability) only to a certain extent or only some of the time. These goods are known as impure public goods. The opposite of a public good is a private good, which does not possess these properties. A loaf of bread, for example, is a private good; its owner can exclude others from using it, and once it has been consumed, it cannot be used by others. A good that is rivalrous but non- excludable is sometimes called a common-pool resource. Such goods raise similar issues to public goods: the mirror to the public goods problem for this case is the 'tragedy of the commons'. For example, it is so difficult to enforce restrictions on deep-sea fishing that the world's fish stocks can be seen as a non-excludable resource, but one which is finite and diminishing. = Definition matrix = Elinor Ostrom proposed additional modifications to the classification of goods to identify fundamental differences that affect the incentives facing individuals # Replacing the term \\"rivalry of consumption\\" with \\"subtractability of use\\". # Conceptualizing subtractability of use and excludability to vary from low to high rather than characterizing them as either present or absent. # Overtly adding a very important fourth type of good‚Äîcommon-pool resources‚Äîthat shares the attribute of subtractability with private goods and difficulty of exclusion with public goods. Forests, water systems, fisheries, and the global atmosphere are all common-pool resources of immense importance for the survival of humans on this earth. # Changing the name of a \\"club\\" good to a \\"toll\\" good since many goods that share these characteristics are provided by small scale public as well as private associations. = Challenges in identifying public goods = The definition of non-excludability states that it is impossible to exclude individuals from consumption. Technology now allows radio or TV broadcasts to be encrypted such that persons without a special decoder are excluded from the broadcast. Many forms of information goods have characteristics of public goods. For example, a poem can be read by many people without reducing the consumption of that good by others; in this sense, it is non-rivalrous. Similarly, the information in most patents can be used by any party without reducing consumption of that good by others. Official statistics provide a clear example of information goods that are public goods, since they are created to be non-excludable. Creative works may be excludable in some circumstances, however: the individual who wrote the poem may decline to share it with others by not publishing it. Copyrights and patents both encourage the creation of such non-rival goods by providing temporary monopolies, or, in the terminology of public goods, providing a legal mechanism to enforce excludability for a limited period of time. For public goods, the \\"lost revenue\\" of the producer of the good is not part of the definition: a public good is a good whose consumption does not reduce any other's consumption of that good. Debate has been generated among economists whether such a category of \\"public goods\\" exists. Steven Shavell has suggested the following: > when professional economists talk about public goods they do not mean that > there are a general category of goods that share the same economic > characteristics, manifest the same dysfunctions, and that may thus benefit > from pretty similar corrective solutions...there is merely an infinite > series of particular problems (some of overproduction, some of > underproduction, and so on), each with a particular solution that cannot be > deduced from the theory, but that instead would depend on local empirical > factors. There is a common misconception that public goods are goods provided by the public sector. Although it is often the case that government is involved in producing public goods, this is not always true. Public goods may be naturally available, or they may be produced by private individuals, by firms, or by non-state groups, called collective action. The theoretical concept of public goods does not distinguish geographic region in regards to how a good may be produced or consumed. However, some theorists, such as Inge Kaul, use the term \\"global public good\\" for a public good which is non-rivalrous and non- excludable throughout the whole world, as opposed to a public good which exists in just one national area. Knowledge has been argued as an example of a global public good,Joseph E. Stiglitz, \\"Knowledge as a Global Public Good\\" in Global Public Goods, but also as a commons, the knowledge commons. Aggregate demand (Œ£MB) is the sum of individual demands (MBi) Graphically, non-rivalry means that if each of several individuals has a demand curve for a public good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the aggregate demand curve for the public good. This is in contrast to the procedure for deriving the aggregate demand for a private good, where individual demands are summed horizontally. Some writers have used the term \\"public good\\" to refer only to non-excludable \\"pure public goods\\" and refer to excludable public goods as \\"club goods\\".  Examples  Yosemite National Park, an example of an environmental good. Common examples of public goods include: defence, public fireworks, lighthouses, clean air and other environmental goods, and information goods, such as official statistics, open- source software, authorship, public television and radio, and invention. Some goods, like orphan drugs, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but cannot be classified as public goods since they do not fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified in economic terms as quasi- public goods because excludability is possible, but they do still fit some of the characteristics of public goods.Pucciarelli F., Andreas Kaplan (2016) Competition and Strategy in Higher Education: Managing Complexity and Uncertainty, Business Horizons, Volume 59 The provision of a lighthouse is a standard example of a public good, since it is difficult to exclude ships from using its services. No ship's use detracts from that of others, but since most of the benefit of a lighthouse accrues to ships using particular ports, lighthouse maintenance can be profitably bundled with port fees (Ronald Coase, The Lighthouse in Economics 1974). This has been sufficient to fund actual lighthouses. Technological progress can create new public goods. The most simple examples are street lights, which are relatively recent inventions (by historical standards). One person's enjoyment of them does not detract from other persons' enjoyment, and it currently would be prohibitively expensive to charge individuals separately for the amount of light they presumably use. Official statistics are another example. The government's ability to collect, process and provide high-quality information to guide decision-making at all levels has been strongly advanced by technological progress. On the other hand, a public good's status may change over time. Technological progress can significantly impact excludability of traditional public goods: encryption allows broadcasters to sell individual access to their programming. The costs for electronic road pricing have fallen dramatically, paving the way for detailed billing based on actual use. Some question whether defense is a public good. Murray Rothbard argues: > national defense' is surely not an absolute good with only one unit of > supply. It consists of specific resources committed in certain definite and > concrete ways‚Äîand these resources are necessarily scarce. A ring of defense > bases around New York, for example, cuts down the amount possibly available > around San Francisco.\\" Jeffrey Rogers Hummel and Don Lavoie note, > \\"Americans in Alaska and Hawaii could very easily be excluded from the U.S. > government's defense perimeter, and doing so might enhance the military > value of at least conventional U.S. forces to Americans in the other forty- > eight states. But, in general, an additional ICBM in the U.S. arsenal can > simultaneously protect everyone within the country without diminishing its > services\\". Public goods are not restricted to human beings. It is one aspect of the study of cooperation in biology.  Free rider problem  Public goods are often associated with the free rider problem, a form of market failure, in which market-like behavior of individual gain-seeking does not produce economically efficient results. The production of public goods results in positive externalities which are not remunerated. If private organizations do not reap all the benefits of a public good which they have produced, their incentives to produce it voluntarily might be insufficient. Consumers can take advantage of public goods without contributing sufficiently to their creation. This is called the free rider problem, or occasionally, the \\"easy rider problem\\" (because consumers' contributions will be small but non-zero). If too many consumers decide to \\"free-ride\\", private costs exceed private benefits and the incentive to provide the good or service through the market disappears. The market thus fails to provide a good or service for which there is a need. The free rider problem depends on a conception of the human being as homo economicus: purely rational and also purely selfish‚Äîextremely individualistic, considering only those benefits and costs that directly affect him or her. Public goods give such a person an incentive to be a free rider. For example, consider national defense, a standard example of a pure public good. Suppose homo economicus thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all of the millions of other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that he or she could get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service. On the other hand, the free rider knows that he or she cannot be excluded from the benefits of national defense, regardless of whether he or she contributes to it. There is also no way that these benefits can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people. The free rider would not voluntarily exert any extra effort, unless there is some inherent pleasure or material reward for doing so (for example, money paid by the government, as with an all- volunteer army or mercenaries). The free-riding problem is even more complicated than it was thought to be until recently. Any time non- excludability results in failure to pay the true marginal value (often called the \\"demand revelation problem\\"), it will also result in failure to generate proper income levels, since households will not give up valuable leisure if they cannot individually increment a good.Graves, P. E., \\"A Note on the Valuation of Collective Goods: Overlooked Input Market Free Riding for Non- Individually Incrementable Goods \\", The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy 9.1 (2009). This implies that, for public goods without strong special interest support, under-provision is likely since cost-benefit analysis is being conducted at the wrong income levels, and all of the ungenerated income would have been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations. In the case of information goods, an inventor of a new product may benefit all of society, but hardly anyone is willing to pay for the invention if they can benefit from it for free. In the case of an information good, however, because of its characteristics of non-excludability and also because of almost zero reproduction costs, commoditization is difficult and not always efficient even from a neoclassical economic point of view.  Efficient production levels of public goods  The Pareto optimal provision of a public good in a society occurs when the sum of the marginal valuations of the public good (taken across all individuals) is equal to the marginal cost of providing that public good. These marginal valuations are, formally, marginal rates of substitution relative to some reference private good, and the marginal cost is a marginal rate of transformation that describes how much of that private good it costs to produce an incremental unit of the public good.) This contrasts to the Pareto optimality condition of private goods, which equates each consumer's valuation of the private good to its marginal cost of production.Brown, C. V.; Jackson, P. M. (1986), \\"The Economic Analysis of Public Goods\\", Public Sector Economics, 3rd Edition, Chapter 3, pp. 48‚Äì79. For an example, consider a community of just two consumers and the government is considering whether or not to build a public park. One person is prepared to pay up to $200 for its use, while the other is willing to pay up to $100. The total value to the two individuals of having the park is $300. If it can be produced for $225, there is a $75 surplus to maintaining the park, since it provides services that the community values at $300 at a cost of only $225. The classical theory of public goods defines efficiency under idealized conditions of complete information, a situation already acknowledged in Wicksell (1896). Samuelson emphasized that this poses problems for the efficient provision of public goods in practice and the assessment of an efficient Lindahl tax to finance public goods, because individuals have incentives to underreport how much they value public goods. Subsequent work, especially in mechanism design and the theory of public finance developed how valuations and costs could actually be elicited in practical conditions of incomplete information, using devices such as the Vickrey‚ÄìClarke‚ÄìGroves mechanism. Thus, deeper analysis of problems of public goods motivated much work that is at the heart of modern economic theory.  Local public goods  The basic theory of public goods as discussed above begins with situations where the level of a public good (e.g., quality of the air) is equally experienced by everyone. However, in many important situations of interest, the incidence of benefits and costs is not so simple. For example, when people keep an office clean or monitor a neighborhood for signs of trouble, the benefits of that effort accrue to some people (those in their neighborhoods) more than to others. The overlapping structure of these neighborhoods is often modeled as a network. (When neighborhoods are totally separate, i.e., non- overlapping, the standard model is the Tiebout model.) Recently, economists have developed the theory of local public goods with overlapping neighborhoods, or public goods in networks: both their efficient provision, and how much can be provided voluntarily in a noncooperative equilibrium. When it comes to efficient provision, networks that are more dense or close-knit in terms of how much people can benefit each other have more scope for improving on an inefficient status quo. However, voluntary provision is typically below the efficient level, and equilibrium outcomes tend to involve strong specialization, with a few individuals contributing heavily and their neighbors free-riding on those contributions.  Ownership  An important question regarding public goods is whether they should be owned by the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as Oliver Hart (1995) argue that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete. The incomplete contracting paradigm has been applied to public goods by Besley and Ghatak (2001). They consider the government and a non- governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently it has been shown that the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.

The two main varieties are Wei√übier, based on the German tradition, and Witbier, based on the Belgian tradition; other types include Lambic (made with wild yeasts and bacteria), Berliner Weisse (a cloudy, sour beer), and Gose (a German-type sour, salty, herbal beer). Varieties Wei√übier (German ‚Äì \\"white beer\\") uses at least 50% wheat to barley malt to make a light coloured top-fermenting beer. Witbier (Dutch ‚Äì \\"white beer\\") uses flavorings such as coriander and orange peel. Belgian white beers are often made with raw unmalted wheat. German Wei√übier and Belgian witbier are termed \\"white beers\\" because \\"wheat\\" has the same etymological root as \\"white\\" in most West Germanic languages (including English). Other wheat beer styles, such as Berliner Wei√üe, Gose, and Lambic, are made with a significant proportion of wheat. =Weizenbier = A German Hefeweizen glass Weizenbier or Hefeweizen, in the southern parts of Bavaria usually called Wei√übier (literally \\"white beer\\", but the name probably derives from Weizenbier, \\"wheat beer\\"), is a beer, traditionally from Bavaria, in which a significant proportion of malted barley is replaced with malted wheat. By German law, Wei√übiers brewed in Germany must be fermented using a \\"top- fermenting\\" yeast, which is technically an \\"ale yeast\\".Eric Warner, German Wheat Beer. Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications, 1992. Specialized strains of yeast are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of fermentation. Wei√übier is so called because it was, at the time of its inception, paler in color than Munich's traditional brown beer. It is well known throughout Germany, though better known as Weizen (\\"Wheat\\") outside Bavaria. The terms Hefeweizen (\\"yeast wheat\\") or Hefewei√übier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term Kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or Kristallwei√übier (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is filtered to remove the yeast and wheat proteins which contribute to its cloudy appearance. The Hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness (about 15 IBUs) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four volumes), considered important to balance the beer's relatively malty sweetness. Another balancing flavor note unique to Hefeweizen beer is its phenolic character; its signature phenol is 4-vinyl guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, the result of fermentation by top-fermenting yeast appropriate for the style. Hefeweizen's phenolic character has been described as \\"clove\\" and \\"medicinal\\" (\\"Band-aid\\") but also smoky. Other more typical but less assertive flavour notes produced by Wei√übier yeast include \\"banana\\" (amyl acetate), \\"bubble gum\\", and sometimes \\"vanilla\\" (vanillin). Wei√übier is available in a number of other forms, including Dunkelweizen (dark wheat) and Weizenstarkbier (strong wheat beer), commonly referred to as Weizenbock. The dark wheat varieties are made with darker, more highly kilned malts (both wheat and barley). The Weizenbocks typically have a much higher alcohol content than their lighter cousins. The four largest brands in Germany are Erdinger, Paulaner, Franziskaner, and Maisel. Other renowned brands are Augustiner, Weihenstephaner, Schneider (a bronze-coloured specialty), and Andechser. Regional brands in Bavaria are Hopf, Unertl, Ayinger, Schweiger and Plank. Aventinus is an example of Weizen Doppelbock, stronger and darker version of Weizenbock, made by the G. Schneider & Sohn brewery in Kelheim. British brewers producing cask-conditioned varieties include Oakleaf Eichenblatt Bitte, Hoskins White Dolphin, Fyfe Weiss Squad and Oakham White Dwarf. =Witbier= Witbier, white beer, bi√®re blanche, or simply witte is a barley/wheat, top-fermented beer brewed mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins which cause the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. It is a descendant from medieval beers which were flavored and preserved with a blend of spices and other plants such as coriander, orange, and bitter orange referred to as \\"gruit\\" instead of using hops. The style was revived by Pierre Celis at the Hoegaarden Brewery in Belgium and the Celis Brewery in the United States . and is traditionally made with up to 50% raw wheat rather than wheat malt. The beers have a somewhat sour taste due to the presence of lactic acid or acetic acid, much more pronounced in the past than today. Also, the suspended yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in the bottle. =Other varieties= A minor variety of wheat beer is represented by Berliner Wei√üe (Berlin White), which is low in alcohol (2.5% to 3% ABV) and intentionally tart. Sweetened syrups of lemon, raspberry or woodruff herb are often added before drinking. Leipziger Gose is similar to Berliner Wei√üe but slightly stronger at around 4% ABV. Its ingredients include coriander and salt, which are unusual for German beers. Belgian Lambic is also made with wheat and barley, but differs from nearly all beers in the use of wild yeast for spontaneous fermentation. A variation on the barley wine style involves adding a large quantity of wheat to the mash bill, resulting in what is referred to as wheat wine. This style originated in the United States in the 1980s. Names and types Wheat beers vary in name according to the place in which they are brewed and small variations in the recipe. Among those used are: * Wei√übier, short Wei√üe: \\"Wei√ü\\" is German for \\"white\\". These terms are used almost exclusively in the southern German state of Bavaria and in Austria. * Weizenbier, short Weizen: \\"Weizen\\" is German for \\"wheat\\". These terms are used in the western (Baden- W√ºrttemberg) and northern German regions for Wei√übier. * Hefewei√übier or Hefeweizen: \\"Hefe\\" is the German word for yeast, added to indicate that the beer is bottle-conditioned (unfiltered) and thus might have sediment. * Kristallwei√übier or Kristallweizen: \\"Kristall\\" being German for crystal, added if Wei√übier is filtered clear of sediment. * Dunkles Wei√übier or Dunkelweizen: a dark version of a wheat beer (\\"dunkel\\" is the German word for \\"dark\\"). * Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the bock style originating in Germany. * Witbier (Literally, \\"white beer\\") or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer. * Bi√®re blanche (Literally, \\"white beer\\"): The French language name for wheat beer. Serving Bavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in , vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 250ml glass; each brewery (Hoegaarden, Dentergems, etc.) has its own shape of glass. Berliner Wei√üe is often served in a schooner. Kristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass. This is not traditional in Bavaria, and is generally frowned upon there. The modern American custom appears to have originated in Portland, Oregon in the mid-1980s, where the Dublin Pub served Widmer Brothers Brewery's Weizenbier with a slice of lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavor of the Cascade hops. In northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer-lasting foam.Weizenbier or wheat beer A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is cola-weizen, which is a mix of cola and Weizenbier. Another mixture popular during the summer is a radler variant with a 50‚Äì50 mix of Wei√übier with lemonade called \\"Russ\\", which is the German term for Russian. When serving a bottled unfiltered wheat beer hold the glass on an angle and pour slowly. With about 10% or 15% left swirl smoothly to suspend the yeast, then add to improve the flavor, scent and appearance. Sensory profile Wei√übiers feature fermentation by-products such as esters (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially isoamyl acetate, reminiscent of bananas, and the phenolic compound guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, which smells and tastes like cloves. Other phenolics sometimes found in Wei√übiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Wei√übiers is close to 15 International Bitterness Units, a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low. The ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill. The carbonation level can range from 5.5 grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7 grams per liter, or more. This produces a generous stand of foam, especially in light of the high protein content of wheat malt.

A lens flare Lens flare refers to a phenomenon wherein light is scattered or flared in a lens system, often in response to a bright light, producing a sometimes undesirable artifact within the image. This happens through light scattered by the imaging mechanism itself, for example through internal reflection and forward scatter from material imperfections in the lens. Lenses with large numbers of elements such as zooms tend to exhibit greater lens flare, as they contain a relatively large number of interfaces at which internal scattering may occur. These mechanisms differ from the focused image generation mechanism, which depends on rays from the refraction of light from the subject itself. Flare manifests itself in two ways: as visible artifacts and as glare across the image. The glare makes the image look \\"washed out\\" by reducing contrast and color saturation (adding light to dark image regions, and adding white to saturated regions, reducing their saturation). Visible artifacts, usually in the shape of the aperture made by the iris diaphragm, are formed when light follows a pathway through the lens that contains one or more reflections from the lens surfaces. Flare is particularly caused by very bright light sources. Most commonly, this occurs when shooting toward the Sun (when the Sun is in frame or the lens is pointed sunward), and is reduced by using a lens hood or other shade. For good-quality optical systems, and for most images (which do not have a bright light shining into the lens), flare is a secondary effect that is widely distributed across the image and thus not visible, although it does reduce contrast.  Manifestation  CCTV camera lens. The spatial distribution of the lens flare typically manifests as several starbursts, rings, or circles in a row across the image or view. Lens flare patterns typically spread widely across the scene and change location with the camera's movement relative to light sources, tracking with the light position and fading as the camera points away from the bright light until it causes no flare at all. The specific spatial distribution of the flare depends on the shape of the aperture of the image formation elements. For example, if the lens has a 6-bladed aperture, the flare may have a hexagonal pattern. Such internal scattering is also present in the human eye, and manifests in an unwanted veiling glare most obvious when viewing very bright lights or highly reflective surfaces. In some situations, eyelashes can also create flare-like irregularities, although these are technically diffraction artifacts. When a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view, lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast. This can be avoided by shading the lens using a lens hood. In a studio, a gobo or set of barn doors can be attached to the lighting to keep it from shining on the camera. Filters can be attached to the camera lens which will also minimise lens flare, which is especially useful for outdoor photographers. When using an anamorphic lens, as is common in analog cinematography, lens flare can manifest itself as horizontal lines. This is most commonly seen in car headlights in a dark scene, and may be desired as part of the \\"film look\\".  Deliberate use  Lens flare on Borobudur stairs to enhance the sense of ascending A lens flare is often deliberately used to invoke a sense of drama. A lens flare is also useful when added to an artificial or modified image composition because it adds a sense of realism, implying that the image is an un-edited original photograph of a \\"real life\\" scene. For both of these reasons (implying realism and/or drama) artificial lens flare is a common effect in various graphics editing programs, although its use can be a point of contention among professional graphic designers. Lens flare was one of the first special effects developed for computer graphics because it can be imitated using relatively simple means. Basic flare-like effects, for instance in computer and video games, can be obtained using static or animated starburst, ring, and disc textures that are moved according to the position of the light source. More sophisticated rendering techniques have been developed based on ray tracing or photon mapping. Lens flare was typically avoided by Hollywood cinematographers, but when filming Easy Rider, Harrison Arnold was forced to modify a camera car for his Arriflex, which resulted in numerous lens flares as he shot motorcycle footage against Southwestern U.S. landscapes. Costume designer Rita Riggs would sometimes purposely dress Bea Arthur in Maude in a red that would flare to make a statement, to match Maude's personality as a \\"red flag\\". Director J. J. Abrams added numerous lens flares to his films Star Trek and Super 8 by aiming powerful off-camera light sources at the lens. He explained in an interview about Star Trek: \\"I wanted a visual system that felt unique. I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think, 'Oh that's ridiculous, that was too many.' But I love the idea that the future was so bright it couldn't be contained in the frame.\\" Many complained of the frequent use; Abrams admitted it was \\"overdone, in some places.\\" David Boyd, the director of photography of the sci-fi Firefly series, desired this style so much (harkening back to 1970s television), that he sent back cutting-edge lenses that reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones.Whedon, Firefly: the complete series: \\"Serenity\\" commentary The first deliberate lens flare was made by cinematographer Hiroshi Segawa in the movie Woman in the Dunes in 1964. Earlier in the movies, lens flare was considered as defect and was strongly avoided. Director Michael Bay, well known for heavy use of CGI in his films, digitally adds lens flares to most light sources in his films.  Other forms of photographic flare  = Filter flare = The use of photographic filters can cause flare, particularly ghosts of bright lights (under central inversion).Filter Flare , Paul van Walree 2003‚Äì2010 This can be eliminated by not using a filter, and reduced by using higher-quality filters or narrower aperture. = Diffraction artifact in digital cameras = One form of flare is specific to digital cameras. With the sun shining on an unprotected lens, a group of small rainbows appears. This artifact is formed by internal diffraction on the image sensor, which acts like a diffraction grating. Unlike true lens flare, this artifact is not visible in the eyepiece of a digital SLR camera, making it more difficult to avoid.

This diurnal motion leaves star trails in exposures like this one taken at La Silla Observatory. Motion blur is the apparent streaking of moving objects in a photograph or a sequence of frames, such as a film or animation. It results when the image being recorded changes during the recording of a single exposure, due to rapid movement or long exposure. Usages / Effects of motion blur = Photography = London bus passing a telephone box in London 1920s example of motion blur When a camera creates an image, that image does not represent a single instant of time. Because of technological constraints or artistic requirements, the image may represent the scene over a period of time. Most often this exposure time is brief enough that the image captured by the camera appears to capture an instantaneous moment, but this is not always so, and a fast moving object or a longer exposure time may result in blurring artifacts which make this apparent. As objects in a scene move, an image of that scene must represent an integration of all positions of those objects, as well as the camera's viewpoint, over the period of exposure determined by the shutter speed. In such an image, any object moving with respect to the camera will look blurred or smeared along the direction of relative motion. This smearing may occur on an object that is moving or on a static background if the camera is moving. In a film or television image, this looks natural because the human eye behaves in much the same way. Because the effect is caused by the relative motion between the camera, and the objects and scene, motion blur may be manipulated by panning the camera to track those moving objects. In this case, even with long exposure times, the moving objects will appear sharper while the background will become more blurred, with the resulting image conveying a sense of movement and speed.Motion blur in photography, Click and Learn Photography =Animation= Two animations rotating around a figure, with motion blur (left) and without In computer animation this effect must be simulated as a virtual camera actually does capture a discrete moment in time. This simulated motion blur is typically applied when either the camera or objects in the scene move rapidly. Without this simulated effect each frame shows a perfect instant in time (analogous to a camera with an infinitely fast shutter), with zero motion blur. This is why a video game with a frame rate of 25-30 frames per second will seem staggered, while natural motion filmed at the same frame rate appears rather more continuous. Many modern video games feature motion blur, especially vehicle simulation games. Some of the better-known games that utilise this are the recent Need for Speed titles, Unreal Tournament III, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, among many others. There are two main methods used in video games to achieve motion blur: cheaper full-screen effects, which typically only take camera movement (and sometimes how fast the camera is moving in 3-D Space to create a radial blur) into mind, and more \\"selective\\" or \\"per-object\\" motion blur, which typically uses a shader to create a velocity buffer to mark motion intensity for a motion blurring effect to be applied to or uses a shader to perform geometry extrusion. Classic \\"motion blur\\" effects prior to modern per-pixel shading pipelines often simply drew successive frames on top of each other with slight transparency, which is strictly speaking a form of video feedback. In pre-rendered computer animation, such as CGI movies, realistic motion blur can be drawn because the renderer has more time to draw each frame. Temporal anti-aliasing produces frames as a composite of many instants. Frames are not points in time, they are periods of time. If an object makes a trip at a linear speed along a path from 0% to 100% in four time periods, and if those time periods are considered frames, then the object would exhibit motion blur streaks in each frame that are 25% of the path length. If the shutter speed is shortened to less than the duration of a frame, and it may be so shortened as to approach zero time in duration, then the computer animator must choose which portion of the quarter paths (in our 4 frame example) they wish to feature as \\"open shutter\\" times. They may choose to render the beginnings of each frame, in which case they will never see the arrival of the object at the end of the path, or they may choose to render the ends of each frame, in which case they will miss the starting point of the trip. Most computer animations systems make the classic \\"fence-post error\\" in the way they handle time, confusing the periods of time of an animation with the instantaneous moments that delimit them. Thus most computer animation systems will incorrectly place an object on a four frame trip along a path at 0%, 0.33%, 0.66%, and 1.0% and when called upon to render motion blur will have to cut one or more frames short, or look beyond the boundaries of the animation, compromises that real cameras don't do and synthetic cameras needn't do. Motion lines in cel animation are drawn in the same direction as motion blur and perform much the same duty. Go motion is a variant of stop motion animation that moves the models during the exposure to create a less staggered effect. =Computer graphics= In 2D computer graphics, motion blur is an artistic filter that converts the digital imageMotion Blur Effect, TutorialsRoom/bitmapPhotoshop - Motion Blur, tizag.com/raster image in order to simulate the effect. Many graphical software products (e.g. Adobe Photoshop or GIMP) offer simple motion blur filters. However, for advanced motion blur filtering including curves or non-uniform speed adjustment, specialized software products (e.g. VirtualRig Studio) are necessary.Traditional motion blur methods, virtualrig-studio.com = Biology = When an animal's eye is in motion, the image will suffer from motion blur, resulting in an inability to resolve details. To cope with this, humans generally alternate between saccades (quick eye movements) and fixation (focusing on a single point). Saccadic masking makes motion blur during a saccade invisible. Similarly, smooth pursuit allows the eye to track a target in rapid motion, eliminating motion blur of that target instead of the scene. = Motion smear and Wind Turbines = Birds cannot properly see the swirling blades of wind turbines and can get struck by them fatally. A newly published report from Norway suggests that painting one of the three blades with a black tip, makes the blades more visible and hence more avoidable. This reduces the ‚Äúmotion smear‚Äù of the unpainted blades, and cuts bird deaths by 70 per cent. Motion smear = Propeller Accident = Golfer Jack Newton walks into spinning propellor he does not see. Negative effects of motion blur A taxicab starting to drive off blurred the girl's faces in the image. In televised sports, where conventional cameras expose pictures 25 or 30 times per second, motion blur can be inconvenient because it obscures the exact position of a projectile or athlete in slow motion. For this reason special cameras are often used which eliminate motion blurring by taking rapid exposures on the order of 1 millisecond, and then transmitting them over the course of the next 30 to 40 milliseconds. Although this gives sharper slow motion replays it can look strange at normal speed because the eye expects to see motion blurring and is not provided with blurred images. Conversely, extra motion blur can unavoidably occur on displays when it is not desired. This occurs with some video displays (especially LCD) that exhibits motion blur during fast motion. This can lead to more perceived motion blurring above and beyond the preexisting motion blur in the video material. See display motion blur. Sometimes, motion blur can be removed from images with the help of deconvolution. In video games the use or not of motion blur is somewhat controversial. Some gamers claim that the blur actually makes gaming worse since it does blur images, making more difficult to recognize objects, especially in fast-paced moments. This does become noticeable the lower the frame rate is. Improvements in the visual quality of modern post-process motion blur shaders as well as a tendency towards high frame rate video games has lessened the visual detriment of undersampled motion blur effects. Restoration An example of blurred image restoration with Wiener deconvolution: Gallery Image:Motorbike rider mono.jpgMotion blur is frequently employed in sports photography (particularly motor sports) to convey a sense of speed. To achieve this effect it is necessary to use a slow shutter speed and pan the lens of the camera in time with the motion of the object Image:Nightly Rotation above San Jose International Airport.jpgTaken aboard an airplane turning above San Jose at night.

Image:Strickland_Falls_Shadows_Lifted.jpgStrickland Falls in Tasmania, Australia, taken using a neutral density filter. ND filters reduce light of all colors or wavelengths equally, allowing an increase in aperture and decrease in shutter speed without overexposing the image. To create the motion blur seen here, the shutter must be kept open for a relatively long time, making it necessary to reduce the amount of light coming through the lens.

A spasmodic muscle contraction may be caused by many medical conditions, including dystonia. Most commonly, it is a muscle cramp which is accompanied by a sudden burst of pain. A muscle cramp is usually harmless and ceases after a few minutes. It is typically caused by ion imbalance or muscle overload. There are other causes of involuntary muscle contractions, and some of these may cause a health problem. Description and causes Various kinds of involuntary muscle activity may be referred to as a \\"spasm\\". A spasm may be a muscle contraction caused by abnormal nerve stimulation or by abnormal activity of the muscle itself. A series of spasms, or permanent spasms, is called a \\"spasmism\\". A spasm may lead to muscle strains or tears in tendons and ligaments if the force of the spasm exceeds the tensile strength of the underlying connective tissue. This can occur with a particularly strong spasm or with weakened connective tissue. A hypertonic muscle spasm is a condition of chronic, excessive muscle tone (i.e., tension in a resting muscle). This is the amount of contraction that remains when a muscle is not working. A true hypertonic spasm is caused by malfunctioning feedback nerves. This is much more serious and is permanent unless treated. In this case, the hypertonic muscle tone is excessive, and the muscles are unable to relax. A subtype of spasm is colic. This is an episodic pain caused by spasm of smooth muscle in a particular organ (e.g., the bile duct). A characteristic of colic is the sensation of having to move about, and the pain may induce nausea or vomiting.

For this function, it is also the height after rotating the plot 180¬∞ around the vertical axis. In mathematics, particularly in complex analysis, a Riemann surface is a one-dimensional complex manifold. These surfaces were first studied by and are named after Bernhard Riemann. Riemann surfaces can be thought of as deformed versions of the complex plane: locally near every point they look like patches of the complex plane, but the global topology can be quite different. For example, they can look like a sphere or a torus or several sheets glued together. The main interest in Riemann surfaces is that holomorphic functions may be defined between them. Riemann surfaces are nowadays considered the natural setting for studying the global behavior of these functions, especially multi-valued functions such as the square root and other algebraic functions, or the logarithm. Every Riemann surface is a two- dimensional real analytic manifold (i.e., a surface), but it contains more structure (specifically a complex structure) which is needed for the unambiguous definition of holomorphic functions. A two-dimensional real manifold can be turned into a Riemann surface (usually in several inequivalent ways) if and only if it is orientable and metrizable. So the sphere and torus admit complex structures, but the M√∂bius strip, Klein bottle and real projective plane do not. Geometrical facts about Riemann surfaces are as \\"nice\\" as possible, and they often provide the intuition and motivation for generalizations to other curves, manifolds or varieties. The Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem is a prime example of this influence.  Definitions  There are several equivalent definitions of a Riemann surface. # A Riemann surface X is a connected complex manifold of complex dimension one. This means that X is a connected Hausdorff space that is endowed with an atlas of charts to the open unit disk of the complex plane: for every point x ‚àà X there is a neighbourhood of x that is homeomorphic to the open unit disk of the complex plane, and the transition maps between two overlapping charts are required to be holomorphic. # A Riemann surface is an oriented manifold of (real) dimension two ‚Äì a two- sided surface ‚Äì together with a conformal structure. Again, manifold means that locally at any point x of X, the space is homeomorphic to a subset of the real plane. The supplement \\"Riemann\\" signifies that X is endowed with an additional structure which allows angle measurement on the manifold, namely an equivalence class of so-called Riemannian metrics. Two such metrics are considered equivalent if the angles they measure are the same. Choosing an equivalence class of metrics on X is the additional datum of the conformal structure. A complex structure gives rise to a conformal structure by choosing the standard Euclidean metric given on the complex plane and transporting it to X by means of the charts. Showing that a conformal structure determines a complex structure is more difficult.See for the construction of a corresponding complex structure.  Examples  The Riemann sphere. A torus. File:Riemann surface arcsin.svgf(z) = arcsin z File:Riemann surface log.svgf(z) = log z File:Riemann surface sqrt.svgf(z) = z1/2 File:Riemann surface cube root.svgf(z) = z1/3 File:Riemann surface 4th root.svgf(z) = z1/4  Further definitions and properties  As with any map between complex manifolds, a function f: M ‚Üí N between two Riemann surfaces M and N is called holomorphic if for every chart g in the atlas of M and every chart h in the atlas of N, the map h o f o g‚àí1 is holomorphic (as a function from C to C) wherever it is defined. The composition of two holomorphic maps is holomorphic. The two Riemann surfaces M and N are called biholomorphic (or conformally equivalent to emphasize the conformal point of view) if there exists a bijective holomorphic function from M to N whose inverse is also holomorphic (it turns out that the latter condition is automatic and can therefore be omitted). Two conformally equivalent Riemann surfaces are for all practical purposes identical. =Orientability= Each Riemann surfaces, being a complex manifold, is orientable as a real manifold. For complex charts f and g with transition function h = f(g‚àí1(z)), h can be considered as a map from an open set of R2 to R2 whose Jacobian in a point z is just the real linear map given by multiplication by the complex number h'(z). However, the real determinant of multiplication by a complex number Œ± equals Œ±2, so the Jacobian of h has positive determinant. Consequently, the complex atlas is an oriented atlas. = Functions = Every non-compact Riemann surface admits non-constant holomorphic functions (with values in C). In fact, every non- compact Riemann surface is a Stein manifold. In contrast, on a compact Riemann surface X every holomorphic function with values in C is constant due to the maximum principle. However, there always exist non-constant meromorphic functions (holomorphic functions with values in the Riemann sphere C ‚à™ {‚àû}). More precisely, the function field of X is a finite extension of C(t), the function field in one variable, i.e. any two meromorphic functions are algebraically dependent. This statement generalizes to higher dimensions, see . Meromorphic functions can be given fairly explicitly, in terms of Riemann theta functions and the Abel‚ÄìJacobi map of the surface. Analytic vs. algebraic The existence of nonconstant meromorphic functions can be used to show that any compact Riemann surface is a projective variety, i.e. can be given by polynomial equations inside a projective space. Actually, it can be shown that every compact Riemann surface can be embedded into complex projective 3-space. This is a surprising theorem: Riemann surfaces are given by locally patching charts. If one global condition, namely compactness, is added, the surface is necessarily algebraic. This feature of Riemann surfaces allows one to study them with either the means of analytic or algebraic geometry. The corresponding statement for higher-dimensional objects is false, i.e. there are compact complex 2-manifolds which are not algebraic. On the other hand, every projective complex manifold is necessarily algebraic, see Chow's theorem. As an example, consider the torus T := C/(Z + œÑ Z). The Weierstrass function \\\\wp_\\\\tau(z) belonging to the lattice Z + œÑ Z is a meromorphic function on T. This function and its derivative \\\\wp_\\\\tau'(z) generate the function field of T. There is an equation :[\\\\wp'(z)]^2=4[\\\\wp(z)]^3-g_2\\\\wp(z)-g_3, where the coefficients g2 and g3 depend on œÑ, thus giving an elliptic curve EœÑ in the sense of algebraic geometry. Reversing this is accomplished by the j-invariant j(E), which can be used to determine œÑ and hence a torus.  Classification of Riemann surfaces  The set of all Riemann surfaces can be divided into three subsets: hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic Riemann surfaces. Geometrically, these correspond to surfaces with negative, vanishing or positive constant sectional curvature. That is, every connected Riemann surface X admits a unique complete 2-dimensional real Riemann metric with constant curvature equal to -1, 0 or 1 which belongs to the conformal class of Riemannian metrics determined by its structure as a Riemann surface. This can be seen as a consequence of the existence of isothermal coordinates. In complex analytic terms, the Poincar√©- Koebe uniformization theorem (a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem) states that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the following: *The Riemann sphere \\\\widehat{\\\\mathbf{C}} := \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}, which is isomorphic to the \\\\mathbf P^1(\\\\mathbf C) ; *The complex plane \\\\mathbf C; *The open disk \\\\mathbf D := \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbf C : z < 1\\\\\\\\} which is isomorphic to the upper half-plane \\\\mathbf H := \\\\\\\\{z \\\\in \\\\mathbf C : \\\\mathrm{Im}(z) > 0\\\\\\\\}. A Riemann surface is elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic according to whether its universal cover is isomorphic to \\\\mathbf P^1(\\\\mathbf C), \\\\mathbf C or \\\\mathbf D. The elements in each class admit a more precise description. = Elliptic Riemann surfaces = The Riemann sphere \\\\mathbf P^1(\\\\mathbf C) is the only example, as there is no group acting on it by biholomorphic transformations freely and properly discontinuously and so any Riemann surface whose universal cover is isomorphic to \\\\mathbf P^1(\\\\mathbf C) must itself be isomorphic to it. = Parabolic Riemann surfaces = If X is a Riemann surface whose universal cover is isomorphic to the complex plane \\\\mathbf C then it is isomorphic one of the following surfaces: * \\\\mathbf C itself; * The quotient \\\\mathbf C / \\\\mathbf Z; * A quotient \\\\mathbf C / (\\\\mathbf Z + \\\\mathbf Z\\\\tau) where \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\mathbf C with \\\\mathrm{Im}(\\\\tau) > 0. Topologically there are only three types: the plane, the cylinder and the torus. But while in the two former case the (parabolic) Riemann surface structure is unique, varying the parameter \\\\tau in the third case gives non- isomorphic Riemann surfaces. The description by the parameter \\\\tau gives the Teichm√ºller space of \\"marked\\" Riemann surfaces (in addition to the Riemann surface structure one adds the topological data of a \\"marking\\", which can be seen as a fixed homeomorphism to the torus). To obtain the analytic moduli space (forgetting the marking) one takes the quotient of Teichm√ºller space by the mapping class group. In this case it is the modular curve. = Hyperbolic Riemann surfaces = In the remaining cases X is a hyperbolic Riemann surface, that is isomorphic to a quotient of the upper half-plane by a Fuchsian group (this is sometimes called a Fuchsian model for the surface). The topological type of X can be any orientable surface save the torus and sphere. A case of particular interest is when X is compact. Then its topological type is described by its genus g \\\\ge 2. Its Teichm√ºller space and moduli space are 6g - 6-dimensional. A similar classification of Riemann surfaces of finite type (that is homeomorphic to a closed surface minus a finite number of points) can be given. However in general the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of infinite topological type is too large to admit such a description.  Maps between Riemann surfaces  The geometric classification is reflected in maps between Riemann surfaces, as detailed in Liouville's theorem and the Little Picard theorem: maps from hyperbolic to parabolic to elliptic are easy, but maps from elliptic to parabolic or parabolic to hyperbolic are very constrained (indeed, generally constant!). There are inclusions of the disc in the plane in the sphere: \\\\Delta \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\subset \\\\widehat{\\\\mathbf{C}}, but any holomorphic map from the sphere to the plane is constant, any holomorphic map from the plane into the unit disk is constant (Liouville's theorem), and in fact any holomorphic map from the plane into the plane minus two points is constant (Little Picard theorem)! = Punctured spheres = These statements are clarified by considering the type of a Riemann sphere \\\\widehat{\\\\mathbf{C}} with a number of punctures. With no punctures, it is the Riemann sphere, which is elliptic. With one puncture, which can be placed at infinity, it is the complex plane, which is parabolic. With two punctures, it is the punctured plane or alternatively annulus or cylinder, which is parabolic. With three or more punctures, it is hyperbolic ‚Äì compare pair of pants. One can map from one puncture to two, via the exponential map (which is entire and has an essential singularity at infinity, so not defined at infinity, and misses zero and infinity), but all maps from zero punctures to one or more, or one or two punctures to three or more are constant. = Ramified covering spaces = Continuing in this vein, compact Riemann surfaces can map to surfaces of lower genus, but not to higher genus, except as constant maps. This is because holomorphic and meromorphic maps behave locally like z \\\\mapsto z^n, so non- constant maps are ramified covering maps, and for compact Riemann surfaces these are constrained by the Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula in algebraic topology, which relates the Euler characteristic of a space and a ramified cover. For example, hyperbolic Riemann surfaces are ramified covering spaces of the sphere (they have non-constant meromorphic functions), but the sphere does not cover or otherwise map to higher genus surfaces, except as a constant.  Isometries of Riemann surfaces  The isometry group of a uniformized Riemann surface (equivalently, the conformal automorphism group) reflects its geometry: * genus 0 ‚Äì the isometry group of the sphere is the M√∂bius group of projective transforms of the complex line, * the isometry group of the plane is the subgroup fixing infinity, and of the punctured plane is the subgroup leaving invariant the set containing only infinity and zero: either fixing them both, or interchanging them (1/z). * the isometry group of the upper half-plane is the real M√∂bius group; this is conjugate to the automorphism group of the disk. * genus 1 ‚Äì the isometry group of a torus is in general translations (as an Abelian variety), though the square lattice and hexagonal lattice have addition symmetries from rotation by 90¬∞ and 60¬∞. * For genus g ‚â• 2, the isometry group is finite, and has order at most 84(g‚àí1), by Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem; surfaces that realize this bound are called Hurwitz surfaces. * It is known that every finite group can be realized as the full group of isometries of some Riemann surface. ** For genus 2 the order is maximized by the Bolza surface, with order 48. ** For genus 3 the order is maximized by the Klein quartic, with order 168; this is the first Hurwitz surface, and its automorphism group is isomorphic to the unique simple group of order 168, which is the second-smallest non-abelian simple group. This group is isomorphic to both PSL(2,7) and PSL(3,2). ** For genus 4, Bring's surface is a highly symmetric surface. ** For genus 7 the order is maximized by the Macbeath surface, with order 504; this is the second Hurwitz surface, and its automorphism group is isomorphic to PSL(2,8), the fourth-smallest non- abelian simple group.  Function-theoretic classification  The classification scheme above is typically used by geometers. There is a different classification for Riemann surfaces which is typically used by complex analysts. It employs a different definition for \\"parabolic\\" and \\"hyperbolic\\". In this alternative classification scheme, a Riemann surface is called parabolic if there are no nonconstant negative subharmonic functions on the surface and is otherwise called hyperbolic. This class of hyperbolic surfaces is further subdivided into subclasses according to whether function spaces other than the negative subharmonic functions are degenerate, e.g. Riemann surfaces on which all bounded holomorphic functions are constant, or on which all bounded harmonic functions are constant, or on which all positive harmonic functions are constant, etc. To avoid confusion, call the classification based on metrics of constant curvature the geometric classification, and the one based on degeneracy of function spaces the function-theoretic classification. For example, the Riemann surface consisting of \\"all complex numbers but 0 and 1\\" is parabolic in the function-theoretic classification but it is hyperbolic in the geometric classification.

Colloquially, jingoism is excessive bias in judging one's own country as superior to others‚Äîan extreme type of nationalism. Etymology The chorus of a song (by the singer G. H. MacDermott and the songwriter G. W. Hunt, and commonly sung in British pubs and music halls around the time of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78) gave birth to the term. The lyrics included this chorus: The capture of Constantinople (Turkish Language: Istanbul) was a long-standing Russian strategic aim, which would have given the Russian Navy an unfettered access to the Mediterranean; conversely, the British were determined to deny that to the Russians, in order to protect their access to India. At the time when the above song was composed and sung, the Russians had neared that goal, through the Treaty of San Stefano; eventually, the British were able to push the Russians back by means of diplomatic pressure and the threat of war. The phrase \\"by Jingo\\" was a long-established minced oath, used in place of \\"by Jesus\\". Use in this song of the specific term \\"jingoism\\" stems from its coinage by prominent British radical George Holyoake, as a political label, in a letter to the Daily News on 13 March 1878.  Examples  Probably the first uses of the term in the U.S. press occurred in connection with the proposed annexation of Hawaii in 1893, after a coup led by foreign residents, mostly Americans, and assisted by the U.S. minister in Hawaii, overthrew the Hawaiian constitutional monarchy and declared a republic. Republican president Benjamin Harrison and Republicans in the U.S. Senate were frequently accused of jingoism in the Democratic press for supporting annexation.Kansas City Times, 14 February 1893, p. 4 editorial: \\"Jingoism pure and simple.\\" In the 1880s, Henry Hyndman, leader of the Social Democratic Federation, turned against internationalism, and promoted a version of Socialism mixed with nationalism and antisemitismVirdee, Satnam. \\"Socialist Antisemitism and Its Discontents in England, 1884‚Äì98.\\" Patterns of Prejudice 51.3-4 (2017):363 \\\\- even to the point of attacking fellow Socialist Eleanor Marx in antisemitic terms, noting that she had \\"inherited in her nose and mouth the Jewish type from Karl Marx himself\\". When taking part in the breakaway group which founded the Socialist League, Eleanor Marx wrote polemics in which she characterized Hyndman and his followers as \\"The Jingo Party\\".Eleanor Marx letter to wilhelm Liebknecht, 1 January 1885, quoted in Rachel Holmes,\\"Eleanor Marx - A Life\\", Bloomsbury Publishing, London, 2014, p. 223. British artillery major-general Thomas Bland Strange, one of the founders of the Canadian Army and one of the divisional commanders during the 1885 North-West Rebellion, was an eccentric and temperamental soldier who gained the nickname \\"Jingo Strange\\" and titled his 1893 autobiography Gunner Jingo's Jubilee.Strange, Thomas Bland, Gunner Jingo's Jubilee, London, 1893; new edition with an introduction by R.C. Macleod, Edmonton, 1988. Macleod, R.C., \\"Thomas Bland Strange,\\" Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Theodore Roosevelt was frequently accused of jingoism. In an article on 23 October 1895 in New York Times, Roosevelt stated, \\"There is much talk about 'jingoism'. If by 'jingoism' they mean a policy in pursuance of which Americans will with resolution and common sense insist upon our rights being respected by foreign powers, then we are 'jingoes'.\\" The reference is found halfway down the article. In Homage to Catalonia, George Orwell decries the tactics of political journalists and wishes for introduction of airplanes into war in order to finally see \\"a jingo with a bullet hole in him.\\" The policy of appeasement toward Hitler led to satirical references to the disappearance of such jingoistic attitudes when facing German aggression. A cartoon by E.H. Shepard titled \\"The Old-Fashioned Customer\\" appeared on 28 March 1938 issue of Punch.

It differs from a harmony, as the performers take turns performing a solo section rather than performing simultaneously. A piece performed by two pianists performing together on the same piano is a \\"piano duet\\" or \\"piano four hands\\".Christensen, T. (1999). \\"Four-Hand Piano\\". Journal of the American Musicological Society, 52(2) 255‚Äì298 A piece for two pianists performing together on separate pianos is a \\"piano duo\\". \\"Duet\\" is also used as a verb for the act of performing a musical duet, or colloquially as a noun to refer to the performers of a duet. A musical ensemble with more than two solo instruments or voices is called trio, quartet, quintet, sextet, septet, octet, etc.  History  When Mozart was young, he and his sister Marianne played a duet of his composition at a London concert in 1765. The four-hand, described as a duet, was in many of his compositions which included five sonatas; a set of variations, two performers and one instrument, and a sonata for two pianos. The first published sonata or duet was in 1777.Miller, H.-M. (1943). The Earliest Keyboard Duets. The Musical Quarterly, 29(4), 438‚Äì457. In Renaissance music, a duet specifically intended as a teaching tool, to be performed by teacher and student, was called a bicinium (see √âtude).  In opera  Duets have always been a part of the structure of operas. Early 16th-century operas such as L'Orfeo and L'incoronazione di Poppea involve duets throughout the performance. In 17th-century Italy duets were often used in comic scenes within serious operas. In Baroque France the duet was popular in tragedies, such as songs of vengeance and confrontation. The love duet was characterized by singing in close harmonies of 3rds and 6ths, symbolizing unity after conflict. = Famous operatic duets = * La clemenza di Tito by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart * La Cenerentola by Gioachino Rossini * The Puritans of Vincenzo Bellini * Don Pasquale by Gaetano Donizetti * La traviata by Giuseppe Verdi * Aida of Giuseppe Verdi * Mefistofele of Arrigo Boito * Manon Lescaut by Giacomo Puccini *Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini * L'amico Fritz by Pietro Mascagni  In pop music  Johnny Cash & June Carter Throughout the 20th century duets have been common in the popular music of the era. Some songs were written to be heard as conversations, such as \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\". Others were performed around a theme, for example New York in \\"Empire State of Mind\\".

Along with Alfred Sturtevant and H.J. Muller, Bridges was part of Thomas Hunt Morgan's famous \\"Fly Room\\" at Columbia University. Early life Calvin Blackman Bridges was born in Schuyler Falls, New York in 1889 to the parents of Leonard Bridges and Charlotte Blackman. Tragically, Calvin's mother died when he was two years old, and his father died a year later, leaving the young Calvin an orphan. Bridges was subsequently taken in and raised by his grandmother. It took Bridges several years to complete high school, graduating when he was 20 years old. Despite this setback, he moved on to be an outstanding student at Columbia University in New York City, which he attended both undergraduate and postgraduate school. While taking a zoology class at Columbia, Bridges met Thomas Hunt Morgan. This started a relationship which would eventually lead to many important scientific discoveries regarding genetics and evolution. Work and research The \\"Fly Room\\" experiments began in 1910 and continued for seventeen years, with Thomas Hunt Morgan being the project's lead experimental developer.\\"Bridges, Calvin Blackman.\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. Vol. 2. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008. 455-457. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 28 Jan. 2015. Among many others working alongside Bridges and Morgan in the laboratory were Alfred Sturtevant and Hermann Joseph Muller. The \\"Fly Room\\" experiments were the first to use the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster for research in genetics, because they are cheap, easily accessible, and reproduce quickly.Muhlrad, Paul J. \\"Fruit Fly: Drosophila.\\" Genetics. Ed. Richard Robinson. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2003. 42-45. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 28 Jan. 2015. The experiments resulted in many important early discoveries in the field, resolved previously unclear issues such as the organization of genetic information within chromosomes, chromosomal arrangement, and linkage in sex chromosomes, and contributed to the emergence of modern treatments of genetics and evolutionary biology from their classical foundations, all in an era before molecular biology had yet revealed the structure or nature of DNA. The group also contributed to the understanding of the impact of mutations on evolution in general. The success of the \\"Fly Room\\" experiments eventually made D. melanogaster a widely popular model organism for biological research of all types. Bridges in particular was responsible for many improvements regarding the techniques and the equipment used in the experiments. He suggested the use binocular microscopes instead of hand lenses that had been using before, which improved data quality and convenience. Bridges also developed temperature controls for the experiments which proved to be more useful and yielded better results than the previous temperature controls. Bridges published many works, one of his most famous being \\"Sex in Relation to Chromosomes and Genes\\".\\"Bridges, Calvin Blackman.\\" Britannica Biographies (2012): 1. Middle Search Plus. Web. 28 Jan. 2015. He also contributed many items to the Journal of Experimental Zoology and Science. His work with sex- linked traits suggested that chromosomes contained genes; Nettie Maria Stevens was later able to support this hypothesis by examining the chromosomes of the fruit flies. Bridges wrote a couple of papers presenting the proof. He thanked her as \\"Miss Stevens\\" without stating what her contribution was nor referring to her Ph.D. Bridges wrote a masterful PhD thesis on \\"Non-disjunction as proof of the chromosome theory of heredity.\\", which appeared as the first paper in the first issue of the journal Genetics in 1916. In this paper, he also established that the Y chromosome does not determine gender in Drosophila. Bridges' best-known contribution among Drosophila researchers is his observation and documentation of the polytene chromosomes found in larval salivary gland cells. The banding patterns of these chromosomes are still used as genetic landmarks even by contemporary researchers. Bridges was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1936 for his work with Drosophila. After his death, Bridges' student Katherine Brehme Warren completed work on The Mutants of Drosophila melanogaster (1944), a classic book which was for two decades an indispensable resource for geneticists, with information from the \\"Red Book\\" later being transferred to the FlyBase database.Carlson, Elof Axel. \\"Calvin Bridges and the Development of Classical Genetics.\\" Calvin Blackman Bridges, Unconventional Geneticist (1889-1938). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Library and Archives, 2013. Web. 8 February 2015. Morgan and Sturtevant destroyed almost all of Bridges' notebooks after his death, except the four which where not in their possession. Personal life Bridges married Gertrude Ives, with whom he had four children. He was known to be both brilliant and very kind and considerate, though he was equally well-known for his womanizing and his struggles to keep up with family obligations.Genius on the Fly.

From a mathematical perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent multilinear functions and functions between representations of matrix groups. The diagrammatic notation often simplifies calculation because simple diagrams may be used to represent complicated functions. Roger Penrose is credited with the invention of spin networks in 1971, although similar diagrammatic techniques existed before his time. Spin networks have been applied to the theory of quantum gravity by Carlo Rovelli, Lee Smolin, Jorge Pullin, Rodolfo Gambini and others. Spin networks can also be used to construct a particular functional on the space of connections which is invariant under local gauge transformations.  Definition  = Penrose's original definition = A spin network, as described in Penrose (1971),R. Penrose (1971a), \\"Angular momentum: an approach to combinatorial spacetime,\\" in T. Bastin (ed.), Quantum Theory and Beyond, Cambridge University Press (this paper can be found online on John C. Baez's website); and R. Penrose (1971b), \\"Applications of negative dimensional tensors,\\" in D. J. A. Welsh (ed.), Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications (Proc. Conf., Oxford, 1969), Academic Press, pp. 221‚Äì244, esp. p. 241 (the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to Roger Penrose, \\"On the Origins of Twistor Theory\\" in: Gravitation and Geometry, a Volume in Honour of I. Robinson, Biblipolis, Naples 1987). is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the world line of a \\"unit\\" (either an elementary particle or a compound system of particles). Three line segments join at each vertex. A vertex may be interpreted as an event in which either a single unit splits into two or two units collide and join into a single unit. Diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called closed spin networks. Time may be viewed as going in one direction, such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram, but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations. Each line segment is labelled with an integer called a spin number. A unit with spin number n is called an n-unit and has angular momentum nƒß/2, where ƒß is the reduced Planck constant. For bosons, such as photons and gluons, n is an even number. For fermions, such as electrons and quarks, n is odd. Given any closed spin network, a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the norm of the spin network. Norms can be used to calculate the probabilities of various spin values. A network whose norm is zero has zero probability of occurrence. The rules for calculating norms and probabilities are beyond the scope of this article. However, they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm, two requirements must be met at each vertex. Suppose a vertex joins three units with spin numbers a, b, and c. Then, these requirements are stated as: * Triangle inequality: a must be less than or equal to b + c, b less than or equal to a + c, and c less than or equal to a + b. * Fermion conservation: a + b + c must be an even number. For example, a = 3, b = 4, c = 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 is odd, and a = 3, b = 4, c = 9 is impossible since 9 > 3 + 4. However, a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 is possible since 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 is even, and the triangle inequality is satisfied. Some conventions use labellings by half-integers, with the condition that the sum a + b + c must be a whole number. = Formal definition = More formally, a spin network is a (directed) graph whose edges are associated with irreducible representations of a compact Lie group and whose vertices are associated with intertwiners of the edge representations adjacent to it. A spin network, immersed into a manifold, can be used to define a functional on the space of connections on this manifold. One computes holonomies of the connection along every link (closed path) of the graph, determines representation matrices corresponding to every link, multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together, and contracts indices in a prescribed way. A remarkable feature of the resulting functional is that it is invariant under local gauge transformations.  Usage in physics  = In the context of loop quantum gravity = In loop quantum gravity (LQG), a spin network represents a \\"quantum state\\" of the gravitational field on a 3-dimensional hypersurface. The set of all possible spin networks (or, more accurately, \\"s-knots\\"that is, equivalence classes of spin networks under diffeomorphisms) is countable; it constitutes a basis of LQG Hilbert space. One of the key results of loop quantum gravity is quantization of areas: the operator of the area A of a two- dimensional surface Œ£ should have a discrete spectrum. Every spin network is an eigenstate of each such operator, and the area eigenvalue equals :A_{\\\\Sigma} = 8\\\\pi \\\\ell_\\\\text{PL}^2\\\\gamma \\\\sum_i \\\\sqrt{j_i(j_i+1)} where the sum goes over all intersections i of Œ£ with the spin network. In this formula, *PL is the Planck length, *\\\\gamma is the Immirzi parameter and *ji = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... is the spin associated with the link i of the spin network. The two-dimensional area is therefore \\"concentrated\\" in the intersections with the spin network. According to this formula, the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation. Assuming an Immirzi parameter on the order of 1, this gives the smallest possible measurable area of ~10‚àí66 cm2. The formula for area eigenvalues becomes somewhat more complicated if the surface is allowed to pass through the vertices, as with anomalous diffusion models. Also, the eigenvalues of the area operator A are constrained by ladder symmetry. Similar quantization applies to the volume operator. The volume of a 3D submanifold that contains part of a spin network is given by a sum of contributions from each node inside it. One can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary \\"quantum of volume\\" and every link is a \\"quantum of area\\" surrounding this volume. = More general gauge theories = Similar constructions can be made for general gauge theories with a compact Lie group G and a connection form. This is actually an exact duality over a lattice. Over a manifold however, assumptions like diffeomorphism invariance are needed to make the duality exact (smearing Wilson loops is tricky). Later, it was generalized by Robert Oeckl to representations of quantum groups in 2 and 3 dimensions using the Tannaka‚ÄìKrein duality. Michael A. Levin and Xiao-Gang Wen have also defined string-nets using tensor categories that are objects very similar to spin networks. However the exact connection with spin networks is not clear yet. String-net condensation produces topologically ordered states in condensed matter.  Usage in mathematics  In mathematics, spin networks have been used to study skein modules and character varieties, which correspond to spaces of connections.

Car Company Limited was the British sports car manufacturer that made the marque famous. Best known for its open two-seater sports cars, MG also produced saloons and coup√©s, with engines up to three litres in size. The marque is now owned by Chinese automotive giant SAIC Motor Corporation Limited. MG cars had their roots in a 1920s sales promotion sideline of Morris Garages, a retail sales and service centre in Oxford belonging to William Morris. The business's manager, Cecil Kimber, modified standard production Morris Oxfords and added MG Super Sports to the plate at the nose of the car. A separate M.G. Car Company Limited was incorporated in July 1930. It remained Morris's personal property until 1 July 1935, when he sold it to his holding company, Morris Motors Limited. MG underwent many changes in ownership over the years. Morris's Nuffield Organisation merged with Austin to create the British Motor Corporation Limited (BMC) in 1952. Its activities were renamed MG Division of BMC in 1967, and so it was a component of the 1968 merger that created British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). The MG marque continued to be used by the successors of BLMC: British Leyland, the Rover Group and, by the start of 2000, the MG Rover Group, which entered receivership in 2005. The MG marque along with other assets of MG Rover were purchased by Nanjing Automobile Group (which merged into SAIC in 2007). MG production restarted in 2007 in China. The first all-new MG model in the UK for 16 years, the MG 6, was launched on 26 June 2011.  M.G. Car Company  Enamelled badge on an early MG car 1925 'Old Number One' with body by Carbodies William Morris's Morris Garages in Longwall Street, Oxford, was the Oxford agent for his Morris cars. Cecil Kimber joined the dealership as its sales manager in 1921 and was promoted to general manager in 1922. Kimber began promoting sales by producing his own special versions of Morris cars. Debate remains as to when MG car production started, although the first cars, rebodied Morris models that used coachwork from Carbodies of CoventryNorthey, p.1333. and known as \\"Kimber Specials\\",Northey, Tom. \\"MG: A Great Sporting Name\\", in Ward, Ian, Executive Editor. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 12, p.1333. bore both Morris and MG badges. Reference to MG with the octagon badge appears in an Oxford newspaper from November 1923, and the MG Octagon was registered as a trademark by Morris Garages on 1 May 1924. Others dispute this and believe that MG only properly began trading in 1925. Morris Garages assembled their cars in premises in Alfred Lane, Oxford. Demand soon caused a move to larger premises in Bainton Road in September 1925, sharing space with the Morris radiator works. Continuing expansion meant another move in 1927 to a separate factory in Edmund Road, Cowley, Oxford, near the main Morris factory, and for the first time, it was possible to include a production line. In 1928, the company had become large enough to warrant an identity separate from the original Morris Garages, and The M.G. Car Company was used from March of that year. In October, for the first time, a stand was taken at the London Motor Show. Space soon ran out again, and a search for a permanent home led to the lease of part an old leather factory in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1929. A limited liability company named M.G. Car Company was incorporated on 21 July 1930.Company No. 00249645, Companies House accessed 27 August 2019Warwick University: Modern Records Centre MSS.226 - British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Collection Kimber stayed with the company until 1941, when he fell out with Morris over procuring wartime work. Kimber died in 1945 in a railway accident. = Under the Nuffield Organisation = William Morris owned MG personally, and in a re-arrangement of his various personal holdings, he sold MG in 1935 to Morris Motors (itself the leading member of his Morris Organisation, later called the Nuffield Organisation),Wolseley And M.G. Companies. The Times, Friday, 14 June 1935; pg. 20; Issue 47090. a change that was to have serious consequences for MG, particularly its motor-sport activities. Its product range was changed to re-badged Wolseley and Morris products. = Under the British Motor Corporation (BMC) = 1955 ZA Magnette The M.G. Car Company Limited was absorbed along with Morris into The British Motor Corporation Limited (BMC), created in 1952 as a merger of Morris Motors Limited and The Austin Motor Company Limited. Long-time service manager John Thornley took over as general manager, guiding the company through its best years until his retirement in 1969. Under BMC, several MG models were no more than badge-engineered versions of other marques, with the main exception being the small MG sports cars. BMC merged with Jaguar Cars in September 1966, and that December, the new company was named British Motor Holdings (BMH). BMH merged with the Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968 to form British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). = Under British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC) = By now, MG was nothing more than a marque used by BLMC, and from about 1972, the name \\"M.G. Car Company Limited\\" ceased to be used.  MG marque  The marque name apparently originated from the initials of Morris Garages, William Morris's private retail sales and service company.What does the name ‚ÄúM.G.‚Äù mean? mgnuts.com, accessed 11 April 2019 The marque was in continuous use, except for the duration of the Second World War, from its inception in 1924 until 2005, and then from 2007 under Chinese ownership. In the beginning, the marque was used predominantly for two-seater sports cars made at the M.G Car Company factory in Abingdon, some south of Oxford.Motor Sport, February 1932, Pages 168, 171. = Under British Leyland = Following partial nationalisation in 1975, BLMC became British Leyland (later just BL). British Leyland's management and engineering staff were predominantly from the former Leyland organisation, which included MG's historical close rival Triumph. Triumph was grouped into BL's Specialist Division, alongside Rover and Jaguar, while MG was retained with the other former BMC marques in the Austin-Morris Division, which otherwise made mass-production family cars. While new Triumph models such as the TR7 and the Dolomite were launched during the Seventies no new MG models were introduced apart from the limited-production V8 version of the MGB. While the MG operations was profitable these profits were entirely offset by the huge losses accrued by the rest of the Austin-Morris division and any funding to the Division within BL was allocated to urgently required mass market models, leaving MG with limited resources to develop and maintain its existing model range, which became increasingly outdated. Amidst a mix of economic, internal and external politics, the Abingdon factory was shut down on 24 October 1980 as part of the drastic programme of cutbacks necessary to turn BL around after the turbulent times of the 1970s. The last car built there was the MGB, and after the closure of the Abingdon plant, the MG marque was temporarily abandoned, and BL decided that there would be no immediate direct successor to the MGB or Midget. Though many plants were closed within British Leyland, none created such an uproar among workers, dealers, clubs, and customers as this closure did. Years later, Sir Michael Edwardes expressed regret about his decision. Between 1982 and 1991, the MG marque used to badge- engineer sportier versions of Austin Rover's Metro, Maestro, and Montego ranges. The MG marque was not revived in its own right until 1992, with the MG RV8 ‚Äì an updated MGB Roadster with a Rover V8 engine, which was previewed at the 1992 Birmingham Motor Show, with low-volume production commencing in 1993. = Under Rover Group = MG F became the first all-new MG since the MGB After BL became the Rover Group in 1986, ownership of the MG marque passed to British Aerospace in 1988 and then in 1994 to BMW. The MG name was revived for a second time in 1992 with the launch of the MG RV8, followed by the mid- engined MG F in 1995, which proved to be more successful than the short-lived RV8. = Under MG Rover = BMW sold the business in 2000 and the MG marque passed to the MG Rover Group based in Longbridge, Birmingham. The practice of selling unique MG sports cars alongside badge-engineered models (by now Rovers) continued. The Group went into receivership in 2005 and car production was suspended on 7 April 2005. As of 2003, the site of the former Abingdon factory was host to McDonald's and the Thames Valley Police with only the former office block still standing. The headquarters of the MG Car Club (established 1930) is situated next door. In 2006, it was reported that an initiative called Project Kimber, led by David James, had entered talks with Nanjing to buy the MG brand to produce a range of sports cars based on the discontinued Smart Roadster design by DaimlerChrysler. No agreement was reached, which resulted in the AC Cars marque being adopted for the new model, instead. As of 2009, the project appears to be dormant. = Under MG Motor = MG Motor UK HQ ‚Äì SAIC UK Technical & Design Centre Morris Garages On 22 July 2005, the Nanjing Automobile Group purchased the rights to the MG brand along with other assets of the MG Rover Group (except the production line for the ZS model) for ¬£53 million, creating a new company called NAC MG UK. This was later renamed MG Motor, after the merger of Nanjing Automobile with Shanghai Automobile Industry Corporation (SAIC). In 2011, MG Motor launched a new model, the MG 6 in GT (hatchback) and Magnette (saloon), which were the first new-generation MGs available in the UK since the MG TF. The MG Motor MG range is now sold in India, Australia, Brunei, China, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Thailand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom‚Äîavailability of models depending on market. The first all-new MG-branded model for 16 years, the MG 6 (a derivation of the Chinese car Roewe 550Roewe 550), was officially launched on 26 June 2011 during a visit to MG Motor's Longbridge plant by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. By March 2012, SAIC had invested a total of ¬£450 million in MG Motor. Sales in the UK totalled 782 vehicles in 2012. The new MG 3 went on sale in the United Kingdom in September 2013. MG Motor was voted third place for the 'Best Manufacturer' category in the Auto Express 2014 Driver Power survey. MG Motor celebrated the brand's 90th birthday in 2014, and enjoyed further celebrations with a record-breaking year that had the company lead UK car-industry growth in 2014. The MG brand's sales rose by 361% during 2014 thanks in part to the introduction of the MG 3 to the product range. = Car models = The earliest model, the 1924 MG 14/28 consisted of a new sporting body on a Morris Oxford chassis. This car model continued through several versions following the updates to the Morris. The first car that can be described as a new MG, rather than a modified Morris was the MG 18/80 of 1928, which had a purpose-designed chassis and the first appearance of the traditional vertical MG grille. A smaller car was launched in 1929 with the first of a long line of Midgets starting with the M-Type based on a 1928 Morris Minor chassis. MG established a name for itself in the early days of the sport of international automobile racing. Beginning before and continuing after World War II, MG produced a line of cars known as the T-Series Midgets, which, post-war, were exported worldwide, achieving greater success than expected. These included the MG TC, MG TD, and MG TF, all of which were based on the pre-war MG TB, and updated with each successive model. MG departed from its earlier line of Y-Type saloons and pre-war designs and released the MGA in 1955. The MGB was released in 1962 to satisfy demand for a more modern and comfortable sports car. In 1965 the fixed head coup√© (FHC) followed: the MGB GT. With continual updates, mostly to comply with increasingly stringent United States emissions and safety standards, the MGB was produced until 1980. Between 1967 and 1969 a short-lived model called the MGC was released. The MGC was based on the MGB body, but with a larger (and heavier) six-cylinder engine, and somewhat worse handling.Road test accessed 9 August 2020 MG also began producing the MG Midget in 1961. The Midget was a re-badged and slightly restyled second-generation Austin-Healey Sprite. To the dismay of many enthusiasts, the 1974 MGB was the last model made with chrome bumpers due to new United States safety regulations; the 1974¬Ω bore thick black rubber bumpers that some claimed ruined the lines of the car. In 1973, the MGB GT V8 was launched with the ex-Buick Rover V8 engine and was built until 1976. As with the MGB, the Midget design was frequently modified until the Abingdon factory closed in October 1980 and the last of the range was made. The badge was also applied to versions of BMC saloons including the BMC ADO16, which was also available as a Riley, but with the MG pitched as slightly more \\"sporty\\". The marque lived on after 1980 under BL, being used on a number of Austin saloons including the Metro, Maestro, and Montego. In New Zealand, the MG badge even appeared on the late 1980s Montego estate, called the MG 2.0 Si Wagon. There was a brief competitive history with a mid-engined, six-cylinder version of the Metro. The MG Metro finished production in 1990 on the launch of a Rover-only model. The MG Maestro and MG Montego remained on sale until 1991, when Rover cut production of these models to concentrate on the more modern 200 Series and 400 Series. High performance Rover Metro, 200 and 400 GTi models had gone on sale in late 1989 and throughout 1990 as the MG version of the Metro was discontinued in 1990 and the versions of the Maestro and Montego were axed in 1991. The Rover Group revived the two-seater with the MG RV8 in 1992. The all-new MGF went on sale in 1995, becoming the first mass- produced \\"real\\" MG sports car since the MGB ceased production in 1980. Following the May 2000 purchase of the MG and Rover brands by the Phoenix Consortium and the forming of the new MG Rover Group, the MG range was expanded in the summer of 2001 with the introduction of three sports models based on the contemporary range of Rover cars. The MG ZR was based on the Rover 25, the MG ZS on the Rover 45, and the MG ZT/ZT-T on the Rover 75. The MG Rover Group purchased Qvale, which had taken over development of the De Tomaso Bigua. This car, renamed the Qvale Mangusta and already approved for sale in the United States, formed the basis of the MG XPower SV, an \\"extreme\\" V8-engined sports car. It was revealed in 2002 and went on sale in 2004. In 2017, SAIC displayed the first all-new MG concept car for quite some time, when they unveiled the E-Motion at the Shanghai Motor Show. As of June 2020, it was reported that MG is set to launch an electric sports car based on the 2017 E-Motion concept https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mg-e-motion- electric-sports-car-previewed-patent-images Gloster, a full-sized seven- seater SUV, will join MG's line-up as its flagship and fourth offering in India.MG is planning to strengthen its foothold in the Indian market with new products. After the Hector Plus SUV which is slated for July launch, the company has panned yet another SUV for India.It will be launched around Diwali 2020. MG Gloster SUV was showcased in India at the Auto Expo 2020. It is a re- branded Maxus D90 which sells in the Chinese market.The Gloster is expected to be priced between Rs 28 lakh and Rs 35 lakh for indian market. (ex-showroom). In May 2020, MG showed a concept for a successor to the TF which they call the MG Cyberster. https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-mg-cyberster- concept-electric-two-seat-roadster  List of models  1926 14-28 open two-seater 1936 NB Magnette Airline coup√© 1954 TF, the last traditional MG 1970 MGB * Sports cars ** 1924‚Äì1927: MG 14/28 ** 1927‚Äì1929: MG 14/40 ** 1928‚Äì1933: MG 18/80 ** 1929‚Äì1932: MG M-type Midget ** 1931‚Äì1932: MG C-type Midget ** 1931‚Äì1932: MG D-type Midget ** 1931‚Äì1932: MG F-type Magna ** 1932‚Äì1934: MG J-type Midget ** 1932‚Äì1934: MG K-type Magnette ** 1933‚Äì1934: MG L-type Magna ** 1934‚Äì1936: MG N-type Magnette ** 1934‚Äì1936: MG P-type Midget ** 1935-1939: {[MG SA saloon, tourer and drop-head coupe}] ** 1936-1939: {[MG VA saloon, tourer and drop-head coupe}] ** 1938-1939: {[MG WA saloon, tourer and drop-head coupe}] ** 1936‚Äì1940: {[MG 1945‚Äì1955: MG T-type Midget ** 1947-1953: {[MG Y type saloon}] ** 1955‚Äì1962: MGA ** 1961‚Äì1979: MG Midget ** 1962‚Äì1980: MGB ** 1967‚Äì1969: MGC ** 1973‚Äì1976: MGB GT V8 ** 1992‚Äì1995: MG RV8 ** 1995‚Äì2002: MG F ** 2002‚Äì2005 and 2007‚Äì2011: MG TF * Subcompact cars ** 1982‚Äì1990: MG Metro ** 2001‚Äì2005: MG ZR ** 2013‚Äìpresent: MG 3 * Compact cars (Small saloons) ** 1933‚Äì1934: MG KN ** 1962‚Äì1968: MG 1100 ** 1967‚Äì1973: MG 1300 ** 2011‚Äìpresent: MG 6 ** 2012‚Äìpresent: MG 5 * Midsize cars (Medium saloons) ** 1924‚Äì1927: MG 14/28 1925 MG Morris Oxford 14-28 ** 1927‚Äì1929: MG 14/40 ** 1928‚Äì1933: MG 18/80 ** 1937‚Äì1939: MG VA ** 1947‚Äì1953: MG Y-type ** 1953‚Äì1956: MG Magnette ZA ** 1956‚Äì1958: MG Magnette ZB ** 1959‚Äì1961: MG Magnette Mk.

This stopped in 1935 when MG was formally merged with Morris Motors and the Competition Department closed down. A series of experimental cars had also been made allowing Captain George Eyston to take several world speed records. In spite of the formal racing ban, speed record attempts continued with Goldie Gardner exceeding in the 1100 cc EX135 in 1939. After the Second World War record-breaking attempts restarted with 500 cc and 750 cc records being taken in the late 1940s. A decision was also taken to return to racing and a team of MGAs was entered in the tragedy-laden 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race, the best car achieving 12th place. The British Motor Corporation (BMC) competition department was also based at the Abingdon plant, producing many winning rally and race cars, until the Abingdon factory closed and MGB production ceased in the Autumn of 1980. MG / Triple Eight British Touring Cars 2015. MG / Triple Eight British Touring Cars 2012 ‚Äì 2014. Prior to the use of the Toyota Tundra silhouette in the Craftsman Truck Series, MG was reported as the last foreign brand used in NASCAR. It was driven in 1963 by Smokey Cook. In 2001 MG re-launched their motor sport campaign to cover the 24 Hours of Le Mans (MG-Lola EX257), British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) (MG ZS), British and World Rally Championships and MG Independent British Rally Championship (MG ZR). The Le Mans team failed to win the endurance race in 2001 and 2002 and quit in 2003. MG Sport+Racing raced in the British Touring Car Championships with the MG ZS between 2001 and 2003 as a factory team. In 2004 WSR raced the MG ZS as a privateer team. After three years without a major sponsor, WSR teamed up with RAC in 2006 and the team was called Team RAC. In 2007 an MG ZR driven by BRC Stars Champion Luke Pinder won class N1 on Britain's round of the World Rally championship. Wales Rally GB. The MG British Rally Challenge still runs today despite the liquidation in 2005. In 2004 plans to race in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) with a heavily modified V8 powered ZT supertouring car were cancelled due to MG Rover's liquidation in April 2005. In January 2012, MG Motor announced that it would enter the 2012 British Touring Car Championship through the newly established MG KX Momentum Racing team. In its debut season the team ran two MG6s driven by Jason Plato and Andy Neate. Jason ended the season in third place, with the car yet to find its foot in wet conditions. The team returned in 2013 with Sam Tordoff driving, who performed well in his debut year having joined through the KX Academy scheme. Plato once again came third, with Tordoff sixth. MG won the 2014 Manufacturer's Championship to break Honda's four-year reign. After just three years of competition, the MG6 GT sealed the title by 95 points at the season finale at Brands Hatch. Drivers Plato and Tordoff racked up seven wins and 20 podiums in the 30-race calendar. Plato finished the Driver's Championship in second place, behind Colin Turkington, while Tordoff finished seventh. In 2014, a third MG6 GT was on the grid, driven by Marc Hynes‚Äîalso maintained by Triple Eight but in a new livery that didn't resemble the other two MG cars. MG came second in the Constructors Championship in 2015, with Andrew Jordan leading the MG team by finishing the season fifth.

It is a networked multiplayer game that simulates a tank battlefield. It was one of the earliest simultaneous multiplayer networked games. Name Another tank game with the same name was created for the Apple II in 1982. Cheshire says this was \\"an unfortunate coincidence\\". He says that the name comes from the Hindi word for communication, which is \\"bolo\\".  Description  screenshot from the game Players are divided into two teams. Each player commands a tank that can be driven around a battlefield within an orthogonal, top-down view. The tank has a cannon, which fires forward, and it carries mines as a secondary weapon, which can be dropped while moving or be placed somewhere on the map. Tanks have a certain amount of \\"armor\\" (hit points), which is reduced by enemy shots. A tank is destroyed if its armor reaches zero or if it is driven into the sea. Cannon ammunition and mines can be refilled by going to a friendly \\"base\\". The bases also repair damage to tanks, but this depletes the base's armor. Bases' ammunition and armor regenerate slowly. The goal of the game is to capture all of the bases on the map. Neutral bases may be captured by driving one's tank over them. Hostile bases can be made neutral again by shooting them until their armor supply is reduced to zero. Another game element is the \\"pillbox\\". Pillboxes are initially neutral and will shoot at any tank that approaches them. Like the supply bases, pillboxes can be shot at until destroyed, after which a player can restore it, making it friendly. Unlike the bases, pillboxes can be moved around the map by the players. Inside the tank is an engineer, who places mines and moves pillboxes. The engineer can also perform building tasks, after collecting wood in a forest. The structures that can be built are roads, which speed up travel, and walls, which act as a barrier. The engineer can be killed by enemies while out of the tank.

In 1993, Jowers appeared on the ABC news program Prime Time Live and related the details of an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia and the U.S. government to kill the civil rights leader. According to Jowers, the alleged assassin, James Earl Ray, was a scapegoat, and was not the only person responsible for assassinating King. Instead, Jowers said that he hired Memphis police Lieutenant Earl Clark to fire the fatal shot. A Memphis civil trial in 1999 supported this claim, but on June 9, 2000, the United States Department of Justice released a 150-page report rejecting allegations that there was a conspiracy to assassinate King. Martin Luther King Jr. assassination In a 1993 episode of ABC's Primetime Live, Jowers told reporter Sam Donaldson that he hired someone to kill King as a favor to a friend in the mafia, produce merchant Frank Liberto. Jowers said Liberto, who had died prior to the ABC interview, had paid him $100,000 to arrange the assassination. He did not name the person he claimed to have hired, but said it was not Ray. =Coretta Scott King v. Loyd Jowers= In 1998, the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers and \\"other unknown co-conspirators\\" for the murder of King. The King family was represented by attorney William Pepper, who had previously served as the attorney of James Earl Ray, King's formerly accused assassin, in a televised, mock trial. According to The Washington Post, Pepper had \\"for years claimed the assassination was the result of a vast conspiracy involving the FBI, CIA and the Army, organized crime and various state and local officials.\\" After four weeks of testimony which involved over 70 witnesses and thousands of pages of new evidence, a Memphis jury unanimously found, on December 8, 1999, that Jowers was part of a conspiracy to kill King, and that the assassination plot also involved \\"others, including governmental agencies.\\" At a press conference following the verdict, Coretta Scott King stated that \\"there is abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr... the Mafia, local, state and federal government agencies, were deeply involved in the assassination of my husband. The jury also affirmed overwhelming evidence that identified someone else, not James Earl Ray, as the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame.\\" Following statements by Dexter King and other family members, Dexter was subsequently asked by a reporter, \\"there are many people out there who feel that as long as these conspirators remain nameless and faceless there is no true closure, and no justice.\\" He replied: > No, he [Mr. Lloyd Jowers] named the shooter. The shooter was the Memphis > Police Department Officer, Lt. Earl Clark who he named as the killer. Once > again, beyond that you had credible witnesses that named members of a > Special Forces team who didn't have to act because the contract killer > succeeded, with plausible denial, a Mafia contracted killer. The Memphis county prosecutor said on several occasions that Mr. Jowers' claims were without merit and that he was motivated to sell his story for a book or a movie. Ray's lawyer claimed two sisters who worked at Jowers' restaurant would corroborate Jowers' claim, but both recanted their stories. One sister said that Jowers had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story; she in turn corroborated his story in order to get money to pay taxes. In a telephone conversation taped by authorities, Jowers' main witness stated that his story was false. According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"The trial relied heavily on second- and third-hand accounts, and the judge and jurors were often seen dozing off during testimony.\\" John Campbell, an assistant district attorney in Memphis who was part of the criminal trial against James Earl Ray, said: \\"I'm not surprised by the verdict. This case overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented, what other option did the jury have but to accept Mr. Pepper's version?\\" Gerald Posner, an investigative journalist who wrote the book Killing the Dream in which he makes the case that Ray was the killer, said after the verdict: \\"It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.\\" =Justice Department investigation= Prompted by the King family's acceptance of some of the conspiracy theories, United States Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new investigation on August 26, 1998. On June 9, 2000, the United States Department of Justice released a 150-page report rejecting allegations that there was a conspiracy to assassinate King, including the findings of the Memphis civil court jury. The DOJ considered suggestions by the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979 and the district attorney of Shelby County, Tennessee in 1998 that Ray's brothers may have been co-conspirators and stated that they \\"found insufficient evidentiary leads remaining after 30 years to justify further investigation.\\" Death On May 20, 2000, Jowers died of a heart attack at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Union City, Tennessee, five months after the King v. Jowers verdict. He was reported to have suffered from lung cancer at the time of his death. See also * Loyd Jowers trial References External links * King v.

Tula is located in the north of the Central Russian Upland in Central Russia, on the banks of the Upa River, a tributary of the Oka, 193 km south of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, Tula had a population of 501,169, and increase from 481,216 in 2002, making it the 32nd largest city in Russia by population. A primarily industrial city, Tula was settled sometime between the 12th and 14th centuries as a fortress at the border of the Principality of Ryazan. The city was seized by Ivan Bolotnikov, and withstood a four-months siege by the Tsar's army. Historically, Tula was a major centre for the manufacture of armaments. The Demidov family built the first armament factory in Russia in the city, in what would become the Tula Arms Plant, which still operates to this day. Tula is home to the Klokovo air base, Tula State University, Tula Kremlin, and The Tula State Museum of Weapons. Tula has a historical association with the samovar, a metal container used to heat and boil water; the city was a major center of Russian samovar production. Yasnaya Polyana, the former home of the writer Leo Tolstoy, is located 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southwest of Tula. Additionally, Tula is known for its imprinted gingerbread (pryanik), which has been made in Tula since the 17th century. Etymology The name of the city is probably of pre-Russian, probably Baltic, origin.–ï. –ú. –ü–æ—Å–ø–µ–ª–æ–≤. \\"–ì–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –º–∏—Ä–∞\\". –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏, 1998, p. 423: \\"The earliest etymologies derived the place name from Russian dialectal tul√° 'hidden, unreachable place'... The pre- Russian origin of the name of the river and town is no longer doubted [Maiorova 1985].... Since the name of the river Upa is certainly Baltic..., its tributary *Tula [the presumed earlier form of Tulitsa] may also be of Baltic origin, which is supported by a series of parallels in Lithuanian toponymy: the river Tule, the Tulis swamp, the Tulyte field, the meadow Tulejos, the valley Tulija, etc. [Vanagas, 1981]; the meaning of these toponyms is not entirely clear....\\" History Tula was first mentioned in the Nikon Chronicle related to the year 1146. As the chronicle was compiled in the 16th century, the date is disputed. The first confirmed mention of Tula dates to 1382. In the Middle Ages, Tula was a minor fortress at the border of the Principality of Ryazan. As soon as it passed to the Grand Duchy of Moscow, a brick citadel, or kremlin, was constructed in 1514‚Äì1521. It was a key fortress of the Great Abatis Belt and successfully resisted a siege by the Tatars in 1552. In 1607, Ivan Bolotnikov and his supporters seized the citadel and withstood a four-months siege by the Tsar's army. In the 18th century, some parts of the kremlin walls were demolished. Despite its archaic appearance, the five-domed Assumption Cathedral in the kremlin was built as late as 1764. In 1712, Tula was visited by Peter the Great, who commissioned the Demidov blacksmiths to build the first armament factory in Russia. Several decades later, Tula was turned by the Demidovs into the greatest ironworking center of Eastern Europe. The oldest museum in the city, showcasing the history of weapons, was inaugurated by the Demidovs in 1724, and Nicholas- Zaretsky Church in the city houses their family vault. The first factory to produce samovars industrially was also established there in the course of the 18th century. After the Demidovs moved the center of their manufacture to the Urals, Tula continued as a center of heavy industry, particularly in the manufacture of mat√©riel. In the 1890s, Ivan Savelyev, a medical orderly, became the founder of social democracy in Tula and set up a workers' study circle. The city grew rapidly in the early 20th century as a result of arms production during the 1905 Russo-Japanese War and World War I. Tula's factories also manufactured weapons for the Red Army during the Russian Civil War of 1918‚Äì1921. During the World War II of 1941‚Äì1945, the city was important in the production of armaments. Tula became the target of a German offensive to break Soviet resistance in the Moscow area between Friday, October 24 and December 5, 1941. According to Erik Durschmied in The Weather Factor: How Nature has Changed History,Arcade Publishing, 2002. one German general reached the South Western Outskirts of Tula on 29th-30th October 1941. The heavily fortified city held out, however, and Guderian's Second Panzer Army was stopped near Tula. The city secured the southern flank during the Battle of Moscow and the subsequent counter-offensive. Tula was awarded the title Hero City in 1976. It is home to the Klokovo air base and the Tula Arms Plant.

Tula is also renowned for traditional Russian pryanik, cookies made with honey and spices (see Tula pryanik). In the West, Tula is perhaps best known as the center of samovar production: the Russian equivalent of \\"coals to Newcastle\\" is \\"You don't take a samovar to Tula\\". (The saying is falsely ascribed to the writer and playwright Anton Chekhov, whose made a satirical portrait of one of his characters saying \\"Taking your wife to Paris is the same as taking your own samovar to Tula\\".) The most popular tourist attraction in Tula Oblast is Yasnaya Polyana, the home and burial place of the writer Leo Tolstoy. It is situated south-west of the city. It was here that Tolstoy wrote his celebrated novels War and Peace and Anna Karenina. The largest public park in Tula is the P. Belousov Central Park of Culture and Recreation.

Next in number are Protestants and Catholics. Non-Christian organizations that are present include Muslims, Jews, Hare Krishna, Buddhists and Taoists. All Orthodox organizations in Tula and the Tula Oblast are included in the Diocese of Tula and Yefremov. Among the Tula Orthodox churches should be mentioned Saints Cathedral (1776-1800), the oldest church in Tula - Annunciation (1692) and the Assumption Cathedral of the Tula Kremlin (1762-1764). There is also the Shcheglovsky Monastery of Holy Mother of God, built in mid 19th century and consecrated in 1860. In Tula also Old Believers' community services which are performed in the church of St. John Chrysostom. In Tula there is the only Catholic church in the area, the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. Since the 1990s, Tula has several Protestant denominations, the largest church of which is a Baptist church with a prayer house in Tula. Representatives of other Protestant churches in Tula are Seventh-day Adventists, Presbyterians (Church of the Holy Trinity, The Glorious Jesus the Lord, the Good News), Pentecostals (Tula Christian Center, Church of the New Testament) and other evangelical churches (Word of Life, the Vine Gypsy Church). Also the city has a synagogue and the Jewish Community House.

In geometry, a normal is an object such as a line, ray, or vector that is perpendicular to a given object. For example, in two dimensions, the normal line to a curve at a given point is the line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point. A normal vector may have length one (a unit vector) or its length may represent the curvature of the object (a curvature vector); its algebraic sign may indicate sides (interior or exterior). In three dimensions, a surface normal, or simply normal, to a surface at point P is a vector perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at P. The word \\"normal\\" is also used as an adjective: a line normal to a plane, the normal component of a force, the normal vector, etc. The concept of normality generalizes to orthogonality (right angles). The concept has been generalized to differentiable manifolds of arbitrary dimension embedded in a Euclidean space. The normal vector space or normal space of a manifold at point P is the set of vectors which are orthogonal to the tangent space at P. Normal vectors are of special interest in the case of smooth curves and smooth surfaces. The normal is often used in 3D computer graphics (notice the singular, as only one normal will be defined) to determine a surface's orientation toward a light source for flat shading, or the orientation of each of the surface's corners (vertices) to mimic a curved surface with Phong shading. Normal to surfaces in 3D space A curved surface showing the unit normal vectors (blue arrows) to the surface =Calculating a surface normal= For a convex polygon (such as a triangle), a surface normal can be calculated as the vector cross product of two (non- parallel) edges of the polygon. For a plane given by the equation ax+by+cz+d=0, the vector \\\\mathbf n = (a, b, c) is a normal. For a plane whose equation is given in parametric form :\\\\mathbf{r}(s,t) = \\\\mathbf{r}_0 + s \\\\mathbf{p} + t \\\\mathbf{q}, where r0 is a point on the plane and p, q are non- parallel vectors pointing along the plane, a normal to the plane is a vector normal to both p and q, which can be found as the cross product \\\\mathbf{n}=\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{q}. If a (possibly non-flat) surface S in 3-space R3 is parameterized by a system of curvilinear coordinates r(s, t) = (x(s,t), y(s,t), z(s,t)), with s and t real variables, then a normal to S is by definition a normal to a tangent plane, given by the cross product of the partial derivatives :\\\\mathbf{n}={\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\over \\\\partial s}\\\\times {\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\over \\\\partial t}. If a surface S is given implicitly as the set of points (x, y, z) satisfying F(x, y, z)=0, then a normal at a point (x, y, z) on the surface is given by the gradient :\\\\mathbf{n}= abla F(x, y, z). since the gradient at any point is perpendicular to the level set S. For a surface S in R3 given as the graph of a function z=f(x, y), an upward-pointing normal can be found either from the parametrization \\\\mathbf{r}(x,y)=(x,y,f(x,y)), giving: > \\\\mathbf{n}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{r}}{\\\\partial x}\\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\partial > \\\\mathbf{r}}{\\\\partial y} = (1,0,\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}) \\\\times > (0,1,\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y}) = (-\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x}, > -\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y},1); or more simply from its implicit form F(x, y, z) = z-f(x,y) = 0, giving \\\\mathbf{n}= abla F(x, y, z)=(-\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x},-\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y},1). Since a surface does not have a tangent plane at a singular point, it has no well-defined normal at that point: for example, the vertex of a cone. In general, it is possible to define a normal almost everywhere for a surface that is Lipschitz continuous. =Choice of normal= A vector field of normals to a surface The normal to a (hyper)surface is usually scaled to have unit length, but it does not have a unique direction, since its opposite is also a unit normal. For a surface which is the topological boundary of a set in three dimensions, one can distinguish between the inward-pointing normal and outer-pointing normal. For an oriented surface, the normal is usually determined by the right-hand rule or its analog in higher dimensions. If the normal is constructed as the cross product of tangent vectors (as described in the text above), it is a pseudovector. =Transforming normals= :Note: in this section we only use the upper 3x3 matrix, as translation is irrelevant to the calculation When applying a transform to a surface it is often useful to derive normals for the resulting surface from the original normals. Specifically, given a 3x3 transformation matrix M, we can determine the matrix W that transforms a vector n perpendicular to the tangent plane t into a vector n‚Ä≤ perpendicular to the transformed tangent plane M t, by the following logic: Write n‚Ä≤ as W n. We must find W. W\\\\mathbb n \\\\text{ perpendicular to } M\\\\mathbb t :\\\\iff(W \\\\mathbb n) \\\\cdot (M \\\\mathbb t) = 0 :\\\\iff (W \\\\mathbb n)^T (M \\\\mathbb t) = 0 :\\\\iff (\\\\mathbb n^T W^T) (M \\\\mathbb t) = 0 :\\\\iff \\\\mathbb n^T (W^T M) \\\\mathbb t = 0 Clearly choosing W such that W^T M = I, or W = (M^{-1})^T, will satisfy the above equation, giving a W \\\\mathbb n perpendicular to M \\\\mathbb t, or an n‚Ä≤ perpendicular to t‚Ä≤, as required. Therefore, one should use the inverse transpose of the linear transformation when transforming surface normals. The inverse transpose is equal to the original matrix if the matrix is orthonormal, i.e. purely rotational with no scaling or shearing. Hypersurfaces in n-dimensional space For an (n{-}1)-dimensional hyperplane in n-dimensional space Rn given by its parametric representation :\\\\mathbf{r}(t_1,\\\\ldots,t_{n-1}) = \\\\mathbf{p}_0 + t_1 \\\\mathbf{p}_1 + \\\\cdots + t_{n-1}\\\\mathbf{p}_{n{-}1}, where p0 is a point on the hyperplane and pi for i = 1, ..., n-1 are linearly independent vectors pointing along the hyperplane, a normal to the hyperplane is any vector \\\\mathbf n in the null space of the matrix P = [\\\\mathbf{p}_1 \\\\dots \\\\mathbf{p}_{n-1}], meaning P\\\\mathbf n = \\\\mathbf 0. That is, any vector orthogonal to all in-plane vectors is by definition a surface normal. Alternatively, if the hyperplane is defined as the solution set of a single linear equation a_1x_1+\\\\cdots+a_nx_n = c, then the vector \\\\mathbb{n} = (a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n) is a normal. The definition of a normal to a surface in three-dimensional space can be extended to (n-1)-dimensional hypersurfaces in Rn. A hypersurface may be locally defined implicitly as the set of points (x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) satisfying an equation F(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) = 0, where F is a given scalar function. If F is continuously differentiable then the hypersurface is a differentiable manifold in the neighbourhood of the points where the gradient is not zero. At these points a normal vector is given by the gradient: :\\\\mathbb n = abla F(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n) = \\\\left( \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x_1}, \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x_2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x_n} \\\\right)\\\\,. The normal line is the one- dimensional subspace with basis {n}. Varieties defined by implicit equations in n-dimensional space A differential variety defined by implicit equations in the n-dimensional space Rn is the set of the common zeros of a finite set of differentiable functions in n variables : f_1(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n), \\\\ldots, f_k(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n). The Jacobian matrix of the variety is the k√ón matrix whose i-th row is the gradient of fi. By the implicit function theorem, the variety is a manifold in the neighborhood of a point where the Jacobian matrix has rank k. At such a point P, the normal vector space is the vector space generated by the values at P of the gradient vectors of the fi. In other words, a variety is defined as the intersection of k hypersurfaces, and the normal vector space at a point is the vector space generated by the normal vectors of the hypersurfaces at the point. The normal (affine) space at a point P of the variety is the affine subspace passing through P and generated by the normal vector space at P. These definitions may be extended verbatim to the points where the variety is not a manifold. =Example= Let V be the variety defined in the 3-dimensional space by the equations : x\\\\,y=0, \\\\quad z=0\\\\,. This variety is the union of the x-axis and the y-axis. At a point , where , the rows of the Jacobian matrix are and . Thus the normal affine space is the plane of equation . Similarly, if , the normal plane at is the plane of equation . At the point the rows of the Jacobian matrix are and . Thus the normal vector space and the normal affine space have dimension 1 and the normal affine space is the z-axis. Uses *Surface normals are useful in defining surface integrals of vector fields. *Surface normals are commonly used in 3D computer graphics for lighting calculations (see Lambert's cosine law), often adjusted by normal mapping. *Render layers containing surface normal information may be used in Digital compositing to change the apparent lighting of rendered elements. *In computer vision, the shapes of 3D objects are estimated from surface normals using photometric stereo. Normal in geometric optics Diagram of specular reflection The normal ray is the outward-pointing ray perpendicular to the surface of an optical medium at a given point. In reflection of light, the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are respectively the angle between the normal and the incident ray (on the plane of incidence) and the angle between the normal and the reflected ray.

He was also a musician himself, as well as a folklorist, archivist, writer, scholar, political activist, oral historian, and film- maker. Lomax produced recordings, concerts, and radio shows in the US and in England, which played an important role in preserving folk music traditions in both countries, and helped start both the American and British folk revivals of the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. He collected material first with his father, folklorist and collector John A. Lomax, and later alone and with others, Lomax recorded thousands of songs and interviews for the Archive of American Folk Song, of which he was the director, at the Library of Congress on aluminum and acetate discs. After 1942, when Congress cut off the Library of Congress's funding for folk song collecting, Lomax continued to collect independently in Britain, Ireland, the Caribbean, Italy, and Spain, as well as the United States, using the latest recording technology, assembling an enormous collection of American and international culture. In March 2004 the material captured and produced without Library of Congress funding was acquired by the Library, which \\"brings the entire seventy years of Alan Lomax's work together under one roof at the Library of Congress, where it has found a permanent home.\\" With the start of the Cold War, Lomax continued to speak out for a public role for folklore,During the New Deal called \\"applied folklore\\" or \\"functionalism\\" by Benjamin Botkin, see John Alexander Williams, \\"The Professionalization of Folklore Studies: a Comparative Perspective\\", Journal of the Folklore Institute 11: 3 (March 1975); 211‚Äì34. even as academic folklorists turned inward. He devoted much of the latter part of his life to advocating what he called Cultural Equity, which he sought to put on a solid theoretical foundation through to his Cantometrics research (which included a prototype Cantometrics-based educational program, the Global Jukebox). In the 1970s and 1980s Lomax advised the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife Festival and produced a series of films about folk music, American Patchwork, which aired on PBS in 1991. In his late seventies, Lomax completed a long-deferred memoir, The Land Where the Blues Began (1995), linking the birth of the blues to debt peonage, segregation, and forced labor in the American South. Lomax's greatest legacy is in preserving and publishing recordings of musicians in many folk and blues traditions around the US and Europe. Among the artists Lomax is credited with discovering and bringing to a wider audience include blues guitarist Robert Johnson, protest singer Woody Guthrie, folk artist Pete Seeger, country musician Burl Ives, and country blues singer Lead Belly, among many others. \\"Alan scraped by the whole time, and left with no money,\\" said Don Fleming, director of Lomax's Association for Culture Equity. \\"He did it out of the passion he had for it, and found ways to fund projects that were closest to his heart.\\" Biography =Early life= Lomax was born in Austin, Texas, in 1915, the third of four children born to Bess Brown and pioneering folklorist and author John A. Lomax. The elder Lomax, a former professor of English at Texas A&M; and a celebrated authority on Texas folklore and cowboy songs, had worked as an administrator, and later Secretary of the Alumni Society, of the University of Texas. Due to childhood asthma, chronic ear infections, and generally frail health, Lomax had mostly been home schooled in elementary school. In Dallas, he entered the Terrill School for Boys (a tiny prep school that later became St. Mark's School of Texas). Lomax excelled at Terrill and then transferred to the Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Connecticut for a year, graduating eighth in his class at age 15 in 1930.John Szwed, Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World (New York: Viking, 2010), p. 20. Owing to his mother's declining health, however, rather than going to Harvard as his father had wished, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin. A roommate, future anthropologist Walter Goldschmidt, recalled Lomax as \\"frighteningly smart, probably classifiable as a genius\\", though Goldschmidt remembers Lomax exploding one night while studying: \\"Damn it! The hardest thing I've had to learn is that I'm not a genius.\\"Szwed (2010), p. 21. At the University of Texas Lomax read Nietzsche and developed an interest in philosophy. He joined and wrote a few columns for the school paper, The Daily Texan but resigned when it refused to publish an editorial he had written on birth control. At this time he also he began collecting \\"race\\" records and taking his dates to black-owned night clubs, at the risk of expulsion. During the spring term his mother died, and his youngest sister Bess, age 10, was sent to live with an aunt. Although the Great Depression was rapidly causing his family's resources to plummet, Harvard came up with enough financial aid for the 16-year-old Lomax to spend his second year there. He enrolled in philosophy and physics and also pursued a long-distance informal reading course in Plato and the Pre-Socratics with University of Texas professor Albert P. Brogan.Szwed (2010), p. 22. He also became involved in radical politics and came down with pneumonia. His grades suffered, diminishing his financial aid prospects.Szwed (2010), p. 24. Lomax, now 17, therefore took a break from studying to join his father's folk song collecting field trips for the Library of Congress, co-authoring American Ballads and Folk Songs (1934) and Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly (1936). His first field collecting without his father was done with Zora Neale Hurston and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle in the summer of 1935. He returned to the University of Texas that fall and was awarded a BA in Philosophy, summa cum laude, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa in May 1936.Szwed (2010), p. 92. Lack of money prevented him from immediately attending graduate school at the University of Chicago, as he desired, but he would later correspond with and pursue graduate studies with Melville J. Herskovits at Columbia University and with Ray Birdwhistell at the University of Pennsylvania. Alan Lomax married Elizabeth Harold Goodman, then a student at the University of Texas, in February 1937.Szwed (2010), p. 91. They were married for 12 years and had a daughter, Anne (later known as Anna). Elizabeth assisted him in recording in Haiti, Alabama, Appalachia, and Mississippi. Elizabeth also wrote radio scripts of folk operas featuring American music that were broadcast over the BBC Home Service as part of the war effort. During the 1950s, after she and Lomax divorced, she conducted lengthy interviews for Lomax with folk music personalities, including Vera Ward Hall and the Reverend Gary Davis. Lomax also did important field work with Elizabeth Barnicle and Zora Neale Hurston in Florida and the Bahamas (1935); with John Wesley Work III and Lewis Jones in Mississippi (1941 and 42); with folksingers Robin Roberts and Jean Ritchie in Ireland (1950); with his second wife Antoinette Marchand in the Caribbean (1961); with Shirley Collins in Great Britain and the Southeastern US (1959); with Joan Halifax in Morocco; and with his daughter. All those who assisted and worked with him were accurately credited on the resultant Library of Congress and other recordings, as well as in his many books, films, and publications. =Assistant in Charge and Commercial Records and Radio Broadcasts= From 1937 to 1942, Lomax was Assistant in Charge of the Archive of Folk Song of the Library of Congress to which he and his father and numerous collaborators contributed more than ten thousand field recordings. A pioneering oral historian, Lomax recorded substantial interviews with many folk and jazz musicians, including Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Jelly Roll Morton and other jazz pioneers, and Big Bill Broonzy. On one of his trips in 1941, he went to Clarksdale, Mississippi, hoping to record the music of Robert Johnson. When he arrived, he was told by locals that Johnson had died but that another local man, Muddy Waters, might be willing to record his music for Lomax. Using recording equipment that filled the trunk of his car, Lomax recorded Waters' music; it is said that hearing Lomax's recording was the motivation that Waters needed to leave his farm job in Mississippi to pursue a career as a blues musician, first in Memphis and later in Chicago. As part of this work, Lomax traveled through Michigan and Wisconsin in 1938 to record and document the traditional music of that region. Over four hundred recordings from this collection are now available at the Library of Congress. \\"He traveled in a 1935 Plymouth sedan, toting a Presto instantaneous disc recorder and a movie camera. And when he returned nearly three months later, having driven thousands of miles on barely paved roads, it was with a cache of 250 discs and 8 reels of film, documents of the incredible range of ethnic diversity, expressive traditions, and occupational folklife in Michigan.\\" In late 1939, Lomax hosted two series on CBS's nationally broadcast American School of the Air, called American Folk Song and Wellsprings of Music, both music appreciation courses that aired daily in the schools and were supposed to highlight links between American folk and classical orchestral music. As host, Lomax sang and presented other performers, including Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, Josh White, and the Golden Gate Quartet. The individual programs reached ten million students in 200,000 U.S. classrooms and were also broadcast in Canada, Hawaii, and Alaska, but both Lomax and his father felt that the concept of the shows, which portrayed folk music as mere raw material for orchestral music, was deeply flawed and failed to do justice to vernacular culture. In 1940 under Lomax's supervision, RCA made two groundbreaking suites of commercial folk music recordings: Woody Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads and Lead Belly's The Midnight Special and Other Southern Prison Songs.Colin Scott and David Evans, liner Notes to Poor Man's Heaven (2003) CD in RCA Bluebird series When the Sun Goes Down, The Secret History of Rock and Roll, ASIN: B000092Q48. Midnight Special and Other Prison Songs was reissued complete on Bluebird in 2003. Though they did not sell especially well when released, Lomax's biographer, John Szwed calls these \\"some of the first concept albums.\\"Szwed (2010), p. 163. In 1940, Lomax and his close friend Nicholas Ray went on to write and produce a fifteen-minute program, Back Where I Came From, which aired three nights a week on CBS and featured folk tales, proverbs, prose, and sermons, as well as songs, organized thematically. Its racially integrated cast included Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Josh White, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee. In February 1941, Lomax spoke and gave a demonstration of his program along with talks by Nelson A. Rockefeller from the Pan American Union, and the president of the American Museum of Natural History, at a global conference in Mexico of a thousand broadcasters CBS had sponsored to launch its worldwide programming initiative. Mrs. Roosevelt invited Lomax to Hyde Park.Szwed (2010), p. 167. Despite its success and high visibility, Back Where I Come From never picked up a commercial sponsor. The show ran for only twenty-one weeks before it was suddenly canceled in February 1941.Alan put the blame on CBS president William Paley, who he claimed 'hated all that hillbilly music on his network'\\" (Szwed [2010], p. 167). On hearing the news, Woody Guthrie wrote Lomax from California, \\"Too honest again, I suppose? Maybe not purty enough. O well, this country's a getting to where it can't hear its own voice. Someday the deal will change.\\"Quoted in Ronald D. Cohen, The Rainbow Quest (University of Massachusetts Press, 2002), p. 25. Lomax himself wrote that in all his work he had tried to capture \\"the seemingly incoherent diversity of American folk song as an expression of its democratic, inter-racial, international character, as a function of its inchoate and turbulent many-sided development.\\"Alan Lomax \\"Songs of the American Folk\\", Modern Music 18 (Jan.-Feb. 1941), quoted in Cohen (2002), p. 25. On December 8, 1941, as \\"Assistant in Charge at the Library of Congress\\", he sent telegrams to fieldworkers in ten different localities across the United States, asking them to collect reactions of ordinary Americans to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war by the United States. A second series of interviews, called \\"Dear Mr. President\\", was recorded in January and February 1942. While serving in the army in World War II, Lomax produced and hosted numerous radio programs in connection with the war effort. The 1944 \\"ballad opera\\", The Martins and the Coys, broadcast in Britain (but not the USA) by the BBC, featuring Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Will Geer, Sonny Terry, Pete Seeger, and Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, among others, was released on Rounder Records in 2000. In the late 1940s, Lomax produced a series of commercial folk music albums for Decca Records and organized a series of concerts at New York's Town Hall and Carnegie Hall, featuring blues, calypso, and flamenco music. He also hosted a radio show, Your Ballad Man, in 1949 that was broadcast nationwide on the Mutual Radio Network and featured a highly eclectic program, from gamelan music, to Django Reinhardt, to klezmer music, to Sidney Bechet and Wild Bill Davison, to jazzy pop songs by Maxine Sullivan and Jo Stafford, to readings of the poetry of Carl Sandburg, to hillbilly music with electric guitars, to Finnish brass bands ‚Äì to name a few.See Matthew Barton and Andrew L. Kaye, in Ronald D. Cohen (ed), Alan Lomax Selected Writings, (New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 98‚Äì99. He also was a key participant in the V. D. Radio Project in 1949, creating a number of \\"ballad dramas\\" featuring country and gospel superstars, including Roy Acuff, Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe (among others), that aimed to convince men and women suffering from syphilis to seek treatment. =Move to Europe and later life= In December 1949 a newspaper printed a story, \\"Red Convictions Scare 'Travelers'\\", that mentioned a dinner given by the Civil Rights Association to honor five lawyers who had defended people accused of being Communists. The article mentioned Alan Lomax as one of the sponsors of the dinner, along with C. B. Baldwin, campaign manager for Henry A. Wallace in 1948; music critic Olin Downes of The New York Times; and W. E. B. Du Bois, all of whom it accused of being members of Communist front groups.Szwed, (2010), pp. 250‚Äì51. The following June, Red Channels, a pamphlet edited by former F.B.I. agents which became the basis for the entertainment industry blacklist of the 1950s, listed Lomax as an artist or broadcast journalist sympathetic to Communism. (Others listed included Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, Yip Harburg, Lena Horne, Langston Hughes, Burl Ives, Dorothy Parker, Pete Seeger, and Josh White.) That summer, Congress was debating the McCarran Act, which would require the registration and fingerprinting of all \\"subversives\\" in the United States, restrictions of their right to travel, and detention in case of \\"emergencies,\\"Congress passed the Act in Sept. 1950 over the veto of President Truman, who called the it \\"the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798,\\" a \\"mockery of the Bill of Rights\\", and a \\"long step toward totalitarianism.\\" See Harry S. Truman, \\"Veto of the Internal Security Bill\\" , Harry S. Truman Library website while the House Un-American Activities Committee was broadening its hearings. Feeling sure that the Act would pass and realizing that his career in broadcasting was in jeopardy, Lomax, who was newly divorced and already had an agreement with Goddard Lieberson of Columbia Records to record in Europe,Szwed (2010), p. 248. hastened to renew his passport, cancel his speaking engagements, and plan for his departure, telling his agent he hoped to return in January \\"if things cleared up.\\" He set sail on September 24, 1950, on board the steamer . Sure enough, in October, FBI agents were interviewing Lomax's friends and acquaintances. Lomax never told his family exactly why he went to Europe, only that he was developing a library of world folk music for Columbia. Nor would he ever allow anyone to say he was forced to leave. In a letter to the editor of a British newspaper, Lomax took a writer to task for describing him as a \\"victim of witch-hunting,\\" insisting that he was in the UK only to work on his Columbia Project.Szwed (2010) p. 251. Lomax spent the 1950s based in London, from where he edited the 18-volume Columbia World Library of Folk and Primitive Music, an anthology issued on newly invented LP records. He spent seven months in Spain, where, in addition to recording three thousand items from most of the regions of Spain, he made copious notes and took hundreds of photos of \\"not only singers and musicians but anything that interested him ‚Äì empty streets, old buildings, and country roads\\", bringing to these photos, \\"a concern for form and composition that went beyond the ethnographic to the artistic\\".Szwed (2010), p. 274. He drew a parallel between photography and field recording: > Recording folk songs works like a candid cameraman. I hold the mike, use my > hand for shading volume. It's a big problem in Spain because there is so > much emotional excitement, noise all around. Empathy is most important in > field work. It's necessary to put your hand on the artist while he sings. > They have to react to you. Even if they're mad at you, it's better than > nothing. When Columbia Records producer George Avakian gave jazz arranger Gil Evans a copy of the Spanish World Library LP, Miles Davis and Evans were \\"struck by the beauty of pieces such as the 'Saeta', recorded in Seville, and a panpiper's tune ('Alborada de Vigo') from Galicia, and worked them into the 1960 album, Sketches of Spain.\\"Szwed (2010), p. 275. For the Scottish, English, and Irish volumes, he worked with the BBC and folklorists Peter Douglas Kennedy, Scots poet Hamish Henderson, and with the Irish folklorist S√©amus Ennis, recording among others, Margaret Barry and the songs in Irish of Elizabeth Cronin; Scots ballad singer Jeannie Robertson; and Harry Cox of Norfolk, England, and interviewing some of these performers at length about their lives. In 1953 a young David Attenborough commissioned Lomax to host six 20-minute episodes of a BBC TV series, The Song Hunter, which featured performances by a wide range of traditional musicians from all over Britain and Ireland, as well as Lomax himself. In 1957 Lomax hosted a folk music show on BBC's Home Service called 'A Ballad Hunter' and organized a skiffle group, Alan Lomax and the Ramblers (who included Ewan MacColl, Peggy Seeger, and Shirley Collins, among others), which appeared on British television. His ballad opera, Big Rock Candy Mountain, premiered December 1955 at Joan Littlewood's Theater Workshop and featured Ramblin' Jack Elliot. In Scotland, Lomax is credited with being an inspiration for the School of Scottish Studies, founded in 1951, the year of his first visit there. Lomax and Diego Carpitella's survey of Italian folk music for the Columbia World Library, conducted in 1953 and 1954, with the cooperation of the BBC and the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, helped capture a snapshot of a multitude of important traditional folk styles shortly before they disappeared. The pair amassed one of the most representative folk song collections of any culture. From Lomax's Spanish and Italian recordings emerged one of the first theories explaining the types of folk singing that predominate in particular areas, a theory that incorporates work style, the environment, and the degrees of social and sexual freedom. Return to the United States Upon his return to New York in 1959, Lomax produced a concert, Folksong '59, in Carnegie Hall, featuring Arkansas singer Jimmy Driftwood; the Selah Jubilee Singers and Drexel Singers (gospel groups); Muddy Waters and Memphis Slim (blues); Earl Taylor and the Stoney Mountain Boys (bluegrass); Pete Seeger, Mike Seeger (urban folk revival); and The Cadillacs (a rock and roll group). The occasion marked the first time rock and roll and bluegrass were performed on the Carnegie Hall Stage. \\"The time has come for Americans not to be ashamed of what we go for, musically, from primitive ballads to rock 'n' roll songs\\", Lomax told the audience. According to Izzy Young, the audience booed when he told them to lay down their prejudices and listen to rock 'n' roll. In Young's opinion, \\"Lomax put on what is probably the turning point in American folk music . . . . At that concert, the point he was trying to make was that Negro and white music were mixing, and rock and roll was that thing.\\"Quoted in Ronald D. Cohen's Rainbow Quest, University of Massachusetts Press, 2002, p. 140 Alan Lomax had met 20-year-old English folk singer Shirley Collins while living in London. The two were romantically involved and lived together for some years. When Lomax obtained a contract from Atlantic Records to re-record some of the American musicians first recorded in the 1940s, using improved equipment, Collins accompanied him. Their folk song collecting trip to the Southern states, known colloquially as the Southern Journey, lasted from July to November 1959 and resulted in many hours of recordings, featuring performers such as Almeda Riddle, Hobart Smith, Wade Ward, Charlie Higgins and Bessie Jones and culminated in the discovery of Fred McDowell. Recordings from this trip were issued under the title Sounds of the South and some were also featured in the Coen brothers' 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Lomax wished to marry Collins but when the recording trip was over, she returned to England and married Austin John Marshall. In an interview in The Guardian newspaper, Collins expressed irritation that Alan Lomax's 1993 account of the journey, The Land Where The Blues Began, barely mentioned her. \\"All it said was, 'Shirley Collins was along for the trip'. It made me hopping mad. I wasn't just 'along for the trip'. I was part of the recording process, I made notes, I drafted contracts, I was involved in every part\\". Collins addressed the perceived omission in her memoir, America Over the Water, published in 2004.Collins, Shirley, America Over The Water, SAF Publishing, 2004, pp.154‚Äì160Collins described her arrival in America 1959 in an interview with Johan Kugelberg: () Lomax married Antoinette Marchand on August 26, 1961. They separated the following year and were divorced in 1967.Szwed (2010), p. 344. In 1962, Lomax and singer and Civil Rights Activist Guy Carawan, music director at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, produced the album, Freedom in the Air: Albany Georgia, 1961‚Äì62, on Vanguard Records for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Lomax was a consultant to Carl Sagan for the Voyager Golden Record sent into space on the 1977 Voyager Spacecraft to represent the music of the earth. Music he helped choose included the blues, jazz, and rock 'n' roll of Blind Willie Johnson, Louis Armstrong, and Chuck Berry; Andean panpipes and Navajo chants; Azerbaijani mugham performed by two balaban players,Carl Sagan, Murmurs of Earth: The Voyager Interstellar Record (New York: Random House, 1978), pp. 204‚Äì205. a Sicilian sulfur miner's lament; polyphonic vocal music from the Mbuti Pygmies of Zaire, and the Georgians of the Caucasus; and a shepherdess song from Bulgaria by Valya Balkanska; in addition to Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, and more. Sagan later wrote that it was Lomax \\"who was a persistent and vigorous advocate for including ethnic music even at the expense of Western classical music. He brought pieces so compelling and beautiful that we gave in to his suggestions more often than I would have thought possible. There was, for example, no room for Debussy among our selections, because Azerbaijanis play bagpipe-sounding instruments [balaban] and Peruvians play panpipes and such exquisite pieces had been recorded by ethnomusicologists known to Lomax.\\"Carl Sagan, Murmurs of Earth: The Voyager Interstellar Record (New York: Random House, 1978), p. 16. Alan Lomax died in Safety Harbor, Florida on July 19, 2002 at the age of 87. Cultural equity As a member of the Popular Front and People's Songs in the 1940s, Alan Lomax promoted what was then known as \\"One World\\" and today is called multiculturalism.Ironically, perhaps, the phrase originated in an article , later a best-selling 1943 book by Republican candidate Wendell Willkie. In the late forties he produced a series of concerts at Town Hall and Carnegie Hall that presented flamenco guitar and calypso, along with country blues, Appalachian music, Andean music, and jazz. His radio shows of the 1940s and 1950s explored musics of all the world's peoples. Lomax recognized that folklore (like all forms of creativity) occurs at the local and not the national level and flourishes not in isolation but in fruitful interplay with other cultures. He was dismayed that mass communications appeared to be crushing local cultural expressions and languages. In 1950 he echoed anthropologist Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski (1884‚Äì1942), who believed the role of the ethnologist should be that of advocate for primitive man (as indigenous people were then called), when he urged folklorists to similarly advocate for the folk. Some, such as Richard Dorson, objected that scholars shouldn't act as cultural arbiters, but Lomax believed it would be unethical to stand idly by as the magnificent variety of the world's cultures and languages was \\"grayed out\\" by centralized commercial entertainment and educational systems. Although he acknowledged potential problems with intervention, he urged that folklorists with their special training actively assist communities in safeguarding and revitalizing their own local traditions. Similar ideas had been put into practice by Benjamin Botkin, Harold W. Thompson, and Louis C. Jones, who believed that folklore studied by folklorists should be returned to its home communities to enable it to thrive anew. They have been realized in the annual (since 1967) Smithsonian Folk Festival on the Mall in Washington, D.C. (for which Lomax served as a consultant), in national and regional initiatives by public folklorists and local activists in helping communities gain recognition for their oral traditions and lifeways both in their home communities and in the world at large; and in the National Heritage Awards, concerts, and fellowships given by the NEA and various State governments to master folk and traditional artists. In 1983, Lomax founded The Association for Cultural Equity (ACE). It is housed at the Fine Arts Campus of Hunter College in New York City and is the custodian of the Alan Lomax Archive. The Association's mission is to \\"facilitate cultural equity\\" and practice \\"cultural feedback\\" and \\"preserve, publish, repatriate and freely disseminate\\" its collections. Though Alan Lomax's appeals to anthropology conferences and repeated letters to UNESCO fell on deaf ears, the modern world seems to have caught up to his vision. In an article first published in the 2009 Louisiana Folklore Miscellany, Barry Jean Ancelet, folklorist and chair of the Modern Languages Department at University of Louisiana at Lafayette, wrote: In 2001, in the wake of the attacks in New York and Washington of September 11, UNESCO's Universal Declaration of Cultural Diversity declared the safeguarding of languages and intangible culture on a par with protection of individual human rights and as essential for human survival as biodiversity is for nature,On the vital connection between biological diversity and cultural diversity, see Maywa Montenegro and Terry Glavin, \\"Scientists Offer New Insight into What to Protect of the World's Rapidly Vanishing Languages, Cultures, and Species\\" in In Defense of Difference: Seed Magazine (Oct. 2008): \\"Last October, when United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) released its Global Outlook 4 report, reiterating the scientific consensus that, ultimately, humans are to blame for current global extinctions, UNEP for the first time made an explicit connection between the ongoing collapse of biological diversity and the rapid, global-scale withering of cultural and linguistic diversity: 'Global social and economic change is driving the loss of biodiversity and disrupting local ways of life by promoting cultural assimilation and homogenization,' the report noted. 'Cultural change, such as loss of cultural and spiritual values, languages, and traditional knowledge and practices, is a driver that can cause increasing pressures on biodiversity...In turn, these pressures impact human well-being'\\". ideas remarkably similar to those forcefully articulated by Alan Lomax many years before. FBI investigations From 1942 to 1979 Lomax was repeatedly investigated and interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), although nothing incriminating was ever discovered and the investigation was eventually abandoned. Scholar and jazz pianist Ted Gioia uncovered and published extracts from Alan Lomax's 800-page FBI files.Ted Gioia,\\"The Red-rumor blues\\", Los Angeles Times, April 23, 2006. The investigation appears to have started when an anonymous informant reported overhearing Lomax's father telling guests in 1941 about what he considered his son's communist sympathies. Looking for leads, the FBI seized on the fact that, at the age of 17 in 1932 while attending Harvard for a year, Lomax had been arrested in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a political demonstration. In 1942 the FBI sent agents to interview students at Harvard's freshman dormitory about Lomax's participation in a demonstration that had occurred at Harvard ten years earlier in support of the immigration rights of one Edith Berkman, a Jewish woman, dubbed the \\"red flame\\" for her labor organizing activities among the textile workers of Lawrence, Massachusetts, and threatened with deportation as an alleged \\"Communist agitator\\".See the Ann Burlak papers at the Archives of Smith College. Miss Berkman was defended by a lawyer from the International Labor Defense, the same organization that later defended the Scottsboro Boys. See \\"Edith Berkman Will Fight Deportation\\", Lewiston Daily Sun clip for July 29, 1931. Lomax had been charged with disturbing the peace and fined $25. Berkman, however, had been cleared of all accusations against her and was not deported. Nor had Lomax's Harvard academic record been affected in any way by his activities in her defense. Nevertheless, the bureau continued trying vainly to show that in 1932 Lomax had either distributed Communist literature or made public speeches in support of the Communist Party. According to Ted Gioia: > Lomax must have felt it necessary to address the suspicions. He gave a sworn > statement to an FBI agent on April 3, 1942, denying both of these charges. > He also explained his arrest while at Harvard as the result of police > overreaction. He was, he claimed, 15 at the time ‚Äì he was actually 17 and a > college student ‚Äì and he said he had intended to participate in a peaceful > demonstration. Lomax said he and his colleagues agreed to stop their protest > when police asked them to, but that he was grabbed by a couple of policemen > as he was walking away. \\"That is pretty much the story there, except that it > distressed my father very, very much\\", Lomax told the FBI. \\"I had to defend > my righteous position, and he couldn't understand me and I couldn't > understand him. It has made a lot of unhappiness for the two of us because > he loved Harvard and wanted me to be a great success there.\\" Lomax > transferred to the University of Texas the following year. Lomax left Harvard, after having spent his sophomore year there, to join John A. Lomax and John Lomax, Jr. in collecting folk songs for the Library of Congress and to assist his father in writing his books. In withdrawing him (in addition to not being able to afford the tuition), the elder Lomax had probably wanted to separate his son from new political associates that he considered undesirable. But Alan had also not been happy there and probably also wanted to be nearer his bereaved father and young sister, Bess, and to return to the close friends he had made during his first year at the University of Texas. In June 1942 the FBI approached the Librarian of Congress, Archibald McLeish, in an attempt to have Lomax fired as Assistant in Charge of the Library's Archive of American Folk Song. At the time, Lomax was preparing for a field trip to the Mississippi Delta on behalf of the Library, where he would make landmark recordings of Muddy Waters, Son House, and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards, among others. McLeish wrote to Hoover, defending Lomax: \\"I have studied the findings of these reports very carefully. I do not find positive evidence that Mr. Lomax has been engaged in subversive activities and I am therefore taking no disciplinary action toward him.\\" Nevertheless, according to Gioia: > Yet what the probe failed to find in terms of prosecutable evidence, it made > up for in speculation about his character. An FBI report dated July 23, > 1943, describes Lomax as possessing \\"an erratic, artistic temperament\\" and a > \\"bohemian attitude.\\" It says: \\"He has a tendency to neglect his work over a > period of time and then just before a deadline he produces excellent > results.\\" The file quotes one informant who said that \\"Lomax was a very > peculiar individual, that he seemed to be very absent-minded and that he > paid practically no attention to his personal appearance.\\" This same source > adds that he suspected Lomax's peculiarity and poor grooming habits came > from associating with the \\"hillbillies who provided him with folk tunes. Lomax, who was a founding member of People's Songs, was in charge of campaign music for Henry A. Wallace's 1948 Presidential run on the Progressive Party ticket on a platform opposing the arms race and supporting civil rights for Jews and African Americans. Subsequently, Lomax was one of the performers listed in the publication Red Channels as a possible Communist sympathizer and was consequently blacklisted from working in US entertainment industries. A 2007 BBC news article revealed that in the early 1950s, the British MI5 placed Alan Lomax under surveillance as a suspected Communist. Its report concluded that although Lomax undoubtedly held \\"left wing\\" views, there was no evidence he was a Communist. Released September 4, 2007 (File ref KV 2/2701), a summary of his MI5 file reads as follows: > Noted American folk music archivist and collector Alan Lomax first attracted > the attention of the Security Service when it was noted that he had made > contact with the Romanian press attach√© in London while he was working on a > series of folk music broadcasts for the BBC in 1952. Correspondence ensued > with the American authorities as to Lomax' suspected membership of the > Communist Party, though no positive proof is found on this file. The Service > took the view that Lomax' work compiling his collections of world folk music > gave him a legitimate reason to contact the attach√©, and that while his > views (as demonstrated by his choice of songs and singers) were undoubtedly > left wing, there was no need for any specific action against him. > The file contains a partial record of Lomax' movements, contacts and > activities while in Britain, and includes for example a police report of the > \\"Songs of the Iron Road\\" concert at St Pancras in December 1953. His > association with [blacklisted American] film director Joseph Losey is also > mentioned (serial 30a). The FBI again investigated Lomax in 1956 and sent a 68-page report to the CIA and the Attorney General's office. However, William Tompkins, assistant attorney general, wrote to Hoover that the investigation had failed to disclose sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution or the suspension of Lomax's passport. Then, as late as 1979, an FBI report suggested that Lomax had recently impersonated an FBI agent. The report appears to have been based on mistaken identity. The person who reported the incident to the FBI said that the man in question was around 43, about 5 feet 9 inches and 190 pounds. The FBI file notes that Lomax stood tall, weighed 240 pounds and was 64 at the time: > Lomax resisted the FBI's attempts to interview him about the impersonation > charges, but he finally met with agents at his home in November 1979. He > denied that he'd been involved in the matter but did note that he'd been in > New Hampshire in July 1979, visiting a film editor about a documentary. The > FBI's report concluded that \\"Lomax made no secret of the fact that he > disliked the FBI and disliked being interviewed by the FBI. Lomax was > extremely nervous throughout the interview. The FBI investigation was concluded the following year, shortly after Lomax's 65th birthday. Awards Alan Lomax received the National Medal of Arts from President Ronald Reagan in 1986; a Library of Congress Living Legend Award in 2000; and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Philosophy from Tulane University in 2001. He won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Award in 1993 for his book The Land Where the Blues Began, connecting the story of the origins of blues music with the prevalence of forced labor in the pre-World War II South (especially on the Mississippi levees). Lomax also received a posthumous Grammy Trustees Award for his lifetime achievements in 2003. Jelly Roll Morton: The Complete Library of Congress Recordings by Alan Lomax (Rounder Records, 8 CDs boxed set) won in two categories at the 48th annual Grammy Awards ceremony held on February 8, 2006 Alan Lomax in Haiti: Recordings For The Library Of Congress, 1936‚Äì1937, issued by Harte Records and made with the support and major funding from Kimberley Green and the Green foundation, and featuring 10 CDs of recorded music and film footage (shot by Elizabeth Lomax, then nineteen), a bound book of Lomax's selected letters and field journals, and notes by musicologist Gage Averill, was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2011. World music and digital legacy Brian Eno wrote of Lomax's later recording career in his notes to accompany an anthology of Lomax's world recordings: > [He later] turned his intelligent attentions to music from many other parts > of the world, securing for them a dignity and status they had not previously > been accorded. The \\"World Music\\" phenomenon arose partly from those efforts, > as did his great book, Folk Song Style and Culture. I believe this is one of > the most important books ever written about music, in my all time top ten. > It is one of the very rare attempts to put cultural criticism onto a > serious, comprehensible, and rational footing by someone who had the > experience and breadth of vision to be able to do it.Brian Eno, in liner > notes to the Alan Lomax Collection Sampler (Rounder Records, 1997) In January 2012, the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, with the Association for Cultural Equity, announced that they would release Lomax's vast archive in digital form. Lomax spent the last 20 years of his life working on an interactive multimedia educational computer project he called the Global Jukebox, which included 5,000 hours of sound recordings, 400,000 feet of film, 3,000 videotapes, and 5,000 photographs.\\"The Premiere of the Global Jukebox\\". Radio interview with Don Fleming by John Hockenberry on PRI's The Takeaway. By February 2012, 17,000 music tracks from his archived collection were expected to be made available for free streaming, and later some of that music may be for sale as CDs or digital downloads. As of March 2012 this has been accomplished. Approximately 17,400 of Lomax's recordings from 1946 and later have been made available free online. This is material from Alan Lomax's independent archive, begun in 1946, which has been digitized and offered by the Association for Cultural Equity.

Dov Ber ben Avraham of Mezeritch (; died December 1772 OS), also known as the Maggid of Mezritch, was a disciple of Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidic Judaism, and was chosen as his successor to lead the early movement. Dov Ber is regarded as the first systematic exponent of the mystical philosophy underlying the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, and through his teaching and leadership, the main architect of the movement.see Kaufmann Kohler & Louis Ginzberg. \\"Baer (Dov) of Meseritz\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, retrieved May 20, 2006 He established his base in Mezhirichi (in Volhynia), which moved the centre of Hasidism from the Baal Shem Tov's Medzhybizh (in Podolia), where he focused his attention on raising a close circle of great disciples to spread the movement. After his death, avoiding the unified leadership of the first two generations, this third generation of leadership took their different interpretations and disseminated across appointed regions of Eastern Europe. Under the inspiration of their teacher, this rapidly spread Hasidism beyond Ukraine, to Poland, Galicia and Russia. His teachings appear in Magid Devarav L'Yaakov, Or Torah, Likutim Yekarim, Or Ha'emet, Kitvei Kodesh, Shemuah Tovah, and in the works authored by his disciples. His inner circle of disciples, known as the Chevraia Kadisha (\\"Holy Brotherhood\\"), included Rabbis Avraham HaMalach (his son), Nachum of Czernobyl, Elimelech of Lizhensk, Zusha of Hanipol, Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, Boruch of Medzhybizh, Aharon (HaGadol) of Karlin, Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, Shmuel Shmelke of Nikolsburg and Shneur Zalman of Liadi. Name The most common transliterations are Dov-Ber, Dov Baer and DovBer; rarely used forms are Dob Ber or Dobh Ber, which often depend on the region in Eastern Europe where Jews resided and hence the influence of the local Yiddish dialects. The name ◊ì◊ï◊ë- ◊ë◊¢◊® Dov-Ber literally means \\"bear-bear\\", traceable back to the Hebrew word ◊ì◊ë dov \\"bear\\" and the Yiddish word B√§r \\"bear\\".Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew. Palgrave Macmillan. / It is thus an example of a bilingual tautological name. Dov Ber of Mezeritch was known as the Maggid ‚Äî \\"Preacher\\" or literally \\"Sayer,\\" one who preaches and admonishes to go in God's ways ‚Äî of Mezritsh (The German form Meseritz is sometimes used instead of Mezeritch). Towards the end of his life he was also known as the Maggid of Rivne, the town where he was buried. Biography Dov Ber was born in Lokachi, Volhynia in 1710, according to the Jewish Encyclopedia, though his year of birth is unknown and some sources place it around 1700.\\"The Journeyman/Ascetic\\", Chabad.org, retrieved May 20, 2006 Little is known about him before he became a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov. A Hasidic legend states that, when he was five years old, his family home burst into flames. On hearing his mother weeping, he asked: \\"Mother, do we have to be so unhappy because we have lost a house?\\" She replied that she was mourning the family tree, which was destroyed, and is traced to King David by way of Rabbi Yohanan, the sandal-maker and master in the Talmud. The boy replied: \\"And what does that matter! I shall get you a new family tree which begins with me!\\"Martin Buber. Tales of the Hasidim, Schocken 1947; this edition 1991, p. 98-99. When he was young, he reportedly lived in great poverty with his wife. One legend relates that when a child was born, they had no money to pay the midwife. His wife complained and the Maggid went outside to \\"curse\\" Israel. He went outside and said: \\"O children of Israel, may abundant blessings come upon you!\\" When his wife complained a second time, he went outside again and cried: \\"Let all happiness come to the children of Israel ‚Äî but they shall give their money to thorn bushes and stones!\\" The baby was too weak to cry, and the Maggid sighed rather than \\"cursing\\". Immediately the answer came, and a voice said: \\"You have lost your share in the coming world.\\" The Maggid replied: \\"Well, then, the reward has been done away with. Now I can begin to serve in good earnest.\\" He is buried in Hannopil, beside Zusha of Hanipol. Visit to Baal Shem Tov Dov Ber later became an admirer of Isaac Luria's system of Kabbalah, which was becoming popular at that time, and was aware of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, whose writings, then only in manuscript, were well known among the Polish mystics of the period. Dov Ber followed the Lurian school, living the life of an ascetic, fasting a great deal, praying intensely, and living in poverty. He is reported to have become a cripple as a result of poor nourishment. One account has it that on account of his poor health he was persuaded to seek out the Baal Shem Tov for a cure. He arrived at the Baal Shem Tov's house, expecting to hear expositions of profound mysteries, but instead was told stories of the latter's everyday life. Hearing only similar stories at each subsequent visit, Dov Ber decided to return home. Just as he was about to leave, he was summoned again to the Baal Shem Tov's house. The Baal Shem Tov opened an \\"Eitz Chaim\\" of Rabbi Chaim Vital (Rabbi Isaac Luria's chief disciple), and asked him to explain a certain passage. Dov Ber did so to the best of his ability, but the Baal Shem Tov declared that he had not understood the real meaning of the passage. Dov Ber reviewed it once more and insisted that his interpretation was correct. The Baal Shem Tov then proceeded to explain the passage himself. Legend has it that, as he spoke, the darkness suddenly gave way to light, and angels appeared and listened to the Baal Shem Tov's words. \\"Your explanations,\\" he said to Dov Ber, \\"were correct, but your deductions were thoughts without any soul in them.\\" This experience persuaded Dov Ber to stay with the Baal Shem Tov.Martin Buber, Die Erz√§hlungen der Chassidim, 12. Auflage, Z√ºrich: Manesse Verlag, 1992, , p. 194This Day in Jewish History 1772: The Maggid, Untrained Successor to Baal Shem Tov, Dies, Haaretz Dov Ber is reported to have learned from the Baal Shem Tov to value everyday things and events, and to emphasize the proper attitude with which to study Torah. The mystical philosophy of the Baal Shem Tov rejected the emphasis on mortification of the body in Musar and Kabbalistic traditions, seeing the greater spiritual advantage in transforming the material into a vehicle for holiness, rather than breaking it. This could be achieved by the perception of the omnipresent Divine immanence in all things, from understanding the inner mystical Torah teachings of Hasidic thought. Under the guidance of the Baal Shem Tov, Dov Ber abandoned his ascetic lifestyle, and recovered his health, though his left foot remained lame. The Baal Shem Tov said that \\"before Dov Ber came to me, he was already a pure golden menorah (candelebrum). All I needed to do was ignite it.\\"The Great Maggid by Jacob Immanuel Schochet, Kehot Publication Society Regarding his holiness, the Baal Shem Tov also reputedly said that if Dov Ber had not been lame, and had been able to ritually immerse in the mikvah, then he could have been able to bring the Mashiach. Hasidic leadership  Immediately after the death of the Baal Shem Tov in 1760, his son Rabbi Tsvi became the next Rebbe. After only a year he gave up this position. Among the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov, two stood out as contenders to succeed him, Dov Ber and Yacov Yoseph of Polonne. Yacov Yoseph would later become the author of the first Hasidic book published (\\"Toldos Yaacov Yosef\\" in 1780), one of the most direct records of the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov. By collective consent, the Maggid assumed the leadership of Hasidism. In effect he became the architect of the Hasidic movement and is responsible for its successful dissemination. The Maggid was housebound because of his poor physical condition. Jewish philosopher Solomon Maimon records an encounter with the Maggid in his memoirs, in which he passes a strong negative judgement on the Hasidic movement. He relates that the Maggid passed the entire week in his room, permitting only a few confidants to enter. He appeared in public only on Shabbat, dressed in white satin. On those occasions he prayed with people, and kept open house for anyone who wanted to dine with him. After the meal he would reportedly begin to chant, and placing his hand upon his forehead, would ask those present to quote any verse from the Bible. These served as texts for the Maggid's subsequent sermon. Solomon Maimon wrote: \\"He was such a master in his craft that he combined these disjointed verses into an harmonious whole.\\"Solomon Maimon. \\"Selbstbiographie,\\" i. 231 et seq. in Kaufmann Kohler & Louis Ginzberg. \\"Baer 04/06 (Dob) of Meseritz\\", Jewish Encyclopedia, retrieved May 20, 2006 He attracted a remarkable group of scholarly and saintly disciples, including most of his fellow students of the Baal Shem Tov. The Baal Shem Tov had travelled across Jewish areas, reaching out to and inspiring the common folk, whose sincerity he cherished. He sought to revive the broken spirit of the simple Jews. At the same time, he would also seek out the great scholars of Talmud and Kabbalah, to win them over to Hasidism, to whom he taught the inner meaning of his teachings. Many Hasidic tales relate the stories of the Baal Shem Tov's travels, accompanied by his close disciples, and led by his non-Jewish wagon driver. Dov Ber, in contrast, set up his court in Mezhirichi, where his lameness restricted him, and devoted his main focus to articulating the mystical-philosophical system within the Baal Shem Tov's teachings to his close circle of disciples, who would lead the future movement. The simple folk were also able to visit during the Sabbath public attendancies of Dov Ber, and receive spiritual encouragement and comfort. The Maggid's court became the spiritual seat and place of pilgrimage of the second generation of the Hasidic movement, and moved its centre north from the Baal Shem Tov's residence in Medzhybizh. This move benefited the growth of the movement, as it was closer to new territories in Galicia, Poland and Belarus to reach. It was also nearer to the centre of Rabbinic opposition in Lithuania, who perceived of the new movement as a spiritual threat. The disciples of Dov Ber related that: > With the move of Rabbi Dov Ber, the Shechina (Divine Presence) \\"Packed up > Her belongings and moved from Medzhybizh to Mezeritch, and all we can do is > follow\\" The elite group of disciples, the \\"Chevraya Kaddisha\\" (\\"Holy Society\\"), included Rabbis Aharon of Karlin, Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, Elimelech of Lizhensk, Zusha of Hanipol, Shmelka (later Chief Rabbi of Nikolsburg) , Pinchas Horowitz (later Chief Rabbi of Frankfurt-am-Main and author of profound Talmudic commentaries), and Shneur Zalman of Liadi (author of the Tanya, and by instructions of his master, author of an updated version of the Shulchan Aruch code of Jewish Law for the new movement). These disciples, being themselves great Talmudic authorities and well-versed in Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy, were successful in turning Hasidus into a vast movement. Opposition of the Rabbis Hasidism spread rapidly as a result of Dov Ber's powerful personality, gaining footholds in Volhynia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. The dissolution of the \\"Four-Lands\\" synod in 1764 proved favorable to its spread. The local rabbis were annoyed by the growth of the movement, but could not easily do anything about it. The Gaon of Vilna was the only rabbi whose reputation extended beyond the borders of Lithuania. When Hasidism appeared in Vilna, the Vilna Gaon enacted the first major excommunication against Hasidism, which was issued on April 11, 1772. The Vilna Gaon believed the movement was antagonistic to Talmudic rabbinism and was suspicious that it was a remnant of the recent Sabbatean movement. See Hasidim and Mitnagdim. The Maggid's pupils Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk and Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi tried to visit the Vilna Gaon to bring about reconciliation, but the Vilna Gaon declined to meet them. Lubavitch legend has it that had the Gaon met with these two Rabbis, the Mashiach (Messiah) would have come. The ban issued at Vilna drew the eyes of the world toward Hasidism. Rabbi Dov Ber ignored the opposition, but it is blamed in part for his death in Mezhirichi on December 15, 1772. Spreading Hasidism Dov Ber assigned future territories of influence to his leading disciples. After the death of the Maggid in 1772, these disciples dispersed to their assigned territories. Under the Baal Shem Tov and then the Maggid, Hasidism had flourished in Podolia and Volhynia (present day Ukraine) . After 1772, under the third generation of leadership, it rapidly spread far and wide, from Galicia and Poland to White Russia (Belarus) in the north. The disciples of the Maggid took different interpretations and qualities of their Master's teachings. This, combined with the new dispersal of their locations, meant that after the Maggid, the Hasidic movement avoided appointing one unifying leader to succeed Dovber. The Maggid's disciple Elimelech of Lizhensk began Hasidism in Poland. His classic work Noam Elimelech focuses on the Hasidic doctrine of the Tzaddik (Saintly leader and Heavenly intercessor for the wider community). Schneur Zalman of Liadi described Noam Elimelech as the Hasidic \\"book of the righteous\\". In Hasidic history, Noam Elimelech became the spiritual doctrine for General- Hasidism, giving birth to the many leaders, successors and dynasties of mainstream Hasidism, and inspiring the emotional attachment and spiritual bond of the common folk to their Rebbe. Through attachment to the saintly individual, who knew mystical secrets, and interceded in Heaven on their behalf, the followers could connect to Divinity. Where the mainstream role of the Tzaddik was emphasised, it often accompanied belief in the benefit of miracle-working, to channel spiritual and material blessing, and increase fervour. The followers would make pilgrimages to their Masters, where they would gain enthusiasm, receive teachings, or could gain private audiences. Later dynasties such as Peshischa-Kotzk would break away from this General- Hasidic emphasis on Tzaddikim and mysticism. Among the other followers of Dov Ber in the academy of Mezeritch, the brother of Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk, Rabbi Zusha of Hanipol holds a beloved place in Hasidic tradition. Reputedly unable to receive a full teaching from the Maggid, as his excitement caused him to have to run out of the room in dveikus, his holy example personified the elevated soul of the Tzaddik. Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev, who spread Hasidism in the Ukraine, authored the classic Hasidic commentary on the Torah Kedushas Levi, and personified the advocacy of the Jewish people in its relationship with God. He innovated a new spiritual path in defending the people, and persuading their \\"Heavenly Father\\" to nullify harsh decrees. Views and teachings =Published writings= The Maggid left no writings of his own. Many of his teachings were recorded by his disciples and appeared in anthologies \\"MaggiD DebaraV le-Ya'akoV\\" (◊û◊í◊ô◊ì ◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô◊ï ◊ú◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë the last letters of which title spell \\"Dov\\"), known also under the title of Likkutei Amarim (\\"Collected Sayings\\"), published at Korets in 1780 (second edition with additions Korets, 1784), and frequently reprinted; Likkutim Yekarim (\\"Precious Collections\\"), published at Lemberg in 1792; Or Torah (the largest collection) published in Korets, 1804; Or Ha'emet published in Husiatin, 1899; Kitvei Kodesh (small collection) published in Lemberg. 1862; Shemu'ah Tovah (small collection) published in Warsaw. 1938. A number of manuscripts with additional teachings are in the National Library of the Hebrew University. They consist of excerpts from his sermons, transcribed and compiled by his students. The first to be published (Likkutei Amarim) was collated by his relative, Rabbi Solomon ben Abraham of Lutzk, who, as he himself notes, was unhappy with the manuscript but did not have time to edit it properly. There is a great deal of overlapping between all these texts, but each contains teachings that do not appear in the others. All the texts are corrupt, full of omissions, twisted order, printing-errors and other problems because they were based on whole chains of copyists who were not careful or had faulty manuscripts to begin with. It is only recently that serious work and editing has been done on them: Maggid Devarav Layaakov was edited by Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kohn (Jerusalem, 1961). Later, a critical edition was edited by Prof. Rivkah Shatz-Uffenheimer (Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1976). Recently, Kehot Publishing of Chabad put out another edition edited by Rabbi Jacob Immanuel Schochet (Brooklyn, NY, 2008). These recent editions all contain comprehensive introductions, annotations and indices. Or Torah has appeared in an authoritative, annotated edition with introduction, commentaries, comprehensive cross-references and detailed indices, authored by Rabbi Schochet (Brooklyn, NY, 2006). Likkutim Yekarim is in annotated edition by Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kohn (Jerusalem, 1974). =View of God= For the Maggid, God manifests Himself in creation, which is only one aspect of His activity, and which is therefore in reality a self-limitation. Just as God in His goodness limited Himself, and thus descended to the level of the world and man, so it is the duty of the latter to strive to unite with God. The removal of the outer shell of mundane things, or \\"the ascension of the [divine] spark,\\" being a recognition of the presence of God in all earthly things, it is the duty of man, should he experience pleasure, to receive it as a divine manifestation, for God is the source of all pleasure. =On the ecstasy of prayer= Rabbi Dov Ber's view of prayer was that it is the purpose of the life on earth to advance until the perfect union with God is attained. Thus the vegetable kingdom serves as food for the animal kingdom, in order that the lower manifestation of divinity, existing in the former, may be developed into a higher one. Man being the highest manifestation has a duty to attain the highest pinnacle in order to be united with God. The way to achieve this, he argued, is through prayer, in which man forgets himself and his surroundings, and concentrates all his thought and feeling upon union with God. Like the Neo-Platonists, he said that when a man becomes so absorbed in the contemplation of an object that his whole power of thought is concentrated upon one point, his self becomes unified with that point. So prayer in such a state of real ecstasy, effecting a union between God and man, is extremely important, and may even be able to overcome the laws of nature. =Role of the tzadik= Rabbi Dov Ber taught that only the tzadik is able to remove all his thoughts from earthly things and concentrate completely on God. Because of his union with God, he is the connecting link between God and creation, and thus the channel of blessing and mercy. The love that men have for the tzadik provides a path to God. The duty of the ordinary mortal is therefore to love the tzadik and be a student of his. In this connection Hasidim cite the classical Jewish teachingKetubot 111b that Scripture considers one who serves Torah scholars to be cleaving to the Almighty Himself.

The UUCP suite also includes (user interface for remote command execution), (the communication program that performs the file transfers), (reports statistics on recent activity), (execute commands sent from remote machines), and (reports the UUCP name of the local system). Some versions of the suite include / (convert 8-bit binary files to 7-bit text format and vice versa). Although UUCP was originally developed on Unix in the 1970s and 1980s, and is most closely associated with Unix-like systems, UUCP implementations exist for several non-Unix-like operating systems, including DOS, OS/2, OpenVMS (for VAX hardware only), AmigaOS, classic Mac OS, and even CP/M. Technology Before the widespread availability of Internet access, computers were only connected by smaller local area networks within a company or organization. They were also often equipped with modems so they could be used remotely from character-mode terminals via dial-up telephone lines. UUCP used the computers' modems to dial out to other computers, establishing temporary, point-to-point links between them. Each system in a UUCP network has a list of neighbor systems, with phone numbers, login names and passwords, etc. When work (file transfer or command execution requests) is queued for a neighbor system, the program typically calls that system to process the work. The program can also poll its neighbors periodically to check for work queued on their side; this permits neighbors without dial-out capability to participate. Over time, dial-up links were replaced by Internet connections, and UUCP added a number of new link layer protocols. These newer connections also reduced the need for UUCP at all, as newer application protocols developed to take advantage of the new networks. Today, UUCP is rarely used over dial-up links, but is occasionally used over TCP/IP. The number of systems involved, as of early 2006, ran between 1500 and 2000 sites across 60 enterprises. UUCP's longevity can be attributed to its low cost, extensive logging, native failover to dialup, and persistent queue management. =Sessions= UUCP is normally started by having a user log into the target system and then running the UUCP program. In most cases, this is automated by logging into a known user account used for transfers, whose account's shell has been set to . Thus, for automated transfers, another machine simply has to open a modem connection to the called machine and log into the known account. When uucico runs, it will expect to receive commands from another UUCP program on the caller's machine and begin a session. The session has three distinct stages: # Initial handshake # File request(s) # Final handshake Initial handshake On starting, uucico will respond by sending an identification string, \`\\\\20Shere=hostname\\\\0\`, where \\\\20 is the control-P character, and \\\\0 is a trailing null. The caller's UUCP responds with \`\\\\20Shostname options\\\\0\`, where options is a string containing zero or more Unix-like option switches. These can include packet and window sizes, the maximum supported file size, debugging options, and others. Depending on the setup of the two systems, the call may end here. For instance, when the caller responds with their system name, the called system may optionally hang up if it does not recognize the caller, sending the \`RYou are unknown to me\\\\0\` response string and then disconnecting. File requests If the two systems successfully handshake, the caller will now begin to send a series of file requests. There are four types: :S causes a file to be Sent from the caller to the called system (upload). The from and to names are provided, allowing the filename to be changed on the receiver. When the S command is received on the called system, it responds with SY if it succeeded and it is ready to accept the file, or SNx if it failed, where x is a failure reason. If an SY is received by the caller, it begins uploading the file using the protocol selected during the initial handshake (see below). When the transfer is complete, the called system responds with CY if it successfully received the file, or CN5 if it failed. :R is a Request for the called system to send a file to the caller (download). It is otherwise similar to S, using RY and RN to indicate the command was accepted and it will begin to send data or had a problem, and expecting a CY and CN5 from the caller at the end of the transfer. :X uploads commands to be eXecuted on the called system. This can be used to make that system call another and deliver files to it. The called system responds with XY if it succeeded, or XN if it failed. :H, for Hangup, indicates the caller is done. The called system responds with HY if it succeeded, or HN if it failed. Final handshake After sending an H command, the calling system sends a final packet (control-P, six ohs, null-terminator) and the called system responds with (control-P, seven ohs, null-terminator). Some systems will simply hang up on the successful reception of the H command and not bother with the final handshake. =g-protocol= Within the suite of protocols in UUCP, the underlying g-protocol is responsible for transferring information in an error-free form. The protocol originated as a general- purpose system for packet delivery, and thus offers a number of features that are not used by the UUCP package as a whole. These include a secondary channel that can send command data interspersed with a file transfer, and the ability to renegotiate the packet and window sizes during transmission. These extra features may not be available in some implementations of the UUCP stack. The packet format consisted of a 6-byte header and then between zero and 4096 bytes in the payload. The packet starts with a single \\\\020 (control-P). This is followed by a single byte, known as \\"K\\", containing a value of 1 to 8 indicating a packet size from 32 to 4096 bytes, or a 9 indicating a control packet. Many systems only supported K=2, meaning 64 bytes. The next two bytes were a 16-bit checksum of the payload, not including the header. The next byte is the data type and finally, the last byte is the XOR of the header, allowing it to be checked separately from the payload. The control byte consists of three bit-fields in the format TTXXXYYY. TT is the packet type, 0 for control packets (which also requires K=9 to be valid), 1 for alternate data (not used in UUCP), 2 for data, and 3 indicates a short packet that re-defines the meaning of K. In a data packet, XXX is the packet number for this packet from 0 to 7, and YYY is the last that was received correctly. This provides up to 8 packets in a window. In a control packet, XXX indicates the command and YYY is used for various parameters. For instance, transfers are started by sending a short control packet with TT=0 (control), XXX=7 and YYY the number of packets in a window, then sending another packet with XXX=6 and YYY as the packet length (encoded as it would be in K) and then a third packet that is identical to the first but XXX=5. g-protocol uses a simple sliding window system to deal with potentially long latencies between endpoints. The protocol allows packets to size from 64 to 4096 8-bit bytes, and windows that include 1 to 7 packets. In theory, a system using 4k packets and 7 packet windows (4096x7) would offer performance matching or beating the best file-transfer protocols like ZMODEM. In practice, many implementations only supported a single setting of 64x3. As a result, the g-protocol has an undeserved reputation for poor performance. Confusion over the packet and window sizes led to the G-protocol, differing only in that it always used 4096x3. Taylor UUCP did not support G, but did support any valid requested window or packet size, so remote systems starting G would work fine with Taylor's g, while two Taylor systems could negotiate even faster connections. Telebit modems used protocol spoofing to improve the performance of g-protocol transfers by noticing end-of-packet markers being sent to the remote system and immediately sending an back to the local host, pretending that the remote system had already received the packet and decoded it correctly. This triggered the software stack to send the next packet, so rapidly that the transfer became almost continuous. The data between the two modems was error-corrected using a proprietary protocol based on MNP that ran over Telebit's half-duplex connections much better than g-protocol would normally, because in the common 64x3 case the remote system would be sending a constant stream of s that would overflow the low-speed return channel. Combined with the modem's naturally higher data rates, they greatly improved overall throughput and generally performed about seven times the speed of a 2400 bps modem. They were widely used on UUCP hosts as they could quickly pay for themselves in reduced long-distance charges. =Other protocols= UUCP implementations also include other transfer protocols for use over certain links. f-protocol is designed to run over 7-bit error-corrected links. This was originally intended for use on X.25 links, which were popular for a time in the 1980s. It does not packetize data, instead, the entire file is sent as a single long string followed by a whole-file checksum. The similar x-protocol appears to have seen little or no use. d-protocol was similar to x, but intended for use on the obsolete DataKit network. t-protocol originated in the BSD versions of UUCP and is designed to run over 8-bit error-free TCP/IP links. It has no error correction at all, and the protocol consists simply of breaking up command and file data into 512 or 1024-byte packets to easily fit within typical TCP frames. The less-used e-protocol, which originated the HoneyDanBer versions as opposed to t from BSD, differs only in that commands are not packetized and are instead sent as normal strings, while files are padded to the nearest 20 bytes. History UUCP was originally written at AT&T; Bell Laboratories by Mike Lesk. By 1978 it was in use on 82 UNIX machines inside the Bell system, primarily for software distribution. It was released in 1979 as part of Version 7 Unix.Version 7 Unix manual: \\"UUCP Implementation Description\\" by D. A. Nowitz, and \\"A Dial-Up Network of UNIX Systems\\" by D. A. Nowitz and M. E. Lesk The original UUCP was rewritten by AT&T; researchers Peter Honeyman, David A. Nowitz, and Brian E. Redman around 1983. The rewrite is referred to as HDB or HoneyDanBer uucp, which was later enhanced, bug fixed, and repackaged as BNU UUCP (\\"Basic Network Utilities\\"). Each of these versions was distributed as proprietary software, which inspired Ian Lance Taylor to write a new free software version from scratch in 1991. Taylor UUCP was released under the GNU General Public License. Taylor UUCP addressed security holes which allowed some of the original network worms to remotely execute unexpected shell commands. Taylor UUCP also incorporated features of all previous versions of UUCP, allowing it to communicate with any other version and even use similar config file formats from other versions. UUCP was also implemented for non-UNIX operating systems, most-notably DOS systems. Packages such as UUSLAVE/GNUUCP (John Gilmore, Garry Paxinos, Tim Pozar), UUPC (Drew Derbyshire) and FSUUCP (Christopher Ambler of IODesign), brought early Internet connectivity to personal computers, expanding the network beyond the interconnected university systems. FSUUCP formed the basis for many bulletin board system (BBS) packages such as Galacticomm's Major BBS and Mustang Software's Wildcat! BBS to connect to the UUCP network and exchange email and Usenet traffic. As an example, UFGATE (John Galvin, Garry Paxinos, Tim Pozar) was a package that provided a gateway between networks running Fidonet and UUCP protocols. FSUUCP was the only other implementation of Taylor's enhanced 'i' protocol, a significant improvement over the standard 'g' protocol used by most UUCP implementations. Mail routing Business card with UUCP email address The and capabilities could be used to send email between machines, with suitable mail user interfaces and delivery agent programs. A simple UUCP mail address was formed from the adjacent machine name, an exclamation mark (often pronounced bang), followed by the user name on the adjacent machine. For example, the address barbox!user would refer to user user on adjacent machine barbox. Mail could furthermore be routed through the network, traversing any number of intermediate nodes before arriving at its destination. Initially, this had to be done by specifying the complete path, with a list of intermediate host names separated by bangs. For example, if machine barbox is not connected to the local machine, but it is known that barbox is connected to machine foovax which does communicate with the local machine, the appropriate address to send mail to would be foovax!barbox!user. User barbox!user would generally publish their UUCP email address in a form such as ‚Ä¶!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user. This directs people to route their mail to machine bigsite (presumably a well-known and well-connected machine accessible to everybody) and from there through the machine foovax to the account of user user on barbox. Publishing a full path would be pointless, because it would be different, depending on where the sender was. (e.g. Ann at one site may have to send via path gway!tcol!canty!uoh!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user, whereas from somewhere else, Bill has to send via the path pdp10!router22!bigsite!foovax!barbox!user). Many users would suggest multiple routes from various large well-known sites, providing even better and perhaps faster connection service from the mail sender. =Bang path= An email address of this form was known as a bang path. Bang paths of eight to ten machines (or hops) were not uncommon in 1981, and late-night dial-up UUCP links would cause week-long transmission times. Bang paths were often selected by both transmission time and reliability, as messages would often get lost. Some hosts went so far as to try to \\"rewrite\\" the path, sending mail via \\"faster\\" routes‚Äîthis practice tended to be frowned upon. The \\"pseudo-domain\\" ending .uucp was sometimes used to designate a hostname as being reachable by UUCP networking, although this was never formally registered in the domain name system (DNS) as a top-level domain. The uucp community administered itself and did not mesh well with the administration methods and regulations governing the DNS; .uucp works where it needs to; some hosts punt mail out of SMTP queue into uucp queues on gateway machines if a .uucp address is recognized on an incoming SMTP connection. Usenet traffic was originally transmitted over the UUCP protocol using bang paths. These are still in use within Usenet message format Path header lines. They now have only an informational purpose, and are not used for routing, although they can be used to ensure that loops do not occur. In general, like other older e-mail address formats, bang paths have now been superseded by the \\"@ notation\\", even by sites still using UUCP. A UUCP-only site can register a DNS domain name, and have the DNS server that handles that domain provide MX records that cause Internet mail to that site to be delivered to a UUCP host on the Internet that can then deliver the mail to the UUCP site. UUCPNET and mapping UUCPNET was the name for the totality of the network of computers connected through UUCP. This network was very informal, maintained in a spirit of mutual cooperation between systems owned by thousands of private companies, universities, and so on. Often, particularly in the private sector, UUCP links were established without official approval from the companies' upper management. The UUCP network was constantly changing as new systems and dial- up links were added, others were removed, etc. The UUCP Mapping Project was a volunteer, largely successful effort to build a map of the connections between machines that were open mail relays and establish a managed namespace. Each system administrator would submit, by e-mail, a list of the systems to which theirs would connect, along with a ranking for each such connection. These submitted map entries were processed by an automatic program that combined them into a single set of files describing all connections in the network. These files were then published monthly in a newsgroup dedicated to this purpose. The UUCP map files could then be used by software such as \\"pathalias\\" to compute the best route path from one machine to another for mail, and to supply this route automatically. The UUCP maps also listed contact information for the sites, and so gave sites seeking to join UUCPNET an easy way to find prospective neighbors. Connections with the Internet Many UUCP hosts, particularly those at universities, were also connected to the Internet in its early years, and e-mail gateways between Internet SMTP-based mail and UUCP mail were developed. A user at a system with UUCP connections could thereby exchange mail with Internet users, and the Internet links could be used to bypass large portions of the slow UUCP network. A \\"UUCP zone\\" was defined within the Internet domain namespace to facilitate these interfaces. With this infrastructure in place, UUCP's strength was that it permitted a site to gain Internet e-mail and Usenet connectivity with only a dial-up modem link to another cooperating computer. This was at a time when true Internet access required a leased data line providing a connection to an Internet Point of Presence, both of which were expensive and difficult to arrange. By contrast, a link to the UUCP network could usually be established with a few phone calls to the administrators of prospective neighbor systems. Neighbor systems were often close enough to avoid all but the most basic charges for telephone calls. Remote commands uux is remote command execution over UUCP. The uux command is used to execute a command on a remote system, or to execute a command on the local system using files from remote systems. The command is run by the daemon, which handles remote execution requests as simply another kind of file to batch-send to the remote system whenever a next-hop node is available. The remote system will then execute the requested command and return the result, when the original system is available. Both of these transfers may be indirect, via multi-hop paths, with arbitrary windows of availability. Even when executing a command on an always-available neighbor, uux is not instant. Decline UUCP usage began to die out with the rise of Internet service providers offering inexpensive SLIP and PPP services. The UUCP Mapping Project was formally shut down in late 2000. The UUCP protocol has now mostly been replaced by the Internet TCP/IP based protocols SMTP for mail and NNTP for Usenet news. In July 2012, Dutch Internet provider XS4ALL closed down its UUCP service, claiming it was \\"probably one of the last providers in the world that still offered it\\"; it had only 13 users at that time (however prior to its shut-down it had refused requests from new users for several years). Last uses and legacy One surviving feature of UUCP is the chat file format, largely inherited by the Expect software package. UUCP was in use over special-purpose high cost links (e.g. marine satellite links) long after its disappearance elsewhere, and still remains in legacy use. In the mid 2000s, UUCP over TCP/IP (often encrypted, using the SSH protocol) was proposed for use when a computer does not have any fixed IP addresses but is still willing to run a standard mail transfer agent (MTA) like Sendmail or Postfix. Bang-like paths are still in use within the Usenet network, though not for routing; they are used to record, in the header of a message, the nodes through which that message has passed, rather than to direct where it will go next. \\"Bang path\\" is also used as an expression for any explicitly specified routing path between network hosts. That usage is not necessarily limited to UUCP, IP routing, email messaging, or Usenet. The concept of delay- tolerant networking protocols was revisited in the early 2000s. Similar techniques as those used by UUCP can apply to other networks that experience delay or significant disruption.

Schmidt's grave in the garden of his house in Bargfeld. Arno Schmidt (; 18 January 1914 ‚Äì 3 June 1979) was a German author and translator. He is little known outside of German-speaking areas, in part because his works present a formidable challenge to translators. Although he is not one of the popular favourites within Germany, critics and writers often consider him to be one of the most important German-language writers of the 20th century. Biography Born in Hamburg, the son of a police constable, Schmidt moved in 1928, after the death of his father, with his mother, to her hometown of Lauban (in Lusatia, then Lower Silesia, now Poland) and attended secondary school in G√∂rlitz as well as a trade school there. After finishing school he was unemployed for some months and then, in 1934, began a commercial apprenticeship at a textile company in Greiffenberg. After finishing his apprenticeship he was hired by the same company as a stock accountant. Around this time, at his company, he met his future wife, Alice Murawski. The couple married on 21 August 1937; they had no children. At the outset of World War II, in 1939, Schmidt was drafted into the Wehrmacht, where his mathematical skills led him to be assigned to the artillery corps. He first served in Alsace and after 1941 in fairly quiet Norway. In 1945, Schmidt volunteered for active front duty in Northern Germany, in order to be granted a brief home visit. As the war was obviously lost, he used this visit to organise his wife's and his own escape to the west of Germany, in order to evade capture by the Red Army, which was known for its much harsher treatment of prisoners of war and German civilians. Schmidt gave himself up to British forces in Lower Saxony. As refugees, Schmidt and his wife lost almost all of their possessions, including their cherished book collection. After an interlude as an English POW and later as an interpreter at a police school, Schmidt began his career as a freelance writer in 1946. Since Schmidt's pre-war home in Lauban was now under Polish administration, Schmidt and his wife were among the millions of refugees moved by the authorities to numerous places in what was to become West Germany. During this time of uncertainty and extreme poverty the Schmidts were sustained by CARE Packages his sister sent them from the US (his sister Lucie had emigrated to the US in 1939, together with her husband Rudy Kiesler, a Jewish German communist). Temporary accommodations led the Schmidts to Cordingen (near Bomlitz), Gau-Bickelheim, and Kastel (the latter two in the newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate). In Kastel, he was accused in court of blasphemy and moral subversion, then still considered a crime in some of the Catholic regions of Germany. As a result, Schmidt and his wife moved to the Protestant city of Darmstadt in Hesse, where the suit against him was dismissed. In 1958, the Schmidts moved to the small village of Bargfeld, where they were to stay for the rest of their lives, Schmidt dying in 1979, his wife Alice in 1983. Writing style and personal philosophy Schmidt was a strict individualist, almost a solipsist. Disaffected by his experience of the Third Reich, he had an extremely pessimistic world view. In Schwarze Spiegel (Black mirrors), he describes his utopia as an empty world after an anthropogenic apocalypse. Although he was not a deist in the conventional sense, he maintained that the world was created by a monster called Leviathan, whose predatory nature was passed on to humans. Still, he thought this monster could not be too powerful to be attacked, if it behooved humanity. His writing style is characterized by a unique and witty style of adapting colloquial language, which won him quite a few fervent admirers. Moreover, he developed an orthography by which he thought to reveal the true meaning of words and their connections amongst each other. One of the most cited examples is the use of ‚ÄúRoh=Mann=Tick\\" instead of \\"Romantik\\" (revealing romanticism as the craze of unsubtle men). The atoms of words holding the nuclei of original meaning he called Etyme (etyms). Zettel's Dream His theory of etyms is developed in his magnum opus, Zettels Traum, in which an elderly writer comments on Edgar Allan Poe's works in a stream of consciousness, while discussing a Poe translation with a couple of translators and flirting with their teenage daughter. Schmidt also accomplished a translation of Edgar Allan Poe's works himself (1966‚Äì1973, together with Hans Wollschl√§ger). Some critics even dismissed Zettel's Traum as non-art, or sheer nonsense, and Schmidt himself as a \\"psychopath.\\" But Schmidt's reputation as esoteric, and that of his work as non-art, has faded and he is now seen as an important, if highly eccentric, German writer of the 20th century.Arno Schmidt's Zettel's Traum: an analysis by Volker Max Langbehn, 2003, page 4 Other, minor works In the 1960s, he authored a series of plays for German radio stations presenting forgotten or little known and‚Äîin his opinion‚Äîvastly underrated authors, e.g. Johann Gottfried Schnabel, Karl Philipp Moritz, Leopold Schefer, Karl Ferdinand Gutzkow, and others. These \\"plays\\" are basically talks about literature with two or three participants plus voices for quotations (Schmidt lent his voice for his translations of Finnegans Wake quoted in Der Triton mit dem Sonnenschirm [1961]). Eleven of these so-called \\"Radio-Essays\\" were republished on 12 audio CDs in the year 2003. The final years As none of his works sold more than a few thousand copies (Schmidt openly admitted that he only wrote for the small handful of people who could appreciate his work), he lived in extreme poverty. During the last few years of his life, Arno Schmidt was financially supported by the philologist and writer Jan Philipp Reemtsma, the heir of the German cigarette manufacturer Philipp F. Reemtsma. Schmidt's final completed novel was Abend mit Goldrand (1975) which was praised by some critics for its verbal inventiveness, although many had a difficult time digesting the erotic themes of the book. He died in a hospital in Celle on 3 June 1979 after suffering a stroke. Posthumous legacy Dalkey Archive Press has reissued five volumes of Schmidt's work translated by John E. Woods. The series includes Collected Novellas, Collected Stories, Nobodaddy's Children, Two Novels, and most recently, Bottom's Dream (Zettels Traum). The reissues were scheduled to coincide with \\"Rediscovering Arno Schmidt events in the US, UK, and continental Europe.\\"Dalkey Archive Press The Arno Schmidt Foundation (Arno Schmidt Stiftung) in Bargfeld, sponsored by Jan Philipp Reemtsma, is publishing his complete works. =Arno Schmidt Prize= The Arno Schmidt Prize, awarded by the Arno Schmidt Foundation and awarded from 1981 to 1988, was endowed with DM 50,000 (about ‚Ç¨25,000).

More specifically, it is classified as a thermally-allowed [4+2] cycloaddition with Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann symbol [œÄ4s \\\\+ œÄ2s]. It was first described by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928. For the discovery of this reaction, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950. Through the simultaneous construction of two new carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds, the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction provides a reliable way to form six-membered rings with good control over the regio- and stereochemical outcomes. Consequently, it has served as a powerful and widely applied tool for the introduction of chemical complexity in the synthesis of natural products and new materials. The underlying concept has also been applied to œÄ-systems involving heteroatoms, such as carbonyls and imines, which furnish the corresponding heterocycles; this variant is known as the hetero-Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. The reaction has also been generalized to other ring sizes, although none of these generalizations have matched the formation of six-membered rings in terms of scope or versatility. Because of the negative values of ŒîH¬∞ and ŒîS¬∞ for a typical Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, the microscopic reverse of a Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction becomes favorable at high temperatures, although this is of synthetic importance for only a limited range of Diels-Alder adducts, generally with some special structural features; this reverse reaction is known as the retro-Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. Mechanism The reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction.Carey, Part B., pp. 474‚Äì526 It is believed to occur via a single, cyclic transition state, with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction. As such, the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction is governed by orbital symmetry considerations: it is classified as a [œÄ4s \\\\+ œÄ2s] cycloaddition, indicating that it proceeds through the suprafacial/suprafacial interaction of a 4œÄ electron system (the diene structure) with a 2œÄ electron system (the dienophile structure), an interaction that leads to a transition state without an additional orbital symmetry-imposed energetic barrier and allows the Diels- Alder reaction to take place with relative ease.Carey, Part A., pp. 836‚Äì50 A consideration of the reactants' frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) makes plain why this is so. (The same conclusion can be drawn from an orbital correlation diagram or a Dewar-Zimmerman analysis.) For the more common \\"normal\\" electron demand Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, the more important of the two HOMO/LUMO interactions is that between the electron-rich diene's œà2 as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with the electron-deficient dienophile's œÄ* as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). However, the HOMO‚ÄìLUMO energy gap is close enough that the roles can be reversed by switching electronic effects of the substituents on the two components. In an inverse (reverse) electron-demand Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, electron-withdrawing substituents on the diene lower the energy of its empty œà3 orbital and electron-donating substituents on the dienophile raise the energy of its filled œÄ orbital sufficiently that the interaction between these two orbitals becomes the most energetically significant stabilizing orbital interaction. Regardless of which situation pertains, the HOMO and LUMO of the components are in phase and a bonding interaction results as can be seen in the diagram below. Since the reactants are in their ground state, the reaction is initiated thermally and does not require activation by light. FMO analysis of the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction The \\"prevailing opinion\\"Carey, Part A., p. 839 is that most Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions proceed through a concerted mechanism; the issue, however, has been thoroughly contested. Despite the fact that the vast majority of Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions exhibit stereospecific, syn addition of the two components, a diradical intermediate has been postulated (and supported with computational evidence) on the grounds that the observed stereospecificity does not rule out a two-step addition involving an intermediate that collapses to product faster than it can rotate to allow for inversion of stereochemistry. There is a notable rate enhancement when certain Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions are carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol. and even in water. The reaction of cyclopentadiene and butenone for example is 700 times faster in water relative to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane as solvent. Several explanations for this effect have been proposed, such as an increase in effective concentration due to hydrophobic packing or hydrogen-bond stabilization of the transition state. The geometry of the diene and dienophile components each propagate into stereochemical details of the product. For intermolecular reactions especially, the preferred positional and stereochemical relationship of subtituents of the two components compared to each other are controlled by electronic effects. However, for intramolecular Diels‚ÄìAlder cycloaddition reactions, the conformational stability of the structure the transition state can be an overwhelming influence. =Regioselectivity= Frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions of substituted systems. Calculation of the energy and orbital coefficients of the components' frontier orbitals provides a picture that is in good accord with the more straightforward analysis of the substituents' resonance effects, as illustrated below. alt= In general, the regioselectivity found for both normal and inverse electron-demand Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction follows the ortho-para rule, so named, because the cyclohexene product bears substituents in positions that are analogous to the ortho and para positions of disubstituted arenes. For example, in a normal-demand scenario, a diene bearing an electron-donating group (EDG) at C1 has its largest HOMO coefficient at C4, while the dienophile with an electron withdrawing group (EWG) at C1 has the largest LUMO coefficient at C2. Pairing these two coefficients gives the \\"ortho\\" product as seen in case 1 in the figure below. A diene substituted at C2 as in case 2 below has the largest HOMO coefficient at C1, giving rise to the \\"para\\" product. Similar analyses for the corresponding inverse-demand scenarios gives rise to the analogous products as seen in cases 3 and 4. Examining the canonical mesomeric forms above, it is easy to verify that these results are in accord with expectations based on consideration of electron density and polarization. alt= In general, with respect to the energetically most well-matched HOMO-LUMO pair, maximizing the interaction energy by forming bonds between centers with the largest frontier orbital coefficients allows the prediction of the main regioisomer that will result from a given diene-dienophile combination. In a more sophisticated treatment, three types of substituents (Z withdrawing: HOMO and LUMO lowering (CF3, NO2, CN, C(O)CH3), X donating: HOMO and LUMO raising (Me, OMe, NMe2), C conjugating: HOMO raising and LUMO lowering (Ph, vinyl)) are considered, resulting in a total of 18 possible combinations. The maximization of orbital interaction correctly predicts the product in all cases for which experimental data is available. For instance, in uncommon combinations involving X groups on both diene and dienophile, a 1,3-substitution pattern may be favored, an outcome not accounted for by a simplistic resonance structure argument. However, cases where the resonance argument and the matching of largest orbital coefficients disagree are rare. =Stereospecificity and stereoselectivity= Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions, as concerted cycloadditions, are stereospecific. Stereochemical information of the diene and the dienophile are retained in the product, as a syn addition with respect to each component. For example, substituents in a cis (trans, resp.) relationship on the double bond of the dienophile give rise to substituents that are cis (trans, resp.) on those same carbons with respect to the cyclohexene ring. Likewise, cis,cis- and trans,trans-disubstitued dienes give cis substituents at these carbons of the product whereas cis,trans- disubstituted dienes give trans substituents: 500x500pxEndo and exo transition states for cyclopentadiene adding to thumb Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions in which adjacent stereocenters are generated at the two ends of the newly-formed single bonds imply two different possible stereochemical outcomes. This is a stereoselective situation based on the relative orientation of the two separate components when they react with each other. In the context of the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, the transition state in which the most significant substituent (an electron-withdrawing and/or conjugating group) on the dienophile is oriented towards the diene œÄ system and slips under it as the reaction takes place is known as the endo transition state. In the alternative exo transition state, it is oriented away from it. (There is a more general usage of the terms endo and exo in stereochemical nomenclature.) In cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituent, or two electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituents cis to each other, the outcome can often be predicted. In these \\"normal demand\\" Diels‚ÄìAlder scenarios, the endo transition state is typically preferred, despite often being more sterically congested. This preference is known as the Alder endo rule. As originally stated by Alder, the transition state that is preferred is the one with a \\"maximum accumulation of double bonds.\\" Endo selectivity is typically higher for rigid dienophiles such as maleic anhydride and benzoquinone; for others, such as acrylates and crotonates, selectivity is not very pronounced. The endo rule applies when there the electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile are all on one side.The most widely accepted explanation for the origin of this effect is a favorable interaction between the œÄ systems of the dienophile and the diene, an interaction described as a secondary orbital effect, though dipolar and van der Waals attractions may play a part as well, and solvent can sometimes make a substantial difference in selectivity. The secondary orbital overlap explanation was first proposed by Woodward and Hoffmann. In this explanation, the orbitals associated with the group in conjugation with the dienophile double-bond overlap with the interior orbitals of the diene, a situation that is possible only for the endo transition state. Although the original explanation only invoked the orbital on the atom Œ± to the dienophile double bond, Salem and Houk have subsequently proposed that orbitals on the Œ± and Œ≤ carbons both participate when molecular geometry allows. 400x400px Often, as with highly substituted dienes, very bulky dienophiles, or reversible reactions (as in the case of furan as diene), steric effects can override the normal endo selectivity in favor of the exo isomer. =The diene= The diene component of the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic, and it can host many different types of substituents; it must, however, be able to exist in the s-cis conformation, since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction. Though butadienes are typically more stable in the s-trans conformation, for most cases energy difference is small (~2‚Äì5 kcal/mol).Carey, Part A, p. 149 A bulky substituent at the C2 or C3 position can increase reaction rate by destabilizing the s-trans conformation and forcing the diene into the reactive s-cis conformation. 2-tert-butyl-buta-1,3-diene, for example, is 27 times more reactive than simple butadiene. Conversely, a diene having bulky substituents at both C2 and C3 are less reactive because the steric interactions between the substituents destabilize the s-cis conformation. Dienes with bulky terminal substituents (C1 and C4) decrease the rate of reaction, presumably by impeding the approach of the diene and dienophile. An especially reactive diene is 1-methoxy-3-trimethylsiloxy-buta-1,3-diene, otherwise known as Danishefsky's diene. It has particular synthetic utility as means of furnishing Œ±,Œ≤‚Äìunsaturated cyclohexenone systems by elimination of the 1-methoxy substituent after deprotection of the enol silyl ether. Other synthetically useful derivatives of Danishefsky's diene include 1,3-alkoxy-1-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadienes (Brassard dienes) and 1-dialkylamino-3-trimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadienes (Rawal dienes). The increased reactivity of these and similar dienes is a result of synergistic contributions from donor groups at C1 and C3, raising the HOMO significantly above that of a comparable monosubstituted diene. General form of Danishefsky, Brassard, and Rawal dienes Unstable (and thus highly reactive) dienes, of which perhaps the most synthetically useful are o-quinodimethanes, can be generated in situ. A strong driving force for the [4+2] cycloaddition of such species is a result of the establishment (or reestablishment) of aromaticity. Common methods for generating o-quinodimethanes include pyrolysis of benzocyclobutenes or the corresponding sulfone, 1,4-elimination of ortho benzylic silanes or stannanes, and reduction of Œ±,Œ±'-ortho benzylic dibromides. in situ generation of o-quinodomethanes On the contrary, stable dienes are rather unreactive and undergo Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions only at elevated temperatures: for example, naphthalene can function as a diene, leading to adducts only with highly reactive dienophiles, such as N-phenyl- maleimide. Anthracene, being less aromatic (and therefore more reactive for Diels‚ÄìAlder syntheses) in its central ring can form a 9,10 adduct with maleic anhydride at 80 ¬∞C and even with acetylene, a weak dienophile, at 250 ¬∞C.Margareta Avram (1983). Chimie organica p. 318-323. Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste Rom√¢nia =The dienophile= In a normal demand Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, the dienophile has an electron-withdrawing group in conjugation with the alkene; in an inverse-demand scenario, the dienophile is conjugated with an electron-donating group. Dienophiles can be chosen to contain a \\"masked functionality\\". The dienophile undergoes Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule. A series of reactions then follow to transform the functionality into a desirable group. The end product cannot not be made in a single DA step because equivalent dienophile is either unreactive or inaccessible. An example of such approach is the use of Œ±-chloroacrylonitrile (CH2=CClCN). When reacted with a diene, this dienophile will introduce Œ±-chloronitrile functionality onto the product molecule. This is a \\"masked functionality\\" which can be then hydrolyzed to form a ketone. Œ±-Chloroacrylonitrile dienophile is an equivalent of ketene dienophile (CH2=C=O), which would produce same product in one DA step. The problem is that ketene itself cannot be used in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions because it reacts with dienes in unwanted manner (by [2+2] cycloaddition), and therefore \\"masked functionality\\" approach has to be used. Other such functionalities are phosphonium substituents (yielding exocyclic double bonds after Wittig reaction), various sulfoxide and sulfonyl functionalities (both are acetylene equivalents), and nitro groups (ketene equivalents). Variants on the classical Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction =Hetero- Diels‚ÄìAlder= Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions involving at least one heteroatom are also known and are collectively called hetero-Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions. Carbonyl groups, for example, can successfully react with dienes to yield dihydropyran rings, a reaction known as the oxo-Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, and imines can be used, either as the dienophile or at various sites in the diene, to form various N-heterocyclic compounds through the aza-Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. Nitroso compounds (R-N=O) can react with dienes to form oxazines. Chlorosulfonyl isocyanate can be utilized as a dienophile to prepare Vince lactam. =Lewis acid activation= Lewis acids such as zinc chloride, boron trifluoride, tin tetrachloride, aluminum chloride, etc. can act as catalysts of normal-demand Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions by coordination to the dienophile. The complexed dienophile becomes more electrophilic and more reactive toward the diene, increasing the reaction rate and often improving the regio- and stereoselectivity as well. Lewis acid catalysis also enables Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions to proceed at low temperatures, i.e. without thermal activation. =Asymmetric Diels‚ÄìAlder= Many methods have been developed for influencing the stereoselectivity of the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, such as the use of chiral auxiliaries, catalysis by chiral Lewis acids, and small organic molecule catalysts. Evans' oxazolidinones, oxazaborolidines, bis-oxazoline‚Äìcopper chelates, imidazoline catalysis, and many other methodologies exist for effecting diastereo- and enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions. = Hexadehydro Diels‚ÄìAlder = In the hexadehydro Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, alkynes and diynes are used instead of alkenes and dienes, forming an unstable benzyne intermediate which can then be trapped to form an aromatic product. This reaction allows the formation of heavily-functionalized aromatic rings in a single step.Hoye, T. R.; Baire, B.; Niu, D.; Willoughby, P. H.; Woods, B. P. Nature, 2012, 490, 208 Applications The retro Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction is used in the industrial production of cyclopentadiene. Cyclopentadiene is a precursor to various norbornenes, which are common monomers. The Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction is also employed in the production of vitamin B6. Typical route for production of ethylidene norbornene from cyclopentadiene through vinyl norbornene. History The reaction discovered by Diels and Alder in 1928. The work by Diels and Alder is described in a series of 28 articles published in the Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie and Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft from 1928 to 1937. The first 19 articles were authored by Diels and Alder, while the later articles were authored by Diels and various contributors.        The first application of Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction in total synthesis was illustrated by R. B. Woodward's syntheses of the steroids cortisone and cholesterol. The reaction of butadiene with the quinone below furnished the C and D rings of the steroid skeleton with the desired regiochemistry. center E. J. Corey, in his original 1969 synthesis of prostaglandins F2Œ± and E2, utilized a Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction early in the synthesis to establish the relative stereochemistry of three contiguous stereocenters on the prostaglandin cyclopentane core. To mitigate isomerization of the substituted cyclopentadiene via 1,5-hydride shift, it was found necessary to keep this intermediate below 0 ¬∞C until the Diels‚ÄìAlder could take place. Thus activation by strongly Lewis acidic cupric tetrafluoroborate was required to allow for the reaction to take place. The use of 2-chloroacrylonitrile as dienophile is a viable synthetic equivalent for ketene, a structure that typically underdoes a [2+2] cycloaddition to give a cyclobutanone dimer rather than participating in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions with 1,3-dienes. Hydrolysis of the epimeric mixture of chloronitrile adducts revealed the desired bicycloheptanone in high yield. center Samuel J. Danishefsky used a Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction to synthesize disodium prephenate, a biosynthetic precursor of the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, in 1979. This sequence is notable as one of the earliest to feature 1-methoxy-3-siloxybutadiene, the so-called Danishefsky diene, in total synthesis. Its utility is apparent below, namely, the ready furnishing of Œ±,Œ≤‚Äìunsaturated cyclohexenone systems. In their 1980 synthesis of reserpine, Paul Wender and coworkers used a Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction to set the cis-decalin framework of the D and E rings of the natural product. The initial Diels-Alder between 2-acetoxyacrylic acid and the 1,2-dihydropyridine-1-carboxylate shown below put the newly installed carboxyl group in a position to rearrange exclusively to the cis-fused rings after conversion to the isoquinuclidene shown below. The cis-fusion allowed for the establishment of the stereochemistry at C17 and C18: first by cleavage of the acetate group at C18 to give a ketone that can modulate the stereochemistry of the methoxy group C17, and then by reduction of the ketone at C18 from the exo face to achieve the stereochemistry of the final product. center In Stephen F. Martin's synthesis of reserpine, the cis-fused D and E rings were also formed by a Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. Intramolecular Diels‚ÄìAlder of the pyranone below with subsequent extrusion of carbon dioxide via a retro [4+2] afforded the bicyclic lactam. Epoxidation from the less hindered Œ±-face, followed by epoxide opening at the less hindered C18 afforded the desired stereochemistry at these positions, while the cis-fusion was achieved with hydrogenation, again proceeding primarily from the less hindered face. center A pyranone was similarly used as the dienophile by K. C. Nicolaou's group in the total synthesis of taxol. The intermolecular reaction of the hydroxy-pyrone and Œ±,Œ≤‚Äìunsaturated ester shown below suffered from poor yield and regioselectivity; however, when directed by phenylboronic acid the desired adduct could be obtained in 61% yield after cleavage of the boronate with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol. The stereospecificity of the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction in this instance allowed for the definition of four stereocenters that were carried on to the final product. center A Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction was the key step in Amos Smith's synthesis of (-)-furaquinocin C. Dione 1 was converted to the requisite diene by enolization using two successive silylations with TMSCl. The Diels‚ÄìAlder cycloaddition with bromoquinone was followed by a spontaneous dehydrohalogenation to re-form the aromatic ring. The diene in this instance is notable as a rare example of a cyclic derivative of Danishefsky's diene. center Viresh Rawal and Sergey Kozmin, in their 1998 synthesis of tabersonine, used a Diels‚ÄìAlder to establish cis relative stereochemistry of the alkaloid core. Conversion of the cis-aldehyde to its corresponding alkene by Wittig olefination and subsequent ring-closing metathesis with a Schrock catalyst gave the second ring of the alkaloid core. The diene in this instance is notable as an example of a 1-amino-3-siloxybutadiene, otherwise known as a Rawal diene. center In 1988, William Okamura and Richard Gibbs reported an enantioselective synthesis of (+)-sterpurene that featured a remarkable intramolecular Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction of an allene. The [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the thiophenyl group to give the sulfoxide as below proceeded enantiospecifically due to the predefined stereochemistry of the propargylic alcohol. In this way, the single allene isomer formed could direct the Diels-Alder to occur on only one face of the generated 'diene'. center Andrew Myers' 2005 synthesis of (-)-tetracycline achieved the linear tetracyclic core of the antibiotic with a Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. Thermally initiated, conrotatory opening of the benzocyclobutene generated the o-quinodimethane, which reacted intermolecularly to give the tetracycline skeleton; the diastereomer shown was then crystallized from methanol after purification by column chromatography. The authors note that the dienophile's free hydroxyl group was integral to the success of the reaction, as hydroxyl-protected variants did not react under several different reaction conditions. center Takemura et al. synthesized cantharadrin in 1980 by Diels-Alder, utilizing high pressure. Synthetic applications of the Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction have been reviewed extensively.

SpA (Piaggio ) is an Italian motor vehicle manufacturer, which produces a range of two-wheeled motor vehicles and compact commercial vehicles under seven brands: Piaggio, Vespa, Gilera, Aprilia, Moto Guzzi, Derbi, and Scarabeo. Its corporate headquarters are located in Pontedera, Italy. The company was founded by Rinaldo Piaggio in 1884, initially producing locomotives and railway carriages. Piaggio's subsidiaries employ a total of 7,053 employees and produced a total of 519,700 vehicles in 2014. The manufacturer has six research-and-development centers and operates in over 50 countries. History In 1882, Enrico Piaggio purchased land in Sestri Ponente (Genoa) to set up a timber yard. Two years later, in 1884, his 20-year-old son, Rinaldo Piaggio, founded Piaggio & C. The company initially built locomotives and railway carriages but in 1917, towards the end of World War, Rinaldo Piaggio turned to the military sector. To begin with, the company produced MAS anti-submarine motorboats, aeroplanes and seaplanes under Ansaldo, Macchi, Caproni, and Dornier licenses but later progressed to vehicles constructed according to Piaggio's own drawings. Between 1937 and 1939 Piaggio achieved 21 world records with its aircraft and engines built at the company's new factory in Pontedera, culminating in the four-engine Piaggio P.108 bomber. Rinaldo died in 1938, by which time Piaggio was owned by multiple shareholders within the family, along with the entrepreneur Attilio Odero. Management of the company passed to his sons Enrico and Armando. By 1940 Piaggio was manufacturing trains, nautical fittings, aircraft engines, aeroplanes, trucks, trams, buses, funiculars and aluminium windows and doors. The Pontedera plant was destroyed by Allied bombing and production activities were relocated to the Biella area. After the war, Enrico Piaggio decided to diversify the company's activities outside the aeronautical industry to address a perceived need for a modern, affordable mode of transport for the Italian mass market. The first attempt, based on a small motorcycle made for parachutists, was known as the MP5 and nicknamed the \\"Paperino\\" (the Italian name for Donald Duck) because of its strange shape. Ultimately Enrico Piaggio did not like it and asked Corradino D'Ascanio to redesign it. D'Ascanio, an aeronautical engineer responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by Agusta, was not naturally enthusiastic about motorcycles, judging them to be uncomfortable and bulky, with wheels that were difficult to change after a puncture. When asked to design a motorcycle for Ferdinando Innocenti, D'Ascanio had come up with a step through scooter design but D'Ascanio and Innocenti disagreed over use of pressings rather than tubing so D'Ascanio brought his design to Piaggio. Innocenti would ultimately use D'Ascanio's original design for their Lambretta scooter. Piaggio asked D'Ascanio to create a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. The motorcycle had to be easy to drive for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger, and not get its driver's clothes dirty. The engineer's drawings proved a significant departure from the Paperino. With the help of Mario D'Este he prepared the first Vespa project, manufactured at Piaggio newly-rebuilt Pontedera headquarters in April 1946. Piaggio launched the Vespa (Italian for \\"wasp\\") and within ten years more than a million units had been produced. The Italian language gained a new word, \\"vespare\\", meaning to go somewhere on a Vespa. =Ownership= Vespa in a Todi street Vespa thrived until 1992 when Gianni Agnelli became CEO. Agnelli was already suffering from cancer and died in 2003. In 1999 Morgan Grenfell Private Equity acquired Piaggio, but hopes for a quick sale were dashed by a failed joint venture in China. In Italy, Piaggio invested 15 million euros ($19.4 million) in a new motorcycle but dropped it after building a prototype. By the end of 2002, the company had run up 577 million Euros in debt on revenues of 945 million Euros, and booked a loss of 129 million Euros. In 2003 Piaggio's debt was reduced a 100 million Euro investment made by IMMSI, a holding company of the Colaninno family. 150 million shares were also converted by creditor banks. Reflecting on his investment, Roberto Colaninno said, \\"A lot of people told me I was crazy. Piaggio wasn't dying. It just needed to be treated better.\\"\\" Colannino became the new chairman of Piaggio, while Dr. Rocco Sabelli becoming the managing director. Sabelli redesigned the production line according to Japanese principles so that every Piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line. Contrary to expectations, Mr. Colaninno did not fire a single worker ‚Äì a move which helped seduce the company's skeptical unions. \\"Everyone in a company is part of the value chain,\\" said Colaninno. All bonuses for blue-collar workers and management were based on the same criteria: profit margins and customer satisfaction. Air conditioning was installed in the factory for the first time, increasing productivity. He also gave the company's engineers, who had been idled by the company's financial crisis, deadlines for projects. They rolled out two world firsts in 2004: a gas-electric hybrid scooter and a sophisticated tilting scooter with two wheels in front and one in back to grip the road better. One of Piaggio's problems Mr. Colaninno couldn't fix from the inside was its scale. Even though Piaggio was the European market leader, it was dwarfed by rivals Honda and Yamaha. A year after restoring Piaggio's health, Colaninno directed Piaggio's takeover of the Italian scooter and motorcycle manufacturer Aprilia, and with it the Aprilia-owned Moto Guzzi, a storied Italian manufacturer of motorcycles. In 2006, Piaggio floated on the Milan Stock Exchange, becoming a public company. =Production Development= In 1956, with production of the millionth Vespa scooter, Italy had its first mass-produced motorised vehicle. Taking advantage of increased cash flow thanks to the success of the Vespa, Piaggio developed other products, including the 1957 Vespa 400, a compact passenger car. In 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the Agnelli family, the owners of car maker Fiat SpA. By 1960 Vespa had produced and sold 4 million units worldwide. In 1964 the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions of Piaggio split to become two independent companies as a result of the wide ownership by Fiat in Italian industry. The aeronautical division was named IAM Rinaldo Piaggio. The aircraft company Piaggio Aero was controlled by the family of Piero Ferrari, who still hold 10% of Ferrari. In 1969 Piaggio purchased the motorcycle company Gilera, one of the oldest European motorcycle manufacturers (founded in 1909), famous for its sporting achievements and world titles in the Motorcycle World Championship. In 1971 a steering wheel was added to the Piaggio Ape, a model first produced in 1948, culminating in the Ape Car. Four years later, in 1975, the company made the first prototype of an electric Ape. In 1988 the Vespa reached the milestone of 10 million units produced. In 1996, on the fiftieth anniversary of the first model, Vespa passed 15 million units produced and the new 4-stroke Vespa ET, the first completely new Vespa for 18 years, was launched. Piaggio was still in poor financial health but its brand recognition remained strong, boosted by the appearance of the ET4 in several Hollywood films. In 1999, in Baramati, production began on a three-wheeler Ape for the Indian domestic market. In 2000 Piaggio and Vespa returned to the United States with the opening of the first Vespa Boutique in Los Angeles. In that same year the Piaggio Historical Museum was inaugurated in Pontedera. The museum showcases the Piaggio Historical Archive, one of the most comprehensive company archives on the industrial history of Italy. In 2001 the Piaggio Group acquired Derbi-Nacional Motor SA, an historical Spanish brand founded in 1922 that had won 18 world titles and was a continental leader in the small displacement motorbike segment. In the same year Gilera returned to the Motorcycle World Championship and immediately won the world title in the 125 category with Manuel Poggiali. In 2004, at the end of December, the final contract for the acquisition of the Aprilia-Moto Guzzi Group was signed. The most important European two-wheeler group is born. In 2007 Piaggio Group officially arrives in Vietnam. The Vinh Puch plant includes R&D;, welding and painting activities, as well as final assembly of the scooters, with warehouse, testing, quality control and office areas. In 2009 the Piaggio Mp3 Hybrid makes its debut on the market which was first hybrid scooter in the world, integrating the conventional low-environmental-impact internal combustion engine with a zero-emission electric motor and combining the advantages of the two power trains. In Baramati (State of Maharashtra), in 2012, the Piaggio Group's new plant for the production of Vespa's for the local market was opened. In 2013 the PADC ‚Äì Piaggio Advanced Design Center opened in Pasadena (California, United States). The Vespa 946 was also launched this year, along with the new Vespa Primavera, the latest evolution of the \\"small body\\" family. In 2013 Vespa's worldwide sales numbered almost 190,000 units; in 2004 the figure stood at 58,000. In ten years of continuous progression over 1.3 million new Vespas have reached the streets of the world. Since 1946 over 18 million Vespas have been produced and sold. In September 2017 Foton and Piaggio agreed to form a joint venture to develop and produce light commercial vehicle.Piaggio and Foton joint venture Based on Foton chassis the new vehicle was sold by Piaggio Commercial Vehicle division in Europe and in all markets around the world but not in China. The vehicle is intended to be a successor of the Piaggio Porter and production is planned to start in mid-2019 in Pontedera (Italy) with all components produced by Foton in China.Piaggio Accordo con Foton per il nuovo Porter  \\"Cultural Project\\" Piaggio  Piaggio's \\"cultural project\\" promotes the reconstruction and enhancement of the company's heritage and is composed by three initiatives: the Piaggio Foundation, the Historical Archives and the Piaggio Museum.

Three different versions were sold, the \\"Luxe\\" , \\"Tourisme\\" and \\"GT\\".  Overview  Vespa 400 with fabric roof retracted The car made its high-profile public debut on 26 September 1957 at a press presentation staged in Monaco. The ACMA directors ensured a good attendance from members of the press by also inviting three celebrity racing driversThe famous racing drivers in attendance were Juan Manuel Fangio, Jean Behra and the Monegasque Louis Chiron. to the Vespa 400 launch. The 400 was a two seater with room behind the seats to accommodate luggage or two small children on an optional cushion. The front seats were simple tubular metal frames with cloth upholstery on elastic \\"springs\\" and between the seats were the handbrake, starter and choke. The gear change was centrally floor mounted. The rear hinged doors were coated on the inside with only a thin plastic lining attached to the metal door panel skin allowing valuable extra internal space. On the early cars the main door windows did not open which attracted criticism, but increased the usable width for the driver and passenger. Instrumentation was very basic with only a speedometer and warning lights for low fuel, main beam, dynamo charging and indicators. The cabriolet fabric roof could be rolled back from the windscreen header rail to the top of the rear engine cover leaving conventional metal sides above the doors. The 12 volt battery was located at the front of the car, behind the dummy front grill, on a shelf that could be slid out. The spare wheel was stowed in a well under the passenger seat.  Marketing  The high-profile launch paid off, with 12,130 cars produced in 1958. That turned out to be the high point, however, and output fell to 8,717 in 1959 despite a price reduction for the entry level 2-seater \\"normal\\" coup√© from 345,000 francs to 319,500 francs between October 1957 and October 1958. Commentators suggested that the chic image created at the time of the launch was not always matched by the car itself, with its awkward gear change, poor sound-proofing and, especially before a modification to the carburetor specification, high fuel consumption. The car's origins, developed by a leading world producer of motor scooters, Italy's Piaggio Company, makers of the Vespa since 1946, was reflected in the installation, in the Vespa 400, of a two stroke (motorbike style) engine which required oil to be added to the petrol/gasoline whenever the car was refueled. During the summer of 1958 the cars were fitted with a semi-automatic device for adding oil to the fuel, but a fully automatic fuel mixing device was not included until two years later.  Road test  Vespa 400 dashboard Vespa 400 engine The British Motor magazine tested a 400 de luxe saloon in 1959 recording a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 23.0 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost 351,725 \\"old\\" French Francs, cheaper than the 374,000 \\"old\\" French Francs domestic market starting price quoted towards the end of 1958 for the cheapest version of the larger but (even) less powerful Citroen 2CV.  Specifications  ;Engine: Two cylinder, two stroke, air cooled. Bore, stroke: 63 mm x 63 mm (393 cc). Motor cyclists at the time were used to mixing oil into their fuel, but the manufacturer belatedly realised that this might compromise the 400's standing as a \\"car\\", and from the summer of 1958 \\"two stroke oil\\" was held in separate reservoir with a semi-automatic dispenser on the right side of the engine bay. ;Compression ratio: 6.4:1 with 13 hp, later increased respectively to 6.6:1 and 14 hp. ;Suspension: Four wheel independent. Four double acting hydraulic shock absorbers with coil springs. Front anti-roll bar. ;Manual transmission: 3 speed plus reverse, with 2nd & 3rd synchromesh. 4 speed available in non-U.S. markets. ;Brakes: Hydraulically operated drums of diameter. ;Performance:With only 14 hp (10 kW), top speed is 50 to 55 mph (80 to 90 km/h), depending on road grade, wind conditions, etc. Achieving top speed takes 25 seconds. Fuel economy is about 5L/100 km.

At its peak of power, Goguryeo controlled most of the Korean peninsula, large parts of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East and eastern Mongolia. Along with Baekje and Silla, Goguryeo was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. It was an active participant in the power struggle for control of the Korean peninsula and was also associated with the foreign affairs of neighboring polities in China and Japan. The Samguk sagi, a 12th-century text from Goryeo, indicates that Goguryeo was founded in 37 BC by Jumong (), a prince from Buyeo, who was enthroned as Dongmyeong. Goguryeo was one of the great powers in East Asia, until its defeat by a Silla‚ÄìTang alliance in 668 after prolonged exhaustion and internal strife caused by the death of Yeon Gaesomun. After its fall, its territory was divided among the states of Later Silla and Balhae. The name Goryeo (alternatively spelled Kory≈è), a shortened form of Goguryeo (Kogury≈è), was adopted as the official name in the 5th century, and is the origin of the English name \\"Korea\\". History Goguryeo soldier =Origin= In the geographic monographs of the Book of Han, the word Goguryeo () made its first appearance in 113 BC in the name of Gaogouli County under the jurisdiction of Xuantu Commandery. In the Old Book of Tang (945), it is recorded that Emperor Taizong refers to Goguryeo's history as being some 900 years old. According to the 12th-century Samguk sagi and the 13th-century Samgungnyusa, a prince from the Buyeo kingdom named Jumong fled after a power struggle with other princes of the court and founded Goguryeo in 37 BC in a region called Jolbon Buyeo, usually thought to be located in the middle Yalu and Tongjia River basin, overlapping the current China-North Korea border. In 75 BC, a group of Yemaek who may have originated from Goguryeo made an incursion into China's Xuantu Commandery west of the Yalu. However, the weight of textual evidence from the Old Book of Tang, New Book of Tang, the Samguk sagi, the Nihon Shoki as well as other ancient sources would support a 37 BC or \\"middle\\" first century BC foundation date for Goguryeo. Archaeological evidence would support centralized groups of Yemaek tribes in the 2nd century BC, but there is no direct evidence that would suggest these Yemaek groups were known as or would identify themselves as Goguryeo. The first mention of Goguryeo as a group label associated with Yemaek tribes is a reference in the Han Shu that discusses a Goguryeo revolt in 12 AD, during which they broke away from the influence of the Chinese at Xuantu. At its founding, the Goguryeo people are believed to be a blend of people from Buyeo and Yemaek, as leadership from Buyeo may have fled their kingdom and integrated with existing Yemaek chiefdoms. The Records of the Three Kingdoms, in the section titled \\"Accounts of the Eastern Barbarians\\", implied that Buyeo and the Yemaek people were ethnically related and spoke a similar language. Both Goguryeo and Baekje shared founding myths and originated from Buyeo. =Jumong and the foundation myth= Image of the mythical figure from the Goguryeo-era Ohoe Tomb 4. The earliest mention of Jumong is in the 4th-century Gwanggaeto Stele. Jumong is the modern Korean transcription of the hanja Jumong, Chumo, or Jungmo. The Stele states that Jumong was the first king and ancestor of Goguryeo and that he was the son of the prince of Buyeo and daughter of Habaek (), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak (). The Samguk sagi and Samgungnyusa paint additional detail and names Jumong's mother as Yuhwa (). Jumong's biological father was said to be a man named Haemosu () who is described as a \\"strong man\\" and \\"a heavenly prince.\\"Ilyon, \\"Samguk Yusa\\", Yonsei University Press, p. 45 The river god chased Yuhwa away to the Ubal River () due to her pregnancy, where she met and became the concubine of Geumwa. Jumong was well known for his exceptional archery skills. Eventually, Geumwa's sons became jealous of him, and Jumong was forced to leave Eastern Buyeo.Ilyon, \\"Samguk Yusa\\", p. 46 The Stele and later Korean sources disagree as to which Buyeo Jumong came from. The Stele says he came from Buyeo and the Samgungnyusa and Samguk sagi say he came from Eastern Buyeo. Jumong eventually made it to Jolbon, where he married Soseono, daughter of its ruler. He subsequently became king himself, founding Goguryeo with a small group of his followers from his native country. A traditional account from the \\"Annals of Baekje\\" section in the Samguk sagi says that Soseono was the daughter of Yeon Tabal, a wealthy influential figure in JolbonEncyclopedia of Korean Culture and married to Jumong. However, the same source officially states that the king of Jolbon gave his daughter to Jumong, who had escaped with his followers from Eastern Buyeo, in marriage. She gave her husband, Jumong, financial supportDoosan Encyclopedia Online in founding the new statelet, Goguryeo. After Yuri, son of Jumong and his first wife, Lady Ye, came from Dongbuyeo and succeeded Jumong, she left Goguryeo, taking her two sons Biryu and Onjo south to found their own kingdoms, one of which was Baekje. Jumong's given surname was \\"Hae\\" (), the name of the Buyeo rulers. According to the Samgungnyusa, Jumong changed his surname to \\"Go\\" () in conscious reflection of his divine parentage.Ilyon, \\"Samguk Yusa\\", p. 46‚Äì47 Jumong is recorded to have conquered the tribal states of Biryu () in 36 BC, Haeng-in () in 33 BC, and Northern Okjeo in 28 BC.„Ää‰∏âÂõΩÂè≤ËÆ∞„ÄãÔºö‚ÄúÂÖ≠Âπ¥ ÁßãÂÖ´Êúà Á•ûÈõÄÈõÜÂÆ´Â∫≠ ÂÜ¨ÂçÅÊúà ÁéãÂëΩ‰πå‰ºäÊâ∂Ëä¨Â•¥ ‰ºêÂ§™ÁôΩÂ±±‰∏úÂçó‰∫∫ÂõΩ ÂèñÂÖ∂Âú∞‰∏∫ÂüéÈÇë„ÄÇÂçÅÂπ¥ Áßã‰πùÊúà È∏æÈõÜ‰∫éÁéãÂè∞ ÂÜ¨ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊúà ÁéãÂëΩÊâ∂Â∞â ‰ºêÂåóÊ≤ÉÊ≤ÆÁÅ≠‰πã ‰ª•ÂÖ∂Âú∞‰∏∫ÂüéÈÇë‚Äù =Centralization and early expansion (mid-first century)= Goguryeo developed from a league of various Yemaek tribes to an early state and rapidly expanded its power from their original basin of control in the Hun River drainage. In the time of Taejodae in 53 AD, five local tribes were reorganized into five centrally ruled districts. Foreign relations and the military were controlled by the king. Early expansion might be best explained by ecology; Goguryeo controlled territory in what is currently central and southern Manchuria and northern Korea, which are both very mountainous and lacking in arable land. Upon centralizing, Goguryeo might have been unable to harness enough resources from the region to feed its population and thus, following historical pastoralist tendencies, would have sought to raid and exploit neighboring societies for their land and resources. Aggressive military activities may have also aided expansion, allowing Goguryeo to exact tribute from their tribal neighbors and dominate them politically and economically.'Gina L. Barnes', \\"State Formation in Korea\\", 2001 Curzon Press, page 22' Taejo conquered the Okjeo tribes of what is now northeastern Korea as well as the Dongye and other tribes in Southeastern Manchuria and Northern Korea. From the increase of resources and manpower that these subjugated tribes gave him, Taejodae led Goguryeo in attacking the Han Commanderies of Lelang and Xuantu in the Korean and Liaodong Peninsulas, becoming fully independent from them.'Ki-Baik Lee', \\"A New History of Korea\\", 1984 Harvard University Press, page 24' Generally, Taejodae allowed the conquered tribes to retain their chieftains, but required them to report to governors who were related to Goguryeo's royal line; tribes under Goguryeo's jurisdiction were expected to provide heavy tribute. Taejodae and his successors channeled these increased resources to continuing Goguryeo's expansion to the north and west. New laws regulated peasants and the aristocracy, as tribal leaders continued to be absorbed into the central aristocracy. Royal succession changed from fraternal to patrilineal, stabilizing the royal court.'Ki-Baik Lee', \\"A New History of Korea\\", 1984 Harvard University Press, page 36' The expanding Goguryeo kingdom soon entered into direct military contact with the Liaodong Commandery to its west. Pressure from Liaodong forced Goguryeo to move their capital in the Hun River valley to the Yalu River valley near Hwando.'Gina L. Barnes', \\"State Formation in Korea\\", 2001 Curzon Press, page 22-23' =Goguryeo‚ÄìWei Wars= In the chaos following the fall of the Han Dynasty, the former Han commanderies had broken free of control and were ruled by various independent warlords. Surrounded by these commanderies, who were governed by aggressive warlords, Goguryeo moved to improve relations with the newly created dynasty of Cao Wei in China and sent tribute in 220. In 238, Goguryeo entered into a formal alliance with Wei to destroy the Liaodong commandery. When Liaodong was finally conquered by Wei, cooperation between Wei and Goguryeo fell apart and Goguryeo attacked the western edges of Liaodong, which incited a Wei counterattack in 244. Thus, Goguryeo initiated the Goguryeo‚ÄìWei War in 242, trying to cut off Chinese access to its territories in Korea by attempting to take a Chinese fort. However, the Wei state responded by invading and defeated Goguryeo. The capital at Hwando was destroyed by Wei forces in 244. It is said that Dongcheon, with his army destroyed, fled for a while to the Okjeo state in the east.'Gina L. Barnes', \\"State Formation in Korea\\", 2001 Curzon Press, page 23' Wei invaded again in 259 but was defeated at Yangmaenggok; according to the Samguk sagi, Jungcheon assembled 5,000 elite cavalry and defeated the invading Wei troops, beheading 8,000 enemies. =Revival and further expansion (300 to 390)= buddhas and bodhisattvas from Wono-ri, Goguryeo. A gilt-bronze crown from Goguryeo believed to have once adorned the head of a bodhisattva image. In only 70 years, Goguryeo rebuilt its capital Hwando and again began to raid the Liaodong, Lelang and Xuantu commandaries. As Goguryeo extended its reach into the Liaodong Peninsula, the last Chinese commandery at Lelang was conquered and absorbed by Micheon in 313, bringing the remaining northern part of the Korean peninsula into the fold.'Ki-Baik Lee', \\"A New History of Korea\\", 1984 Harvard University Press, page 20 This conquest resulted in the end of Chinese rule over territory in the northern Korean peninsula, which had spanned 400 years. From that point on, until the 7th century, territorial control of the peninsula would be contested primarily by the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Goguryeo met major setbacks and defeats during the reign of Gogukwon in the 4th century. In the early 4th century, the nomadic proto-Mongol Xianbei people occupied northern China; during the winter of 342, the Xianbei of Former Yan, ruled by the Murong clan, attacked and destroyed Goguryeo's capital, Hwando, capturing 50,000 Goguryeo men and women to use as slave labor in addition to taking the Queen Dowager and Queen prisoner, and forced Gogukwon to flee for a while. The Xianbei also devastated Buyeo in 346, accelerating Buyeo migration to the Korean peninsula. In 371, Geunchogo of Baekje killed Gogukwon in the Battle of Chiyang and sacked Pyongyang, one of Goguryeo's largest cities.Encyclopedia of World History, Vol I, P464 Three Kingdoms, Korea, Edited by Marsha E. Ackermann, Michael J. Schroeder, Janice J. Terry, Jiu-Hwa Lo Upshur, Mark F. Whitters, . Sosurim, who succeeded the slain Gogukwon, reshaped the nation's institutions to save it from a great crisis. Turning to domestic stability and the unification of various conquered tribes, Sosurim proclaimed new laws, embraced Buddhism as the state religion in 372, and established a national educational institute called the Taehak (). Due to the defeats that Goguryeo had suffered at the hands of the Xianbei and Baekje, Sosurim instituted military reforms aimed at preventing such defeats in the future.'William E. Henthorn', \\"A History of Korea\\", 1971 Macmillan Publishing Co., page 34 Sosurim's internal arrangements laid the groundwork for Gwanggaeto's expansion. His successor and the father of Gwanggaeto the Great, Gogukyang, invaded Later Yan, the successor state of Former Yan, in 385 and Baekje in 386. Goguryeo used its military to protect and exploit semi-nomadic peoples, who served as vassals, foot soldiers, or slaves, such as the Okjeo people in the northeast end of the Korean peninsula, and the Mohe people in Manchuria, who would later become the Jurchens. =Zenith of Goguryeo's Power (391 to 531 AD)= Detail of a rubbing of the Gwanggaeto Stele (414 AD), one of the few surviving records made by Goguryeo, written in Classical Chinese. A royal tomb, located in Ji'an, Jilin, was built by the Goguryeo Kingdom. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu. \\"He launched a military expedition to expand his territory, opening the golden age of Goguryeo.\\" During this period, Goguryeo territories included three fourths of the Korean Peninsula, including what is now Seoul, almost all of Manchuria, parts of Inner Mongolia, and parts of Russia. There is archaeological evidence that Goguryeo's maximum extent lay even further west in present-day Mongolia, based on discoveries of Goguryeo fortress ruins in Mongolia. Gwanggaeto the Great (r. 391‚Äì412) was a highly energetic emperor who is remembered for his rapid military expansion of the realm. He instituted the era name of Yeongnak or Eternal Rejoicing, affirming that Goguryeo was on equal standing with the dynasties in the Chinese mainland. Gwanggaeto conquered 64 walled cities and 1,400 villages during his campaigns.Szczepanski, Kallie. (2011). Inscription from Gwanggaeto the Great's Stele Retrieved from September 18, 2011, from To the west, he destroyed neighboring Khitan tribes and invaded Later Yan, conquering the entire Liaodong Peninsula; to the north and east, he annexed much of Buyeo and conquered the Sushen, who were Tungusic ancestors of the Jurchens and Manchus; and to the south, he defeated and subjugated Baekje, contributed to the dissolution of Gaya, and vassalized Silla after defending it from a coalition of Baekje, Gaya, and Wa. Gwanggaeto brought about a loose unification of the Korean Peninsula, and achieved undisputed control of most of Manchuria and over two thirds of the Korean Peninsula. Gwanggaeto's exploits were recorded on a huge memorial stele erected by his son Jangsu, located in present-day Ji'an on the border between China and North Korea. Jangsu (r. 413‚Äì491) ascended to the throne in 413 and moved the capital in 427 to Pyongyang, a more suitable region to grow into a burgeoning metropolitan capital, \\"This move from a region of narrow mountain valleys to a broad riverine plain indicates that the capital could no longer remain primarily a military encampment but had to be developed into a metropolitan center for the nation's political, economic, and social life.\\" which led Goguryeo to achieve a high level of cultural and economic prosperity. \\"Because Pyongyang was located in the vast, fertile Taedong River basin and had been the center of advanced culture of Old Chos≈èn and Nangnang, this move led Kogury≈è to attain a high level of economic and cultural prosperity.\\" Jangsu, like his father, continued Goguryeo's territorial expansion into Manchuria and reached the Songhua River to the north. He invaded the Khitans, and then attacked the Didouyu, located in eastern Mongolia, with his Rouran allies. Like his father, Jangsu also achieved a loose unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He defeated Baekje and Silla and gained large amounts of territory from both. In addition, Jangsu's long reign saw the perfecting of Goguryeo's political, economic and other institutional arrangements. Jangsu ruled Goguryeo for 79 years until the age of 98, the longest reign in East Asian history. During the reign of Munja, Goguryeo completely annexed Buyeo, signifying Goguryeo's furthest-ever expansion north, while continuing its strong influence over the kingdoms of Silla and Baekje, and the tribes of Wuji and Khitan. =Internal strife (531 to 551)= Goguryeo reached its zenith in the 6th century. After this, however, it began a steady decline. Anjang was assassinated, and succeeded by his brother Anwon, during whose reign aristocratic factionalism increased. A political schism deepened as two factions advocated different princes for succession, until the eight-year-old Yang-won was finally crowned. But the power struggle was never resolved definitively, as renegade magistrates with private armies appointed themselves de facto rulers of their areas of control. Taking advantage of Goguryeo's internal struggle, a nomadic group called the Tuchueh attacked Goguryeo's northern castles in the 550s and conquered some of Goguryeo's northern lands. Weakening Goguryeo even more, as civil war continued among feudal lords over royal succession, Baekje and Silla allied to attack Goguryeo from the south in 551. =Conflicts of the late 6th and 7th centuries= In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, Goguryeo was often in military conflict with the Sui and Tang dynasties of China. Its relations with Baekje and Silla were complex and alternated between alliances and enmity. A neighbor in the northwest were the Eastern G√∂kt√ºrk which was a nominal ally of Goguryeo. Goguryeo's loss of the Han River Valley In 551 AD, Baekje and Silla entered into an alliance to attack Goguryeo and conquer the Han River valley, an important strategic area close to the center of the peninsula and a very rich agricultural region. After Baekje exhausted themselves with a series of costly assaults on Goguryeo fortifications, Silla troops, arriving on the pretense of offering assistance, attacked and took possession of the entire Han River valley in 553. Incensed by this betrayal, Seong launched a retaliatory strike against Silla's western border in the following year but was captured and killed. The war, along the middle of the Korean peninsula, had very important consequences. It effectively made Baekje the weakest player on the Korean Peninsula and gave Silla an important resource and population rich area as a base for expansion. Conversely, it denied Goguryeo the use of the area, which weakened the kingdom. It also gave Silla direct access to the Yellow Sea, opening up direct trade and diplomatic access to the Chinese dynasties and accelerating Silla's adoption of Chinese culture. Thus, Silla could rely less on Goguryeo for elements of civilization and could get culture and technology directly from China. This increasing tilt of Silla to China would result in an alliance that would prove disastrous for Goguryeo in the late 7th century. Goguryeo‚ÄìSui War Goguryeo's expansion conflicted with Sui China and increased tensions. In 598, Goguryeo made a preemptive attack on Liaoxi, leading Emperor Wen to launch a counterattack by land and sea that ended in disaster for Sui. Sui's most disastrous campaign against Goguryeo was in 612, in which Sui, according to the History of the Sui Dynasty, mobilized 30 Division armies, about 1,133,800 combat troops. Pinned along Goguryeo's line of fortifications on the Liao River, a detachment of nine division armies, about 305,000 troops, bypassed the main defensive lines and headed towards the Goguryeo capital of Pyongyang to link up with Sui naval forces, who had reinforcements and supplies. However, Goguryeo was able to defeat the Sui navy, thus when the Sui's nine division armies finally reached Pyongyang, they didn't have the supplies for a lengthy siege. Sui troops retreated, but General Eulji Mundeok led the Goguryeo troops to victory by luring the Sui into an ambush outside of Pyongyang. At the Battle of Salsu, Goguryeo soldiers released water from a dam, which split the Sui army and cut off their escape route. Of the original 305,000 soldiers of Sui's nine division armies, it is said that only 2,700 escaped to Sui China. The 613 and 614 campaigns were aborted after launch‚Äîthe 613 campaign was terminated when the Sui general Yang Xuangan rebelled against Emperor Yang, while the 614 campaign was terminated after Goguryeo offered a truce and returned Husi Zheng (ÊñõÊñØÊîø), a defecting Sui general who had fled to Goguryeo, Emperor Yang later had Husi executed. Emperor Yang planned another attack on Goguryeo in 615, but due to Sui's deteroriating internal state he was never able to launch it. Sui was weakened due to rebellions against Emperor Yang's rule and his failed attempts to conquer Goguryeo. They could not attack further because the provinces in the Sui heartland would not send logistical support. Emperor Yang's disastrous defeats in Korea greatly contributed to the collapse of the Sui dynasty. Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War and the Silla‚ÄìTang alliance First campaign in the Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War. In the winter of 642, King Yeongnyu was apprehensive about Yeon Gaesomun, one of the great nobles of Goguryeo, and plotted with other officials to kill him. However, Yeon Gaesomun caught news of the plot and killed Yeongnyu and 100 officials, initiating a coup d'√©tat. He proceeded to enthrone Yeongnyu's nephew, Go Jang, as King Bojang while wielding de facto control of Goguryeo himself as the generalissimo (). Yeon Gaesomun took an increasingly provocative stance against Silla and Tang China. In 643, under pressure from the Goguryeo‚ÄìBaekje alliance, Silla requested military aid from Tang. In 644, Tang began preparations for a major campaign against Goguryeo. In 645, Emperor Taizong, who had a personal ambition to defeat Goguryeo and was determined to succeed where Emperor Yang had failed, personally led an attack on Goguryeo. The Tang army captured a number of Goguryeo fortresses, including the important Yodong/Liaodong Fortress (ÈÅºÊù±Âüé, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning), and defeated large Goguryeo armies in its path. Ansi City (in modern Haicheng, Liaoning) was the last fortress that would clear the Liaodong Peninsula of significant defensive works and was promptly put under siege. However, the capable defense put up by Ansi's commanding general (whose name is controversial but traditionally is believed to be Yang Manchun) stymied Tang forces and, in late fall, with winter fast approaching and his supplies running low, Emperor Taizong withdrew. The campaign was unsuccessful for the Tang Chinese, failing to capture Ansi Fortress after a protracted siege that lasted more than 60 days. Emperor Taizong invaded Goguryeo again in 647 and 648, but was defeated both times. Emperor Taizong prepared another invasion in 649, but died in the summer, possibly due to an illness he contracted during his Korean campaigns. His son Emperor Gaozong continued his campaigns. Upon the suggestion of Kim Chunchu, the Silla‚ÄìTang alliance first conquered Baekje in 660 to break up the Goguryeo‚ÄìBaekje alliance, and then turned its full attention to Goguryeo. However, Emperor Gaozong, too, was unable to defeat Goguryeo led by Yeon Gaesomun; one of Yeon Gaesomun's most notable victories came in 662 at the Battle of Sasu (ËõáÊ∞¥), where he annihilated the Tang forces and killed the invading general Pang Xiaotai (ÈæêÂ≠ùÊ≥∞) and all 13 of his sons. Therefore, while Yeon Gaesomun was alive, Tang could not defeat Goguryeo. Fall In the summer of 666, Yeon Gaesomun died of a natural cause and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother. He was initially succeeded as Dae Mangniji, the highest position newly made under the ruling period of Yeon Gaesomun, by his oldest son Yeon Namsaeng. As Yeon Namsaeng subsequently carried out a tour of Goguryeo territory, however, rumors began to spread both that Yeon Namsaeng was going to kill his younger brothers Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan, whom he had left in charge at Pyongyang, and that Yeon Namgeon and Yeon Namsan were planning to rebel against Yeon Namsaeng. When Yeon Namsaeng subsequently sent officials close to him back to Pyongyang to try to spy on the situation, Yeon Namgeon arrested them and declared himself Dae Mangniji, attacking his brother. Yeon Namsaeng sent his son Cheon Heonseong (Ê≥âÁçªË™†), as Yeon Namsaeng changed his family name from Yeon (Ê∑µ) to Cheon (Ê≥â) observe naming taboo for Emperor Gaozu, to Tang to seek aid. Emperor Gaozong saw this as an opportunity and sent an army to attack and destroy Goguryeo. In the middle of Goguryeo's power struggles between Yeon Gaesomun's successors, his younger brother, Yeon Jeongto, defected to the Silla side. In 667, the Chinese army crossed the Liao River and captured Shin/Xin Fortress (Êñ∞Âüé, in modern Fushun, Liaoning). The Tang forces thereafter fought off counterattacks by Yeon Namgeon, and joined forces with and received every possible assistance from the defector Yeon Namsaeng, although they were initially unable to cross the Yalu River due to resistance. In spring of 668, Li Ji turned his attention to Goguryeo's northern cities, capturing the important city of Buyeo (Êâ∂È§ò, in modern Nong'an, Jilin). In fall of 668, he crossed the Yalu River and put Pyongyang under siege in concert with the Silla army. Yeon Namsan and Bojang surrendered, and while Yeon Namgeon continued to resist in the inner city, his general, the Buddhist monk Shin Seong (‰ø°Ë™†) turned against him and surrendered the inner city to Tang forces. Yeon Namgeon tried to commit suicide, but was seized and treated. This was the end of Goguryeo, and Tang annexed Goguryeo into its territory, with Xue Rengui being put initially in charge of former Goguryeo territory as protector general. The violent dissension resulting from Yeon Gaesomun's death proved to be the primary reason for the Tang‚ÄìSilla triumph, thanks to the division, defections, and widespread demoralization it caused. The alliance with Silla had also proved to be invaluable, thanks to the ability to attack Goguryeo from opposite directions, and both military and logistical aid from Silla. However, there was much resistance to Tang rule (fanned by Silla, which was displeased that Tang did not give it Goguryeo or Baekje's territory), and in 669, following Emperor Gaozong's order, a part of the Goguryeo people were forced to move to the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River, as well as the regions south of the Qinling Mountains and west of Chang'an, only leaving old and weak inhabitants in the original land. Some people entered the service of the Tang government, such as Go Sagye and his son Gao Xianzhi (Go Seonji in Korean), the famed general who commanded the Tang forces at the Battle of Talas. Silla thus unified most of the Korean peninsula in 668, but the kingdom's reliance on China's Tang Dynasty had its price. Tang set up the Protectorate General to Pacify the East, governed by Xue Rengui, but faced increasing problems ruling the former inhabitants of Goguryeo, as well as Silla's resistance to Tang's remaining presence on the Korean Peninsula. Silla had to forcibly resist the imposition of Chinese rule over the entire peninsula, which lead to the Silla‚ÄìTang Wars, but their own strength did not extend beyond the Taedong River. Revival movements After the fall of Goguryeo in 668, many Goguryeo people rebelled against the Tang and Silla by starting Goguryeo revival movements. Among these were Geom Mojam, Dae Jung- sang, and several famous generals. The Tang Dynasty tried but failed to establish several commanderies to rule over the area. In 677, Tang crowned Bojang as the \\"King of Joseon\\" and put him in charge of the Liaodong commandery of the Protectorate General to Pacify the East. However, Bojang continued to foment rebellions against Tang in an attempt to revive Goguryeo, organizing Goguryeo refugees and allying with the Mohe tribes. He was eventually exiled to Sichuan in 681, and died the following year. The Protectorate General to Pacify the East was installed by the Tang government to rule and keep control over the former territories of the fallen Goguryeo. It was first put under the control of Tang General Xue Rengui, but was later replaced by Bojang due to the negative responses of the Goguryeo people. Bojang was sent into exile for assisting Goguryeo revival movements, but was succeeded by his descendants. Bojang's descendants declared independence from Tang during the same period as the An Lushan Rebellion and Li Zhengji (Yi Jeong-gi in Korean)'s rebellion in Shandong.„ÄäË≥áÊ≤ªÈÄöÈëë¬∑ÂîêÁ¥ÄÂõõÂçÅ‰∏Ä„Äã„ÄäË≥áÊ≤ªÈÄöÈëë¬∑ÂîêÁ¥ÄÂõõÂçÅ‰∏â„Äã The Protectorate General to Pacify the East was renamed \\"Little Goguryeo\\" until its eventual absorption into Balhae under the reign of Seon. Geom Mojam and Anseung rose briefly at the Han Fortress (ÌïúÏÑ±, Êº¢Âüé, in modern Chaeryong, South Hwanghae), but failed, when Anseung surrendered to Silla. Go Anseung ordered the assassination of Geom Mojam, and defected to Silla, where he was given a small amount of land to rule over. There, Anseung established the State of Bodeok (Î≥¥Îçï, Â†±Âæ∑), incited a rebellion, which was promptly crushed by Sinmun. Anseung was then forced to reside in the Silla capital, given a Silla bride and had to adopt the Silla Royal surname of \\"Kim.\\" Dae Jung-sang and his son Dae Jo-yeong, both former Goguryeo generals, regained most of Goguryeo's northern land after its downfall in 668, established the Kingdom of Jin (ÏßÑ, Èúá), which was renamed to Balhae after 713. To the south of Balhae, Silla controlled the Korean peninsula south of the Taedong River, and Manchuria (present-day northeastern China) was conquered by Balhae. Balhae considered itself (particularly in diplomatic correspondence with Japan) a successor state of Goguryeo. In 901, the general Gung Ye rebelled against Later Silla and founded Later Goguryeo (renamed to Taebong in 911), which considered itself to be a successor of Goguryeo. Later Goguryeo originated in the northern regions, including Songak (modern Kaesong), which were the strongholds of Goguryeo refugees. Later Goguryeo's original capital was established in Songak, the hometown of Wang Geon, a prominent general under Gung Ye. Wang Geon was a descendant of Goguryeo and traced his ancestry to a noble Goguryeo clan. In 918, Wang Geon overthrew Gung Ye and established Goryeo, as the successor of Goguryeo, and laid claim to Manchuria as Goryeo's rightful legacy. Wang Geon unified the Later Three Kingdoms in 936, and Goryeo ruled the Korean Peninsula until 1392. In the 10th century, Balhae collapsed and much of its ruling class and the last crown prince Dae Gwang-hyeon fled to Goryeo. The Balhae refugees were warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, who felt a strong familial kinship with Balhae, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo. \\"When Parhae perished at the hands of the Khitan around this same time, much of its ruling class, who were of Kogury≈è descent, fled to Kory≈è. Wang K≈èn warmly welcomed them and generously gave them land. Along with bestowing the name Wang Kye (\\"Successor of the Royal Wang\\") on the Parhae crown prince, Tae Kwang-hy≈èn, Wang K≈èn entered his name in the royal household register, thus clearly conveying the idea that they belonged to the same lineage, and also had rituals performed in honor of his progenitor. Thus Kory≈è achieved a true national unification that embraced not only the Later Three Kingdoms but even survivors of Kogury≈è lineage from the Parhae kingdom.\\" Military Goguryeo was a highly militaristic state. Goguryeo has been described as an empire by Korean scholars. Initially, there were four partially autonomous districts based on the cardinal directions, and a central district led by the monarch; however, in the first century the cardinal districts became centralized and administrated by the central district, and by the end of the 3rd century, they lost all political and military authority to the monarch. In the 4th century, after suffering defeats against the Xianbei and Baekje during the reign of Gogukwon, Sosurim instituted military reforms that paved the way for Gwanggaeto's conquests. During its height, Goguryeo was able to mobilize 300,000 troops. Goguryeo often enlisted semi-nomadic vassals, such as the Mohe people, as foot soldiers. Every man in Goguryeo was required to serve in the military, or could avoid conscription by paying extra grain tax. A Tang treatise of 668 records a total of 675,000 displaced personnel and 176 military garrisons after the surrender of Bojang. =Equipment= The main projectile weapon used in Goguryeo was the bow.http://news.donga.com/List/Series_70040100000145/3/70040100000145/20140401/62155239/1 The bows were modified to be more composite and increase throwing ability on par with crossbows. To a lesser extent, stone-throwing machines and crossbows were also used. Polearms, used against the cavalry and in open order, were mostly spears. Two types of swords were used by Goguryeo warriors. The first was a shorter double-edged variant mostly used for throwing. The other was longer single-edged sword with minimal hilt and ring pommel, of eastern Han influence. The helmets were similar to helmets used by Central Asian peoples, decorated with wings, leathers and horsetails. The shield was the main protection, which covered most of the soldier's body. The cavalry were called Gaemamusa (Í∞úÎßàÎ¨¥ÏÇ¨, ÈéßÈ¶¨Ê≠¶Â£´), and similar in type to the Cataphract. Hwandudaedo HwandudaedoGoguryeo used a sword called Hwandudaedo.http://www.heritage.go.kr/heri/cul/culSelectDetail.do?VdkVgwKey=12,07760000,11It looks like the sword drawing in the following picture which is 2000 years old from an old Goguryeo tomb. As Korean swords changed from Bronze Age to Iron Age, the sword shapes changed. There are many archaeological finds on ancient Korean iron swords particularly the swords with a ring at the end. =Fortifications= The most common form of the Goguryeo fortress was one made in the shape of the moon, located between a river and its tributary. Ditches and ground walls between the shores formed an extra defense line. The walls were extensive in their length, and they were constructed from huge stone blocks fixed with clay, and even Chinese artillery had difficulty to break through them. Walls were surrounded by a ditch to prevent an underground attack, and equipped with guard towers. All fortresses had sources of water and enough equipment for a protracted siege. If rivers and mountains were absent, extra defense lines were added. =Organization= Two hunts per year, led by the king himself, maneuvers exercises, hunt-maneuvers and parades were conducted to give the Goguryeo soldier a high level of individual training. There were five armies in the capital, mostly cavalry that were personally led by the king, numbering approximately 12,500. Military units varied in number from 21,000 to 36,000 soldiers, were located in the provinces, and were led by the governors. Military colonies near the boundaries consisted mostly of soldiers and peasants. There were also private armies held by aristocrats. This system allowed Goguryeo to maintain and utilize an army of 50,000 without added expense, and 300,000 through large mobilization in special cases. Goguryeo units were divided according to major weapons: spearmen, axemen, archers composed of those on foot and horseback, and heavy cavalry that included armored and heavy spear divisions. Other groups like the catapult units, wall-climbers, and storm units were part of the special units and were added to the common. The advantage of this functional division is highly specialized combat units, while the disadvantage is that it was impossible for one unit to make complex, tactical actions. =Strategy= The military formation had the general and his staff with guards in the middle of the army. The archers were defended by axemen. In front of the general were the main infantry forces, and on the flanks were rows of heavy cavalry ready to counterattack in case of a flank attack by the enemy. In the very front and rear was the light cavalry, used for intelligence, pursuit, and for weakening the enemy's strike. Around the main troops were small groups of heavy cavalrymen and infantry. Each unit was prepared to defend the other by providing mutual support. Goguryeo implemented a strategy of active defense based on cities. Besides the walled cities and fortified camps, this active defense system used small units of light cavalry to continuously harass the enemy, de-blockade units and strong reserves, consisting of the best soldiers, to strike hard at the end. Goguryeo also employed military intelligence and special tactics as an important part of the strategy. Goguryeo was good at disinformation, such as sending only stone spearheads as tribute to the Chinese court when they were in the Iron Age. Goguryeo had developed its system of espionage. One of the most famous spies, Baekseok, mentioned in the Samguk yusa, was able to infiltrate the Hwarangs of Silla. Foreign relations The militaristic nature of Goguryeo frequently drew them into conflicts with the dynasties of China. In the times when they are not in war with China, Goguryeo occasionally sent tributes to some of the Chinese dynasties as a form of trade and nonaggression pact. These activities of exchange promoted cultural and religious flow from China into the Korean peninsula. Goguryeo has also received tribute from other Korean kingdoms and neighboring tribal states, and frequently mobilized Malgal people in their military. Baekje and Goguryeo maintained their regional rivalry throughout their history, although they eventually formed an alliance in their wars against Silla and Tang. Culture Goguryeo roof-tile The culture of Goguryeo was shaped by its climate, religion, and the tense society that people dealt with due to the numerous wars Goguryeo waged. Not much is known about Goguryeo culture, as many records have been lost. =Lifestyle= The inhabitants of Goguryeo wore a predecessor of the modern hanbok, just as the other cultures of the three kingdoms. There are murals and artifacts that depict dancers wearing elaborate white dresses. =Festivals and pastimes= Common pastimes among Goguryeo people were drinking, singing, or dancing. Games such as wrestling attracted curious spectators. Every October, the Dongmaeng Festival was held. The Dongmaeng Festival was practiced to worship the gods. The ceremonies were followed by huge celebratory feasts, games, and other activities. Often, the king performed rites to his ancestors. Hunting was a male activity and also served as an appropriate means to train young men for the military. Hunting parties rode on horses and hunted deer and other game with bows-and-arrows. Archery contests also occurred. = Religion = A Goguryeo tomb mural. three-legged bird in a Goguryeo tomb. Goguryeo people worshipped ancestors and considered them to be supernatural. Jumong, the founder of Goguryeo, was worshipped and respected among the people. There was even a temple in Pyongyang dedicated to Jumong. At the annual Dongmaeng Festival, a religious rite was performed for Jumong, ancestors, and gods. Mythical beasts and animals were also considered to be sacred in Goguryeo. The phoenix and dragon were both worshipped, while the Samjogo, the three-legged crow that represented the sun, was considered the most powerful of the three. Paintings of mythical beasts exist in Goguryeo king tombs today. They also believed in the 'Sasin', who were 4 mythical animals. Chungryong or Chunryonga (blue dragon) guarded the east, baek-ho (white tiger) guarded the west, jujak (red phoenix (bird)) guarded the south, and hyunmu (black turtle (sometimes with snakes for a tail)) guarded the north. These mythical animals are similar to the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise of the Four Symbols. Buddhism was first introduced to Goguryeo in 372. The government recognized and encouraged the teachings of Buddhism and many monasteries and shrines were created during Goguryeo's rule, making Goguryeo the first kingdom in the region to adopt Buddhism. However, Buddhism was much more popular in Silla and Baekje, which Goguryeo passed Buddhism to. Ssireum depicted on Goguryeo mural =Cultural linkage= Goguryeo art, preserved largely in tomb paintings, is noted for the vigour of its imagery. Fine detail can be seen in Goguryeo tombs and other murals. Many of the art pieces has an original style of painting. Cultural legacies of Goguryeo may be found in modern Korean culture, for example: Korean fortress, ssireum,History of Ssireum, Korea Ssireum Research Institute taekkyeon,Historical Background Of Taekwondo Korea Taekwondo AssociationThe Origin of Taekwondo, The World Taekwondo Federation Korean dance, ondol (Goguryeo's floor heating system) and the hanbok.Brown 2006, p. 18 Legacy Remains of walled towns, fortresses, palaces, tombs, and artifacts have been found in North Korea and Manchuria, including ancient paintings in a Goguryeo tomb complex in Pyongyang. Some ruins are also still visible in present-day China, for example at Wun√º Mountain, suspected to be the site of Jolbon fortress, near Huanren in Liaoning province on the present border with North Korea. Ji'an is also home to a large collection of Goguryeo era tombs, including what Chinese scholars consider to be the tombs of Gwanggaeto and his son Jangsu, as well as perhaps the best-known Goguryeo artifact, the Gwanggaeto Stele, which is one of the primary sources for pre-5th-century Goguryeo history. =World Heritage Site= UNESCO added Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom in present-day China and Complex of Goguryeo Tombs in present-day North Korea to the World Heritage Sites in 2004. =Name= The modern English name \\"Korea\\" derives from Goryeo (also spelled as Kory≈è) (918‚Äì1392), which regarded itself as the legitimate successor of Goguryeo. The name Goryeo was first used during the reign of Jangsu in the 5th century. Goguryeo is also referred to as Goryeo after 520 AD in Chinese and Japanese historical and diplomatic sources.  Language  There have been some academic attempts to reconstruct the Goguryeo words based on the fragments of toponyms, recorded in the Samguk sagi, of the areas once possessed by Goguryeo. However, the reliability of the toponyms as linguistic evidence is still in dispute.https://web.archive.org/web/20090226195328/http://www.historyfoundation.or.kr/Data/DataGarden/Journal%2802-2%29%282%29.pdf Most linguistic experts on Goguryeo agree that Goguryeo was a member of the Koreanic language family. Chinese records suggest that the languages of Goguryeo, Buyeo, East Okjeo, and Gojoseon were similar, while they differed from that of the Tungusic-Malgal (Mohe).Fan Ye, Book of the Later Han, volume 85; the Dongyi LiezhuanWei Shou, Book of Wei, volume 100; the Liezhuan 88, the WujiLi Dashi, History of Northern Dynasties, volume 94; the Liezhuan 82, the Wuji Controversies Goguryeo was traditionally viewed in China as a Korean kingdom, but in modern times, the government of the People's Republic of China began to claim Goguryeo as a part of the Chinese empire rather than an independent Korean kingdom. This received heated criticisms from Korean scholars, Goguryeo experts from various countries and also some moderate Chinese scholars. Both South Korea and North Korea officially condemned China's attempt to rewrite the history of Northeast-Asia. Online discussion regarding this topic has increased. The Internet has provided a platform for a broadening participation in the discussion of Goguryeo in both South Korea and China. Thomas Chase points out that despite the growing online discussion on this subject, this has not led to a more objective treatment of this history, nor a more critical evaluation of its relationship to national identity.

B. and Dominikus Zimmermann, the latter of whom lived nearby for the last eleven years of his life. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim- Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany. It is said that, in 1738, tears were seen on a dilapidated wooden figure of the Scourged Saviour. The legend of this miracle resulted in a pilgrimage rush to see the sculpture. In 1740, a small chapel was built to house the statue but it was soon realized that the building would be too small for the number of pilgrims it attracted, and so Steingaden Abbey decided to commission a separate shrine. Many who have prayed in front of the statue of Jesus on the altar have claimed that people have been miraculously cured of their diseases, which has made this church even more of a pilgrimage site. Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. \\"Everything was done throughout the church to make the supernatural visible. Sculpture and murals combined to unleash the divine in visible form\\". There is a popular belief that the Bavarian government planned to sell or demolish the rococo masterpiece during the secularization of Bavaria at the beginning of the 19th century, and that only protests from the local farmers saved it from destruction. Available sources, however, document that the responsible state commission clearly advocated the continuation of Wies as a pilgrimage site, even in spite of economic objections from the abbot of Steingaden. The Wieskirche was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983 and underwent extensive restoration between 1985 and 1991. The rococo interior of the church is famous for its frothy trompe-l'oeil plafond.

Alfred Watkins believed a ley line passed along their ridge. Ley lines () refer to straight alignments drawn between various historic structures and prominent landmarks. The idea was developed in early 20th-century Europe, with ley line believers arguing that these alignments were recognised by ancient European societies which deliberately erected structures along them. Since the 1960s, members of the Earth Mysteries movement and other esoteric traditions have commonly believed that such ley lines demarcate \\"earth energies\\" and serve as guides for alien spacecraft. Archaeologists and scientists regard ley lines as an example of pseudo-archaeology and pseudo-science. The idea of \\"leys\\" as straight tracks across the landscape was put forward by the English antiquarian Alfred Watkins in the 1920s, particularly in his book The Old Straight Track. He argued that straight lines could be drawn between various historic structures and that these represented trade routes created by ancient British societies. Although he gained a small following, Watkins' ideas were never accepted by the British archaeological establishment, a fact that frustrated him. His critics noted that his ideas relied on drawing lines between sites established at different periods of the past. They also argued that in prehistory, as in the present, it was impractical to travel in a straight line across hilly or mountainous areas of Britain, rendering his leys unlikely as trade routes. Independently of Watkins' ideas, a similar notion‚Äîthat of Heilige Linien ('holy lines')‚Äîwas raised in 1920s Germany. It was later endorsed by various Nazis. During the 1960s, Watkins' ideas were revived in altered form by British proponents of the countercultural Earth Mysteries movement. In 1961, Tony Wedd put forward the belief that leys were established by prehistoric communities to guide alien spacecraft. This view was promoted to a wider audience in the books of John Michell, particularly his 1969 work The View Over Atlantis. Michell's publications were accompanied by the launch of the Ley Hunter magazine and the appearance of a ley hunter community keen to identify ley lines across the British landscape. Ley hunters often combined their search for ley lines with other esoteric practices like dowsing and numerology and with a belief in a forthcoming Age of Aquarius that would transform human society. Although often hostile to archaeologists, some ley hunters attempted to ascertain scientific evidence for their belief in earth energies at prehistoric sites, evidence they could not obtain. Following sustained archaeological criticism, the ley hunter community dissipated in the 1990s, with several of its key proponents abandoning the idea and moving into the study of landscape archaeology and folkloristics. Belief in ley lines nevertheless remains common among some esoteric religious groups, such as forms of modern Paganism, in both Europe and North America. Archaeologists note that there is no evidence that ley lines were a recognised phenomenon among ancient European societies and that attempts to draw them typically rely on linking together structures that were built in different historical periods. Archaeologists and statisticians have demonstrated that a random distribution of a sufficient number of points on a plane will inevitably create alignments of random points purely by chance. Skeptics have also stressed that the esoteric idea of earth energies running through ley lines has not been scientifically verified, remaining an article of faith for its believers. History =Early prototypes= The idea that ancient sacred sites might have been constructed in alignment with one another was proposed in 1846 by the Reverend Edward Duke, who observed that some prehistoric monuments and medieval churches aligned with each other. In 1909, the idea was advanced in Germany. There, Wilhelm Teudt had argued for the presence of linear alignments connecting various sites but suggested that they had a religious and astronomical function. In Germany, the idea was referred to as Heilige Linien ('holy lines'). This idea was adopted by some proponents of Nazism. =Alfred Watkins and The Old Straight Track= Alfred Watkins' map of two putative ley lines The idea of \\"leys\\" as paths traversing the British landscape was developed by Alfred Watkins, a wealthy businessman and antiquarian who lived in Hereford. According to his account, he was driving across the hills near Blackwardine, Herefordshire, when he looked across the landscape and observed the way that several features lined up together. He subsequently began drawing lines across his Ordnance Survey maps, developing the view that ancient British people had tended to travel in straight lines, using \\"mark points\\" along the landscape to guide them. He put forward his idea of ley lines in the 1922 book Early British Trackways and then again, in greater depth, in the 1925 book The Old Straight Track. He proposed the existence of a network of completely straight roads that cut through a range of prehistoric, Roman, and medieval structures. In his view, these straight tracks were ancient trade routes. Watkins had drawn upon earlier research; he cited the work of the English astronomer Norman Lockyer, who had argued that ancient alignments might be oriented to sunrise and sunset at solstices. His work referred to G. H. Piper's paper presented to the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Clubb in 1882, which noted that: \\"A line drawn from the Skirrid-fawr mountain northwards to Arthur's Stone would pass over the camp and southernmost point of Hatterall Hill, Oldcastle, Longtown Castle, and Urishay and Snodhill castles.\\"Piper, G.H. (1888). Arthur's Stone, Dorstone. Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club 1881‚Äì82: 175‚Äì80. Watkins referred to these lines as \\"leys\\" although had reservations about doing so. The term ley derived from the Old English term for a cleared space, with Watkins adopting it for his lines because he found it to be part of the place- names of various settlements that were along the lines he traced. He also observed the recurrence of \\"cole\\" and \\"dod\\" in English place-names, thus suggesting that the individuals who established these lines were referred to as a \\"coleman\\" or \\"dodman\\". He proposed that the Long Man of Wilmington chalk geoglyph in Sussex was a depiction of such an individual with their measuring equipment. Watkins believed that the Long Man of Wilmington in Sussex depicted a prehistoric \\"dodman\\" with his equipment for determining a ley line His ideas were rejected by most experts on British prehistory at the time, including both the small number of recognised archaeological scholars and local enthusiasts. His critics noted that the straight lines he proposed would have been highly impractical means of crossing hilly or mountainous terrain, and that many of the sites he selected as evidence for the leys were of disparate historical origins. Some of Watkins' other ideas, such as his belief that widespread forest clearance took place in prehistory rather than later, would nevertheless later be recognised by archaeologists. Part of archaeologists' objections was their belief that prehistoric Britons would not have been sophisticated enough to produce such accurate measurements across the landscape. British archaeologists were then overwhelmingly committed to ideas of cultural diffusionism, and thus unwelcoming to ideas about ley lines being an independent British development. In 1926, advocates of Watkins' beliefs established the Straight Track Club. In 1927, Watkins published The Ley Hunter's Manual to assist this growing body of enthusiasts who were looking for their own ley lines in the landscape. Proponents of Watkins' ideas sent in letters to the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then editor of the Antiquity journal. Crawford filed these letters under a section of his archive titled \\"Crankeries\\" and was annoyed that educated people believed such ideas when they were demonstrably incorrect. He refused to publish an advert in Antiquity for The Old Straight Track, at which Watkins became very bitter towards him. Watkins' last book, Archaic Tracks Around Cambridge, was published in 1932. Watkins died on 7 April 1935. The Club survived him, although became largely inactive at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and formally disbanded in 1948. The archaeoastronomer Clive Ruggles noted that after the 1920s, \\"ley lines soon faded into obscurity\\". The historian Ronald Hutton similarly noted that there had been a \\"virtual demise\\" in the idea by the 1950s, in part due to \\"a natural weariness with a spent enthusiasm\\". =Earth Mysteries movement= In the 1960s, John Michell (pictured in 2008) played a major role in promoting a belief in ley lines From the 1940s through to the 1960s, the archaeological establishment blossomed in Britain as a result of the formation of various university courses on the subject. This helped to professionalise the discipline, and meant that it was no longer an amateur- dominated field of research. It was in the latter decade of this period that a belief in ley lines was taken up by members of the counterculture, where‚Äîin the words of the archaeologist Matthew Johnson‚Äîthey were attributed with \\"sacred significance or mystical power\\". Ruggles noted that in this period, ley lines came to be conceived as \\"lines of power, the paths of some form of spiritual force or energy accessible to our ancient ancestors but now lost to narrow-minded twentieth-century scientific thought\\". In his 1961 book Skyways and Landmarks, Tony Wedd published his idea that Watkins' leys were both real and served as ancient markers to guide alien spacecraft that were visiting Earth. He came to this conclusion after comparing Watkins' ideas with those of the French ufologist Aim√© Michel, who argued for the existence of \\"orthotenies\\", lines along which alien spacecraft travelled. Wedd suggested that either spacecraft were following the prehistoric landmarks for guidance or that both the leys and the spacecraft were following a \\"magnetic current\\" flowing across the Earth. Wedd's ideas were taken up by the writer John Michell, who promoted them to a wider audience in his 1967 book The Flying Saucer Vision. In this book, Michell promoted the ancient astronaut belief that extraterrestrials had assisted humanity during prehistory, when humans had worshipped these entities as gods, but that the aliens left when humanity became too materialistic and technology-focused. He also argued that humanity's materialism was driving it to self-destruction, but that this could be prevented by re-activating the ancient centres which would facilitate renewed contact with the aliens. Michell repeated his beliefs in his 1969 book The View Over Atlantis. Hutton described it as \\"almost the founding document of the modern earth mysteries movement\\". Here he interpreted ley lines by reference to the Chinese concept of lung mei energy lines. He proposed that an advanced ancient society that had once covered much of the world had established ley lines across the landscape to harness this lung mei energy. Translating these lung mei as \\"dragon paths\\", he reinterpreted tales from English mythology and folklore in which heroes killed dragons so that the dragon-slayers became the villains. The historian Ronald Hutton later noted that Michell's ideas \\"embodied a fervent religious feeling, which though not Christian was heavily influenced by Christian models\\", adopting an \\"evangelical and apocalyptic tone\\" that announced the coming of an Age of Aquarius in which ancient wisdom would be restored. Michell invented various claims about archaeological evidence to suit his purpose. He viewed archaeologists as antagonists, seeing them as the personification of the modern materialism he was railing against. In the mid-1970s, Michell then published a detailed case study of the West Penwith district of Cornwall, laying out what he believed to be the ley lines in that area. He presented this as a challenge to archaeologists, urging them to examine his ideas in detail and stating that he would donate a large sum of money to charity if they could disprove them. Hutton noted that it represented \\"the finest piece of surveying work\\" then undertaken by a pseudo-archaeologists in Britain; however, Michell had included natural rock outcrops as well as medieval crosses in his list of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments. The ley hunting community In 1962, a group of ufologists established the Ley Hunter's Club. Michell's publication was followed by an upsurge in ley hunting as enthusiasts travelled around the British landscape seeking to identify what they believed to be ley lines connecting various historic structures. Parish churches were particularly favoured by the ley hunters, who often worked on the assumption that such churches had almost always been built atop pre- Christian sacred sites. The 1970s and 1980s also saw the increase in publications appearing on the topic of ley lines. One ley lines enthusiast, Philip Heselton, established the Ley Hunter magazine, which launched in 1965. It later came to be edited by Paul Screeton, who also wrote the book Quicksilver Heritage, in which he argued that the Neolithic period had seen an idyllic society devoted to spirituality but that this was brought to an end through the introduction of metal technologies in the Bronze Age. He argued that this golden age could nevertheless be restored. Another key book produced among the ley hunting community was Mysterious Britain, written by Janet and Colin Bord. In the 1960s, Philip Heselton (pictured in 2005) established the Ley Hunter magazine Part of the popularity of ley hunting was that individuals without any form of professional training in archaeology could take part and feel that they could rediscover \\"the magical landscapes of the past\\". Ley hunting welcomed those who had \\"a strong interest in the past but feel excluded from the narrow confines of orthodox academia\\". The ley hunting movement often blended their activities with other esoteric practices, such as numerology and dowsing. The movement had a diverse base, consisting of individuals from different class bases and of different political opinions: it contained adherents of both radical left and radical right ideologies. Ley hunters often differed on how they understood the ley lines; some believed the leys only marked the pre-existing energy current, whereas others thought that the leys helped to control and direct it. They were nevertheless generally in agreement that the ley lines were laid out between 5000 BCE and 2600 BCE, after the introduction of agriculture but before the introduction of metal in Britain. For many ley hunters, this Neolithic period was seen as a golden age in which Britons lived in harmony with the natural environment. Attitudes to the archaeological establishment also varied among ley hunters, with some of the latter wanting to convert archaeologists to their beliefs and others believing that that was an impossible task. Ley hunters nevertheless often took an interest in the work of archaeo-astronomers like Alexander Thom and Euan Mackie, whose arguments about the existence of sophisticated astronomer- priests in British prehistory appealed to the ley hunters. In suggesting that prehistoric Britons were far more advanced in mathematics and astronomy than archaeologists had previously accepted, Thom's work was seen as giving additional credibility to the beliefs of ley hunters. Thom lent the idea of leys some support; in 1971 he stated the view that Neolithic British engineers would have been capable of surveying a straight line between two points that were otherwise not visible from each other. Paul Devereux succeeded Screeton as the editor of the Ley Hunter. He was more concerned than many other ley hunters with finding objective evidence for the idea that unusual forms of energy could be measured at places where prehistoric communities had erected structures. He was one of the founding members of the Dragon Project, launched in London in 1977 with the purpose of conducting radioactivity and ultrasonic tests at prehistoric sites, particularly the stone circles created in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. The Dragon Project continued its research throughout the 1980s, finding that certain prehistoric sites did show higher or lower than average rates of radiation but that others did not and that there was no consistent pattern. Professional archaeologists, whose view of the ley hunters was largely negative, took little interest in such research. It was only in the 1980s that professional archaeologists in Britain began to engage with the ley hunting movement. In 1983, Ley Lines in Question, a book written by the archaeologists Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy, was published. In this work, Williamson and Bellamy considered and tackled the evidence that ley lines exponents had amassed in support of their beliefs. As part of their book, they tackled the example of the West Penwith district set out as a challenge to archaeologists by Michell the previous decade. They highlighted that the British landscape was so highly covered in historic monuments that it was statistically unlikely that any straight line could be drawn across the landscape without passing through several such sites. They also demonstrated that ley hunters had often claimed that certain markers were Neolithic, and thus roughly contemporary with each other, when often they were of widely different dates, such as being Iron Age or medieval. The overall message of their book was that the idea of leys, as it was being presented by Earth Mysteries proponents, had no basis in empirical reality. Looking back on the book's reception in 2000, Williamson noted that \\"archaeologists weren't particularly interested, and ley-line people were hostile\\". Schism in the community Williamson and Bellamy's book brought two different responses from the ley hunter community. Some maintained that even if the presence of earth energies running through ley lines could not be demonstrated with empirical evidence and rational argumentation, this did not matter; for them, a belief in ley lines was an act of faith, and in their view archaeologists were too narrow-minded to comprehend this reality. The other approach was to further engage archaeologists by seeking out new data and arguments to bolster their beliefs in ley lines. Hutton noted that this pulled along \\"a potential fissure between rationalism and mysticism which had always been inherent in the movement\\". In 1989, a book that Devereux had co-written with Nigel Pennick, Lines on the Landscape, was published. It laid aside ideas of leys representing channels for earth energy, noting that this was beyond the realm of scientific verification, and instead focused on trying to build a case for ley lines that archaeologists could engage with. In particular, it drew attention to ethnographically recorded beliefs in the importance of lines running through the landscape in various communities around the world, proposing these as ethnographic comparisons for what might have occurred in prehistoric Britain. Hutton called the book \\"an important development\\", for it was \\"by far the most well-researched, intelligently written and beautifully produced work yet published on leys\\". Devereux pursued this approach in a series of further books. Reflecting his move towards archaeology, in 1991, Devereux published an article on sightlines from the prehistoric site of Silbury Hill, Wiltshire in Antiquity, a respected journal of British archaeology. By the 1990s, British archaeology had become more open to ideas about language and cognition, topics that Earth Mysteries enthusiasts had long been interested in. A prominent example of this was the work of Christopher Tilley, who devised the idea of phenomenology, or using human senses to experience a landscape as a means of trying to ascertain how past societies would have done the same. The Ley Hunter magazine ceased publication in 1999. Its last editor, Danny Sullivan, stated that the idea of leys was \\"dead\\". Hutton suggested that some of the enthusiasm formally directed toward leys was instead directed toward archaeo-astronomy. He also noted that the ley hunting community had \\"functioned as an indispensable training ground for a small but important group of non-academic scholars who have made a genuine contribution to the study of folklore and mythology.\\" Pennick for instance went on to write a range of short books and pamphlets on European folklore. Another prominent ley hunter, Bob Trubshaw, also wrote several books on these subjects and served as a publisher for others. Jeremy Harte, editor of Wessex Earth Mysteries, subsequently produced several books on folklore; his book on British fairy lore later won the Folklore Society's annual prize. Continuing belief Modern Pagans in Britain often believe in ley lines running through ancient sites, such as the Coldrum Long Barrow in Kent (pictured) In 2005, Ruggles noted that \\"for the most part, ley lines represent an unhappy episode now consigned to history\\". However, belief in ley lines persists among various esoteric groups, having become an \\"enduring feature of some brands of esotericism\\". As Hutton observed, a belief in \\"ancient earth energies have passed so far into the religious experience of the 'New Age' counter-culture of Europe and America that it is unlikely that any tests of evidence would bring about an end to belief in them.\\" During the 1970s and 1980s, a belief in ley lines fed into the modern Pagan community. Research that took place in 2014 found that various Druids and other Pagans believed that there were ley lines focusing on the Early Neolithic site of Coldrum Long Barrow in Kent, southeast England. In the U.S. city of Seattle, a dowsing organisation called the Geo Group plotted what they believed were the ley lines across the city. They stated that their \\"project made Seattle the first city on Earth to balance and tune its ley-line system\\". The Seattle Arts Commission contributed $5,000 to the project, bringing criticisms from members of the public who regarded it as a waste of money. Criticism 8-point ley line alignments of pizza restaurants in London Ley lines have been characterised as a form of pseudoscience. On The Skeptic's Dictionary, the American philosopher and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll noted that none of the claims about magnetic forces underpinning putative ley lines have been scientifically verified. Williamson and Bellamy characterised ley lines as \\"one of the biggest red herrings in the history of popular thought\\". One criticism of Watkins' ley line theory states that given the high density of historic and prehistoric sites in Britain and other parts of Europe, finding straight lines that \\"connect\\" sites is trivial and ascribable to coincidence. Johnson stated that \\"ley lines do not exist.\\" He cited Williamson and Bellamy's work in demonstrating this, noting that their research showed how \\"the density of archaeological sites in the British landscape is so great that a line drawn through virtually anywhere will 'clip' a number of sites.\\" A study by David George Kendall used the techniques of shape analysis to examine the triangles formed by standing stones to deduce if these were often arranged in straight lines. The shape of a triangle can be represented as a point on the sphere, and the distribution of all shapes can be thought of as a distribution over the sphere. The sample distribution from the standing stones was compared with the theoretical distribution to show that the occurrence of straight lines was no more than average. The archaeologist Richard Atkinson once demonstrated this by taking the positions of telephone boxes and pointing out the existence of \\"telephone box leys\\". This, he argued, showed that the mere existence of such lines in a set of points does not prove that the lines are deliberate artefacts, especially since it is known that telephone boxes were not laid out in any such manner or with any such intention. In 2004, John Bruno Hare wrote: > Watkins never attributed any supernatural significance to leys; he believed > that they were simply pathways that had been used for trade or ceremonial > purposes, very ancient in origin, possibly dating back to the Neolithic, > certainly pre-Roman.

The river is marked by Rhine-kilometres 170 to 529 (the scale beginning in Konstanz and ending in Rotterdam). The Upper Rhine is one of four sections of the river (the others being the High Rhine, Middle Rhine and Lower Rhine) between Lake Constance and the North Sea. The countries and states along the Upper Rhine are Switzerland, France (Alsace) and the German states of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse. The largest cities along the river are Basel, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen and Mainz. The Upper Rhine was straightened between 1817 and 1876 by Johann Gottfried Tulla and made navigable between 1928 and 1977. The Treaty of Versailles allows France to use the Upper Rhine for hydroelectricity in the Grand Canal d'Alsace. On the left bank are the French region of Alsace and the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate; on the right bank are the German states of Baden- W√ºrttemberg and Hesse. The first few kilometres are in the Swiss city of Basel.  Geology  Around 35 million years ago, a rift valley of about long and wide came into being between the present cities of Basel and Frankfurt. This was due to tensile stresses in the Earth's crust and mantle, which resulted in lowering the earth's surface. The moat has been partially filled up again by sedimentation. On the edges we find mountain ridges, the so-called \\"rift flanks\\". On the eastern side, they are the Black Forest and Odenwald mountains, in the west the Vosges and Palatinate Forest. During the Tertiary, the High Rhine continued west from Basel and flowed via the Doubs and the Sa√¥ne, into the Rh√¥ne. The rift diverted the Rhine into the newly formed Upper Rhine Valley. The Rhine knee at Basel marks the transition from the High Rhine to the Upper Rhine with a change of direction from West to North and a change of landscape from the relatively small-chamber high-Rhine cuesta landscape to the wide rift zone of the Upper Rhine Rift Valley. The two largest tributaries come from the right: the Neckar in Mannheim, the Main across from Mainz. In the northwest corner of the Upper Rhine Valley, at Rhine-kilometre 529.1, near Bingen, where the Nahe flows into the Rhine, the Rhine flows into a gorge in the Rhenish Massif and thereby changes into the Middle Rhine.  Straightening  In 1685, Louis XIV started a project to move the Upper Rhine, change its course and drain the floodplain, in order to gain land. By 1840, the river had been moved up to to the east, taking territory away from Baden. Around 1790, large parts of the Rhine Valley were deforested, creating arable land, fields and pasture to feed the population. The Upper Rhine was straightened between 1817 and 1876 by Johann Gottfried Tulla and changed from a relatively sluggish meandering river with major and many smaller branches into a fast flowing stream flanked by embankments. The length of the Upper Rhine was reduced by . Some cut-off river arms and ox-bows remain; they are typically called the Old Rhine () or .  Canalising and dams  The Rhine between Basel and Iffezheim is almost entirely canalised. On a stretch of , there are 10 dams, provided with hydropower stations and locks. Between Basel and Breisach, the old river bed carries hardly any water; almost all water is diverted through the Grand Canal d'Alsace on the French side, to ensure safe shipping and hydropower generation around the clock. Only when there is a large supply of water, then the old river bed will receive more water than the canal. France gained the right to do this in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles; the right applies to the segment between Basel and Neuburgweier/Lauterbourg, where the Rhine forms the border between France and Germany. The straightening (1817‚Äì76) and channeling (1928‚Äì77) reduced the water table by up to and thus had a negative effect on flora and fauna. Gravel is also missing from the river, due to the dams. This has caused erosion below the dam at Iffezheim. To counter this, per year of a mixture of sand and gravel with an average grain diameter of (corresponding to the local sediment transport capacity) has been dumped into the river, since 1978, using two motorized barges. Weir at Breisach; to the left a lock; to the right a small power station under construction  Conservation  The floodplains between Mainz and Bingen are important for nature conservation. In this section, the so-called Island Rhine, there are many nature reserves and bird sanctuaries.  Integrated Rhine Programme (IRP)  The Upper Rhine plays a key role in flood control on the Middle and Lower Rhine. As a result of the straightening of the Upper Rhine, floods from the Alps now reach the Middle Rhine much faster than in the past. Thus, the risk of such a peak coinciding with a flood peak of Neckar, Moselle or Main has increased. About of floodplain have been lost. Authorities in riparian states of France, Baden- W√ºrttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate have launched the Integrated Rhine Programme, a framework for designating water retention areas. to combat downstream flooding. A French-German treaty was concluded in 1982, in which the parties agreed to restore the retention capacity on the stretch below Iffezheim to the level it had before the area was developed. This means: For the stretch between Iffezheim and the mouth of the Neckar, attenuation of the apex of a 200-year flood (i.e. a flood that statistically occurs once in 200 years) of the Rhine to a discharge of at the Maxau gauge station, that is, a reduction from to . * for the stretch below the mouth of the Neckar, attenuation of the apex of a 220-year flood to a discharge of at the Worms gauge station, that is, a reduction from to . For this purpose the following measures are planned and partially implemented: * By France: Special operations power stations on the Rhine and construction of two polders Erstein and Moder * By Baden-W√ºrttemberg: construction of about 13 polders * By Rhineland-Palatinate: construction of polders and relocating levees The effectiveness of the flood protection measures was verified using a computer model. The State Institute for the Environment, Nature Protection and Measurements in Baden-W√ºrttemberg carried out forecast calculations with the help of a mathematical \\"synoptic flood progression model\\". The analysis of the calculations and the evaluation of the results were made on the basis of the requirements and methods set by the international Flood Study Commission for the Rhine. The implementation of the proposed flood control measures on the Upper Rhine can prevent the occurrence of a 200-year-flood between Iffezheim and Bingen, with an overall economic loss estimated at around 6.2 billion euros.  Tri-national metropolitan region  The Upper Rhine tri-national region (French: R√©gion M√©tropolitaine Trinationale du Rhin Sup√©rieur, German: Trinationale Metropolregion Oberrhein) is a Euroregion that covers the border areas of the Upper Rhine (the northern part of the Upper Rhine valley and the Palatinate are not included as they are not border areas) and parts of the High Rhine. As the name suggests, it is a tri-national region comprising parts of France, Germany and Switzerland.

In the 1960s, synthesizers‚Äîin the form of large, expensive, and complex modular synthesizers‚Äîwere inaccessible to most musicians. The Minimoog was designed as an affordable, portable, simplified instrument which combined the most useful components of the Moog synthesizer in single device. It was the first synthesizer sold in retail stores. It was first popular with progressive rock and jazz musicians and found wide use in disco, pop, rock and electronic music. After the sale of Moog Music, production of the Minimoog stopped in the early 1980s. In 2002, after founder Robert Moog regained the rights to the Moog brand and bought the company, the Minimoog Voyager, an updated version, was released. In 2016, Moog Music released a new version of the original Minimoog.  Development  An early 1970s Minimoog Model D synthesizer In the 1960s, RA Moog Co manufactured Moog synthesizers, which helped bring electronic sounds to music but remained inaccessible to ordinary people. These modular synthesizers were difficult to use and required users to connect components manually with patch cables to create sounds. They were also sensitive to temperature and humidity, and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Most were owned by universities or record labels, and used to create soundtracks or jingles; by 1970, only 28 were owned by musicians. Hoping to create a smaller, more reliable synthesizer, Moog engineer Bill Hemsath created a prototype by sawing a keyboard in half and wiring several components into a small cabinet. Moog president Robert Moog felt the prototype was fun, but did not initially see a market for it. Moog and the engineers created several more prototypes, adding features such as the suitcase design to aid portability. In early 1970, Moog Co began losing money as interest in its modular synthesizers fell. Fearing they would lose their jobs if the company closed, the engineers developed a version of Hemsath's miniature synthesizer, the Minimoog Model D, while Moog was away. Moog chastised them, but came to see the potential in the Model D and authorized its production. As the engineers could not properly stabilize the power supply, the Minimoog's three oscillators were never completely synchronized. Although unintentional, this created the synthesizer's \\"warm, rich\\" sound. Its voltage-controlled filter was unique, allowing users to shape sounds to create \\"everything from blistering, funky bass blurps ... to spacey whistle lead tones\\". The Minimoog also was the first synthesizer to feature a pitch wheel, which allows players to bend notes as a guitarist or saxophonist does, allowing for more expressive playing. Moog's associate David Borden felt that Moog would have become extremely wealthy had he patented the pitch wheel.  Release  Moog Co released the first Minimoog in 1971. Moog said it was \\"conceived originally as a session musician's axe, something a guy could carry to the studio, do a gig and walk out. We thought we'd sell maybe 100 of them.\\" Moog hired engineer and musicologist David Van Koevering to demonstrate Minimoogs to musicians and music stores. Van Koevering's friend Glen Bell, founder of the restaurant chain Taco Bell, allowed him to use a building on a private island Bell owned in Florida. There, Van Koevering hosted an event he billed as Island of Electronicus, a \\"pseudo-psychedelic experience that brought counterculture (minus the drugs) to straight families and connected it with the sound of the Minimoog\\". The Minimoog was in continuous production for 13 years and over 12,000 were made. It was the first synthesiser sold in retail stores. Despite the success, Moog Co could not afford to meet demand, nor had credit for a loan, and Moog sold the company. Production of the Minimoog stopped in 1981 and Moog Co ceased all production in 1993. = Later models = Minimoog from 1979 (left) and 2017 In 2002, Robert Moog reacquired the rights to the Moog name and bought the company. In 2002, Moog Co released the Minimoog Voyager, an updated version of the Minimoog that sold more than 14,000 units, more than the original Minimoog. In 2016, Moog Music began manufacturing an updated version of the Model D. Production ended in June 2017. In 2018, Moog Music released the Minimoog Model D app for iOS.  Impact  According to TJ Pinch, author of Analog Days, the Minimoog was the first synthesizer to become a \\"classic\\". Wired described it as \\"the most famous synthesizer in music history ... a ubiquitous analog keyboard that can be heard in countless pop, rock, hip-hop, and techno tracks from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s\\". It was also important for its portability. David Borden, an associate of Moog, said that the Minimoog \\"took the synthesizer out of the studio and put it into the concert hall\\".Franklin Crawford (August 23, 2005). \\"Robert Moog, Ph.D. '64, inventor of the music synthesizer, dies of brain cancer\\". Cornell University News Service. Retrieved 4 May 2007. According to the Guardian, \\"Tweaked now so that the synthesiser could reliably perform as either a melodic lead or propulsive bass instrument (rather than just as a complex sound-generating machine), the Minimoog changed everything ... the Moogs oozed character. Their sound could be quirky, kitsch and cute, or pulverising, but it was always identifiable as Moog.\\" The Minimoog changed the dynamics of rock bands. For the first time, keyboardists could play solos in the style of lead guitarists, or play synthesized basslines. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman said: \\"For the first time you could go on [stage] and give the guitarist a run for his money...a guitarist would say, 'Oh shoot, he's got a Minimoog', so they're looking for eleven on their volume control - it's the only way they can compete.\\" Wakeman said the instrument \\"absolutely changed the face of music\\".Hans Fjellestad (2004). Moog The Minimoog took a place in mainstream black music, most notably in the work of Stevie Wonder. Its use for basslines became particularly popular in funk, as in the Parliament track \\"Flash Light\\". It was also popular in jazz, and Sun Ra became perhaps the first musician to perform and record with the instrument (on his 1970 album My Brother the Wind). Herbie Hancock, Dick Hyman and Chick Corea were other early adopters. The Minimoog became a staple of progressive rock. In the early 1970s, Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer made the Minimoog a central part of his performances. Wakeman used five Minimoogs on stage so he could play different sounds without having to reconfigure them. It was also used by electronic artists such as Kraftwerk, who used it on their albums Autobahn (1974) and The Man-Machine (1978), and later by Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Gary Numan. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, it was widely used in the emerging disco genre by artists including Abba and Giorgio Moroder. In 2012, to celebrate Moog's birthday, Google created an interactive version of the Minimoog as its Google Doodle.

The same material can be used as a casting resin or in inks and coatings, among many other uses. Although not a type of familiar silica-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified as a type of glass (in that it is a non- crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historic designation as acrylic glass. Chemically, it is the synthetic polymer of methyl methacrylate. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, Otto R√∂hm, and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by German R√∂hm & Haas AG (as of January 2019 part of Evonik Industries) and its partner and former U.S. affiliate Rohm and Haas Company under the trademark Plexiglas acrylic.Plexiglas history by Evonik (German only) PMMA is an economical alternative to polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than impact strength, chemical resistance, and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate and is a far better choice for laser cutting. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance. History The first acrylic acid was created in 1843. Methacrylic acid, derived from acrylic acid, was formulated in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in the United Kingdom. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto R√∂hm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which R√∂hm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas acrylic in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas acrylic were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 ICI Acrylics (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass. Civilian applications followed after the war. =Names= Common orthographic stylings include polymethyl methacrylate and polymethylmethacrylate. The full IUPAC chemical name is poly(methyl 2-methylpropenoate). (It is a common mistake to use \\"an\\" instead of \\"en\\".) Although PMMA is often called simply \\"acrylic\\", acrylic can also refer to other polymers or copolymers containing polyacrylonitrile. Notable trade names include Acrylite, Lucite, PerClax, R-Cast, Plexiglas acrylic, Optix, Perspex, Oroglas, Altuglas, Cyrolite, Astariglas,http://astariglobal.com Cho Chen, and Sumipex. Synthesis PMMA is routinely produced by emulsion polymerization, solution polymerization, and bulk polymerization. Generally, radical initiation is used (including living polymerization methods), but anionic polymerization of PMMA can also be performed. To produce of PMMA, about of petroleum is needed. PMMA produced by radical polymerization (all commercial PMMA) is atactic and completely amorphous. Processing The glass transition temperature (Tg) of atactic PMMA is . The Tg values of commercial grades of PMMA range from ; the range is so wide because of the vast number of commercial compositions which are copolymers with co-monomers other than methyl methacrylate. PMMA is thus an organic glass at room temperature; i.e., it is below its Tg. The forming temperature starts at the glass transition temperature and goes up from there. All common molding processes may be used, including injection molding, compression molding, and extrusion. The highest quality PMMA sheets are produced by cell casting, but in this case, the polymerization and molding steps occur concurrently. The strength of the material is higher than molding grades owing to its extremely high molecular mass. Rubber toughening has been used to increase the toughness of PMMA to overcome its brittle behavior in response to applied loads. Handling, cutting, and joining PMMA can be joined using cyanoacrylate cement (commonly known as superglue), with heat (welding), or by using chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane or trichloromethane\\"Working with Plexiglas\\" . science-projects.com. (chloroform) to dissolve the plastic at the joint, which then fuses and sets, forming an almost invisible weld. Scratches may easily be removed by polishing or by heating the surface of the material. Laser cutting may be used to form intricate designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a very clean cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the cut edge, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable \\"stress-crazing\\" at the cut edge and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap- and-water produces similar undesirable crazing, sometimes over the entire surface of the cut parts, at great distances from the stressed edge. Annealing the PMMA sheet/parts is therefore an obligatory post-processing step when intending to chemically bond lasercut parts together. In the majority of applications, it will not shatter. Rather, it breaks into large dull pieces. Since PMMA is softer and more easily scratched than glass, scratch-resistant coatings are often added to PMMA sheets to protect it (as well as possible other functions).

It also has good impact strength, higher than both glass and polystyrene; however, PMMA's impact strength is still significantly lower than polycarbonate and some engineered polymers. PMMA ignites at and burns, forming carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide and low-molecular-weight compounds, including formaldehyde. PMMA transmits up to 92% of visible light (3 mm thickness), and gives a reflection of about 4% from each of its surfaces due to its refractive index (1.4905 at 589.3 nm).Refractive index and related constants ‚Äì Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Acrylic glass) .

PMMA passes infrared light of up to 2,800 nm and blocks IR of longer wavelengths up to 25,000 nm. Colored PMMA varieties allow specific IR wavelengths to pass while blocking visible light (for remote control or heat sensor applications, for example). PMMA swells and dissolves in many organic solvents; it also has poor resistance to many other chemicals due to its easily hydrolyzed ester groups. Nevertheless, its environmental stability is superior to most other plastics such as polystyrene and polyethylene, and PMMA is therefore often the material of choice for outdoor applications.Myer Ezrin Plastics Failure Guide: Cause and Prevention , Hanser Verlag, 1996 , p. 168 PMMA has a maximum water absorption ratio of 0.3‚Äì0.4% by weight.DATA TABLE FOR: Polymers: Commodity Polymers: PMMA .

Rather, modified formulations with varying amounts of other comonomers, additives, and fillers are created for uses where specific properties are required. For example, * A small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in PMMA grades destined for heat processing, since this stabilizes the polymer to depolymerization (\\"unzipping\\") during processing. * Comonomers such as butyl acrylate are often added to improve impact strength. * Comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications. * Plasticizers may be added to improve processing properties, lower the glass transition temperature, or improve impact properties. * Dyes may be added to give color for decorative applications, or to protect against (or filter) UV light. * Fillers may be added to improve cost-effectiveness. Poly(methyl acrylate) The polymer of methyl acrylate, PMA or poly(methyl acrylate), is similar to poly(methyl methacrylate), except for the lack of methyl groups on the backbone carbon chain.Polymethyl acrylate and polyethyl acrylate, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica . Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 2012-05-09. PMA is a soft white rubbery material that is softer than PMMA because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other. Uses Being transparent and durable, PMMA is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles, appliances, and lenses for glasses. PMMA in the form of sheets affords to shatter resistant panels for building windows, skylights, bulletproof security barriers, signs & displays, sanitary ware (bathtubs), LCD screens, furniture and many other applications. It is also used for coating polymers based on MMA provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of VOC.

This compatibility was discovered by the English ophthalmologist Sir Harold Ridley in WWII RAF pilots, whose eyes had been riddled with PMMA splinters coming from the side windows of their Supermarine Spitfire fighters ‚Äì the plastic scarcely caused any rejection, compared to glass splinters coming from aircraft such as the Hawker Hurricane.Robert A. Meyers, \\"Molecular biology and biotechnology: a comprehensive desk reference\\", Wiley-VCH, 1995, p. 722 Ridley had a lens manufactured by the Rayner company (Brighton & Hove, East Sussex) made from Perspex polymerised by ICI. On 29 November 1949 at St Thomas' Hospital, London, Ridley implanted the first intraocular lens at St Thomas's Hospital in London. In particular, acrylic-type contact lenses are useful for cataract surgery in patients that have recurrent ocular inflammation (uveitis), as acrylic material induces less inflammation. * Eyeglass lenses are commonly made from PMMA. * Historically, hard contact lenses were frequently made of this material. Soft contact lenses are often made of a related polymer, where acrylate monomers containing one or more hydroxyl groups make them hydrophilic. *In orthopedic surgery, PMMA bone cement is used to affix implants and to remodel lost bone. It is supplied as a powder with liquid methyl methacrylate (MMA). Although PMMA is biologically compatible, MMA is considered to be an irritant and a possible carcinogen. PMMA has also been linked to cardiopulmonary events in the operating room due to hypotension. Bone cement acts like a grout and not so much like a glue in arthroplasty. Although sticky, it does not bond to either the bone or the implant; rather, it primarily fills the spaces between the prosthesis and the bone preventing motion. A disadvantage of this bone cement is that it heats up to while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue. A careful balance of initiators and monomers is needed to reduce the rate of polymerization, and thus the heat generated. *In cosmetic surgery, tiny PMMA microspheres suspended in some biological fluid are injected as a soft tissue filler under the skin to reduce wrinkles or scars permanently. PMMA as a soft tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with HIV-related facial wasting. PMMA is used illegally to shape muscles by some bodybuilders. *Plombage is an outdated treatment of tuberculosis where the pleural space around an infected lung was filled with PMMA balls, in order to compress and collapse the affected lung. *Emerging biotechnology and Biomedical research uses PMMA to create microfluidic lab-on- a-chip devices, which require 100 micrometre-wide geometries for routing liquids. These small geometries are amenable to using PMMA in a biochip fabrication process and offers moderate biocompatibility. *Bioprocess chromatography columns use cast acrylic tubes as an alternative to glass and stainless steel. These are pressure rated and satisfy stringent requirements of materials for biocompatibility, toxicity and extractables. = Uses in dentistry = Due to its aforementioned biocompatibility, Poly(methyl methacrylate) is a commonly used material in modern dentistry, particularly in the fabrication of dental prosthetics, artificial teeth, and orthodontic appliances. ; Acrylic prosthetic construction: Pre-polymerized, powdered PMMA spheres are mixed with a Methyl Methacrylate liquid monomer, Benzoyl Peroxide (initiator), and NN-Dimethyl-P-Toluidine (accelerator), and placed under heat and pressure to produce a hardened polymerized PMMA structure. Through the use of injection molding techniques, wax based designs with artificial teeth set in predetermined positions built on gypsum stone models of patients' mouths can be converted into functional prosthetics used to replace missing dentition. PMMA polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis, and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process. Pressure is used during the curing process to minimize polymerization shrinkage, ensuring an accurate fit of the prosthesis. Though other methods of polymerizing PMMA for prosthetic fabrication exist, such as chemical and microwave resin activation, the previously described heat-activated resin polymerization technique is the most commonly used due to its cost effectiveness and minimal polymerization shrinkage. ; Artificial teeth: While denture teeth can be made of several different materials, PMMA is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics. Mechanical properties of the material allow for heightened control of aesthetics, easy surface adjustments, decreased risk of fracture when in function in the oral cavity, and minimal wear against opposing teeth. Additionally, since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using PMMA, adherence of PMMA denture teeth to PMMA denture bases is unparalleled, leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic. =Artistic and aesthetic uses= Lexus Perspex car sculpture. PMMA art by Manfred Kielnhofer Kawai acrylic grand piano * Acrylic paint essentially consists of PMMA suspended in water; however since PMMA is hydrophobic, a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the suspension. * Modern furniture makers, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, seeking to give their products a space age aesthetic, incorporated Lucite and other PMMA products into their designs, especially office chairs.

A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this can be made by an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made.

Extropians believe that advances in science and technology will some day let people live indefinitely. An extropian may wish to contribute to this goal, e.g. by doing research and development or by volunteering to test new technology. Originated by a set of principles developed by the philosopher Max More, The Principles of Extropy, extropian thinking places strong emphasis on rational thinking and on practical optimism. According to More, these principles \\"do not specify particular beliefs, technologies, or policies\\". Extropians share an optimistic view of the future, expecting considerable advances in computational power, life extension, nanotechnology and the like. Many extropians foresee the eventual realization of indefinite lifespans, and the recovery, thanks to future advances in biomedical technology or mind uploading, of those whose bodies/brains have been preserved by means of cryonics. Extropy The term 'extropy', as an antonym to 'entropy' was used in a 1967 academic volume discussing cryogenicsCryogenics, IPC Science and Technology Press, vol. 7, pg. 225 (1967) and in a 1978 academic volume of cybernetics.Proceedings of the Fourth International Congress of Cybernetics & Systems: \\"Current Topics in Cybernetics and Systems\\", pg. 258 (1978) Diane Duane was the first to use the term \\"extropy\\" to signify a potential transhuman destiny for humanity.Duane, Diane. \\"The Wounded Sky\\" (1983) Also published in 1983 was J. Neil Schulman's Prometheus Award winning novel, The Rainbow Cadenza which used the term \\"extropic\\" as a type of scale in visual music. 'Extropy' as coined by Tom Bell (T.O. Morrow) and defined by Max More in 1988, is \\"the extent of a living or organizational system's intelligence, functional order, vitality, energy, life, experience, and capacity and drive for improvement and growth.\\" Extropy is not a rigorously defined technical term in philosophy or science; in a metaphorical sense, it simply expresses the opposite of entropy. The Extropy Institute In 1986 More joined Alcor, a Cryonics company, and helped establish (along with Michael Price, Garret Smyth and Luigi Warren) the first European cryonics organization, Mizar Limited (later Alcor UK). In 1987, More moved to Los Angeles from Oxford University in England to work on his Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Southern California. In 1988, Extropy: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought was first published. (For the first few issues, it was \\"Extropy: Vaccine for Future Shock\\".) This brought together thinkers with interests in artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, life extension, mind uploading, idea futures, robotics, space exploration, memetics, and the politics and economics of transhumanism. Alternative media organizations soon began reviewing the magazine, and it attracted interest from like-minded thinkers. Later, More and Bell co-founded the Extropy Institute, a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational organization. \\"ExI\\" was formed as a transhumanist networking and information center to use current scientific understanding along with critical and creative thinking to define a small set of principles or values that could help make sense of new capabilities opening up to humanity. The Extropy Institute's email list was launched in 1991 (and, as of April 2015, continues to exist as \\"Extropy-Chat\\"), and in 1992 the institute began producing the first conferences on transhumanism. Affiliate members throughout the world began organizing their own transhumanist groups. Extro Conferences, meetings, parties, on-line debates, and documentaries continue to spread transhumanism to the public. In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute made a decision to close the organisation, stating that its mission was \\"essentially completed.\\" Extropism Extropism is a modern derivation of the transhumanist philosophy of Extropianism. It follows the same tradition - hence the similarity in naming - but has been revised to better suit the perceived paradigms of the 21st century. As introduced in The Extropist Manifesto,The Extropist Manifesto. The Extropist Examiner (blog). it promotes an optimistic futuristic philosophy that can be summed up in the following five phrases, which spell out the word \\"EXTROPISM\\": *Endless eXtension *Transcending Restriction *Overcoming Property *Intelligence *Smart Machines Extropists desire to prolong their life span to a near-immortal state and exist in a world where artificial intelligence and robotics have made work irrelevant. As in utilitarianism, the purpose of one's life should be to increase the overall happiness of all creatures on Earth through cooperation. The Extropist Manifesto was written by web entrepreneur Breki Tomasson and writer Hank Pellissier - both of whom have had a long transhuman interest - in January, 2010. It details the ways in which Extropism has evolved away from Extropianism, while continuing to building upon its original tenets. For example, it moves away from the original Extropian Principles by placing a significant focus on the need to abolish and/or restrict the current use of surveillance, copyright and patent laws.

Whilst not strictly a castle, it is built in the style of a fortified mansion. It pre- dates the Scottish Baronial style of architecture, and may have been one of the influences on this style. The estate contains the famous Traquair Brewery. History Traquair House in 1814 The house is built on the site of a hunting seat used by the Scottish kings from the 12th century, though no part of the present building can be dated with certainty before the 15th century. Alexander I was the first Scottish king to stay and hunt at Traquair. At that time it was a remote \\"castle\\", surrounded by forest. Upon Alexander III's death in 1286, the peace of the Borders region was shattered and Traquair became a key link in the chain of defence that guarded the Tweed Valley against English invasion. Over the next two centuries Traquair's ownership changed often, at times coming under the control of the English, and at others, the Scottish throne. In the 1460s James III conferred the estate on Dr. William Rogers, an eminent musician, and one of his favourites. After holding the lands for upwards of nine years, Dr. Rogers sold them for an insignificant sum in 1478 to the Earl of Buchan. The Earl gifted the estate to his illegitimate son, James Stuart (1480-1513), 1st Laird of Traquair, in 1491. James Stuart obtained letters of legitimation and married the heiress of the Rutherfords, with whom he received the estates of Rutherford and Wells in Roxburghshire. He was killed at the Battle of Flodden. His daughter, Jane Stewart, had a daughter Janet with the Earl of Angus born out of wedlock, who married Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven. Traquair remained the family seat of the Earls of Traquair for the next four centuries. In 1875 Traquair passed to a cousin of the Stuarts, Henry Constable Maxwell. He was a direct descendant, but via the female line. The National Portrait Gallery holds a 1992 portrait of Catherine Maxwell Stuart, 21st Lady of Traquair. Features Traquair is a 50-room house. The rooms include \\"The Drawing Room\\", containing ancestral portraits and photographs of the current residents; \\"The Dressing Room\\", which is decorated to demonstrate life in former times; \\"The Museum Room\\", containing a mural dating from 1530, one of the oldest to survive in a secular building in Scotland, as well as charters stamped with the royal seals and signatures of the Scottish Kings; \\"The King's Room\\", where Mary, Queen of Scots stayed in 1566 and which contains some relics belonging to her and the Jacobites, such as her rosary, crucifix, purse, a silk quilt, and letters bearing her signature; \\"The Still Room\\", where breakfast is taken among the 18th century porcelain that decorates the shelves; and \\"The Dining Room\\", one of the last additions to the house, built in the late 17th century. There is a Roman Catholic chapel built in 1829, following the Catholic emancipation. The 18th century library contains more than 3,000 volumes. Although three lairds made alterations to the house prior to the 17th century, Traquair has changed little, architecturally, since then. The Bear Gates at the main entrance to the grounds were installed by the fifth Earl, Charles Stuart, in 1738. When they were closed, after Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) passed through in 1745, the Earl vowed they would never be opened again until a Stuart king returned.  Tam-Lin (film)  The 1970 film Tam-Lin was filmed at Traquair. It starred Ava Gardner, other cast members included Joanna Lumley, Stephanie Beecham and Ian McShane.https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0067822/locations Brewery The Traquair House Brewery was started in 1965 by Peter Maxwell Stuart using the 18th century domestic brewery equipment that had previously been used to make beer for the house. Ale is fermented in the original oak tuns, some of which are over 200 years old. The brewery makes a range of beers, though the two main brands are Jacobite Ale and House Ale. 224x224px Ale was brewed at Traquair during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1739 a 200-gallon copper was installed in the brew house under the chapel.

The concept of the design is to allow all prisoners of an institution to be observed by a single security guard, without the inmates being able to tell whether they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single guard to observe all the inmates' cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that they are motivated to act as though they are being watched at all times. Thus, the inmates are effectively compelled to regulate their own behaviour. The architecture consists of a rotunda with an inspection house at its centre. From the centre the manager or staff of the institution are able to watch the inmates. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a panopticon prison. It is his prison that is now most widely meant by the term \\"panopticon\\".  Conceptual history  Virtual reality reconstruction of how Bentham‚Äôs panopticon would have appeared if built.

Elevated view of the panopticon prison, by Reveley 1791. The word panopticon derives from the Greek word for \\"all seeing\\" ‚Äì panoptes. In 1785, Jeremy Bentham, an English social reformer and founder of utilitarianism, travelled to Krichev in White Russia (modern Belarus) to visit his brother, Samuel, who accompanied Prince Potemkin. Bentham arrived in Krichev in early 1786 and stayed for almost two years. While residing with his brother in Krichev, Bentham sketched out the concept of the panopticon in letters. Bentham applied his brother's ideas on the constant observation of workers to prisons. Back in England Bentham with the assistance of his brother continued to develop his theory on the panopticon. Prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison, Bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory. While in his lifetime Bentham was a prolific letter writer, he published little and remained obscure to the public until his death. Bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity. Bentham tried to put his duty and interest junction principle into practice by encouraging a public debate on prisons. Bentham's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison, but also the manager. The unaccountable gaoler was to be observed by the general public and public officials. The apparently constant surveillance of the prison inmates by the panopticon manager and the occasional observation of the manager by the general public was to solve the age old philosophic question: \\"Who guards the guards?\\" Bentham continued to develop the panopticon concept, as industrialisation advanced in England and an increasing number of workers were required to work in ever larger factories. Bentham commissioned drawings from an architect, Willey Reveley. Bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched, the prisoners would need to follow the rules. Bentham also thought that Reveley's prison design could be used for factories, asylums, hospitals, and schools. Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the king and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of sinister interest ‚Äì that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest ‚Äì which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.

Presidio Modelo in Cuba, photo taken 2005. Inside one of the buildings of the Presidio Modelo. Bentham's proposal for a panopticon prison met with great interest among British government officials not only because it incorporated the pleasure-pain principle developed by the materialist philosopher Thomas Hobbes, but also because Bentham joined the emerging discussion on political economy. Bentham argued that the confinement of the prison, \\"which is his punishment, preventing [the prisoner from] carrying the work to another market.\\" Key to Bentham's proposals and efforts to build a panopticon prison in Millbank at his own expense, was the \\"means of extracting labour\\" out of prisoners in the panopticon. In his 1791 writing Panopticon, or The Inspection House, Bentham reasoned that those working fixed hours needed to be overseen. Also, in 1791 Jean Philippe Garran de Coulon presented a paper on Bentham's panopticon prison concepts to the National Legislative Assembly in revolutionary France. In 1812 persistent problems with Newgate Prison and other London prisons prompted the British government to fund the construction of a prison in Millbank at the taxpayers' expense. Based on Bentham's panopticon plans, the National Penitentiary opened in 1821. Millbank Prison, as it became known, was controversial and failed in extracting valuable labour out of prisoners. Millbank Prison was even blamed for causing mental illness among prisoners. Nevertheless, the British government placed an increasing emphasis on prisoners doing meaningful work, instead of engaging in humiliating and meaningless kill-times. Bentham lived to see Millbank Prison built and did not support the approach taken by the British government. His writings had virtually no immediate effect on the architecture of taxpayer- funded prisons that were to be built. Between 1818 and 1821 a small prison for women was built in Lancaster. It has been observed that the architect Joseph Gandy modelled it very closely on Bentham's panopticon prison plans. The K-wing near Lancaster Castle prison is a semi-rotunda with a central tower for the supervisor and five storeys with nine cells on each floor. It was the Pentonville prison, which was built in London after Bentham's death in 1832, that was to serve as a model for a further 54 prisons in Victorian Britain. Built between 1840 and 1842 according to the plans of Joshua Jebb, Pentoville prison had a central hall with radial prison wings. It has been claimed that Bentham's panopticon influenced the radial design of 19th-century prisons built on the principles of the \\"separate system\\", including Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, which opened in 1829. But the Pennsylvania‚ÄìPentonville architectural model with its radial prison wings was not designed to facilitate constant surveillance of individual prisoners. Guards had to walk from the hall along the radial corridors and could only observe prisoners in their cells by looking through the cell door's peephole. In 1925 Cuba's president Gerardo Machado set out to build a modern prison, based on Bentham's concepts and employing the latest scientific theories on rehabilitation. A Cuban envoy tasked with studying US prisons in advance of the construction of Presidio Modelo had been greatly impressed with Stateville Correctional Center in Illinois and the cells in the new circular prison were to faced inwards towards a central guard tower. Because of the shuttered guard tower the guards could see the prisoners, but the prisoners could not see the guards. Cuban officials theorised that the prisoners would \\"behave\\" if there was a probable chance that they were under surveillance and once prisoners behaved they could be rehabilitated. Between 1926 and 1931 the Cuban government built four such panopticons connected with tunnels to a massive central structure that served as a community centre. Each panopticon had five floors with 93 cells. In keeping with Bentham's ideas, none of the cells had doors. Prisoners were free to roam the prison and participate in workshops to learn a trade or become literate, the hope being that they would become productive citizens. However, by the time Fidel Castro was imprisoned at Presidio Modelo, the four circulars were packed with 6,000 men, every floor was filled with trash, there was no running water, food rations were meagre, and the government supplied only the bare necessities of life. In the Netherlands Breda, Arnhem and Haarlem penitentiary are cited as historic panopticon prisons. However, these circular prisons with their 400 or so cells fail as panopticons because the inwards facing cell windows were so small that guards could not see the entire cell. The lack of surveillance that was actually possible in prisons with small cells and doors discounts many circular prison designs from being a panopticon as it had been envisaged by Bentham. In 2006 one of the first digital panopticon prisons opened near Amsterdam. Every prisoner in the Lelystad Prison wears an electronic tag and by design, only six guards are needed for 150 prisoners instead of the usual 15 or more.  Architecture of other institutions  Bentham's 1812 industry- house for 2000 persons. Jeremy Bentham's panopticon architecture was not original, as rotundas had been used before, as for example in industrial buildings. However, Bentham turned the rotund architecture into a structure with a societal function, so that humans themselves became the object of control. The idea for a panopticon had been prompted by Samuel Bentham's work in Russia and had been inspired by existing architectural traditions. Samuel Bentham had studied at the Ecole Militaire in 1751 and at about 1773 the prominent French architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux had finished his designs for the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans. William Strutt in cooperation with his friend Jeremy Bentham built a round mill in Belper, so that one supervisor could oversee an entire shop floor from the centre of the round mill. The mill was built between 1803 and 1813 and was used for production until the late 19th century. It was demolished in 1959. In Bentham's 1812 writing Pauper management improved: particularly by means of an application of the Panopticon principle of construction, he included a building for an \\"industry-house establishment\\" that could hold 2000 persons. In 1812 Samuel Bentham, who had by then risen to brigardier-general, tried to persuade the British Admiralty to construct an arsenal panopticon in Kent. Before returning home to London he had constructed a panopticon in 1807, near St Petersburg, which served as a training centre for young men wishing to work in naval manufacturing. The panopticon, Bentham writes: A plate by Pugin. Despite the fact that no panopticon was built during Bentham's lifetime, the principles he established on the panopticon prompted considerable discussion and debate. Shortly after Jeremy Bentham's death in 1832 his ideas were criticised by Augustus Pugin, who in 1841 published the second edition of his work Contrasts in which one plate showed a \\"Modern Poor House\\". He contrasted an English medieval gothic town in 1400 with the same town in 1840 where broken spires and factory chimneys dominate the skyline, with a panopticon in the foreground replacing the Christian hospice. Pugin, who went on to become one of the most influential 19th-century writers on architecture, was influenced by Hegel and German idealism. In 1835 the first annual report of the Poor Law Commission included two designs by the commission's architect Sampson Kempthorne. His Y-shape and cross-shape designs for workhouse expressed the panopticon principle by positioning the master's room as central point. The designs provided for the segregation of occupants and maximum visibility from the centre. Professor David Rothman came to the conclusion that Bentham's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the United States.  Criticism and use as metaphor  In 1965 the conservative historian Shirley Robin Letwin traced the Fabian zest for social planning to early utilitarian thinkers. She argued that Bentham's pet gadget, the panopticon prison, was a device of such monstrous efficiency that it left no room for humanity. She accused Bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that \\"in his ardour for reform, Bentham prepared the way for what he feared\\". Recent Libertarian thinkers began to regard Bentham's entire philosophy as having paved the way for totalitarian states. In the late 1960s, the American historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, who had published The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham in 1965, was at the forefront of depicting Bentham's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control. David John Manning published The Mind of Jeremy Bentham in 1986, in which he reasoned that Bentham's fear of instability caused him to advocate ruthless social engineering and a society in which there could be no privacy or tolerance for the deviant. In the mid-1970s, the panopticon was brought to the wider attention by the French psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller and the French philosopher Michel Foucault. In 1975 Foucault used the panopticon as metaphor for the modern disciplinary society in Discipline and Punish. He argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities, with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system. Foucault first came across the panopticon architecture when he studied the origins of clinical medicine and hospital architecture in the second half of the 18th century. He argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings, and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building, but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology. Foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century, when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals, schools, and later factories. In his historic analysis, Foucault reasoned that with the disappearance of public executions pain had been gradually eliminated as punishment in a society ruled by reason. The modern prison in the 1970s, with its corrective technology, was rooted in the changing legal powers of the state. While acceptance for corporal punishment diminished, the state gained the right to administer more subtle methods of punishment, such as to observe. The French sociologist Henri Lefebvre studied urban space and Foucault's interpretation of the panopticon prison, arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon. Lefebvre contended, that architecture is no more than the relationship between the panopticon, people, and objects. In urban studies, academics such as Marc Schuilenburg now argue that a different self-consciousness arises among humans who live in an urban area. Wall of an industrial building in Donetsk, Ukraine In 1984 Michael Radford gained international attention for the cinematographic panopticon he had staged in the film Nineteen Eighty-Four. Of the telescreens in the landmark surveillance narrative Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), George Orwell said: \\"there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment ... you had to live ... in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised\\". In Radford's film the telescreens were bidirectional and in a world with an ever increasing number of telescreen devices the citizens of Oceania were spied on more than they thought possible. In The Electronic Eye: The Rise of Surveillance Society (1994) the sociologist David Lyon concluded that \\"no single metaphor or model is adequate to the task of summing up what is central to contemporary surveillance, but important clues are available in Nineteen Eighty-Four and in Bentham's panopticon\\". The French philosopher Gilles Deleuze shaped the emerging field of surveillance studies with the 1990 essay Postscript on the Societies of Control. Deleuze argued that the society of control is replacing the discipline society. With regards to the panopticon, Deleuze argued that \\"enclosures are moulds ... but controls are a modulation\\". Deleuze observed that technology had allowed physical enclosures, such as schools, factories, prisons and office buildings, to be replaced by a self-governing machine, which extends surveillance in a quest to manage production and consumption. Information circulates in the control society, just like products in the modern economy, and meaningful objects of surveillance are sought out as forward-looking profiles and simulated pictures of future demands, needs and risks are drawn up. In 1997 Thomas Mathiesen in turn expanded on Foucault's use of the panopticon metaphor when analysing the effects of mass media on society. He argued that mass media such as broadcast television gave many people the ability to view the few from their own homes and gaze upon the lives of reporters and celebrities. Mass media has thus turned the discipline society into a viewer society. In the 1998 satirical science fiction film The Truman Show, the protagonist eventually escapes the OmniCam Ecosphere, the reality television show that, unknown to him, broadcasts his life around the clock and across the globe. But in 2002 Peter Weibel noted that the entertainment industry does not consider the panopticon as a threat or punishment, but as \\"amusement, liberation and pleasure\\". With reference to the Big Brother television shows of Endemol Entertainment, in which a group of people live in a container studio apartment and allow themselves to be recorded constantly, Weibel argued that the panopticon provides the masses with \\"the pleasure of power, the pleasure of sadism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, scopophilia, and narcissism\\". In 2006, Shoreditch TV became available to residents of the Shoreditch in London, so that they could tune in to watch CCTV footage live. The service allowed residents \\"to see what's happening, check out the traffic and keep an eye out for crime\\". In their 2004 book Welcome to the Machine: Science, Surveillance, and the Culture of Control, Derrick Jensen and George Draffan called Bentham \\"one of the pioneers of modern surveillance\\" and argued that his panopticon prison design serves as the model for modern supermaximum security prisons, such as Pelican Bay State Prison in California. In the 2015 book Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, Simone Browne noted that Bentham travelled on a ship carrying slaves as cargo while drafting his panopticon proposal. She argues that the structure of chattel slavery haunts the theory of the panopticon. She proposes that the 1789 plan of the slave ship Brookes should be regarded as the paradigmatic blueprint. Drawing on Didier Bigo's Banopticon, Brown argues that society is ruled by exceptionalism of power, where the state of emergency becomes permanent and certain groups are excluded on the basis of their future potential behaviour as determined through profiling. = Surveillance technology = Closed circuit TV monitoring at the Central Police Control Station, Munich, 1973. Graffiti about video surveillance. The metaphor of the panopticon prison has been employed to analyse the social significance of surveillance by closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in public spaces. In 1990, Mike Davis reviewed the design and operation of a shopping mall, with its centralised control room, CCTV cameras and security guards, and came to the conclusion that it \\"plagiarizes brazenly from Jeremy Bentham's renowned nineteenth-century design\\". In their 1996 study of CCTV camera installations in British cities, Nicholas Fyfe and Jon Bannister called central and local government policies that facilitated the rapid spread of CCTV surveillance a dispersal of an \\"electronic panopticon\\". Particular attention has been drawn to the similarities of CCTV with Bentham's prison design because CCTV technology enabled, in effect, a central observation tower, staffed by an unseen observer. = Employment and management = Shoshana Zuboff used the metaphor of the panopticon in her 1988 book In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power to describe how computer technology makes work more visible. Zuboff examined how computer systems were used for employee monitoring to track the behavior and output of workers. She used the term 'panopticon' because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on, while the manager was able to check their work continuously. Zuboff argued that there is a collective responsibility formed by the hierarchy in the information panopticon that eliminates subjective opinions and judgements of managers on their employees. Because each employee's contribution to the production process is translated into objective data, it becomes more important for managers to be able to analyze the work rather than analyze the people. A call centre worker at his workstation. Foucault's use of the panopticon metaphor shaped the debate on workplace surveillance in the 1970s. In 1981 the sociologist Anthony Giddens expressed scepticism about the ongoing surveillance debate, criticising that \\"Foucault's 'archaeology', in which human beings do not make their own history but are swept along by it, does not adequately acknowledge that those subject to the power ... are knowledgeable agents, who resist, blunt or actively alter the conditions of life.\\" The social alienation of workers and management in the industrialised production process had long been studied and theorised. In the 1950s and 1960s, the emerging behavioural science approach led to skills testing and recruitment processes that sought out employees that would be organisationally committed. Fordism, Taylorism and bureaucratic management of factories was still assumed to reflect a mature industrial society. The Hawthorne Plant experiments (1924‚Äì1933) and a significant number of subsequent empirical studies led to the reinterpretation of alienation: instead of being a given power relationship between the worker and management, it came to be seen as hindering progress and modernity. The increasing employment in the service industries has also been re-evaluated. In Entrapped by the electronic panopticon? Worker resistance in the call centre (2000), Phil Taylor and Peter Bain argue that the large number of people employed in call centres undertake predictable and monotonous work that is badly paid and offers few prospects. As such, they argue, it is comparable to factory work. The panopticon has become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft. Time-theft by workers has become accepted as an output restriction and theft has been associated by management with all behaviour that include avoidance of work. In the past decades \\"unproductive behaviour\\" has been cited as rationale for introducing a range of surveillance techniques and the vilification of employees who resist them. In a 2009 paper by Max Haiven and Scott Stoneman entitled Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of Time and the 2014 book by Simon Head Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans, which describes conditions at an Amazon depot in Augsburg, it is argued that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and quotas in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management. = Social media = The concept of panopticon has been referenced in early discussions about the impact of social media. The notion of dataveillance was coined by Roger Clarke in 1987, since then academic researchers have used expressions such as superpanopticon (Mark Poster 1990), panoptic sort (Oscar H. Gandy Jr. 1993) and electronic panopticon (David Lyon 1994) to describe social media. Because the controlled is at the center and surrounded by those who watch, early surveillance studies treat social media as a reverse panopticon. In modern academic literature on social media, terms like lateral surveillance, social searching, and social surveillance are employed to critically evaluate the effects of social media. However, the sociologist Christian Fuchs treats social media like a classical panopticon. He argues that the focus should not be on the relationship between the users of a medium, but the relationship between the users and the medium. Therefore, he argues that the relationship between the large number of users and the sociotechnical Web 2.0 platform, like Facebook, amounts to a panopticon. Fuchs draws attention to the fact that use of such platforms requires identification, classification and assessment of users by the platforms and therefore, he argues, the definition of privacy must be reassessed to incorporate stronger consumer protection and protection of citizens from corporate surveillance.  The arts and literature  A drawing of the interior design, when The Royal Panopticon of Science and Art opened in 1854. According to professor Donald Preziosi, the panopticon prison of Bentham resonates with the memory theatre of Giulio Camillo, where the sitting observer is at the centre and the phenomena are categorised in an array, which makes comparison, distinction, contrast and variation legible. Among the architectural references Bentham quoted for his panopticon prison was Ranelagh Gardens, a London pleasure garden with a dome built around 1742. At the center of the rotunda beneath the dome was an elevated platform from which a 360 degrees panorama could be viewed, illuminated through skylights. Professor Nicholas Mirzoeff compares the panopticon with the 19th-century diorama, because the architecture is arranged so that the seer views cells or galleries. Ground-plan of the Diorama Building, London 1823. In 1854 the work on the building that was to house the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art in London was completed. The rotunda at the centre of the building was encircled with a 91 meter procession. The interior reflected the taste for religiously meaningless ornament and emerged out of the contemporary taste for recreational learning. Visitors of the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art could view changing exhibits, including vacuum flasks, a pin making machine and a cook stove. However, a competitive entertainment industry emerged in London and despite the varying music, the large fountains, interesting experiments and opportunities for shopping, two years after opening the amateur science panopticon project closed. Panopticon principle lies as the central idea in the plot of We (novel) (Russian: –ú—ã, romanized: My), a dystopian novel by Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin, written 1920‚Äì1921. Zamyatin goes beyond a concept of a single prison and projects panopticon principles to the whole society where people live in buildings with fully transparent walls. Foucault's theories positioned Bentham's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s Europe. This led to the widespread use of the panopticon in literature, comic books, computer games, and TV series. In Doctor Who, an abandoned panopticon was featured.Doctor Who, The Deadly Assassin, Season 14, Serial 3; November 1976 In 1981 the novella Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez on the murder of Santiago Nasar, chapter four is written with a view on the characters through the panopticon prison of Riohacha. Angela Carter, in her 1984 novel Nights at the Circus, linked the panopticon of Countes P to a \\"perverse honeycomb\\" and made the character the matriarchal queen bee. In the 2011 TV series, Person of Interest, Foucault's panopticon is used to grasp the pressure under which the character Harold Finch suffers in the post-9/11 United States of America.

The town was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1874. In 1910 it became one of the six towns that federated to become the County Borough of Stoke-on-Trent and later the City of Stoke-on-Trent. Since federation in 1910 it has the seat of the city's council, though Stoke-on-Trent's city centre is usually regarded as being the nearby town of Hanley which, since federation, has been the most commercially important of the six towns. Name On 1 April 1910, the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. By 1925 the area was granted city status. Confusion can arise over the similarity of this town's name to that of the larger city. If the new borough had to be named after one of the original towns, the main reason for using \\"Stoke\\" is that this was where the new town's administration was sited, which in turn was because Stoke had the main transport links. The river, canal, mainline railway, and trunk road passed through the centre of Stoke. Stoke also had the main railway station (other towns were connected by the \\"loop\\" line) making the name of Stoke perhaps the most familiar outside the area. It made sense to name the city after the oldest and most commonly recognised name, even though it was not then the most significant town from a commercial perspective. (The commercial centre was Hanley, elevated and therefore relatively free, for most of the year, of the city's smog and smoke.) =Renaming proposals= Owing to the confusion between the town of Stoke and the larger city, there have been various calls, mainly amongst business leaders and academics, to rename either the town or the larger city. Proposals for the renamed town include Old Stoke, Stoke Minster and Stoke Town. There are also proposals to rename part of Hanley to Stoke-on-Trent City Centre. Growth of Stoke and its transport links Stoke was located where the upper reaches of the Trent meets the Fowlea Brook. The later Roman road through Stoke remained the basis for local road transport long after the Roman occupation. The Anglian name given to this ancient place of meeting and worship was the 'stoc' (meeting place) on the Trent. It was the site of the first church in the area, built of wood around the year 670 by missionaries from Lindisfarne, later rebuilt in stone, and now known as Stoke Minster. A significant small town grew up around this church. In the 18th century, the \\"Grand Trunk\\" canal came along the Trent valley to carry china clay from Cornwall cheaply to the Potteries (and pottery safely away). Many of the promoters of the canal were pottery magnates. In the 19th century, the railways, too, came along the valley. The mainline Stoke-on-Trent railway station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) on 9 October 1848, replacing the temporary station sited at Whieldon Road which was constructed for the opening of the first NSR line on 17 April 1848. Travellers to the region would change trains at Stoke for local trains to their ticketed destination. King's Hall King's Hall, Stoke The assembly hall, ballroom, exhibition hall and theatre built in 1910‚Äì11 at the time of the federation to the design of T. Wallis and J.A. Bowater and with an impressive 19-bay dressed stone frontage on Kingsway behind the Town Hall. It has proved itself to be a useful adjunct to the Town Hall of 1834‚Äì50. This was built on Glebe Street, opposite the parish church to the design of Henry Ward. The entire Town Hall‚ÄìKing's Hall complex serves the city of Stoke-on-Trent well as its chief administrative offices, including the Lord Mayor's Parlour combined with all the facilities of the King's Hall for the city's formal entertainment.  Stoke Market Stoke has held markets in various locations in the town since 1818. A market was set up within the newly built town hall in the 1830s, but this did not prove popular with the market traders of the time and in 1845 the market moved to Hide Street (the building can still be seen today). In 1883 the market relocated to a larger purpose built building fronting Church Street 'befitting its town status'. This Victorian market was all but destroyed by a fire that started on F.A. Cup final day (22 May 1982).http://www.stoke.gov.uk/ccm/content/leisure-and-culture/markets/stoke- market.en;jsessionid=aUDbagmLmyh_ Only the clock tower, entrance arch, fish section and shop frontage was saved. The current market in South Wolfe Street was opened in 1984. The former market site with its clock tower was block paved for use as an outdoor trading/event space, and a library and one-stop shop has also been added to the site. The Potteries In the 19th century, Stoke had a thriving pottery industry, hence its nickname, \\"The Potteries\\". Since the last half of the 20th century, however, almost all of the bottle- shaped kilns have been taken down, due to regulations from the Clean Air Act ‚Äì an estimated 4,000 bottle kilns in the heyday of the pottery industry, today reduced to a mere 46. Successful Stoke-upon-Trent potters include Spode, Copeland, Minton and Biltons. Stoke today Although Stoke is surpassed by its neighbouring town, Hanley in terms of size, population, and shops, it does have: * Stoke Minster * the same (abbreviated) name as the City * the mainline railway station * the main campus of Staffordshire University and its library (on the original site of the Staffordshire Cricket Club grounds) and the halls of residence (these latter are located on riverside land that was originally part of Hanley). * a long-established purpose-built arthouse cinema, The Film Theatre. * a purpose-built repertory theatre * the Trent & Mersey canal & its National Cycle Network long-distance bicycle paths (NCN Route 5) * the main complex of Council offices & chamber ‚Äì clustered in and around the Town Hall * the EU-funded Stoke Approach area and the outdoor artworks * The King's Hall music & events venue * a free public lending library * the outdoor and indoor markets * The Spode Copeland pottery factory, disused since 2008 but in August 2010 at the start of a ¬£25m regeneration programme. * The Villas, the first conservation area in Stoke, containing several Grade II listed houses * The University Hospital of North Staffordshire and the City General Hospital, as well as the Central Outpatients Department, is nearby.

It is an isomer of butane. Isobutane is a colourless, odourless gas. It is the simplest alkane with a tertiary carbon. Isobutane is used as a precursor molecule in the petrochemical industry, for example in the synthesis of isooctane. Production Isobutane is obtained by isomerization of butane. :240px Uses Isobutane is the principal feedstock in alkylation units of refineries. Using isobutane, gasoline-grade \\"blendstocks\\" are generated with high branching for good combustion characteristics. Typical products from isobutane are 2,4-dimethylpentane and especially 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. Typical acid-catalyzed route to 2,4-dimethylpentane. =Solvent= In the Chevron Phillips slurry process for making high-density polyethylene, isobutane is used as a diluent. As the slurried polyethylene is removed, isobutane is \\"flashed\\" off, and condensed, and recycled back into the loop reactor for this purpose. =Precursor to tert-Butyl hydroperoxide= Isobutane is oxidized to tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, which is subsequently reacted with propylene to yield propylene oxide. The tert-butanol that results as a by-product is typically used to make gasoline additives such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). =Miscellaneous uses= Isobutane is also used as a propellant for aerosol cans. Isobutane is used as part of blended fuels, especially common in fuel canisters used for camping. Refrigerant Isobutane is used as a refrigerant. Their use in refrigerators started in 1993 when Greenpeace presented the Greenfreeze project with the German company Foron. In this regard, blends of pure, dry \\"isobutane\\" (R-600a) (that is, isobutane mixtures) have negligible ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential (having a value of 3.3 times the GWP of carbon dioxide) and can serve as a functional replacement for R-12, R-22 (both of these being commonly known by the trademark Freon), R-134a, and other chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems. As a refrigerant, isobutane poses an explosion risk in addition to the hazards associated with non-flammable CFC refrigerants. Substitution of this refrigerant for motor vehicle air conditioning systems not originally designed for isobutane is widely prohibited or discouraged.VASA on refrigerant legality & advisability Vendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons. Nomenclature The traditional name isobutane was still retained in the 1993 IUPAC recommendations, http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_679.htm but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations. Since the longest continuous chain in isobutane contains only three carbon atoms, the preferred IUPAC name is 2-methylpropane but the locant (2-) is typically omitted in general nomenclature as redundant; C2 is the only position on a propane chain where a methyl substituent can be located without altering the main chain and forming the constitutional isomer n-butane.

Biography Morley was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Anna Clarissa Treat and the Reverend Sardis Brewster Morley. Both parents were of early colonial ancestry and of purely British origin. He grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut. During his childhood, he suffered much from ill health and was therefore educated by his father at home until the age of nineteen. In 1857 Morley entered Williams College at Williamstown, Massachusetts, his father's alma mater. He received his A.B. in 1860 and his master's degree in 1863. Around 1860 he gradually shifted his attention from chemistry, which fascinated him since he was child, to optics and astronomy. In 1860‚Äì61 he mounted a transit instrument, constructed a chronograph, and made the first accurate determination of the latitude of the college observatory. This determination was the subject of his first published paper, which was read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1866. Upon advice of his parents, Morley entered Andover Theological Seminary in 1861, finishing in 1864. It was here, probably, that he acquired a good working knowledge of Hebrew. From 1866 to 1868 he was a teacher in a private school and later, in 1868, he was called to preach in a small country parish in Ohio. At about the same time, he was appointed professor of chemistry in Western Reserve College (then situated at Hudson, Ohio and later moved to Cleveland and renamed Case Western Reserve University), where he remained until his retirement in 1906. This appointment was the turning point in his career. In 1873 he also became professor of chemistry in Cleveland Medical College, but resigned this chair in 1888 to have more time for research. Just before moving to Hudson he married Miss Imbella A. Birdsall. During his residence in Cleveland, Morley assembled one of the best private collections of chemical periodicals in America. He even included Russian journals and learned enough of the Russian language to use them. After his retirement from teaching, the university purchased his library and relocated to the chemical laboratory named after him. In 1906, he moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, where he built a small house and a laboratory for his personal studies of rocks and minerals. Morley was not a voluminous writer and published only 55 articles. He outlived his wife by only a few months and, following a surgical operation, died in the Hartford Hospital in 1923. Research =Optics and astronomy= Morley's most-significant work came in the field of physics and optics. In this, he collaborated with and assisted the physicist Albert A. Michelson for several years around 1887. They set up, executed, and improved their techniques many times in what we call the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. This involved making more and more accurate measurements of the speed of light in various directions, and at different times of the year, as the Earth revolved in its orbit around the Sun. These careful measurements were created to measure the differences in the speed of light in different directions. Michelson and Morley always found that the speed of light did not vary at all depending on the direction of measurement, or the position of the Earth in its orbit, deducing what we call a \\"null result\\" for their speed-of-light experiments. Neither he nor Michelson ever considered that these null results disproved the hypothesis of the existence of \\"luminiferous aether\\", in which electromagnetic waves were thought to be propagated. Their null results led the Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald to postulate what we now call the FitzGerald‚ÄìLorentz contraction of physical objects in the direction of their movement in inertial frames of reference. However, other scientists did come to the conclusion that the aether did not exist. The results of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiments supported Albert Einstein's strong postulate in 1905 that the speed of light is a constant in all inertial frames of reference for his Special Theory of Relativity. Morley also collaborated with Dayton Miller on positive aether experiments after his work with Michelson. Morley himself made measurements of the speed of light when it passes through a strong magnetic field. He also studied the thermal expansion of solid materials. =Chemistry= At Western Reserve College, Morley was required to teach, not only chemistry, but also geology and botany, leaving him little time for research. Nevertheless, he found time during the first ten years at Hudson to publish five articles, mostly on the accuracy of measurements. In chemistry, his original field, Morley had worked on determining accurate values for the composition of the atmosphere and the weights of its gases. His work on the atomic weight of oxygen covered a period of eleven years. Much time was spent in the calibration of instruments and improving the measurement accuracy to the highest possible degree (ca. 1 part per 10,000). In 1895 he introduced a new value for the atomic weight ratio of oxygen to hydrogen, providing the most precise determination of the atomic weight of oxygen at the time. His research on the atomic weight of oxygen was recognized as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in 1995. Honors Morley was the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1895 and he was the president of the American Chemical Society in 1899. He was awarded the Davy Medal, named for the great British chemist Sir Humphry Davy, by the Royal Society of London in 1907. He also won the Elliott Cresson Medal, awarded by the Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania, in 1912, for important contributions to the science of chemistry. He received the Willard Gibbs Award of the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society in 1917. The lunar crater Morley on the near side was named for him. The Morley Elementary School in West Hartford, Connecticut, was also named for him, as was the Morley Scientific Laboratory on the Williams College campus. His house in West Hartford was made a National Historic Landmark in 1975.

An antenna spire with a signal light on top gives the tower a total height of . It is the tallest building in Frankfurt and the tallest building in Germany. It had been the tallest building in Europe from its completion in 1997 until 2003 when it was surpassed by the Triumph-Palace in Moscow. Since the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the tower has reclaimed its position as the tallest building in the European Union. The Commerzbank Tower is only two metres taller than the Messeturm, which is also located in Frankfurt and was the tallest building in Europe before the construction of the Commerzbank Tower. Commerzbank Tower was designed by Foster & Partners, with Arup and Krebs & Kiefer (structural engineering), J. Roger Preston with P&A; Petterson Ahrens (mechanical engineering), Schad & H√∂lzel (electrical engineering). Construction of the building began in 1994 and took three years to complete. The building provides of office space for the Commerzbank headquarters, including winter gardens and natural lighting and air circulation. The building is lighted at night with a yellow lighting scheme that was designed by Thomas Ende who was allowed to display this sequence as a result of a competition. In its immediate neighbourhood are other skyscrapers including the Eurotower (former home of the European Central Bank), the Main Tower, the Silberturm, the Japan Center and the Gallileo. The area forms Frankfurt's central business district, commonly known as Bankenviertel.  Features  Garden on the 19th floor of Commerzbank Tower When the building was planned in the early 1990s, Frankfurt's Green Party, who governed the city together with the Social Democratic Party, encouraged the Commerzbank to design a 'green' skyscraper. The result was the world's first so-called ecological skyscraper: besides the use of 'sky-gardens', environmentally friendly technologies were employed to reduce energy required for heating and cooling. =Sky gardens= Commerzbank Tower is shaped as a wide rounded equilateral triangle with a central, triangular atrium. At nine different levels, the atrium opens up to one of the three sides, forming large sky gardens. These open areas allow more natural light in the building, reducing the need for artificial lighting. At the same time it ensures offices in the building's two other sides have a view of either the city or the garden. In order to eliminate the need of supporting columns in the sky gardens, the building was constructed in steel rather than the conventional (and cheaper) concrete. It was the first skyscraper in Germany where steel was used as the main construction material.

It has an urban population of The town is built around an inlet called Queenstown Bay on Lake Wakatipu, a long, thin, Z-shaped lake formed by glacial processes, and has views of nearby mountains such as The Remarkables, Cecil Peak, Walter Peak and just above the town, Ben Lomond and Queenstown Hill.

Queenstown is known for its commerce-oriented tourism, especially adventure and ski tourism. History =MƒÅori settlement and presence= The area was discovered and first settled by MƒÅori before non- MƒÅori arrived. The first non-MƒÅori to see Lake Wakatipu was European Nathanael Chalmers who was guided by Reko, the chief of the Tuturau, over the Waimea Plains and up the Mataura River in September 1853.Miller., F.W.G., (1949), Golden Days of Lake County. Whitcombe and Tombs. p 3-11. Evidence of stake nets, baskets for catching eels, spears and ashes indicated the Glenorchy area was visited by MƒÅori. It is likely NgƒÅi Tahu MƒÅori visited Queenstown en route to collect Pounamu (greenstone). A settlement called Te Kirikiri Pa was occupied by the tribe of KƒÅti MƒÅmoe which was situated where the Queenstown Gardens are today, but by the time European migrants arrived in the 1860s this settlement was no longer being used. =Subsequent European settlers= European explorers William Gilbert Rees and Nicholas von Tunzelmann were the first non-Maoris to settle the area. Rees established a high country farm in the location of Queenstown's current town centre in 1860, but the discovery of gold in the Arrow River in 1862 encouraged Rees to convert his wool shed into a hotel named the Queen's Arms, now known as Eichardt's. Many Queenstown streets bear names from the gold mining era (such as Camp Street) and some historic buildings remain. William's Cottage, the Lake Lodge of Ophir (now Artbay Gallery), Queenstown Police Station, and St Peter's Anglican Church lie close together in a designated historic precinct. =Naming= There are various apocryphal accounts of how Queenstown was named, however the following is the most likely: When William Rees first arrived in the area and built his homestead, the area was known as The Station although miners soon referred to it as The Camp from 1860 to 1862. The miners, and especially the Irish, had taken an interest in the ceremony held for a town called Cobh in Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom) which was renamed Queenstown in honour of Queen Victoria in 1850. They may have had their own ceremony at the intersection of Rees and Beach Streets replicating some of the elements in the renaming of the Irish town. There was then a public meeting to name the township on the lake in January 1863 (probably the weekend of the 3rd and 4th) in which the town was officially given the name of Queenstown in reference to Ireland's Queenstown. By 9 and 10 January 1863 the town was being reported with the name of Queenstown in several reports written by a correspondent in the Otago Witness on 5 and 6 January. During the meeting there may have been a reference by a miner to the town being \\"fit for a Queen\\" (this is one of the most popular accounts of how the town was named). TƒÅhuna, the MƒÅori-language name for Queenstown, means \\"shallow bay\\". Geography Queenstown is situated on the shore of Lake Wakatipu, the third largest lake by surface area in New Zealand. The town is located close to the lake's northeastern bend, at which point a small arm, the Frankton Arm, joins the lake with its principal outflow, the Kawarau River. The centre of the town is on the north shore at the point where the Frankton Arm links with the main body of the lake, but also extends to the major suburb of Frankton at the eastern end of the arm, and across to Kelvin Heights on the Kelvin Peninsula, which forms the Frankton Arm's southern shore. The town is at a relatively low altitude for a ski and snowboarding centre, at above sea level at the lake shore, but is nestled among mountains, most notably the scenic attraction of The Remarkables, to the town's southeast. Below the lake lies the deep Kawarau Gorge, and there are nearby plains suitable for agriculture and viticulture. Queenstown lies close to the heart of the Central Otago wine region. =Suburbs= Central Queenstown contains many businesses, apartments and homes but is near many suburbs or large areas of housing: Fernhill, Sunshine Bay, Queenstown Hill, Goldfield Heights, Marina Heights, Kelvin Heights, Arthurs Point and Frankton. Just outside Queenstown are the areas of: Arrowtown, Closeburn, Dalefield, Gibbston, Jack's Point, Hanley's Farm, Hayes Creek, Lake Hayes Estate, Shotover Country and Quail Rise. Housing in Queenstown (top) and Kelvin Heights (bottom) =Climate= Because of its relatively moderate altitude (310 metres) and high mountain surroundings, Queenstown has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb). Summer has long warm days with temperatures that can reach 30 ¬∞C while winters are cold with temperatures often in single digits with frequent snowfall, although there is no permanent snow cover during the year. As with the rest of Central Otago, Queenstown lies within the rain shadow of the Southern Alps, but being closer to the west coast the town is more susceptible to rain-bearing fronts than nearby Cromwell, Wanaka and Alexandra. The hottest recorded temperature in Queenstown is , while the coldest is . (from the NIWA website) Demography Queenstown has an urban population of making it the 35th-largest urban area in New Zealand. In 2016, Queenstown overtook Oamaru to become the second-largest urban area in Otago, behind Dunedin. The Queenstown urban area as defined by Statistics New Zealand doens't include Lake Hayes or Arthurs Point, which are contiguous with Queenstown but are designated as separate urban areas. The combined population of the three urban areas is . The Queenstown urban area had a usual resident population of 13,533 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,202 people (19.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3,111 people (29.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 7,089 males and 6,444 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.10 males per female. Of the total population, 1,341 people (9.9%) were aged up to 15 years, 4,890 (36.1%) were 15 to 29, 6,267 (46.3%) were 30 to 64, and 1,035 (7.6%) were 65 or older. Ethnicities were 71.2% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 4.5% MƒÅori, 1.2% Pacific peoples, 17.8% Asian, and 10.6% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). Economy =Growth and affordability= Residential housing in the Queenstown area is quite expensive due to factors such as the town being a tourist destination, its lack of land and its desirability to foreigners and investors. Queenstown is rated the least affordable place in New Zealand to buy a property, overtaking Auckland at the start of 2017. In December 2016 the average house price in the Queenstown area rose to $1 million NZD. =Employment= The area‚Äôs growth rate is one of the fastest in the country with the population growing 7.1% from 2015 to 2016 in a 12-month period. Most jobs in Queenstown are tourism- or accommodation-related. Employment growth was also the highest of any area in New Zealand at 10.3% in the March 2016 year. Tourism The Queenstown Mall in winter Remarkable Mountains The Ledge Bungy A resort town, Queenstown boasted 220 adventure tourism activities in 2012. Skiing and snowboarding, jet boating, whitewater rafting, bungy jumping, mountain biking, skateboarding, tramping, paragliding, sky diving and fly fishing are all popular. Queenstown is a major centre for snow sports in New Zealand, with people from all over the country and many parts of the world travelling to ski at the four main mountain ski fields (Cardrona Alpine Resort, Coronet Peak, The Remarkables and Treble Cone). Cross country skiing is also available at the Waiorau Snowfarm, near Cardrona village. The 100-year-old twin screw coal fired steamer TSS Earnslaw traverses Lake Wakatipu.

The lakes of the Wakatipu appear ominous, and the Southern Alps spectacular. The main location is Moke Lake and scenes were shot on Lower Beach Street and Coronation Drive, and at a supermarket and bottle store on Shotover Street. In 2010, Cycle 14 of America's Next Top Model, was, in part filmed in Queenstown and was as won by Krista White. Raina Hein was runner-up. Queenstown and the surrounding area contain many locations used in the filming of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Locations used include Paradise near Glenorchy, at the head of Lake Wakatipu. Queenstown became popular in South Asia after the release of Bollywood blockbuster Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, which was partially shot there.

ACE Wakatipu has a community focus, and provides links to many adult training opportunities.  Infrastructure  = Transport = Queenstown is accessible by road and air but not by rail (similar to Kaitaia, Taupo and Nelson). As a resort centre, many bus services operate into Queenstown, mostly for package tours, but daily services for locals and others are available to and from Invercargill, Dunedin and Christchurch, the main cities closest to Queenstown. Bee Cards are to replace GoCards on local buses on 15 September 2020. Queenstown Airport takes flights from Australia by airlines Air New Zealand, Qantas, Virgin Australia and Jetstar and has destinations that include Brisbane, Gold Coast, Melbourne and Sydney (the frequency is much increased over the ski season and during summer). Domestic flights fly to Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington. Queenstown Airport is New Zealand's busiest helicopter base, also the fourth-busiest airport by passenger traffic, and is also heavily used for tourist 'flightseeing', especially to Milford Sound and Mount Cook, using both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. The primary road access to the Queenstown area is via (SH6), from Cromwell through the Kawarau Gorge to Frankton, where a 9 km spur (SH6A) leads to the CBD and connects with the Glenorchy Road. SH6 continues south, crossing the Kawarau river before heading down the eastern side of Lake Wakatipu to Kingston before crossing the provincial boundary and emerging on the plains of Southland, terminating in the city of Invercargill. A difficult road over the Crown Range leads to Cardrona skifield and Wanaka, and is New Zealand's highest paved public road pass. Queenstown is the departure point for a large number of bus day trips to Milford Sound, which entails a return trip of approximately 12 hours. There are scenic flights available to and from Milford Sound. A return flight, including a two-hour cruise, is approximately four hours. = Utilities = Electricity distribution in Queenstown is the responsibility of two companies, Dunedin-based Aurora Energy and Invercargill-based Powernet. Electricity is supplied from Transpower's national grid at its substation in Frankton, which in turn is fed by a twin-circuit 110,000-volt line from Transpower's Cromwell substation. Queenstown was one of the last towns in New Zealand with a manual telephone exchange, whereby all calls had to be connected by an operator. The town was upgraded to a fully automatic exchange in 1988. Fibre to the premises was rolled-out in Queenstown as part of the Fifth National Government's Ultra- Fast Broadband programme, with the rollout completed in July 2016.

His major philosophical essay was The Tragic Sense of Life (1912), and his most famous novel was Abel S√°nchez: The History of a Passion (1917), a modern exploration of the Cain and Abel story. Biography Unamuno was often in the terrace of the Caf√© Novelty, founded in 1905, in the Plaza Mayor of Salamanca. Miguel de Unamuno was born in Bilbao, a port city of the Basque Country, Spain, the son of F√©lix de Unamuno and Salom√© Jugo. As a young man, he was interested in the Basque language, which he could speak, and competed for a teaching position in the Instituto de Bilbao against Sabino Arana. The contest was finally won by the Basque scholar Resurrecci√≥n Mar√≠a de Azkue. Unamuno worked in all major genres: the essay, the novel, poetry, and theater, and, as a modernist, contributed greatly to dissolving the boundaries between genres. There is some debate as to whether Unamuno was in fact a member of the Generation of '98, an ex post facto literary group of Spanish intellectuals and philosophers that was the creation of Jos√© Mart√≠nez Ruiz (Azor√≠n) ‚Äî a group that includes, besides Azor√≠n, Antonio Machado, Ram√≥n P√©rez de Ayala, P√≠o Baroja, Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n, Ramiro de Maeztu, and √Ångel Ganivet, among others. Unamuno would have preferred to be a philosophy professor, but was unable to get an academic appointment; philosophy was in Spain somewhat politicized. Instead he became a Greek professor. In 1901 Unamuno gave his well-known conference on the scientific and literary inviability of the Basque. According to Azurmendi, Unamuno went against the Basque language once his political views changed as a result of his reflection on Spain.Azurmendi, Joxe: Espainiaren arimaz, 2006. pp. 101-46. Azurmendi adds that Unamuno analyzed and rejected the Basque problem from a 19th century point of view In addition to his writing, Unamuno played an important role in the intellectual life of Spain. He served as rector of the University of Salamanca for two periods: from 1900 to 1924 and 1930 to 1936, during a time of great social and political upheaval. During the 1910s and 1920s, he became one of the most passionate advocates of Spanish liberalism. Unamuno linked his liberalism with his hometown of Bilbao, which, through its commerce and connection with the civilized world, Unamuno believed had developed an individualism and independent outlook in stark contrast to the narrow-mindedness of Carlist traditionalism. When in 1912 Jos√© Canalejas was assassinated by an anarchist, he blamed it on the fact that Spain lacked a \\"true liberal democratic party\\" and in 1914 denounced the large property owners for their negligence and ignorance. Along with many other Spanish writers and intellectuals, such as Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, he was an outspoken supporter of the Allied cause during the First World War despite Spain's official neutrality. Unamuno viewed the war as a crusade not just against the bellicose authoritarianism of the Germans, but against their sympathizers in Spain, and intensified his attacks on Alfonso XIII and the Spanish monarchy. Unamuno was removed from his two university chairs by the dictator General Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1924, over the protests of other Spanish intellectuals. As a result of his vociferous criticisms of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, he lived in exile until 1930, first banished to Fuerteventura, one of the Canary Islands; his house there is now a museum, as is his house in Salamanca. From Fuerteventura he escaped to France, as related in his book De Fuerteventura a Paris. After a year in Paris, Unamuno established himself in Hendaye, a border town in the French Basque Country, as close to Spain as he could get while remaining in France. Unamuno returned to Spain after the fall of General Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in 1930 and took up his rectorship again. It is said in Salamanca that the day he returned to the University, Unamuno began his lecture by saying \\"As we were saying yesterday...\\" (Dec√≠amos ayer...) as Fray Luis de Le√≥n had done in the same place in 1576, after four years of imprisonment by the Inquisition. It was as though he had not been absent at all. After the fall of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, Spain embarked on its Second Republic. He was a candidate on the Republican/Socialist ticket and was elected, after which he led a large demonstration in the Plaza Mayor in which he raised the Republic's flag and declared its victory. He always was a moderate and refused all political and anticlerical extremisms. In a speech delivered on 28 November 1932, at the Madrid Ateneo, he protested against Aza√±a's extremist anti-clerical rulling: \`Even the Inquisition was limited by certain legal guarantees. But now we have something worse: a police force which is grounded only on a general sense of panic and on the invention of non-existent dangers to cover up this over- stepping of the law. Unamuno's dislike for Manuel Aza√±a' ruling went so far as to tell a reporter who published his statement in El Adelanto in June of 1936 that President Manuel Aza√±a should commit suicide as a patriotic act\\". The Republican government had a serious problem with Unamuno‚Äôs statements, and on 22 August 1936, they decreed that Unamuno should once again be removed from his position as rector of the university. Moreover, the government removed his name from streets and replaced it with the name of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Having begun his literary career as an internationalist, Unamuno gradually became convinced of the universal values of Spanish culture, feeling that Spain's essential qualities would be destroyed if influenced too much by outside forces. Thus he initially welcomed Franco's revolt as necessary to rescue Spain from the excesses of the Second Republic. When a journalist questioned how he could side with the military and \\"abandon a Republic that [he] helped create,\\" Unamuno responded, it \\"is not a fight against the liberal Republic, but a fight for civilization. What Madrid represents now is not socialism or democracy, or even communism\\"Blanco-Prieto F.- Unamuno y la Guerra Civil. Cuadernos de la C√°tedra Miguel de Unamuno [Internet]. (2011) However, the harsh tactics employed by the Francoists in the struggle against their republican opponents caused him to oppose both the Republic and Franco. Unamuno said of the military revolt that it would be the victory of \\"a brand of Catholicism that is not Christian and of a paranoid militarism bred in the colonial campaigns,\\" referring in the latter case to the 1921 war with Abd el- Krim in what was then Spanish Morocco, (Franco's 1936 revolt also started from Spanish Morocco). Sculpture of Unamuno in Salamanca by Pablo Serrano in 1968. In 1936 Unamuno had a public quarrel with the Nationalist general Mill√°n Astray at the university in which he denounced both Astray‚Äîwith whom he had had verbal battles in the 1920s‚Äîand elements of the rebel movement. Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was effectively removed for a second time from the rectorship of the University of Salamanca. A few days later he confided to Nikos Kazantzakis: On 21 November, he wrote to the Italian philosopher Lorenzo Giusso that \\"The barbarism is unanimous. It is a regime of terror on both sides.\\" In one of his final letters, dated 13 December, he condemned the atrocities being committed by Franco's forces in terms that would become famous: Broken-hearted, he was placed under house arrest by Franco, and his death followed on 31 December. Unamuno died while sleeping, which he regarded as the best and most painless way to die. Unamuno was probably the best Spanish connoisseur of Portuguese culture, literature, and history of his time. He believed it was as important for a Spaniard to become familiar with the great names of Portuguese literature as with those of Catalan literature. He was also a supporter of Iberian Federalism. In the final analysis Unamuno's significance is that he was one of a number of notable interwar intellectuals, along with luminaries such as Julien Benda, Karl Jaspers, Johan Huizinga, and Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, who resisted the intrusion of ideology into Western intellectual life.Sean Farrell Moran, \\"The Disease of Human Consciousness,\\" in Oakland Journal, 12, 2007, 103‚Äì110. Fiction * Paz en la guerra (Peace in War) (1897) ‚Äî a novel that explores the relationship of self and world through familiarity with death. It is based on his experiences as a child during the Carlist siege of Bilbao in the Third Carlist War. * Amor y pedagog√≠a (Love and Pedagogy) (1902) ‚Äî a novel uniting comedy and tragedy in an absurd parody of positivist sociology. * El espejo de la muerte (The Mirror of Death) (1913) ‚Äî a collection of stories. Balc√≥n de Unamuno, Artenara, Spain * Niebla (Mist) (1914) ‚Äî one of Unamuno's key works, which he called a nivola to distinguish it from the supposedly fixed form of the novel (novela in Spanish). * Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho (usually translated into English as Our Lord Don Quixote) (1914) ‚Äî another key work of Unamuno, often perceived as one of the earliest works applying existential elements to Don Quixote. The book, on Unamuno's own admission, is of mixed genre with elements of personal essay, philosophy, and fiction. Unamuno felt that Miguel de Cervantes had not told the story of Don Quijote very well, cluttering it with unrelated tales. Unamuno intended this work to present Cervantes' story the way it should have been written. He felt that as a quijotista (a fan or student of Don Quixote) he was superior to Cervantes. The work is primarily of interest to those studying Unamuno, not Cervantes. * Abel S√°nchez (1917) ‚Äî a novel that uses the story of Cain and Abel to explore envy. * Tulio Montalb√°n (1920) ‚Äî a short novel on the threat of a man's public image undoing his true personality, a problem familiar to the famous Unamuno. * Tres novelas ejemplares y un pr√≥logo (Three Exemplary Novels and a Prologue) (1920) ‚Äî a much-studied work with a famous prologue. The title deliberately recalls the famous Novelas ejemplares of Miguel de Cervantes. * La t√≠a Tula (Aunt Tula) (1921) ‚Äî his final large-scale novel, a work about maternity, a theme that he had already examined in Amor y pedagog√≠a and Dos madres. * Teresa (1924) ‚Äî a narrative work that contains romantic poetry, achieving an ideal through the re-creation of the beloved. * C√≥mo se hace una novela (How to Make a Novel) (1927) ‚Äî the autopsy of an Unamuno novel. * Don Sandalio, jugador de ajedrez (Don Sandalio, Chess Player) (1930). * San Manuel Bueno, m√°rtir (Saint Emmanuel the Good, Martyr) (1930) ‚Äî a brief novella that synthesizes virtually all of Unamuno's thought. The novella centres on a heroic priest who has lost his faith in immortality, yet says nothing of his doubts to his parishioners, not wanting to disturb their faith, which he recognizes is a necessary support for their lives. Philosophy Unamuno seen by Ramon Casas (MNAC). Unamuno's philosophy was not systematic but rather a negation of all systems and an affirmation of faith \\"in itself.\\" He developed intellectually under the influence of rationalism and positivism, but during his youth he wrote articles that clearly show his sympathy for socialism and his great concern for the situation in which he found Spain at the time. An important concept for Unamuno was intrahistoria. He thought that history could best be understood by looking at the small histories of anonymous people, rather than by focusing on major events such as wars and political pacts. Some authors relativize the importance of intrahistoria in his thinking. Those authors say that more than a clear concept is an ambiguous metaphor. The term first appears in the essay En torno al casticismo (1895), but Unamuno leaves it soon.Azurmendi, Joxe: Espainiaren arimaz, 2006. p. 90. In the late nineteenth century Unamuno suffered a religious crisis and left the positivist philosophy. Then, in the early twentieth century, he developed his own thinking influenced by existentialism.Azurmendi, Joxe: \\"Unamunoren atarian\\" in: Alaitz Aizpuru, Euskal Herriko pentsamenduaren gida, 2012. p. 40. Life was tragic, according to Unamuno, because of the knowledge that we are to die. He explains much of human activity as an attempt to survive, in some form, after our death. Unamuno summarized his personal creed thus: \\"My religion is to seek for truth in life and for life in truth, even knowing that I shall not find them while I live.\\"Miguel de Unamuno, \\"Mi religi√≥n\\" (1907) He said, \\"Among men of flesh and bone there have been typical examples of those who possess this tragic sense of life. I recall now Marcus Aurelius, St. Augustine, Pascal, Rousseau, Ren√©, Obermann, Thomson, Leopardi, Vigny, Lenau, Kleist, Amiel, Quental, Kierkegaard‚Äîmen burdened with wisdom rather than with knowledge.\\"Tragic Sense Of Life, I The Man Of Flesh And Bone He provides a stimulating discussion of the differences between faith and reason in his most famous work: Del sentimiento tr√°gico de la vida (The Tragic Sense of Life, 1912). A historically influential paperfolder from childhood to his last, difficult days, in several works Unamuno ironically expressed philosophical views of Platonism, scholasticism, positivism, and the \\"science vs religion\\" issue in terms of \\"origami\\" figures, notably the traditional Spanish pajarita. Since he was also a linguist (professor of Greek), he coined the word \\"cocotolog√≠a\\" (\\"cocotology\\") to describe the art of paper folding. After the conclusion of Amor y pedagog√≠a (Love and Pedagogy, 1902), he included in the volume, attributing it to one of the characters, \\"Notes for a Treatise on Cocotology\\" (\\"Apuntes para un tratado de cocotolog√≠a\\").For a bird-figure folded by him in November 1936, see Vicente Palacios, Papirogami: Tradicional Arte del Papel Plegado (Barcelona: Miguel Salvatella, 1972), p. 122. Along with The Tragic Sense of Life, Unamuno's long-form essay La agon√≠a del cristianismo (The Agony of Christianity, 1931) and his novella San Manuel Bueno, m√°rtir (Saint Emmanuel the Good, Martyr, 1930) were all included on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.John A. Mackay, The Meaning of Life: Christian Truth and Social Change in Latin America (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2014), p. 158. After his youthful sympathy for socialism ended, Unamuno gravitated towards liberalism. Unamuno's conception of liberalism, elaborated in essays such as La esencia del liberalismo in 1909, was one that sought to reconcile a great respect for individual freedom with a more interventionist state, bringing him to a position closer to social liberalism. In writing about the Church in 1932 during the second Spanish Republic, Unamuno urged the clergy to end their attacks on liberalism and instead embrace it as a way of rejuvenating the faith. Unamuno's 'p√°jaro sabio' (wise bird) Poetry For Unamuno, the art of poetry was a way of expressing spiritual problems. His themes were the same in his poetry as in his other fiction: spiritual anguish, the pain provoked by the silence of God, time and death. Unamuno was always attracted to traditional meters and, though his early poems did not rhyme, he subsequently turned to rhyme in his later works. Among his outstanding works of poetry are: * Poes√≠as (Poems) (1907) ‚Äî his first collection of poetry, in which he outlined the themes that would dominate his poetics: religious conflict, Spain, and domestic life * Rosario de sonetos l√≠ricos (Rosary of Lyric Sonnets) (1911) * El Cristo de Vel√°zquez (The Christ of Vel√°zquez) (1920) ‚Äî a religious work, divided into four parts, where Unamuno analyzes the figure of Christ from different perspectives: as a symbol of sacrifice and redemption, as a reflection on his Biblical names (Christ the myth, Christ the man on the cross, Christ, God, Christ the Eucharist), as poetic meaning, as painted by Diego Vel√°zquez, etc. * Andanzas y visiones espa√±olas (1922) ‚Äî something of a travel book, in which Unamuno expresses profound emotion and experiments with landscape both evocative and realistic (a theme typical of his generation of writers) * Rimas de dentro (Rhymes from Within) (1923) * Rimas de un poeta desconocido (Rhymes from an Unknown Poet) (1924) * De Fuerteventura a Par√≠s (From Fuerteventura to Paris) (1925) * Romancero del destierro (Ballads of Exile) (1928) * Cancionero (Songbook) (1953, published posthumously) Drama Unamuno's dramatic production presents a philosophical progression. Questions such as individual spirituality, faith as a \\"vital lie\\", and the problem of a double personality were at the center of La esfinge (The Sphinx) (1898), and La verdad (Truth), (1899). In 1934, he wrote El hermano Juan o El mundo es teatro (Brother Juan or The World is a Theatre). Unamuno's theatre is schematic; he did away with artifice and focused only on the conflicts and passions that affect the characters. This austerity was influenced by classical Greek theatre. What mattered to him was the presentation of the drama going on inside of the characters, because he understood the novel as a way of gaining knowledge about life. By symbolizing passion and creating a theatre austere both in word and presentation, Unamuno's theatre opened the way for the renaissance of Spanish theatre undertaken by Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n, Azor√≠n, and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Confrontation with Mill√°n Astray On 12 October 1936, the Spanish Civil War had been underway for just under three months; the celebration of Columbus Day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Mart√≠nez-Vald√©s, the wife of Franco, Falangist General Jos√© Mill√°n Astray and Unamuno himself. Unamuno had supported Franco's uprising because he believed it necessary to bring order to the anarchy created by the Popular Front, and that day he was representing General Franco in the event. By then the Republican Government had removed Unamuno from his perpetual rectory at the Salamanca University and the rebel government had restored him. There are different versions of the account = The Portillo/Thomas version = According to the British historian Hugh Thomas in his magnum opus The Spanish Civil War (1961), the evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as \\"cancers on the body of the nation,\\" adding that \\"Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism.\\" From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto \\"¬°Viva la Muerte!\\" [Long live death!]. As was his habit, Mill√°n Astray responded with \\"¬°Espa√±a!\\" [Spain!]; the crowd replied with \\"¬°Una!\\" [One!]. He repeated \\"¬°Espa√±a!\\"; the crowd then replied \\"¬°Grande!\\" [Great!]. A third time, Mill√°n Astray shouted \\"¬°Espa√±a!\\"; the crowd responded \\"Libre!\\" [Free!] This ‚Äì Spain, one, great and free ‚Äì was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. Unamuno, who was presiding over the meeting, rose up slowly and addressed the crowd: Unamuno gestured to the Archbishop of Salamanca, Mill√°n Astray responded: \\"Death to intelligence! Long live death!\\" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pem√°n, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed \\"No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!\\" Unamuno continued: \\"This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win [vencer√©is], because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince [pero no convencer√©is]. In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken.\\" Mill√°n Astray, controlling himself, shouted \\"Take the lady's arm!\\" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection. = The Severiano Delgado version = In 2018, the details of Unamuno's speech were disputed by the historian Severiano Delgado, who argued that the account in a 1941 article by Luis Gabriel Portillo (who was not present at Salamanca) in the British magazine Horizon may not have been an accurate representation of events. Severiano Delgado, a historian and librarian at the University of Salamanca, asserts that Unamuno‚Äôs words were put in his mouth by Luis Portillo, in 1941, possibly with some help from George Orwell, in a piece in the literary magazine Horizon, entitled Unamuno‚Äôs Last Lecture. Portillo had not witnessed the event. Severiano Delgado's book, titled \\"Archeology of a Myth: The act of October 12, 1936 in the auditorium of the University of Salamanca,\\" shows how the propaganda myth arose regarding the confrontation that took place that day between Miguel de Unamuno and the general Mill√°n Astray. Delgado agrees that a \\"very fierce and violent verbal confrontation\\" between Unamuno and Mill√°n Astray definitely occurred, which led to Unamuno being removed from his rectorship, but he thinks that the famous speech attributed to Unamuno was invented and written by Luis Portillo.\\" Delgado says that: Unamuno took the floor, not to confront Mill√°n Astray, but to answer a previous speech by Professor of Literature Francisco Maldonado who had identified Catalonia and the Basque Country with the \\"antispa√±a.\\" Unamuno himself was Basque and was revolted with Francisco Maldonado's speech, but when addressing the audience, Unamuno used the example of what had happened with Jos√© Rizal (a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution). Mill√°n Astray had fought in the Philippines and it was the reference to Jos√© Rizal that annoyed Mill√°n Astray, who shouted \\"The traitoring intellectuals die\\". As proof that the incident was nothing more than a crossroads of hard words, the photograph reproduced on the cover of his book shows Mill√°n Astray and Miguel de Unamuno calmly saying goodbye in the presence of Bishop Pl√†, with no tension between them. The photo was discovered in 2018 in the National Library and was part of the chronicle of the act that the newspaper \\"The Advancement of Salamanca\\" published the following day, 13 October 1936. According to Delgado, Portillo‚Äôs account of the speech became famous when a then very young British historian Hugh Thomas, aged 30, came across it in a Horizon anthology while researching his seminal book, The Spanish Civil War, and mistakenly took it as a primary source. In film The 2019 film While at War shows Unamuno (played by Karra Elejalde) between 18 July 1936 and his death. In the TV series Star Trek: Picard, the pilot Chris Rios has a book copy of The Tragic Sense of Life on the ship's dashboard.

Preikestolen is a steep cliff which rises above Lysefjorden. Atop the cliff, there is an almost flat top of approximately . Preikestolen is located near the Western part of the fjord, and on its North side. Tourism at the site has been increasing in the early 21st century, with between 150,000 and 200,000 visitors in 2012, making it one of the most visited natural tourist attractions in Norway. BASE jumpers often leap from the cliff. Due to its increased popularity, there is currently a project under way to improve the most used path to the site - a long hike. Name The old local name of the site is (). The name Prekestolen (without the i) was coined around the year 1900 when the local tourist organisation, wanted to promote the site for trekking. The \\"i\\" was added later to concord with Nynorsk, the official local form of Norwegian, and the site is now known both locally and officially as \\"Preikestolen.\\" Access Trail map and profile Preikestolen Preikestolen, June 2009 Preikestolen is located in the southern part of the Ryfylke district in Rogaland county in Western Norway. The city of Stavanger, the fourth largest in Norway, with a number of direct flights between European cities, is located from the site, and the parking facility for Preikestolen is located, thanks to April 2020 opening of Hundv√•g Tunnel, about 40 minutes from Stavanger by car. Access to Preikestolen from Stavanger is via the Norwegian National Road 13 (Rv13) and the ferry from Tau. From the south, access is by the Rv13 through Sandnes via the ferry from Lauvvika to Oanes. The road is usually open and the ferries running year- round. However, due to snow, it is not always possible to do the hike to the top in the winter. The road to the site ends in the municipality of Strand, just south of the town of J√∏rpeland at a parking facility at the Preikestolen Fjellstue, with a trail extending from the parking facility to the site. A round-trip hike to Preikestolen from the closest car park takes about 3‚Äì4 hours for someone of average fitness. The walk to Preikestolen is very steep in places. The path starts at the Preikestolhytta, at an elevation of approximately above sea level, and climbs to . The walk takes 2‚Äì3 hours depending on traffic along the trail, experience, and fitness level. Even though the elevation differential is only and the walk is not particularly long, about each way, the total elevation gain and loss over the course of the hike is more than one might initially expect, as the path climbs and descends various ridges. The walk is more difficult in winter and spring when there is snow and ice. Alternative access is available via a path from Bratteli - a stop for the tourist ferry from to Lysebotn that passes beneath the Pulpit Rock. This walk is more demanding, and takes 4‚Äì5 hours each way. An alternative is to sail through the Lysefjorden, with trips running year-round. Outside of summer, the weather may be wet and cold, and butts may obstruct views of the cliff. The ship stops at several small docks on the way in and out, including a layover at the end of the Lysefjorden at the village of Lysebotn. =Improvement project= In early April 2013, a project started to improve the path up to Preikestolen as the old one was so small that it often caused \\"delays\\", and at some points on the path it was sometimes impossible to get through. By August 2014, the path was completed. Access to the plateau was improved, and traffic on the way up and down is now much less delayed because of bottlenecks. =Safety= The authorities have opted not to install fencing or other safety devices as they felt it would detract from the site and the fact that fatalities at the site are extremely rare, despite having approximately 200,000 visitors each year. Furthermore, there were concerns that fences or other devices might encourage dangerous behavior such as climbing onto the fences. It is a policy from Norwegian authorities that \\"we cannot fence in all nature in this country\\". Up until 2013 there had been no accidental fatalities at the site. However, there were previously suicides and suicide attempts. In February 2000, an Austrian woman and a Norwegian man committed a joint suicide by jumping together off the cliff after meeting on the internet and forming a suicide pact. In October 2004, a young German couple were on their way to the cliff to commit suicide but were stopped by the Norwegian authorities before being able to carry out the act. In autumn 2013, a Spanish tourist became the first person to die from what was originally ruled to be an accident; however, right after the accident, a suicide note was posted on his Facebook account indicating that the incident was in fact a suicide . Nature =Geology= The cliff was formed during the ice age, approximately 10,000 years ago, when the edges of the glacier reached the cliff. The water from the glacier froze in the crevices of the mountain and eventually broke off large, angular blocks, which were later carried away with the glacier. This is the cause of the angular shape of the plateau. Along the plateau itself there continues to be a deep crack. Due to these cracks, the plateau will at some point fall down, but all the geological investigations have revealed that this will not happen in the foreseeable future, and geologists have confirmed the safety of the plateau. =Climate= Along the fjord there is a mild and humid coastal climate. =Surrounding landscape= The cliff overlooks the valleys of the Ryfylke region. The mountains surrounding the cliff reach heights of up to . Some of the hilltops have plains which are interspersed with lakes. Nearby, close to the end of the Lysefjord, is the tall mountain Kjerag which is also a hiking destination. Some tourists elect to forego trips to Preikestolen and go to Kjerag instead.

FLCL is a story following Naota Nandaba, an twelve-year-old boy whose suburban life is disturbed by the arrival of the mysterious Haruko Haruhara. The six-episode series was released in Japan from April 2000 to March 2001 alongside a manga and novel. It originally debuted in the United States on Adult Swim in August 2003, where it managed to gain a significant cult followinghttp://goboiano.com/everything-we-know-so-far-about-this-years- surprise-sequel-flcl-2/ and was widely acclaimed, despite its short length. The series would continue to air on the network in the following years, including runs on the network's Toonami programming block from October 2013 to January 2014, and in April 2018. The series is also available via iTunes, adultswim.com and Funimation's website. In 2016, two new seasons totaling 12 episodes were announced as a co-production between Production I.G, Toho, and Adult Swim. The second season, FLCL Progressive, premiered on June 2, 2018 on Adult Swim's Toonami block, while the third and final season, FLCL Alternative, premiered on September 8, 2018. In Japan, Alternative and Progressive had theatrical screenings with Alternative opening on September 7, 2018 and Progressive opening on September 28, 2018. The first episode of FLCL Alternative unexpectedly premiered on April Fool's Day 2018 at midnight on Toonami in Japanese with English subtitles. Plot The characters of FLCL's first season. The first season of FLCL is a coming-of-age story and revolves around Naota Nandaba, a 12-year-old, working-class boy living with his widowed father and grandfather. His life in the city of Mabase is interrupted by the arrival of a Vespa-riding maniac named Haruko Haruhara. She runs over Naota then revives him with CPR before hitting him on the head with her left-handed, electric bass guitar (a blue, vintage Rickenbacker 4001) and proceeds to stalk him.FLCL Ultimate edition liner notes Finding Haruko weaseling her way into his life as a live-in maid, Naota discovers that the head injury she caused created an \\"N.O.\\" portal, which giant robots produced by a company known as Medical Mechanica emerge from periodically. The first of these robots is hit on the head by Haruko and becomes a friendly service robot later named Canti. Canti ingests Naota to assume the reddened form he first had when fighting the robots sent after him. Haruko claims she is an alien investigator from the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood, and her presence places Naota and those around him in danger. The Interstellar Immigration Bureau's Commander Amarao, who Haruko has a history with, instead reveals she is an apathetic seductress seeking a space-manipulating being called Atomsk who was partially contained within Canti. Every time Naota is absorbed by Canti, Atomsk is gradually brought to Earth. As Atomsk is held in Medical Mechanica's custody and Haruko ultimately places Earth under threat, the company eventually turns their factory stationed on the planet into a doomsday terraforming device, attempting to have Naota and Canti absorbed by the doomsday device's Terminal Core. Haruko's plan fails as Naota ends up becoming Atomsk's host and then releases him into the universe after a brief battle that ends Medical Mechanica's attack on Earth. Haruko follows after Atomsk, and Mabase returns to some normalcy. In the second season, FLCL Progressive, Haruko returns to Mabase years later after a failed attempt to contain Atomsk, although she did manage to absorb him. Placing herself as a middle school homeroom teacher, Haruko targets a 14-year-old girl named Hidomi Hibajiri through her classmate and eventual love interest Ko Ide. Haruko finds opposition in both the headphones Hidomi wears and Julia Jinyu, a more stoic offshoot of Haruko that splintered from her during her initial attempt to control Atomsk's power. Haruko eventually eats Julia to restore herself, and uses Ide to get to Hidomi. Like before, this causes conflict between Medical Mechanica and the Interstellar Immigration Bureau, as the latter was reverse-engineering Canti's technology to utilize the N.O. Channel's energies for their own use. Atomsk appears on Earth as planned, but Haruko ends up failing again with a freed Julia taking her leave. Haruko regains her composure and resumes her hunt for Atomsk as Hidomi and Ide begin their relationship while Mabase rebuilds after much of it was destroyed by Medical Mechanica. In the final season, FLCL Alternative, Haruko enters the life of high school student Kana Koumoto and her friends as she became a mentor of sorts to Kana in helping the teen's transition into adulthood as Medical Mechanica begins its assault on Earth. Production The first season of FLCL was directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and produced by the FLCL Production Committee, which included Gainax, Production I.G, and Starchild Records. Tsurumaki has said that he tried to \\"break the rules\\" of anime when making FLCL, for example, by choosing a contemporary Japanese band to provide the soundtrack, and patterning the style more after \\"a Japanese TV commercial or promotional video\\", creating a work that is \\"short, but dense-packed\\". FLCLs localization director and script writer Marc Handler stated that localization of the script was the hardest part of the show. The in-jokes in the show included obscure pop culture references that had to be decoded and transferred to English audiences. One example was a reference to Cheerio, a discontinued soft drink in Japan, for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink at the time, Crystal Pepsi. Director Kazuya Tsurumaki responded to criticism of FLCL, stating \\"comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCL\\". The Medical Mechanica building featured is in the shape of a large iron. The character Amarao describes Medical Mechanica's goal as the destruction of all thought. FLCL uses the iron as a symbolic breakdown of \\"thought\\" by smoothing out the wrinkles as equated to the removing of the brain's wrinkles. For English localization, the Japanese team had to explain the concept because a direct translation of script did not convey the ideology. Release Six DVD compilations, each containing one episode, have been released in Japan by Gainax. In addition, a DVD collection box, containing all six DVD compilations, was released in Japan on August 13, 2005. Three DVD compilations were released by Synch-Point in North America. A DVD collection box, containing all the DVD compilations of the English episodes, was released on January 23, 2007, but have since gone out of print. In January 2010, Funimation announced that they had acquired the license for the series and would be releasing it on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in February 2011. Shortly after, it has been released in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment on a 3-disc DVD set and on Blu-ray Disc. It is also licensed in the United Kingdom by MVM Films. The series also aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block from August 4 to August 13, 2003. Media =Novels= A three-volume novel series was written by the anime's screenwriter, Yoji Enokido, illustrated by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Hiroyuki Imaishi, and published by Kadokawa Shoten. The novels were released in Japan in June 2000, October 2000, and March 2001 respectively. The English-language versions were published by Tokyopop and were released in North America on March 11, 2008; September 9, 2008; and March 10, 2009 respectively. The novels cover all 6 episodes of the anime, introducing elements that were not present in the original production. =Manga= A two-volume manga was created by artist Hajime Ueda. The manga interprets the series with certain elements altered and removed, and tells the events of the anime using a reductive art style and unsteady pacing. Jack Kotin defended the unique artstyle of the manga, saying \\"It can be crudely drawn at times, but this style fits in well with the overall story and atmosphere...\\". The manga was published by Kodansha and serialized in monthly Magazine Z. The two volumes were released on October 23, 2000 and August 23, 2001 respectively. The manga was re-released in bunkoban format with the two volumes labeled and in two individual box sets titled \\"Kodansha Box\\". J≈ç volume was on May 7, 2007 and the Ge volume was released on June 4, 2007. An edited tank≈çbon version of the manga that was released in box sets, were released on January 10, 2012 and February 9, 2012 respectively. The English-language editions of the manga was released by Tokyopop on September 16, 2003 and on November 4, 2003 respectively. In March 2011, Dark Horse Comics announced to re-release the manga in omnibus edition. The omnibus edition was released on May 16, 2012 and includes remastered story pages, a remastered script, and bonus color pages. =Soundtracks= Six pieces of theme music are used for the episodes; five opening themes and one closing theme, all by Japanese rock band The Pillows. The battle themes are \\"Advice\\", \\"Little Busters\\" and \\"I Think I Can\\"; the opening themes are: \\"One Life\\", used in episode one, \\"Instant Music\\" in episodes two and three, \\"Happy Bivouac\\" in episode four, \\"Runners High\\", in episode five, and \\"Carnival\\" in episode six. The closing theme of each episode is \\"Ride on Shooting Star\\". Geneon Entertainment has released three original soundtracks encompassing the songs by The Pillows, and the score by composer Shinkichi Mitsumune. The first soundtrack, titled , contains tracks featured in the first three episodes of FLCL. The soundtrack was released on October 4, 2000 in Japan and January 20, 2004 in the US. The second soundtrack, titled , contains tracks featured in the last three episodes of FLCL. The soundtrack was released on July 25, 2001 Japan and September 7, 2004 in the US. This volume features several audio dramas, with the cast of FLCL playing the various parts. Due to the dramas included, this album acts as a sequel of sorts to the anime. The third soundtrack, titled , is a compilation of the first two soundtracks, featuring only music by The Pillows. The released on June 8, 2005 and June 7, 2005 in the US. Unlike the previous two soundtracks, the songs are the original vocal versions from the band's LPs. A fourth album title was released in September 2018 with music used in Progressive and Alternative. Reception A Vespa scooter, as used by Haruko. FLCL has received a mostly positive reception. The series has been described as \\"bizarre\\" and \\"surreal\\", and has been noted for its symbolic content, unusual plot, and its soundtrack composed by The Pillows. Its experimental nature has also been noted, which includes an entire scene made in the cutout animation style of animated American series South Park,https://www.theodysseyonline.com/flclhttp://www.southparkwillie.com/SPinfo/SPrefs.htm or The Matrix-like camera rotation tricks. Christopher McDonald of Anime News Network called it \\"downright hilarious\\" and \\"visually superb\\" with great music, citing the packaging of 2 episodes per DVD as the only weakness of Synch-Point's original release. Robert Nelson of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars, stating \\"FLCL may not have a straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But FLCL does succeed in its true objective. It is fun to watch!\\" Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A‚àí, stating \\"FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor and you end up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life.\\" Brian Ruh praised the series, stating \\"It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animation.\\" IGN columnist Davis Smith reviewed the anime shortly after its English premiere, in the article Smith praised the series' unusual story telling, extremely high quality animation and the soundtrack provided by The Pillows; rewarding the series a score of 9 out of 10 concluding, \\"Logic dictates that FLCL should be an undisciplined and unaffecting mess, given all the insanity that its creators are attempting to weld into a functioning whole. Yet while it's hard to explain exactly why, it works. It entertains me. At times, it makes me laugh; at times, it makes me a little misty-eyed; at times, it makes me want to scream and howl and light things on fire and break windows with baseball bats and yes, maybe even buy a Vespa. That's the kind of success that you just can't argue with.\\" From January 3 to February 7, 2012, Hayden Childs, of the online magazine The A.V. Club, composed a six-part weekly analysis and review of each FLCL episode in celebration of The Legend of Korra's then upcoming third season, a series that was heavily influenced by FLCL's animation style. In the article, Childs gave an extremely positive review of the series, understanding it as a surrealist inspired coming of age story, stating \\"For all of its wild and initially bewildering aspects, the major purpose of FLCL is the impressionistic and often naturalistic documentation of Naota's passage into maturity.\\" Avatar: The Last Airbender director Giancarlo Volpe has stated members of his staff \\"were all ordered to buy FLCL and watch every single episode of it.\\" =Awards and acclaims= On August 12, 2003, a Time Warner press release noted the success of Cartoon Network: FLCL \\"ranked No. 42 among all shows on ad-supported cable among adults 18‚Äì34\\". Also in 2003, FLCL won third place for Best Animation Film at the Fantasia Festival. On February 24, 2007, FLCL was nominated for \\"Best Cast\\", and won \\"Best Comedy Series\\" and \\"Best Short Series\\" at the first American Anime Awards show. Anime Insider ranked FLCL 4th in their list of the best English-licensed anime of all time in November 2007. Sequel series Anime News Network reported on August 31, 2015 that the production studio Production I.G may have been planning a remake of the popular series after announcing their purchase of the rights to FLCL from production company Gainax. This led many to speculate on the potential of a remake or possible continuation of the series. According to Hideaki Anno, Anno's studio Khara was originally set to buy the rights to FLCL from Gainax. Before the deal was done however, Gainax suddenly raised the asking price causing the deal to fall though.https://twitter.com/khara_inc/status/1211398615261798400 On March 24, 2016 via Toonami's official Facebook and Tumblr pages it was announced that 12 new episodes of FLCL would be produced in cooperation with Production I.G. The episodes were split into two individual seasons: and which served as sequels to the popular series which were initially broadcast on Adult Swim in August 2003. Neon Genesis Evangelion character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto designed the characters and Kazuya Tsurumaki, an assistant director on Neon Genesis Evangelion, served as director. The synopsis of the series was published by Adult Swim: FLCL Progressive, the sequel series, featured the return of original character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamato (as his respective role) and original series creator Kazuya Tsurumaki, who supervised the project. Hideto Iwai wrote the scripts, and Katsuyuki Motohiro served as chief director on the project, with each episode featuring a different director: Kazuto Arai, Toshihisa Kaiya, Yuki Ogawa, Yoshihide Ibata, Kei Suezawa, and Hiroshi Ikehata. The animation was produced mostly by Production I.G, but studios Signal.MD and Production GoodBook handled episodes 2 and 5, respectively. The Pillows contributed to the series soundtrack, although the score was primarily composed by R„ÉªO„ÉªN from music production company VERYGOO. FLCL Alternative, the third and final series, once again saw the return of character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, composer R„ÉªO„ÉªN (with tracks by The Pillows), scriptwriter Hideto Iwai, and supervisor Kazuya Tsurukamki. Katsuyuki Motohiro, as well, returned as chief director, although Yutaka Uemara was the only director, and Kiyotaka Suzuki served as assistant director. Production I.G, REVOROOT, and NUT produced the animation for the series. FLCL Progressive premiered on June 2, 2018 on Adult Swim's Toonami block; FLCL Alternative premiered on September 8, 2018 and concluded on October 13, 2018. In Japan, Alternative and Progressive had theatrical screenings on September 7, 2018, and September 28, 2018, respectively. The first episode of FLCL Alternative unexpectedly premiered early at midnight on April Fool's Day on Toonami, airing entirely in Japanese with English subtitles. The day of the second season's US premiere, Toonami simultaneously announced via its Facebook page that they would be delaying the English subtitled versions of both new seasons until November 2018, in respect for the Japanese film format releases.

The green line represents an overfitted model and the black line represents a regularized model. While the green line best follows the training data, it is too dependent on that data and it is likely to have a higher error rate on new unseen data, compared to the black line. Figure 2. Noisy (roughly linear) data is fitted to a linear function and a polynomial function. Although the polynomial function is a perfect fit, the linear function can be expected to generalize better: if the two functions were used to extrapolate beyond the fitted data, the linear function should make better predictions. Figure 3. The blue dashed line represents an underfitted model. A straight line can never fit a parabola. This model is too simple. In statistics, overfitting is \\"the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably\\".Definition of \\"overfitting\\" at OxfordDictionaries.com: this definition is specifically for statistics. An overfitted model is a statistical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation (i.e. the noise) as if that variation represented underlying model structure. In other words, the model remembers a huge number of examples instead of learning to notice features. Underfitting occurs when a statistical model cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. An under-fitted model is a model where some parameters or terms that would appear in a correctly specified model are missing. Under- fitting would occur, for example, when fitting a linear model to non-linear data. Such a model will tend to have poor predictive performance. Over-fitting and under-fitting can occur in machine learning, in particular. In machine learning, the phenomena are sometimes called \\"over-training\\" and \\"under- training\\". The possibility of over-fitting exists because the criterion used for selecting the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the suitability of a model. For example, a model might be selected by maximizing its performance on some set of training data, and yet its suitability might be determined by its ability to perform well on unseen data; then over-fitting occurs when a model begins to \\"memorize\\" training data rather than \\"learning\\" to generalize from a trend. As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations, then a model can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the data in its entirety. (For an illustration, see Figure 2.) Such a model, though, will typically fail severely when making predictions. The potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data shape, and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level of noise or error in the data. Even when the fitted model does not have an excessive number of parameters, it is to be expected that the fitted relationship will appear to perform less well on a new data set than on the data set used for fitting (a phenomenon sometimes known as shrinkage).Everitt B.S., Skrondal A. (2010), Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, Cambridge University Press. In particular, the value of the coefficient of determination will shrink relative to the original data. To lessen the chance of, or amount of, overfitting, several techniques are available (e.g. model comparison, cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, pruning, Bayesian priors, or dropout). The basis of some techniques is either (1) to explicitly penalize overly complex models or (2) to test the model's ability to generalize by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for training, which is assumed to approximate the typical unseen data that a model will encounter. Statistical inference In statistics, an inference is drawn from a statistical model, which has been selected via some procedure. Burnham & Anderson, in their much-cited text on model selection, argue that to avoid overfitting, we should adhere to the \\"Principle of Parsimony\\".. The authors also state the following. Overfitting is more likely to be a serious concern when there is little theory available to guide the analysis, in part because then there tend to be a large number of models to select from. The book Model Selection and Model Averaging (2008) puts it this way.. =Regression= In regression analysis, overfitting occurs frequently.. As an extreme example, if there are p variables in a linear regression with p data points, the fitted line can go exactly through every point. For logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models, there are a variety of rules of thumb (e.g. 5‚Äì9, 10 and 10‚Äì15 ‚Äî the guideline of 10 observations per independent variable is known as the \\"one in ten rule\\"). In the process of regression model selection, the mean squared error of the random regression function can be split into random noise, approximation bias, and variance in the estimate of the regression function. The bias‚Äìvariance tradeoff is often used to overcome overfit models. With a large set of explanatory variables that actually have no relation to the dependent variable being predicted, some variables will in general be falsely found to be statistically significant and the researcher may thus retain them in the model, thereby overfitting the model. This is known as Freedman's paradox. Machine learning Figure 4. Overfitting/overtraining in supervised learning (e.g., neural network). Training error is shown in blue, validation error in red, both as a function of the number of training cycles. If the validation error increases(positive slope) while the training error steadily decreases(negative slope) then a situation of overfitting may have occurred. The best predictive and fitted model would be where the validation error has its global minimum. Usually a learning algorithm is trained using some set of \\"training data\\": exemplary situations for which the desired output is known. The goal is that the algorithm will also perform well on predicting the output when fed \\"validation data\\" that was not encountered during its training. Overfitting is the use of models or procedures that violate Occam's razor, for example by including more adjustable parameters than are ultimately optimal, or by using a more complicated approach than is ultimately optimal. For an example where there are too many adjustable parameters, consider a dataset where training data for can be adequately predicted by a linear function of two independent variables. Such a function requires only three parameters (the intercept and two slopes). Replacing this simple function with a new, more complex quadratic function, or with a new, more complex linear function on more than two independent variables, carries a risk: Occam's razor implies that any given complex function is a priori less probable than any given simple function. If the new, more complicated function is selected instead of the simple function, and if there was not a large enough gain in training-data fit to offset the complexity increase, then the new complex function \\"overfits\\" the data, and the complex overfitted function will likely perform worse than the simpler function on validation data outside the training dataset, even though the complex function performed as well, or perhaps even better, on the training dataset. When comparing different types of models, complexity cannot be measured solely by counting how many parameters exist in each model; the expressivity of each parameter must be considered as well. For example, it is nontrivial to directly compare the complexity of a neural net (which can track curvilinear relationships) with parameters to a regression model with parameters. Overfitting is especially likely in cases where learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, causing the learner to adjust to very specific random features of the training data that have no causal relation to the target function. In this process of overfitting, the performance on the training examples still increases while the performance on unseen data becomes worse. As a simple example, consider a database of retail purchases that includes the item bought, the purchaser, and the date and time of purchase. It's easy to construct a model that will fit the training set perfectly by using the date and time of purchase to predict the other attributes, but this model will not generalize at all to new data, because those past times will never occur again. Generally, a learning algorithm is said to overfit relative to a simpler one if it is more accurate in fitting known data (hindsight) but less accurate in predicting new data (foresight). One can intuitively understand overfitting from the fact that information from all past experience can be divided into two groups: information that is relevant for the future, and irrelevant information (\\"noise\\"). Everything else being equal, the more difficult a criterion is to predict (i.e., the higher its uncertainty), the more noise exists in past information that needs to be ignored. The problem is determining which part to ignore. A learning algorithm that can reduce the chance of fitting noise is called \\"robust.\\" =Consequences= The most obvious consequence of overfitting is poor performance on the validation dataset. Other negative consequences include: * A function that is overfitted is likely to request more information about each item in the validation dataset than does the optimal function; gathering this additional unneeded data can be expensive or error-prone, especially if each individual piece of information must be gathered by human observation and manual data-entry. * A more complex, overfitted function is likely to be less portable than a simple one. At one extreme, a one-variable linear regression is so portable that, if necessary, it could even be done by hand. At the other extreme are models that can be reproduced only by exactly duplicating the original modeler's entire setup, making reuse or scientific reproduction difficult. =Remedy= The optimal function usually needs verification on bigger or completely new datasets. There are, however, methods like minimum spanning tree or life-time of correlation that applies the dependence between correlation coefficients and time-series (window width). Whenever the window width is big enough, the correlation coefficients are stable and don't depend on the window width size anymore. Therefore, a correlation matrix can be created by calculating a coefficient of correlation between investigated variables. This matrix can be represented topologically as a complex network where direct and indirect influences between variables are visualized. Underfitting Underfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. It occurs when the model or algorithm does not fit the data enough. Underfitting occurs if the model or algorithm shows low variance but high bias (to contrast the opposite, overfitting from high variance and low bias). It is often a result of an excessively simple model. Burnham & Anderson state the following.

He was admiral of the fleet and Chief of Staff of the French Navy in 1939 at the beginning of World War II. After France signed an armistice with Nazi Germany in 1940, Darlan served in the pro-German Vichy regime, becoming its deputy leader for a time. When the Allies invaded French North Africa in 1942, Darlan was the highest-ranking officer there, and a deal was made, giving him control of North African French forces in exchange for joining their side. Less than two months later he was assassinated. Early life and early career Darlan was born in N√©rac, Lot- et-Garonne, to a family with a long connection with the French Navy. His great-grandfather was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar. His father, Jean- Baptiste Darlan, was a lawyer and politician who served as Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Jules M√©line. Georges Leygues, a political colleague of his father who would spend seven years as Minister of the Marine, was Darlan's godfather. Darlan graduated from the √âcole Navale in 1902. During World War I, he commanded an artillery battery that took part in the Battle of Verdun. After the war Darlan commanded the training ships Jeanne d'Arc and Edgar Quinet, receiving promotions to frigate captain in 1920 and captain in 1926. Thereafter Darlan rose swiftly. He was appointed Chef de Cabinet to Leygues and promoted to contre-amiral in 1929. In 1930, he served as the French Navy's representative at the London Naval Conference, and in 1932 he was promoted to vice-amiral. Subsequently, in 1934, he took command of the Atlantic Squadron at Brest. He was promoted to vice-amiral d'escadre in 1936. He was appointed Chief of the Naval Staff from 1 January 1937, at the same time promoted to amiral. As head of the Navy he successfully used his political connections to lobby for a building program to counter the rising threat from the Kriegsmarine and Regia Marina. After attending the Coronation of George VI, Darlan complained that protocol had left him, as a mere vice admiral, \\"behind a pillar and after the Chinese admiral\\".Auphan and Mordai, p. 17 In 1939 he was promoted to Amiral de la flotte, a rank created specifically to put him on equal terms with the First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy. After the declaration of war in September 1939, Darlan became Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy. Vichy government =Armistice= Darlan was immensely proud of the French navy which he had helped to build up, and after Axis forces defeated France (May‚ÄìJune 1940), on 3 June he threatened that he would mutiny and lead the fleet to fight under the British flag in the event of an armistice.Lacouture 1991, p. 231 Darlan promised Churchill at the Briare Conference (12 June) that no French ship would ever come into German hands. Even on 15 June he was still talking of a potential armistice with indignation.Lacouture 1991, p.231 Darlan appears to have retreated from his position on 15 June, when the Cabinet voted 13‚Äì6 for Camille Chautemps' compromise proposal to inquire about possible terms. He was willing to accept an armistice provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands.Williams 2005, pp. 325‚Äì27 On 16 June Churchill's telegram arrived agreeing to an armistice (France and Britain were bound by treaty not to seek a separate peace) provided the French fleet was moved to British ports. This was not acceptable to Darlan, who argued that it would leave France defenceless.Atkin 1997, pp. 82‚Äì86 That day, according to Jules Moch, he declared that Britain was finished so there was no point in continuing to fight, and he was concerned that if there was no armistice Hitler would invade French North Africa via Franco's Spain. That evening Paul Reynaud, feeling he lacked sufficient cabinet support for continuing the war, resigned as Prime Minister, and Philippe P√©tain formed a new government with a view to seeking an armistice with Germany. Darlan served as the Minister of Marine in the P√©tain administration from 16 June. On 18 June Darlan gave his \\"word of honour\\" to the British First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound that he would not allow the French fleet to fall into German hands.Lacouture 1991, p. 246 Petain's government signed an armistice (22 June 1940) but retained control of the territories known as \\"Vichy France\\" after the capital moved to Vichy in early July. General Charles Nogu√®s, Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa, was dismayed at the armistice but accepted it partly (he claimed) because Darlan would not let him have the French fleet to continue hostilities against the Axis powers.Lacouture 1991, pp. 229‚Äì30 Churchill later wrote that Darlan could have been the leader of the Free French, \\"a de Gaulle raised to the tenth power\\", had he defected at this time. De Gaulle's biographer Jean Lacouture described Darlan as \\"the archetypal man of failed destiny\\" thereafter. =Darlan, the French Navy and the British= The terms of the armistice called for the demobilisation and disarmament of the ships of the French Navy under German supervision in their home ports (mostly in the German-occupied zone). As the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill pointed out, this meant that French warships would be fully armed when they came under German control. At Italian suggestion, the armistice terms were amended to permit the fleet to stay temporarily in North African ports, where they might potentially be seized by Italian troops from Libya. Darlan ordered all ships then in the Atlantic ports (which Germany would soon occupy) to steam to French overseas possessions, out of reach of the Germans, although not necessarily of the Italians. Despite Darlan's assurance, Churchill had remained concerned that Darlan might be overruled by the politicians, and this concern was not allayed by Darlan becoming a government minister himself. Darlan repeatedly refused British requests to place the whole fleet in British custody (or in the French West Indies), and in attempts to get the British to release French warships, gave a version of the armistice terms inconsistent with what the British knew from other sources to be the case. They lacked confidence that Darlan was being straight with them (one government adviser minuted that he had 'turned crook like the rest') and believed that, even if he was sincere, he could not deliver on his promise. This belief led to Operation Catapult, where, on 3 July 1940 British forces destroyed French ships anchored at Mers-el-K√©bir. The plans for \\"Catapult\\" had been drawn up as early as 14, 15 or 16 June. Darlan was at his house at N√©rac in Gascony on 3 July, and could not be contacted.Lacouture 1991, p. 247 Thereafter, French forces loyal to Vichy (most of them under Darlan's command) fiercely resisted British moves into French territory, and sometimes co-operated with German forces. However, as Darlan had promised, no capital ships fell into German hands, and only three destroyers and a few dozen submarines and smaller vessels passed into German control. Darlan expected Germany to win the war and saw it as to France's advantage to collaborate with Germany. He distrusted the British, and after the armistice of June 1940, he seriously considered waging a naval war against Britain. =1941‚Äì42: collaboration with Germany and after= P√©tain and G√∂ring in France, 1941 Darlan came from a republican background and never believed in the Vichyite R√©volution nationale; for example, he had reservations about P√©tain's clericalism. However, by 1941 Darlan had become P√©tain's most trusted associate. In February 1941 Darlan replaced Pierre-√âtienne Flandin as \\"Vice President of the Council\\" (prime minister). He also became Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of National Defence, making him the de facto head of the Vichy government. On 11 February he was named P√©tain's eventual successor, in accordance with Act Number Four of the constitution. As a prominent figure in the Vichy government, Darlan repeatedly offered Hitler active military cooperation against Britain. Hitler, however, distrusted France and wanted it to remain neutral during his planned attack on the Soviet Union. Darlan negotiated the Paris Protocols of May 1941 with Germany, in which Germany made concessions on prisoners of war and occupation terms, and France agreed to German bases in French colonies. This last condition was opposed by Darlan's rival, General Maxime Weygand, and the Protocols were never ratified, though Weygand was dismissed at German insistence in November 1941. However, the Germans became suspicious of Darlan's opportunism and malleable loyalties as his obstructionism mounted. He refused to provide French conscript labour, he also insisted on protecting Jewish war veterans, and only reluctantly enforced anti-Semitic laws. After the British conquered French Syria and Lebanon in June‚ÄìJuly 1941, and the German invasion of the USSR stalled before Moscow by December 1941, Darlan moved away from his policy of collaboration. Because he reported only to P√©tain, Darlan exercised broad powers, although P√©tain's own entourage (incluing Weygand) continued to wield considerable influence. In running the French colonial empire, Darlan relied heavily on the personal loyalty of key army and naval officers in the colonies to head off defection to Free France. In January 1942, Darlan assumed additional government offices. But in April 1942, at German insistence, Darlan resigned his ministries, and was replaced by Laval, whom the Germans considered more trustworthy. Darlan retained several lesser posts, including that of commander-in-chief of the French armed forces. Darlan's deal in North Africa On 7 November 1942, Darlan went to Algiers to visit his son, who was hospitalised. The next day, 8 November, the Western Allies would invade French North Africa. During the night of 7‚Äì8 November, forces of a pro-Allied group in Algeria (not connected with Free France) seized control of Algiers in anticipation of the invasion. In the process, they captured Darlan. The Allies had anticipated little resistance from French forces in North Africa, instead expecting them to accept the authority of General Henri Giraud, who was extracted from France to take charge. But resistance continued, and no one heeded Giraud, who had no official status. To bring a quick end to the resistance and secure French co- operation, the Allies came to an agreement with Darlan, who as commander-in- chief could give the necessary orders. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander on the spot recognized Darlan as commander of all French forces in the area and recognized his self-nomination as High Commissioner of France (head of civil government) for North and West Africa on 14 November. In return, on 10 November, Darlan ordered all French forces to join the Allies. His order was obeyed; not only in French North Africa, but also by the Vichy forces in French West Africa with its potentially useful facilities at Dakar. The \\"Darlan deal\\" proved highly controversial, as Darlan had been a notorious collaborator with Germany. General de Gaulle and his Free France organization were outraged; so were the pro-Allied conspirators who had seized Algiers. Some high American and British officials objected, and there was furious criticism by newspapers and politicians. Roosevelt defended it (using wording suggested by Churchill) as 'a temporary expedient, justified only by the stress of battle'. Churchill persuaded an initially sceptical secret session of the House of Commons, saying that Eisenhower's recognition of Darlan was right, and even if it was not quite right, it had meant French rifles being pointed not at the Allies, but at the Axis: \\"I am sorry to have to mention a point like this, but it makes a lot of difference to a soldier whether a man fires his gun at him, or at an enemy...\\" Later, American historian Arthur Funk maintained that the \\"deal with Darlan\\" was misunderstood by the critics at the time as an opportunistic improvisation. Funk claimed Darlan had been in talks with American diplomats for months about switching sides, and when the opportunity came he did so promptly. The \\"deal\\" thus was the result of a long and carefully considered Allied plan for reaching a political and military accord with Vichy. It followed a model drawn up in London and already approved at the highest levels. The \\"deal\\" was even more upsetting to Berlin and to the Vichy government. P√©tain stripped Darlan of his offices and ordered resistance to the end in North Africa, but was ignored. The Germans were more direct: German troops occupied the remaining 40% of France. However, the Germans paused outside Toulon, the base where most of the remaining French ships were moored. Only on 27 November did the Germans try to seize the ships, but all capital ships were scuttled, and only three destroyers and a few dozen smaller ships were captured, mostly fulfilling Darlan's promise in 1940 to Churchill. Assassination On the afternoon of 24 December 1942, Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle shot Darlan in his headquarters; Darlan died a few hours later. Bonnier de La Chapelle was a youth of 20, the son of a French journalist. He was a monarchist, and opposed to Vichy. He was involved with a royalist group that wanted to restore the pretender to the French throne, the Count of Paris. Bonnier de La Chapelle was arrested immediately, tried and convicted the next day, and executed by firing squad on 26 December. Legacy Darlan was unpopular with the Allies ‚Äì he was considered pompous, having asked Eisenhower to provide 200 Coldstream Guards and Grenadier Guards as an honor company for the commemoration of Napoleon's victory at Austerlitz. It was said that \\"no tears were shed\\" by the British over his death. Harold Macmillan, who was Churchill's adviser to Eisenhower at the time of the assassination, wryly described Darlan's service and death by saying, \\"Once bought, he stayed bought.\\" References Further reading *Atkin, Nicholas, P√©tain, Longman, 1997, * Funk, Arthur L. \\"Negotiating the 'Deal with Darlan'.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 8.2 (1973): 81‚Äì117. online * Funk, Arthur L.

Laboratory services are provided in a variety of settings: physicians offices, clinics, hospitals, and regional and national referral centers.Laboratory Structure and Function Overview Laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering. A physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber, while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength. A chemist or biologist might use a wet laboratory, while a psychologist's laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by computer scientists, computers (sometimes supercomputers) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data. Scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories. Engineers use laboratories as well to design, build, and test technological devices. Scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and universities, industry, government, or military facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft. Laboratory, Brecon County School for Girls Despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts, the term \\"laboratory\\" is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as Living Labs, Fab Labs, or Hackerspaces, in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes, working collaboratively or sharing resources. This development is inspired by new, participatory approaches to science and innovation and relies on user-centred design methodsISO 13407:(1999), titled Human-centred design processes for interactive systems, is an ISO Standard providing Guidance on human-centred design activities throughout the life cycle of interactive computer-based systems. and concepts like Open innovation or User innovation,.Von Hippel, E.

History Early instances of \\"laboratories\\" recorded in English involved alchemy and the preparation of medicines. : \\"Originally: a room or building for the practice of alchemy and the preparation of medicines. Later: one equipped for carrying out scientific experiments or procedures, esp. for the purposes of research, teaching, or analysis; (also) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured.\\" The emergence of Big Science during World War II increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment, introducing particle accelerators and similar devices. = The early laboratories = The earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of Pythagoras of Samos, the well-known Greek philosopher and scientist. This laboratory was created when Pythagoras conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string. In the painting of Louis Pasteur by Albert Edelfelt in 1885, Louis Pasteur is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand, and not wearing any personal protective equipment. Researching in teams started in the 19th century, and many new kinds of equipment were developed in the 20th century. A 16th century underground alchemical laboratory was accidentally discovered in the year 2002. Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor was believed to be the owner. The laboratory is called Speculum Alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in Prague. File:Chemielabor des 18.

Equipment and supplies beakers, an Erlenmeyer flask, a graduated cylinder and a volumetric flask Laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory: The classical equipment includes tools such as Bunsen burners and microscopes as well as specialty equipment such as operant conditioning chambers, spectrophotometers and calorimeters. ;Chemical laboratories * laboratory glassware such as the beaker or reagent bottle * Analytical devices as HPLC or spectrophotometers ;Molecular biology laboratories + Life science laboratories * Autoclave * Microscope * Centrifuges * Shakers & mixers * Pipette * Thermal cyclers (PCR) * Photometer * Refrigerators and Freezers * Universal testing machine * ULT Freezers * Incubators * Bioreactor * Biological safety cabinets * Sequencing instruments * Fume hoods * Environmental chamber * Humidifier * Weighing scale * Reagents (supply) * Pipettes tips (supply) * Polymer (supply) consumables for small volumes (¬µL and mL scale), mainly sterile Laboratory equipment is generally used to either perform an experiment or to take measurements and gather data.

Specialized types The title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories. These notably include: * Film laboratory or Darkroom * Clandestine lab for the production of illegal drugs * Computer lab * Crime lab used to process crime scene evidence * Language laboratory * Medical laboratory (involves handling of chemical compounds) * Public health laboratory * Industrial laboratory Safety An eyewash station in a laboratory. Geneticist 246x246px In many laboratories, hazards are present. Laboratory hazards might include poisons; infectious agents; flammable, explosive, or radioactive materials; moving machinery; extreme temperatures; lasers, strong magnetic fields or high voltage. Therefore, safety precautions are vitally important. Rules exist to minimize the individual's risk, and safety equipment is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace, has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories. This standard is often referred to as the \\"Laboratory Standard\\". Under this standard, a laboratory is required to produce a Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location, and its approach to them. In determining the proper Chemical Hygiene Plan for a particular business or laboratory, it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard, evaluation of the current safety, health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards. The CHP must be reviewed annually. Many schools and businesses employ safety, health, and environmental specialists, such as a Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) to develop, manage, and evaluate their CHP. Additionally, third party review is also used to provide an objective \\"outside view\\" which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit. Inspections and audits like also be conducted on a regular basis to assess hazards due to chemical handling and storage, electrical equipment, biohazards, hazardous waste management, chemical waste, housekeeping and emergency preparedness, radiation safety, ventilation as well as respiratory testing and indoor air quality. An important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to or work in the laboratory. Training is critical to the ongoing safe operation of the laboratory facility. Educators, staff and management must be engaged in working to reduce the likelihood of accidents, injuries and potential litigation. Efforts are made to ensure laboratory safety videos are both relevant and engaging. Organization Organization of laboratories is an area of focus in sociology. Scientists consider how their work should be organized, which could be based on themes, teams, projects or fields of expertise. Work is divided, not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers, engineers and technicians, but also in terms of autonomy (should the work be individual or in groups). For example, one research group has a schedule where they conduct research on their own topic of interest for one day of the week, but for the rest they work on a given group project. Finance management is yet another organizational issue. The laboratory itself is a historically dated organizational model. It came about due to the observation that the quality of work of researchers who collaborate is overall greater than a researcher working in isolation. From the 1950s, the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research, into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity. Some forms of organization in laboratories include: *Their size: Varies from a handful of researches to several hundred. *The division of labor: \\"Occurs between designers and operatives; researchers, engineers, and technicians; theoreticians and experimenters; senior researchers, junior researchers and students; those who publish, those who sign the publications and the others; and between specialities.\\" The sociology of scientific work p98 *The coordination mechanisms: Which includes the formalization of objectives and tasks; the standardization of procedures (protocols, project management, quality management, knowledge management), the validation of publications and cross- cutting activities (number and type of seminars). There are three main factors that contribute to the organizational form of a laboratory : * The educational background of the researchers and their socialization process. * The intellectual process involved in their work, including the type of investigation and equipment they use. * The laboratory's history. Other forms of organization include social organization. = Social organization = A study by Richard H.R. Harper, involving two laboratories, will help elucidate the concept of social organization in laboratories. The main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory (researchers, administrators, receptionists, technicians, etc.) and their Locator. A Locator is an employee of a Laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is, based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member. The study describes social relationships among different classes of jobs, such as the relationship between researchers and the Locator. It does not describe the social relationship between employees within a class, such as the relationship between researchers. Through ethnographic studies, one finding is that, among the personnel, each class (researchers, administrators...) has a different degree of entitlement, which varies per laboratory. Entitlement can be both formal or informal (meaning it's not enforced), but each class is aware and conforms to its existence. The degree of entitlement, which is also referred to as a staff's rights, affects social interaction between staff. By looking at the various interactions among staff members, we can determine their social position in the organization. As an example, administrators, in one lab of the study, do not have the right to ask the Locator where the researchers currently are, as they are not entitled to such information. On the other hand, researchers do have access to this type of information. So a consequence of this social hierarchy is that the Locator discloses various degrees of information, based on the staff member and their rights. The Locator does not want to disclose information that could jeopardize his relationship with the members of staff. The Locator adheres to the rights of each class. Social hierarchy is also related to attitudes towards technologies. This was inferred based on the attitude of various jobs towards their lab badge. Their attitude depended on how that job viewed their badge from a standpoint of utility, (how is the badge useful for my job) morality (what are my morals on privacy, as it relates to being tracked by this badge) and relations (how will I be seen by others if I refuse to wear this badge). For example, a receptionist would view the badge as useful, as it would help them locate members of staff during the day. Illustrating relations, researchers would also wear their badge due to informal pressures, such as not wanting to look like a spoil-sport, or not wanting to draw attention to themselves. Another finding is the resistance to change in a social organization. Staff members feel ill at ease when changing patterns of entitlement, obligation, respect, informal and formal hierarchy, and more. In summary, differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization: A person's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization. This hierarchy helps understand information distribution, control, and attitudes towards technologies in the laboratory.

He is best known for his work on the programming language Lisp, his former startup Viaweb (later renamed Yahoo! Store), cofounding the influential startup accelerator and seed capital firm Y Combinator, his blog, and Hacker News. He is the author of several computer programming books, including: On Lisp (1993), ANSI Common Lisp (1995), and Hackers & Painters (2004). Technology journalist Steven Levy has described Graham as a \\"hacker philosopher\\". Biography =Early life= Graham and his family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1968, where he later attended Gateway High School. Graham gained interest in science and mathematics from his father who was a nuclear physicist. =Education= Graham received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Cornell UniversityUndergraduation. Paul Graham. Retrieved 22 July 2011. (1986).EZRA: Cornell's Quarterly Magazine (Fall 2011) \\"Paul Graham '86\\" He then attended Harvard University, earning Master of Science (1988) and Doctor of Philosophy (1990) degrees in computer science. He has also studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. =Career= In 1996, Graham and Robert Morris founded Viaweb and recruited Trevor Blackwell shortly after. Viaweb was the first application service provider (ASP) according to Graham. Viaweb's software, written mostly in Common Lisp, allowed users to make their own Internet stores. In the summer of 1998, Viaweb was sold to Yahoo! for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock, valued at $49.6 million. After the acquisition, the product became Yahoo! Store. Graham later gained notice for his essays, which he posts to his personal website. Essay subjects range from \\"Beating the Averages\\", which compares Lisp to other programming languages and introduced the hypothetical programming language Blub, to \\"Why Nerds are Unpopular\\", a discussion of nerd life in high school. A collection of his essays has been published as Hackers & Painters by O'Reilly Media, which includes a discussion of the growth of Viaweb and what Graham perceives to be the advantages of Lisp to program it. In 2001, Graham announced that he was working on a new dialect of Lisp named Arc. It was released on 29 January 2008. Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, most notably the Hacker News web forum and news aggregator program. In October 2019, Graham announced a specification for another new dialect of Lisp, written in itself, named Bel. In 2005, after giving a talk at the Harvard Computer Society later published as \\"How to Start a Startup\\", Graham along with Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris started Y Combinator to provide seed funding to a large number of startups, particularly those started by younger, more technically oriented founders. Y Combinator has now invested in more than 1300 startups, including Reddit, Justin.tv, Xobni, Dropbox, Airbnb and Stripe. BusinessWeek included Paul Graham in 2008 edition of its annual feature, The 25 Most Influential People on the Web. In response to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), Graham announced in late 2011 that no representatives of any company supporting it would be invited to Y Combinator's Demo Day events. In February 2014, Graham stepped down from his day-to-day role at Y Combinator. =Personal life= In 2008, Paul Graham married Jessica Livingston. Graham currently has two children and resides in England.https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1250041502270717952 Essays = Graham's hierarchy of disagreement= Graham's hierarchy of disagreement Graham proposed a \\"disagreement hierarchy\\" in a 2008 essay \\"How to Disagree\\", putting types of argument into a seven-point hierarchy and observing that \\"If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean, that will make most of them happier.\\" Graham also suggested that the hierarchy can be thought of as a pyramid, as the highest forms of disagreement are rarer. Following this hierarchy, Graham notes that articulate forms of name-calling (e.g., \\"The author is a self-important dilettante\\") are no different from crude insults. = The Blub paradox= Graham considers the hierarchy of programming languages with the example of \\"Blub\\", a hypothetically average language \\"right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.\\"; published in Hackers & Painters, 2004; the essay was also reprinted in The Planning and Scheduling Working Group Report on Programming Languages , by JM Adams, R Hawkins, C Myers, C Sontag, S Speck It was used by Graham to illustrate a comparison, beyond Turing completeness, of programming language power, and more specifically to illustrate the difficulty of comparing a programming language one knows to one that one does not. Graham considers a hypothetical Blub programmer. When the programmer looks down the \\"power continuum\\", he considers the lower languages to be less powerful because they miss some feature that a Blub programmer is used to. But when he looks up, he fails to realise that he is looking up: he merely sees \\"weird languages\\" with unnecessary features and assumes they are equivalent in power, but with \\"other hairy stuff thrown in as well\\". When Graham considers the point of view of a programmer using a language higher than Blub, he describes that programmer as looking down on Blub and noting its \\"missing\\" features from the point of view of the higher language. Graham describes this as the \\"Blub paradox\\" and concludes that \\"By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one.\\" The concept has been cited by programmers such as Joel Spolsky.

Automation or automatic control is the use of various control systems for operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers and heat treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering and stabilization of ships, aircraft and other applications and vehicles with minimal or reduced human intervention. Automation covers applications ranging from a household thermostat controlling a boiler, to a large industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals. In control complexity, it can range from simple on-off control to multi-variable high-level algorithms. In the simplest type of an automatic control loop, a controller compares a measured value of a process with a desired set value, and processes the resulting error signal to change some input to the process, in such a way that the process stays at its set point despite disturbances. This closed-loop control is an application of negative feedback to a system. The mathematical basis of control theory was begun in the 18th century and advanced rapidly in the 20th. Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices and computers, usually in combination. Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes and ships typically use all these combined techniques. The benefit of automation includes labor savings, savings in electricity costs, savings in material costs, and improvements to quality, accuracy, and precision. The World Bank's World Development Report 2019 shows evidence that the new industries and jobs in the technology sector outweigh the economic effects of workers being displaced by automation. Job losses and downward mobility blamed on Automation has been cited as one of many factors in the resurgence of nationalist, protectionist and populist politics in the US, UK and France, among other countries since the 2010s. The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic (coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when Ford established an automation department. It was during this time that industry was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the 1930s. Minimum human intervention is required to control many large facilities such as this electrical generating station. Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control Fundamentally, there are two types of control loop; open loop control, and closed loop feedback control. In open loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \\"process output\\" (or \\"controlled process variable\\"). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. (The control action is the switching the boiler off and on. The process output is the building temperature). In closed-loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on the process output. In the case of the boiler analogy, this would include a temperature sensor to monitor the building temperature, and thereby feed a signal back to the controller to ensure it maintains the building at the temperature set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop that ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output equal to the \\"Reference input\\" or \\"set point\\". For this reason, closed-loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.\\"Feedback and control systems\\" ‚Äì JJ Di Steffano, AR Stubberud, IJ Williams. Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967 The definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is 'a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.' Likewise, a Feedback Control System is a system that tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using the difference as a means of control. The advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries, is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range.Bennett, Stuart (1992). A history of control engineering, 1930‚Äì1955. IET. p. 48. . The theoretical basis of closed-loop automation is control theory. A flyball governor is an early example of a feedback control system. An increase in speed would make the counterweights move outward, sliding a linkage that tended to close the valve supplying steam, and so slowing the engine. Control actions = Discrete control (on/off) = One of the simplest types of control is on-off control. An example is a thermostat used on household appliances which either opens or closes an electrical contact. (Thermostats were originally developed as true feedback-control mechanisms rather than the on-off common household appliance thermostat.) Sequence control, in which a programmed sequence of discrete operations is performed, often based on system logic that involves system states. An elevator control system is an example of sequence control. =PID controller= A block diagram of a PID controller in a feedback loop, r(t) is the desired process value or \\"set point\\", and y(t) is the measured process value. A proportional‚Äìintegral‚Äìderivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism (controller) widely used in industrial control systems. In a PID loop, the controller continuously calculates an error value e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms, respectively (sometimes denoted P, I, and D) which give their name to the controller type. The theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analog control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and latterly in industrial process computers. =Sequential control and logical sequence or system state control= Sequential control may be either to a fixed sequence or to a logical one that will perform different actions depending on various system states. An example of an adjustable but otherwise fixed sequence is a timer on a lawn sprinkler. States refer to the various conditions that can occur in a use or sequence scenario of the system. An example is an elevator, which uses logic based on the system state to perform certain actions in response to its state and operator input. For example, if the operator presses the floor n button, the system will respond depending on whether the elevator is stopped or moving, going up or down, or if the door is open or closed, and other conditions.The elevator example is commonly used in programming texts, such as Unified modeling language Early development of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt power to a device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed. The total number of relays and cam timers can number into the hundreds or even thousands in some factories. Early programming techniques and languages were needed to make such systems manageable, one of the first being ladder logic, where diagrams of the interconnected relays resembled the rungs of a ladder. Special computers called programmable logic controllers were later designed to replace these collections of hardware with a single, more easily re-programmed unit. In a typical hard wired motor start and stop circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a \\"Start\\" or \\"Run\\" button that activates a pair of electrical relays. The \\"lock-in\\" relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push-button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the motor starter switch (three sets of contacts for three-phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The \\"lock-in\\" contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a \\"stop\\" or \\"off\\" button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay. UML can be used for designing a door system that can only be opened and closedalt= Commonly interlocks are added to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case, an interlock could be added to ensure that the oil pump is running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches, and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits. Solenoid valves are widely used on compressed air or hydraulic fluid for powering actuators on mechanical components. While motors are used to supply continuous rotary motion, actuators are typically a better choice for intermittently creating a limited range of movement for a mechanical component, such as moving various mechanical arms, opening or closing valves, raising heavy press rolls, applying pressure to presses. =Computer control= Computers can perform both sequential control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both in an industrial application. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General-purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand-alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments, and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real-time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers, and management. Control of an automated teller machine (ATM) is an example of an interactive process in which a computer will perform a logic derived response to a user selection based on information retrieved from a networked database. The ATM process has similarities with other online transaction processes. The different logical responses are called scenarios. Such processes are typically designed with the aid of use cases and flowcharts, which guide the writing of the software code. The earliest feedback control mechanism was the water clock invented by Greek engineer Ctesibius (285‚Äì222 BC) History =Early history= Ctesibius's clepsydra (3rd century BC). It was a preoccupation of the Greeks and Arabs (in the period between about 300 BC and about 1200 AD) to keep accurate track of time. In Ptolemaic Egypt, about 270 BC, Ctesibius described a float regulator for a water clock, a device not unlike the ball and cock in a modern flush toilet. This was the earliest feedback controlled mechanism. The appearance of the mechanical clock in the 14th century made the water clock and its feedback control system obsolete. The Persian Ban≈´ M≈´sƒÅ brothers, in their Book of Ingenious Devices (850 AD), described a number of automatic controls.Ahmad Y Hassan, Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering Two-step level controls for fluids, a form of discontinuous variable structure controls, was developed by the Banu Musa brothers. They also described a feedback controller.Otto Mayr (1970). The Origins of Feedback Control, MIT Press.Donald Routledge Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, p. 64-69. =Industrial Revolution in Western Europe= The introduction of prime movers, or self-driven machines advanced grain mills, furnaces, boilers, and the steam engine created a new requirement for automatic control systems including temperature regulators (invented in 1624; see Cornelius Drebbel), pressure regulators (1681), float regulators (1700) and speed control devices. Another control mechanism was used to tent the sails of windmills. It was patented by Edmund Lee in 1745. Also in 1745, Jacques de Vaucanson invented the first automated loom. The design of feedback control systems up through the Industrial Revolution was by trial-and-error, together with a great deal of engineering intuition. Thus, it was more of an art than a science. In the mid-19th century mathematics was first used to analyze the stability of feedback control systems. Since mathematics is the formal language of automatic control theory, we could call the period before this time the prehistory of control theory. In 1771 Richard Arkwright invented the first fully automated spinning mill driven by water power, known at the time as the water frame. An automatic flour mill was developed by Oliver Evans in 1785, making it the first completely automated industrial process. Steam engines are a technology created during the 1700s used to promote automation. The centrifugal governor, which was invented by Christian Huygens in the seventeenth century, was used to adjust the gap between millstones. Another centrifugal governor was used by a Mr. Bunce of England in 1784 as part of a model steam crane. The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt's partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building. The governor could not actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. Several improvements to the governor, plus improvements to valve cut-off timing on the steam engine, made the engine suitable for most industrial uses before the end of the 19th century. Advances in the steam engine stayed well ahead of science, both thermodynamics and control theory. The governor received relatively little scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established the beginning of a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long-distance telephony, required a higher signal to noise ratio, which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems. = 20th century = Relay logic was introduced with factory electrification, which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 through the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth and operation of new high-pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but as late as the early 1930s, most process control was on-off. Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off. Control rooms also used color-coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes. Controllers, which were able to make calculated changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than on- off control, began being introduced the 1930s. Controllers allowed manufacturing to continue showing productivity gains to offset the declining influence of factory electrification. Factory productivity was greatly increased by electrification in the 1920s. U.S. manufacturing productivity growth fell from 5.2%/yr 1919‚Äì29 to 2.76%/yr 1929‚Äì41. Alexander Field notes that spending on non-medical instruments increased significantly from 1929‚Äì33 and remained strong thereafter. The First and Second World Wars saw major advancements in the field of mass communication and signal processing. Other key advances in automatic controls include differential equations, stability theory and system theory (1938), frequency domain analysis (1940), ship control (1950), and stochastic analysis (1941). Starting in 1958, various systems based on solid-state digital logic modules for hard-wired programmed logic controllers (the predecessors of programmable logic controllers (PLC)) emerged to replace electro-mechanical relay logic in industrial control systems for process control and automation, including early Telefunken/AEG Logistat, Siemens Simatic, Philips/Mullard/ Norbit, BBC Sigmatronic, ACEC Logacec, Estacord, Krone Mibakron, Bistat, Datapac, Norlog, SSR, or Procontic systems. In 1959 Texaco's Port Arthur Refinery became the first chemical plant to use digital control. Conversion of factories to digital control began to spread rapidly in the 1970s as the price of computer hardware fell. =Significant applications= The automatic telephone switchboard was introduced in 1892 along with dial telephones. By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic. Automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and electro-mechanical switches, which consumed a large amount of electricity. Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting Bell Labs to begin research on the transistor. The logic performed by telephone switching relays was the inspiration for the digital computer. The first commercially successful glass bottle blowing machine was an automatic model introduced in 1905. The machine, operated by a two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers. Sectional electric drives were developed using control theory. Sectional electric drives are used on different sections of a machine where a precise differential must be maintained between the sections. In steel rolling, the metal elongates as it passes through pairs of rollers, which must run at successively faster speeds. In paper making the paper sheet shrinks as it passes around steam heated drying arranged in groups, which must run at successively slower speeds. The first application of a sectional electric drive was on a paper machine in 1919. One of the most important developments in the steel industry during the 20th century was continuous wide strip rolling, developed by Armco in 1928. Automated pharmacology production Before automation, many chemicals were made in batches. In 1930, with the widespread use of instruments and the emerging use of controllers, the founder of Dow Chemical Co. was advocating continuous production.Note 1 Self-acting machine tools that displaced hand dexterity so they could be operated by boys and unskilled laborers were developed by James Nasmyth in the 1840s. Machine tools were automated with Numerical control (NC) using punched paper tape in the 1950s. This soon evolved into computerized numerical control (CNC). Today extensive automation is practiced in practically every type of manufacturing and assembly process. Some of the larger processes include electrical power generation, oil refining, chemicals, steel mills, plastics, cement plants, fertilizer plants, pulp and paper mills, automobile and truck assembly, aircraft production, glass manufacturing, natural gas separation plants, food and beverage processing, canning and bottling and manufacture of various kinds of parts. Robots are especially useful in hazardous applications like automobile spray painting. Robots are also used to assemble electronic circuit boards. Automotive welding is done with robots and automatic welders are used in applications like pipelines. =Space/computer age= With the advent of the space age in 1957, controls design, particularly in the United States, turned away from the frequency- domain techniques of classical control theory and backed into the differential equation techniques of the late 19th century, which were couched in the time domain. During the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which became widely used in hysteresis control systems such as navigation systems, fire-control systems, and electronics. Through Flugge-Lotz and others, the modern era saw time-domain design for nonlinear systems (1961), navigation (1960), optimal control and estimation theory (1962), nonlinear control theory (1969), digital control and filtering theory (1974), and the personal computer (1983).  Advantages, disadvantages, and limitations  Perhaps the most cited advantage of automation in industry is that it is associated with faster production and cheaper labor costs. Another benefit could be that it replaces hard, physical, or monotonous work. Additionally, tasks that take place in hazardous environments or that are otherwise beyond human capabilities can be done by machines, as machines can operate even under extreme temperatures or in atmospheres that are radioactive or toxic. They can also be maintained with simple quality checks. However, at the time being, not all tasks can be automated, and some tasks are more expensive to automate than others. Initial costs of installing the machinery in factory settings are high, and failure to maintain a system could result in the loss of the product itself. Moreover, some studies seem to indicate that industrial automation could impose ill effects beyond operational concerns, including worker displacement due to systemic loss of employment and compounded environmental damage; however, these findings are both convoluted and controversial in nature, and could potentially be circumvented. The main advantages of automation are: *Increased throughput or productivity. *Improved quality or increased predictability of quality. *Improved robustness (consistency), of processes or product. *Increased consistency of output. *Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses. *Installation in operations reduces cycle time. *Can complete tasks where a high degree of accuracy is required. *Replaces human operators in tasks that involve hard physical or monotonous work (e.g., using one forklift with a single driver instead of a team of multiple workers to lift a heavy object) *Reduces some occupational injuries (e.g., fewer strained backs from lifting heavy objects) *Replaces humans in tasks done in dangerous environments (i.e. fire, space, volcanoes, nuclear facilities, underwater, etc.) *Performs tasks that are beyond human capabilities of size, weight, speed, endurance, etc. *Reduces operation time and work handling time significantly. *Frees up workers to take on other roles. *Provides higher level jobs in the development, deployment, maintenance and running of the automated processes. The main disadvantages of automation are: *Possible security threats/vulnerability due to increased relative susceptibility for committing errors. *Unpredictable or excessive development costs. *High initial cost. *Displaces workers due to job replacement. = Paradox of automation = The paradox of automation says that the more efficient the automated system, the more crucial the human contribution of the operators. Humans are less involved, but their involvement becomes more critical. Lisanne Bainbridge, a cognitive psychologist, identified these issues notably in her widely cited paper \\"Ironies of Automation.\\" If an automated system has an error, it will multiply that error until it is fixed or shut down. This is where human operators come in. A fatal example of this was Air France Flight 447, where a failure of automation put the pilots into a manual situation they were not prepared for. =Limitations= * Current technology is unable to automate all the desired tasks. * Many operations using automation have large amounts of invested capital and produce high volumes of product, making malfunctions extremely costly and potentially hazardous. Therefore, some personnel are needed to ensure that the entire system functions properly and that safety and product quality are maintained. * As a process becomes increasingly automated, there is less and less labor to be saved or quality improvement to be gained. This is an example of both diminishing returns and the logistic function. * As more and more processes become automated, there are fewer remaining non-automated processes. This is an example of the exhaustion of opportunities. New technological paradigms may, however, set new limits that surpass the previous limits. Current limitations Many roles for humans in industrial processes presently lie beyond the scope of automation. Human-level pattern recognition, language comprehension, and language production ability are well beyond the capabilities of modern mechanical and computer systems (but see Watson computer). Tasks requiring subjective assessment or synthesis of complex sensory data, such as scents and sounds, as well as high-level tasks such as strategic planning, currently require human expertise. In many cases, the use of humans is more cost- effective than mechanical approaches even where the automation of industrial tasks is possible. Overcoming these obstacles is a theorized path to post- scarcity economics. =Societal impact and unemployment= Increased automation often causes workers to feel anxious about losing their jobs as technology renders their skills or experience unnecessary. Early in the Industrial Revolution, when inventions like the steam engine were making some job categories expendable, workers forcefully resisted these changes. Luddites, for instance, were English textile workers who protested the introduction of weaving machines by destroying them. More recently, some residents of Chandler, Arizona, have slashed tires and pelted rocks at driver- less cars, in protest over the cars' perceived threat to human safety and job prospects. The relative anxiety about automation reflected in opinion polls seems to correlate closely with the strength of organized labor in that region or nation. For example, while a study by the Pew Research Center indicated that 72% of Americans are worried about increasing automation in the workplace, 80% of Swedes see automation and artificial intelligence as a good thing, due to the country's still-powerful unions and a more robust national safety net. In the United States, 47% of all current jobs have the potential to be fully automated by 2033, according to the research of experts Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne. Furthermore, wages and educational attainment appear to be strongly negatively correlated with an occupation's risk of being automated. Even highly skilled professional jobs like a lawyer, doctor, engineer, journalist are at risk of automation. Prospects are particularly bleak for occupations that do not presently require a university degree, such as truck driving. Even in high-tech corridors like Silicon Valley, concern is spreading about a future in which a sizable percentage of adults have little chance of sustaining gainful employment. As the example of Sweden suggests, however, the transition to a more automated future need not inspire panic, if there is sufficient political will to promote the retraining of workers whose positions are being rendered obsolete. According to a 2020 study in the Journal of Political Economy, automation has robust negative effects on employment and wages: \\"One more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment-to-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42%.\\" Research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of the Oxford Martin School argued that employees engaged in \\"tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms\\" are at risk of displacement, and 47% of jobs in the US were at risk. The study, released as a working paper in 2013 and published in 2017, predicted that automation would put low-paid physical occupations most at risk, by surveying a group of colleagues on their opinions. However, according to a study published in McKinsey Quarterly in 2015 the impact of computerization in most cases is not the replacement of employees but automation of portions of the tasks they perform. The methodology of the McKinsey study has been heavily criticized for being intransparent and relying on subjective assessments. The methodology of Frey and Osborne has been subjected to criticism, as lacking evidence, historical awareness, or credible methodology. In addition the OECD, found that across the 21 OECD countries, 9% of jobs are automatable. The Obama administration has pointed out that every 3 months \\"about 6 percent of jobs in the economy are destroyed by shrinking or closing businesses, while a slightly larger percentage of jobs are added.\\"Executive Office of the President. December 2016. \\"Artificial Intelligence, Automation and the Economy.\\" Pp. 2, 13‚Äì19. A recent MIT economics study of automation in the United States from 1990 to 2007 found that there may be a negative impact on employment and wages when robots are introduced to an industry. When one robot is added per one thousand workers, the employment to population ratio decreases between 0.18‚Äì0.34 percentages and wages are reduced by 0.25‚Äì0.5 percentage points. During the time period studied, the US did not have many robots in the economy which restricts the impact of automation. However, automation is expected to triple (conservative estimate) or quadruple (a generous estimate) leading these numbers to become substantially higher. Based on a formula by Gilles Saint-Paul, an economist at Toulouse 1 University, the demand for unskilled human capital declines at a slower rate than the demand for skilled human capital increases. In the long run and for society as a whole it has led to cheaper products, lower average work hours, and new industries forming (i.e., robotics industries, computer industries, design industries). These new industries provide many high salary skill-based jobs to the economy. By 2030, between 3 and 14 percent of the global workforce will be forced to switch job categories due to automation eliminating jobs in an entire sector. While the number of jobs lost to automation is often offset by jobs gained from technological advances, the same type of job loss is not the same one replaced and that leading to increasing unemployment in the lower-middle class. This occurs largely in the US and developed countries where technological advances contribute to higher demand for highly skilled labor but demand for middle- wage labor continues to fall. Economists call this trend \\"income polarization\\" where unskilled labor wages are driven down and skilled labor is driven up and it is predicted to continue in developed economies. Unemployment is becoming a problem in the United States due to the exponential growth rate of automation and technology. According to Kim, Kim, and Lee (2017:1), \\"[a] seminal study by Frey and Osborne in 2013 predicted that 47% of the 702 examined occupations in the United States faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 10‚Äì25 years as a result of computerization.\\" As many jobs are becoming obsolete, which is causing job displacement, one possible solution would be for the government to assist with a universal basic income (UBI) program. UBI would be a guaranteed, non-taxed income of around $1000 dollars per month, paid to all U.S. citizens over the age of 21. UBI would help those who are displaced, take on jobs that pay less money and still afford to get by. It would also give those that are employed with jobs that are likely to be replaced by automation and technology, extra money to spend on education and training on new demanding employment skills. UBI however, should be seen as a short-term solution because it doesn't fully address the issue of income inequality which will be exacerbated by job displacement. Lights-out manufacturing Lights-out manufacturing is a production system with no human workers, to eliminate labor costs. Lights out manufacturing grew in popularity in the U.S. when General Motors in 1982 implemented humans \\"hands-off\\" manufacturing in order to \\"replace risk-averse bureaucracy with automation and robots\\". However, the factory never reached full \\"lights out\\" status. The expansion of lights out manufacturing requires: * Reliability of equipment * Long-term mechanic capabilities * Planned preventive maintenance * Commitment from the staff Health and environment The costs of automation to the environment are different depending on the technology, product or engine automated. There are automated engines that consume more energy resources from the Earth in comparison with previous engines and vice versa. Hazardous operations, such as oil refining, the manufacturing of industrial chemicals, and all forms of metal working, were always early contenders for automation. The automation of vehicles could prove to have a substantial impact on the environment, although the nature of this impact could be beneficial or harmful depending on several factors. Because automated vehicles are much less likely to get into accidents compared to human-driven vehicles, some precautions built into current models (such as anti-lock brakes or laminated glass) would not be required for self-driving versions. Removing these safety features would also significantly reduce the weight of the vehicle, thus increasing fuel economy and reducing emissions per mile. Self-driving vehicles are also more precise with regard to acceleration and breaking, and this could contribute to reduced emissions. Self-driving cars could also potentially utilize fuel-efficient features such as route mapping that is able to calculate and take the most efficient routes. Despite this potential to reduce emissions, some researchers theorize that an increase of production of self- driving cars could lead to a boom of vehicle ownership and use. This boom could potentially negate any environmental benefits of self-driving cars if a large enough number of people begin driving personal vehicles more frequently. Automation of homes and home appliances is also thought to impact the environment, but the benefits of these features are also questioned. A study of energy consumption of automated homes in Finland showed that smart homes could reduce energy consumption by monitoring levels of consumption in different areas of the home and adjusting consumption to reduce energy leaks (e.g. automatically reducing consumption during the nighttime when activity is low). This study, along with others, indicated that the smart home's ability to monitor and adjust consumption levels would reduce unnecessary energy usage. However, new research suggests that smart homes might not be as efficient as non-automated homes. A more recent study has indicated that, while monitoring and adjusting consumption levels does decrease unnecessary energy use, this process requires monitoring systems that also consume a significant amount of energy. This study suggested that the energy required to run these systems is so much so that it negates any benefits of the systems themselves, resulting in little to no ecological benefit. Convertibility and turnaround time Another major shift in automation is the increased demand for flexibility and convertibility in manufacturing processes. Manufacturers are increasingly demanding the ability to easily switch from manufacturing Product A to manufacturing Product B without having to completely rebuild the production lines. Flexibility and distributed processes have led to the introduction of Automated Guided Vehicles with Natural Features Navigation. Digital electronics helped too. Former analog-based instrumentation was replaced by digital equivalents which can be more accurate and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization, and operation. This was accompanied by the fieldbus revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field-level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring. Discrete manufacturing plants adopted these technologies fast. The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analog-based measurement and control still dominates. The growing use of Industrial Ethernet on the factory floor is pushing these trends still further, enabling manufacturing plants to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems. Automation tools Engineers can now have numerical control over automated devices. The result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. Computer-aided technologies (or CAx) now serve as the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include Computer-aided design (CAD software) and Computer- aided manufacturing (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry. Information technology, together with industrial machinery and processes, can assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems. One example of an industrial control system is a programmable logic controller (PLC). PLCs are specialized hardened computers which are frequently used to synchronize the flow of inputs from (physical) sensors and events with the flow of outputs to actuators and events. An automated online assistant on a website, with an avatar for enhanced human‚Äìcomputer interaction. Human-machine interfaces (HMI) or computer human interfaces (CHI), formerly known as man- machine interfaces, are usually employed to communicate with PLCs and other computers. Service personnel who monitor and control through HMIs can be called by different names. In industrial process and manufacturing environments, they are called operators or something similar. In boiler houses and central utilities departments they are called stationary engineers. Different types of automation tools exist: * ANN ‚Äì Artificial Neural Network * DCS ‚Äì Distributed Control System * HMI ‚Äì Human Machine Interface * SCADA ‚Äì Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition * PLC ‚Äì Programmable Logic Controller * Instrumentation * Motion control * Robotics Host simulation software (HSS) is a commonly used testing tool that is used to test the equipment software. HSS is used to test equipment performance with respect to factory automation standards (timeouts, response time, processing time).  Cognitive automation  Cognitive automation, as a subset of artificial intelligence, is an emerging genus of automation enabled by cognitive computing. Its primary concern is the automation of clerical tasks and workflows that consist of structuring unstructured data. Cognitive automation relies on multiple disciplines: natural language processing, real-time computing, machine learning algorithms, big data analytics, and evidence-based learning. According to Deloitte, cognitive automation enables the replication of human tasks and judgment \\"at rapid speeds and considerable scale.\\" Such tasks include: *Document redaction *Data extraction and document synthesis / reporting *Contract management *Natural language search * Customer, employee, and stakeholder onboarding * Manual activities and verifications * Follow-up and email communications Recent and emerging applications = Automated power production = Technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable energy sources‚Äîtogether with smart grids, micro-grids, battery storage‚Äîcan automate power production. =Retail= Many supermarkets and even smaller stores are rapidly introducing Self checkout systems reducing the need for employing checkout workers. In the United States, the retail industry employs 15.9 million people as of 2017 (around 1 in 9 Americans in the workforce). Globally, an estimated 192 million workers could be affected by automation according to research by Eurasia Group. A soft drink vending machine in Japan, example of automated retail Online shopping could be considered a form of automated retail as the payment and checkout are through an automated Online transaction processing system, with the share of online retail accounting jumping from 5.1% in 2011 to 8.3% in 2016 . However, two- thirds of books, music, and films are now purchased online. In addition, automation and online shopping could reduce demands for shopping malls, and retail property, which in America is currently estimated to account for 31% of all commercial property or around 7 billion square feet. Amazon has gained much of the growth in recent years for online shopping, accounting for half of the growth in online retail in 2016. Other forms of automation can also be an integral part of online shopping, for example, the deployment of automated warehouse robotics such as that applied by Amazon using Kiva Systems.

The mining industry is currently in the transition towards automation. Currently, it can still require a large amount of human capital, particularly in the third world where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency through automation. =Video surveillance= The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started the research and development of automated visual surveillance and monitoring (VSAM) program, between 1997 and 1999, and airborne video surveillance (AVS) programs, from 1998 to 2002. Currently, there is a major effort underway in the vision community to develop a fully- automated tracking surveillance system. Automated video surveillance monitors people and vehicles in real time within a busy environment. Existing automated surveillance systems are based on the environment they are primarily designed to observe, i.e., indoor, outdoor or airborne, the number of sensors that the automated system can handle and the mobility of sensor, i.e., stationary camera vs. mobile camera. The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.Javed, O, & Shah, M. (2008). Automated multi-camera surveillance. City of Publication: Springer-Verlag New York Inc. =Highway systems= As demands for safety and mobility have grown and technological possibilities have multiplied, interest in automation has grown. Seeking to accelerate the development and introduction of fully automated vehicles and highways, the United States Congress authorized more than $650 million over six years for intelligent transport systems (ITS) and demonstration projects in the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Congress legislated in ISTEA that:Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act 1991, part B, Section 6054(b) > [T]he Secretary of Transportation shall develop an automated highway and > vehicle prototype from which future fully automated intelligent vehicle- > highway systems can be developed. Such development shall include research in > human factors to ensure the success of the man-machine relationship. The > goal of this program is to have the first fully automated highway roadway or > an automated test track in operation by 1997. This system shall accommodate > installation of equipment in new and existing motor vehicles. Full automation commonly defined as requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished through a combination of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully automated driving would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.Menzies, Thomas R., ed. 1998. \\"National Automated Highway System Research Program: A Review.\\" Transportation Research Board Special Report 253.

Robotic process automation (RPA; or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0) is an emerging field within BPA and uses artificial intelligence. BPAs can be implemented in a number of business areas including marketing,\\"Understanding the Evolution and Importance of Business Process Automation.\\" Smartsheet. 2020.

The rise in the usage of home automation solutions has taken a turn reflecting the increased dependency of people on such automation solutions. However, the increased comfort that gets added through these automation solutions is remarkable. =Laboratory= Automated laboratory instrument Automation is essential for many scientific and clinical applications. Therefore, automation has been extensively employed in laboratories. From as early as 1980 fully automated laboratories have already been working. However, automation has not become widespread in laboratories due to its high cost. This may change with the ability of integrating low-cost devices with standard laboratory equipment. Autosamplers are common devices used in laboratory automation. =Logistics automation= =Industrial automation= Industrial automation deals primarily with the automation of manufacturing, quality control, and material handling processes. General purpose controllers for industrial processes include programmable logic controllers, stand-alone I/O modules, and computers. Industrial automation is to replace the decision making of humans and manual command- response activities with the use of mechanized equipment and logical programming commands. One trend is increased use of machine vision to provide automatic inspection and robot guidance functions, another is a continuing increase in the use of robots. Industrial automation is simply required in industries. Energy efficiency in industrial processes has become a higher priority. Semiconductor companies like Infineon Technologies are offering 8-bit micro-controller applications for example found in motor controls, general purpose pumps, fans, and ebikes to reduce energy consumption and thus increase efficiency. Industrial Automation and Industry 4.0 The rise of industrial automation is directly tied to the ‚ÄúFourth Industrial Revolution‚Äù, which is better known now as Industry 4.0. Originating from Germany, Industry 4.0 encompasses numerous devices, concepts, and machines, as well as the advancement of the industrial internet of things (IIoT). An \\"Internet of Things is a seamless integration of diverse physical objects in the Internet through a virtual representation.\\" These new revolutionary advancements have drawn attention to the world of automation in an entirely new light and shown ways for it to grow to increase productivity and efficiency in machinery and manufacturing facilities. Industry 4.0 works with the IIoT and software/hardware to connect in a way that (through communication technologies) add enhancements and improve manufacturing processes. Being able to create smarter, safer, and more advanced manufacturing is now possible with these new technologies. It opens up a manufacturing platform that is more reliable, consistent, and efficient than before. Implementation of systems such as SCADA is an example of software that takes place in Industrial Automation today. SCADA is a supervisory data collection software, just one of the many used in Industrial Automation. Industry 4.0 vastly covers many areas in manufacturing and will continue to do so as time goes on. Industrial robotics Automated milling machines Industrial robotics is a sub-branch in industrial automation that aids in various manufacturing processes. Such manufacturing processes include machining, welding, painting, assembling and material handling to name a few. Industrial robots use various mechanical, electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision, accuracy and speed that far exceed any human performance. The birth of industrial robots came shortly after World War II as the United States saw the need for a quicker way to produce industrial and consumer goods. Servos, digital logic and solid-state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and over time these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance. In 1997, there were 700,000 industrial robots in use, the number has risen to 1.8M in 2017 In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) with robotics is also used in creating an automatic labelling solution, using robotic arms as the automatic label applicator, and AI for learning and detecting the products to be labelled. Programmable Logic Controllers Industrial automation incorporates programmable logic controllers in the manufacturing process. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) use a processing system which allows for variation of controls of inputs and outputs using simple programming. PLCs make use of programmable memory, storing instructions and functions like logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc. Using a logic- based language, a PLC can receive a variety of inputs and return a variety of logical outputs, the input devices being sensors and output devices being motors, valves, etc. PLCs are similar to computers, however, while computers are optimized for calculations, PLCs are optimized for control task and use in industrial environments. They are built so that only basic logic-based programming knowledge is needed and to handle vibrations, high temperatures, humidity, and noise. The greatest advantage PLCs offer is their flexibility. With the same basic controllers, a PLC can operate a range of different control systems. PLCs make it unnecessary to rewire a system to change the control system. This flexibility leads to a cost-effective system for complex and varied control systems. Siemens Simatic S7-400 system in a rack, left-to- right: power supply unit (PSU), CPU, interface module (IM) and communication processor (CP). PLCs can range from small \\"building brick\\" devices with tens of I/O in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and SCADA systems. They can be designed for multiple arrangements of digital and analog inputs and outputs (I/O), extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non- volatile memory. It was from the automotive industry in the USA that the PLC was born. Before the PLC, control, sequencing, and safety interlock logic for manufacturing automobiles was mainly composed of relays, cam timers, drum sequencers, and dedicated closed-loop controllers. Since these could number in the hundreds or even thousands, the process for updating such facilities for the yearly model change-over was very time-consuming and expensive, as electricians needed to individually rewire the relays to change their operational characteristics. When digital computers became available, being general-purpose programmable devices, they were soon applied to control sequential and combinatorial logic in industrial processes. However, these early computers required specialist programmers and stringent operating environmental control for temperature, cleanliness, and power quality. To meet these challenges this the PLC was developed with several key attributes. It would tolerate the shop-floor environment, it would support discrete (bit- form) input and output in an easily extensible manner, it would not require years of training to use, and it would permit its operation to be monitored. Since many industrial processes have timescales easily addressed by millisecond response times, modern (fast, small, reliable) electronics greatly facilitate building reliable controllers, and performance could be traded off for reliability.E. A. Parr, Industrial Control Handbook, Industrial Press Inc., 1999 Agent-assisted automation Agent-assisted automation refers to automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries. The key benefit of agent-assisted automation is compliance and error-proofing. Agents are sometimes not fully trained or they forget or ignore key steps in the process. The use of automation ensures that what is supposed to happen on the call actually does, every time. There are two basic types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions. Desktop automation refers to software programming that makes it easier for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools. The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it did not have to be entered more than once, for example. Automated voice solutions allow the agents to remain on the line while disclosures and other important information is provided to customers in the form of pre-recorded audio files. Specialized applications of these automated voice solutions enable the agents to process credit cards without ever seeing or hearing the credit card numbers or CVV codes See also * Automated storage and retrieval system * Automation technician * Cognitive computing * Control engineering * Cybernetics * Data- driven control system * Dirty, dangerous and demeaning * Feedforward control * Futures studies * Industrial Revolution * Ludditism * Machine to machine * Mobile manipulator * Multi-agent system * Post-work society * Process control * Productivity improving technologies * Robot tax * Robotic process automation * Semi-automation * Industry 4.0 * Technological unemployment  References  = Citations = = Sources =  E.

The Sharpless epoxidation The stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide is determined by the enantiomer of the chiral tartrate diester (usually diethyl tartrate or diisopropyl tartrate) employed in the reaction. The oxidizing agent is tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Enantioselectivity is achieved by a catalyst formed from titanium tetra(isopropoxide) and diethyl tartrate. Only 5‚Äì10 mol% of the catalyst in the presence of 3√Ö molecular sieves (3√Ö MS) is necessary. The success of the Sharpless epoxidation can be attributed to five major aspects. First, epoxides can be easily converted into diols, aminoalcohols, and ethers, so formation of chiral epoxides is important in the synthesis of natural products. Second, substrate scope is large, including many primary and secondary allylic alcohols. Third, the products of the Sharpless epoxidation frequently have enantiomeric excesses above 90%. Fourth, the products of the Sharpless epoxidation are predictable. Finally, the reactants for the Sharpless epoxidation are commercially available and relatively inexpensive. Several reviews have been published. K. Barry Sharpless shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on asymmetric oxidations. The prize was shared with William S. Knowles and Ry≈çji Noyori. Catalyst structure The structure of the catalyst is uncertain. Regardless, all studies have concluded that the catalyst is a dimer of [Ti(tartrate)(OR)2]. The putative catalyst was determined using X-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the Sharpless epoxidation. Transition state Selectivity The chirality of the product of a Sharpless epoxidation is sometimes predicted with the following mnemonic. A rectangle is drawn around the double bond in the same plane as the carbons of the double bond (the xy- plane), with the allylic alcohol in the bottom right corner and the other substituents in their appropriate corners. In this orientation, the (‚àí) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the top half of the molecule, and the (+) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the bottom half of the molecule. This model seems to be valid despite substitution on the olefin. Selectivity decreases with larger R1, but increases with larger R2 and R3 (see introduction). The Sharpless epoxidation However, this method incorrectly predicts the product of allylic 1,2-diols. Sharpless model violation Kinetic resolution The Sharpless epoxidation can also give kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of secondary 2,3-epoxyalcohols. While the yield of a kinetic resolution process cannot be higher than 50%, the enantiomeric excess approaches 100% in some reactions. Kinetic resolution Synthetic utility The Sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols. Furthermore, with the exception noted above, a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene. To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the Sharpless epoxidation, the Sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products: methymycin, erythromycin, leukotriene C-1, and (+)-disparlure. Utility As one of the few highly enantioselective reactions during its time, many manipulations of the 2,3-epoxyalcohols have been developed. The Sharpless epoxidation has been used for the total synthesis of various saccharides, terpenes, leukotrienes, pheromones, and antibiotics. The main drawback of this protocol is the necessity of the presence of an allylic alcohol. The Jacobsen epoxidation, an alternative method to enantioselectively oxidise alkenes, overcomes this issue and tolerates a wider array of functional groups. Background on epoxidation of allylic alcohols Early work showed that allylic alcohols give facial selectivity when using m-CPBA as an oxidant. This selectivity was reversed when the allylic alcohol was acetylated. This finding leads to the conclusion that hydrogen bonding played a key role in selectivity and the following model was proposed. 750px For cyclic allylic alcohols, greater selectivity is seen when the alcohol was locked in the pseudo equatorial position rather than the pseudo axial position. However, it was found that for metal catalyzed systems such as those based on vanadium, reaction rates were accelerated when the hydroxyl group was in the axial position by a factor of 34. Substrates which were locked in the pseudo equatorial position were shown to undergo oxidation to form the ene- one. In both cases of vanadium catalyzed epoxidations, the epoxidzed product showed excellent selectivity for the syn diastereomer. 750px In the absence of hydrogen bonding, steric effects direct peroxide addition to the opposite face. However, perfluoric peracids are still able to hydrogen bond with protected alcohols and give normal selectivity with the hydrogen present on the peracid. 300px Although the presence of an allylic alcohol does lead to increased stereoselectivity, the rates of these reactions are slower than systems lacking alcohols. However, the reaction rates of substrates with a hydrogen bonding group are still faster than the equivalent protected substrates. This observation is attributed to a balance of two factors. The first is the stabilization of the transition state as a result of the hydrogen bonding. The second is the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen, which draws electron density away from the alkene, lowering its reactivity. 500px Acyclic allylic alcohols exhibit good selectivity as well. In these systems both A1,2 (steric interactions with vinyl) and A1,3 strain are considered. It has been shown that a dihedral angle of 120 best directs substrates which hydrogen bond with the directing group. This geometry allows for the peroxide to be properly positioned, as well as to allow minimal donation from the C-C pi into the C-O sigma star.Houk, K. N.; Paddon-Row, M. N.; Rondan, N. G.; Wu, Y. D.; Brown, F. K.; Spellmeyer, D. C.; Metz, J. T.; Li, Y .; Loncharich, R. J. Science, 1986, 231, 1108-1117. This donation would lower the electron density of the alkene, and deactivate the reaction. However,vanadium complexes do not hydrogen bond with their substrates. Instead they coordinate with the alcohol. This means that a dihedral angle of 40 allows for ideal position of the peroxide sigma star orbital.Waldemar, A.; Wirth, T. Accounts of Chemical Research, 1999, 32.8, 703-710. 750px In systems that hydrogen bond, A1,3 strain plays a larger role because the required geometry forces any allylic substituents to have severe A1,3 interactions, but avoids A1,2. This leads to syn addition of the resulting epoxide. In the vanadium case, the required geometry leads to severe A1,2 interactions, but avoids A1,3, leading to formation of the epoxide anti to the directing group. Vanadium catalyzed epoxidations have been shown to be very sensitive to the steric bulk of the vinyl group. 500px Homoallylic alcohols are effective directing groups for epoxidations in both cyclic and acyclic systems for substrates which show hydrogen bonding. However these reactions tend to have lower levels of selectivity.Johnson, M. R.; Kishi, Y. Tetrahedron Lett., 1979, 4347-4350. 500px While hydrogen bonding substrates give the same type of selectivity in allylic and homoallylic cases, the opposite is true of vanadium catalysts. 750px A transition state proposed by Mihelich shows that for these reactions, the driving force for selectivity is minimizing A1,3 strain in a pseudo chair structure. The proposed transition state shows that the substrate will try to assume a conformation which minimizes the allyic strain. To do this, the least sterially bulky R group will rotate to assume the R4 position. Although peracids and metal catalyzed expoidations show different selectivity in acyclic systems, they show relatively similar selectivity in cyclic systems For cyclic ring systems that are smaller seven or smaller or 10 or lager, similar patterns of selectivity are observed. However it has been shown that for medium-sized rings (eight and nine) peracid oxidizers show reverse selectivity, while vanadium catalyzed reactions continue to show formation of the syn epoxide. 1500px Although it is the least reactive metal catalyst for epoxidations, vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols. Early work done by Sharpless shows its preference for reacting with alkenes with allylic alcohols over more substituted electron dense alkenes. In this case, Vanadium showed reverse regioselectivity from both m-CPBA and the more reactive molybdenum species. Although vanadium is generally less reactive than other metal complexes, in the presence of allylic alcohols, the rate of the reaction is accelerated beyond that of molybdenum, the most reactive metal for epoxidations.Sharpless, K.

The version history is covered in detail in the NEWS file included with the source distribution. Usage Units will output the result of the conversion in two lines. Usually, the first line (multiplication) is the desired result; the second line is the same conversion expressed as a division. Units can also function as a general-purpose scientific calculator; it includes several built-in mathematical functions such as sin, cos, atan, ln, exp, etc. If you attempt to convert types of measurements that are incompatible, units will print a conformability error message and display a reduced form of each measurement.

It is meant to increase the capacity of roads via an automated highway system. Platoons decrease the distances between cars or trucks using electronic, and possibly mechanical, coupling. This capability would allow many cars or trucks to accelerate or brake simultaneously. This system also allows for a closer headway between vehicles by eliminating reacting distance needed for human reaction. Platoon capability might require buying new vehicles, or it may be something that can be retrofitted. Drivers would probably need a special license endorsement on account of the new skills required and the added responsibility when driving in the lead. Smart cars with artificial intelligence could automatically join and leave platoons. The automated highway system is a proposal for one such system, where cars organise themselves into platoons of 8 to 25.  Potential benefits  * Greater fuel economy due to reduced air resistance. * Reduced congestion. * Substantially shorter commutes during peak periods. * On longer highway trips, vehicles could be mostly unattended whilst in following mode. * Fewer traffic collisions. Potential disadvantages * Some systems have failed in traffic, as they have been hacked by remote computers, creating a hazardous situation.https://www.wired.com/2016/08/researchers-hack-big-rig-truck-hijack- accelerator-brakes/https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-hacking- idUSL1N1011QN20150721http://kodsiengineering.com/commercial-vehicle-hacking- the-new-hacking-frontier/ * Drivers would feel less in control of their own driving, being at the hands of computer software or the lead driver. * Drivers may be less attentive than usual, and they may not be able to react as quickly to adverse situations if the software or hardware were to fail.  Automated highway system  An automated highway system (AHS), or smart road, is a proposed intelligent transportation system technology designed to provide for driverless cars on specific right-of ways. It is most often recommended as a means of traffic congestion relief, on the grounds that it would drastically reduce following distances and headway, thus allowing a given stretch of road to carry more cars. = Principle = In one scheme, the roadway has magnetized stainless-steel spikes driven one meter apart in its center. The car senses the spikes to measure its speed and locate the center of the lane. Furthermore, the spikes can have either magnetic north or magnetic south facing up. The roadway thus provides small amounts of digital data describing interchanges and recommended speeds. The cars have power steering and automatic speed controls, which are controlled by a computer. The cars organize themselves into platoons of 8 to 25 cars. The cars within a platoon drive themselves a meter apart, so that air resistance is minimized. The distance between platoons is the conventional braking distance. If anything goes wrong, the maximum number of harmed cars should be one platoon. An overview of platooning systems is given in Bergenhem et al.Carl Bergenhem, Henrik Pettersson, Erik Coelingh, Cristofer Englund, Steven Shladover, Sadayuki Tsugawa, ‚ÄúOverview of Platooning Systems‚Äù, ITS World Congress, Vienna, 22‚Äì26 October 2012 Platooning of trucks has been proposed as a concept to reduce the energy consumption of semi-trucks and improve the feasibility of electric semi-trucks. Significant cost savings can be attained if platooning can be combined with drivers that can rest while driving in platoons. These savings vastly outweigh the direct fuel-savings. = Early development = The origin of research on AHS was done by a team from Ohio State University led by Dr. Robert E. Fenton, based on funding from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration. Their first automated vehicle was built in 1962, and is believed to be the first land vehicle to contain a computer. Steering, braking and speed were controlled through the onboard electronics, which filled the trunk, back seat and most of the front of the passenger side of the car. Research continued at OSU until federal funding was cut in the early 1980s. = Deployments = United States The USDOT-sponsored National Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC) project, a prototype automated highway system, was tested in San Diego County, California in 1997 along Interstate 15. However, despite the technical success of the program, investment has moved more toward autonomous intelligent vehicles rather than building specialized infrastructure. The AHS system places sensory technology in cars that can read passive road markings, and use radar and inter-car communications to make the cars organize themselves without the intervention of drivers. Such an autonomous cruise control system is being developed by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen and Toyota.Engineering Newsletters - ASME . Memagazine.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-04.

SARTRE The SARTRE Project (Safe Road Trains for the Environment), is a European Commission funded project investigating implementation of platooning on unmodified European motorways. The project begun in September 2009, and vehicle platooning, as envisaged by the SARTRE project, is a convoy of vehicles in which a professional driver in a lead vehicle heads a line of closely following vehicles. Each following vehicle autonomously measures the distance, speed and direction and adjusts to the vehicle in front. Once in the platoon, drivers can do other things while the platoon proceeds towards its long-haul destination. All vehicles are detached and can leave the procession at any time. In January 2011, SARTRE made the first successful demonstration of its platooning technology at the Volvo Proving Ground near Gothenburg, Sweden, in which a lead truck was followed by a car. In January 2012, SARTRE made a second demonstration in Barcelona, Spain, in which a lead truck was followed by three cars driven entirely autonomously at speeds of up to with a gap between of at most .

This woodblock is from De re metallica by George Bauer (pen name Georgius Agricola, ca. 1555) an early mining textbook that contains numerous drawings and descriptions of mining equipment. Mechanization is the process of changing from working largely or exclusively by hand or with animals to doing that work with machinery. In an early engineering text a machine is defined as follows: In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools. In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an ungeared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines. After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.Jerome (1934) gives the industry classification of machine tools as being \\"other than hand power\\". Beginning with the 1900 U.S. census, power use was part of the definition of a factory, distinguishing it from a workshop. Extension of mechanization of the production process is termed as automation and it is controlled by a closed loop system in which feedback is provided by the sensors. It controls the operations of different machines automatically.Mechanization & Automation , Mechanical Engineering Community, retrieved 2018-04-17. History The Salisbury Cathedral clock ca. 1386. A clock is a mechanical instrument rather than a true machine. Although this clock had iron gears, many machines of the early Industrial Revolution used wooden parts until around 1800. =Ancient times= Water wheels date to the Roman period and were used to grind grain and lift irrigation water. Water powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in China in 31 AD. By the 13th century, water wheels powered sawmills and trip hammers, to pull cloth and pound flax and later cotton rags into pulp for making paper. Trip hammers are shown crushing ore in De re Metallica (1555). Clocks were some of the most complex early mechanical devices. Clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines, and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs. Clocks were some of the earliest mass-produced items, beginning around 1830.. Reprinted by McGraw-Hill, New York and London, 1926 (); and by Lindsay Publications, Inc., Bradley, Illinois, (). Water powered bellows for blast furnaces, used in China in ancient times, were in use in Europe by the 15th century. De re Metallica contains drawings related to bellows for blast furnaces including a fabrication drawing. Improved gear designs decreased wear and increased efficiency. Mathematical gear designs were developed in the mid 17th century. French mathematician and engineer Desargues designed and constructed the first mill with epicycloidal teeth ca. 1650. In the 18th century involute gears, another mathematical derived design, came into use. Involute gears are better for meshing gears of different sizes than epicycloidal. Gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century. =Industrial revolution= The Newcomen steam engine was first used, to pump water from a mine, in 1712. John Smeaton introduced metal gears and axles to water wheels in the mid to last half of the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution started mainly with textile machinery, such as the spinning jenny (1764) and water frame (1768). Demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s. After the early decades of the 19th century, iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery. In the 1840s self acting machine tools were developed. Machinery was developed to make nails ca. 1810. The Fourdrinier paper machine paper machine for continuous production of paper was patented in 1801, displacing the centuries-old hand method of making individual sheets of paper. One of the first mechanical devices used in agriculture was the seed drill invented by Jethro Tull around 1700. The seed drill allowed more uniform spacing of seed and planting depth than hand methods, increasing yields and saving valuable seed. In 1817, the first bicycle was invented and used in Germany. Mechanized agriculture greatly increased in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries with horse drawn reapers and horse powered threshing machines.. By the late nineteenth century steam power was applied to threshing and steam tractors appeared. Internal combustion began being used for tractors in the early twentieth century. Threshing and harvesting was originally done with attachments for tractors, but in the 1930s independently powered combine harvesters were in use. In the mid to late 19th century, hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions, such as positioning tools or work pieces. Pile drivers and steam hammers are examples for heavy work. In food processing, pneumatic or hydraulic devices could start and stop filling of cans or bottles on a conveyor. Power steering for automobiles uses hydraulic mechanisms, as does practically all earth moving equipment and other construction equipment and many attachments to tractors. Pneumatic (usually compressed air) power is widely used to operate industrial valves. =Twentieth century= By the early 20th century machines developed the ability to perform more complex operations that had previously been done by skilled craftsmen. An example is the glass bottle making machine developed 1905. It replaced highly paid glass blowers and child labor helpers and led to the mass production of glass bottles. After 1900 factories were electrified, and electric motors and controls were used to perform more complicated mechanical operations. This resulted in mechanized processes to manufacture almost all goods. =Categories= Two involute gears, the left driving the right: Blue arrows show the contact forces between them. The force line (or Line of Action) runs along a tangent common to both base circles. (In this situation, there is no force, and no contact needed, along the opposite common tangent not shown.) The involutes here are traced out in converse fashion: points (of contact) move along the stationary force-vector \\"string\\" as if it was being unwound from the left rotating base circle, and wound onto the right rotating base circle. In manufacturing, mechanization replaced hand methods of making goods. Prime movers are devices that convert thermal, potential or kinetic energy into mechanical work. Prime movers include internal combustion engines, combustion turbines (jet engines), water wheels and turbines, windmills and wind turbines and steam engines and turbines. Powered transportation equipment such as locomotives, automobiles and trucks and airplanes, is a classification of machinery which includes sub classes by engine type, such as internal combustion, combustion turbine and steam. Inside factories, warehouses, lumber yards and other manufacturing and distribution operations, material handling equipment replaced manual carrying or hand trucks and carts. Mechanized agriculture *See:Mechanized agriculture *See also: Productivity improving technologies (historical) Section 4 *See also: list of agricultural machinery In mining and excavation, power shovels replaced picks and shovels. Rock and ore crushing had been done for centuries by water powered trip hammers, but trip hammers have been replaced by modern ore crushers and ball mills. Bulk material handling systems and equipment are used for a variety of materials including coal, ores, grains, sand, gravel and wood products. Construction equipment includes cranes, concrete mixers, concrete pumps, cherry pickers and an assortment of power tools. =Powered machinery= Powered machinery today usually means either by electric motor or internal combustion engine. Before the first decade of the 20th century powered usually meant by steam engine, water or wind. Many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered, but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century. Before electrification, mill and factory power was usually transmitted using a line shaft. Electrification allowed individual machines to each be powered by a separate motor in what is called unit drive. Unit drive allowed factories to be better arranged and allowed different machines to run at different speeds. Unit drive also allowed much higher speeds, which was especially important for machine tools. A step beyond mechanization is automation. Early production machinery, such as the glass bottle blowing machine (ca. 1890s), required a lot of operator involvement. By the 1920s fully automatic machines, which required much less operator attention, were being used. See: Mass production = Military usage = The term is also used in the military to refer to the use of tracked armoured vehicles, particularly armoured personnel carriers, to move troops that would otherwise have marched or ridden trucks into combat. In military terminology, mechanized refers to ground units that can fight from vehicles, while motorized refers to units that go to battle in vehicles but then dismount and fight without them. Thus, a towed artillery unit is considered motorized while a self-propelled one is mechanized. Mechanical vs human labour When we compare the efficiency of a labourer, we see that he has an efficiency of about 1%-5.5% (depending on whether he uses arms, or a combination of arms and legs). Internal combustion engines mostly have an efficiency of about 20%,IC Engine 20% efficient although large diesel engines, such as those used to power ships, may have efficiencies of nearly 50%. Industrial electric motors have efficiencies up to the low 90% range, before correcting for the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity of about 35%. When we compare the costs of using an internal combustion engine to a worker to perform work, we notice that an engine can perform more work at a comparative cost. 1 liter of fossil fuel burnt with an IC engine equals about 50 hands of workers operating for 24 hours or 275 arms and legs for 24 hours.1 liter of fuel yielding 100 arms for 24 hours, when efficiency is 40% which is neverHome documentary by Yann Arthus Bertrand too stating that 1 liter of fuel yields 100 arms for 24 hours; probably from same calculation In addition, the combined work capability of a human is also much lower than that of a machine. An average human worker can provide work good for around 0,9 hp (2.3 MJ per hour) while a machine (depending on the type and size) can provide for far greater amounts of work. For example, it takes more than one and a half hour of hard labour to deliver only one kWh - which a small engine could deliver in less than one hour while burning less than one litre of petroleum fuel. This implies that a gang of 20 to 40 men will require a financial compensation for their work at least equal to the required expended food calories (which is at least 4 to 20 times higher). In most situations, the worker will also want compensation for the lost time, which is easily 96 times greater per day. Even if we assume the real wage cost for the human labour to be at US $1.00/day, an energy cost is generated of about $4.00/kWh. Despite this being a low wage for hard labour, even in some of the countries with the lowest wages, it represents an energy cost that is significantly more expensive than even exotic power sources such as solar photovoltaic panels (and thus even more expensive when compared to wind energy harvesters or luminescent solar concentrators).Combined work capability of human vs machines  Levels of mechanization  For simplification, one can study mechanization as a series of steps.Mechanization and its level Many students refer to this series as indicating basic-to-advanced forms of mechanical society. # hand/muscle power # hand-tools # powered hand-tools, e.g. electric-controlled # powered tools, single functioned, fixed cycle # powered tools, multi-functioned, program controlled # powered tools, remote-controlled # powered tools, activated by work-piece (e.g.: coin phone) # measurement # selected signaling control, e.g. hydro power control # performance recording # machine action altered through measurement # segregation/rejection according to measurement # selection of appropriate action cycle # correcting performance after operation # correcting performance during operation  See also  * Automation * History of the bicycle * Productivity improving technologies (historical)#4.

A whistler is a very low frequency or VLF electromagnetic (radio) wave generated by lightning. Originally published by Stanford University Press, Stanford, California (1965). Frequencies of terrestrial whistlers are 1 kHz to 30 kHz, with a maximum amplitude usually at 3 kHz to 5 kHz. Although they are electromagnetic waves, they occur at audio frequencies, and can be converted to audio using a suitable receiver. They are produced by lightning strikes (mostly intracloud and return-path) where the impulse travels along the Earth's magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other. They undergo dispersion of several kHz due to the slower velocity of the lower frequencies through the plasma environments of the ionosphere and magnetosphere. Thus they are perceived as a descending tone which can last for a few seconds. The study of whistlers categorizes them into Pure Note, Diffuse, 2-Hop, and Echo Train types. Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft detected whistler-like activity in the vicinity of Jupiter known as \\"Jovian Whistlers\\", implying the presence of lightning there. Source The pulse of electromagnetic energy of a lightning discharge producing whistlers contains a wide range of frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency. Due to interactions with free electrons in the ionosphere, the waves becomes highly dispersive and like guided waves, follow the lines of geomagnetic field. These lines provide the field with sufficient focusing influence and prevents the scattering of field energy. Their paths reach into the outer space as far as 3 to 4 times the Earth's radius in the plane of equator and bring energy from lightning discharge to the Earth at a point in the opposite hemisphere which is the magnetic conjugate of the position of radio emission for whistlers. From there, the whistler waves are reflected back to the hemisphere from which they started. The energy is almost perfectly reflected from earth surface 4 or 5 times with increase dispersion and diminishing amplitude. Along such long paths the speed of propagation of energy is between c/10 to c/100 and the exact value depends upon frequency. History Whistlers were probably heard as early as 1886 on long telephone lines, but the clearest early description was by Barkhausen in 1919. In 1953, Storey showed that whistlers originate from lightning discharges. Nomenclature A type of electromagnetic signal propagating in the Earth‚Äìionosphere waveguide, known as a radio atmospheric signal or sferic, may escape the ionosphere and propagate outward into the magnetosphere. The signal is prone to bounce-mode propagation, reflecting back and forth on opposite sides of the planet until totally attenuated. To clarify which part of this hop pattern the signal is in, it is specified by a number, indicating the portion of the bounce path it is currently on. On its first upward path, it is known as a \`0+\`. After passing the geomagnetic equator, it is referred to as a \`1‚àí\`. The + or - sign indicates either upward or downward propagation, respectively. The numeral represents the half-bounce currently in progress. The reflected signal is redesignated \`1+\`, until passing the geomagnetic equator again; then it is called \`2‚àí\`, and so on.  Finding of whistlers  Whistlers were first detected during World War 1. On the wide-band spectrogram, the observed characteristic of a whistler is that the tone rapidly descends over a few seconds. This is the origin of the name \\"whistlers\\".

The purpose is to find a realization of the filter that meets each of the requirements to a sufficient degree to make it useful. The filter design process can be described as an optimization problem where each requirement contributes to an error function which should be minimized. Certain parts of the design process can be automated, but normally an experienced electrical engineer is needed to get a good result.  Typical design requirements  Typical requirements which are considered in the design process are: * The filter should have a specific frequency response * The filter should have a specific phase shift or group delay * The filter should have a specific impulse response * The filter should be causal * The filter should be stable * The filter should be localized (pulse or step inputs should result in finite time outputs) * The computational complexity of the filter should be low * The filter should be implemented in particular hardware or software = The frequency function = An important parameter is the required frequency response. In particular, the steepness and complexity of the response curve is a deciding factor for the filter order and feasibility. A first-order recursive filter will only have a single frequency-dependent component. This means that the slope of the frequency response is limited to 6 dB per octave. For many purposes, this is not sufficient. To achieve steeper slopes, higher-order filters are required. In relation to the desired frequency function, there may also be an accompanying weighting function, which describes, for each frequency, how important it is that the resulting frequency function approximates the desired one. The larger weight, the more important is a close approximation. Typical examples of frequency function are: * A low-pass filter is used to cut unwanted high-frequency signals. * A high-pass filter passes high frequencies fairly well; it is helpful as a filter to cut any unwanted low-frequency components. * A band-pass filter passes a limited range of frequencies. * A band-stop filter passes frequencies above and below a certain range. A very narrow band-stop filter is known as a notch filter. * A differentiator has an amplitude response proportional to the frequency. * A low-shelf filter passes all frequencies, but increases or reduces frequencies below the shelf frequency by specified amount. * A high-shelf filter passes all frequencies, but increases or reduces frequencies above the shelf frequency by specified amount. * A peak EQ filter makes a peak or a dip in the frequency response, commonly used in parametric equalizers. = Phase and group delay = * An all-pass filter passes through all frequencies unchanged, but changes the phase of the signal. Filters of this type can be used to equalize the group delay of recursive filters. This filter is also used in phaser effects. * A Hilbert transformer is a specific all-pass filter that passes sinusoids with unchanged amplitude but shifts each sinusoid phase by ¬±90¬∞. * A fractional delay filter is an all-pass that has a specified and constant group or phase delay for all frequencies. = The impulse response = There is a direct correspondence between the filter's frequency function and its impulse response: the former is the Fourier transform of the latter. That means that any requirement on the frequency function is a requirement on the impulse response, and vice versa. However, in certain applications it may be the filter's impulse response that is explicit and the design process then aims at producing as close an approximation as possible to the requested impulse response given all other requirements. In some cases it may even be relevant to consider a frequency function and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other. For example, we may want both a specific frequency function of the filter and that the resulting filter have a small effective width in the signal domain as possible. The latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired frequency function. The goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible. = Causality = In order to be implementable, any time-dependent filter (operating in real time) must be causal: the filter response only depends on the current and past inputs. A standard approach is to leave this requirement until the final step. If the resulting filter is not causal, it can be made causal by introducing an appropriate time-shift (or delay). If the filter is a part of a larger system (which it normally is) these types of delays have to be introduced with care since they affect the operation of the entire system. Filters that do not operate in real time (e.g. for image processing) can be non-causal. This e.g. allows the design of zero delay recursive filters, where the group delay of a causal filter is canceled by its Hermitian non-causal filter. = Stability = A stable filter assures that every limited input signal produces a limited filter response. A filter which does not meet this requirement may in some situations prove useless or even harmful. Certain design approaches can guarantee stability, for example by using only feed- forward circuits such as an FIR filter. On the other hand, filters based on feedback circuits have other advantages and may therefore be preferred, even if this class of filters includes unstable filters. In this case, the filters must be carefully designed in order to avoid instability. = Locality = In certain applications we have to deal with signals which contain components which can be described as local phenomena, for example pulses or steps, which have certain time duration. A consequence of applying a filter to a signal is, in intuitive terms, that the duration of the local phenomena is extended by the width of the filter. This implies that it is sometimes important to keep the width of the filter's impulse response function as short as possible. According to the uncertainty relation of the Fourier transform, the product of the width of the filter's impulse response function and the width of its frequency function must exceed a certain constant. This means that any requirement on the filter's locality also implies a bound on its frequency function's width. Consequently, it may not be possible to simultaneously meet requirements on the locality of the filter's impulse response function as well as on its frequency function. This is a typical example of contradicting requirements. = Computational complexity = A general desire in any design is that the number of operations (additions and multiplications) needed to compute the filter response is as low as possible. In certain applications, this desire is a strict requirement, for example due to limited computational resources, limited power resources, or limited time. The last limitation is typical in real-time applications. There are several ways in which a filter can have different computational complexity. For example, the order of a filter is more or less proportional to the number of operations. This means that by choosing a low order filter, the computation time can be reduced. For discrete filters the computational complexity is more or less proportional to the number of filter coefficients. If the filter has many coefficients, for example in the case of multidimensional signals such as tomography data, it may be relevant to reduce the number of coefficients by removing those which are sufficiently close to zero. In multirate filters, the number of coefficients by taking advantage of its bandwidth limits, where the input signal is downsampled (e.g. to its critical frequency), and upsampled after filtering. Another issue related to computational complexity is separability, that is, if and how a filter can be written as a convolution of two or more simpler filters. In particular, this issue is of importance for multidimensional filters, e.g., 2D filter which are used in image processing. In this case, a significant reduction in computational complexity can be obtained if the filter can be separated as the convolution of one 1D filter in the horizontal direction and one 1D filter in the vertical direction. A result of the filter design process may, e.g., be to approximate some desired filter as a separable filter or as a sum of separable filters. = Other considerations = It must also be decided how the filter is going to be implemented: * Analog filter * Analog sampled filter * Digital filter * Mechanical filter  Analog filters  The design of linear analog filters is for the most part covered in the linear filter section.  Digital filters  Digital filters are classified into one of two basic forms, according to how they respond to a unit impulse: *Finite impulse response, or FIR, filters express each output sample as a weighted sum of the last N input samples, where N is the order of the filter. FIR filters are normally non- recursive, meaning they do not use feedback and as such are inherently stable. A moving average filter or CIC filter are examples of FIR filters that are normally recursive (that use feedback). If the FIR coefficients are symmetrical (often the case), then such a filter is linear phase, so it delays signals of all frequencies equally which is important in many applications. It is also straightforward to avoid overflow in an FIR filter. The main disadvantage is that they may require significantly more processing and memory resources than cleverly designed IIR variants. FIR filters are generally easier to design than IIR filters - the Parks-McClellan filter design algorithm (based on the Remez algorithm) is one suitable method for designing quite good filters semi-automatically. (See Methodology.) *Infinite impulse response, or IIR, filters are the digital counterpart to analog filters. Such a filter contains internal state, and the output and the next internal state are determined by a linear combination of the previous inputs and outputs (in other words, they use feedback, which FIR filters normally do not). In theory, the impulse response of such a filter never dies out completely, hence the name IIR, though in practice, this is not true given the finite resolution of computer arithmetic. IIR filters normally require less computing resources than an FIR filter of similar performance. However, due to the feedback, high order IIR filters may have problems with instability, arithmetic overflow, and limit cycles, and require careful design to avoid such pitfalls. Additionally, since the phase shift is inherently a non-linear function of frequency, the time delay through such a filter is frequency-dependent, which can be a problem in many situations. 2nd order IIR filters are often called 'biquads' and a common implementation of higher order filters is to cascade biquads. A useful reference for computing biquad coefficients is the RBJ Audio EQ Cookbook.  Sample rate  Unless the sample rate is fixed by some outside constraint, selecting a suitable sample rate is an important design decision. A high rate will require more in terms of computational resources, but less in terms of anti-aliasing filters. Interference and beating with other signals in the system may also be an issue.  Anti-aliasing  For any digital filter design, it is crucial to analyze and avoid aliasing effects. Often, this is done by adding analog anti-aliasing filters at the input and output, thus avoiding any frequency component above the Nyquist frequency. The complexity (i.e., steepness) of such filters depends on the required signal to noise ratio and the ratio between the sampling rate and the highest frequency of the signal.  Theoretical basis  Parts of the design problem relate to the fact that certain requirements are described in the frequency domain while others are expressed in the signal domain and that these may contradict. For example, it is not possible to obtain a filter which has both an arbitrary impulse response and arbitrary frequency function. Other effects which refer to relations between the signal and frequency domain are * The uncertainty principle between the signal and frequency domains * The variance extension theorem * The asymptotic behaviour of one domain versus discontinuities in the other = The uncertainty principle = As stated by the Gabor limit, an uncertainty principle, the product of the width of the frequency function and the width of the impulse response cannot be smaller than a specific constant. This implies that if a specific frequency function is requested, corresponding to a specific frequency width, the minimum width of the filter in the signal domain is set. Vice versa, if the maximum width of the response is given, this determines the smallest possible width in the frequency. This is a typical example of contradictory requirements where the filter design process may try to find a useful compromise. = The variance extension theorem = Let \\\\sigma^{2}_{s} be the variance of the input signal and let \\\\sigma^{2}_{f} be the variance of the filter. The variance of the filter response, \\\\sigma^{2}_{r}, is then given by : \\\\sigma^{2}_{r} = \\\\sigma^{2}_{s} \\\\+ \\\\sigma^{2}_{f} This means that \\\\sigma_{r} > \\\\sigma_{f} and implies that the localization of various features such as pulses or steps in the filter response is limited by the filter width in the signal domain. If a precise localization is requested, we need a filter of small width in the signal domain and, via the uncertainty principle, its width in the frequency domain cannot be arbitrary small. = Discontinuities versus asymptotic behaviour = Let f(t) be a function and let F(\\\\omega) be its Fourier transform. There is a theorem which states that if the first derivative of F which is discontinuous has order n \\\\geq 0, then f has an asymptotic decay like t^{-n-1}. A consequence of this theorem is that the frequency function of a filter should be as smooth as possible to allow its impulse response to have a fast decay, and thereby a short width.  Methodology  One common method for designing FIR filters is the Parks-McClellan filter design algorithm, based on the Remez exchange algorithm. Here the user specifies a desired frequency response, a weighting function for errors from this response, and a filter order N. The algorithm then finds the set of N coefficients that minimize the maximum deviation from the ideal. Intuitively, this finds the filter that is as close as you can get to the desired response given that you can use only N coefficients. This method is particularly easy in practice and at least one textRabiner, Lawrence R., and Gold, Bernard, 1975: Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc.) includes a program that takes the desired filter and N and returns the optimum coefficients. One possible drawback to filters designed this way is that they contain many small ripples in the passband(s), since such a filter minimizes the peak error. Another method to finding a discrete FIR filter is filter optimization described in Knutsson et al., which minimizes the integral of the square of the error, instead of its maximum value. In its basic form this approach requires that an ideal frequency function of the filter F_{I}(\\\\omega) is specified together with a frequency weighting function W(\\\\omega) and set of coordinates x_{k} in the signal domain where the filter coefficients are located. An error function \\\\varepsilon is defined as :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\ W \\\\cdot (F_{I} - \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\\\\\{ f \\\\\\\\}) \\\\^{2} where f(x) is the discrete filter and \\\\mathcal{F} is the discrete-time Fourier transform defined on the specified set of coordinates. The norm used here is, formally, the usual norm on L^{2} spaces. This means that \\\\varepsilon measures the deviation between the requested frequency function of the filter, F_{I}, and the actual frequency function of the realized filter, \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\\\\\{ f \\\\\\\\}. However, the deviation is also subject to the weighting function W before the error function is computed. Once the error function is established, the optimal filter is given by the coefficients f(x) which minimize \\\\varepsilon. This can be done by solving the corresponding least squares problem. In practice, the L^{2} norm has to be approximated by means of a suitable sum over discrete points in the frequency domain. In general, however, these points should be significantly more than the number of coefficients in the signal domain to obtain a useful approximation. = Simultaneous optimization in both domains = The previous method can be extended to include an additional error term related to a desired filter impulse response in the signal domain, with a corresponding weighting function. The ideal impulse response can be chosen independently of the ideal frequency function and is in practice used to limit the effective width and to remove ringing effects of the resulting filter in the signal domain. This is done by choosing a narrow ideal filter impulse response function, e.g., an impulse, and a weighting function which grows fast with the distance from the origin, e.g., the distance squared. The optimal filter can still be calculated by solving a simple least squares problem and the resulting filter is then a \\"compromise\\" which has a total optimal fit to the ideal functions in both domains. An important parameter is the relative strength of the two weighting functions which determines in which domain it is more important to have a good fit relative to the ideal function.

Biography Born of very humble parents at Laon before the middle of the 11th century, he is said to have studied under Saint Anselm at Bec, though this is almost certainly incorrect. Other potential teachers of Anselm have been identified, including Bruno of Cologne and Manegold of Lautenbach. By around 1080, he had moved back to his place of birth and was teaching at the cathedral school of Laon, with his brother Ralph. Around 1109, he became dean and chancellor of the cathedral, and in 1115 he was one of Laon's two archdeacons. His school for theology and exegesis rapidly became the most well known in Europe. Famously, in 1113, he expelled Peter Abelard from his school. The Liber Pancrisi () names him, with his brother Ralph, Ivo of Chartres, and William of Champeaux, as one of the four modern masters.  Works  Systematic Sentences attributed to St. Anselm of Laon.The Rebdorf Psalter: Book of Psalms with Gloss by Anselm of Laon. Anselm's greatest work, an interlinear and marginal gloss on the 'Scriptures', the Glossa ordinaria, now attributed to him and his followers, was one of the great intellectual achievements of the Middle Ages. It has been frequently reprinted. The significance of the gloss, which was most likely assembled after Anselm's death by his students, such as Gilbert de la Porr√©e, and based on Anselm's teaching, is that it marked a new way of learning ‚Äî it represented the birth of efforts to present discrete patristic and earlier medieval interpretations of individual verses of Scripture in a readily accessible, easily referenced way. This theme was subsequently adopted and extended by the likes of Hugh of St. Victor, Peter Lombard and later Thomas Aquinas, who gave us 'handbooks' for what we would now call theology. Other commentaries apparently by Anselm have been ascribed to various writers, principally to Anselm of Canterbury. The works are collected in Migne.. Some of his Sententiae were edited at Milan by G. Lefevre in 1894.. The commentary on the Psalms attributed to Haymo of Halberstadt by MignePL, Vol. CXVI. has also been identified as possibly being the work of Anselm.

When the famous geographer Ibn Battuta arrived in Khurasan in 1333, he traveled across the country but did not record any place by the name of Hazarajat. Etymology and usage The Hazara people and surrounding peoples use the names Hazarajat or Hazaristan to identify the historic Hazara lands. Hazarajat is a compound of Hazara and the Dari suffix jat, which is used to make words associated with land in south, central and west Asia. The Arab geographer Maqdesi ( 945/946 ‚Äì 991) named Hazarajat as Gharjistan or Gharj Al-Shar (Gharj meaning \\"mountain\\") area ruled by chiefs.·∏§amd-Allah Mostawfi, Nozhat al-qolub, tr.

Geography  A popular route through the mountains of Bamyan =Topography= Bamyan Province of Afghanistan The Hazarajat lies in the central highlands of Afghanistan, among the Koh-i Baba mountains and the western extremities of the Hindu Kush. Its boundaries have historically been inexact and shifting. Its physical boundaries, however, are roughly marked by the BƒÅ-miƒÅn Basin (see BƒÄMIƒÄN ii.) to the north, the headwaters of the Helmand River (q.v.) to the south, Firuzkuh to the west, and the Unai Pass to the east. The regional terrain is very mountainous and extends to the Safid Kuh and the SiƒÅh Kuh mountains, where the highest peaks are between 15,000 to 17,000 feet. Both sides of the Kuh-e BƒÅbƒÅ range contain a succession of valleys. The north face of the range descends steeply, merging into low foothills and short semi-arid plains, while the south face stretches towards the Helmand Valley and the mountainous district of Behsud.Wilfred Thesiger \\"The Hazaras of Central Afghanistan,\\" The Geographical Journal 71/3, 1955, pp. 313 The northeastern part of the Hazarajat, is the site of ancient Bamyan, a center of Buddhism and a key caravanserai on the Silk Road. The town is situated at a height of 7,500 feet and surrounded by the Hindu Kush to the north and Koh-i Baba to the south. =Climate= Hazarajat is mountainous,Anonymous, ·∏§odud al- øƒÅlam, tr.

The area was ruled successively by the Achaemenids, Seleucids, Mauryas, Kushans, and Hephthalites before the Saffarids Islamized it and made it part of their empire. It was taken over by the Samanids, followed by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids before falling to the Delhi Sultanate. In the 13th century, it was invaded by Genghis Khan and his Mongol. In the following decades the Qarlughids emerged to create and ived local dynasty that offered a few decades of self-rule. Later, the area became part of the Timurid dynasty, the Mughal Empire and the Durrani Empire. The subjugation of the Hazarajat, particularly the mountain fortresses of Bamyan, proved difficult for the invaders at their conquest of the region. \\"adopted the language of the vanquished\\".W.

Yate, who surveyed the tracts between Herat and the Oxus, visited the Qala-e Naw Pashtuns in the Paropamisus mountain range, to the east of the Jamshidis of Kushk.

Caught between the strategic interests of foreign powers and disappointed by the demarcation of the Durand Line in southern Afghanistan, which cut into Pashtun territory, he set out to bring the northern peripheries of the country more firmly under his control. This policy had disastrous consequences for the Hazarajat, whose inhabitants were singled out by Abdur Rahman Khan's regime.Mir Munshi, ed., The Life of Abdur Rahman, Amir of Afghanistan, II, London, 1900, p. 276 =20th and 21st century= Two farmers tend to a potato field near the town of Bamyan In the 1920s the ancient Shibar Pass road which leads through Bamyan and east to the Panjshir Valley was paved for lorries, and it remained the busiest road across the Hindu Kush until the building of the Salang tunnel in 1964 and the opening of a winter route. Hazaras migrated to cities and to surrounding countries, where they became laborers and undertook the hardest and lowest-paid work. In 1979, there were reportedly less than half million Hazaras in the Hazarajat and Kabul. Barnett Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, New Haven, 2002, p. 26 As the Afghan state weakened, uprisings broke out in the Hazarajat, freeing the region from state rule by the summer of 1979 for the first time since the death of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan some Hazara resistance groups were formed in Iran, including Nasr and Sipah-i Pasdaran, with some being \\"committed to the idea of a separate Hazara national identity\\". Barnett Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, New Haven, 2002. pp. 186, 191, 223 During the war with the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, most of the Hazarajat was unoccupied and free of Soviet or state presence. The region became ruled once again by local leaders, or mirs, and a new stratum of young radical Shi øi commanders. Economic conditions are reported to have decreased in the Hazarajat during the war. Barnett Rubin, The Fragmentation of Afghanistan, New Haven, 2002, p. 246 The group ruling Hazarajat was the Revolutionary Council of Islamic Unity of Afghanistan or Shura-i Ettefaq, led by Sayyid Ali Beheshti, who created a de facto proto-state. The region's geographic nature and un-strategic location meant that the government and Soviets ignored it as they fought rebels elsewhere. This effectively allowed the Shura-i Ettefaq administration to rule over the region and give autonomy to the Hazaras. Their politically opposing groups were the pro-Iran Nasr and the Khans, who were mostly educated, secular and left-wing.Nation, Ethnicity and the Conflict in Afghanistan: Political Islam and the rise of ethno-politics 1992‚Äì1996 by Raghav Sharma, 2016. The Shura wanted a return to the 19th century status quo whiereas the Nasr wanted an Iranian-style government of clerics. Between 1982 and 1984, an internal civil war caused the Shura to be overthrown by the Sazman-i Nasr and Sepah-i Pasdaran groups. However inter-factional rivalry continued thereafter. Most of the Hazara groups united in 1987 and in 1989 formed the Hizb-i-Wahdat. During the rule of Taliban, once again violence struck Hazarajat. In 1997, a revolt broke out among Hazara people in Mazar-i- Sharif when refused to be disarmed by Taliban; 600 Taliban were killed in subsequent fighting.Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil, and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, London and New Haven, 2000, p. 58 In retaliation, the genocidal policies of Amir Abdur Rahman Khan's era was adopted by Taliban. In 1998, six hundred Hazaras were killed in the north; the intention was ethnic cleansing of Hazara.Ahmed Rashid, Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil, and Fundamentalism in Central Asia, London and New Haven, 2000, pp. 67‚Äì74 At that stage, Hazarajat did not exist as an official region; the area was divided between the administrative provinces of Bamyan, Ghor, Wardak, Ghazni, Oruzgan, Juzjan, and Samangan.

Its aim was to secure Indian independence from British rule. It fought alongside Japanese soldiers in the latter's campaign in the Southeast Asian theatre of WWII. The army was first formed in 1942 under Mohan Singh, by Indian PoWs of the British-Indian Army captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and at Singapore. This first INA collapsed and was disbanded in December that year after differences between the INA leadership and the Japanese military over its role in Japan's war in Asia. Rash Behari Bose handed over INA to Subhas Chandra Bose. It was revived under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose after his arrival in Southeast Asia in 1943. The army was declared to be the army of Bose's Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind (the Provisional Government of Free India). Under Bose's leadership, the INA drew ex-prisoners and thousands of civilian volunteers from the Indian expatriate population in Malaya (present-day Malaysia) and Burma. This second INA fought along with the Imperial Japanese Army against the British and Commonwealth forces in the campaigns in Burma: at Imphal and Kohima, and later against the Allied retaking of Burma. After the INA's initial formation in 1942, there was concern in the British-Indian Army that further Indian troops would defect. This led to a reporting ban and a propaganda campaign called \\"Jiffs\\" to preserve the loyalty of the Sepoy. Historians like Peter W. Fay who have written about the army, however, consider the INA not to have had significant influence on the war. The end of the war saw many of the troops repatriated to India where some faced trials for treason. These trials became a galvanising point in the Indian Independence movement. The Bombay mutiny in the Royal Indian Navy and other mutinies in 1946 are thought to have been caused by the nationalist feelings that were caused by the INA trials. Historians like Sumit Sarkar, Peter Cohen, Fay and others suggest that these events played a crucial role in hastening the end of British rule. A number of people associated with the INA during the war later went on to hold important roles in public life in India as well as in other countries in Southeast Asia, most notably Lakshmi Sehgal in India, and John Thivy and Janaki Athinahappan in Malaya. It was associated with Imperial Japan and the other Axis powers, and accusations were levelled against INA troops of being involved and complicit in Japanese war crimes. The INA's members were viewed as Axis collaborators by British soldiers and Indian PoWs who did not join the army, but after the war they were seen as patriots by many Indians. Although they were widely commemorated by the Indian National Congress in the immediate aftermath of Indian independence, members of the INA were denied freedom fighter status by the Government of India, unlike those in the Gandhian movement. Nevertheless, the army remains a popular and passionate topic in Indian culture and politics. First INA Major Iwaichi Fujiwara greets Mohan Singh. Circa April 1942. Before the start of World War II, Japan and South-East Asia were major refuges for exiled Indian nationalists. Meanwhile, Japan had sent intelligence missions, notably under Maj. Iwaichi Fujiwara, into South Asia to gather support from the Malayan sultans, overseas Chinese, the Burmese resistance and the Indian independence movement. The Minami Kikan successfully recruited Burmese nationalists, while the F Kikan was successful in establishing contacts with Indian nationalists in exile in Thailand and Malaya. Fujiwara, later self-described as \\"Lawrence of the Indian National Army\\" (after Lawrence of Arabia) is said to have been a man committed to the values which his office was supposed to convey to the expatriate nationalist leaders, and found acceptance among them. His initial contact was with Giani Pritam Singh and the Thai-Bharat Cultural Lodge. At the outbreak of World War II in South-East Asia, 70,000 Indian troops (mostly Sikhs) were stationed in Malaya. In Japan's spectacular Malayan Campaign many Indian prisoners-of-war were captured, including nearly 45,000 after the fall of Singapore alone. The conditions of service within the British-Indian Army and the social conditions in Malaya had led to dissension among these troops. From these prisoners, the First Indian National Army was formed under Mohan Singh. Singh was an officer in the British-Indian Army who was captured early in the Malayan campaign. His nationalist sympathies found an ally in Fujiwara and he received considerable Japanese aid and support. Ethnic Indians in Southeast Asia also supported the cause of Indian independence and had formed local leagues in Malaya before the war. These came together with encouragement from Japan after the occupation, forming the Indian Independence League (IIL). Although there were a number of prominent local Indians working in the IIL, the overall leadership came to rest with Rash Behari Bose, an Indian revolutionary who had lived in self- exile in Japan since World War I. The League and INA leadership decided that the INA was to be subordinate to the IIL. A working council ‚Äì composed of prominent members of the League and the INA leaders ‚Äì was to decide on decisions to send the INA to war. The Indian leaders feared that they would appear to be Japanese puppets, so a decision was taken that the INA would go to battle only when the Indian National Congress called it to do so. Assurances of non-interference‚Äî later termed the Bidadary resolutions‚Äî were demanded of Japan; these would have amounted to a treaty with an independent government. In this time, F. Kikan had been replaced by the Iwakuro Kikan (or I Kikan) headed by Hideo Iwakuro. Iwakuro's working relationship with the league was more tenuous. Japan did not immediately agree to the demands arising from the Bidadary resolutions. Differences also existed between Rash Behari and the League, not least because Rash Behari had lived in Japan for the considerable time and had a Japanese wife and a son in the Imperial Japanese Army. On the other hand, Mohan Singh expected military strategy and decisions to be autonomous decisions for the INA, independent of the league. In November and December 1942, concern about Japan's intentions towards the INA led to disagreement between the INA and the League on the one hand and the Japanese on the other. The INA leadership resigned along with that of the League (except Rash Behari). The unit was dissolved by Mohan Singh in December 1942, and he ordered the troops of the INA to return to PoW camps. Mohan Singh was expected to be shot. Between December 1942 and February 1943, Rash Behari struggled to hold the INA together. On 15 February 1943, the army itself was put under the command of Lt. Col. M.Z. Kiani. A policy forming body was formed with Lt. Col J.R. Bhonsle (Director of the Military Bureau) in charge and clearly placed under the authority of the IIL. Under Bhonsle served Lt. Col. Shah Nawaz Khan as Chief of General Staff, Major P.K. Sahgal as Military Secretary, Major Habib ur Rahman as commandant of the Officers' Training School and Lt. Col. A.C. Chatterji (later Major A.D. Jahangir) as head of enlightenment and culture. Second INA =Subhas Chandra Bose= Subhas Chandra Bose was the ideal person to lead a rebel army into India came from the very beginning of F Kikan's work with captured Indian soldiers. Mohan Singh himself, soon after his first meeting with Fujiwara, had suggested that Bose was the right leader of a nationalist Indian army. A number of the officers and troops ‚Äì including some who now returned to prisoner-of-war camps and some who had not volunteered in the first place ‚Äì made it known that they would be willing to join the INA only if it was led by Subhas Bose. Bose was a nationalist. He had joined the Gandhian movement after resigning from a prestigious post in the Indian Civil Service in 1922, quickly rising in the Congress and being incarcerated repeatedly by the Raj. By late 1920s he and Nehru were considered the future leaders of the Congress. In the late 1920s, he was amongst the first Congress leaders to call for complete independence from Britain (Purna Swaraj), rather than the previous Congress objective of India becoming a British dominion. In Bengal, he was repeatedly accused by Raj officials of working with the revolutionary movement. Under his leadership, the Congress youth group in Bengal was organised into a quasi-military organisation called the Bengal Volunteers. Bose deplored Gandhi's pacifism; Gandhi disagreed with Bose's confrontations with the Raj. The Congress's working committee, including Nehru, was predominantly loyal to Gandhi. While openly disagreeing with Gandhi, Bose won the presidency of Indian National Congress twice in the 1930s. His second victory came despite opposition from Gandhi. He defeated Gandhi's favoured candidate, Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya, in the popular vote, but the entire working committee resigned and refused to work with Bose. Bose resigned from the Congress presidency and founded his own faction, the All India Forward Bloc. At the start of World War II, Bose was placed under house arrest by the Raj. He escaped in disguise and made his way through Afghanistan and Central -Asia. He came first to the Soviet Union and then to Germany, reaching Berlin on 2 April 1941. There he -sought to raise an army of Indian soldiers from prisoners of war captured by Germany, forming the Free India Legion and the Azad Hind Radio. The Japanese ambassador, Oshima Hiroshi, kept Tokyo informed of these developments. From the very start of the war, the Japanese intelligence services noted from speaking to captured Indian soldiers that Bose was held in extremely high regard as a nationalist and was considered by Indian soldiers to be the right person to be leading a rebel army. In a series of meetings between the INA leaders and the Japanese in 1943, it was decided to cede the leadership of the IIL and the INA to Bose. In January 1943, the Japanese invited Bose to lead the Indian nationalist movement in East Asia. He accepted and left Germany on 8 February. After a three-month journey by submarine and a short stop in Singapore, he reached Tokyo on 11 May 1943. In Tokyo, he met Hideki Tojo, the Japanese prime minister, and the Japanese High Command. He then arrived in Singapore in July 1943, where he made a number of radio broadcasts to Indians in Southeast Asia exhorting them to join in the fight for India's independence. =Revival= On 4 July 1943 two days after reaching Singapore, Bose assumed the leadership of the IIL and the Indian National Army in a ceremony at Cathay Building. Bose's influence was notable. His appeal re- invigorated the INA, which had previously consisted mainly of prisoners of war: it also attracted Indian expatriates in South Asia. He famously proclaimed that Give me blood! I will give you freedom \\"Local civilians joined the INA, doubling its strength. They included barristers, traders and plantation workers, as well as Khudabadi Sindhi Swarankars who were working as shop keepers; many had no military experience.\\" Carl Vadivella Belle estimates under Bose's dynamic appeal, membership of the IIL peaked at 350,000, while almost 100,000 local Indians in South-east Asia volunteered to join the INA, with the army ultimately reaching a force of 50,000. Hugh Toye‚Äî a British Intelligence officer and author of a 1959 history of the army called The Springing Tiger‚Äî and American historian Peter Fay (author of a 1993 history called The Forgotten Army) have reached similar estimates of troop strength. The first INA is considered to have comprised about 40,000 troops, of whom about 4,000 withdrew when it was disbanded in December 1942. The Second INA started with 12,000 troops. Further recruitment of former Indian Army personnel added about 8,000‚Äì10,000. About 18,000 Indian civilians also enlisted during this time. Belle estimates almost 20,000 were local Malayan Indians, while another 20,000 were ex-British-Indian Army members who volunteered for the INA. Subhas Bose with Mohandas Gandhi at a Congress meeting, c 1930 The exact organisation of the INA and its precise troop strength is not known, since its records were destroyed by the withdrawing Azad Hind Government before Rangoon was recaptured by Commonwealth forces in 1945. The order of battle described by Fay (constructed from discussions with INA-veterans), nonetheless, is similar to that described of the first INA by Toye in The Springing Tiger. The 1st Division, under M.Z. Kiani, drew many ex- Indian army prisoners of war who had joined Mohan Singh's first INA. It also drew prisoners of war who had not joined in 1942. It consisted of the 2nd Guerrilla Regiment (the Gandhi Brigade) consisting of two battalions under Col. Inayat Kiani; the 3rd Guerrilla Regiment (the Azad Brigade) with three battalions under Col. Gulzara Singh; and the 4th Guerrilla Regiment (or Nehru Brigade) commanded by the end of the war by Lt. Col Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon. The 1st Guerrilla Regiment ‚Äì the Subhas Brigade ‚Äì under Col. Shah Nawaz Khan was an independent unit, consisting of three infantry battalions. A special operations group was also to be set up called the Bahadur group (Valiant), to operate behind enemy lines. A training school for INA officers, led by Habib ur Rahman, and the Azad School for the civilian volunteers were set up to provide training to the recruits. A youth wing of the INA, composed of 45 young Indians personally chosen by Bose and known as the Tokyo Boys, was also sent to Japan's Imperial Military Academy, where its members trained as fighter pilots. A separate all-female unit was also created under Lakshmi Sahgal. This unit was intended to have combat-commitments. Named Jhansi ki Rani (\\"Jhansi Queens\\") Regiment (after the legendary rebel Queen Lakshmibai of the 1857 rebellion), it drew female civilian volunteers from Malaya and Burma. The 1st Division was lightly armed. Each battalion was composed of five companies of infantry. The individual companies were armed with six antitank rifles, six Bren guns and six Vickers machine guns. Some NCOs carried hand grenades, while senior officers of the Bahadur groups attached to each unit issued hand grenades (of captured British stock) to men going forward on duty. The 2nd Division was organised under Colonel Abdul Aziz Tajik It was formed largely after the Imphal offensive had started and drew large remnants of what remained of the Hindustan Field Force of the First INA. The 2nd Division consisted of the 1st Infantry Regiment, which later merged with the 5th Guerrilla Regiment to form the INA's 2nd Infantry Regiment under Col Prem Sahgal. The 1st Infantry Regiment drew many civilian volunteers from Burma and Malaya and was equipped with the largest share of the heavy armament that the INA possessed. An additional 3rd Division of the INA was composed chiefly of local volunteers in Malaya and Singapore. This unit disbanded before Japan surrendered. A motor transport division was also created, but it was severely limited by lack of resources. In 1945, at the end of the INA, it consisted of about 40,000 soldiers. Unlike Mohan Singh, whose assumption of the rank of general had generated opposition, Bose refused to take a rank. Both the soldiers of the INA and civilians addressed Bose as Netaji (\\"Dear leader\\"), a term first used in Berlin by members of the Free India Legion. In October 1943, Bose proclaimed the formation of the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind, or the Provisional Government of Free India (also known as Azad Hind or Free India). The INA was declared to be the army of Azad Hind. Operations On 23 October 1943, Azad Hind declared war against Britain and the United States. Its first formal commitment came with the opening of the Japanese offensive towards Manipur, code-named U-Go. In the initial plans for invasion of India, Field Marshall Terauschi had been reluctant to confer any responsibilities to the INA beyond espionage and propaganda. Bose rejected this as the role of Fifth-columnists, and insisted that INA should contribute substantially in troops to form a distinct identity of an Indian-liberation army. He secured from Japanese army Chief of Staff, General Sugiyama, the agreement that INA would rank as an allied army in the offensive. The advanced headquarters of Azad Hind was moved to Rangoon in anticipation of success. The INA's own strategy was to avoid set-piece battles, for which it lacked armament as well as manpower. Initially it sought to obtain arms and increase its ranks by inducing British-Indian soldiers to defect. The latter were expected to defect in large numbers. Col Prem Sahgal, once military secretary to Subhas Bose and later tried in the first Red Fort trials, explained the INA strategy to Peter Fay ‚Äì although the war itself hung in balance and nobody was sure if the Japanese would win, initiating a popular revolution with grass-roots support within India would ensure that even if Japan ultimately lost the war, Britain would not be in a position to re-assert its colonial authority. It was planned that, once Japanese forces had broken through British defences at Imphal, the INA would cross the hills of North-East India into the Gangetic plain, where it would work as a guerrilla army. This army was expected to live off the land, with captured British supplies, support, and personnel from the local population. =1944= Radio transmitting set seized from INA agents in Calcutta, 1944. Four agents had been landed by submarine on the Indian coast, tasked with setting up a wireless post. The plans chosen by Bose and Masakazu Kawabe, chief of the Burma area army, envisaged the INA being assigned an independent sector in the U-Go offensive. No INA units were to operate at less than battalion strength. For operational purposes, the Subhas Brigade was placed under the command of the Japanese General Headquarters in Burma. Advance parties of the Bahadur Group also went forward with advanced Japanese units. As the offensive opened, the INA's 1st Division, consisting of four guerrilla regiments, was divided between U Go and the diversionary Ha-Go offensive in Arakan. One battalion reached as far as Mowdok in Chittagong after breaking through the British West African Division. A Bahadur Group unit, led by Col. Shaukat Malik, took the border enclave of Moirang in early April. The main body of the 1st Division was however committed to the U-Go, directed towards Manipur. Led by Shah Nawaz Khan, it successfully protected the Japanese flanks against Chin and Kashin guerrillas as Renya Mutaguchi's three divisions crossed the Chindwin river and the Naga Hills, and participated in the main offensive through Tamu in the direction of Imphal and Kohima. The 2nd Division, under M.Z. Kiani, was placed to the right flank of the 33rd Division attacking Kohima. However, by the time Khan's forces left Tamu, the offensive had been held, and Khan's troops were redirected to Kohima. After reaching Ukhrul, near Kohima, they found Japanese forces had begun their withdrawal from the area. The INA's forces suffered the same fate as Mutaguchi's army when the siege of Imphal was broken. With little or nothing in the way of supplies, and with additional difficulties caused by the monsoon, Allied air dominance, and Burmese irregular forces, the 1st and 2nd divisions began withdrawing alongside the 15th Army and Burma Area Army. During the withdrawal through Manipur, a weakened Gandhi regiment held its position against the advancing Maratha Light Infantry on the Burma‚ÄìIndia road while the general withdrawal was prepared. The 2nd and 3rd INA regiments protected the flanks of the Yamamoto force successfully at the most critical time during this withdrawal, but wounded and diseased men succumbed to starvation along the route. Commonwealth troops following the Japanese forces found INA dead along with Japanese troops who had died of starvation. The INA lost a substantial number of men and amount of materiel in this retreat. A number of units were disbanded or used to feed into new divisions. =1945= As the Allied Burma campaign began the following year, the INA remained committed to the defence of Burma and was a part of the Japanese defensive deployments. The Second Division was tasked with the defence of Irrawaddy and the adjoining areas around Nangyu, and offered opposition to Messervy's 7th Indian Division when it attempted to cross the river at Pagan and Nyangyu during Irrawaddy operations. Later, during the Battles of Meiktila and Mandalay, the forces under Prem Sahgal were tasked with defending the area around Mount Popa from the British 17th Division, which would have exposed the flank of Heitar≈ç Kimura's forces attempting to retake Meiktila and Nyangyu. The division was obliterated, at times fighting tanks with hand grenades and bottles of petrol. Many INA soldiers realised that they were in a hopeless position. Many surrendered to pursuing Commonwealth forces. Isolated, losing men to exhaustion and to desertion, low on ammunition and food, and pursued by Commonwealth forces, the surviving units of the second division began an attempt to withdraw towards Rangoon. They broke through encircling Commonwealth lines a number of times before finally surrendering at various places in early April 1945. As the Japanese situation became precarious, the Azad Hind government withdrew from Rangoon to Singapore, along with the remnants of the 1st Division and the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. Nearly 6,000 troops of the surviving units of the INA remained in Rangoon under A. D. Loganathan. They surrendered as Rangoon fell and helped keep order until the Allied forces entered the city. As the Japanese withdrawal from Burma progressed, other remnants of the INA began a long march overland and on foot towards Bangkok. In what has been called an \\"epic retreat to safety\\", Bose walked with his troops, refusing to leave them despite Japanese soldiers finding him transport. The withdrawing forces regularly suffered casualties from Allied planes strafing them and in clashes with Aung San's Burmese resistance, as well as from Chinese guerrillas who harassed the Japanese troops. Bose returned to Singapore in August to what remained of the INA and Azad Hind. He wished to stay with his government in Singapore to surrender to the British, reasoning that a trial in India and possible execution would ignite the country, serving the independence movement. He was convinced not to do so by the Azad Hind cabinet. At the time of Japan's surrender in September 1945, Bose left for Dalian near the Soviet border in Japanese-occupied China to attempt to contact the advancing Soviet troops, and was reported to have died in an air crash near Taiwan. The remaining INA troops surrendered under the command of M.Z. Kiani to British-Indian forces at Singapore. End of the INA =Repatriation to India= Troops of the Indian National Army who surrendered at Mount Popa. Circa April 1945. Even before the end of the war in South Asia, the INA prisoners who were falling into Allied hands were being evaluated by forwarding intelligence units for potential trials. Almost fifteen hundred had been captured in the battles of Imphal and Kohima and the subsequent withdrawal, while larger numbers surrendered or were captured during the 14th Army's Burma Campaign. A total of 16,000 of the INA's 43,000 recruits were captured, of whom around 11,000 were interrogated by the Combined Services Directorate of Investigation Corps (CSDIC). The number of prisoners necessitated this selective policy which anticipated trials of those with the strongest commitment to Bose's ideologies. Those with lesser commitment or other extenuating circumstances would be dealt with more leniently, with the punishment proportional to their commitment or war crimes. For this purpose, the field intelligence units designated the captured troops as Blacks with the strongest commitment to Azad Hind; Greys with varying commitment but also with enticing circumstances that led them to join the INA; and Whites, those who were pressured into joining the INA under the circumstances but with no commitment to Azad Hind, INA, or Bose. By July 1945, a large number had been shipped back to India. At the time of the fall of Japan, the remaining captured troops were transported to India via Rangoon. Large numbers of local Malay and Burmese volunteers, including the recruits to the Rani of Jhansi regiment, returned to civilian life and were not identified. Those repatriated passed through transit camps in Chittagong and Calcutta to be held at detention camps all over India including Jhingergacha and Nilganj near Calcutta, Kirkee outside Pune, Attock, Multan and at Bahadurgarh near Delhi. Bahadurgarh also held prisoners of the Free India Legion. By November, around 12,000 INA prisoners were held in these camps; they were released according to the \\"colours\\". By December, around 600 Whites were released per week. The process to select those to face trial started. The British-Indian Army intended to implement appropriate internal disciplinary action against its soldiers who had joined the INA, whilst putting to trial a selected group in order to preserve discipline in the Indian Army and to award punishment for criminal acts where these had occurred. As news of the army spread within India, it began to draw widespread sympathy support and admiration from Indians. Newspaper reports around November 1945 reported executions of INA troops, which worsened the already volatile situation. Increasingly violent confrontations broke out between the police and protesters at the mass rallies being held all over India, culminating in public riotings in support of the INA men. This public outcry defied traditional communal barriers of the subcontinent, representing a departure from the divisions between Hindus and Muslims seen elsewhere in the independence movement and campaign for Pakistan. =Red Fort trials= Between November 1945 and May 1946, approximately ten courts-martial were held in public at the Red Fort in Delhi. Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British-Indian army, hoped that by holding public trials in the Red Fort, public opinion would turn against the INA if the media reported stories of torture and collaborationism, helping him settle a political as well as military question. Those to stand trials were accused variously of murder, torture and \\"waging war against the King-Emperor\\". However, the first and most celebrated joint courts-martial ‚Äì those of Prem Sahgal, Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan ‚Äì were not the story of torture and murder Auchinleck had hoped to tell the Indian press and people. The accusations against them included the alleged murder of their comrades-in-arms in the INA whilst in Burma. Peter Fay highlights in his book The Forgotten Army that the murders alleged were, in fact, courts-martial of captured deserters the defendants had presided over. If it was accepted that the three were part of a genuine combatant army (as the legal defence team later argued), they had followed due process of written INA law and of the normal process of conduct of war in execution of the sentences. Indians rapidly came to view the soldiers who enlisted as patriots and not enemy-collaborators. Philip Mason, then-Secretary of the War Department, later wrote that \\"in a matter of weeks ... in a wave of nationalist emotion, the INA were acclaimed heroes who fought for the freedom of India.\\" The three accused were from the three major religions of India: Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism. Indians felt the INA represented a true, secular, national army when judged against the British- Indian Army, where caste and religious differences were preserved amongst ranks. The opening of the first trial saw violence and a series of riots in a scale later described as \\"sensational\\". The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League both made the release of the INA prisoners an important political issue during the campaign for independence in 1945‚Äì1946. Lahore in Diwali 1946 remained dark as the traditional earthen lamps lit on Diwali were not lit by families in support of prisoners. In addition to civilian campaigns of non-cooperation and non-violent protest, protest spread to include mutinies within the British-Indian Army and sympathy within the British-Indian forces. Support for the INA crossed communal barriers to the extent that it was the last major campaign in which the Congress and the Muslim League aligned together; the Congress tricolour and the green flag of the League were flown together at protests. The Congress quickly came forward to defend soldiers of the INA who were to be court-martialled. The INA Defence Committee was formed by the Indian Congress and included prominent Indian legal figures, among whom were Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai, Kailashnath Katju and Asaf Ali. The trials covered arguments based on military law, constitutional law, international law, and politics. Much of the initial defence was based on the argument that they should be treated as prisoners of war as they were not paid mercenaries but bona fide soldiers of a legal government ‚Äì Bose's Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind. Nehru argued that \\"however misinformed or otherwise they had been in their notion of patriotic duty towards their country\\", they recognized the free Indian state as their sovereign and not the British sovereign. Peter Fay points out that at least one INA prisoner ‚Äì Burhan-ud-Din a brother of the ruler of Chitral ‚Äì may have deserved to be accused of torture, but his trial had been deferred on administrative grounds. Those charged after the first celebrated courts-martial only faced trial for torture and murder or abetment of murder. Charges of treason were dropped for fear of inflaming public opinion. In spite of aggressive and widespread opposition to the continuation of the court-martial, it was completed. All three defendants were found guilty in many of the charges and sentenced to deportation for life. The sentence, however, was never carried out. Immense public pressure, demonstrations, and riots forced Claude Auchinleck to release all three defendants. Within three months, 11,000 soldiers of the INA were released after cashiering and forfeiture of pay and allowance. On the recommendation of Lord Mountbatten and with the agreement of Jawaharlal Nehru, former soldiers of the INA were not allowed to join the new Indian Armed Forces as a condition for independence. Post 1947 Within India, the INA continues to be an emotive and celebrated subject of discussion. It continued to have a stronghold over the public psyche and the sentiments of the armed forces until as late as 1947. It has been suggested that Shah Nawaz Khan was tasked with organising INA troops to train Congress volunteers at Jawaharlal Nehru's request in late 1946 and early 1947. After 1947, several members of the INA who were closely associated with Subhas Bose and with the INA trials were prominent in public life. A number of them held important positions in independent India, serving as ambassadors immediately after independence: Abid Hasan in Egypt and Denmark, A. C. N. Nambiar in the Federal Republic of Germany, Mehboob Hasan in Canada, Cyril John Stracey in the Netherlands, and N. Raghavan in Switzerland. Mohan Singh was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. He worked for the recognition of the members of Indian National Army as \\"freedom fighters\\" in the cause of the nation's independence in and out of Parliament. Shah Nawaz Khan served as Minister of State for Rail in the first Indian cabinet. Lakshmi Sahgal, Minister for Women's Affairs in the Azad Hind government, was a well known and widely respected public figure in India. In 1971, she joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and was later elected the leader of the All India Democratic Women's Association. Joyce Lebra, an American historian, wrote that the rejuvenation of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, then a fledgling Tamil political party in southern India, would not have been possible without participation of INA members. Lakshmi Sahgal in later life, at a political meeting in India Some accounts suggest that the INA veterans were involved in training civilian resistance forces against the Nizam's Razakars prior to the execution of Operation Polo and annexation of Hyderabad. There are also suggestions that some INA veterans led Pakistani irregulars during the First Kashmir war. Mohammed Zaman Kiani served as Pakistan's political agent to Gilgit in the late 1950s. Of the very few ex-INA members who joined the Indian Armed Forces after 1947 R. S. Benegal, a member of the Tokyo Boys, joined the Indian Air Force in 1952 and later rose to be an air commodore. Benegal saw action in both 1965 and Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, earning a Maha Vir Chakra, India's second-highest award for valour. Among other prominent members of the INA, Ram Singh Thakur, composer of a number of songs including the INA's regimental march Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja, has been credited by some for the modern tune of the Indian national anthem. Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Lakshmi Sahgal were later awarded the Indian civilian honours of Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan respectively by the Indian Government in the 1990s. Lakshmi Sahgal was nominated for the Indian presidential election by communist parties in 2002. She was the sole opponent of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, who emerged victorious. Subhas Bose himself was posthumously awarded Bharat Ratna in 1992, but this was later withdrawn over the controversy over the circumstances of his death. Former INA recruits in diasporic Singapore, however, faced a different situation. In Singapore, Indians ‚Äì particularly those who were associated with the INA ‚Äì were treated with disdain as they were \\"stigmatized as fascists and Japanese collaborators\\". Some within this diaspora later emerged as notable political and social leaders. The consolidation of trade unions in the form of National Union of Plantation Workers was led by ex-INA leaders. In Malaya, notable members of the INA were involved in founding the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) in 1946; John Thivy was the founding president. Janaky Athi Nahappan, second-in-command of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, was also a founding member of the MIC and later became a noted welfare activist and a distinguished senator in the Dewan Negara of the Malaysian Parliament. Rasammah Bhupalan, also of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, later became a well-known welfare-activist and a widely respected champion for women's rights in Malaysia. Relations =Japanese Army= The army's relationship with the Japanese was an uncomfortable one. Officers in the INA distrusted the Japanese. Leaders of the first INA sought formal assurances from Japan before committing to war. When these did not arrive, Mohan Singh resigned after ordering his army to disband; he expected to be sentenced to death. After Bose established Azad Hind, he tried to establish his political independence from the regime that supported him. (He had led protests against the Japanese expansion into China, and supported Chiang Kai-shek during the 1930s) Azad Hind depended on Japan for arms and material but sought to be as financially independent as possible, levying taxes and raising donations from Indians in Southeast Asia\\". On the Japanese side, members of the high command had been personally impressed by Bose and were willing to grant him some latitude; more importantly, the Japanese were interested in maintaining the support of a man who had been able to mobilise large numbers of Indian expatriates ‚Äì including, most importantly, 40,000 of the 45,000 Indians captured by the Japanese at Singapore. However, Faye notes that interactions between soldiers in the field was different. Attempts to use Shah Nawaz's troops in road building and as porters angered the troops, forcing Bose to intervene with Mutaguchi. After the withdrawal from Imphal, the relations between both junior non-commissioned officers and between senior officers had deteriorated. INA officers accused the Japanese Army high command of trying to deceive INA troops into fighting for Japan. Conversely, Japanese soldiers often expressed disdain for INA soldiers for having changed their oath of loyalty. This mutual dislike was especially strong after the withdrawal from Imphal began; Japanese soldiers, suspicious that INA defectors had been responsible for their defeat, addressed INA soldiers as \\"shameless one\\" instead of \\"comrade\\" as previously had been the case. Azad Hind officials in Burma reported difficulties with the Japanese military administration in arranging supply for troops and transport for wounded men as the armies withdrew. Toye notes that local IIL members and Azad Hind Dal (local Azad Hind administrative teams) organised relief supplies from Indians in Burma at this time. As the situation in Burma became hopeless for the Japanese, Bose refused requests to use INA troops against Aung San's Burma National Army, which had turned against Japan and was now allied with Commonwealth forces. INA memorial in Singapore after demolition by British Indian Army sappers. Circa September 1945. =British-Indian Army= The first interaction of the INA with the British-Indian forces was during the months during the First Arakan offensive, between December 1942 and March 1943. The morale of Sepoys during this time was low and knowledge about the INA was minimal. The INA's special services agents led a successful operation during this time in encouraging the Indian troops to defect to the INA. By the end of March 1945, however, the Sepoys in the British-Indian Army were reinvigorated and perceived the men of the INA to be savage turncoats and cowards. Senior British officers in the Indian Army considered them \\"rabble\\". Historians Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper mention that sepoys in field units shot captured or wounded INA men, relieving their British officers of the complex task of formulating a formal plan for captured men. After Singapore was retaken, Mountbatten ordered the INA's war memorial to its fallen soldiers to be blown up. As the story of the INA unfolded in post-war India, the view of Indian soldiers on the INA ‚Äì and on their own position during the war ‚Äì also changed. The Raj observed with increasing disquiet and unease the spread of pro-INA sympathies within the troops of the British-Indian forces. In February 1946, while the trials were still going on, a general strike by ratings of the Royal Indian Navy rapidly deteriorated into a mutiny incorporating ships and shore establishments of the RIN throughout India. The mutineers raised slogans invoking Subhas Bose and the INA, demanding an end to the trials. The mutiny received widespread public support. In some places in the British-Indian Army, non-commissioned Officers started ignoring orders from British superiors. In Madras and Pune British garrisons faced revolts from within the ranks of the British-Indian Army. These were suppressed by force. At the conclusion of the first trial, when the sentences of deportation were commuted, Fay records Claude Auchinleck as having sent a \\"personal and secret\\" letter to all senior British officers, explaining: Influence =World War II= Fay concludes that the INA was not significant enough to beat the British-Indian Army by military strength. He also writes that the INA was aware of this and formulated its own strategy of avoiding set-piece battles, gathering local and popular support within India and instigating revolt within the British-Indian Army to overthrow the Raj. Moreover, the Forward Bloc underground movement within India had been crushed well before the offensives opened in the Burma‚ÄìManipur theatre, depriving the army of any organised internal support. However, despite its small numerical strength and lack of heavy weapons, its special services group played a significant part in halting the First Arakan Offensive while still under Mohan Singh's command. The propaganda threat of the INA and lack of concrete intelligence on the unit early after the fall of Singapore made it a threat to Allied war plans in Southeast Asia, since it threatened to destroy the Sepoys' loyalty to a British-Indian Army that was demoralised from continuing defeats. There were reports of INA operatives successfully infiltrating Commonwealth lines during the Offensive. This caused British intelligence to begin the \\"Jiffs\\" propaganda campaign and to create \\"Josh\\" groups to improve the morale and preserve the loyalty of the sepoys as consolidation began to prepare for the defence of Manipur. These measures included imposing a complete news ban on Bose and the INA that was not lifted until four days after the fall of Rangoon two years later. During the Japanese U-Go offensive towards Manipur in 1944, the INA played a crucial (and successful) role in diversionary attacks in Arakan and in the Manipur Basin itself, where it fought alongside Mutaguchi's 15th Army. INA forces protected the flanks of the assaulting Yamamoto force at a critical time as the latter attempted to take Imphal. During the Commonwealth Burma Campaign, the INA troops fought in the battles of Irrawaddy and Meiktilla, supporting the Japanese offensive and tying down Commonwealth troops. =Indian independence= The first INA trial, which was held in public, became a rallying point for the independence movement from the autumn of 1945. The release of INA prisoners and the suspension of the trials came to be the dominant political campaign, superseding the campaign for independence. Christopher Bayly notes that the \\"INA was to become a much more powerful enemy of the British empire in defeat than it had been during its ill-fated triumphal march on Delhi.\\" The Viceroy's journal describes the autumn and winter of 1945‚Äì1946 as \\"The Edge of a Volcano\\". The setting of the trial at Red Fort was taken by Indian public as a deliberate taunt by the British Raj over the vanquished INA, recalling the INA's battle cries of unfurling the Indian tricolour over the Red Fort. Many compared the trials to that of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor tried in the same place after the failed 1857 uprising. Support for the INA grew rapidly and their continued detention and news of impending trials was seen an affront to the movement for independence and to Indian identity itself. It was further feared that the Congress would exploit the INA to gain mass support against the Raj and possibly start an armed struggle with weapons smuggled from Burma. Nehru was suspected of using INA men to train Congress volunteers. The political effects of the INA trials were enormous and were felt around India as late as 1948, much to the chagrin of the Congress government in independent India, which feared that pro-INA sympathies could help alternative sources of power. Historians like Sumit Sarkar, Sugata Bose, Ayesha Jalal conclude that the INA trials and its after-effects brought a decisive shift in British policy towards independence Indian . Particularly disturbing was the overt and public support for the INA by the soldiers of the Indian Army and the mutinies. The Congress's rhetoric preceding the 1946 elections gave the Raj reasons to fear a revival of the Quit India Movement of 1942. It was soon realised that the Indian Army could not be used to suppress such a movement as it had in 1942, principally because of nationalistic and political consciousness in the forces which was ascribed to the INA. Gandhi noted: Facing problems in the British mainland and unable to muster enough forces of collaboration or coercion, the Cabinet mission of 1946 was sent to negotiate the transfer of power. Some historians cite Auchinleck's own assessment of the situation to suggest this shortened the Raj by at least fifteen to twenty years. Clement Attlee, the British prime minister, reflecting on the factors that guided the British decision to relinquish the Raj in India, is said to have cited the effects of the INA and Bose's activities on the British-Indian Army and the Bombay Mutiny as being the most important. =British colonies= After the war ended, the story of the INA and the Indian Legion was seen as so inflammatory that, fearing mass revolts and uprisings across its empire, the British Government forbade the BBC from broadcasting their story. The use of Indian troops for the restoration of Dutch and French rule in Vietnam and Indonesia fed into the already growing resentment within the forces. Indian troops sent to suppress Sukarno's agitations in Indonesia in 1946 rapidly identified with the nationalist sentiments in the previous Dutch colony. The South East Asia Command reported growing sympathy for the INA and dislike of the Dutch. There were similar pro-nationalist sentiments among Indian troops sent to Vietnam, Thailand and Burma. This led to the realisation by 1946 that the British- Indian Army, the bulwark of the policing force in the British colonies, could not be used as an instrument of British power. INA-inspired strikes emerged throughout Britain's colonies in Southeast Asia. In January 1946, protests started at Royal Air Force bases in Karachi and spread rapidly to Singapore. This was followed by a full-scale mutiny by a British Army unit in Singapore. In British Malaya, men of the Parachute Regiment refused to obey orders from their officers. Authors like Nilanjana Sengupta attribute these to a combination of dissatisfaction over pay and work conditions and conflicts of comradeship over the INA trials. Former INA members in Malaya identified closely with the left-wing organisations in opposing British colonial authority. The majority of prominent left-wing union leaders in Malaya after the war were members of the INA. The activities of the trade unions in the newly established Tamil schools were particularly influential, leading to the establishment of an inspector system by the British to supervise the curriculum and teaching in these schools. Joyce Lebra notes that the INA had a particularly strong unifying influence over ethnic Indians residing in Malaya. Lebra concludes that the experience of the INA was useful in challenging British authority in the post-war period in Malaya, and in improving the socio-economic conditions of the Indian community. Controversies British and Commonwealth troops viewed the recruits as traitors and Axis collaborators. Almost 40,000 Indian soldiers in Malaya did not join the army and remained as PoWs. Many were sent to work in the Death Railway, suffered hardships and nearly 11,000 died under Japanese internment. Many of them cited the oath of allegiance they had taken to the King among reasons not to join a Japanese-supported organisation, and regarded the recruits of the INA as traitors for having forsaken their oath. Commanders in the British-Indian Army like Wavell later highlighted the hardships this group of soldiers suffered, contrasting them with the troops of the INA. Many British soldiers held the same opinion., Hugh Toye and Peter Fay point out that the First INA consisted of a mix of recruits joining for various reasons, such as nationalistic leanings, Mohan Singh's appeals, personal ambition or to protect men under their own command from harm. Fay notes some officers like Shah Nawaz Khan were opposed to Mohan Singh's ideas and tried to hinder what they considered a collaborationist organisation. However, both historians note that Indian civilians and former INA soldiers all cite the tremendous influence of Subhas Bose and his appeal to patriotism in rejuvenating the INA. Fay discusses the topic of loyalty of the INA soldiers, and highlights that in Shah Nawaz Khan's trial it was noted that officers of the INA warned their men the possibility of having to fight the Japanese after having fought the British, to prevent Japan exploiting post-war India. Carl Vadivella Belle suggested in 2014 that among the local Indians and ex-British-Indian Army volunteers in Malaya, there was a proportion who joined due to the threat of conscription as Japanese labour troops. Recruitment also offered local Indian labourers security from continual semi-starvation of the estates and served as a barrier against Japanese tyranny. INA troops were alleged to engage in or be complicit in torture of Allied and Indian prisoners of war. Fay in his 1993 history analyses war-time press releases and field counter-intelligence directed at Sepoys. He concludes that the Jiffs campaign promoted the view that INA recruits were weak-willed and traitorous Axis collaborators, motivated by selfish interests of greed and personal gain. He concludes that the allegations of torture were largely products of the Jiffs campaign. He supports his conclusion by noting that isolated cases of torture had occurred, but allegations of widespread practice of torture were not substantiated in the charges against defendants in the Red Fort trials. Published memoirs of several veterans, including that of William Slim, portray the INA troops as incapable fighters and as untrustworthy. Toye noted in 1959 that individual desertions occurred in the withdrawal from Imphal. Fay concluded that stories of INA desertions during the battle and the initial retreat into Burma were largely exaggerated. The majority of desertions occurred much later, according to Fay, around the battles at Irrawaddy and later around Popa. Fay specifically discusses Slim's portrayal of the INA, pointing out what he concludes to be inconsistencies in Slim's accounts. Fay also discusses memoirs of Shah Nawaz, where Khan claims INA troops were never defeated in battle. Fay criticises this too as exaggerated. He concludes the opinions held by Commonwealth war veterans such as Slim were an inaccurate portrayal of the unit, as were those of INA soldiers themselves. Harkirat Singh notes that British officers' personal dislike for Subhas Chandra Bose may have prejudiced their judgement of the INA itself. In independent India, the treatment of former INA soldiers by government and omission of the INA and the Red Fort trials from historical records of the period leading up to Indian independence in 1947 have come in for criticisms. Indian activists like Samar Guha, historians like Kapil Kumar, as well as Indian parliamentarians allege that official histories of the independence movement largely omit events surrounding the INA ‚Äì especially the Red Fort trials and the Bombay Mutiny ‚Äì and ignore their significance in rejuvenating the independence movement and guiding British decisions to relinquish the Raj. A history of the army and of Azad Hind, written by Indian historian Pratul Chandra Gupta in 1950s at the request of the Indian Government, was subsequently classified and not released until 2006. Further criticisms have been made in recent years over the denial till 1980s of the \\"freedom fighter's pension\\" awarded to those in the Gandhian movement, and over the general hardships and apathy surrounding the conditions of former INA soldiers. This includes, for example, the circumstances surrounding the death and funeral of Ram Singh Thakuri, the composer of the INA's anthem Quami tarana', kadam kadam badaye ja. These have been compounded by a number of conspiracy-theories and news reports in the past on agreements between the Indian political leadership to hand over its leader Subhas Chandra Bose as a war criminal if he was found to be alive. The Indian government refused to declassify secret documents on Bose and the INA held in Indian archives for almost sixty years citing concerns of India's relations with foreign countries. This decision was revisited in October 2015 by Narendra Modi government. However, some files are said to have been destroyed altogether. Later historians have argued that, given the political aim and nature of the entire Azad Hind movement and especially the Indian National Army, Nehru's aim may have been to prevent politicisation of the army and assert civilian authority over the military. More recent controversies have risen from limited declassified Indian documents that revealed that the Nehru government kept Subhas Bose's family under strict surveillance for more than twenty years after Indian independence. Further controversy relates to the fate of the Azad Hind fortune Bose is said to have been travelling with it during in his last known journey. The treasure, a considerable amount of gold ornaments and gems, is said to have been recovered from Bose's belongings following the fatal plane crash in Formosa that reportedly killed him. Despite repeated warnings from Indian diplomats in Tokyo, Nehru is said to have disregarded allegations that men previously associated with Azad Hind misappropriated the funds for personal benefit. Some of these are said to have travelled to Japan repeatedly with the approval of Nehru government and were later given government roles implementing Nehru's political and economic agenda. A very small portion of the alleged treasure was repatriated to India in the 1950s. Commemorations plaque erected by the National Heritage Board at Esplanade Park, marking the INA Monument site in Singapore Postage stamps released by Indian National Army in display at Netaji Birth Place Museum, Cuttack The INA is memorialised in the Swatantrata Sainani Smarak, which is located at the Salimgarh Fort in Delhi, adjacent to the Red Fort. Its exhibits include the Indian National Army uniform worn by Colonel Prem Sahgal, riding boots and coat buttons of Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and photographs of Subhas Chandra Bose. A separate gallery holds material and photographs from excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India inside the fort in 1995. The Indian National Army Memorial at Moirang, Manipur, commemorates the place where the flag of Azad Hind was raised by Col. Shaukat Hayat Malik. Moirang was the first Indian territory captured by the INA. The INA War Memorial at Singapore commemorating the \\"Unknown Warrior\\" of the INA was unveiled by Bose in July 1945. Situated at the Esplanade Park, it was destroyed on Mountbatten's orders when Allied troops reoccupied the city. In 1995, the National Heritage Board of Singapore, with financial donations from the Indian community in Singapore, erected the Former Indian National Army Monument at the site where the old memorial stood. The site is now officially one of the historical sites of Singapore. The INA's battle cry, Jai Hind, was declared the \\"national greeting\\" of India by Nehru and remains a popular nationalist greeting. Today it is used by all Indian prime ministers to conclude their Independence Day speeches. The cry became independent India's first commemorative post mark on 15 August 1947. The first postage stamps issued by Independent India are called the Jai Hind series of stamps, showing the Indian flag with the letters Jai Hind in the top right hand corner. These were a part of the series issued on 15 August 1947. Commemorative postage stamps were also issued by the Indian government in 1968 and 1993 respectively to commemorate the 25th and the 50th anniversaries of the establishment of Azad Hind at Singapore. The Department of Posts also includes the six unused Azad Hind stamps in its commemorative book India's Freedom Struggle through India Postage Stamps. The Azad Hind Fauj Marg (Azad Hind Fauj Road) in New Delhi is named after the INA and houses the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology. In popular culture The Indian National Army remains a significant topic of discussion in the popular history of India; it is an emotive topic which has been the subject of numerous works of literature, art, and visual media within India and outside. Some of the earliest works in print media were created at the time of the INA trials. These include works of fiction like Jai Hind: The Diary of a Rebel Daughter of India published in 1945 by Amritlal Seth. The book, a work of fiction narrating the story of a recruit of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, is believed to be loosely based on the story of Lakshmi Sahgal. In later decades works by authors like Amitav Ghosh, such as his book The Glass Palace, have used the backdrop of the Azad Hind and the Japanese occupation of Burma for the narrative of the story. The Day of the Scorpion and The Towers of Silence, the second and third books in Paul Scott's Raj Quartet, mention Jiffs in the political and social context in which the term found use in the Eastern Army during the war. The 1984 British TV series The Jewel in the Crown, based on Scott's quartet, also includes the role of the INA as part of the political backdrop of the story. In visual media, the INA has been the subject of a number of documentaries. The War of The Springing Tiger made by Granada Television for Channel 4 in 1984 examined the role of the Indian National Army in the Second World War, the motivation of its soldiers and explored its role in the independence movement. In 1999 Film India released a documentary, The Forgotten Army. Directed by Kabir Khan and produced by Akhil Bakshi, it followed what was called the Azad Hind Expedition between 1994 and 1995, retracing the route taken by the INA from Singapore to Imphal, before ending at Red Fort. Amongst the members of expedition team were Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon, Lakshmi Sahgal and Captain S.S. Yadava, an INA veteran and once the general secretary of the All India INA Committee. The documentary went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the Film South Asia festival in 1999. The National Archives of Singapore digitised its available resources in 2007 as Historical Journey of the Indian National Army. In 2004, the Indian Legion in Europe was the subject of a BBC magazine article authored by Mike Thomson, but it did not attempt to distinguish the differences between the Legion and the INA. The Hindustan Times, a large broadsheet in India, dedicates a part of its website to INA resources as Indian National Army in East Asia. Indian cinema has also seen a number of films in many different Indian languages, where the INA is a significant part of the narrative. These include Pahla Admi by Bimal Roy and Samadhi by Ramesh Saigal, both produced in 1950 based on fictional INA veterans. More recently, Indian, a 1996 Tamil film directed by S. Shankar, incorporates a lead character in its story who is a veteran of the INA. Shyam Benegal produced Netaji: The Forgotten Hero in 2004, which traces the last five years of Subhas Chandra Bose. Benegal describes the story of the INA in small details in his film whilst focusing on its leader. The film was also widely noted for A. R. Rahman's music. The INA's marching song, Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja, has since become a famous patriotic song in India. Today it is in use as the regimental quick march of the Indian Parachute regiment. More recently, a 2017 Hindi movie Rangoon, starring Kangna Ranaut, Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor is based against the backdrop of the INA presence in Rangoon, with the movie centered around the protagonists trying to get across a jeweled sword to the INA. In 2020 Amazon Prime Video released a five-part series called The Forgotten Army - Azaadi Ke Liye! Which tells the story of the INA through the eyes of one of its Captains and the woman he loves.

As with any Scotch whisky, a single malt Scotch must be distilled in Scotland and matured in oak casks in Scotland for at least three years. (Most single malts are matured longer.)How Single Malt Whisky Is MadeFAQs Definitions * \\"Malt\\" indicates that the whisky is distilled from a \\"malted\\" barley. Malting calls for soaking the grains in water for several days until it germinates. Heat is then applied to stop the germination, often, using peat as the fuel. Other grains, such as rye or wheat, can be malted for other types of whisky, but barley must be used for single malt Scotch. The dry malt is ground into flour (grist) and mixed with hot water; this mashing process converts the starch into sugar. Later, yeast is added to increase the process of fermentation. Finally, impurities such as methanol are removed during distillation; that also increases the alcohol content.Difference Between Single Malt and Blended Scotch Whisky * \\"Single\\" indicates that all the spirits in the bottle come from a single distillery.That distillery may combine single malt whiskies of several ages in a bottle. Another term is sometimes seen, \\"double malt Scotch\\" or \\"triple malt\\". This designation indicates that the whisky was aged in two or three types of casks, but was not blended; hence, it still falls into the single malt category. The more common term for this type of whisky is \\"double wood\\" or \\"triple wood\\". Examples include The Balvenie 12 Years Old DoubleWood and Laphroaig Triple Wood.The Scotch Whisky Guide Many companies use malt whisky purchased from multiple distilleries, and these whiskies combined into \\"blended malt\\".Difference Between Single Malt and Blended Scotch Whisky Until the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 (SWR 2009), the word \\"blended\\" only appeared (in the context of Scotch whisky) on bottles of whisky that contained a mixture of both barley and non-barley grain whisky, but this is no longer the case. Under the terminology established by the SWR 2009, the term \\"blended malt Scotch whisky\\" replaced the term \\"vatted malt\\" to describe a mixture of single malt Scotch whiskies (malted barley whisky). Only about 10% of the Scotch whiskies on the market are defined as single malt.FAQsThe other 90% is made by combining numerous whiskies, typically two-thirds grain whisky (non-barley) and one- third malt whisky, from several, or numerous, distilleries in Scotland. The resulting products are labeled \\"blended Scotch whisky\\", without the word \\"malt\\".Difference Between Single Malt and Blended Scotch Whisky Nearly 90% of Scotch whisky sold each year is a blended type.FAQs Nonetheless, in 2018, single malt Scotch made up nearly 28% of the ¬£4.7 billion of whisky exported from Scotland.HMRC data shows Scotch exports hit record high in 2018 For any Scotch whisky, whether malt or blended, the age statement on a bottle refers to the number of years the whisky spent maturing in casks. Very few whiskies are bottled from a single cask. The mixing of spirits with different amounts of ageing is allowed; the age statement of the resulting mix reflects the age of the youngest whisky in the bottle.Age Statement History Distillation of whisky has been performed in Scotland for centuries. The earliest written record of whisky production in Scotland from malted barley is an entry on the 1494 Exchequer Rolls, which reads \\"Eight bolls of malt to Friar John Cor, by order of the King, wherewith to make aqua vitae.\\" In the following centuries, the various governments of Scotland began taxing the production of whisky, to the point that most of the spirit was produced illegally. However, in 1823, Parliament passed the Excise Act making commercial distillation legal and profitable. Punishments were imposed on landowners when unlicensed distilleries were found on their properties. An Upper Drummin farmer in the Glen Livet valley, George Smith, working under landlord the Duke of Gordon, was the first person in Scotland to take out a licence for a distillery under the new law, founding what would become the Glenlivet Distillery in 1824, making single malt Scotch.THE GLENLIVET HISTORYThe Glenlivet Single Malt Whisky In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey patented a refined version of a design originally created by Robert Stein, based on early innovations by Sir Anthony Perrier, for a column still.[https://bespokeunit.com/whisky/history/ A Comprehensive Yet Concise History of Scotch Whisky] This new method produced whisky much more efficiently than the traditional pot stills.The History of Whisky and Whiskey The new type of still allowed for continuous distillation, without the need for cleaning after each batch was made. This process made manufacturing more affordable by performing the equivalent of multiple distillation steps.The Difference Between Pot Versus Column Stills, Explained The new still dramatically increased production; the whisky was less intense and smoother, though less flavoursome.The Difference Between Pot Versus Column Stills, Explained Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with grain whisky distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended Scotch proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt, and exhibited more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations, or to sell their products to other distillers who were making the blended products. After the 1850s, blended Scotch became far more popular than single malt whisky which eventually became a niche product for connoisseurs.[https://scotchwhisky.com/magazine/features/22618/the-secret- history-of-single-malts/ THE SECRET HISTORY OF SINGLE MALTS A 2016 report stated that only 20% of the Scotch whisky was made by companies owned in Scotland.A Comprehensive Yet Concise History of Scotch Whisky The owners of the majority of products are Diageo, a London-based company, and Pernod Ricard of France while Japanese company Suntory owns Morrison-Bowmore.Where Is Whisky Produced Independent distilleries owned by Scots companies make a substantial amount of whisky too, particularly William Grant & Sons, the largest of these.

Single malt Scotch whiskies are categorised into the following whisky-producing regions: Highland single malts, Island single malts (A sub-section of the Highland region), Speyside single malts, Islay single malts, Lowland single malts, and Campbeltown single malts. Independent bottlers Independent bottlers buy casks of single malts and either bottle them immediately or store them for future use. Many of the independents began as stores and merchants who bought the whisky in bulk and bottled it for individual sales. Many distilleries do not bottle their whisky as a single malt, so independent bottlings are the only way the single malt gets to market. The bottling process is generally the same, but independents generally do not have access to the distillery's water source, so another source is used to dilute the whisky. Additionally, independents are generally less concerned with maintaining a particular style, so more single year and single cask bottlings are produced. Established independent bottlers include Duncan Taylor, Master of Malt, Murray McDavid, Douglas Laing & Co, Signatory, Hart Brothers, Cadenhead's, and Blackadder.

Collectively called cabin crew, flight attendants are primarily responsible for passenger safety and comfort.  History  Dutch stewardesses, Istanbul, 1959 The role of a flight attendant derives from that of similar positions on passenger ships or passenger trains, but it has more direct involvement with passengers because of the confined quarters on aircraft. Additionally, the job of a flight attendant revolves around safety to a much greater extent than those of similar staff on other forms of transportation. Flight attendants on board a flight collectively form a cabin crew, as distinguished from pilots and engineers in the cockpit. The German Heinrich Kubis was the world's first flight attendant, in 1912. Kubis first attended the passengers on board the DELAG Zeppelin LZ 10 Schwaben. He also attended to the famous LZ 129 Hindenburg and was on board when it burst into flames. He survived by jumping out a window when it neared the ground. Origins of the word \\"steward\\" in transportation are reflected in the term \\"chief steward\\" as used in maritime transport terminology. The term purser and chief steward are often used interchangeably describing personnel with similar duties among seafaring occupations. This lingual derivation results from the international British maritime tradition (i.e. chief mate) dating back to the 14th century and the civilian United States Merchant Marine on which US aviation is somewhat modelled. Due to international conventions and agreements, in which all ships' personnel who sail internationally are similarly documented by their respective countries, the U.S. Merchant Marine assigns such duties to the chief steward in the overall rank and command structure of which pursers are not positionally represented or rostered. Nelly Diener, the first air stewardess in Europe, hired in May 1934. She was killed, on the plane pictured behind her, in the July 1934 Swissair Tuttlingen accident. Imperial Airways of the United Kingdom had \\"cabin boys\\" or \\"stewards\\"; in the 1920s. In the US, Stout Airways was the first to employ stewards in 1926, working on Ford Trimotor planes between Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Western Airlines (1928) and Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) (1929) were the first US carriers to employ stewards to serve food. Ten- passenger Fokker aircraft used in the Caribbean had stewards in the era of gambling trips to Havana, Cuba from Key West, Florida. Lead flight attendants would in many instances also perform the role of purser, steward, or chief steward in modern aviation terminology. The first female flight attendant was a 25-year-old registered nurse named Ellen Church. Hired by United Airlines in 1930, she also first envisioned nurses on aircraft. Other airlines followed suit, hiring nurses to serve as flight attendants, then called \\"stewardesses\\" or \\"air hostesses\\", on most of their flights. In the United States, the job was one of only a few in the 1930s to permit women, which, coupled with the Great Depression, led to large numbers of applicants for the few positions available. Two thousand women applied for just 43 positions offered by Transcontinental and Western Airlines in December 1935.\\"The air hostess carries on\\", The New York Times. April 19, 1936. Page XX12. Washing dishes during flight, 1949 Female flight attendants rapidly replaced male ones, and by 1936, they had all but taken over the role. They were selected not only for their knowledge but also for their physical characteristics. A 1936 New York Times article described the requirements: > The girls who qualify for hostesses must be petite; weight 100 to 118 > pounds; height 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches; age 20 to 26 years. Add to that > the rigid physical examination each must undergo four times every year, and > you are assured of the bloom that goes with perfect health. Three decades later, a 1966 New York Times classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements: > A high school graduate, single (widows and divorcees with no children > considered), 20 years of age (girls 19 may apply for future consideration). > 5'2\\" but no more than 5'9\\", weight 105 to 135 in proportion to height and > have at least 20/40 vision without glasses.\\"63 Years Flying, From Glamour to > Days of Gray\\". New York Times. March 17, 2012. Appearance was considered as one of the most important factors to become a stewardess. At that time, airlines believed that the exploitation of female sexuality would increase their profits; thus the uniforms of female flight attendants were often formfitting, complete with white gloves and high heels. Reenactor in Jet Age costume In the United States, they were required to be unmarried and were fired if they decided to wed. The requirement to be a registered nurse on an American airline was relaxed as more women were hired, and disappeared almost entirely during World War II as many nurses joined military nurse corps. Ruth Carol Taylor was the first African-American flight attendant in the United States. Hired in December 1957, on February 11, 1958, Taylor was the flight attendant on a Mohawk Airlines flight from Ithaca to New York, the first time such a position had been held by an African American. She was let go within six months as a result of Mohawk's then-common marriage ban. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's first complainants were female flight attendants complaining of age discrimination, weight requirements, and bans on marriage. (Originally female flight attendants were fired if they reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline, were fired if they exceeded weight regulations, and were required to be single upon hiring and fired if they got married.) In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants‚Äô employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Also in 1968, the EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant. The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of Diaz vs. Pan Am. The no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s. The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions, were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations. Airline still often have vision and height requirements and may require flight attendants to pass a medical evaluation. As there will be 41,030 new airliners by 2036, Boeing expects 839,000 new cabin crew members from 2017 till then: 298,000 in Asia Pacific (37%), 169,000 in North America (21%) and 151,000 in Europe (19%). Overview The role of a flight attendant is to \\"provide routine services and respond to emergencies to ensure the safety and comfort of airline passengers while aboard planes\\". Typically flight attendants require holding a high school diploma or equivalent, and in the United States, the median annual wage for flight attendants was $50,500 in May 2017, higher than the median for all workers of $37,690. The number of flight attendants required on flights is mandated by each country's regulations. In the US, for light planes with 19 or fewer seats, or, if weighing more than 7,500 pounds, 9 or fewer seats, no flight attendant is needed; on larger aircraft, one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats is required. The majority of flight attendants for most airlines are female, though a substantial number of males have entered the industry since 1980.Saenz, Rogelio and Evans, Louwanda (June 2009) \\"The Changing Demography of U.S. Flight Attendants\\".

During this briefing, they go over safety and emergency checklists, the locations and amounts of emergency equipment and other features specific to that aircraft type. Boarding particulars are verified, such as special needs passengers, small children travelling as unaccompanied or VIPs. Weather conditions are discussed including anticipated turbulence. Prior to each flight a safety check is conducted to ensure all equipment such as life-vests, torches (flash lights) and firefighting equipment are on board, in the right quantity, and in proper condition. Any unserviceable or missing items must be reported and rectified prior to take-off. They must monitor the cabin for any unusual smells or situations. They assist with the loading of carry-on baggage, checking for weight, size and dangerous goods. They make sure those sitting in emergency exit rows are willing and able to assist in an evacuation and move those who are not willing or able out of the row into another seat. They then must do a safety demonstration or monitor passengers as they watch a safety video. They then must \\"secure the cabin\\" ensuring tray tables are stowed, seats are in their upright positions, armrests down and carry-ons stowed correctly and seat belts are fastened prior to take-off. All the service between boarding and take-off is called Pre Take off Service. Aeroflot flight attendant, Belgrade (2017) Once up in the air, flight attendants will usually serve drinks and/or food to passengers using an airline service trolley. When not performing customer service duties, flight attendants must periodically conduct cabin checks and listen for any unusual noises or situations. Checks must also be done on the lavatory to ensure the smoke detector hasn't been disabled or destroyed and to restock supplies as needed. Regular cockpit checks must be done to ensure the health and safety of the pilot(s). They must also respond to call lights dealing with special requests. During turbulence, flight attendants must ensure the cabin is secure. Prior to landing, all loose items, trays and rubbish must be collected and secured along with service and galley equipment. All hot liquids must be disposed of. A final cabin check must then be completed prior to landing. It is vital that flight attendants remain aware as the majority of emergencies occur during take-off and landing. Upon landing, flight attendants must remain stationed at exits and monitor the airplane and cabin as passengers disembark the plane. They also assist any special needs passengers and small children off the airplane and escort children, while following the proper paperwork and ID process to escort them to the designated person picking them up. Flight attendants are trained to deal with a wide variety of emergencies, and are trained in first aid. More frequent situations may include a bleeding nose, illness, small injuries, intoxicated passengers, aggressive and anxiety stricken passengers. Emergency training includes rejected take-offs, emergency landings, cardiac and in- flight medical situations, smoke in the cabin, fires, depressurization, on- board births and deaths, dangerous goods and spills in the cabin, emergency evacuations, hijackings, and water landings. Flight attendants for Germanwings delivering in-flight services =Chief Purser= The Chief Purser (CP), also titled as In-flight Service Manager (ISM), Flight Service Manager (FSM), Customer Service Manager (CSM) or Cabin Service Director (CSD) is the senior flight attendant in the chain of command of flight attendants. While not necessarily the most-senior crew members on a flight (in years of service to their respective carrier), Chief Pursers can have varying levels of \\"in- flight\\" or \\"on board\\" bidding seniority or tenure in relation to their flying partners. To reach this position, a crew member requires some minimum years of service as flight attendant. Further training is mandatory, and Chief Pursers typically earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and managerial role. =Purser= The Purser is in charge of the cabin crew, in a specific section of a larger aircraft, or the whole aircraft itself (if the purser is the highest ranking). On board a larger aircraft, Pursers assist the Chief Purser in managing the cabin. Pursers are flight attendants or a related job, typically with an airline for several years prior to application for, and further training to become a purser, and normally earn a higher salary than flight attendants because of the added responsibility and supervisory role. Qualifications =Training= Flight attendants are normally trained in the hub or headquarters city of an airline over a period that may run from four weeks to six months, depending on the country and airline. The main focus of training is safety, and attendants will be checked out for each type of aircraft in which they work. One of the most elaborate training facilities was Breech Academy, which Trans World Airlines (TWA) opened in 1969 in Overland Park, Kansas. Other airlines were to also send their attendants to the school. However, during the fare wars, the school's viability declined and it closed around 1988. Safety training includes, but is not limited to: emergency passenger evacuation management, use of evacuation slides/life rafts, in-flight firefighting, first aid, CPR, defibrillation, ditching/emergency landing procedures, decompression emergencies, crew resource management, and security. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires flight attendants on aircraft with 20 or more seats and used by an air carrier for transportation to hold a Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency. This is not considered to be the equivalent of an airman certificate (license), although it is issued on the same card stock. It shows that a level of required training has been met. It is not limited to the air carrier at which the attendant is employed (although some initial documents showed the airlines where the holders were working), and is the attendant's personal property. It does have two ratings, Group 1 and Group 2 (listed on the certificate as \\"Group I\\" and \\"Group II\\"). Either or both of these may be earned depending upon the general type of aircraft, (propeller or turbojet), on which the holder has trained. There are also training schools, not affiliated with any particular airline, where students generally not only undergo generic, though otherwise practically identical, training to flight attendants employed by an airline, but also take curriculum modules to help them gain employment. These schools often use actual airline equipment for their lessons, though some are equipped with full simulator cabins capable of replicating a number of emergency situations. In some countries, such as France, a degree is required, together with the Certificat de Formation √† la S√©curit√© (safety training certificate).Certificat de Formation √† la S√©curit√© =Language= Multilingual flight attendants are often in demand to accommodate international travellers. The languages most in demand, other than English, are French, Russian, Hindi, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Bengali, Japanese, Arabic, German, Portuguese, Italian, Turkish and Greek. In the United States, airlines with international routes pay an additional stipend for language skills on top of flight pay, and some airlines hire specifically for certain languages when launching international destinations. =Height= Most airlines have height requirements for safety reasons, making sure that all flight attendants can reach overhead safety equipment. Typically, the acceptable height for this is tall. Some airlines, such as EVA Air, have height requirements for purely aesthetic purposes. Regional carriers using small aircraft with low ceilings can have height restrictions. Uniforms and presentation Garuda Indonesia flight attendants in uniform featuring kebaya. The first flight attendant uniforms were designed to be durable, practical, and inspire confidence in passengers. In the 1930s, the first female flight attendants dressed in uniforms resembling nurses' outfits. The first female flight attendants for United Airlines wore green berets, green capes and nurse's shoes. Other airlines, such as Eastern Air Lines, actually dressed female flight attendants in nurses' uniforms. Both male and female flight attendants for Hawaiian Airlines wear aloha shirts as their uniform. During the 1960s, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) was known for brightly colored female flight attendant uniforms that included short miniskirts. In the early 1970s, the uniform changed to hotpants.Forbes Magazine: October 1, 2001-Under the Radar by Doug Donovan Photo shows PSA flight attendants in 1960s. Many early uniforms had a strongly military appearance; hats, jackets, and skirts showed simple straight lines and military details like epaulettes and brass buttons. Many uniforms had a summer and winter version, differentiated by colours and fabrics appropriate to the season: navy blue for winter, for example, khaki for summer. But as the role of women in the air grew, and airline companies began to realise the publicity value of their female flight attendants, more feminine lines and colours began to appear in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Some airlines began to commission designs from high-end department stores and still others called in noted designers or even milliners to create distinctive and attractive apparel. During the 1960s, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) was known for brightly colored female flight attendant uniforms that included short miniskirts. In the early 1970s, the uniform changed to hotpants. Since the 1980s to present, Asian airlines, especially national flag carrier ones, usually feature the traditional dress and fabrics of their respective country in their female flight attendants' uniform. It was meant as a marketing strategy to showcase their national culture as well as to convey welcoming warmth and hospitality. For example, Thai Airways flight attendants are required to change from their corporate purple suits into traditional Thai costume prior to passengers boarding. While the uniform of Garuda Indonesia female flight attendants is a modified kebaya, inspired by the traditional batik motif of Parang Gondosuli, the motif is called Lereng Garuda Indonesia. Malaysian and Singapore Airlines flight attendants wear batik prints in their uniform. Vietnam Airlines flight attendants wear red √°o d√†i and Air India flight attendants wear a Sari on all passenger flights. During the mid-1990s, several US-based airlines required female flight attendants to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from one-half inch to the two inches mandated by USAir. Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there. In 2015, the Israeli airline El Al introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated. The airline's workers' union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule. Later that year the requirement was removed. Until 2016, some female crew members on British Airways were required to wear British Airways' standard \\"ambassador\\" uniform, which has not traditionally included trousers. In 2019, Virgin Atlantic began to allow its female flight attendants to wear pants and not wear makeup. Flight attendants are generally expected to show a high level of personal grooming such as use of cosmetics (for women) and thorough personal hygiene. Most airlines require flight attendants not have any tattoos visible when a uniform is worn. These requirements are designed to give the airlines a positive presentation. In several airlines in the Islamic World, such as Egypt Air, Iran Air and Saudia, female flight attendants' uniforms have added a hijab to conform to the Islamic customs.  Health conditions  A 2018 study found higher instances of breast cancer, melanoma, uterine, gastrointestinal, cervical, and thyroid cancers reported in flight attendants in contrast to the general population. Specifically, the increased cancer cases reported were seen in breast cancer (3.4% of flight crew compared to 2.3% in the general population - a 50% increase), cervical cancer (1.0% compared to 0.70%), gastrointestinal cancer (0.47% compared to 0.27% - a 74% increase), thyroid cancer (0.67% compared to 0.56%) and higher rates of both melanoma and non- melanoma skin cancers with reports of the latter increasing with every five years spent in the job. The study did not look into what causes this increase, but the authors said increased exposure to ionizing radiation from time spent in the thinner upper atmosphere, poor cabin air quality as well as disrupted sleep and meal cycles could be factors. Other studies have found increased rates of breast and skin cancer, reduced respiratory health, adverse reproductive and perinatal outcomes, musculoskeletal injuries, and higher rates of mental health conditions in flight attendants. = Radiation = Flight attendants and crew members are known to be exposed to cosmic ionizing radiation which is a form of radiation that comes from space and intensifies as altitude above sea level increases. The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization lists Ionizing radiation as a known human carcinogen. Passengers are also exposed to this type of cosmic radiation, but they spend a considerably less amount of time on the average in the air than crew members. An online travel agency report found, in particular, that travelling adults in Britain spend on average 306 hours on flights to holiday destinations during their lifetime. In contrast, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration, a flight attendant can spend up to 30 hours of flight time in seven consecutive days and in some cases more. The effect of cosmic radiation on air crew members is a subject of a growing body of research. Cabin crew members are also regularly exposed to more UV radiation than the general population, which can make these workers more vulnerable to skin cancers. The U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP) reports that aircrew have the largest average annual effective dose of all U.S. radiation workers. = Cabin air quality = Poor cabin air quality is a subject of ongoing study in relation to symptoms such as headache, fatigue, fever, and respiratory difficulties among many others that have been reported by flight attendants, particularly on long-haul routes. There is also much concern regarding the transmission of contagious diseases, particularly tuberculosis. An open question remains whether these complaints are due to poor cabin air quality or to other factors inherent in flights, such as lowered barometric pressure, hypoxia, low humidity, etc. Other chemical contaminants found in the cabin may include engine leakages, pesticides and flame retardants, which contain compounds that may act as hormone disruptors and increase the risk of some cancers. = Sleep disruption = Flight attendants often have disrupted sleep cycles. They are more likely to have disruptions in their sleep patterns because they may work at night, cross time zones, and have irregular schedules. There is some evidence linking sleep disruptions to increased cancer risk. Flight attendants may also have different lifestyle behaviours related to diet, physical activity, and health care than the general population which could affect overall health and cancer risk. = Secondhand tobacco smoke = Many of the flight attendants working today were exposed to second-hand in-flight smoke until 1998 with partial smoking bans enacted in 1988. The long-term effects of this historical secondhand smoke exposure have not been well characterized.  Sexual harassment  Flight attendants are exposed to verbal and sexual harassment. Studies in the United States and Australia have found that the vast majority (two-thirds) of flight attendants experience sexual harassment in the course of their careers, including sexual assault, inappropriate touching and sexual comments both by colleagues and passengers. > Flight attendants describe the verbal sexual harassment as comments that are > ‚Äúnasty, unwanted, lewd, crude, inappropriate, uncomfortable, sexual, > suggestive, and dirty.‚Äù They also report being subjected to passengers‚Äô > explicit sexual fantasies, propositions, request for sexual ‚Äúfavours‚Äù and > pornographic videos and pictures. The studies also found that 70% of flight attendants who experience sexual harassment on the job \\"chose not to report the incident because they did not think it would be dealt with appropriately or they were concerned reporting it would make the situation worse\\" and \\"their airline was not doing enough to put a stop to harassment\\", and that \\"they have not noticed any employer efforts over the past year to address sexual harassment at work.\\"  Emotional labour  The concept of emotional labour as the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfil the emotional requirements of a job through a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace (as opposed to the concept of emotion work, i.e. the management of one's feelings in private life) was first established and linked to the profession of flight attendants by Professor Emirita of Sociology Arlie Hochschild, in her book, The Managed Heart. According to Hochschild, flight attendants do emotional labour to enhance the status of the customer and entice further sales by their friendliness, and support this effort by evoking feelings that make the \\"nice\\" display seem natural. With regard to how flight attendants are supposed to use their smile in the job, the author writes: > \\"[I]n the flight attendant‚Äôs work, smiling is separated from its usual > function, which is to express a personal feeling, and attached to another > one‚Äîexpressing a company feeling. The company exhorts them to smile more, > and ‚Äúmore sincerely,‚Äù at an increasing number of passengers. The workers > respond to the speed-up with a slowdown: they smile less broadly, with a > quick release and no sparkle in the eyes, thus dimming the company‚Äôs message > to the people. It is a war of smiles.\\" Hochschild notes that corporate logic in the airline industry generates a series of links between competition, market expansion, advertising, heightened passenger expectations about rights to display, and company demands for acting; and when conditions allow this logic to work, private use of emotional exchange gives way to corporate use of emotional exchange. Hochschild also writes of how flight attendants are trained to control passengers' feelings during times of turbulence and dangerous situations while suppressing their own fear or anxiety. The emotional labour performed by flight attendants and cross-cultural aspects of it have since been actively studied and are a topic of ongoing research. In advertising Air Serbia flight attendants (Tourist Fair Belgrade 2017) Singapore Girls, featured in Singapore Airlines' advertising In the 1960s and 1970s, many airlines began advertising the attractiveness and friendliness of their stewardesses. National Airlines began a \\"Fly Me\\"; campaign using attractive female flight attendants with taglines such as \\"I'm Lorraine. Fly me to Orlando.\\" (A low budget 1973 film about three flight attendants, Fly Me, starring Lenore Kasdorf, was based on the ad campaign.) Braniff International Airways presented a campaign known as the \\"Air Strip\\" with similarly attractive young female flight attendant changing uniforms mid-flight. In the United States, many airlines had a policy such that only unmarried women could be flight attendants, as well as a mandatory retirement age of 32 for stewardesses because of the belief women would be less appealing and attractive after this age. In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants‚Äô employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Flight attendant Roz Hanby became a minor celebrity when she became the face of British Airways in their \\"Fly the Flag\\" advertising campaign over a 7-year period in the 1980s. Singapore Airlines is currently one of the few airlines still choosing to use the image of their female flight attendants, known as Singapore Girls, in their advertising material. However, this is starting to be phased out, in favor of advertising which emphasises the modernity of their fleet. Unions Flight attendant unions were formed, beginning at United Airlines in the 1940s, to negotiate improvements in pay, benefits and working conditions.From Skygirl to Flight Attendant, Women and the Making of a Union by Georgia Panter Nielsen, ILR Press/Cornell, Ithaca, New York (1982) Those unions would later challenge what they perceived as sexist stereotypes and unfair work practices such as age limits, size limits, limitations on marriage, and prohibition of pregnancy. Many of these limitations have been lifted by judicial mandates. The largest flight attendants' union is the Association of Flight Attendants, representing nearly 60,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines within the US. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants represents the flight attendants of American Airlines, the world's largest carrier. APFA is the largest independent flight attendant union in the world. In the UK, cabin crew can be represented by either Cabin Crew '89, or the much larger and more powerful Transport and General Workers' Union. In Australia, flight attendants are represented by the Flight Attendants' Association of Australia (FAAA). There are two divisions: one for international crews (long-haul) and one for domestic crews (short-haul). In New Zealand, flight attendants can be represented by either the Flight Attendants and Related Services Association (FARSA) or by the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union (EPMU). In Canada, flight attendants are represented by either the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) or by the Canadian Flight Attendants Union (CFAU). =Discrimination= Originally female flight attendants were required to be single upon hiring, and were fired if they got married, exceeded weight regulations, or reached age 32 or 35 depending on the airline. In the 1970s the group Stewardesses for Women's Rights protested sexist advertising and company discrimination, and brought many cases to court. In 1964 United States President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law which prohibited sex discrimination and led to the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1968. The EEOC ruled that sex was not a bona fide occupational requirement to be a flight attendant. For stewardesses, this meant that they had an official governing body to report offences to and allowed them to successfully challenge age ceiling and marriage bans in relation to their effectiveness as employees. In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants‚Äô employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The restriction of hiring only women was lifted at all airlines in 1971 due to the decisive court case of Diaz vs. Pan Am. The no-marriage rule was eliminated throughout the US airline industry by the 1980s. The last such broad categorical discrimination, the weight restrictions, were relaxed in the 1990s through litigation and negotiations. By the end of the 1970s, the term stewardess had generally been replaced by the gender-neutral alternative flight attendant. More recently the term cabin crew or cabin staff has begun to replace 'flight attendants' in some parts of the world, because of the term's recognition of their role as members of the crew. Roles in emergencies Actions of flight attendants in emergencies have long been credited in saving lives; in the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other aviation authorities view flight attendants as essential for safety, and are thus usually required on Part 121 aircraft operations. Studies, some done in light of British Airtours Flight 28M, have concluded that assertive cabin crew are essential for the rapid evacuation of aeroplanes. Notable examples of cabin crew actions include: =September 11, 2001= The role of flight attendants received heightened prominence after the September 11 attacks when flight attendants (such as Sandra W. Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles of United Airlines Flight 93; Robert Fangman of United Airlines Flight 175; Renee May of American Airlines Flight 77; and Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney of American Airlines Flight 11) actively attempted to protect passengers from assault, and also provided vital information to air traffic controllers on the hijackings, as did many other passengers. In the wake of these attacks, many flight attendants at major airlines were laid off because of decreased passenger loads. =Other emergencies= * In April 1936, flight attendant Nellie Granger aided survivors after the crash of TWA Flight 1, then walked through a snowstorm to find help, before returning to the crash scene. * Senior Purser Neerja Bhanot saved the lives of passengers and crew when Pan Am Flight 73 was hijacked. She was killed while protecting children from the terrorists. After her death she received the Special Courage Award from the United States Department of Justice and India's highest civilian honor for bravery, the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration). * Naila Nazir, Pakistani flight attendant (employee of Pakistan International Airlines) who received 1985's Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Heroism Award for her brave handling of tense and dangerous situation during 13 days of flight PK-326 hijacking ordeal. * British Airtours Flight 28M, the two forward flight attendants, Arthur Bradbury and Joanna Toff, repeatedly crawled into the smoked filled and burning cabin to drag a number of passengers to safety, and were subsequently awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. The two rear flight attendants, Sharon Ford and Jacqui Ubanski, who opened the rear doors but were overwhelmed by fire and smoke were awarded the same medal posthumously. * Scandinavian Airlines Flight 751, when cabin crew recognised an emergency landing was imminent and commanded the passengers to \\"bend down ... hold your knees\\" to adopt the brace position. * Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529, whose sole flight attendant, Robin Fech, provided emergency briefings, brace and evacuation commands to the passengers when the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft sustained serious damage to one of its engines and crash landed. The NTSB accident report commended \\"the exemplary manner in which the flight attendant briefed the passengers and handled the emergency\\". * BOAC Flight 712, where a flight attendant, Barbara Jane Harrison died saving passengers from an on-board fire and was posthumously awarded the George Cross. * British Airways Flight 5390, in which a flight attendant was able to prevent a pilot from being lost through a cockpit window that had failed. * Southern Airways Flight 242, on which the cabin crew provided safety briefings to their passengers, and on their own initiative, warned passengers of the impending crash by commanding passengers to adopt the brace position. At least one flight attendant is known to have assisted in rescuing trapped passengers. * Air Florida Flight 90, in which Kelly Duncan, the lone surviving flight attendant, passed the only life vest she could find to another passenger. She is recognised in the NTSB report for this \\"unselfish act.\\" * TWA flight attendant Uli Derickson who protected passengers during the TWA Flight 847 hijacking by assisting with negotiation efforts. * TWA Flight 843, when a TWA Lockheed L-1011 aircraft crashed after an aborted takeoff in 1992. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. Nine flight attendants, along with five off-duty flight attendants, evacuated all 292 persons on board without loss of life. The NTSB in their after accident reported noted, \\"The performance of the flight attendants during the emergency was exceptional and probably contributed to the success of the emergency evacuation.\\" * On British Airways Flight 2069, cabin crew stopped the plane from being crashed by a mentally ill passenger. * Crew on American Airlines Flight 63 prevented shoe bomber Richard Colvin Reid from blowing up the plane. * Flight attendants on Qantas Flight 1737 prevented their plane from being hijacked by a passenger with mental health issues. Two of them were taken to hospital with stab wounds. * Aloha Airlines Flight 243 suffered a decompression which tore an section of fuselage away from the plane. The only fatality was flight attendant C.B. Lansing who was blown out of the airplane. Flight attendant Michelle Honda was thrown violently to the floor during the decompression but, despite her injuries, crawled up and down the aisle reassuring passengers. * Flight Attendants on Air Canada Flight 797 (Sergio Benetti, Judi Davidson, Laura Kayama) used procedures which were not specifically taught in training such as moving passengers to the front of the aircraft to move them away from the fire and smoke, and passing out towels for passengers to cover their nose and mouths with while the cabin was filling with smoke. Chief Flight Attendant Sergio Benetti was the first to open the front door of the aircraft, and escaped out that way, leaving all passengers and other crew behind. *USAir flight attendant Richard DeMary helped to evacuate surviving passengers and another crew member from the burning wreckage of USAir Flight 1016, which crashed during a go-around in adverse weather conditions after a failed landing attempt at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.https://web.archive.org/web/20060621010435/http://www.casa.gov.au/fsa/1998/nov/dc9crash.pdf * Flight Attendants on US Airways Flight 1549 successfully evacuated all passengers from the aircraft within 90 seconds despite the fact that the rear was rapidly filling with water. * Nine cabin crew members aboard Air France Flight 358 successfully evacuated the aircraft within 90 seconds after the A340-300 overran a runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport. The NTSB stated that the actions of the cabin crew contributed to the 100% survival rate. * The flight attendants of Philippine Airlines Flight 434 kept the passengers calm after a bomb exploded during the flight from Cebu to Tokyo. Though one passenger was killed during the explosion, they took care of the injured passengers. Some exception include Air Canada Flight 797, where the investigative Board found that the flight attendant in charge's \\"misleading\\" reports about the fire \\"influenced the captain's decision to delay the initiation of a descent\\" and that such \\"delay increased the time for the fire to propagate and the time that passengers were exposed to the toxic environment before the airplane could be evacuated.\\" The accident killed 23 passengers; none of the flight attendants sustained any injuries. Chief Flight Attendant Sergio Benetti was the first to open the front door of the aircraft, and escaped out that way, leaving all passengers and other crew behind.

They were originally part of the temple of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens. The collection is now on display in the British Museum, in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery. From 1801 to 1812, agents of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin removed about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Elgin Marbles, 2008, O.Ed. The Marbles were transported by sea to Britain. Elgin later claimed to have obtained in 1801 an official decree (a firman) from the Sublime Porte, the central government of the Ottoman Empire which were then the rulers of Greece. This firman has not been found in the Ottoman archives despite its wealth of documents from the same period and its veracity is disputed. The Acropolis Museum displays a proportion of the complete frieze, aligned in orientation and within sight of the Parthenon, with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to Athens. In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while some others, such as Lord Byron, likened the Earl's actions to vandalism or looting.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, The Acropolis, p.6/20, 2008, O.Ed.Mark Ellingham, Tim Salmon, Marc Dubin, Natania Jansz, John Fisher, Greece: The Rough Guide, Rough Guides, 1992,, p.39Chester Charlton McCown, The Ladder of Progress in Palestine: A Story of Archaeological Adventure, Harper & Bros., 1943, p.2Graham Huggan, Stephan Klasen, Perspectives on Endangerment, Georg Olms Verlag, 2005, , p.159 Following a public debate in Parliament and its subsequent exoneration of Elgin, he sold the Marbles to the British government in 1816. They were then passed to the British Museum, where they are now on display in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery. After gaining its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, the newly-founded Greek state began a series of projects to restore its monuments and retrieve looted art. It has expressed its disapproval of Elgin's removal of the Marbles from the Acropolis and the Parthenon, which is regarded as one of the world's greatest cultural monuments. International efforts to repatriate the Marbles to Greece were intensified in the 1980s by then Greek Minister of Culture Melina Mercouri, and there are now many organisations actively campaigning for the Marbles' return, several united as part of the International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures. The Greek government itself continues to urge the return of the marbles to Athens so as to be unified with the remaining marbles and for the complete Parthenon frieze sequence to be restored, through diplomatic, political and legal means. In 2014, UNESCO offered to mediate between Greece and the United Kingdom to resolve the dispute, although this was later turned down by the British Museum on the basis that UNESCO works with government bodies, not trustees of museums. Background Built in the ancient era, the Parthenon was extensively damaged by earthquakes. Also, during the Venetian-Turkish War (1683‚Äì1699) against the Ottoman Empire. The defending Turks fortified the Acropolis and used the Parthenon as a castle. On 26 September 1687, a Venetian artillery round, fired from the Hill of Philopappus, blew up the Parthenon, and the building was partly destroyed.Theodor E. Mommsen, The Venetians in Athens and the Destruction of the Parthenon in 1687, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 45, No. 4 (October ‚Äì December 1941), pp. 544‚Äì556 The explosion blew out the building's central portion and caused the cella's walls to crumble into rubble. Three of the four walls collapsed, or nearly so, and about three- fifths of the sculptures from the frieze fell. About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which showered marble fragments over a significant area. For the next century and a half, portions of the remaining structure were scavenged for building material and looted of any remaining objects of value. Acquisition Parthenon Selene Horse Metope from the Elgin marbles depicting a Centaur and a Lapith fighting Statuary from the east pediment Frise West, II, 2 In November 1798 the Earl of Elgin was appointed as \\"Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty to the Sublime Porte of Selim III, Sultan of Turkey\\" (Greece was then part of the Ottoman Empire). Before his departure to take up the post he had approached officials of the British government to inquire if they would be interested in employing artists to take casts and drawings of the sculptured portions of the Parthenon. According to Lord Elgin, \\"the answer of the Government ... was entirely negative.\\" Lord Elgin decided to carry out the work himself, and employed artists to take casts and drawings under the supervision of the Neapolitan court painter, Giovani Lusieri. According to a Turkish local, marble sculptures that fell were being burned to obtain lime for building. Although his original intention was only to document the sculptures, in 1801 Lord Elgin began to remove material from the Parthenon and its surrounding structures under the supervision of Lusieri. Pieces were also removed from the Erechtheion, the Propylaia, and the Temple of Athena Nike, all inside the Acropolis. The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost to Elgin of around ¬£70,000.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Elgin intended to use the marbles to decorate Broomhall House, his private home near Dunfermline in Scotland, but a costly divorce suit forced him to sell them to settle his debts.As reported by John E. Simmons in: Museums: A History, chapter 7, Rowman & Littlefield, 07.07.2016 - 326 pages Elgin sold the Parthenon Marbles to the British government for less than it cost him to procure them, declining higher offers from other potential buyers, including Napoleon. Description The Parthenon Marbles acquired by Elgin include some 21 figures from the statuary from the east and west pediments, 15 of an original 92 metope panels depicting battles between the Lapiths and the Centaurs, as well as 75 metres of the Parthenon Frieze which decorated the horizontal course set above the interior architrave of the temple. As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon. Elgin's acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the Athenian Acropolis: a Caryatid from Erechtheum; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the Temple of Athena Nike; and a number of other architectural fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, the Temple of Athene Nike, and the Treasury of Atreus. Legality of the removal from Athens The Acropolis was at that time an Ottoman military fort, so Elgin required special permission to enter the site, the Parthenon, and the surrounding buildings. He stated that he had obtained a firman from the Sultan which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an Italian copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, US, 3 edition (1998) Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that \\"any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman\\". The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. 'The committee permission' had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that firmans, being official decrees by the Sultan, were meticulously recorded as a matter of procedure, and that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period. The parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. Philip Hunt. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and \\"vouches for the accuracy of the English translation\\". The committee report states on page 69 \\"(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan\\" - however, the document presented to the committee was \\"an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original firman\\", and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair. The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, Lord Elgin and the Marbles, stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon. The study judged a clause authorising the British to take stones ‚Äúwith old inscriptions and figures‚Äù probably meant items in the excavations the site, not the art decorating the temples. The document allowed Elgin and his team to erect scaffolding so as to make drawings and mouldings in chalk or gypsum, as well as to measure the remains of the ruined buildings and excavate the foundations which may have become covered in the [ghiaja (meaning gravel, debris)]; and \\"...that when they wish to take away [qualche (meaning 'some' or 'a few')] pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon, that no opposition be made thereto\\". The interpretation of these lines has been questioned even by non-restitutionalists,English translation of the firman particularly the word qualche, which in modern language should be translated as a few but can also mean any. According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from Piraeus. Many have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor David Rudenstine of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, \\"is certainly not established and may well be false\\". Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads \\"We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador\\" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is \\"We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.\\". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of \\"Mr. Philip Hunt\\" with the initials \\"N.N.\\" can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, \\"Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens\\". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had \\"retained none of them.\\" Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was \\"Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted [to Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?\\" to which Hunt answered \\"yes\\", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document. English travel writer Edward Daniel Clarke, an eyewitness, wrote that the Dizdar, the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue. In contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and also Professor of Art at Stanford University, putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. Sultan Selim III was grateful to the British for repelling Napoleonic expansion, and unlike his ancestor Mehmet II, the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him. Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles. He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles \\"is at best ambiguous\\", adding that the document \\"provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon ... The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects\\". The issue of firmans of this nature, along with universally required bribes, was not unusual at this time: In 1801 for example, Edward Clarke and his assistant John Marten Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens for the removal of a statue of the goddess Demeter which was at Eleusis, with the intervention of Italian artist Giovanni Battista Lusieri who was Lord Elgin's assistant at the time. Prior to Clarke, the statue had been discovered in 1676 by the traveller George Wheler, and since then several ambassadors had submitted unsuccessful applications for its removal, but Clarke had been the one to remove the statue by force, after bribing the waiwode of Athens and obtaining a firman, despite the objections and a riot, of the local population who unofficially, and against the traditions of the iconoclastic Church, worshiped the statue as the uncanonised Saint Demetra (Greek: ŒëŒ≥ŒØŒ± ŒîŒÆŒºŒ∑œÑœÅŒ±). The people would adorn the statue with garlands, and believed that the goddess was able to bring fertility to their fields and that the removal of the statue would cause that benefit to disappear. Clarke also removed other marbles from Greece such as a statue of Pan, a figure of Eros, a comic mask, various reliefs and funerary steles, amongst others. Clarke donated these to the University of Cambridge and subsequently in 1803 the statue of Demeter was displayed at the university library. The collection was later moved to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge where it formed one of the two main collections of the institution. Contemporary reaction The contemporary museum director in the Louvre had no doubt around the legality of the acquisition of Lord Elgin. During the art restitutions of post-napoleonic France to other European States, Vivant Denon, then director of former Musee Napoleon then Louvre, wrote in a private letter to the French ambassador Talleyrand who was then engaged in the Congress of Vienna: \\"If we yield to the claims (for art restitution) of Holland and Belgium, we deprive the Museum of one of its greatest assets, that of having a series of excellent colorists... Russia is not hostile, Austria has had everything returned, Prussia has a restoration more complete.... There remains only England, who has in truth nothing to claim, but who, since she has just bought the bas-reliefs of which Lord Elgin plundered the Temple at Athens, now thinks she can become a rival of the Museum [Louvre], and wants to deplete this Museum in order to collect the remains for her\\" (Denon to Talleyrand, quoted in Saunier, p. 114; Muintz, in Nouvelle Rev., CVII, 2OI). Vivant Denon uses clearly the verb \\"plunder\\" in French. A portrait depicting the Parthenon Marbles in a temporary Elgin Room at the British Museum surrounded by museum staff, a trustee and visitors, 1819 When the marbles were shipped to England, they were \\"an instant success among many\\" who admired the sculptures and supported their arrival, but both the sculptures and Elgin also received criticism from detractors. Lord Elgin began negotiations for the sale of the collection to the British Museum in 1811, but negotiations failed despite the support of British artists after the government showed little interest. Many Britons opposed purchase of the statues because they were in bad condition and therefore did not display the \\"ideal beauty\\" found in other sculpture collections. The following years marked an increased interest in classical Greece, and in June 1816, after parliamentary hearings, the House of Commons offered ¬£35,000 in exchange for the sculptures. Even at the time the acquisition inspired much debate, although it was supported by \\"many persuasive calls\\" for the purchase. Lord Byron strongly objected to the removal of the marbles from Greece, denouncing Elgin as a vandal. His point of view about the removal of the Marbles from Athens is also mentioned in his narrative poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, published in 1812, which itself was largely inspired by Byron's travels around the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea between 1809 and 1811: > Dull is the eye that will not weep to see Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering > shrines removed By British hands, which it had best behoved To guard those > relics ne'er to be restored. Curst be the hour when from their isle they > roved, And once again thy hapless bosom gored, And snatch'd thy shrinking > gods to northern climes abhorred! Byron was not the only one to protest against the removal at the time. Sir John Newport said: Edward Daniel Clarke witnessed the removal of the metopes and called the action a \\"spoliation\\", writing that \\"thus the form of the temple has sustained a greater injury than it had already experienced from the Venetian artillery,\\" and that \\"neither was there a workman employed in the undertaking ... who did not express his concern that such havoc should be deemed necessary, after moulds and casts had been already made of all the sculpture which it was designed to remove.\\" When Sir Francis Ronalds visited Athens and Giovanni Battista Lusieri in 1820, he wrote that \\"If Lord Elgin had possessed real taste in lieu of a covetous spirit he would have done just the reverse of what he has, he would have removed the rubbish and left the antiquities.\\" A parliamentary committee investigating the situation concluded that the monuments were best given \\"asylum\\" under a \\"free government\\" such as the British one. In 1810, Elgin published a defence of his actions, but the subject remained controversial. A public debate in Parliament followed Elgin's publication, and Parliament again exonerated Elgin's actions, eventually deciding to purchase the marbles for the \\"British nation\\" in 1816 by a vote of 82‚Äì30. Among the supporters of Elgin was the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon. He was followed by Felicia Hemans in her Modern Greece: A Poem (1817), who there took direct issue with Byron, defying him with the question > And who may grieve that, rescued from their hands, Spoilers of excellence > and foes of art, Thy relics, Athens! borne to other lands Claim homage still > to thee from every heart? and quoting Haydon and other defenders of their accessability in her notes.Modern Greece, London 1817, p.45, 65-6 John Keats visited the British Museum in 1817 and recording his feelings in the sonnet titled \\"On Seeing the Elgin Marbles\\". William Wordsworth also viewed the marbles and commented favourably on their aesthetics in a letter to Haydon. Following the exhibition of the marbles in the British Museum, they were later displayed in the specially constructed Elgin Saloon (1832) until the Duveen Gallery was completed in 1939. The crowds packing in to view them set attendance records for the museum. Damage =Morosini= East Pediment Prior damage to the marbles was sustained during successive wars, and it was during such conflicts that the Parthenon and its artwork sustained, by far, the most extensive damage. In particular, an explosion ignited by Venetian gun and cannon-fire bombardment in 1687, whilst the Parthenon was used as a munitions store during the Ottoman rule, destroyed or damaged many pieces of Parthenon art, including some of that later taken by Lord Elgin. It was this explosion that sent the marble roof, most of the cella walls, 14 columns from the north and south peristyles, and carved metopes and frieze blocks flying and crashing to the ground, destroying much of the artwork. Further damage to the Parthenon's artwork occurred when the Venetian general Francesco Morosini looted the site of its larger sculptures. The tackle he was using to remove the sculptures proved to be faulty and snapped, dropping an over-life-sized sculpture of Poseidon and the horses of Athena's chariot from the west pediment on to the rock of the Acropolis below. =War of Independence= The Erechtheion was used as a munitions store by the Ottomans during the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1833) which ended the 355-year Ottoman rule of Athens. The Acropolis was besieged twice during the war, first by the Greeks in 1821‚Äì22 and then by the Ottoman forces in 1826‚Äì27. During the first siege the besieged Ottoman forces attempted to melt the lead in the columns to cast bullets, even prompting the Greeks to offer their own bullets to the Ottomans in order to minimize damage.Hitchens Christopher, The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece?, 1998, p.viii, =Elgin= Elgin consulted with Italian sculptor Antonio Canova in 1803 about how best to restore the marbles. Canova was considered by some to be the world's best sculptural restorer of the time; Elgin wrote that Canova declined to work on the marbles for fear of damaging them further. To facilitate transport by Elgin, the columns' capitals and many metopes and frieze slabs were either hacked off the main structure or sawn and sliced into smaller sections, causing irreparable damage to the Parthenon itself.Where Gods Yearn for Long-Lost Treasures , The New York Times One shipload of marbles on board the British brig Mentor was caught in a storm off Cape Matapan in southern Greece and sank near Kythera, but was salvaged at the Earl's personal expense; it took two years to bring them to the surface. =British Museum= Oddy, Andrew, Andrew Oddy The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975 , 47(3). The artefacts held in London suffered from 19th-century pollution which persisted until the mid-20th century and have suffered irreparable damage by previous cleaning methods employed by British Museum staff.Oddy, Andrew, \\"The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975\\", in Studies in Conservation, vol. 47, no. 3, (2002), pp. 145‚Äì146, Quote: \\"However, for a short time in the late 1930s copper scrapers were used to remove areas of discolouration from the surface of the Elgin Marbles. New information is presented about this lamentable episode.\\" As early as 1838, scientist Michael Faraday was asked to provide a solution to the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles. The outcome is described in the following excerpt from the letter he sent to Henry Milman, a commissioner for the National Gallery.Oddy, Andrew, \\"The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975\\", in Studies in Conservation, vol. 47, no. 3, (2002), p. 146Jenkins, I., '\\"Sir, they are scrubbing the Elgin Marbles!\\" ‚Äì some controversial cleanings of the Parthenon Sculptures', Minerva 10(6) (1999) 43‚Äì45. > The marbles generally were very dirty ... from a deposit of dust and soot. > ...

A further effort to clean the marbles ensued in 1858. Richard Westmacott, who was appointed superintendent of the \\"moving and cleaning the sculptures\\" in 1857, in a letter approved by the British Museum Standing Committee on 13 March 1858 concludedOddy, Andrew, \\"The Conservation of Marble Sculptures in the British Museum before 1975\\", in Studies in Conservation, vol. 47, no. 3, (2002), p. 148 > I think it my duty to say that some of the works are much damaged by > ignorant or careless moulding ‚Äì with oil and lard ‚Äì and by restorations in > wax and resin.

Yet another effort to clean the marbles occurred in 1937‚Äì38. This time the incentive was provided by the construction of a new Gallery to house the collection.

The British Museum has responded with the statement that \\"mistakes were made at that time.\\"mistakes were made at that time , The Guardian. On another occasion it was said that \\"the damage had been exaggerated for political reasons\\" and that \\"the Greeks were guilty of excessive cleaning of the marbles before they were brought to Britain.\\" During the international symposium on the cleaning of the marbles, organised by the British Museum in 1999, curator Ian Jenkins, deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that \\"The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up\\". Nonetheless, he claimed that the prime cause for the damage inflicted upon the marbles was the 2000-year-long weathering on the Acropolis. American archeologist Dorothy King, in a newspaper article, wrote that techniques similar to the ones used in 1937‚Äì38 were applied by Greeks as well in more recent decades than the British, and maintained that Italians still find them acceptable. The British Museum said that a similar cleaning of the Temple of Hephaestus in the Athenian Agora was carried out by the conservation team of the American School of Classical Studies at AthensJ. M. Cook and John Boardman, \\"Archaeology in Greece, 1953\\", The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 74, (1954), p. 147 in 1953 using steel chisels and brass wire. According to the Greek ministry of Culture, the cleaning was carefully limited to surface salt crusts. The 1953 American report concluded that the techniques applied were aimed at removing the black deposit formed by rain-water and \\"brought out the high technical quality of the carving\\" revealing at the same time \\"a few surviving particles of colour\\".

This includes an incident in 1961 when two schoolboys knocked off a part of a centaur's leg. In June 1981, a west pediment figure was slightly chipped by a falling glass skylight, and in 1966 four shallow lines were scratched on the back of one of the figures by vandals. In 1970 letters were scratched on to the upper right thigh of another figure.

Until cleaning of the remaining marbles was completed in 2005, black crusts and coatings were present on the marble surface. The laser technique applied on the 14 slabs that Elgin did not remove revealed a surprising array of original details, such as the original chisel marks and the veins on the horses' bellies. Similar features in the British Museum collection have been scraped and scrubbed with chisels to make the marbles look white. Between January 20 and the end of March 2008, 4200 items (sculptures, inscriptions small terracotta objects), including some 80 artefacts dismantled from the monuments in recent years, were removed from the old museum on the Acropolis to the new Parthenon Museum. Natural disasters have also affected the Parthenon. In 1981, an earthquake caused damage to the east fa√ßade. Since 1975, Greece has been restoring the Acropolis. This restoration has included replacing the thousands of rusting iron clamps and supports that had previously been used, with non-corrosive titanium rods;Smith, Helena.

Retrieved 6 March 2010. removing surviving artwork from the building into storage and subsequently into a new museum built specifically for the display of the Parthenon art; and replacing the artwork with high-quality replicas. This process has come under fire from some groups as some buildings have been completely dismantled, including the dismantling of the Temple of Athena Nike and for the unsightly nature of the site due to the necessary cranes and scaffolding. But the hope is to restore the site to some of its former glory, which may take another 20 years and 70 million euros, though the prospect of the Acropolis being \\"able to withstand the most extreme weather conditions ‚Äì earthquakes\\" is \\"little consolation to the tourists visiting the Acropolis\\" according to The Guardian. Under continuous international pressure, Directors of the British Museum have not ruled out agreeing to what they call a \\"temporary\\" loan to the new museum, but state that it would be under the condition of Greece acknowledging the British Museum's claims to ownership. Relocation debate =Rationale for returning to Athens= Those arguing for the Marbles' return claim legal, moral and artistic grounds. Their arguments include: * The main stated aim of the Greek campaign is to reunite the Parthenon sculptures around the world in order to restore \\"organic elements\\" which \\"at present remain without cohesion, homogeneity and historicity of the monument to which they belong\\" and allow visitors to better appreciate them as a whole;Nicoletta Divari-Valakou, (Director of the Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities of Athens), \\"Revisiting the Parthenon: National Heritage in the Age of Globalism\\" in Mille Gabriel & Jens Dahl, (eds.)

Utimut : past heritage ‚Äì future partnerships, discussions on repatriation in the 21st Century, Copenhagen : International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs and Greenland National Museum & Archives, (2008) passim; (see also Conference summary ) * Safekeeping of the marbles would be ensured at the New Acropolis Museum, situated to the south of the Acropolis hill. It was built to hold the Parthenon sculpture in natural sunlight that characterises the Athenian climate, arranged in the same way as they would have been on the Parthenon. The museum's facilities have been equipped with state-of-the-art technology for the protection and preservation of exhibits; * The friezes are part of a single work of art, thus it was unintended that fragments of this piece be scattered across different locations; * Casts of the marbles would be just as able to demonstrate the cultural influences which Greek sculptures have had upon European art as would the original marbles, whereas the context with which the marbles belong cannot be replicated within the British Museum; * A poll suggested that more British people (37%) supported the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%) * The conservation claims made by British authorities over the time Parthenon Marbles have been kept at the British Museum seem controversial, if compared to contemporary British expeditions carried out in other parts of the Greek world. In 1823, British architects Samuel Angell and William Harris excavated at Selinus in the course of their tour of Sicily, and came upon the sculptured metopes from the Archaic temple of ‚ÄúTemple C.‚Äù Although local Bourbon officials tried to stop them, they continued their work, and attempted to export their finds to England, destined for the British Museum. Now in the echos of the activities of Lord Elgin in Athens, Angell and Harris‚Äôs shipments were diverted to Palermo by force of the Bourbon authorities and are now kept in the Palermo archeological museum. In a 2018 interview to the Athens newspaper Ta Nea, British Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn did not rule out returning the Marbles to Greece, stating, \\"As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession‚Äîincluding artefacts looted from other countries in the past‚Äîwe should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures.\\" =Rationale for remaining in London= A range of different arguments have been presented by scholars, British political leaders and British Museum spokespersons over the years in defence of retention of the Parthenon Marbles by the British Museum. The main points include: * The assertion that fulfilling all restitution claims would empty most of the world's great museums ‚Äì this has also caused concerns among other European and American museums, with one potential target being the famous bust of Nefertiti in Berlin's Neues Museum; in addition, portions of Parthenon marbles are kept by many other European museums. Advocates of the British Museum's position also point out that the Marbles in Britain receive about 6 million visitors per year as opposed to 1.5 million visitors to the Acropolis Museum. The removal of the Marbles to Greece would therefore, they argue, significantly reduce the number of people who have the opportunity to visit the Marbles. The English Romantic poet John Keats, and the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, are notable examples of visitors to the Parthenon Marbles after their removal to England who subsequently produced famous work inspired by them. * The assertion that Modern Greeks have \\"no claim to the stones because you could see from their physiognomy that they were not descended from the men who had carved them,\\" a quote attributed to Auberon Waugh. In nineteenth century Western Europe, Greeks of the Classical period were widely imagined to have been light skinned and blond.Dream Nation: Enlightenment, Colonization, and the Institution of Modern Greece, Stathis Gourgouris p.142-143 * The assertion that Greece could mount no court case, because Elgin claims to have been granted permission by what was then Greece's ruling government and a legal principle of limitation would apply, i.e., the ability to pursue claims expires after a period of time prescribed by law. The last was tested in the English High Court in May 2005 in relation to Nazi-looted Old Master artworks held at the British Museum, which the Museum's Trustees wished to return to the family of the original owner; the Court found that due to the British Museum Act 1963 these works could not be returned without further legislation. The judge, Mr Justice Morritt, found that the Act, which protects the collections for posterity, could not be overridden by a \\"moral obligation\\" to return works, even if they are believed to have been plundered.Ruling tightens grip on Parthenon marbles , The Guardian, 27 May 2005. Retrieved 5 March 2010.Her Majesty's Attorney General v The Trustees of the British Museum, [2005] EWHC (Ch) 1089 It has been argued, however, that the case was not directly relevant to the Parthenon Marbles, as it was about a transfer of ownership, and not the loan of artefacts for public exhibition overseas, which is provided for in the 1963 Act. Another argument for keeping the Parthenon Marbles within the UK has been made by J. H. Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at Stanford University and co-operating professor in the Stanford Art Department. He has argued that the Marbles are now established as a significant element of Britain's own cultural history, as \\"the Elgin Marbles have been in England since 1821 and in that time have become a part of the British cultural heritage.\\" He has also argued that if the Parthenon were actually being restored, there would be a moral argument for returning the Marbles to the temple whence they came, and thus restoring its integrity. The Guardian has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon. However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. These arguments are perhaps complicated a little by the completion of the new Acropolis Museum in 2009, where the half not removed by Elgin is now displayed, aligned in orientation and within sight of the Parthenon, with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to Athens. The Trustees of the British Museum make the following statement on the Museum website in response to arguments for the relocation of the Parthenon Marbles to the Acropolis Museum: \\"The Acropolis Museum allows the Parthenon sculptures that are in Athens to be appreciated against the backdrop of ancient Greek and Athenian history. This display does not alter the Trustees‚Äô view that the sculptures are part of everyone‚Äôs shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries. The Trustees remain convinced that the current division allows different and complementary stories to be told about the surviving sculptures, highlighting their significance for world culture and affirming the universal legacy of ancient Greece.\\" Public perception of the issue =Popular support for restitution= Outside Greece a campaign for the Return of the Marbles began in 1981 with the formation of the International Organising Committee - Australia - for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles, and in 1983 with the formation of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles. International organisations such as UNESCO and the International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures, as well as campaign groups such as, Marbles Reunited, and stars of Hollywood, such as George Clooney and Matt Damon, as well as Human Rights activists, lawyers, and the people of the arts, voiced their strong support for the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece. American actor George Clooney voiced his support for the return by the United Kingdom and reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece, during his promotional campaign for his 2014 film The Monuments Men which retells the story of Allied efforts to save important masterpieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler and the Nazis during World War II. His remarks regarding the Marbles reignited the debate in the United Kingdom about their return to their home country. Public polls were also carried out by newspapers in response to Clooney's stance on this matter. An internet campaign site, in part sponsored by Metaxa, aims to consolidate support for the return of the Parthenon Marbles to the New Acropolis Museum in Athens. Noted public intellectual Christopher Hitchens had, at numerous times, argued for their repatriation. In BBC TV Series QI (series 12, episode 7, XL edition), host Stephen Fry provided his support for the return of the Parthenon Marbles while recounting the story of the Greeks giving lead shot to their Ottoman Empire enemies, as the Ottomans were running out of ammunition, in order to prevent damage to the Acropolis. Fry had previously written a blog post along much the same lines in December 2011 entitled \\"A Modest Proposal\\", signing off with \\"It's time we lost our marbles\\". =Opinion polls= A YouGov poll in 2014 suggested that more British people (37%) supported the marbles' restoration to Greece than opposed it (23%). In older polls, Ipsos MORI asked in 1998, \\"If there were a referendum on whether or not the Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece, how would you vote?\\" This returned these values from the British general adult population: *40% in favour of returning the marbles to Greece *15% in favour of keeping them at the British Museum *18% would not vote *27% had no opinion Another opinion poll in 2002 (again carried out by MORI) showed similar results, with 40% of the British public in favour of returning the marbles to Greece, 16% in favour of keeping them within Britain and the remainder either having no opinion or would not vote. When asked how they would vote if a number of conditions were met (including, but not limited to, a long-term loan whereby the British maintained ownership and joint control over maintenance) the number responding in favour of return increased to 56% and those in favour of keeping them dropped to 7%. Both MORI poll results have been characterised by proponents of the return of the Marbles to Greece as representing a groundswell of public opinion supporting return, since the proportion explicitly supporting return to Greece significantly exceeds the number who are explicitly in favour of keeping the Marbles at the British Museum. Other displaced Parthenon art Sculpture of Dionysos from the Parthenon's East Pediment The remainder of the surviving sculptures that are not in museums or storerooms in Athens are held in museums in various locations across Europe. The British Museum also holds additional fragments from the Parthenon sculptures acquired from various collections that have no connection with Lord Elgin. The collection held in the British Museum includes the following material from the Acropolis: *Parthenon: of the original frieze **15 of the 92 metopes **17 pedimental figures, including a figure of a river-god, possibly the river Ilissos; **various pieces of architecture *Erechtheion: a Caryatid, a column and other architectural members *Propylaia: Architectural members *Temple of Athena Nike: 4 slabs of the frieze and architectural members British Museum loan The British Museum lent the figure of a river-god, possibly the river Ilissos, to the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg to celebrate its 250th anniversary. It was on display there from Saturday 6 December 2014 until Sunday 18 January 2015. This was the first time the British Museum had lent part of its Parthenon Marbles collection and it caused considerable controversy.

Early life and career A member of the formerly royal house of Bruce, Elgin was born at the family seat, Broomhall House, Fife, the second son of Charles Bruce, 5th Earl of Elgin and his wife Martha Whyte. He succeeded his older brother William Robert, the 6th Earl, in 1771 when he was only five. He was educated at Harrow and Westminster, and studied at St Andrews and Paris.

Although he formally remained a representative peer until 1840, shortly before his death, he took almost no part in Parliament after 1807. = Diplomatic career = In 1791, he was sent as a temporary envoy-extraordinary to Austria, while Sir Robert Keith was ill.

After spending time in Britain, he was sent as envoy-extraordinary to Prussia in 1795.London Gazette, 13804, 11 August 1795, 836 Elgin was appointed as ambassador to The Porte in December 1798. On 11 March 1799, shortly before setting off to serve as ambassador at Constantinople, Elgin married Mary, daughter and heiress of William Hamilton Nisbet, of Dirleton; Elgin finally arrived at Constantinople on 6 November 1799. He was ambassador to the Ottoman Empire between 1799 and 1803; he showed considerable skill and energy in fulfilling a difficult mission, the extension of British influence during the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and France.Christopher Hitchens, The Elgin Marbles: Should They Be Returned to Greece?, 1998, p.p.10-11 He departed Turkey at last on 16 January 1803. Elgin's controversial removal of the Parthenon Marbles Acting on the advice of Sir William Hamilton, he procured the services of the Neapolitan painter, Lusieri, and of several skilful draughtsmen and modellers. These artists were dispatched to Athens in the summer of 1800, and were principally employed in making drawings of the ancient monuments, though very limited facilities were given them by the authorities. Elgin later claimed that about the middle of the summer of 1801, he had received a firman from the Porte which allowed his lordship's agents not only to \\"fix scaffolding round the ancient Temple of the Idols [the Parthenon], and to mould the ornamental sculpture and visible figures thereon in plaster and gypsum,\\" but also \\"to take away any pieces of stone with old inscriptions or figures thereon.\\" This firman has not been found in the Ottoman archives despite its wealth of documents from the same period and its veracity is disputed. The half not removed by Elgin is now displayed in the Acropolis Museum, aligned in orientation and within sight of the Parthenon, with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to Athens. It was claimed later that the actual removal of ancient marbles from Athens formed no part of Elgin's first plan. The collection thus formed by operations at Athens, and by explorations in other parts of Greece, and now known by the name of the \\"Elgin Marbles\\", consists of portions of the frieze, metopes, and pedimental sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as of sculptured slabs from the Athenian temple of Nike Apteros, and of various antiquities from Attica and other districts of Hellas. Part of the Elgin collection was prepared for embarkation for England in 1803, and considerable difficulties were encountered at every stage of its transit. Elgin's vessel, the Mentor, wrecked near Cerigo with its cargo of marbles, and it was not till after the labours of three years, and the expenditure of a large sum of money, that the marbles were successfully recovered by the divers. On Elgin's departure from Turkey in 1803, he withdrew all his artists from Athens with the exception of Lusieri, who remained to direct the excavations which were still carried on, though on a much reduced scale. Additions continued to be made to the Elgin collections, and as late as 1812, eighty fresh cases of antiquities arrived in England. It was claimed later that the removal of about half of the frieze metopes, frieze and pedimental sculpture was a decision taken on the spot by Philip Hunt, Elgin's chaplain (and temporary private secretary, i.e. representative, in Athens). Under unclear circumstances, Elgin's agents were able to remove about half of the Parthenon frieze, fifteen metopes, and seventeen pedimental fragments, in addition to a caryatid and a column from the Erechtheion. The marbles remaining in Athens are generally considered to be in better condition than those removed by Elgin's agents. Elgin's removal of the marbles was censured by some as vandalism, most famously Lord Byron. Elgin attempted to vindicate himself in a pamphlet Memorandum on the Subject of the Earl of Elgin's Pursuits in Greece, published in 1810. The DNB is described in the last paragraph of this article. On the recommendation of a British parliamentary committee, which also \\"vindicated\\" their compatriot Elgin's conduct, the Marbles were \\"bought\\" by Great Britain in 1816 for ¬£35,000, considerably below their cost to Elgin (estimated at ¬£75,000), and deposited in the British Museum, where they remain for now. Internationally, the acquisition of the marbles continues to be widely seen as both illegal and immoral, although there still exist people who support Elgin's act, mostly in Britain. Polls indicate that even in the United Kingdom, a majority of people support the Marbles' return to Athens. The marbles taken to Britain by Elgin were further damaged while in the British museum by British schoolboysHastings, Chris.

Those marbles which were not taken from Athens were not subject to this damage are generally considered to be better preserved. Later career Elgin, who had been \\"detained\\" in France after the rupture of the peace of Amiens, returned to Britain in 1806. Finding that he could not get the British Museum to pay what he was asking for the marbles, Elgin sued his wife's lover for an appropriately high sum. He divorced Mary, for adultery, by legal actions in 1807 and 1808 in the English and Scottish courts‚Äîand by act of parliament‚Äîwhich caused much public scandal. Then, on 21 September 1810, he married Elizabeth (1790‚Äì1860), youngest daughter of James Townsend Oswald of Dunnikier. Elgin moved to the European continent. During 1815 Elgin became embroiled in the Tweddell remains affair, a controversy over the possessions of John Tweddell, a classical scholar who had died in 1799 in Athens and Elgin was accused of having appropriated Tweddell's belongings after his death, during his term as British ambassador in Constantinople. The full extent of the items were never recovered and their fate is unknown, but the matter was settled in late 1816 with the return of some of the items to Tweddell's family. Family Mary, Countess of Elgin Elgin married twice. On 11 March 1799, he married Mary (1778‚Äì1855), only child of William Hamilton Nisbet, of Dirleton.

Beaded necklace using silver-plated wire It can range from simply sliding a single bead onto any thread-like medium (string, silk thread, leather thong, thin wire, multi- stranded beading wire, or a soft, flexible wire) to complex creations that have multiple strands or interwoven levels. The choice of stringing medium can be an important point in the overall design, since string-type mediums might be subject to unwanted stretching if the weight of the beads is considerable. Similarly, certain bead types with sharp edges, such as hollow metal beads or some varieties of stone or glass, might abrade the string and cause the strand to eventually break. The simplest design is a single bead centered as a focal point on the string medium. The ends of the string can be simply knotted together or components of a clasp may be attached to each end. Next in complexity would be stringing multiple beads onto a single strand. Here alone are numerous opportunities for adding elements to the design concept. All the beads might be identical. The beads might be varied (in shape, color, type or any combination thereof) and used either in a random assortment or in a deliberate repeating pattern. Items not strictly defined as beads, such as pendants or \\"drops\\", might be placed within the strand to serve as focal points or accent elements in the design. Knotting is a next level of proficiency in creating strands. Here the stringing medium (traditionally silk thread or another similar, synthetic medium) has knots tied into it as a means of separating the individual beads from each other. The traditional strand of pearls is a well-known example of this technique. Pearls are threaded onto silk, and a knot is tied between each one to not only space them for greater individual prominence but to also keep them from rubbing directly against each other and risking the abrasion of the nacre that gives them their luster. This classic design can be varied by adding or using other varieties of beads or varying the number and placement of knots used. Multiple strands can be created using either the simple stringing or the knotting technique. Here, depending on the overall design, more planning may be called for. If the bead pattern is random, the only concern is that one strand be sized shorter than the next, so they will all lie flat and not interfere with each other when worn or displayed. However, if a specific repeating pattern is planned, then careful planning will be required so that the placement of matching portions of the pattern between the strands is aligned properly. A beading board, generally a flat panel with measured curved indentations in several staggered lengths, is a useful tool for spacing the beads to work out the desired pattern. Once the design has been worked out, joining the strands together might require special multiple-strand clasp fixtures unless there is a single knotting point or specific design element that will accommodate it. There is another way of using the smallest size of beads which is naive and in Pakistan it is called Motikaari (an Urdu word for \\"beadwork\\"). It is a medium for artistic expression e.g. calligraphy or portraiture by arranging patterns of smallest size of beads of different textures and hues in the length of adjoined strings. Motikaari is a craft as well as an art. The craftsperson/artist who work on motikaari is called 'Motikaar'. The method of making a pattern involves three stages. The first stage in this art form is to prepare a desired pattern on paper. Then it is pasted on a flat panel hardboard sheet. Preparation of hardboard sheet is the second important stage of the work. In the third stage, the beads of different colors are strung together according to the sketched pattern into the thread with the help of needle in the form of independent but parallel columns of strings. (This method discovered by Motikaar Malik Nisar Ahmed of Pakistan is the simplest and easiest so far. Malik Nisar Ahmed claimed to be the creator of this form of bead stringing as he made countless items of Motikaari compared to anybody else in the world. He is the member of Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA).) https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/116250-pioneer- of-%E2%80%98motikaari%E2%80%99-eyes-more-wonders Describing Motikaari Finally, after the consummation of the artistic pattern, it is removed from the hardboard so that it can be displayed in the shape of hanging strings of beads. Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail wire is the most common.

His poems in general are philosophical and abstract, but often evoke various landscapes. Biography Davie was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, a son of Baptist parents. He began his education at Barnsley Holgate Grammar School, and he later attended St Catharine's College, Cambridge. His studies there were interrupted by service during the war in the Royal Navy in Arctic Russia, where he taught himself the language. In the last year of the war, in Devon, he married Doreen John.Schmidt, Michael: Lives of the Poets, p. 727. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007.Schmidt, Michael: The Great Modern Poets, p. 149. Quercus, 2006. He returned to Cambridge in 1946 and received his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. In 1964 was made the first Professor of English at the new University of Essex. He taught English at the University of Essex from 1964 until 1968, when he moved to Stanford University, where he succeeded Yvor Winters. In 1978, he relocated to Vanderbilt University, where he taught until his retirement in 1988. He often wrote on the technique of poetry, both in books such as Purity of Diction in English Verse, and in smaller articles such as \\"Some Notes on Rhythm in Verse\\". Davie's criticism and poetry are both characterized by his interest in modernist and pre-modernist techniques. Davie argued that \\"there is no necessary connection between the poetic vocation on the one hand, and on the other exhibitionism, egoism, and licence\\".Schmidt, Michael: The Great Modern Poets, p. 149. Quercus, 2006. He writes eloquently and sympathetically about British modernist poetry in Under Briggflatts, while in Thomas Hardy and British Poetry he defends a pre-modernist verse tradition. Much of Davie's poetry has been compared to that of the traditionalist Philip Larkin, but other works are more influenced by Ezra Pound. He is featured in the Oxford Book of Contemporary Verse (1980). Irish literary critic Denis Donoghue described Davie's poetry as \\"an enforced choice between masturbation and happily wedded love\\" bereft of drama.Donoghue, Denis. \\"Ten Poets\\" (review of the 1985 collection Selected Poems by Donald Davie) in London Review of Books 7:19 (7 November 1985), 20‚Äì22. Writer Calvin Bedient discusses Davie's style in his book Eight Contemporary Poets. He informs readers of Davie's specific thoughts by including quotes. According to Bedient, Davie said that \\"To make poetry out of moral commonplace, a poet has to make it clear that he speaks not in his own voice (that would be impertinent) but as the spokesman of a social tradition.\\" It follows that Davie's voice is unique compared to the modern movement that was happening during his life. His work does not epitomize contemporary poetry like that of many of his counterparts, but rather it calls upon a certain nostalgia for the past. Davie's work is distinctly \\"English\\" sounding, as he uses English phrases and traditional language. In particular, his work often reminds readers of the late Augustan poets, whose work is sophisticated and polished. His writes in a similar style to Philip Larkin and Ted Hughes, who were both alive during Davie's lifetime. In addition, Davie writes without fear of criticism. He uses a strong and confident voice to assert his thoughts and musings.

Mathematical physics refers to the development of mathematical methods for application to problems in physics. The Journal of Mathematical Physics defines the field as \\"the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories\\".Definition from the Journal of Mathematical Physics.  Scope  There are several distinct branches of mathematical physics, and these roughly correspond to particular historical periods. = Classical mechanics = The rigorous, abstract and advanced reformulation of Newtonian mechanics adopting the Lagrangian mechanics and the Hamiltonian mechanics even in the presence of constraints. Both formulations are embodied in analytical mechanics and lead to understanding the deep interplay of the notions of symmetry and conserved quantities during the dynamical evolution, as embodied within the most elementary formulation of Noether's theorem. These approaches and ideas can be, and in fact have been, extended to other areas of physics as statistical mechanics, continuum mechanics, classical field theory and quantum field theory. Moreover, they have provided several examples and ideas in differential geometry (e.g. several notions in symplectic geometry and vector bundle). = Partial differential equations = Following mathematics: the theory of partial differential equation, variational calculus, Fourier analysis, potential theory, and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics. These were developed intensively from the second half of the 18th century (by, for example, D'Alembert, Euler, and Lagrange) until the 1930s. Physical applications of these developments include hydrodynamics, celestial mechanics, continuum mechanics, elasticity theory, acoustics, thermodynamics, electricity, magnetism, and aerodynamics. = Quantum theory = The theory of atomic spectra (and, later, quantum mechanics) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra, the spectral theory of operators, operator algebras and more broadly, functional analysis. Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes Schr√∂dinger operators, and it has connections to atomic and molecular physics. Quantum information theory is another subspecialty. = Relativity and quantum relativistic theories = The special and general theories of relativity require a rather different type of mathematics. This was group theory, which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry. This was, however, gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena. In the mathematical description of this physical areas, some concepts in homological algebra and category theory are also important nowadays. = Statistical mechanics = Statistical mechanics forms a separate field, which includes the theory of phase transitions. It relies upon the Hamiltonian mechanics (or its quantum version) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory. There are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics, in particular statistical physics.  Usage  Relationship between mathematics and physics The usage of the term \\"mathematical physics\\" is sometimes idiosyncratic. Certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not, in fact, considered parts of mathematical physics, while other closely related fields are. For example, ordinary differential equations and symplectic geometry are generally viewed as purely mathematical disciplines, whereas dynamical systems and Hamiltonian mechanics belong to mathematical physics. John Herapath used the term for the title of his 1847 text on \\"mathematical principles of natural philosophy\\"; the scope at that time being \\"the causes of heat, gaseous elasticity, gravitation, and other great phenomena of nature\\".John Herapath (1847) Mathematical Physics; or, the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, the causes of heat, gaseous elasticity, gravitation, and other great phenomena of nature, Whittaker and company via HathiTrust = Mathematical vs. theoretical physics = The term \\"mathematical physics\\" is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework. In this sense, mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and physics theoretical aspect. Although related to theoretical physics,Quote: \\" ... a negative definition of the theorist refers to his inability to make physical experiments, while a positive one... implies his encyclopaedic knowledge of physics combined with possessing enough mathematical armament. Depending on the ratio of these two components, the theorist may be nearer either to the experimentalist or to the mathematician. In the latter case, he is usually considered as a specialist in mathematical physics.\\", Ya. Frenkel, as related in A.T. Filippov, The Versatile Soliton, pg 131. Birkhauser, 2000. mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics. On the other hand, theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and experimental physics, which often requires theoretical physicists (and mathematical physicists in the more general sense) to use heuristic, intuitive, and approximate arguments.Quote: \\"Physical theory is something like a suit sewed for Nature. Good theory is like a good suit. ... Thus the theorist is like a tailor.\\" Ya. Frenkel, as related in Filippov (2000), pg 131. Such arguments are not considered rigorous by mathematicians, but that is changing over time . Such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical theories. Because of the required level of mathematical rigour, these researchers often deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered to be already solved. However, they can sometimes show that the previous solution was incomplete, incorrect, or simply too na√Øve. Issues about attempts to infer the second law of thermodynamics from statistical mechanics are examples. Other examples concern the subtleties involved with synchronisation procedures in special and general relativity (Sagnac effect and Einstein synchronisation). The effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing not only developed physics but also has influenced developments of some mathematical areas. For example, the development of quantum mechanics and some aspects of functional analysis parallel each other in many ways. The mathematical study of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in operator algebras. The attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory.  Prominent mathematical physicists  =Before Newton= In the first decade of the 16th century, amateur astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus proposed heliocentrism, and published a treatise on it in 1543. He retained the Ptolemaic idea of epicycles, and merely sought to simplify astronomy by constructing simpler sets of epicyclic orbits. Epicycles consist of circles upon circles. According to Aristotelian physics, the circle was the perfect form of motion, and was the intrinsic motion of Aristotle's fifth element‚Äîthe quintessence or universal essence known in Greek as aether for the English pure air‚Äîthat was the pure substance beyond the sublunary sphere, and thus was celestial entities' pure composition. The German Johannes Kepler [1571‚Äì1630], Tycho Brahe's assistant, modified Copernican orbits to ellipses, formalized in the equations of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. An enthusiastic atomist, Galileo Galilei in his 1623 book The Assayer asserted that the \\"book of nature is written in mathematics\\".Peter Machamer \\"Galileo Galilei\\"‚Äîsec 1 \\"Brief biography\\", in Zalta EN, ed, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spring 2010 edn His 1632 book, about his telescopic observations, supported heliocentrism.Antony G Flew, Dictionary of Philosophy, rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), p 129 Having introduced experimentation, Galileo then refuted geocentric cosmology by refuting Aristotelian physics itself. Galilei's 1638 book Discourse on Two New Sciences established the law of equal free fall as well as the principles of inertial motion, founding the central concepts of what would become today's classical mechanics. By the Galilean law of inertia as well as the principle of Galilean invariance, also called Galilean relativity, for any object experiencing inertia, there is empirical justification for knowing only that it is at relative rest or relative motion‚Äîrest or motion with respect to another object. Ren√© Descartes adopted Galilean principles and developed a complete system of heliocentric cosmology, anchored on the principle of vortex motion, Cartesian physics, whose widespread acceptance brought the demise of Aristotelian physics. Descartes sought to formalize mathematical reasoning in science, and developed Cartesian coordinates for geometrically plotting locations in 3D space and marking their progressions along the flow of time.Antony G Flew, Dictionary of Philosophy, rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), p 89 Christiaan Huygens was the first to transfer mathematical inquiry to describe unobservable physical phenomena, and for that reason Huygens is regarded as the first theoretical physicist and the founder of mathematical physics.Dijksterhuis, F. J. (2008). Stevin, Huygens and the Dutch republic. Nieuw archief voor wiskunde, 5, pp. 100-107. https://research.utwente.nl/files/6673130/Dijksterhuis_naw5-2008-09-2-100.pdfAndreessen, C.D. (2005) Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle. Cambridge University Press: 6 =Newtonian and post Newtonian= In this era, important concepts in calculus such as the fundamental theorem of calculus (proved in 1668 by Scottish mathematician James Gregory) and finding extrema and minima of functions via differentiation using Fermat's theorem (by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat) were already known before Leibniz and Newton. Isaac Newton (1642‚Äì1727) developed some concepts in calculus (although Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed similar concepts outside the context of physics) and Newton's method to solve problems in physics. He was extremely successful in his application of calculus to the theory of motion. Newton's theory of motion, shown in his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, published in 1687, modeled three Galilean laws of motion along with Newton's law of universal gravitation on a framework of absolute space‚Äîhypothesized by Newton as a physically real entity of Euclidean geometric structure extending infinitely in all directions‚Äîwhile presuming absolute time, supposedly justifying knowledge of absolute motion, the object's motion with respect to absolute space. The principle of Galilean invariance/relativity was merely implicit in Newton's theory of motion. Having ostensibly reduced the Keplerian celestial laws of motion as well as Galilean terrestrial laws of motion to a unifying force, Newton achieved great mathematical rigor, but with theoretical laxity.Imre Lakatos, auth, Worrall J & Currie G, eds, The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Volume 1: Philosophical Papers (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980), pp 213‚Äì214, 220 In the 18th century, the Swiss Daniel Bernoulli (1700‚Äì1782) made contributions to fluid dynamics, and vibrating strings. The Swiss Leonhard Euler (1707‚Äì1783) did special work in variational calculus, dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other areas. Also notable was the Italian-born Frenchman, Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736‚Äì1813) for work in analytical mechanics: he formulated Lagrangian mechanics) and variational methods. A major contribution to the formulation of Analytical Dynamics called Hamiltonian dynamics was also made by the Irish physicist, astronomer and mathematician, William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865). Hamiltonian dynamics had played an important role in the formulation of modern theories in physics, including field theory and quantum mechanics. The French mathematical physicist Joseph Fourier (1768 ‚Äì 1830) introduced the notion of Fourier series to solve the heat equation, giving rise to a new approach to solving partial differential equations by means of integral transforms. Into the early 19th century, following mathematicians in France, Germany and England had contributed to mathematical physics. The French Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749‚Äì1827) made paramount contributions to mathematical astronomy, potential theory. Sim√©on Denis Poisson (1781‚Äì1840) worked in analytical mechanics and potential theory. In Germany, Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777‚Äì1855) made key contributions to the theoretical foundations of electricity, magnetism, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. In England, George Green (1793-1841) published An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism in 1828, which in addition to its significant contributions to mathematics made early progress towards laying down the mathematical foundations of electricity and magnetism. A couple of decades ahead of Newton's publication of a particle theory of light, the Dutch Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695) developed the wave theory of light, published in 1690. By 1804, Thomas Young's double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, as though light were a wave, and thus Huygens's wave theory of light, as well as Huygens's inference that light waves were vibrations of the luminiferous aether, was accepted. Jean-Augustin Fresnel modeled hypothetical behavior of the aether. The English physicist Michael Faraday introduced the theoretical concept of a field‚Äînot action at a distance. Mid-19th century, the Scottish James Clerk Maxwell (1831‚Äì1879) reduced electricity and magnetism to Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory, whittled down by others to the four Maxwell's equations. Initially, optics was found consequent of Maxwell's field. Later, radiation and then today's known electromagnetic spectrum were found also consequent of this electromagnetic field. The English physicist Lord Rayleigh [1842‚Äì1919] worked on sound. The Irishmen William Rowan Hamilton (1805‚Äì1865), George Gabriel Stokes (1819‚Äì1903) and Lord Kelvin (1824‚Äì1907) produced several major works: Stokes was a leader in optics and fluid dynamics; Kelvin made substantial discoveries in thermodynamics; Hamilton did notable work on analytical mechanics, discovering a new and powerful approach nowadays known as Hamiltonian mechanics. Very relevant contributions to this approach are due to his German colleague mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi (1804‚Äì1851) in particular referring to canonical transformations. The German Hermann von Helmholtz (1821‚Äì1894) made substantial contributions in the fields of electromagnetism, waves, fluids, and sound. In the United States, the pioneering work of Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839‚Äì1903) became the basis for statistical mechanics. Fundamental theoretical results in this area were achieved by the German Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906). Together, these individuals laid the foundations of electromagnetic theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. =Relativistic= By the 1880s, there was a prominent paradox that an observer within Maxwell's electromagnetic field measured it at approximately constant speed, regardless of the observer's speed relative to other objects within the electromagnetic field. Thus, although the observer's speed was continually lost relative to the electromagnetic field, it was preserved relative to other objects in the electromagnetic field. And yet no violation of Galilean invariance within physical interactions among objects was detected. As Maxwell's electromagnetic field was modeled as oscillations of the aether, physicists inferred that motion within the aether resulted in aether drift, shifting the electromagnetic field, explaining the observer's missing speed relative to it. The Galilean transformation had been the mathematical process used to translate the positions in one reference frame to predictions of positions in another reference frame, all plotted on Cartesian coordinates, but this process was replaced by Lorentz transformation, modeled by the Dutch Hendrik Lorentz [1853‚Äì1928]. In 1887, experimentalists Michelson and Morley failed to detect aether drift, however. It was hypothesized that motion into the aether prompted aether's shortening, too, as modeled in the Lorentz contraction. It was hypothesized that the aether thus kept Maxwell's electromagnetic field aligned with the principle of Galilean invariance across all inertial frames of reference, while Newton's theory of motion was spared. Austrian theoretical physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach criticized Newton's postulated absolute space. Mathematician Jules-Henri Poincar√© (1854‚Äì1912) questioned even absolute time. In 1905, Pierre Duhem published a devastating criticism of the foundation of Newton's theory of motion. Also in 1905, Albert Einstein (1879‚Äì1955) published his special theory of relativity, newly explaining both the electromagnetic field's invariance and Galilean invariance by discarding all hypotheses concerning aether, including the existence of aether itself. Refuting the framework of Newton's theory‚Äîabsolute space and absolute time‚Äîspecial relativity refers to relative space and relative time, whereby length contracts and time dilates along the travel pathway of an object. In 1908, Einstein's former mathematics professor Hermann Minkowski modeled 3D space together with the 1D axis of time by treating the temporal axis like a fourth spatial dimension‚Äîaltogether 4D spacetime‚Äîand declared the imminent demise of the separation of space and time Minkowski, Hermann (1908‚Äì1909), \\"Raum und Zeit\\" [Space and Time], Physikalische Zeitschrift, 10: 75‚Äì88 . Einstein initially called this \\"superfluous learnedness\\", but later used Minkowski spacetime with great elegance in his general theory of relativity,Salmon WC & Wolters G, eds, Logic, Language, and the Structure of Scientific Theories (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1994), p 125 extending invariance to all reference frames‚Äîwhether perceived as inertial or as accelerated‚Äîand credited this to Minkowski, by then deceased. General relativity replaces Cartesian coordinates with Gaussian coordinates, and replaces Newton's claimed empty yet Euclidean space traversed instantly by Newton's vector of hypothetical gravitational force‚Äîan instant action at a distance‚Äîwith a gravitational field. The gravitational field is Minkowski spacetime itself, the 4D topology of Einstein aether modeled on a Lorentzian manifold that \\"curves\\" geometrically, according to the Riemann curvature tensor. The concept of Newton's gravity: \\"two masses attract each other\\" replaced by the geometrical arugument: \\"mass transform curvatures of spacetime and free falling particles with mass move along a geodesic curve in the spacetime\\" (Riemannian geometry already existed before 1850s, by mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann in search for intrinsic geometry and non-Euclidean geometry.), in the vicinity of either mass or energy. (Under special relativity‚Äîa special case of general relativity‚Äîeven massless energy exerts gravitational effect by its mass equivalence locally \\"curving\\" the geometry of the four, unified dimensions of space and time.) =Quantum= Another revolutionary development of the 20th century was quantum theory, which emerged from the seminal contributions of Max Planck (1856‚Äì1947) (on black-body radiation) and Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect. In 1912, a mathematician Henri Poincare published Sur la th√©orie des quanta . He introduced the first non-na√Øve definition of quantization in this paper. The development of early quantum physics followed by a heuristic framework devised by Arnold Sommerfeld (1868‚Äì1951) and Niels Bohr (1885‚Äì1962), but this was soon replaced by the quantum mechanics developed by Max Born (1882‚Äì1970), Werner Heisenberg (1901‚Äì1976), Paul Dirac (1902‚Äì1984), Erwin Schr√∂dinger (1887‚Äì1961), Satyendra Nath Bose (1894‚Äì1974), and Wolfgang Pauli (1900‚Äì1958). This revolutionary theoretical framework is based on a probabilistic interpretation of states, and evolution and measurements in terms of self-adjoint operators on an infinite dimensional vector space. That is called Hilbert space(introduced by mathematicians David Hilbert (1862‚Äì1943), Erhard Schmidt(1876-1959) and Frigyes Riesz (1880-1956) in search of generalization of Euclidean space and study of intrgral equations), and rigorously defined within the axiomatic modern version by John von Neumann in his celebrated book Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, where he built up a relevant part of modern functional analysis on Hilbert spaces, the spectral theory(introduced by David Hilbert who investigated quadratic forms with infinitely many variables. Many years later, it had been revealed that his spectral theory is associated with the spectrum of hydrogen atom. He was surprised by this application.) in particular. Paul Dirac used algebraic constructions to produce a relativistic model for the electron, predicting its magnetic moment and the existence of its antiparticle, the positron. =List of prominent contributors to mathematical physicists in the 20th century= Prominent contributors to the 20th century's mathematical physics include, (ordered by birth date) William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) [1824‚Äì1907], Oliver Heaviside [1850‚Äì1925], Jules Henri Poincar√© [1854‚Äì1912] , David Hilbert [1862‚Äì1943], Arnold Sommerfeld [1868‚Äì1951], Constantin Carath√©odory [1873‚Äì1950], Albert Einstein [1879‚Äì1955], Max Born [1882‚Äì1970], George David Birkhoff [1884-1944], Hermann Weyl [1885‚Äì1955], Satyendra Nath Bose [1894-1974], Norbert Wiener [1894‚Äì1964], John Lighton Synge (1897‚Äì1995), Wolfgang Pauli [1900‚Äì1958], Paul Dirac [1902‚Äì1984], Eugene Wigner [1902‚Äì1995], Andrey Kolmogorov [1903-1987], Lars Onsager [1903-1976], John von Neumann [1903‚Äì1957], Sin-Itiro Tomonaga [1906‚Äì1979], Hideki Yukawa [1907‚Äì1981], Nikolay Nikolayevich Bogolyubov [1909‚Äì1992], Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar [1910-1995], Mark Kac [1914‚Äì1984], Julian Schwinger [1918‚Äì1994], Richard Phillips Feynman [1918‚Äì1988], Irving Ezra Segal [1918‚Äì1998], Ryogo Kubo [1920‚Äì1995], Arthur Strong Wightman [1922‚Äì2013], Chen-Ning Yang [1922‚Äì ], Rudolf Haag [1922‚Äì2016], Freeman John Dyson [1923‚Äì2020], Martin Gutzwiller [1925‚Äì2014], Abdus Salam [1926‚Äì1996], J√ºrgen Moser [1928‚Äì1999], Michael Francis Atiyah [1929‚Äì2019], Joel Louis Lebowitz [1930‚Äì ], Roger Penrose [1931‚Äì ], Elliott Hershel Lieb [1932‚Äì ], Sheldon Lee Glashow [1932‚Äì ], Steven Weinberg [1933‚Äì ], Ludvig Dmitrievich Faddeev [1934‚Äì2017], David Ruelle [1935‚Äì ], Yakov Grigorevich Sinai [1935‚Äì ], Vladimir Igorevich Arnold [1937‚Äì2010], Arthur Michael Jaffe [1937‚Äì ], Roman Wladimir Jackiw [1939‚Äì ], Leonard Susskind [1940‚Äì ], Rodney James Baxter [1940‚Äì ], Michael Victor Berry [1941- ], Giovanni Gallavotti [1941- ], Stephen William Hawking [1942‚Äì2018], Jerrold Eldon Marsden [1942‚Äì2010], Alexander Markovich Polyakov [1945‚Äì ], John Lawrence Cardy [1947‚Äì ], Giorgio Parisi [1948‚Äì ], Edward Witten [1951‚Äì ], Herbert Spohn [1951?‚Äì ], Ashoke Sen [1956-] and Juan Mart√≠n Maldacena [1968‚Äì ].

It is the second game in the Soulcalibur series, preceded by Soul Edge in December 1995. Originally released in arcades in July 30, 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware. It was ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 with new features and improved graphics. The North American release was released in September 1999 as a launch game for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console. It became available as a downloadable title on the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Marketplace in July 2008 and it is forward compatible with the Xbox One along with the sequel, Soulcalibur II. The game centers on the pursuit of the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge, now in the possession of a warrior known as Nightmare, who slaughters countless people to satisfy the blade's bloodlust. Other warriors pursue him either to claim the weapon for themselves or to destroy it, end his mass murder, and free him of its curse. Developed closely with Namco's Tekken development team, it is one of few home console ports that outdid their arcade parent graphics-wise. The title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system. Soulcalibur is widely regarded as one of the best Dreamcast titles, is the second highest rated video game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time with a 97% score on GameRankings, 98 on Metacritic, and won the majority of Game of the Year awards in its respective year and is often cited as arguably one of the greatest fighting game, as well as one of the greatest video games ever, topping numerous best video game lists over the years. Gameplay Nightmare fighting against Sophitia in the Dreamcast version. One of the biggest innovations introduced by Soulcalibur to the gameplay system of its predecessor, Soul Edge, is the eight-way run. Previous 3D fighters had only limited movement along the third axis, with sidesteps and rolls providing useful but unsustained lateral movement. In Soulcalibur, simply holding down a joystick direction causes the character to run in that direction, giving the player a sense of freedom and deepening the strategy of the game. Soulcalibur also improved gameplay with \\"forgiving buffering\\", executing the input for one move before the player's character has finished recovering from his previous move, and leads to executing a quick succession of moves (other fighting games such as the Tekken and Virtua Fighter series have relatively strict buffering requirements, meaning expert timing is required to pull off many combinations, but Soulcalibur features much more lenient timing to successfully execute a buffer). Finally, the Guard Impact offensive blocking maneuver shown in Soul Edge was given a deeper range of techniques in Soulcalibur, allowing players to push back or redirect attacks past themselves as well as swatting away an opponent's weapon to stun them. Characters Soulcalibur was originally planned to be a dramatic overhaul, with all new characters apart from Mitsurugi from Soul Edge. However, nine of the 11 characters from Soul Edge ended up carrying over to Soulcalibur by the time the roster was finalized in the Dreamcast version (Cervantes, Hwang, Seong Mi-na, Mitsurugi, Rock, Siegfried, Sophitia, Taki, Voldo), with an additional ten new characters joining the ranks (in the South Korean version of the game, Mitsurugi was replaced by an English-Japanese swordsman named Arthur ÏÜåÏö∏ÏπºÎ¶¨Î≤Ñ3(ÏÜåÏö∏ÏπºÎ¶¨Î≤Ñ 3) - Í≤åÏûÑÎ©îÏπ¥, GameMeca, 04.11.2005). As with many fighting games, many of the new characters were heavily styled after existing characters from the franchise. For example, new character Maxi has a fighting style and move set influenced by Soul Edge's Li Long (the only of the original starting characters not to return). In fact, Soulcalibur only added one original playing style, belonging to Ivy. New characters Xianghua, Maxi, Yoshimitsu, Astaroth, Kilik, Nightmare, and Lizardman were based upon existing characters Hwang, Li Long, Mitsurugi, Rock, Seong Mi-na, Siegfried, and Sophitia, respectively. Consequently, Namco has been working since Soulcalibur to gradually separate the individual styles of the characters in order to make each one unique. Plot The mystical sword of the legends, the \\"Soul Edge\\", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years, he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young German knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the \\"Evil Seed\\", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake. Three years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them, three sacred weapons join once again. Development After releasing Soul Edge, Namco took some time to evaluate what had made the game successful before jumping into the development of its follow-up. Producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama decided to give the sequel a new name instead of just calling it Soul Edge 2 in order to have a fresh start and take the series in a new direction. The name Soulcalibur is a portmanteau of the word soul (as in Soul Edge) and King Arthur's sword Excalibur (ultimately, the name would be used within the game's universe for the holy weapon which would counteract Soul Edge's evil). Inspired by an internal Namco prototype featuring a character able to run openly in a field, the eight-way run system was implemented. Upon application, the development team was surprised at how well it meshed with their fighting system and decided to build the rest of the game around it. During development they worked closely with Namco's Tekken development team, sharing ideas and research. Yotoriyama felt that with that cooperation and partnership, they were able to develop \\"the greatest weapon-based fighting action game in the world\\". Yotoriyama has described the game's concept as expressing \\"fun and diversity in weapon combat\\", citing the contrast in how one weapon would affect gameplay compared to another and how they would react to each other upon clashing. Each character's fighting style was designed to revolve around their weapon, though he noted that because of the differences they experienced difficulty in balancing the gameplay. He described the availability of movement in comparison to Tekken 3 as a large contrast between the two series and more tactical and emphasized how it interacted with the game's \\"ring out\\" feature. Each character in Soulcalibur was designed around the idea that they could be viewed as a real person could, and to this end, motion creator Masataka Ishiguro emphasized the arm and leg movements for each character in relation to their weapon, wanting players to \\"feel the individual motions and the realism within the game\\" The team for the arcade version of Soulcalibur consisted of roughly 60 people working on Namco's System 12 hardware, while the team developing the home port was reduced to about forty. Given a deadline of seven months to coincide with the North American launch of the Dreamcast, the transition was difficult for the team, due to the differences in hardware. However, due to the similar capabilities and limits of each system, content was left intact between the two versions, with Yotoriyama feeling that the team was \\"obsessed\\" with giving their best effort for the port. The biggest technological change to the Dreamcast port was to render all of the game's stages in full 3D polygons, whereas the far backgrounds in the arcade original were flat, two-dimensional images. Additional content was also added to the game to ensure replay value, based on researching other fighting games marketed at the time. Many of the team's ideas that they were unable to incorporate into the port were eventually used for later games in the series. Release The game was originally released in the Japanese arcades on July 30, 1998. A Gamest Book series guide book Soul Calibur Skill Up Manual („ÇΩ„Ç¶„É´„Ç≠„É£„É™„Éê„Éº „Çπ„Ç≠„É´„Ç¢„ÉÉ„Éó„Éû„Éã„É•„Ç¢„É´) was published by Shinseisha on September 27, 1998. =Dreamcast= The Dreamcast port of Soulcalibur was released in Japan on August 5, 1999; and in North America as a launch title, on September 9, 1999. The North American Dreamcast version of the game removes one of Voldo's suggestive codpieces featuring a bull. However, the codpiece is present in the European and Japanese versions, as well as the North American Xbox 360 version. The European Dreamcast version was distributed and advertised by Sega Europe. The Dreamcast version of Soulcalibur is one of the first examples of a home conversion of a game being graphically superior to its original arcade counterpart. Among the differences were the improved graphics (including the addition of 3D backgrounds), tweaked gameplay, new game modes, new costumes, and the inclusion of an extra character, Cervantes de Leon. The Dreamcast version features new modes such as Team Battle, Survival, and Training Mode. In Mission Battle, the player completes various missions to attain points, which can be used to buy various art, which then unlocks extra features, costumes and stages. Another feature added is the artwork section, containing official artwork, fanart, and high-res pictures. Also unlockable are a \\"liquid metal\\" version of the characters' costume and a \\"Battle Theater\\" mode, plus a way to modify the opening introduction theme by changing the characters appearing in it, and an \\"Exhibition Mode\\" displaying characters performing their katas (in Mission Mode it is possible to add more characters to the \\"Exhibition Mode\\", such as Taki and Seung Mina). =Xbox 360 (Xbox Live Arcade)= In 2008, Namco Bandai Games announced a port of Soulcalibur would be released for the Xbox 360. The port was based on the European Dreamcast version and was made available for download on Xbox Live Arcade on July 2, 2008. While the game included HD updated graphics and various Live leaderboards, online play was absent which makes it an exception amongst most games ported to Xbox Live Arcade. Other features from the Dreamcast version (Museum, etc., with the exception of Mission Battle) are also in the game. While the intro is removed from this port, the intro music is still in this port. All content is unlocked by the start of the game. =iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch)= On January 19, 2012, Namco Bandai released a port of Soulcalibur for Apple's iOS platform. Game modes in this version include Arcade, Time Attack, Survival, Extra Survival, Practice, and Museum mode. The game was released as a Universal App to run at native resolutions on iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch. The game is no longer available in the iOS store. =Android= On November 20, 2013, Namco Bandai released a port of Soulcalibur for the Android platform. The app makes use of Google Play Games for synchronization between devices and runs at native resolution and screen aspect ratio. The game is no longer available in the Google Play Store. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Soulcalibur on their September 1, 1998 issue as being the third most-successful arcade game of the year. Soulcalibur sold in excess of one million copies by December 1999. It is the second biggest selling game on the system. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics Award for \\"Best Fighting Game\\" and the AIAS Interactive Achievement Awards for 1999's \\"Console Game of the Year\\" and \\"Console Fighting Game of the Year\\" (along with a nomination for \\"Game of the Year\\"). Blake Fischer reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"Beautiful, deep, and far more compelling than any 3D fighter in recent memory, Soul Calibur is reason enough to own a Dreamcast.\\" The game received universal critical acclaim, garnering perfect 10/10 scores from GameSpot and IGN, and was for nearly a decade the last game to receive a perfect rating from IGN, until the release of Grand Theft Auto IV in 2008. It is the second game ever to get a perfect 40/40 from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu (the first being The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time). As of 2017, game review aggregator website GameRankings has the Dreamcast version ranked as the seventh best-reviewed game of all time, as well as being the highest scoring title in the fighting game genre. The Dreamcast version of Soulcalibur also holds a score of 98, making it one of the highest rated video games of all time across all consoles and platforms, on Metacritic. =Retrospective= Soulcalibur was named as the number one best Dreamcast game by Game Informer.Game Informer, Issue 166, February 2007. Page 116 In 2009, IGN ranked Soulcalibur as the fifth best Dreamcast game, while ScrewAttack ranked it sixth. GamesRadar named Soulcalibur the best Dreamcast game of all time on their list. In 2005, GameSpot ranked Soulcalibur as the sixth best launch title yet, calling it \\"not only one of the greatest launch games or one of the greatest fighters, but one of the greatest games ever.

Originally released as an arcade game in December 1995, an upgraded and expanded version of the game was ported to the PlayStation in December 1996. The PlayStation version was renamed Soul Blade in North America, Europe, and Australia. The plot centers upon the eponymous sword, shrouded in mystery and rumored to offer unlimited power to anyone who can find and wield it; nine warriors embark on a journey to pursue a tenth who is rumored to have the sword, some to claim it and others to destroy it. The game was a commercial and critical success and was followed up with Soulcalibur in July 1998. Gameplay Taki and Voldo Soul Edge was created prior to the introduction of the so-called 8-Way Run. The characters can sidestep to either side by double-tapping down to move to the foreground or tapping down then up to the background. The jump maneuver (which in Soulcalibur is more like a hop) moves the player higher into the air, even allowing it to pass above the opponent (much like in Tekken). The game uses an active block system performed by pressing the block button, and a combat system based on the three attack buttons: horizontal attack, vertical attack, and kick. Character moves retain a feel of Namco's Tekken series. Each character has one or two slow but unblockable attacks. Each character is also capable of performing one or two \\"Critical Edge\\" attacks, consisting of a long series of linked hits, usually ending in a strong high attack. These moves require the input of a special combination of two parts: they are activated by pressing all three attack buttons together, and if it connects, the player has the chance of extending the combo with a character-specific sequence, which must be input during the attack. This attack depletes one-third of the Weapon Gauge when used. The Weapon Gauge is a life bar for the character's equipped weapon. Each time the player blocks an attack, the bar depletes. If the bar is totally emptied, the weapon is lost and the character is forced to fight unarmed. The unarmed move-lists are the same for every character. Another feature that was removed from Soulcaliburs engine is a rock paper scissors situation when two character strike at the same time, locking their weapons; those who press the correct button have the advantage. Soul Edge uses an optional offensive block maneuver called the \\"Guard Impact\\" that allows players to intercept incoming attacks and push them back, resulting in a momentary opportunity for a free counterattack. Opponents, however, are also able to return a Guard Impact after receiving a Guard Impact, allowing for stalemate clashes until one opponent missed the subsequent timing. This gameplay feature is expanded in future Soul series games. The game uses the ring out system, which is a forcible maneuver that ejects the opponent from the arena and gains an automatic victory for the round. To achieve a ring out, a character must be knocked outside the ring by an enemy (the player cannot accidentally or deliberately get a ring out by hopping out of the ring). The only exception to this rule is Cervantes and Inferno (known in this game as SoulEdge), who can get a ring out by themselves upon performing a certain special attack, as long as they are near the edge of the arena. Plot and characters Soul Edges events take place in the year 1583. The game tells the tale of warriors searching for the ultimate sword, \\"Soul Edge\\". It has been given many names throughout the history, such as \\"The Sword of Salvation\\", \\"The Sword of Heroes\\", and \\"The Ultimate Sword\\", among others. Many strong warriors searched for years, but very few actually found it. The sword, currently in the form of a twin pair of long swords, appeared mysteriously in an auction. It was taken by the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon and nothing is known of his fate thereafter. Presently, nine warriors from around the world (Hwang, Li Long, Mitsurugi, Rock, Seong Mi-na, Siegfried, Sophitia, Taki, and Voldo) search for the sword for different reasons. Some desire its power, others want revenge. Some, believing that it is a benevolent sword, crave its support. Others, knowing of its evil nature, seek its destruction. Nothing is known for certain about the sword, except for one thing: it brings misfortune to those seeking it. What many do not know is that the sword's power is evil, feeding upon the souls of not only its victims but its wielder as well. Development and release Soul Edge was developed as an experiment by Namco to explore the possibilities of a weapon-based fighting game. It was the first motion capture based video game created by using passive optical system markers. Soul Edge was initially released in arcades in 1995. A Gamest Mook series guide book (GMC-30) was published by Shinseisha on April 30, 1996. A couple of months later, Namco released a fixed version, labeled Soul Edge Ver. II. Hwang (initially a palette swap of Mitsurugi for the Korean version of the game) was introduced to Japanese players with a new move list, Cervantes became playable, Guard Impacts and Air Combos were implemented, all the characters received upgraded move lists, and new stages were added. The overseas PlayStation version was renamed Soul Blade to avoid potential complications due to EDGE Games' earlier \\"EDGE\\" trademark. =PlayStation= On December 20, 1996, Soul Edge was ported to the Sony PlayStation for the Japanese market. A limited special edition came with the Namco Joystick controller. An official tribute book Soul Edge Official Fan Book („ÇΩ„Ç¶„É´„Ç®„ÉÉ„Ç∏ „Ç™„Éï„Ç£„Ç∑„É£„É´„Éï„Ç°„É≥„Éñ„ÉÉ„ÇØÔºèÂπ¥‰ª£Ë®ò) was published in the Chronicle series by Famitsu on March 31, 1997. The port kept the Soul Edge Ver. II roster of ten characters and added five unlockable characters, including SoulEdge, the final boss of the game. Other PlayStation-specific features include: * A new costume for each character, chosen from various works sent by fans, giving each one a total of three different costumes, plus two color variations for the Player 1 and Player 2 costumes. It also includesbesides the standard Arcade modeVS mode, Survival, Team Battle, Time Attack, and Training modes. * A new RPG- styled mode called Edge Master mode, which works as a kind of story mode for the ten initial characters. The mode presents the selected character's story as a book, while the player moves in a map to various locations and fights in battles, sometimes with handicap rules. Generally, each chapter of the book rewards the player with a weapon. * An opening CGI cinematic and individual endings done using the game's engine rather than still images as in its sequels Soulcalibur and Soulcalibur II. Each of the ten normally selectable characters have two endings, usually one happy ending and another tragic ending. These endings are accessible by pressing a special button/button sequence during certain times, indicated by black bars moving away, while others involve a short minigame, such as Mitsurugi avoiding gunshots. This type of ending was finally brought back in Soulcalibur III. * The inclusion of seven extra weapons per character, which have different designs and statistics, composed of Power (inflicts more damage), Defense (receives less damage), Strength (damage dealt to enemy's weapon gauge), Durability (resistance of player's weapon gauge), and Weight (changes character's speed). Certain weapons also have a special ability, such as the ability to damage through defense or restore/drain the player's health. * The inclusion of three different in-game soundtracks to choose from: the original arcade soundtrack, a studio-recorded version of the arcade soundtrack called \\"Arrange Soundtrack\\" and the Khan Super Session, made expressly for the home version. * In the English version, all non-Asian characters have their English voice as default. (The concept of speaking different languages was followed by Tekken 4 since the character Julia Chang from Tekken 3 speaks in her ending.) Versions labeled Soul Blade came out in 1997. In the North American version, clothes were added to Sophitia in the opening cutscene where she would have been nude. In the European version, Li Long's pair of nunchaku were changed to a three- section staff, since BBFC guidelines at the time banned the depiction of nunchaku.European manual, page 20. =Soundtracks= Two soundtrack CDs were released for the game: Soul Edge Original Soundtrack - Khan Super Session and Super Battle Sound Attack Soul Edge. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Soul Edge on their March 15, 1996 issue as being the second most- successful arcade game of the year. However according to Next Generation, the game was only moderately successful in the arcades. Next Generation reviewed the arcade version of Soul Edge Version II, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"there is still the slight control delay, but character movement is still fluid and seamless, and the trailing slashes of light in the wake of weapon movement is as gorgeous as ever.\\" The PlayStation conversion, Soul Blade, was a bestseller in the UK.Gallup UK Playstation sales chart, August 1997, published in Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 22. Due to its popularity, the game has been re-released as part of the PlayStation Greatest Hits, the PlayStation Platinum range, and the PlayStation The Best series. The PlayStation game received very positive reviews. It holds aggregated scores of 91% on GameRankings and 89/100 on Metacritic, including high ratings by IGN (\\"extremely fun, and has just enough new elements to make it worth playing multiple times\\"), and GameSpot (\\"a great fighting game with its share of flaws\\"). Next Generation praised it for \\"filling in all the blanks with great gameplay, superb characters, unique graphics, and combines them into one solid package.\\"Next Generation 14 (February 1996), page 177. They later commended the PlayStation port for retaining all the characters, levels, graphics, and gameplay from the arcade version. GameFan called it \\"without a doubt the most stunning graphical fighting feast ever to grace any console.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly particularly applauded the full motion video intro and the new story mode. They awarded it \\"Best Intro\\" in their 1998 Video Game Buyer's Guide. A reviewer for GamePro stated: \\"Bow down to the new king of fighters, and the first gotta-play-it game of the year.\\"GamePro 102 (March 1997), pages 66-67. In 1997, PSM named Soul Edge as the fourth top game on the PlayStation. PSU listed this game as the sixth \\"PSone classic\\" most deserving to be remade for the PlayStation 3 in 2011. That same year, Complex ranked Soul Edge as the 19th best fighting game of all time. The PlayStation version's opening sequence won the SIGGRAPH '97 award for the best game video of 1996. It was also included on the list of the ten all-time best game cinematics by Cheat Code Central in 2012.

The M1 carbine was produced in several variants and was widely used by not only the U.S. military, but by paramilitary and police forces around the world. It has also been a popular civilian firearm. The M2 carbine is the selective-fire version of the M1 carbine capable of firing in both semi- automatic and full-automatic. The M3 carbine was an M2 carbine with an active infrared scope system. Despite having a similar name and appearance, the M1 carbine is not a carbine version of the M1 Garand rifle. They are different firearms, and they use different ammunition. On July 1, 1925, the U.S. Army began using the current naming system where the \\"M\\" is the designation for \\"Model\\" and the number represents the sequential development of equipment and weapons.International Encyclopedia of Military History. James C. Bradford. Routledge, Dec 1, 2004. p. 886 Therefore, the \\"M1 rifle\\" was the first rifle developed under this system. The \\"M1 carbine\\" was the first carbine developed under this system. The \\"M2 carbine\\" was the second carbine developed under the system, etc. This is why the carbine version of the M16 rifle is the M4.

A U.S. anti-tank crew in combat in the Netherlands, November 4, 1944. The soldier on the far right is holding an M1 carbine Prior to World War II, U.S. Army Ordnance received reports that the full-size M1 rifle was too heavy and cumbersome for most support troops (staff, mortarmen, radiomen, etc.) to carry. During prewar and early war field exercises, it was found that the M1 Garand impeded these soldiers' mobility, as a slung rifle would frequently catch on brush, bang the helmet and tilt it over the eyes. Many soldiers found the rifle slid off the shoulder unless slung diagonally across the back, where it prevented the wearing of standard field packs and haversacks. Additionally, Germany's use of glider-borne and paratroop forces to launch surprise ‚Äòblitzkrieg‚Äô attacks behind the front lines generated a request for a new compact infantry weapon to equip support troops. This request called for a compact, lightweight defensive weapon with greater range, accuracy and firepower than handguns, while weighing half as much as the Thompson submachine gun or the M1 rifle. The U.S. Army decided that a carbine would adequately fulfill all of these requirements, but specified that the new arm should weigh no more than five pounds and have an effective range of 300 yards. Paratroopers were also added to the list of intended users and a folding-stock version would also be developed. =Designing the M1 carbine= In 1938, the Chief of Infantry requested that the Ordnance Department develop a \\"light rifle\\" or carbine, though the formal requirement for the weapon type was not approved until 1940. This led to a competition in 1941 by major U.S. firearm companies and designers. Winchester at first did not submit a carbine design, as it was occupied in developing the .30-06 Winchester M2 military rifle. The rifle originated as a design by Jonathan \\"Ed\\" Browning, brother of the famous firearm designer John Browning. A couple of months after Ed Browning's death in May 1939, Winchester hired David Marshall \\"Carbine\\" Williams who had begun work on a short-stroke gas piston design while serving a prison sentence at a North Carolina minimum-security work farm. Winchester, after Williams' release, had hired Williams on the strength of recommendations of firearms industry leaders and hoped Williams would be able to complete various designs left unfinished by Ed Browning, including the Winchester .30-06 M2 rifle. Williams incorporated his short-stroke piston in the existing design. After the Marine Corps semi-automatic rifle trials in 1940, Browning's rear-locking tilting bolt design proved unreliable in sandy conditions. As a result, the rifle was redesigned to incorporate a Garand-style rotating bolt and operating rod, retaining Williams' short-stroke piston. By May 1941, Williams had shaved the M2 rifle prototype from about to a mere . Ordnance found unsatisfactory the first series of prototype carbines submitted by several firearms companies and some independent designers. Winchester had contacted the Ordnance Corps to examine their rifle M2 design. Major Ren√© Studler of Ordnance believed the rifle design could be scaled down to a carbine which would weigh 4.5 to 4.75 lb and demanded a prototype as soon as possible. The first model was developed at Winchester in 13 days by William C. Roemer, Fred Humeston and three other Winchester engineers under supervision of Edwin Pugsley, and was essentially Williams' last version of the .30-06 M2 scaled down to the .30 SL cartridge. This patchwork prototype was cobbled together using the trigger housing and lockwork of a Winchester M1905 rifle and a modified Garand operating rod. The prototype was an immediate hit with army observers.. After the initial army testing in August 1941, the Winchester design team set out to develop a more refined version. Williams participated in the finishing of this prototype. The second prototype competed successfully against all remaining carbine candidates in September 1941, and Winchester was notified of their success the very next month. Standardization as the M1 carbine was approved on October 22, 1941. This story was the loose basis for the 1952 movie Carbine Williams starring James Stewart. Contrary to the movie, Williams had little to do with the carbine's development, with the exception of his short-stroke gas piston design. Williams worked on his own design apart from the other Winchester staff, but it was not ready for testing until December 1941, two months after the Winchester M1 carbine had been adopted and type-classified. Winchester supervisor Edwin Pugsley conceded that Williams' final design was \\"an advance on the one that was accepted\\", but noted that Williams' decision to go it alone was a distinct impediment to the project, and Williams' additional design features were not incorporated into M1 production. In a 1951 memo written in fear of a patent infringement lawsuit by Williams, Winchester noted his patent for the short-stroke piston may have been improperly granted as a previous patent covering the same principle of operation was overlooked by the patent office. In 1973 the senior technical editor at the NRA contacted Edwin Pugsley for \\"a technical last testament\\" on M1 carbine history shortly before his death 19 Nov 1975. According to Pugsley, \\"The carbine was invented by no single man,\\" but was the result of a team effort including Bill Roemer, Marsh Williams, Fred Humeston, Cliff Warner, at least three other Winchester engineers, and Pugsley himself. Ideas were taken and modified from the Winchester M2 Browning rifle (Williams' gas system), the Winchester Model 1905 rifle (fire control group and magazine), M1 Garand (buttstock dimensions, and bolt and operating slide principles), and a percussion shotgun in Pugsley's collection (hook breech and barrel band assembly/disassembly).E.H. Harrison, \\"Who Designed the M1 Carbine?\\", in U.S. Caliber .30 Carbine, NRA American Rifleman Reprint.

Marine armed with an M1 carbine and M8 grenade launcher attached to the muzzle, during the Battle of Iwo Jima. =Ammunition= The .30 carbine cartridge is essentially a rimless version of the then-obsolete .32 Winchester Self-Loading cartridge introduced for the Winchester Model 1905 rifle. The propellant was much newer, though, taking advantage of chemistry advances. As a result, the .30 carbine cartridge is approximately 27% more powerful than its parent cartridge. A standard .30 carbine ball bullet weighs 110 grains (7.1 g), a complete loaded round weighs 195 grains (12.6 g) and has a muzzle velocity of 1,990 ft/s (610 m/s) giving it 967 ft¬∑lbf (1,311 joules) of energy, when fired from the M1 carbine's 18\\" barrel. In comparison, the .30-06 Springfield ball round used by the M1 Garand is almost three times more powerful than the .30 carbine. The carbine round is twice as powerful as the .45 ACP-caliber Thompson submachine gun in common use at the time. As a result, the carbine offers much better range, accuracy and penetration than those submachine guns. The M1 is also half the weight of the Thompson, and fires a lighter cartridge. Therefore, soldiers armed with the carbine can carry much more ammunition than those armed with a Thompson. Categorizing the M1 carbine series has been the subject of much debate. Although commonly compared to the later German StG44 and Russian AK-47, the M1 and M2 carbines are under-powered and outclassed by comparison. The carbine instead falls somewhere between the submachine gun and the assault rifle, and could be called a precursor of the personal defense weapon since it fulfilled a similar role. One characteristic of .30 caliber carbine ammunition is that from the beginning of production, non-corrosive primers were specified. This was the first major use of this type of primer in a military firearm. Because the rifle had a closed gas system, not normally disassembled, corrosive primers would have led to a rapid deterioration of the gas system. The use of non-corrosive primers was a novelty in service ammunition at this time. Some failures to fire were reported in early lots of .30 caliber carbine ammunition, attributed to moisture ingress of the non- corrosive primer compound. =Sights, range & accuracy= The M1 carbine entered service with a simple flip sight, which had two settings: 150 and 300 yards. However, field reports indicated that this sight was inadequate, and in 1944, it was replaced by a sliding ramp-type adjustable sight with four settings: 100, 200, 250 and 300 yards. This new rear sight was also adjustable for windage. At , the M1 carbine can deliver groups between 3 and 5 inches, sufficient for its intended purpose as a close-range defensive weapon. The M1 carbine has a maximum effective range of . However, bullet drop is significant past . Therefore, the M1 has a practical effective range of about 200 yards. =Magazines= The M1 carbine entered service with a standard straight 15-round box magazine. The introduction of the select-fire M2 carbine in October 1944 also brought into service the curved 30-round magazine or \\"Banana Clip\\". After WW2, the 30-round magazine quickly became the standard magazine for both the M1 and M2 carbines, although the 15-round magazine remained in service until the end of the Vietnam war. Perhaps the most common accessory used on the M1 carbine was a standard magazine belt pouch that was mounted to the right side of the stock and held two extra 15-round magazines. This field adaptation was never officially approved, but proved an efficient method to supply extra ammunition in combat. After the introduction of the 30-round magazine, it was common for troops to tape two 30-round magazines together, a practice that became known as \\"Jungle style\\". This led the military to introduce the \\"Holder, Magazine T3-A1\\" also called the \\"Jungle Clip\\", a metal clamp that held two magazines together without the need for tape. The 30-round magazines introduced for use with the selective-fire M2 carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 carbine which was designed to retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be properly seated in the M1 carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 carbine (and late production M1 carbines) if they are to be used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines. Initial combat reports noted that M1 carbine's magazine release button was often mistaken for the safety button while under fire. When this occurred, pressing the mag release caused the loaded magazine to drop into the dirt, while the safety remained in the off position. As a result, the push-button safety was redesigned using a rotating lever. =Accessories= Originally the M1 carbine did not have a bayonet lug, but it was often issued with an M3 fighting knife or a bayonet converted into a fighting knife. Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug attached to the barrel band starting in 1945. However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. After the war, the bayonet lug was added to many M1 carbines during the arsenal refurbishing process. By the start of the Korean War, the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard M4 bayonet, which was based on the earlier M3 fighting knife and formed the basis for the later M5, M6 and M7 bayonet-knives. A folding-stock version of the carbine (the M1A1) was also developed after a request for a compact and light infantry arm for airborne troops. The Inland Division of General Motors manufactured 140,000 of them in two product runs in late 1942. They were originally issued to the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions but were later issued to all U.S. Army airborne units and the U.S. Marine Corps. The folding-stock M1A1 is an unusual design in that the stock is not locked in the open or closed position, but is instead held in place by a spring-loaded cam. As carbines were reconditioned, parts such as the magazine catch, rear sight, barrel band without bayonet lug, and stock were upgraded with current standard-issue parts. Also, both during and after World War II, many semi-automatic M1 carbines were converted to select-fire M2 carbines by using the T17 and T18 conversion kits. The conversion included a modified sear, slide, and trigger housing, and added a disconnector, disconnector lever, and selector switch that could be set for semi-auto or full-automatic fire. During World War II, the T23 (M3) flash hider was designed to reduce the muzzle flash from the carbine, but was not introduced into service until the advent of the M3 carbine. With the exception of T23 hiders mounted on M3 carbines, few if any T23 flash-hider attachments saw service during the war, though unit armorers occasionally hand-built improvised compensator/flash-hiders of their own design. The M1 carbine was used with the M8 grenade launcher, which was developed in early 1944. It was fired with the .30 caliber carbine M6 Grenade Blank cartridge to launch 22 mm rifle grenades. Stress from firing rifle grenades would eventually crack the carbine's stock. It also could not use the M8 launcher with an M7 auxiliary \\"booster\\" charge (to extend its range) without breaking the stock. This made it a type of emergency-issue weapon. Production American infantrymen of the 290th Regiment fight in fresh snowfall near Amonines, Belgium. Soldier in foreground is armed with an M1 carbine. A total of over 6.1 million M1 carbines of various models was manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II (compared with about 5.4 million M1 rifles and about 1.3 million Thompson submachine guns). Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies (see ¬ß Military contractors below). The largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and Rock-Ola Manufacturing Corporation. Few contractors made all the parts for carbines bearing their names: some makers bought parts from other major contractors or sub-contracted minor parts to companies like Marlin Firearms or Auto-Ordnance. Parts by all makers were required to be interchangeable. Often one company would get ahead or behind in production and parts would be shipped from one company to the other to help them catch up on their quota. When receivers were shipped for this purpose the manufacturers would often mark them for both companies. Some of the strangest combinations were the M1's made by the combined efforts of Underwood and Quality Hardware, resulting in the manufacturer mark UN-QUALITY. The receiver was subcontracted from Union Switch and Signal, not Underwood. Many carbines were refurbished at several arsenals after the war, with many parts interchanged from original maker carbines. True untouched war production carbines, therefore, are the most desirable for collectors. The M1 carbine was also one of the most cost effective weapons used by the United States military during World War II. At the beginning of World War II the average production cost for an M1 carbine was approximately $45, about half the cost of an M1 rifle at approximately $85 and about a fifth of the cost of a Thompson submachine gun at approximately $225. The .30 Caliber carbine ammunition was also far cheaper to produce than the standard .30-06 ammunition; used fewer resources, was smaller, lighter, faster and easier to make. These were major factors in the United States military decision to adopt the M1 carbine, especially when considering the vast numbers of weapons and ammunition manufactured and transported by the United States during World War II. U.S. combat use =World War II= U.S. Marine in combat at Guam. M1 carbine at first Iwo Jima flag raising. The M1 carbine with its reduced-power .30 cartridge was not originally intended to serve as a primary weapon for combat infantrymen, nor was it comparable to more powerful assault rifles developed late in the war. However, it was markedly superior to the .45 caliber submachineguns in use at the time in both accuracy and penetration, and its lighter .30 caliber cartridge allowed soldiers to carry more ammunition. As a result, the carbine was soon widely issued to infantry officers, American paratroopers, non-commissioned officers, ammunition bearers, forward artillery observers, and other frontline troops. The first M1 carbines were delivered in mid-1942, with initial priority given to troops in the European Theater of Operations (ETO). During World War II a standard U.S. Army infantry company was issued a total of 28 M1 carbines. Company headquarters was issued 9 carbines, weapons platoon was issued 16 carbines and the three rifle platoons were issued 1 each. Although, as the war progressed these numbers would vary greatly, as individual units/soldiers would often arm themselves as they saw fit. The M1 carbine gained generally high praise for its small size, light weight and firepower, especially by those troops who were unable to use a full-size rifle as their primary weapon. However, its reputation in front-line combat was mixed and negative reports began to surface with airborne operations in Sicily in 1943, and increased during the fall and winter of 1944. In the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, soldiers and guerrilla forces operating in heavy jungle with only occasional enemy contact praised the carbine for its small size, light weight, and firepower. However, soldiers and Marines engaged in frequent daily firefights (particularly those serving in the Philippines) found the weapon to have insufficient penetration and stopping power.McManus, p. 52, \\"Richard Lovett, of the U.S. Americal Division, was one of several who did not like the carbine. \\"It didn't have stopping power. Enemy soldiers were shot many times but kept on coming.\\" While carbine bullets would easily penetrate the front and back of steel helmets, as well as the body armor used by Japanese forces of the eraGeorge, John, Shots Fired In Anger NRA Press (1981), p. 450 reports of the carbine's failure to stop enemy soldiers, sometimes after multiple hits, appeared in individual after-action reports, postwar evaluations, and service histories of both the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps. The carbine's exclusive use of non-corrosive-primer ammunition was found to be a godsend by troops and ordnance personnel serving in the Pacific, where barrel corrosion was a significant issue with the corrosive primers used in .30-06 caliber weapons. However, in the ETO some soldiers reported misfires attributed to moisture ingress of the non-corrosive primer compound. Selective-fire version U.S. Marines fighting in the streets of Seoul, Korea. September 20, 1950. The M1 carbine in the foreground has the bayonet mounted. Initially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a select-fire capability, but the requirement for rapid production of the new carbine resulted in the omission of this feature from the Light Rifle Program. On 26 October 1944, in response to the Germans' widespread use of automatic weapons, especially the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle, the select-fire M2 carbine was introduced, along with a new 30-round magazine. The M2 had a fully automatic rate-of-fire of about 850‚Äì900 rounds-per-minute. Although actual M2 production began late in the war (April 1945), U.S. Ordnance issued conversion-part kits to allow field conversion of semi-auto M1 carbines to the selective-fire M2 configuration. These converted M1/M2 select-fire carbines saw limited combat service in Europe, primarily during the final Allied advance into Germany. In the Pacific, both converted and original M2 carbines saw limited use in the last days of the fighting in the Philippines. Infrared sight versions The M3 carbine was an M2 carbine with the M2 infrared night sight or sniperscope. The M3 did not have iron sights. It was first used in combat by Army units during the invasion of Okinawa, about 150 M3 carbines were used on Okinawa. For the first time, U.S. soldiers had a weapon that allowed them to visually detect Japanese infiltrating into American lines at night, even during complete darkness. A team of two or three soldiers was used to operate the weapon and provide support. At night, the scope would be used to detect Japanese patrols and assault units moving forward. At that point, the operator would fire a burst of automatic fire at the greenish images of enemy soldiers. The M3 carbine had an effective range of about 70 yards (64 meters), limited by the visual capabilities of the sight. Fog and rain further reduced the weapon's effective range. However, it is estimated that fully 30% of Japanese casualties inflicted by rifle and carbine fire during the Okinawan campaign were caused by the M3 carbine. The system was refined over time, and by the Korean War the improved M3 infrared night sight was in service. The M3 sight has a longer effective range than its predecessor, about 125 yards (114 meters). However, it still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and infrared light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. M3 operators would not only use their carbines to dispatch individual targets, but also used tracer ammo to identify troop concentrations for machine gunners to decimate. In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public. =Korean War= DP-27 machine gun. U.S. Marines holding captured Chinese Soldiers during fighting on the central Korean front. Note: M1 carbine with mounted bayonet By the Korean War, the select fire M2 carbine had largely replaced the submachine-gun in U.S. service and was the most widely used carbine variant. Although, the semi-auto M1 carbine was also widely used- especially by support troops. However, in Korea, all versions of the carbine soon acquired a widespread reputation for jamming in extreme cold weather, this being eventually traced to weak return springs, freezing of parts due to overly viscous lubricants and inadequate cartridge recoil impulse as the result of subzero temperatures. There were also many complaints from individual soldiers that the carbine bullet failed to stop heavily clothed or gear-ladenChinese troops frequently wore bandolier-type ammunition pouches and carried extra PPSh or Thompson magazines in addition to 4‚Äì5 stick grenades. North Korean and Chinese (PVA) troops even at close range and after multiple hits. Marines of the 1st Marine Division also reported instances of carbine bullets failing to stop enemy soldiers, and some units issued standing orders for carbine users to aim for the head. PVA infantry forces who had been issued captured U.S. small arms disliked the carbine for the same reason. A 1951 official U.S. Army evaluation reported that ...\\"There are practically no data bearing on the accuracy of the carbine at ranges in excess of 50 yards. The record contains a few examples of carbine-aimed fire felling an enemy soldier at this distance or perhaps a little more. But they are so few in number that no general conclusion can be drawn from them. Where carbine fire had proved killing effect, approximately 95 percent of the time the target was dropped at less than 50 yards.\\" The evaluation also reported that ...\\"Commanders noted that it took two to three engagements at least to settle their men to the automatic feature of the carbine so that they would not greatly waste ammunition under the first impulse of engagement. By experience, they would come to handle it semi-automatically, but it took prolonged battle hardening to bring about this adjustment in the human equation.\\" Despite its mixed reputation, the M2 carbine's firepower often made it the weapon of choice, when it came to night patrols in Korea. The M3 carbine with its infrared sniperscope was also used against night infiltrators, especially during the static stages of the conflict. =Vietnam War= ARVN soldiers with M1 carbines and U.S. Special Forces with M16s The M1 and M2 carbines were again issued to U.S. forces during the Vietnam War, particularly with United States Air Force Security Police and United States Army Special Forces. These weapons began to be replaced by the M16 in 1964, and they were generally out of service by 1970s, although they were used in limited numbers by U.S. troops and security personnel until the fall of Saigon in 1975. At least 793,994 M1 and M2 carbines were given to the South Vietnamese and were widely used throughout the Vietnam War. A number were captured during the war by Vietcong with some made compact by shortening the barrel and/or stock. \\"While the carbine's lighter weight and high rate of fire made it an excellent weapon for small-statured Asians, these guns lacked sufficient hitting power and penetration, and they were eventually outclassed by the AK-47 assault rifle.\\" The M1/M2/M3 carbines were the most heavily produced family of U.S. military weapons for several decades. They were used by every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Foreign usage alt= capture of Mogaung in Burma during the second Chindit expedition, June 1944. After World War II, the M1 and M2 carbines were widely exported to U.S. allies and client states (1,015,568 to South Korea, 793,994 to South Vietnam, 269,644 to France, etc.), they were used as a frontline weapon well into the Vietnam War era, and they continue to be used by military, police, and security forces around the world to this day. =British Army= During World War II, the British SAS used the M1 and M1A1 carbines after 1943. The weapon was taken into use simply because a decision had been taken by Allied authorities to supply .30 caliber weapons from U.S. stocks in the weapons containers dropped to Resistance groups sponsored by an SOE, or later also Office of Strategic Services (OSS), organizer, on the assumption the groups so supplied would be operating in areas within the operational boundaries of U.S. forces committed to Operation Overlord. They were found to be suited to the kind of operation the two British, two French, and one Belgian Regiment carried out. It was handy enough to parachute with, and, in addition, could be easily stowed in an operational Jeep. Other specialist intelligence collection units, such as 30 Assault Unit sponsored by the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty, which operated across the entire Allied area of operations, also made use of this weapon.. The carbine continued to be utilized as late as the Malayan Emergency, by the Police Field Force of the Royal Malaysian Police, along with other units of the British Army, were issued the M2 carbine for both jungle patrols and outpost defense. The Royal Ulster Constabulary also used the M1 carbine.Central Office of Information British Information Services Survey of Current Affairs 1977 H.M Stationery Office =German Army= Small numbers of captured M1 carbines were used by German forces in World War II, particularly after D-Day. The German designation for captured carbines was Selbstladekarabiner 455(a). The \\"(a)\\" came from the country name in German; in this case, Amerika. It was also used by German police and border guards in Bavaria after World War II and into the 1950s. The carbines were stamped according to the branch they were in service with; for instance, those used by the border guard were stamped \\"Bundesgrenzschutz\\". Some of these weapons were modified with different sights, finishes, and sometimes new barrels. =Japanese GSDF= A variant was produced shortly after World War II by the Japanese manufacturer Howa Machinery, under U.S. supervision. These were issued to all branches of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, and large numbers of them found their way to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. Howa also made replacement parts for US-made M1 carbines issued to Japanese police and military. = Israel Defense Forces = The M1 carbine was also used by the Israeli Palmach-based special forces in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. And, because of their compact size and semi-auto capabilities, they continued to be used by Israeli Defence Forces after the creation of Israel. The Israeli police still use the M1 carbine as a standard long gun for non-combat elements and Mash'az volunteers. = French Army = The U.S. provided France with 269,644 M1 and M2 carbines from World War II to 1963. The carbines were used by the French Paratroopers and Legionnaires, as well specialists (drivers, radio operators, engineers), during the Indo-China War, the Algerian War and the Suez Crisis. South Vietnamese Popular Force members on patrol with M1 carbines. ROK troops armed with M1 carbines during the Vietnam War. Che Guevara atop a mule in Las Villas province, Cuba, in November 1958, with an M2 Carbine. = South Vietnam = The U.S. provided the Army of the Republic of Vietnam with 793,994 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1973. Along with tens of thousands of carbines left behind by the French after the First Indochina War, the M1 and M2 carbines were the most widely issued small arm during the early stages in the Vietnam War and remained in service in large numbers until the fall of Saigon. The South Vietnamese would also receive 220,300 M1 Garands and 520 M1C/M1D rifles, and 640,000 M-16 rifles. The Vi·ªát Minh and the Viet Cong also used large numbers of M1 and M2 carbines, captured from the French, ARVN and local militia forces of South Vietnam, as well as receiving many thousands of carbines from the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), China and North Korea. Over time, the SKS and eventually the AK-47 would replace the carbine to become the dominant weapons used by the Viet Cong. = South Korea = The Republic of Korea Armed Forces received 1,015,568 M1 and M2 carbines from 1963 to 1972. Along with hundreds of thousands of Carbines and M1 Garands provided by the United States Army before, during and shortly after the Korean war, South Korea would become the largest single recipient of American M1 and M2 carbines. South Korea also took an active role in the Vietnam War. From 1964 to 1973, South Korea sent more than 300,000 troops to South Vietnam armed primarily with M1 and M2 carbines, as well as M1 Garands. = Philippines = The government of the Philippines still issues M1 carbines to the infantrymen of the Philippine Army's 2nd Infantry Division assigned in Luzon Island (some units are issued just M14 automatic rifles and M1 carbines) and the Civilian Auxiliary Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) and Civilian Volunteer Organizations (CVO)spread throughout the Philippines. Certain provincial police units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) still use government- issue M1 carbines as well as some operating units of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). In many provinces of the Philippines, M1 carbines are still highly valued as a light small arm. Elements of the New People's Army and Islamic Secessionist movement value the carbine as a lightweight weapon and preferred choice for mountain and ambush operations. The M1 carbine has become one of the most recognized firearms in Philippine society, with the Marikina City-based company ARMSCOR Philippines still continuing to manufacture .30 caliber ammunition for the Philippine market. = Latin America = The M1 and M2 carbines were widely used by military, police, and security forces and their opponents during the many guerrilla and civil wars throughout Latin America until the 1990s, when they were mostly replaced by more modern designs. A notable user was Che Guevara who used them during the Cuban Revolution and in Bolivia where he was executed by a Bolivian soldier armed with an M2 carbine. Guevara's fellow revolutionary Camilo Cienfuegos also used an M2 carbine that he modified with the pistol grip and foregrip from a Thompson submachine gun. Cienfuegos' carbine is on display in the Museum of the Revolution (Cuba). In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a police battalion named Batalh√£o de Opera√ß√µes Policiais Especiais (BOPE, or \\"Special Police Operations Battalion\\") still uses the M1 carbine.

Inland production of M1A1 carbines was interspersed with Inland production of M1 carbines with the standard stock. Stocks were often swapped out as carbines were refurbished at arsenals. An original Inland carbine with an original M1A1 stock is rare today. =Carbine, Cal .30, M1A2= * Proposed variant with improved sight adjustable for windage and elevation * Produced only as 'overstamped' model (an arsenal-refurbished M1 with new rear sight and other late M1 improvements) =Carbine, Cal .30, M1A3= * Underside-folding pantograph stock, 15-round magazine. * Type standardized to replace the M1A1 but may not have been issued. * Pantograph stock was more rigid than the M1A1's folding stock and folded flush under the fore end.

Exploded view of the M2 Carbine. * Early 1945 * Selective fire (capable of fully automatic fire) * 30-round magazine or 15 standard issue * About 600,000 produced Initially, the M1 carbine was intended to have a selective-fire capability, but the decision was made to put the M1 into production without this feature. Fully automatic capability was incorporated into the design of the M2 (an improved, selective-fire version of the M1), introduced in 1944. The M2 featured the late M1 improvements to the rear sight, addition of a bayonet lug, and other minor changes. Research into a conversion kit for selective fire began May 1944; the first kit was developed by Inland engineers, and known as the T4. Inland was awarded a contract for 500 T4 carbines in September 1944. Although the conversion was seen as satisfactory, the heavier 30-round magazine put greater strain on the magazine catch, necessitating the development of a sturdier catch. The slide, sear, and stock design also had to be modified. On fully automatic fire, the T4 model could fire about 750 rounds per minute, but generated a manageable recoil. Although some carbines were marked at the factory as M2, the only significant difference between an M1 and M2 carbine is in the fire control group. The military issued field conversion kits (T17 and T18) to convert an M1 to an M2. Legally a carbine marked M2 is always a machine gun for national firearms registry purposes. These M2 parts including the heavier M2 stock were standardized for arsenal rebuild of M1 and M1A1 carbines. A modified round bolt replaced the original flat top bolt to save machining steps in manufacture. Many sources erroneously refer to this round bolt as an 'M2 bolt' but it was developed as a standard part for new manufacture M1 and later M2 carbines and as a replacement part, with priority given to use on M1A1 and M2 carbines. The slightly heavier round bolt did moderate the cyclic rate of the M2 on full automatic. Despite being in demand, very few M2 carbines saw use during World War II, and then mostly in the closing days against Japan. The M2 carbine was logistically compatible with the millions of M1 carbines in U.S. service, and offered longer range, better accuracy and better penetration than (pistol caliber) submachine guns like the M1 Thompsons and M3 Grease Guns.America's Favorite Gun. by Gold V. Sanders. Popular Science Aug 1944. pp. 84‚Äì87, 221 Therefore, after World War II, the M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine-guns in U.S. service, until it was itself replaced by the M16 rifle. The M2 model was the most widely used Carbine variant during the Korean War. A detailed study of the effectiveness of the M2 in the war was assembled by S. L. A. Marshall. He found that many troops complained on the lack of effective range of the gun, which allowed the enemy to get close enough to throw hand grenades. A more detailed analysis showed however that most troops who complained actually tended to run low on ammo, because they fired their M2 on fully automatic too soon. Troops who fired their guns on semi-automatic at distance generally complained less about the M2's effectiveness. Generally, the more seasoned troops used the latter approach. The carbine was usually given to second line troops (administrative, support, etc.), who had little combat experience and also did not have much training in small-unit tactics, but who usually had to engage the enemy at some critical moment, like a breakthrough or ambush. Marshall noted that almost all killing shots with carbines in Korea were at ranges of 50 yards or less. It was unsurprising therefore that the M2 was a preferred weapon for night patrols. The M2 was also used in the early stages of the Vietnam War by special forces, ARVN advisers, and air crews. Contemporary authors have struggled to categorize the M2 carbine. On one hand, it is more powerful than a submachine gun and is considered by some to be an assault rifle, even though it fires a projectile considerably less powerful than the StG 44's 7.92√ó33mm Kurz. On the other hand, the M2 can also be considered a precursor of the modern personal defense weapon (PDW) concept, even though contemporary guns in that category, like the FN P90, fire substantially different cartridges like the 5.7√ó28mm. =Carbine, Cal. 30, M2A2= * Arsenal-refurbished (overstamped M2) model =Carbine, Cal .30, M3= * M2 with mounting (T3 mount) for an early active (infrared) night vision sight * About 3,000 produced * Three versions of night sight (M1, M2, M3) Original Korean War era USMC M3 Night Vision Scope The M3 carbine was an M2 carbine fitted with a mount designed to accept an infrared sight for use at night. It was initially used with the M1 sniperscope, and an active infrared sight, and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa. Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, and by the time of the Korean War, the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope. The M2 sniper scope extended the effective nighttime range of the M3 carbine to 100 yards. In the later stages of the Korean War, an improved version of the M3 carbine, with a revised mount, a forward pistol grip, and a new M3 sniperscope design was used in the latter stages of Korea and briefly in Vietnam. The M3 sniperscope had a large active infrared spotlight mounted on top of the scope body itself, allowing use in the prone position. The revised M3/M3 had an effective range of around 125 yards. Eventually, the M3 carbine and its M3 sniperscope would be superseded by passive-design night vision scopes with extended visible ranges; the improved scopes in turn required the use of rifle-caliber weapons with flatter trajectories and increased hit probability. Derivatives =Ingram SAM= The Ingram SAM rifles are M1 carbine derivatives in 5.56√ó45mm NATO (SAM-1), 7.62√ó39mm (SAM-2) and 7.62√ó51mm NATO (SAM-3). The 5.56√ó45mm versions accept M16 magazines, the 7.62√ó39mm accept AK magazines and the 7.62√ó51mm versions use FN FAL magazines. They did not catch on in competition against the Ruger Mini-14 in both the police and civilian markets. The Ingram SAM rifles are occasionally found on auction sites for collectors. = 9√ó19mm Parabellum = Iver Johnson's 9√ó19mm Parabellum Carbine was introduced in 1985 until 1986 using modified Browning High Power 20 round magazines. Chiappa Firearms produces a 9mm M1 carbine derivative called the M1-9 which uses Beretta M9/92FS magazines. The Chiappa is not Gas operated and instead relies on Blowback operation.

Some companies used a combination of original USGI and new commercial parts, while others manufactured entire firearms from new parts, which may or may not be of the same quality as the originals. These copies were marketed to the general public and police agencies but were not made for or used by the U.S. military. In 1963, firearms designer Melvin M. Johnson introduced a version of the M1 carbine called the \\"Spitfire\\" that fired a 5.7 mm (.22 in) wildcat cartridge known as the 5.7 mm MMJ or .22 Spitfire. The Spitfire fired a 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2850 ft/s (870 m/s) for a muzzle energy of . Johnson advertised the smaller caliber and the modified carbine as a survival rifle for use in jungles or other remote areas. While the concept had some military application when used for this role in the selective-fire M2 carbine, it was not pursued, and few Spitfire carbines were made. An Auto-Ordnance AOM-130 Carbine manufactured in 2007. More recently, the Auto-Ordnance division of Kahr Arms began production of an M1 carbine replica in 2005 based on the typical M1 carbine as issued in 1944, without the later adjustable sight or barrel band with bayonet lug. The original Auto- Ordnance had produced various parts for IBM carbine production during World War II, but did not manufacture complete carbines until the introduction of this replica. The AOM110 and AOM120 models (no longer produced) featured birch stocks and handguards, Parkerized receivers, flip-style rear sights and barrel bands without bayonet lugs. The current AOM130 and AOM140 models are identical except for American walnut stocks and handguards. In 2014, Inland Manufacturing, LLC in Dayton, Ohio introduced the reproduction of the \\"Inland M1 Carbine\\". Inland Manufacturing, LLC is a private entity that is producing reproductions of the M1 Carbine and M1A1 Paratrooper models that were built by the original Inland Division of General Motors from 1941 to 1945. The new Inland M1 carbines feature many of the same characteristics of the original Inland Carbines and are manufactured in the USA. The M1 carbine is modeled after the last production model that Inland manufactured in 1945 and features a type 3 bayonet lug / barrel band, adjustable rear sights, push button safety, round bolt, and \\"low wood\\" walnut stock, and a 15-round magazine. A 30-round mag catch was utilized to allow high-capacity magazines. A \\"1944\\" M1 Carbine is also available that has the same features as the 1945 only with a Type 2 barrel Band and 10-round magazine and is available for sale in most states with magazine capacity & bayonet lug restrictions. The M1A1 is modeled after a late production 1944 M1A1 Paratrooper model with a folding \\"low wood\\" walnut stock, Type two barrel band, and includes the same adjustable sights which were actually introduced in 1944.

However, beginning in 1968, the company began producing the \\"New Carbine\\", which externally resembled the M1 but was in fact a completely new firearm internally, using a different receiver, bolt carrier, bolt, recoil spring assembly, etc. with almost no interchangeability with GI-issue carbines. Universal was acquired by Iver Johnson in 1983 and moved to Jacksonville, Ark. in 1985. * Williams Gun Sight of Davison, Mich. produced a series of 50 sporterized M1 Carbines Hunting and civilian use Patty Hearst holding a sawed-off M1 \\"Enforcer\\" Carbine during her infamous bank robbery attempt. After World War II, the M1 carbine became a popular plinking and ranch rifle. It is still popular with civilian shooters around the world and is prized as a historically significant collector's item. The Carbine continues to be used in military marksmanship training and competitive target matches conducted by rifle clubs affiliated with the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP). The M1 carbine can be used for hunting animals such as white-tailed deer and mule deer at close range (less than 100 yards), but is definitely underpowered for larger North American game such as elk, moose, and bear. A standard .30 Carbine soft-point round weighs and has a muzzle velocity of about giving it about of energy. By comparison, a 110gr .357 Magnum bullet fired from an 18\\" rifle barrel, has a muzzle velocity of 1718 ft/s (523 m/s) and 720 ft-lb (976 joules) of muzzle energy. 30 Carbine sporting ammunition is factory recommended for hunting and control of large varmints like coyote, fox or bobcat. Some U.S. states prohibit use of the .30 Carbine cartridge for hunting deer and larger animals due to a lessened chance of killing an animal in a single shot, even with expanding bullets. The M1 Carbine is also prohibited for hunting in several states such as Pennsylvania because of the semi-automatic function, and Illinois which prohibits all non- muzzleloading rifles for big game hunting. Five-round magazines are commercially made for use in states that limit the capacity of semi-automatic hunting rifles. Some indoor shooting ranges may permit the use of an M-1 Carbine, as its bullet is comparable to magnum handgun rounds, whereas a .223, 7.62x39 or other rifle rounds might penetrate or damage the backstop. Since about 1990, New Jersey has listed the \\"M-1 Carbine Type\\" as a banned assault firearm although many examples of the M1 Carbine technically meet the restrictions on semi-automatic rifles identified by the state's firearm laws. Police Officers, Active Duty Military or veterans in living in New Jersey are also banned form owning or possessing an M1 Carbine. Although not specifically banned by name, make or model, M1 Carbines may in some cases be classified as assault weapons under the 2013 NY SAFE act if the rifle has features such as bayonet lugs, pistol grips, folding stocks and flash suppressors. 10-round magazines are available for owners in New York and states that restrict magazine capacity for civilian firearms. Although 5 round magazines have been produced, they are not very commonly found. The M1 Carbine was also used by various law enforcement agencies and prison guards, and was prominently carried by riot police during the civil unrest of the late 1960s and early 1970s; until it was replaced in those roles by more modern .223 caliber semi- automatic rifles such as the Ruger Mini-14 and the Colt AR-15 type rifles in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The ease of use and great adaptability of the weapon led to it being used by Malcolm X and Patty Hearst. Both were featured in famous news photographs carrying a version the carbine.

One player takes the role of \\"Simon\\" and issues instructions (usually physical actions such as \\"jump in the air\\" or \\"stick out your tongue\\") to the other players, which should be followed only when prefaced with the phrase \\"Simon says\\". Players are eliminated from the game by either following instructions that are not immediately preceded by the phrase, or by failing to follow an instruction which does include the phrase \\"Simon says\\". It is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake commands, rather than physical ability, that usually matters in the game; in most cases, the action just needs to be attempted. In many regions of the United States, Simon says is also known as \\"Simon Sez\\". The object for the player acting as Simon is to get all the other players out as quickly as possible; the winner of the game is usually the last player who has successfully followed all of the given commands. Occasionally, however, two or more of the last players may all be eliminated at the same time, thus resulting in Simon winning the game. The game is embedded in popular culture, with numerous references in films, music, and literature. Other languages This game has translated across multiple cultures from seemingly common routes and some international versions also use the name Simon such as: * Afrikaans: \\"Kolonel Bevel\\" (\\"Colonel commands\\") * Arabic: for example :\\"ŸÜÿ®ŸäŸÑÿ© ŸÇÿßŸÑÿ™ ŸáÿßŸÉÿß\\" \\"(Algeria) Nabila said like so or \\"ŸÇÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπŸÑŸëŸÖ\\" (\\"The teacher says\\", Lebanon) and \\"ÿ≥ŸÑŸÖÿßŸÜ ŸäŸÇŸàŸÑ\\" (\\"Salman says\\", Iraq) * Basque: \\"Buruak dio\\" or \\"Buruzagiak dio\\" (The leader says), or \\"Unaik dio\\" (Unai says) * Bengali: \\"‡¶®‡ßá‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá‡¶®\\" (\\"The leader says\\") * Cantonese Chinese: \\"ËÄÅÂ∏´Ë©±\\" (\\"The teacher says\\") * Czech: \\"Simon ≈ô√≠k√°\\" (or with similar rules \\"V≈°echno l√≠t√°, co pe≈ô√≠ m√°\\") * Danish: \\"Simon siger\\", \\"Kongen befaler\\" * Dutch: \\"Commando\\" (the Dutch noun for \\"command\\"), or \\"Jantje zegt\\" (\\"Johnny says\\") in Flemish parts of Belgium * Finnish: \\"Kapteeni k√§skee\\" (\\"The captain commands\\") * French: \\"Jacques a dit\\" (\\"Jack said\\") in France, or \\"Jean dit\\" (\\"John says\\") in Quebec * Filipino: \\"Sabi ni Simon\\" * German: \\"Kommando Pimperle\\" (or with similar rules \\"Alle V√∂gel fliegen hoch\\") * Greek: \\"Œü Œ£ŒπŒºœéŒΩ ŒªŒ≠ŒµŒπ\\" ('O Sim√≥n l√©i') * Hebrew: \\"◊î◊®◊¶◊ú ◊ê◊û◊®\\" (\\"Herzl said\\") * Hungarian: \\"Simon mondja\\" * Icelandic: \\"S√≠mon segir\\" * Irish: \\"Deir S√≠om√≥n\\" * Japanese: \\"ËàπÈï∑„Åï„Çì„ÅÆÂëΩ‰ª§\\" ('Sench≈ç-san no meirei', \\"Ship Captain's orders\\") * Korean: \\"ÏãúÎ™¨ Í∞ÄÎùºÏÇ¨ÎåÄ\\" (\\"Simon says\\") * Marathi: \\"‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§π‡§£‡§æ‡§≤‡•á\\" (\\"Shivaji Maharaj says\\") * Mandarin ChineseÔºö\\"ËÄÅÂ∏àËØ¥\\"ÔºàL«éoshƒ´shu≈ç, \\"The teacher says\\"Ôºâ * Norwegian: \\"Kongen befaler\\" (\\"The king commands\\") * Polish: \\"Szymon m√≥wi\\" * Portuguese: \\"O rei manda\\" (\\"the king orders\\"), or \\"O mestre mandou\\" (\\"The master ordered\\") in Brazilian Portuguese * Spanish: \\"Mando, mando\\" (\\"I command, I command\\"), or \\"Simon dice\\" (\\"Simon says\\") * Turkish: \\"Yakup der ki\\" (\\"Jacob says\\") * Vietnam: \\"T√¥i b·∫£o\\" (\\"I say\\") * Russian: \\"–°–∞–π–º–æ–Ω –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç\\" (\\"Simon says\\") A version also exists in India, Pakistan, Germany, Slovakia, Czechia and Hungary where an analogy to what can fly and what cannot is emphasized instead of Simon saying or not, i.e. \\"Chidiya ud\\" (Hindi) which translates to Bird fly or \\"Alle V√∂gel fliegen hoch\\" (German) which is \\"All birds fly up\\". The term 'bird' can then be replaced with a thing that cannot fly. These games are usually played more with gestures than actual jumping. In a Swedish version, G√∂r si, g√∂r s√• (\\"Do this, do thus\\"), the leader says either \\"do this\\" or \\"do thus\\" while performing an action. For failing to follow the correct command, \\"do this\\", or following the wrong command, \\"do thus\\", a child must sit down until a new leader is chosen. In the late 1930s in New Zealand, non commissioned officers were leading troops in a brain stimulation game as part of training classed as informal activities called, 'do this, do that.' Gameplay A command starting with \\"Simon says\\" means that the players must obey that command. A command without the beginning \\"Simon says\\" means do not do this action. Anyone who breaks one of these two rules is eliminated from the remainder of the game. Often, anyone who speaks is also eliminated. There can be very complex and difficult command chains, such as \\"Simon says: Arms up. Simon says: Arms down. Arms up.\\" Anyone ending with their arms up is eliminated, because a command that doesn't begin with \\"Simon says\\" cannot be obeyed. A variation on the instruction phrases is used. \\"Simon says\\" is said once at the start of a series of instructions, and an action along with the phrase \\"do this\\" must be obeyed while an action with the phrase \\"do that\\" must not be obeyed. Obeying a \\"do that\\" command or not obeying a \\"do this\\" command will eliminate a player. It is considered cheating to give impossible commands (\\"Simon says, lift both of your legs up and keep them there!\\") or phrase the commands in such a way that the other player has no option but to 'go out' (\\"Simon says, jump up. Come down.\\"). However, at least in some versions, it is allowed for Simon to eliminate players by asking them to do something seemingly unrelated to the game (example: \\"Anyone remaining join me up here.\\"). Cultural references *The phrase has been used multiple times as a plot device in films and television dramas including Die Hard with a Vengeance, Police Academy, Demolition Man, The Gift and the TV series Underdog and Supernatural, as well as being played in television game shows including 1970s show Superstars and Battle of the Network Reality Stars. *The phrase occurs twice in Thelma and Louise for comic effect: \\"Simon says everybody lay down on the floor.\\" First the outlaw on the run character J.D. (Brad Pitt) tells how he usually sets off to do an armed robbery. Later on we find out in the only flashback scene of the movie that Thelma (Geena Davis) uses exactly the same phrase when robbing a store. *In an episode of the Cartoon Network show Courage the Cowardly Dog, the title character (disguised as an eggplant) gives commands to the other eggplants after saying \\"The Great Eggplant says\\". *The Peanuts special It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown includes a song/dance number called \\"Lucy Says\\" where Lucy plays the role of Simon, but uses \\"Lucy Says\\" instead of \\"Simon Says\\". *In the Animaniacs episode, \\"King Yakko\\", Yakko, as king of Anvilania gets his men to take their seats, but when they are about to do so, Yakko stops them, saying, \\"I didn't say 'Simon Says'!\\" Then he tells them, \\"Simon says take your seats!\\" which they follow. *A stunt played on the game show Fun House also played Simon Says, but was changed to \\"Tiny Says\\" to match the name of the show's announcer giving the commands. *The electronic game Simon is named for Simon Says. *Jim Henson's Pajanimals has the Pajanimals play a similar game called \\"Cowbella Says.\\" Similar to the Peanuts example above, Cowbella, one of the Pajanimals, plays the role of Simon and uses \\"Cowbella Says\\" instead of \\"Simon Says\\". Before they play, there is a short song that has the lyrics \\"If Cowbella says, 'Cowbella Says,' you must do what Cowbella says; and if she doesn't say 'Cowbella Says,' you must not do what Cowbella says!\\" *Mickey Mouskersize, a short in Disney Junior has a game called Mickey Says. Mickey plays the role of Simon, once in the middle of the game, Goofy and Minnie did what Mickey said when he did not say \\"Mickey Says\\". *In Let's Go Pocoyo, there is a game in some episodes called Fred Says. This is a simple game. Fred plays the role of Simon, however, the narrator always says \\"Fred Says\\" in each phrase. At the end, the narrator says \\"Fred Says: That's all.\\" *In Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚Äì Dual Destinies, the game's main prosecutor is Simon Blackquill, likely named after the game. He's a master of psychological manipulation, and his acts of manipulating the minds of others is compared to as Simon Says by other characters. *In an episode of Transformers: Rescue Bots, Cody uses the game to teach the Bots about obeying commands. He uses basic instructions such as \\"Turn right\\" and \\"raise your left arm\\".

The term is typically used to refer to the end of the 19th century. This period was widely thought to be a period of degeneracy, but at the same time a period of hope for a new beginning.Schaffer, Talia. Literature and Culture at the Fin de Si√®cle. New York: Longman, 2007. 3. The \\"spirit\\" of fin de si√®cle often refers to the cultural hallmarks that were recognized as prominent in the 1880s and 1890s, including ennui, cynicism, pessimism, and \\"...a widespread belief that civilization leads to decadence.\\"Me≈°troviƒá, Stjepan G.

The term \\"fin de si√®cle\\" is commonly applied to French art and artists, as the traits of the culture first appeared there, but the movement affected many European countries.McGuinness, Patrick (Ed.)Symbolism, Decadence and the Fin de Si√®cle: French and European Perspectives.

The term becomes applicable to the sentiments and traits associated with the culture, as opposed to focusing solely on the movement's initial recognition in France. The ideas and concerns developed by fin de si√®cle artists provided the impetus for movements such as symbolism and modernism.Has-Ellison, J.Trygve. \\"Nobles, Modernism, and the Culture of fin-de-si√®cle Munich.\\" German History 26(1), 2008: 1‚Äì23, 2. .

Professor of Historical Geography at the University of Nottingham, Michael Heffernan, and Mackubin Thomas Owens wrote about the origins of geopolitics: \\"The idea that this project required a new name in 1899 reflected a widespread belief that the changes taking place in the global economic and political system were seismically important.\\" The \\"new world of the Twentieth century would need to be understood in its entirety, as an integrated global whole.\\" Technology and global communication made the world \\"smaller\\" and turned it into a single system; the time was characterized by pan-ideas and a utopian \\"one-worldism\\", proceeding further than pan-ideas.Michael Heffernan, \\"Fin de Si√®cle, Fin du Monde? On the Origins of European Geopolitics; 1890‚Äì1920,\\" Geopolitical Traditions: A Century of Geopolitical Thought, (eds.Klaus Dodds, & David A.

The major political theme of the era was that of revolt against materialism, rationalism, positivism, bourgeois society, and liberal democracy. The fin-de-si√®cle generation supported emotionalism, irrationalism, subjectivism, and vitalism, while the mindset of the age saw civilization as being in a crisis that required a massive and total solution. Fin-de-si√®cle syndrome Michael Heffernan in his article \\"Fin de Si√®cle, Fin du Monde?\\" (2000) finds in the Christian world what he calls \\"the syndrome of fin de si√®cle\\". In 2000 this took the form of the Year 2000 problem. Fins de si√®cle are accompanied by future expectations: Degeneration theory Arthur Schopenhauer, German philosopher, whose philosophy influenced the culture of fin de si√®cle. B. A. Morel's degeneration theory holds that although societies can progress, they can also remain static or even regress if influenced by a flawed environment, such as national conditions or outside cultural influences.Hambrook, Glyn. \\"Baudelaire, Degeneration Theory, and Literary Criticism\\". The Modern Language Review. 101.4 (2006): 1005‚Äì1024. . This degeneration can be passed from generation to generation, resulting in imbecility and senility due to hereditary influence. Max Nordau's Degeneration holds that the two dominant traits of those degenerated in a society involve ego mania and mysticism. The former term was understood to mean a pathological degree of self-absorption and unreasonable attention to one's own sentiments and activities, as can be seen in the extremely descriptive nature of minute details; the latter referred to the impaired ability to translate primary perceptions into fully developed ideas, largely noted in symbolist works.Goldfarb, Russel. \\"Late Victorian Decadence.\\" The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 20.4 (1962): 369‚Äì373. . Nordau's treatment of these traits as degenerative qualities lends to the perception of a world falling into decay through fin de si√®cle corruptions of thought, and influencing the pessimism growing in Europe's philosophical consciousness. As fin de si√®cle citizens, attitudes tended toward science in an attempt to decipher the world in which they lived. The focus on psycho-physiology, now psychology, was a large part of fin de si√®cle societyMaxwell, Catherine. \\"Theodore Watts- Dunton's 'Aylwin (1898)' and the Reduplications of Romanticism.\\" The Yearbook of English Studies 37.1 (2007): 1‚Äì21. . in that it studied a topic that could not be depicted through Romanticism, but relied on traits exhibited to suggest how the mind works, as does symbolism. The concept of genius returned to popular consciousness around this period through Max Nordau's work with degeneration, prompting study of artists supposedly affected by social degeneration and what separates imbecility from genius. The genius and the imbecile were determined to have largely similar character traits, including les delires des grandeurs and la folie du doute. The first, which means delusions of grandeur, begins with a disproportionate sense of importance in one's own activities and results in a sense of alienation,\\"What Is Fin de Siecle?\\" The Art Critic 1.1 (1893): 9. . as Nordau describes in Baudelaire, as well as the second characteristic of madness of doubt, which involves intense indecision and extreme preoccupation with minute detail. The difference between degenerate genius and degenerate madman become the extensive knowledge held by the genius in a few areas paired with a belief in one's own superiority as a result. Together, these psychological traits lend to originality, eccentricity, and a sense of alienation, all symptoms of le mal du si√®cle that impacted French youth at the beginning of the 19th century until expanding outward and eventually influencing the rest of Europe approaching the turn of the century.Shrimpton, Nicholas. Lane, You're a Perfect Pessimist': Pessimism and the English 'Fin de si√®cle. The Yearbook of English Studies 37.1 (2007): 41‚Äì57. . The Belgian symbolist Fernand Khnopff's The Caress Pessimism Aesthetic writer Oscar Wilde England's ideological space was affected by the philosophical waves of pessimism sweeping Europe, starting with philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's work from before 1860 and gradually influencing artists internationally. R. H. Goodale identified 235 essays by British and American authors concerning pessimism, ranging from 1871 to 1900, showing the prominence of pessimism in conjunction with English ideology. Further, Oscar Wilde's references to pessimism in his works demonstrate the relevance of the ideology on the English. In An Ideal Husband, Wilde's protagonist asks another character whether \\"at heart, [she is] an optimist or a pessimist? Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.\\" Wilde's reflection on personal philosophy as more culturally significant than religion lends credence to degeneration theory, as applied to Baudelaire's influence on other nations. However, the optimistic Romanticism popular earlier in the century would also have affected the shifting ideological landscape. The newly fashionable pessimism appears again in Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, written that same year: Lane is philosophically current as of 1895, reining in his master's optimism about the weather by reminding Algernon of how the world typically operates. His pessimism gives satisfaction to Algernon; the perfect servant of a gentleman is one who is philosophically aware. Charles Baudelaire's work demonstrates some of the pessimism expected of the time, and his work with modernity exemplified the decadence and decay with which turn-of-the-century French art is associated, while his work with symbolism promoted the mysticism Nordau associated with fin de si√®cle artists. Baudelaire's pioneering translations of Edgar Allan Poe's verse supports the aesthetic role of translation in fin de si√®cle culture,Thain, Marion. \\"Modernist 'Homage' to the 'Fin de si√®cle. The Yearbook of English Studies 37.1 (2007): 22‚Äì40. . while his own works influenced French and English artists through the use of modernity and symbolism. Baudelaire influenced other French artists like Arthur Rimbaud, the author of Ren√© whose titular character displays the mal du si√®cle that European youths of the age displayed. Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and their contemporaries became known as French decadents, a group that influenced its English counterpart, the aesthetes like Oscar Wilde. Both groups believed the purpose of art was to evoke an emotional response and demonstrate the beauty inherent in the unnatural as opposed to trying to teach its audience an infallible sense of morality.Quintus, John Allen. \\"The Moral Implications of Oscar Wilde's Aestheticism.\\" Texas Studies in Literature and Language 22.4 (1980): 559‚Äì574. . Literary conventions In the Victorian fin de si√®cle, the themes of degeneration and anxiety are expressed not only through the physical landscape which provided a backdrop for Gothic Literature, but also through the human body itself. Works such as Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886); Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891); Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan (1894); H.G. Wells' The Time Machine (1895) and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) all explore themes of change, development, evolution, mutation, corruption and decay in relation to the human body and mind. These literary conventions were a direct reflection of many evolutionary, scientific, social and medical theories and advancements that emerged toward the end of the 19th century. Artistic conventions At the Moulin Rouge (1895), a painting by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec that captures the vibrant and decadent spirit of society during the fin de si√®cle The works of the Decadents and the Aesthetes contain the hallmarks typical of fin de si√®cle art. Holbrook Jackson's The Eighteen Nineties describes the characteristics of English decadence, which are: perversity, artificiality, egoism, and curiosity. The first trait is the concern for the perverse, unclean, and unnatural. Romanticism encouraged audiences to view physical traits as indicative of one's inner self, whereas the fin de si√®cle artists accepted beauty as the basis of life, and so valued that which was not conventionally beautiful.The Scream (1893), an expressionist painting by Edvard Munch is a prominent cultural symbol of fin de si√®cle era.West, Shearer. Fin de Siecle: Art and Society in an Age of Uncertainty. Overlook Press. This belief in beauty in the abject leads to the obsession with artifice and symbolism, as artists rejected ineffable ideas of beauty in favour of the abstract. Through symbolism, aesthetes could evoke sentiments and ideas in their audience without relying on an infallible general understanding of the world. The third trait of the culture is egoism, a term similar to that of ego-mania, meaning disproportionate attention placed on one's own endeavours. This can result in a type of alienation and anguish, as in Baudelaire's case, and demonstrates how aesthetic artists chose cityscapes over country as a result of their aversion to the natural. Finally, curiosity is identifiable through diabolism and the exploration of the evil or immoral, focusing on the morbid and macabre, but without imposing any moral lessons on the audience.

In 1661, Koxinga defeated the Dutch outposts on Formosa and established a dynasty, the House of Koxinga, which ruled the island as the Kingdom of Tungning from 1661 to 1683. Life =Early years= Zheng Sen was born in 1624 in Hirado, Hizen Province, Japan, to Zheng Zhilong, a Chinese merchant and pirate, and a Japanese woman, recorded only by her surname \\"Tagawa\\"; . or probably Tagawa Matsu. He was raised there until the age of seven with the Japanese name and then moved to Nan'an county in Quanzhou in Fujian province of China. In 1638, Zheng became a Xiucai (a successful candidate) in the imperial examination and became one of the twelve Linshansheng () of Nan'an. In 1641, Koxinga married the niece of Dong Yangxian, an official who was a Jinshi from Hui'an. In 1644, Koxinga studied at the Imperial Nanking University, where he met the scholar Qian Qianyi and became his student.Carioti, \\"The Zhengs' Maritime Power in the International Context of the 17th Century Far East Seas: The Rise of a 'Centralised Piratical Organisation' and Its Gradual Development into an Informal 'State'\\", p. 41, n. 29. In 1644, Beijing fell to rebels led by Li Zicheng and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on a tree at modern-day Jingshan Park in Beijing. Manchu armies aided by Wu Sangui's forces defeated the rebels and took the city. The Ming remnant forces retreated to Nanjing where they put Prince Fu on the throne as the Hongguang Emperor in an attempt to continue the Ming dynasty in the south. The next year, the Manchu armies led by Dodo advanced south and conquered Yangzhou and Nanjing while the Ming leader defending Yangzhou, Shi Kefa, was killed. The Hongguang emperor was captured and executed. =Under the Longwu Emperor= In 1645, Prince Tang was installed on the throne of the Southern Ming as the Longwu Emperor with support from Zheng Zhilong and his family. The Longwu Emperor established his court in Fuzhou, which was controlled by the Zhengs. In the later part of the year, another Ming Prince Lu proclaimed himself as Regent () in Shaoxing and established his own court there. Although Prince Lu and Longwu's regimes stemmed from the same dynasty, each pursued different goals. Due to the natural defences of Fujian and the military resources of the Zheng family, the emperor was able to remain safe for some time. The Longwu Emperor granted Zheng Zhilong's son, Zheng Sen, a new given name, Chenggong (), and the title of Koxinga (\\"Lord of the Imperial Surname\\"). One of his cousins also had it. In 1646, Koxinga first led the Ming armies to resist the Manchu invaders and won the favour of the Longwu Emperor. The Longwu Emperor's reign in Fuzhou was brief, as Zheng Zhilong refused to support his plans for a counter-offensive against the rapidly expanding forces of the newly established Qing dynasty by the Manchus. Zheng Zhilong ordered the defending general of Xianxia Pass (), Shi Fu (a.k.a. Shi Tianfu, a relative of Shi Lang), to retreat to Fuzhou even when Qing armies approached Fujian. For this reason, the Qing army faced little resistance when it conquered the north of the pass. In September 1646, Qing armies broke through the inadequately defended mountain passes and entered Fujian. Zheng Zhilong retreated to his coastal fortress and the Longwu Emperor faced the Qing armies alone. Longwu's forces were destroyed; he was captured and was executed in October 1646. =Zheng Zhilong's surrender and the death of Tagawa= The Qing forces sent envoys to meet Zheng Zhilong secretly and offered to appoint him as the governor of both Fujian and Guangdong provinces if he would surrender to the Qing. Zheng Zhilong agreed and ignored the objections of his family, surrendering himself to the Qing forces in Fuzhou on 21 November 1646. Koxinga and his uncles were left as the successors to the leadership of Zheng Zhilong's military forces. Koxinga operated outside Xiamen and recruited many to join his cause in a few months. He used the superiority of his naval forces to launch amphibious raids on Manchu-occupied territory in Fujian and he managed to take Tong'an in Quanzhou prefecture in early 1647. However, Koxinga's forces lacked the ability to defend the newly occupied territory. Following the fall of Tong'an to Zheng, the Manchus launched a counterattack in the spring of 1647, during which they stormed the Zheng family's hometown of Anping. Koxinga's mother, Lady Tagawa, had come from Japan in 1645 to join her family in Fujian (Koxinga's younger brother, Tagawa Shichizaemon, remained in Japan). She did not follow her husband to surrender to the Qing Dynasty. She was caught by Manchu forces in Anping and committed suicide after refusal to submit to the enemy, according to traditional accounts. =Resistance to the Qing= Zheng Chenggong statue in Xiamen, Fujian, China. The granite statue is tall and weighs . By 1650, Koxinga was strong enough to establish himself as the head of the Zheng family. He pledged allegiance to the only remaining claimant to the throne of the Ming Dynasty, the Yongli Emperor. The Yongli Emperor was fleeing from the Manchus in south-western China with a motley court and hastily assembled army at the time. Despite one fruitless attempt, Koxinga was unable to do anything to aid the last Ming emperor. Instead, he decided to concentrate on securing his own position on the southeast coast. Koxinga enjoyed a series of military successes in 1651 and 1652 that increased the Qing government's anxiety over the threat he posed. Zheng Zhilong wrote a letter to his son from Beijing, presumably at the request of the Shunzhi Emperor and the Qing government, urging his son to negotiate with the Manchurians. The long series of negotiations between Koxinga and the Qing Dynasty lasted until November 1654. The negotiations ultimately failed. The Qing government then appointed Prince Jidu (son of Jirgalang) to lead an attack on Koxinga's territory after this failure. On 9 May 1656, Jidu's armies attacked Kinmen (Quemoy), an island near Xiamen that Koxinga had been using to train his troops. Partly as a result of a major storm, the Manchus were defeated, and they lost most of their fleet in the battle. Koxinga had sent one of his naval commanders to capture Zhoushan island prior to Jidu's attack, and now that the Manchus were temporarily without an effective naval force in the Fujian area, Koxinga was free to send a huge army to Zhoushan, which he intended to use as a base to capture Nanjing. Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father successfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing. The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on 24 August. Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements -- though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived. Koxinga's forces were defeated and \\"slipped back\\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them. Koxinga, importantly, was mentally unstable, known to have a vicious temper and tendency towards ordering executions. While this might be explained by the trauma of his family being killed by the Qing army and his mother's reported suicide (in order to prevent capture by the Qing), it was also speculated that he suffered from syphilis, a suspicion held by a Dutch doctor, Christian Beyer, who treated him. Vittorio Riccio noted that Koxinga held samurai ideals on bravery, used \\"feigned and hearty laughter\\" to show anger, and adhered to bushido because of his samurai training and his Japanese upbringing. One Spanish missionary proffered a personal opinion that his bad temper and reported propensity for violence was due to Japanese heritage; however, this same missionary's account of the number of Koxinga's executions was greatly exaggerated. Koxinga suffered from \\"depressive insanity\\" and mental illness according to Dr. Li Yengyue. =In Taiwan= Image of Koxinga Temple in Tainan Extent of territory held by Koxinga (red), sphere of influence (pink) In 1661, Koxinga led his troops on a landing at Lakjemuyse to attack the Dutch colonists in Dutch Formosa. Koxinga said to the Dutch \\"Hitherto this island had always belonged to China, and the Dutch had doubtless been permitted to live there, seeing that the Chinese did not require it for themselves; but requiring it now, it was only fair that Dutch strangers, who came from far regions, should give way to the masters of the island.\\" The Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty, and proceeded to work for the Chinese, beheading Dutch people. The frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them, and by destroying their Protestant school textbooks. On 1 February 1662, the Dutch Governor of Formosa, Frederick Coyett, surrendered Fort Zeelandia to Koxinga. According to Frederick Coyett's own self-justifying account written after the siege, Koxinga's life was saved at the end of the siege by a certain Hans Jurgen Radis of Stockaert, a Dutch defector who strongly advised him against visiting the ramparts of the fort after he had taken it, which Radis knew would be blown up by the retreating Dutch forces. This claim of a Dutch defector only appears in Coyett's account and Chinese records make no mention of any defector. In the peace treaty, Koxinga was styled \\"Lord Teibingh Tsiante Teysiancon Koxin\\" (Â§ßÊòéÊãõË®éÂ§ßÂ∞áËªçÂúãÂßì). This effectively ended 38 years of Dutch rule on Taiwan. Koxinga then devoted himself to transforming Taiwan into a military base for loyalists who wanted to restore the Ming dynasty. Koxinga formulated a plan to give oxen and farming tools and teach farming techniques to the Taiwan Aboriginals, giving them Ming gowns and caps, and gifting tobacco to Aboriginals who were gathering in crowds to meet and welcome him as he visited their villages after he defeated the Dutch. =In the Philippines= In 1662, Koxinga's forces raided several towns in the Philippines. Koxinga's chief adviser was an Italian friar named Vittorio Riccio, whom he sent to Manila to demand tribute from the colonial government of the Spanish East Indies, threatening to attack the city if his demands were not met. The Spanish refused to pay the tribute and reinforced the garrisons around Manila, but the planned attack never took place due to Koxinga's sudden death in that year after expelling the Dutch from Taiwan. Koxinga's threat to invade the islands and expel the Spanish was an important factor in the Spanish failure to conquer the Muslim Moro people in Mindanao. The threat of Chinese invasion forced the Spanish to withdraw their forces to Manila, leaving some troops in Jolo and by Lake Lanao to engage the Moro in protracted conflict, while their fort on Zamboanga in Mindanao was immediately evacuated following Koxinga's threats. The Spanish were also forced to permanently abandon their colony in the Maluku Islands (Moluccas) and withdraw their soldiers from there to Manila. Tonio Andrade judged that Koxinga would most likely have been able to defeat the Spanish if the threatened invasion had taken place. =Death= Koxinga died of malaria in June 1662, only a few months after defeating the Dutch in Taiwan, at the age of 37. There were speculations that he died in a sudden fit of madness when his officers refused to carry out his orders to execute his son Zheng Jing. Zheng Jing had had an affair with his wet nurse and conceived a child with her. Zheng Jing succeeded his father as the King of Tungning. As he descended into death, Koxinga relented and agreed to let his son Zheng Jing succeed him. Koxinga died as he passed into delirium and madness and expressed his regrets to his family and father. Family A portrait of Zheng Chenggong painted by Huang Zi ÈªÉÊ¢ì Zheng Chenggong‚Äôs short but eventful career was characterised by family tension and conflicting loyalties. The title of Koxinga (\\"Lord of the Imperial Surname\\") was one that Zheng himself used during his lifetime to emphasize his status as an adopted son of the deposed imperial house, so it was also a declaration of ongoing support to the Ming dynasty. Despite his deliberate self-identification as the noble, loyal vassal of a vanquished master, Koxinga‚Äôs actual relationship with the Longwu Emperor lasted only twelve months or so, beginning in September 1645 and ending with the Emperor's death the following year. Although many secondary sources claim that the two men shared a \\"close bond of affection\\", there is an absence of any reliable contemporary evidence on Koxinga‚Äôs relationship with the Longwu Emperor. In contrast, Koxinga's father Zheng Zhilong left his Japanese wife not long after the birth of his son; Koxinga was a boy of seven when he finally joined his father on the Fujianese coast. It seems that Zheng Zhilong recognised his son‚Äôs talent and encouraged him in his studies and the pursuit of a career as a scholar-official, which would legitimise the power the Zheng family had acquired, using sometimes questionable means. Zheng Zhilong‚Äôs defection to the Qing must have seemed opportunistic and in stark contrast to Koxinga‚Äôs continued loyalty to the Ming. But it is difficult to deny that in refusing to submit to the Qing, Koxinga was risking the life of his father, and that the subsequent death of Zheng Zhilong could only be justified by claiming loyalty to the Ming. It has even been suggested that Koxinga‚Äôs fury at the incestuous relationship between his son, Zheng Jing, and a younger son‚Äôs wet nurse was due to the fact that strict Confucian morality had played such a crucial role in justifying his lack of filial behaviour. The one possible exception to this may have been his relationship with his mother, which has generally been described as being extremely affectionate, particularly in Chinese and Japanese sources. Their time together, however, was apparently very short ‚Äì despite frequent entreaties from Zheng Zhilong for her to join him in China, Koxinga‚Äôs mother was only reunited with her son some time in 1645, and a year later she was killed when the Qing took Xiamen. A portrait of Zheng was in the hands of Yuchun who was his descendant in the eight generation. Koxinga's descendants live in both mainland China and Taiwan and descendants of his brother Shichizaemon live in Japan. His descendants through his grandson Zheng Keshuang served as Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian. They still live there to this day. His descendants through one of his sons Zheng Kuan live in Taiwan. One of Koxinga's descendants on mainland China, Zheng Xiaoxuan ÈÑ≠ÊõâÂµê the father of Zheng Chouyu (()) fought against the Japanese invaders in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Zheng Chouyu was born in Shandong in mainland China and called himself a \\"child of the resistance\\" against Japan and he became a refugee during the war, moving from place to place across China to avoid the Japanese. He moved to Taiwan in 1949 and focuses his work on building stronger ties between Taiwan and mainland China. Zheng Chouyu was born in mainland China, he identified as Chinese and he felt alienated after he was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949 which was previously under Japanese rule and felt strange and foreign to him. He is Koxinga's 11th generation descendant and his original name is Zheng Wenji. \\"Koxinga: Chronicles of the Tei Family\\" was written by R. A. B. Posonby-Fane. =Concubine= During the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, Koxinga executed Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek and took his teenage daughter as a concubine.(Volume 2 of A History of Christianity in Asia, Samuel H. Moffett Volume 36 of American Society of Missiology series) Other Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their wives. In 1684 some of these Dutch wives were still captives of the Chinese. Modern-day legacy and influences Statue of Koxinga in Fort Zeelandia, Anping, Tainan, Taiwan It is debated whether he was clean-shaven or wore a beard. Koxinga's legacy is treated similarly on each side of the Taiwan Strait. Koxinga is worshiped as a god in coastal China, especially Fujian, by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and in Taiwan. There is a temple dedicated to Koxinga and his mother in Tainan City, Taiwan. The National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, one of the most prestigious universities in Taiwan, is named after him. Koxinga's army also brought the Qinxi fraternal brotherhood into Taiwan, of which some of his army were members of the organization. In the present day, the Qinxi currently exists in Taiwan. The Hongmen are associated with them. Tokugawa Japan imported books from Qing China including works on the Zheng family. The Qing built a shrine to commemorate Koxinga to counteract the Japanese and French in Taiwan in the 19th century. Zheng Juzhong's books Zheng Chenggong zhuan was imported to Japan and reprinted in 1771. The play The Battles of Coxinga was written by Chikamatsu Monzaemon in Japan in the 18th century, first performed in Kyoto. A 2001 film titled The Sino-Dutch War 1661 starred Vincent Zhao as Koxinga. The film was renamed Kokusenya Kassen after the aforementioned play and released in Japan in 2002. Koxinga has received renewed attention since rumors began circulating that the People‚Äôs Liberation Army Navy were planning to name their newly acquired aircraft carrier, the ex- Soviet Varyag, the \\"Shi Lang\\". Admiral Shi Lang famously defeated Koxinga‚Äôs descendants in the 1683 Battle of Penghu, thus bringing Taiwan under Qing rule. However, the Chinese government denied all allegations that the vessel would be dedicated to the decorated Qing dynasty admiral. Koxinga is regarded as a hero in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and Japan, but historical narratives regarding Koxinga frequently differ in explaining his motives and affiliation. Japan treats him as a native son and emphasized his maternal link to Japan in propaganda during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. The People's Republic of China considers Koxinga a national hero for driving the imperialist Dutch away from Taiwan and establishing ethnic Chinese rule over the island. On mainland China, Koxinga is honoured as the \\"Conqueror of Taiwan, Great Rebel-Quelling General\\" a military hero who brought Taiwan back within the Han Chinese sphere of influence through expanded economic, trade and cultural exchanges. In China, Koxinga is honoured without the religious overtones found in Taiwan. The Republic of China, which withdrew to Taiwan after losing the Chinese Civil War, regards Koxinga as a patriot who also retreated to Taiwan and used it as a base to launch counterattacks against the Qing dynasty of mainland China. In Taiwan, Koxinga is honored as the island‚Äôs most respected saint for expelling the Dutch and seen as the original ancestor of a free Taiwan, and is known as Kaishan Shengwang, or \\"the Sage King who Opened up Taiwan\\" and as \\"The Yanping Prince\\", referring to the Kingdom of Tungning, which he established in modern-day Tainan. In Taiwan, Koxinga is remembered and revered as a divine national hero with hundreds of temples, schools, tertiary educations, and other public centers named in his honor. Koxinga is accredited with replacing Dutch colonial rule with a more modern political system. Furthermore, Koxinga transformed Taiwan into an agrarian society through the introduction of new agricultural methods such as the proliferation of iron farming tools and new farming methods with cattle. For these reasons, Koxinga is often associated with \\"hints of [a] consciousness of Taiwanese independence\\". Although Koxinga himself wanted Taiwan unified with the rest of China. Great care was taken to symbolise support for the Ming legitimacy, an example being the use of the term guan instead of bu to name departments, since the latter is reserved for central government, whereas Taiwan was to be a regional office of the rightful Ming rule of China. However, not all Taiwanese accept the popularized interpretation of the Koxinga legacy. Supporters of Taiwanese independence are skeptical about embracing the Koxinga legacy. Koxinga's mixed Japanese heritage (the Japanese were an occupying force for 50 years between 1895 and 1945) and the positive connotations in mainland China have all made acceptance by Taiwan independence supporters problematic. In mainland China, Koxinga is considered a positive historical but human figure (not deified as he often is in Taiwan). Koxinga‚Äôs retreat to Taiwan is seen largely as an inspirational story of Chinese nationalists seeking refuge against hostile forces. Koxinga's aspirations to see Taiwan united with the mainland is often accentuated. Furthermore, Koxinga facilitated the settlement of a large number of Han Chinese to Taiwan who brought with them their Han cultures, traditions, and languages. As a direct result, Han Chinese make up approximately 98% of the Taiwanese population today. The historical novel Lord of Formosa by Dutch author Joyce Bergvelt uses Koxinga as the main character. Memorial institutions There are hundreds of public pieces, shrines dedicated to and worship Koxinga. The Koxinga Temple in Tainan City, Taiwan, is perhaps the most interesting as it is \\"the only Fujianese style shrine in Taiwan\\". The temple \\"illustrat[es] the geographic connection between Taiwan and the Mainland, [whilst] describ[ing] the evolution of life from the past to the present\\", which means that the temple acknowledges that Koxinga is a legacy shared by both Taiwan and the Mainland and that this perhaps is still important today. In Mainland China however, there is only one official memorial to their \\"conqueror of Taiwan\\" and that is on Gulang Island of Xiamen, Fujian Province, which is positioned directly across Taiwan's Kinmen. The imposing statue of Zheng Chenggong in full military regalia, gazes over the water facing Taiwan. (Not to be confused with the 9 meter tall Zheng Chenggong statue that is on a pedestrian-only island in the Jiankong islet in Jincheng Township, Kinmen County, Taiwan). Whilst \\"the statue of Zheng portrays a clean-shaven young general in armour ... [in] Taiwan, Koxinga seldom appears as a warrior. His portraits show him as a Ming noble in civilian robes ‚Äì and wearing a small beard, a symbol of seniority and sobriety\\". This difference in commemoration of the Koxinga story illustrates the wide difference in attitudes on either side of the Taiwan Strait on the issue of Taiwan sovereignty. *National Cheng Kung University (Koxinga University) *Cheng Kung Senior High School *Cheng Kung class frigate *Chenggong, Taitung See also *Anti-Qing sentiment *Great Clearance (1661‚Äì1669) *History of Taiwan *Kingdom of Tungning *Koxinga Ancestral Shrine References =Citations= =Bibliography=   *Meij, Philip.

The samaj was founded by Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati on 10 April 1875.Hastings J. and Selbi J. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Kessinger 2003 part 3. p. 57. Members of the Arya Samaj believe in one God and reject the worship of idols. Arya Samaj was the first Hindu organization to introduce proselytization in Hinduism. Foundation The Arya Samaj was established in Bombay on 10 April 1875 by Dayananda Saraswati (born \\"Mool Shankar\\" in Kathiawar, Gujarat 1824 died Ajmer, 1883)E News Aryasamaj website 2 March 2010. Accessed 3 February 2017 An alternative date for the foundation of the samaj is 24 June 1877 because it was then, in Lahore when the samaj became more than just a regional movement based in Punjab.Dayanand Saraswati Himalaya publishing documents. =Vedic schools= Between 1869 and 1873, Dayanand began his efforts to reform orthodox Hinduism in India. He established Gurukul (Vedic schools) which emphasised Vedic values, culture, Satya (virtue) and Sanatana Dharma (the essence of living). The schools gave separate educations to boys and girls based on ancient Vedic principles. The Vedic school system was also to relieve Indians from the pattern of a British education.Sharma R. N and Sharma R. K. Problems of Education in India Atlantic 2006 p. 356 The first Vedic school was established at Farrukhabad in 1869.Saxena G. S. Arya Samaj movement in India, 1875‚Äì1947 Commonwealth publishers 1990 p. 47 Fifty students were enrolled in its first year. This success led to the founding of schools at Mirzapur (1870), Kasganj (1870), Chhalesar (Aligarh) (1870) and Varanasi (1873). At the schools, students received all meals, lodging, clothing and books free of charge. The discipline was strict. Students were not allowed to perform murti puja (worship of sculpted stone idols). Rather, they performed Sandhyavandanam (meditative prayer using Vedic mantras with divine sound) and agnihotra (making heated milk offering twice daily). The study of Sanskrit scriptural texts which accepted the authority of the Vedas were taught. They included the Vedas, Upanishads, Aranyaka, Kashika, Nirukta, Mahabhasya, Ashtadhyayi, Darshanas. =\\"The Light of Truth\\" lecture series= After visiting Calcutta, Dayanand's work changed. He began lecturing in Hindi rather than in Sanskrit. Although Sanskrit garnered respect, in Hindi, Dayanand reached a much larger audience. His ideas of reform began to reach the poorest people. In Varanasi, after hearing Dayanand speak, a local government official called Jaikishen Das encouraged Dayanand to publish a book about his ideas. From June to September 1874, Dayanand dictated a series of lectures to his scribe, Bhimsen Sharma. The lectures recorded Dayanand's views on a wide range of subjects. They have published in 1875 in Varanasi with the title Satyarth Prakash (\\"the light of truth\\"). =New Samaj= While his manuscript for Satyarth Prakash was being edited in Varanasi, Dayanand received an invitation to travel to Bombay. There, he was to debate representatives of the Vallabhacharya sect. On 20 October 1874, Dayanand arrived in Bombay. The debate, though well publicized, never took place. Nonetheless, two members of the Prarthana Samaj approached Dayanand and invited him to speak at one of their gatherings. He did so and was well received. They recognized Dayanand's desire to uplift the Hindu community and protect Hindus from the pressures to convert to Christianity or Islam. Dayanand spent over one month in Bombay and attracted sixty people to his cause. They proposed founding a new samaj with Dayanand's ideas as its spiritual and intellectual basis. =Rajkot Arya Samaj= On 31 December 1874, Dayanand arrived in Rajkot, Gujarat, on the invitation of Hargovind Das Dvarkadas, the secretary of the local Prarthana Samaj. He invited topics of discourse from the audience and spoke on eight. Again, Dayanand was well received and the Rajkot group elected to join his cause. The Samaj was renamed Arya Samaj (Society of Nobles). Dayanand published a list of twenty-eight rules and regulations for the followers. After leaving Rajkot, Dayanand went to Ahmedabad but his audience at a meeting on 27 January 1875, did not elect to form a new Arya Samaj. Meanwhile, the Rajkot group had become in a political row. =Bombay Arya Samaj= A meeting of the Arya SamƒÅj for investing boys with the sacred threadRussell R. V. The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India 1916 vol. 1 On his return to Bombay, Dayanand began a membership drive for a local Arya samaj and received one hundred enrollees. On 7 April 1875,Bombay Arya Samaj was established. Dayanand himself enrolled as a member rather than the leader of the Bombay group. The Samaj began to grow. After Dayanand Dayanand was assassinated in 1883. The Arya Samaj continued to grow, especially in Punjab. The early leaders of the Samaj were Pandit Lekh Ram (1858 1897) and Swami Shraddhanand (Mahatma Munshi Ram Vij) (1856 1926). Some authors claim that the activities of the Samaj led to increased antagonism between Muslims and Hindus. Shraddhanand led the Shuddhi movement that aimed to bring Hindus who had converted to other religions back to Hinduism.Nair N. Changing Homelands: Hindu Politics and the Partition of India. Permanent Black, New Delhi 2011. p. 53 In 1893, the Arya Samaj members of Punjab were divided on the question of vegetarianism. The group that refrained from eating meat were called the \\"Mahatma\\" group and the other group, the \\"Cultured Party\\".\\"Punjab\\" Imperial Gazetteer of India 1909. vol. 20 p. 291. Accessed 2 October 2014. In the early 1900s, the Samaj (or organizations inspired by it such as Jat Pat Todak Mandal) campaigned against caste discrimination.Rajivlochan M. Coping with Exclusions the Non-Political Way in Judge P. S. Mapping Social Exclusion in India: Caste, Religion and Borderlands Cambridge University Press 2014 p. 82 83. They also campaigned for widow remarriage and women's education. The samaj also established chapters in British colonies having Indian population such as South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, Suriname, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.Vertovec S. The Hindu Diaspora: Comparative Patterns Routledge, London 2000. pp. 29, 54 and 69. .

The British colonial government in the early part of 20th century viewed the Samaj as a political body. Some Samajis in government service were dismissed for belonging to the Samaj In the 1930s, when the Hindu Nationalist group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh grew in prominence in Northern India, they found support from the Arya Samaj of Punjab.Jaffrelot C. The Hindu Nationalist Movement and Indian Politics: 1925 to the 1990s. Penguin Books, New Delhi 1999. pp. 67 and 68. . =Arya Samaj in Punjab= In Punjab, the Arya Samaj was opposed by the Ahmadiyya movement which provided the Samaj one of its most aggressive opponents from among the various Muslim groups and whose founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was extensively involved in theological disputations with Samaj leaders, most notably with Pandit Lekh Ram. It was also opposed by the Sikh dominated Singh Sabha, the forerunner of the Akali Dal. =Arya Samaj in Sindh= The Samaj was active in Sindh at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. The activities of the samaj in the region included using shuddhi in integrating half-Muslim or low-caste communities into the organization. Narayan Dev, a samaj member active in making many conversions is extolled as a Sindhi martyr. He is sometimes referred to as 'Dayanand ka vir sipahi' (Dayanand's 's heroic soldier).Dev was killed in a street fight in 1948. The history of Sindhi nationalism is also tied with the activities of the Arya Samaj. In the 19th century, the Hindu community of Sindh had been challenged by Christian missionaries and the Samaj served as a deterrent to the ‚Äúconversion‚Äù done by Christian missionaries in the region. A Hindu Sindhi leader, K R Malkani, later on became prominent in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the BJP.According to Malkani, the Arya Samaj created a ‚Äúnew pride‚Äù among the Hindu Sindhis by opening gymnasia and Sanskrit pathshalas in the 1930s.Dhabhai, G., 2018. The Purusharthi Refugee. Economic & Political Weekly, 53(4), p.67. =Arya Samaj in Gujarat= The Arya Samaj of Gujarat members were missionaries from Punjab who had been encouraged to move to Gujarat to carry out educational work amongst the untouchable castes by the maharaja, Sayajirao Gaekwad III. The Gujarat Samaj opened orphanages. In 1915, the samaj lost its following to Mahatma Gandhi.Hardiman D. Purifying the nation, the Arya Samaj in Gujarat 1895‚Äì1930 Indian Economic and Social History Review 2000. 44:1 p. 41 65. =Reconversion in Malabar= In 1921, during a rebellion by the Muslim Moplah community of Malabar Indian newspapers reported that a number of Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. The Arya Samaj extended its efforts to the region to reconvert these people back to Hinduism through Shuddhi ceremonies.Thursby G. R.

He also criticized the samaj efforts at converting Christians and Muslims. =Arya Samaj in Hyderabad state= A branch of Arya Samaj was established at Dharur in Beed district of Hyderabad state, the largest princely state during British colonial rule. Keshav Rao Koratkar was the president of the organization until 1932. During his tenure, the Samaj, established schools and libraries throughout the state. Although a social and religious organization, the Samaj activities assumed a great political role in resisting the government of the Nizam during 1930s. In 1938-1939, Arya Samaj teamed up with the Hindu Mahasabha to resist the Nizam government through Satyagraha. The Nizam government responded by raiding and desecrating Arya samaj mandirs. The Samaj, in turn, criticized Islam and the Islamic rulers of the state. This widely increased the gulf between the Hindu and Muslim population of the state. =Language issue= Arya Samaj promoted the use of Hindi in Punjab and discouraged the use of Punjabi. This was a serious point of difference between the Sikhs, represented by the Shiromani Akali Dal group and the Arya Samaj. The difference was marked during the period immediately following the independence of India and the time of the Punjabi Suba movement (demand for a Punjabi speaking state).Lamba K. G.

For example, donations were made to victims of the 1905 Kangra earthquake. The samaj campaigned for women's right to vote, and for the protection of widows.Sharma S. C. Punjab, the Crucial Decade Atlantic 1987. p. 133. Contemporary Arya Samaj =Arya Samaj in India= Arya Samaj schools and temples are found in almost all major cities and as well as in rural areas (especially in the North region) of India. Some are authorised to conduct weddings. The Samaj is associated with the Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) schools which number over eight hundred.Arya Samaj Arya Samaj website. There are eight million followers of the samaj in India. The former Indian prime minister Charan Singh, as a young man, was a member of Arya Samaj in Ghaziabad.

Core beliefs O3m (Aum), considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God. Members of the Arya Samaj believe in one almighty creator referred to with the syllable Aum as mentioned in the Yajur Veda (40:17). They believe the Vedas is an infallible authority and they also respect the Upanishads and Vedic philosophy as the Vedas because darshan and upnishad are created by vedic rishi. The Arya Samaj members reject other Hindu religious texts which made by normal pandit because they are not \\"revealed\\" works and these texts promote things without logic and against the Vedas . For instance, they believe books like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are legends of historical figures, and rejects them as reference to supreme beings and avatars. The members of Arya Samaj reject other scriptural works such as the Puranas, the Bible, and the Quran. They reject the worship of idols. The Arya Samaj promotes the equality of all human beings and the empowerment of women. The core beliefs of Arya Samaj are postulated below: # The primeval cause of all genuine knowledge and all that is known by means of knowledge is God. # God is Truth-consciousness ‚Äì Bliss personified, Formless, Omnipotent, Just, Merciful, Unborn, Infinite, Unchangeable, Beginningless, Incomparable, Support of all, Lord of all, Omnipresent, Internal, the regulator of all, Undecaying, Immortal, Fearless, Eternal, Holy, and creator of the Universe. He alone deserves worship. # The Vedas are repositories of all of true knowledge. It is the paramount duty of all Aryas to study and teach and to propound the Veda. # We should be ever ready to imbibe truth and forsake untruth. # All acts should be done in accordance with Dharma, i.e. after deliberating upon what is truth and untruth. # The prime object of Arya Samaj is to do good to the whole world, i.e. to achieve physical, spiritual and social prosperity for all. # Our conduct towards all should be guided by love, by injunctions of Dharma and according to their respective positions. # One should dispel ignorance and promote knowledge. # One should not be content with one's own prosperity only, but should consider the prosperity of all as his own prosperity. # All human beings should abide by the rules concerning social or everyone's benefit, while everyone should be free to follow any rule beneficial for him/her. Practices Agnihotra by Arya Samaj The Arya Samaj members consider the Gayatri Mantra,Naidoo T. The Arya Samaj movement in South Africa Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi 1992 first edition. p.30 and 71. as the most holy mantra and chant it periodically, do the meditation known as \\"Sandhya\\" and make offering to the holy fire (havan). The havan can be performed with a priest for special occasions or without a priest for personal worship. The havan is performed as per the , usually a simplified guide to do havan, having mantras for general or special occasions. The priest is generally a Vedic scholar from the local Arya Samaj Mandir or Gurukul. Sometimes elder members of family or neighbours can also perform the havan acting as a purohit. The host is known as the \\"Yajmana\\". The priest can be called an \\"Acharya\\", \\"Swami ji\\" or \\"Pandit Ji\\" depending upon his scholarly status and local reputation. It is customary to give a nominal \\"dakshina\\" to the priest after havan, although in Arya Samaj it is more symbolic and the priest does not state any sum. The sum is decided by the host's capability and status but is still a small amount. Members celebrate Holi (the start of spring) and Diwali (a harvest festival and the victory of good over evil). Arya Samaj advocates a lacto-vegetarian diet and in particular, the eating of beef is strictly prohibited. After a death, Arya Samajis will often conduct a haven and collect the ashes on the fourth day.Firth S. Dying, death and bereavement in a British Hindu community Peeters, Leuven 1997. p. 89. =Diwali= Diya with one wick. Diya with four wicks, pointing in each direction (N, W, S, E). The Arya Samaj version of the Hindu festival Diwali is typified by the celebration in Suriname. The festival celebrates the victory of good over evil. A vegetarian fast is kept. The Gayatri Mantra is recited while oil lamps are lit, in front of a fire altar lit with sandalwood. One Diya lamp, which is of larger size has two wicks crossed to produce four lights, one in each direction and is lit first. The smaller lamp has one wick. A lamp is kept in every room except the bathroom and restroom. More lamps can be lit, which can be placed arbitrarily in the yard, living room and so on.Arya Dharm: Hindu Consciousness in 19th-Century Punjab Paperback ‚Äì January 1, 2006 =Holi= Holi is celebrated as the conclusion of winter and the start of spring to sow the land and hope for a good harvest. This day is marked by colors and songs (Chautal). It does not require specific prayer or fasting, however, some people keep a vegetarian fast on this day. The Arya Samaj does not associate Holi with a particular deity such as Vishnu or Shiva and in comparison to some interpretations of the festival, the Arya Samaj version in more sober and is as per the 4 Vedas.Jones K.

His theatre work included notable performances in productions of the plays of Shakespeare and Shaw, and his film work included leading roles in a number of adapted literary classics. Early life Hardwicke was born in Lye, West Midlands to Edwin Webster Hardwicke and his wife, Jessie (n√©e Masterson). He attended Bridgnorth Grammar School in Shropshire. He intended to train as a doctor but failed to pass the necessary examinations.\\"Hardwicke, Sir Cedric Webster\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2012; accessed 20 March 2013 He turned to the theatre and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).Parker, pp. 714‚Äì15 =Military service= Hardwicke enlisted at the outbreak of the First World War. He served from 1914 to 1921 as an officer in the Judge Advocate's branch of the British Army in France. He was one of the last members of the British Expeditionary Force to leave France. Career =Stage= The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse Hardwicke made his first appearance on stage at the Lyceum Theatre, London in 1912 during the run of Frederick Melville's melodrama The Monk and the Woman, when he took over the part of Brother John. During this year, he was at Her Majesty's Theatre understudying, and subsequently appeared at the Garrick Theatre in Charles Klein's play Find the Woman, and Trust the People. In 1913, he joined Benson's Company and toured in the provinces, South Africa, and Rhodesia. During 1914 he toured with Miss Darragh (Letitia Marion Dallas, d. 1917) in Laurence Irving's play The Unwritten Law, and he appeared at the Old Vic in 1914 as Malcolm in Macbeth, Tranio in The Taming of the Shrew, the gravedigger in Hamlet, and other roles. After his service in the British Army in WWI, he resumed his acting career. In January 1922 he joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, playing a range of parts from the drooping young lover Faulkland in The Rivals to the roistering Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night. He played many classical roles on stage, appearing at London's top theatres, making his name on the stage performing works by George Bernard Shaw, who said that Hardwicke was his fifth favourite actor after the four Marx Brothers. As one of the leading Shavian actors of his generation, Hardwicke starred in Caesar and Cleopatra, Pygmalion, The Apple Cart, Candida, Too True to Be Good, and Don Juan in Hell, making such an impression that at the age of 41 he became the youngest actor to be knighted (this occurred in the 1934 New Year's Honours; Laurence Olivier subsequently took the record in 1947 when he was knighted at the age of 40). Other stage successes included The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse, Antigone and A Majority of One, winning a Tony Award nomination for his performance as a Japanese diplomat. In 1928, whilst appearing with Edith Day, Paul Robeson and Alberta Hunter in the London production of Showboat, he married actress Helena Pickard. In December 1935, Hardwicke was elected Rede Lecturer to Cambridge University for 1936, he took as his subject \\"The Drama Tomorrow\\".W. A. Darlington, W. A. profile, rev. K.D. Reynolds, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 20 March 2013 In the late 1930s, he moved to the U.S., initially for film work. In the early 1940s, he continued his stage career on tours and in New York. In 1944, Hardwicke returned to Britain, again touring, and reappeared on the London stage, at the Westminster Theatre, on 29 March 1945, as Richard Varwell in a revival of Eden and Adelaide Phillpotts' comedy Yellow Sands, and subsequently toured in this on the continent. He returned to America late in 1945 and appeared with Ethel Barrymore in December in a revival of Shaw's Pygmalion, and continued on the New York stage the following year. In 1946, he starred opposite Katharine Cornell as King Creon in her production of Jean Anouilh's adaptation of the Greek tragedy Antigone.Mosel, \\"Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell\\" In 1948, he joined the Old Vic Company at the New Theatre to play Sir Toby Belch, Doctor Faustus, and Gaev in The Cherry Orchard, but according to critic and biographer W.A. Darlington, \\"it was about this time that he confessed to a friend that he was finding the competition in London too hot for him\\", and he moved permanently to the U.S. In 1951‚Äì52, he appeared on Broadway in Shaw's Don Juan in Hell with Agnes Moorehead, Charles Boyer and Charles Laughton. =Film and television work= Hardwicke's first appearance in a British film was in 1931, and from the late 1930s, he was in great demand in Hollywood. He played David Livingstone opposite Spencer Tracy's Henry Morton Stanley in Stanley and Livingstone in 1939, and also played the evil Jean Frollo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame the same year. In 1940, he played Mr Jones in a screen version of Joseph Conrad's novel Victory. He starred as the unfortunate Ludwig von Frankenstein in The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), alongside Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi. The Ten Commandments (1956) Hardwicke played in films such as Les Mis√©rables (1935), King Solomon's Mines (1937), The Keys of the Kingdom (1944), The Winslow Boy (1948), Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948), and Olivier's Richard III (1955). He was featured as King Arthur in the comedy/musical A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1949), singing Busy Doing Nothing in a trio with Bing Crosby and William Bendix, and as the Pharaoh Sethi in Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 film The Ten Commandments. He appeared in a 1956 episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents titled Wet Saturday in which he portrayed Mr. Princey, an aristocratic gentleman who tries to cover up a murder to avoid public scandal. On 6 March 1958, he guest-starred on the TV series The Ford Show, starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. During the 1961‚Äì62 television season, Hardwicke starred as Professor Crayton in Gertrude Berg's sitcom Mrs. G. Goes to College, which ran for 26 weeks on CBS. The story line had Berg attending college as a 62-year-old widowed freshman studying under Hardwicke, with whom she previously had acted. Earlier, Hardwicke guest-starred on the Howard Duff and Ida Lupino sitcom Mr. Adams and Eve. He starred in The Twilight Zone episode Uncle Simon that first aired 15 November 1963. His final acting role was in The Outer Limits in the episode \\"The Forms of Things Unknown\\". =Radio= In 1945, Hardwicke played Sherlock Holmes in a BBC Radio dramatisation of The Speckled Band, opposite Finlay Currie as Dr. Watson. Years later, Hardwicke's son Edward played Watson in the acclaimed Granada series. Hardwicke played the title role in a short-lived revival of the Bulldog Drummond radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System. It ran 3 January 1954 to 28 March 1954. Personal In 1928, he married the English actress Helena Pickard. They divorced in 1948; their son was actor Edward Hardwicke. His second marriage, which produced a son, Michael, and likewise ended in divorce, was to Mary Scott (1921‚Äì2009), from 1950 to 1961. Death A lifelong heavy smoker, he suffered from emphysema and died 6 August 1964 at the age of 71 in New York from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Hardwicke's body was flown back to England; after a memorial service he was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in north London, where his ashes were scattered. Legacy Hardwicke left two volumes of memoirs: Let's Pretend: Recollections and Reflections of a Lucky Actor, 1932 and A Victorian in Orbit: as told to James Brough, 1962. He is commemorated by a sculpture by Tim Tolkien at Lye, commissioned by the Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council. The memorial takes the form of a giant filmstrip, the illuminated cut metal panels illustrating scenes from some of Hardwicke's better-known roles, which include The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Things to Come, and The Ghost of Frankenstein. Unveiled in November 2005, it is located at Lye Cross where he lived as a child. Thorns School and Community College in neighbouring Quarry Bank has renamed its drama theatre in his honour as the Hardwicke Theatre. Hardwicke has a motion pictures star and a television star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Filmography * Nelson (1926) as Horatio Nelson (film debut) * Dreyfus (1931) as Capt.

One of the first truly innovative television systems to enter the market since the 1950s, the Trinitron was announced in 1968 to wide acclaim for its bright images, about 25% brighter than common shadow mask televisions of the same era. Constant improvement in the basic technology and attention to overall quality allowed Sony to charge a premium for Trinitron devices into the 1990s. Patent protection on the basic Trinitron design ran out in 1996, and it quickly faced a number of competitors at much lower prices. Sony responded by introducing their flat-screen FD Trinitron designs (WEGA), which maintained their premier position in the market into the early 2000s. However, these designs were surpassed relatively quickly by plasma and LCD designs. Sony removed the last Trinitron televisions from their product catalogs in 2006, and ceased production in early 2008. Video monitors are the only remaining Trinitron products being produced by Sony, at a low production rate, although the basic technology can still be found in downmarket televisions from third parties. The name Trinitron was derived from trinity, meaning the union of three, and tron from electron tube, after the way that the Trinitron combined the three separate electron guns of other CRT designs into one. Close-up of phosphor bars on a 14\\" Sony Trinitron television History =Color television= A 1970s tabletop size Trinitron Color television had been studied, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or \\"gel\\") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used. In spite of these problems, the United States Federal Communication Commission selected a sequential-frame 144 frame/s standard from CBS as their color broadcast in 1950.Ed Reitan, \\"CBS Field Sequential Color System\\" , 24 August 1997 RCA worked along different lines entirely, using the luminance- chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the \\"luminance\\". Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on existing televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a composite video signal - on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the signal would be extracted, decoded back into RGB, and displayed. Although RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the compatible color encoding scheme originally developed by Georges Valensi in 1938, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era, and RCA's early experiments used three-tube projectors, or mirror- based systems known as \\"Triniscope\\".Ed Reitan, \\"RCA Dot Sequential Color System\\" , 28 August 1997 =Shadow masks= RCA eventually solved the problem of displaying the color images with their introduction of the shadow mask. The shadow mask consists of a thin sheet of steel with tiny holes photo etched into it, placed just behind the front surface of the picture tube. Three guns, arranged in a triangle, were all aimed at the holes. Stray electrons at the edge of the beam were cut off by the mask, creating a sharply focused spot that was small enough to hit a single colored phosphor on the screen. Since each of the guns was aimed at the hole from a slightly different angle, the spots of phosphor on the tube could be separated slightly to prevent overlap. The disadvantage of this approach was that for any given amount of gun power, the shadow mask filtered out the majority of the energy. To ensure there was no overlap of the beam on the screen, the dots had to be separated and covered perhaps 25% of its surface. This led to very dim images, requiring much greater electron beam power in order to provide a useful picture. Moreover, the system was highly dependent on the relative angles of the beams between the three guns, which required constant adjustment by the user to ensure the guns hit the correct colors. In spite of this, the technical superiority of the RCA system was overwhelming compared to the CBS system, and was selected as the new NTSC standard in 1953. The first broadcast using the new standard occurred on New Year's Day in 1954, when NBC broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade. (blog about this article, (archived May 4, 2019) In spite of this early start, only a few years after regularly scheduled television broadcasting had begun, consumer uptake of color televisions was very slow to start. The dim images, constant adjustments and high costs had kept them in a niche of their own. Low consumer acceptance led to a lack of color programming, further reducing the demand for the sets in a supply and demand problem. In the United States in 1960, only 1 color set was sold for every 50 sets sold in total.Sony, pg. 42 =Chromatron= Sony had entered the television market in 1960 with the black and white TV8-301, the first non- projection type all-transistor television. A combination of factors, including its small screen size, limited its sales to niche markets. Sony engineers had been studying the color market, but the situation in Japan was even worse than the U.S.; they accounted for only 300 of the 9 million sets sold that year. But by 1961, dealers were asking the Sony sales department when a color set would be available, and the sales department put pressure on engineering in turn. Masaru Ibuka, Sony's president and co-founder, steadfastly refused to develop a system based on RCA's shadow mask design, which he considered technically deficient. He insisted on developing a unique solution.Sony, pg. 43 In 1961, a Sony delegation was visiting the IEEE trade show in New York City, including Ibuka, Akio Morita (Sony's other co-founder) and Nobutoshi Kihara, who was promoting his new CV-2000 home video tape recorder. This was Kihara's first trip abroad and he spent much of his time wandering the trade floor, where he came across a small booth by the small company Autometric. They were demonstrating a new type of color television based on the Chromatron tube, which used a single electron gun and a vertical grille of electrically charged thin wires instead of a shadow mask. The resulting image was far brighter than anything the RCA design could produce, and lacked the convergence problems that required constant adjustments. He quickly brought Morita and Ibuka to see the design, and Morita was \\"sold\\" on the spot.Sony, pg. 44 210x210px Morita arranged a deal with Paramount Pictures, who was paying for Chromatic Labs' development of the Chromatron, taking over the entire project. In early 1963, Senri Miyaoka was sent to Manhattan to arrange the transfer of the technology to Sony, which would lead to the closing of Chromatic Labs. He was unimpressed with the labs, describing the windowless basement as \\"squalor\\". The American team was only too happy to point out the serious flaws in the Chromatron system, telling Miyaoka that the design was hopeless. By September 1964, a 17-inch prototype had been built in Japan, but mass-production test runs were demonstrating serious problems. Sony engineers were unable to make a version of Chromatron that could be reliably mass- produced. When sets were finally made available in late 1964, they were put on the market at a competitive 198,000 yen (US$550), but cost the company over 400,000 yen (US$1111.11) to produce. Ibuka had bet the company on Chromatron and had already set up a new factory to produce them with the hopes that the production problems would be ironed out and the line would become profitable. After several thousand sets had shipped, the situation was no better, while Panasonic and Toshiba were in the process of introducing sets based on RCA licenses. By 1966, the Chromatron was breaking the company financially.Sony, pg. 45 =Trinitron= The Sony Trinitron logo used from 1992 to the 2000s. In the autumn of 1966, Ibuka finally gave in, and announced he would personally lead a search for a replacement for Chromatron. Susumu Yoshida was sent to the U.S. to look for potential licenses, and was impressed with the improvements that RCA had made in overall brightness by introducing new rare earth phosphors on the screen. He also saw General Electric's \\"Porta-color\\" design, using three guns in a row instead of a triangle, which allowed a greater portion of the screen to be lit. His report was cause for concern in Japan, where it seemed Sony was falling ever-farther behind the U.S. designs. They might be forced to license the shadow mask system if they wanted to remain competitive.Sony, pg. 46 Ibuka was not willing to give up entirely, and had his 30 engineers explore a wide variety of approaches to see if they could come up with their own design. At one point, Yoshida asked Senri Miyaoka if the in-line gun arrangement used by GE could be replaced by a single gun with three cathodes; this would be more difficult to build, but be lower cost in the long run. Miyaoka built a prototype and was astonished by how well it worked, although it had focusing problems. Later that week, on Saturday, Miyaoka was summoned to Ibuka's office while he was attempting to leave work to attend his weekly cello practice. Yoshida had just informed Ibuka about his success, and the two asked Miyaoka if they could really develop the gun into a workable product. Miyaoka, anxious to leave, answered yes, excused himself, and left. The following Monday, Ibuka announced that Sony would be developing a new color television tube, based on Miyaoka's prototype.Sony, pg. 47 By February 1967, the focusing problems had been solved, and because there was a single gun, the focusing was achieved with permanent magnets instead of a coil, and required no manual adjustments after manufacturing. During development, Sony engineer Akio Ohgoshi introduced another modification. GE's system improved on the RCA shadow mask by replacing the small round holes with slightly larger rectangles. Since the guns were in-line, their electrons would land onto three rectangular patches instead of three smaller spots, about doubling the lit area. Ohgoshi proposed removing the mask entirely and replacing it with a series of vertical slots instead, lighting the entire screen. Although this would require the guns to be very carefully aligned with the phosphors on the tube in order to ensure they hit the right colors, with Miyaoka's new tube, this appeared possible. In practice, this proved easy to build but difficult to place in the tube - the fine wires were mechanically weak and tended to move when the tubes were bumped, resulting in shifting colors on the screen. This problem was solved by running several fine tungsten wires across the grille horizontally to keep the vertical wires of the grille in place. The combination of three-in-one electron gun and the replacement of the shadow mask with the aperture grille resulted in a unique and easily patentable product. In spite of Trinitron and Chromatron having no technology in common, the shared single electron gun has led to many erroneous claims that the two are very similar, or the same.\\"Sony Trinitron color television receiver, c 1970\\" is a common publication claiming that Trinitron and Chromatron are the same. =Introduction, early models= Officially introduced by Ibuka in April 1968, the original 12 inch Trinitron had a display quality that easily surpassed any commercial set in terms of brightness, color fidelity, and simplicity of operation. The vertical wires in the aperture grille meant that the tube had to be nearly flat vertically; this gave it a unique cylindrical look.https://stweb.peelschools.org/pcsweb/pc_tut/06crtmon.htm It was also all solid state, with the exception of the picture tube itself, which allowed it to be much more compact and cool running than designs like GE's Porta-color. Some larger models such as the KV-1320UB for the United Kingdom market were initially fitted with 3AT2 valves for the extra high tension (high voltage) circuitry, before being redesigned as solid state in the early 70s. Ibuka ended the press conference by claiming that 10,000 sets would be available by October, well beyond what engineering had told him was possible. Ibuka cajoled Yoshida to take over the effort of bringing the sets into production, and although Yoshida was furious at being put in charge of a task he felt was impossible, he finally accepted the assignment and successfully met the production goal.Sony, pg. 48 The KV-1210 was introduced in limited numbers in Japan in October as promised, and in the U.S. as the KV-1210U the following year. Early color sets intended for the UK market had a PAL decoder that was different from those invented and licensed by Telefunken of Germany, who invented the PAL color system. The decoder inside the UK-sold Sony color Trinitron sets, from the KV-1300UB to the KV-1330UB, had an NTSC decoder adapted for PAL. The decoder used a 64 microsecond delay line to store every other line, but instead of using the delay line to average out the phase of the current line and the previous line, it simply repeated the same line twice. Any phase errors could then be compensated for by using a tint control knob on the front of the set, normally unneeded on a PAL set. =Reception= Trinitron computer monitor kx-14cp1 Reviews of the Trinitron were universally positive, although they all mentioned its high cost. Sony won an Emmy Award for the Trinitron in 1973. On his 84th birthday in 1992, Ibuka claimed the Trinitron was his proudest product. New models quickly followed. Larger sizes at 19\\" and then 27\\" were introduced, as well as smaller, including a 7\\" portable. In the mid-1980s, a new phosphor coating was introduced that was much darker than earlier sets, giving the screens a black color when turned off, as opposed to the earlier light grey. This improved the contrast range of the picture. Early models were generally packaged in silver cases, but with the introduction of the darker screens, Sony also introduced new cases with a dark charcoal color, following a similar change in color taking place in the hi-fi world. This line expanded with 32\\", 35\\" and finally 40\\" units in the 1990s. In 1980, Sony introduced the \\"ProFeel\\" line of prosumer component televisions, consisting of a range of Trinitron monitors that could be connected to standardized tuners. The original lineup consisted of the KX-20xx1 20\\" and KX-27xx1 27\\" monitors (the \\"xx\\" is an identifier, PS for Europe, HF for Japan, etc.) the VTX-100ES tuner and TXT-100G TeleText decoder. They were often used with a set of SS-X1A stereo speakers, which matched the grey boxy styling of the suite.\\"KX-20PS1\\" The concept was to build a market similar to contemporary stereo equipment, where components from different vendors could be mixed to produce a complete system. However, a lack of any major third party components, along with custom connectors between the tuner and monitors, meant that systems mixing fully compatible elements were never effectively realized. They were popular high-end units, however, and found a strong following in production companies where the excellent quality picture made them effective low-cost monitors. A second series of all-black units followed in 1986, the ProFeel Pro, sporting a space-frame around the back of the trapezoidal enclosure that doubled as a carrying handle and holder for the pop-out speakers. These units were paired with the VT-X5R tuner and optionally the APM-X5A speakers.\\"Sony PROFEEL\\" Sony also produced lines of Trinitron professional studio monitors, the PVM (Professional Video Monitor) and BVM (Broadcast Video Monitor) lines. These models were packaged in grey metal cubes with a variety of inputs that accepted practically any analog format. They originally used tubes similar to the ProFeel line, but over time, they gradually increased in resolution until the late 1990s when they offered over 900 lines. When these were cancelled as part of the wider Trinitron shutdown in 2007, professionals forced Sony to re-open two of the lines to produce the 20 and 14 inch models. Among similar products, Sony produced the KV-1311 monitor/TV combination. It accepted NTSC-compatible video from various devices as well as analog broadcast TV. Along with its other functions, it had video and audio inputs and outputs as well as a wideband sound-IF decoded output. Its exterior looks much like the monitor illustrated here, with added TV controls. By this time, Sony was well established as a supplier of reliable equipment; it was preferable to have minimal field failures instead of supporting an extensive service network for the entire United States. Sony started developing the Trinitron for computer monitor use in the late 1970s. Demand was high, so high that there were examples of third party companies removing Trinitron tubes from televisions to use as monitors. In response, Sony started development of the GDM (Graphic Display Monitor) in 1983, which offered high resolution and faster refresh rates. Sony aggressively promoted the GDM and it became a standard on high-end monitors by the late 1980s. Particularly common models include the Apple Inc. 13\\" model that was originally sold with the Macintosh II starting in 1987. Well known users also included Digital Equipment Corporation, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and others. Demand for a lower cost solution led to the CDP series. In May 1988, the high-end 20 inch DDM model (Data Display Monitor) was introduced with a maximum resolution of 2,048 by 2,048, which went on to be used in the FAA's Advanced Automation System air traffic control system. These developments meant that Sony was well placed to introduce high-definition televisions (HDTV). In April 1981, they announced the High Definition Video System (HDVS), a suite of MUSE equipment including cameras, recorders, Trinitron monitors and projection TVs. Sony shipped its 100 millionth Trinitron screen in July 1994, 25 years after it had been introduced. New uses in the computer field and the demand for higher resolution televisions to match the quality of DVD when it was introduced in 1996 led to increased sales, with another 180 million units delivered in the next decade.\\"Sony Pulls Plug on Historic Trinitron TV\\" , IEEE Spectrum Online\\"Sony to stop making old- style cathode ray tube TVs\\", Wall Street Journal MarketWatch', 3 March 2008 =End of Trinitron= Sony KV-32S42, a typical late-model Trinitron television, manufactured in 2001. Sony FD Trinitron flat-screen CRT. Sony's patent on the Trinitron display ran out in 1996, after 20 years. After the expiration of Sony's Trinitron patent, manufacturers like Mitsubishi (whose monitor production is now part of NEC Display Solutions) were free to use the Trinitron design for their own product line without license from Sony although they could not use the Trinitron name. For example, Mitsubishi's are called Diamondtron. To some degree, the name Trinitron became a generic term referring to any similar set. Sony responded with the FD Trinitron, which used computer-controlled feedback systems to ensure sharp focus across a flat screen. Initially introduced on their 27, 32 and 36 inch models in 1998, the new tubes were offered in a variety of resolutions for different uses. The basic WEGA models supported normal 480i signals, but a larger version offered 16:9 aspect ratios. The technology was quickly applied to the entire Trinitron range, from 13 to 36 inch. High resolution versions, Hi-Scan and Super Fine Pitch, were also produced. With the introduction of the FD Trinitron, Sony also introduced a new industrial style, leaving the charcoal colored sets introduced in the 1980s for a new silver styling. Sony was not the only company producing flat screen CRTs. Other companies had already introduced high-end brands with flat-screen tubes, like Panasonic's Tau. Many other companies entered the market quickly, widely copying the new silver styling as well. The FD Trinitron was unable to regain the cachet that the Trinitron brand had previously possessed; in the 2004 Christmas season, they increased sales by 5%, but only at the cost of a 75% plunge in profits after being forced to lower costs to compete in the market. At the same time, the introduction of plasma televisions, and then LCD-based ones, led to the high- end market being increasingly focused on the \\"thin\\" sets. Both of these technologies have well known problems, and for some time Sony explored a wide array of technologies that would improve upon them in the same way the Trinitron did on the shadow mask. Among these experiments were organic light- emitting diodes (OLED) and the field emission display, but in spite of considerable effort, neither of these technologies matured into competitors. Sony also introduced their Plasmatron displays, and later LCD as well, but these had no inherent technical advantages over similar sets from other companies. From 2006, all of Sony's BRAVIA television products are LCD displays, initially based on screens from Samsung, and later Sharp. Sony eventually ended production of the Trinitron in Japan in 2004. In 2006, Sony announced that it would no longer market or sell Trinitrons in the United States or Canada, but it would continue to sell the Trinitron in China, India, and regions of South America using tubes delivered from their Singapore plant. Production in Singapore finally ended in March 2008, only months after ending production of their rear-projection systems. Two lines of the factory were later brought back online to supply the professional market. 280 Million Trinitron tubes were built. At its peak, 20 million were made annually.spectrum.ieee.org, 5 March 2008, \\"Sony Pulls Plug on Historic Trinitron TV\\", retrieved 9 June 2020. Description =Basic concept= The Trinitron design incorporates two unique features: the single-gun three- cathode picture tube, and the vertically aligned aperture grille. The single gun consists of a long-necked tube with a single electrode at its base, flaring out into a horizontally-aligned rectangular shape with three vertically-aligned rectangular cathodes inside. Each cathode is fed the amplified signal from one of the decoded RGB signals. The electrons from the cathodes are all aimed toward a single point at the back of the screen where they hit the aperture grille, a steel sheet with vertical slots cut in it. Due to the slight separation of the cathodes at the back of the tube, the three beams approach the grille at slightly different angles. When they pass through the grille they retain this angle, hitting their individual colored phosphors that are deposited in vertical stripes on the inside of the faceplate. The main purpose of the grille is to ensure that each beam strikes only the phosphor stripes for its color, much as does a shadow mask. However, unlike a shadow mask, there are essentially no obstructions along each entire phosphor stripe. Larger CRTs have a few horizontal stabilizing wires part way between top and bottom, but in practice, they are not noticed. =Advantages= In comparison to early shadow mask designs, the Trinitron grille cuts off much less of the signal coming from the electron guns. RCA tubes built in the 1950s cut off about 85% of the electron beam, while the grille cuts off about 25%. Improvements to the shadow mask designs continually narrowed this difference between the two designs, and by the late 1980s the difference in performance, at least theoretically, was eliminated. Another advantage of the aperture grille was that the distance between the wires remained constant vertically across the screen. In the shadow mask design, the size of the holes in the mask is defined by the required resolution of the phosphor dots on the screen, which was constant. However, the distance from the guns to the holes changed; for dots near the center of the screen, the distance was its shortest, at points in the corners it was at its maximum. To ensure that the guns were focused on the holes, a system known as dynamic convergence had to constantly adjust the focus point as the beam moved across the screen. In the Trinitron design, the problem was greatly simplified, requiring changes only for large screen sizes, and only on a line-by-line basis. For this reason, Trinitron systems are easier to focus than shadow masks, and generally had a sharper image. This was a major selling point of the Trinitron design for much of its history. In the 1990s, new computer-controlled real-time feedback focusing systems eliminated this advantage, as well as leading to the introduction of \\"true flat\\" designs. =Disadvantages= Visible support or damping wires Even small changes in the alignment of the grille over the phosphors can cause the color purity to shift. Since the wires are thin, small bumps can cause the wires to shift alignment if they are not held in place. Monitors using Trinitron technology have one or more thin tungsten wires running horizontally across the grille to prevent this. Screens 15\\" and below have one wire located about two thirds of the way down the screen, while monitors greater than 15\\" have 2 wires at the one-third and two-thirds positions. These wires are less apparent or completely obscured on standard definition sets due to wider scan lines to match the lower resolution of the video being displayed. On computer monitors, where the scan lines are much closer together, the wires are often visible. This is a minor drawback of the Trinitron standard which is not shared by shadow mask CRTs. Aperture grilles are not as mecanically stable as shadow or slot masks; a tap can cause the image to briefly become distorted, even with damping/support wires.https://stweb.peelschools.org/pcsweb/pc_tut/06crtmon.htm Anti-glare coating A polyurethane sheet coated to scatter reflections is affixed to the front of the screen, where it can be damaged.

Wales is primarily represented by the symbol of the red Welsh Dragon, but other national emblems include the leek and the daffodil. Although sharing many customs with the other nations of the United Kingdom, Wales has its own distinct traditions and culture, and from the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \\"land of song\\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. Development of Welsh culture =Historical influences= Wales has been identified as having been inhabited by humans for some 230,000 years, as evidenced by the discovery of a Neanderthal at the Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site in north Wales. After the Roman era of occupation, a number of small kingdoms arose in what is now Wales. These early kingdoms were also influenced by Ireland; but details prior to the 8th century AD are unclear. Kingdoms during that era included Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth. Henry Tudor, descended from the Tudors of Penmynydd, became King Henry VII of England While Rhodri the Great in the 9th century was the first ruler to dominate a large portion of Wales, it was not until 1055 that Gruffydd ap Llywelyn united the individual Welsh kingdoms and began to annex parts of England. Gruffydd was killed, possibly in crossfire by his own men, on 5 August 1063 while Harold Godwinson sought to engage him in battle. This was just over three years before the Norman invasion of England, which led to a drastic change of fortune for Wales. By 1070, the Normans had already seen successes in their invasion of Wales, with Gwent fallen and Deheubarth plundered. The invasion was seemingly complete by 1093. However, the Welsh rebelled against their new overlords the following year, and the Welsh kingdoms were re-established and most of the land retaken from the Normans over the following decades. While Gwynedd grew in strength, Powys was broken up after the death of Llywelyn ap Madog in the 1160s and was never reunited. Llywelyn the Great rose in Gwynedd and had reunited the majority of Wales by his death in 1240. After his death, King Henry III of England intervened to prevent Dafydd ap Llywelyn from inheriting his father's lands outside Gwynedd, leading to war. The claims of his successor, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, conflicted with those of King Edward I of England; this resulted in the conquest of Wales by English forces. The Tudors of Penmynydd grew in power and influence during the 13th to 15th centuries, first owning land in north Wales, but losing it after Maredudd ap Tudur backed the uprising of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1400. Maredudd's son, Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur, anglicised his name to become Owen Tudor, and was the grandfather of Henry Tudor. Henry took the throne of England in 1485, at the end of the Wars of the Roses, when his forces defeated those of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. The House of Tudor continued to reign through several successive monarchs until 1603, when James I (James VI of Scotland) took the throne for the House of Stuart; his great grandmother was Margaret Tudor. =Identity and nationalism= Welsh nationalism () emphasises the distinctiveness of Welsh language, culture, and history, and calls for more self-determination for Wales, which might include more devolved powers for the Welsh Assembly or full independence from the United Kingdom. While a sense of nationhood has existed within Wales for over 1500 years, the idea that Wales should be a modern self-determining state has only been mooted since the mid-18th century. During the 15th century, Owain Glyndwr campaigned with initial success for Wales to be reestablished as a country independent of English control. Symbols National symbols of Wales include the dragon, the daffodil and the leek. Legend states that the leek dates back to the 7th century, when King Cadwaladr of Gwynedd had his soldiers wear the vegetable during battle against Saxons to make it easier to identify them. Though this same story is recounted in the 17th century, but now attributed to Saint David. The earliest certain reference of the leek as a Welsh emblem was when Princess Mary, daughter of Henry VIII, was presented with a leek by the yeoman of the guard on Saint David's Day in 1537. The colours of the leek were used for the uniforms of soldiers under Edward I of England. Cadwaladr is also said to have introduced the Red Dragon standard, although this symbol was most likely introduced to the British Isles by Roman troops who in turn had acquired it from the Dacians. It may also have been a reference to the 6th century Welsh word draig, which meant \\"leader\\". The standard was appropriated by the Normans during the 11th century, and used for the Royal Standard of Scotland. Richard I of England took a red dragon standard with him on the Third Crusade. Both symbols were popular with Tudor kings, with Henry VII of England (Henry Tudor) adding the white and green background to the red dragon standard. It was largely forgotten by the House of Stuart, who favoured a unicorn instead. By the 17th and 18th centuries, it became common practice in Great Britain for the gentry to wear leeks on St. David's Day. In 1807, a \\"a red dragon passant standing on a mound\\" was made the King's badge for Wales. Following an increase in nationalism in 1953, it was proposed to add the motto Y ddraig goch ddyry cychwyn (\\"the red dragon takes the lead\\") to the flag. This was poorly received, and six years later Queen Elizabeth II intervened to put the current flag in place. The daffodil is a more recent development, becoming popular during the 19th century. It may have been linked to the leek; the Welsh for daffodil (cenhinen Bedr) translates as \\"St Peter's leek\\". During the 20th century, the daffodil rose to rival the prominence of the leek as a symbol of Wales. Prime Minister David Lloyd George ensured that the daffodil had a place in the investiture of Edward, Prince of Wales. The traditional Welsh costume and Welsh hat were well known during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Princess Alexandrina Victoria (later Queen Victoria) had a hat made for her when she visited Wales in 1832. The hat was popularised by Sydney Curnow Vosper's 1908 painting Salem, but by then its use had declined. Language The two main languages of Wales are English and Welsh. Throughout the centuries, the Welsh language has been a central factor in the concept of Wales as a nation. Undoubtedly the strongest of the Celtic languages, figures released by the Office of National Statistics taken from the 2011 census, show that Welsh is spoken by 19% of the population. Religion The Flag of Saint David. Before the Roman occupation, the dominant religion in Wales was a pagan one, led by the druids. Little is known about the traditions and ceremonies, but Tacitus, whose claims were sometimes exaggerated, stated that they performed human sacrifice: he says that in AD 61, an altar on Anglesey was found to be \\"drenched with the blood of their prisoners\\". Christianity was introduced to Wales through the Romans, and after they abandoned the British Isles, it survived in South East Wales at Hentland. In the 6th century, this was home to Dubricius, the first Celtic saint. The largest religion in modern Wales is Christianity, with almost 58% of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. The Presbyterian Church of Wales was for many years the largest denomination; it was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811; The Church in Wales had an average Sunday attendance of 32,171 in 2012. It forms part of the Anglican Communion, and was also part of the Church of England, but was disestablished by the British Government in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914. Non-Christian religions have relatively few followers in Wales, with Muslims making up 1.5% of the population while Hindus and Buddhists represent 0.3% each in the 2011 census. Over 32% of the population in Wales did not note a religion. Research in 2007 by the Tearfund organisation showed that Wales had the lowest average church attendance in the UK, with 12% of the population routinely attending. Festivals The patron saint of Wales is Saint David, Dewi Sant in Welsh. St. David's Day is celebrated on 1 March, which some people argue should be designated a public holiday in Wales. Other days which have been proposed for national public commemorations are 16 September (the day on which Owain Glynd≈µr's rebellion began) and 11 December (the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd). The traditional seasonal festivals in Wales are: * Calan Gaeaf (a Hallowe'en or Samhain-type festival on the first day of winter) * G≈µyl Fair y Canhwyllau (literally Mary's Festival of the Candles, i.e. Candlemas; also coinciding with Imbolc)(translated from Welsh) * Calan Mai (May Day, and similar to Beltane) * Calan Awst (1 August, equivalent to Lammas and Lughnasa) * G≈µyl Mabsant celebrated by each parish in commemoration of its native saint, often marked by a fair * Dydd Santes Dwynwen, a Welsh equivalent to St Valentine's Day * Calennig is a Welsh New Year celebration Arts =Visual arts= Many works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales participated in the Insular art of the British Isles and a number of illuminated manuscripts possibly of Welsh origin survive, of which the 8th century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels are the most notable. The 11th century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's, and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. The best of the few Welsh artists of the 16th‚Äì18th centuries tended to move elsewhere to work, but in the 18th century the dominance of landscape art in English art motivated them to stay at home, and brought an influx of artists from outside to paint Welsh scenery. The Welsh painter Richard Wilson (1714‚Äì1782) is arguably the first major British landscapist, but rather more notable for Italian scenes than Welsh ones, although he did paint several on visits from London. Thomas Jones (1742‚Äì1803) It remained difficult for artists relying on the Welsh market to support themselves until well into the 20th century. An Act of Parliament in 1854 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom, and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists, and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881.Royal Cambrian Academy The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists, based respectively in the United States and France. Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin, but spent little time in Wales. Perhaps the most famous Welsh painters, Augustus John and his sister Gwen John, mostly lived in London and Paris; however the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast remained living in Wales for most of their lives, though well in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff, and even after moving to London; he was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-born Welshman David Jones, and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes. =Ceramics= Historically, there were three main areas of pottery production in Wales: south-west Wales, northern Monmouthshire and the Vale of Glamorgan. Several further sites can be identified through their place names, for example Pwllcrochan (a hamlet near Milford Haven estuary in Pembrokeshire), which translates to Crock Pool, and archaeology has also revealed former kiln sites across the country. These were often located near clay beds, for ease of resource gathering. Buckley and Ewenny became leading areas of pottery production in Wales during the 17th and 18th centuries; these are applied as generic terms to different potters within those areas during this period. South Wales had several notable potteries during that same period, an early exponent being the Cambrian Pottery (1764‚Äì1870, also known as \\"Swansea pottery\\"). The works from Cambrian attempted to imitate those of Wedgwood. Nantgarw Pottery, near Cardiff, was in operation from 1813 to 1823 making fine porcelain. Llanelly Pottery was the last surviving major pottery works in South Wales when it closed in 1922. =Literature= =Theatre= Theatrical performances are thought to have begun after the Roman invasion of Britain. There are remains of a Roman amphitheatre at Caerleon, which would have served the nearby fortress of Isca Augusta. Between Roman and modern times, theatre in Wales was limited to performances of travelling players, sometimes in temporary structures. Welsh theatrical groups also performed in England, as did English groups in Wales. The rise of the Puritans in the 17th century and then Methodism during the 18th century caused declines in Welsh theatre as performances were seen as immoral. Despite this, performances continued on showgrounds, and with a handful of travelling groups of actors. The Savoy Theatre, Monmouth, the oldest theatre still in operation in Wales, was built during the 19th century and originally operated as the Assembly Rooms. Other theatres opened over the following decades, with Cardiff's Theatre Royal opening in 1827. After a fire, a replacement Theatre Royal opened in 1878. Competition for theatres led to further buildings being constructed, such as the New Theatre, Cardiff, which opened on 10 December 1906. =Television= Television in the United Kingdom started in 1936 as a public service which was free of advertising, but did not arrive in Wales until the opening of the Wenvoe transmitter in August 1952. Initially all programmes were in the English language, although under the leadership of Welsh director and controller Alun Oldfield-Davies, occasional Welsh language programmes were broadcast during closed periods, replacing the test card. In 1958, responsibility for programming in Wales fell to Television Wales and the West, although Welsh language broadcasting was mainly served by the Manchester-based Granada company, producing about an hour a week. On the 1 November 1982, S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru) was launched bringing together the BBC, HTV and other independent producers to provide an initial service of 22 hours of Welsh-language television. With the completion of the digital switchover in Wales on 31 March 2010‚Äîwhich made English-language Channel 4 available across Wales‚ÄîS4C's bilingual analogue channel closed, and what had been S4C Digidol became the default S4C channel, available on Freeview and pay television, and broadcasting entirely in Welsh. The decision by Julie Gardner, Head of Drama for BBC Wales, to film and produce the 2005 revived version of Doctor Who in Wales is widely seen as a bellwether moment for the industry for the nation. This in turn was followed by the opening of the Roath Lock production studios in Cardiff. Recent English language programmes that have been filmed in Wales include Sherlock and His Dark Materials, while other popular series, such as Hinterland (Y Gwyll) and Keeping Faith (Un Bore Mercher) have been filmed in both Welsh and English. =Film= The Cinema of Wales comprises the art of film and creative movies made in Wales or by Welsh filmmakers either locally or abroad. Welsh cinema began in the late-19th century, led by Welsh-based director William Haggar. Wales continued to produce film of varying quality throughout the 20th century, in both the Welsh and English languages, though indigenous production was curtailed through a lack of infrastructure and finance, which prevented the growth of the industry nationally. Despite this, Wales has been represented in all fields of the film making process, producing actors and directors of note. =Music= The Cardiff Arms Park male voice choir Medieval crwth instrument Wales is often referred to as \\"the land of song\\", and is notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The principal Welsh festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod. The Llangollen International Eisteddfod echoes the National Eisteddfod but provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. Traditional music and dance in Wales is supported by many societies. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. Male choirs (sometimes called male voice choirs), which emerged in the 19th century, have remained a lasting tradition in Wales. Originally these choirs were formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. Many of the historic Welsh choirs survive, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires (triple harp), fiddle, crwth, pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. The Cerdd Dant Society promotes its specific singing art primarily through an annual one-day festival. The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. Tom Jones performing with Janis Joplin in 1969 Wales has had a number of successful singers. In the 1960s, these included bands such as Amen Corner and The Iveys/Badfinger and singers including Sir Tom Jones, Dame Shirley Bassey and Mary Hopkin. By the 1980s, indie pop and alternative rock bands such as The Alarm, The Pooh Sticks and The Darling Buds were popular in their genres. But the wider view at the time was that the wider Welsh music scene was stagnant, as the more popular musicians from Wales were from earlier eras. In the 1990s, in England, the Britpop scene was emerging, while in Wales, bands such as Y Cyrff and Ffa Coffi Pawb began to sing in English, starting a culture that would lead to the creation of Catatonia and the Super Furry Animals. The influence of the 80s bands and the emergence of a Welsh language and dual language music scene locally in Wales led to a dramatic shift in opinion across the United Kingdom as the \\"Cool Cymru\\" bands of the period emerged. The leading Welsh band during this period was the Manic Street Preachers, whose 1996 album Everything Must Go has been listed among the greatest albums of all time. Some of those bands have had ongoing success, while the general popularity of Welsh music during this period led to a resurgence of singers such as Tom Jones with his album Reload. It was his first non-compilation number one album since 1968's Delilah. Meanwhile, Shirley Bassey reached the top 20 once more in the UK Charts with her collaboration with the Propellerheads on the single \\"History Repeating\\". They also introduced new acts, such as Catatonia's Owen Powell working with Duffy during her early period. Moving into the 21st century, Bullet For My Valentine were named the Best British Band at the Kerrang! Awards for three years running. Other successful bands from this period include Funeral For A Friend, and Lostprophets. Media Sport Rugby Union action from Wales vs. England in 2006 Over fifty national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. The Welsh national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup, with Wales hosting the 1999 tournament. The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were in turn replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Scarlets; Cardiff Blues; Newport Gwent Dragons; and the Ospreys. The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 league, the Anglo-Welsh Cup (LV Cup), the European Heineken Cup and the European (Amlin) Challenge Cup. Wales has had its own association football league since 1992. For historical and other reasons, two Welsh clubs (Cardiff City and Swansea City) play in the English Football League. Another three Welsh clubs play in English football's feeder leagues: Wrexham, Newport County and Merthyr Town. This also qualifies those teams to compete for England's domestic trophies. On 23 April 1927, Cardiff City became the only team outside England to win the FA Cup. In European football competitions, only teams playing in the Welsh leagues are eligible to play for Wales. The five teams in the English leagues are eligible to represent England only, and they are not allowed to compete for domestic Welsh trophies. Welsh athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson won 11 Paralympic gold medals In international cricket, Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team, or simply \\"England\\". Occasionally, a separate Wales national cricket team plays in limited-overs competitions, mainly against English county teams. Glamorgan is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. Plaid Cymru have argued that Wales should have its own international team and withdraw from the existing arrangement under which Welsh players play for England. The proposal has aroused opposition from Cricket Wales and Glamorgan County Cricket Club, who argue such a move would be financially disastrous. The debate focused on a report produced by the Welsh National Assembly's petitions committee, which reflected the arguments on both sides. Bethan Jenkins, Plaid Cymru's spokesperson on heritage, culture, sport and broadcasting, and a member of the petitions committee, said: \\"Cricket Wales and Glamorgan CCC say the idea of a Welsh national cricket team is ‚Äòan emotive subject‚Äô. Of course having a national team is emotive. You only have to look at the stands during any national game to see that. To suggest this as anything other than natural is a bit of a misleading argument.\\" In their strategic plan, Cricket Wales state they are \\"committed to continuing to play a major role within the ECB\\" Wales has produced several world-class participants in individual sports, including snooker players Ray Reardon, Terry Griffiths, Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens. Successful track athletes include miler Jim Alford who was a world record holder in the 4 x 1500 metres relay, the 110-metre hurdler Colin Jackson who is a former world record holder and the winner of numerous Olympic, World and European medals, and Tanni Grey-Thompson who has won 11 Paralympic gold medals. Wales has also produced a number of world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO World Super- Middleweight Champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super- middleweight and Ring Magazine Light-Heavyweight titles. Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli, Freddie Welsh, Howard Winstone, Percy Jones, Jimmy Wilde, Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan. Cuisine A white Welsh Mountain Sheep Wales is not considered to have a strong food identity; some people consider that there is \\"no such thing as Welsh food\\". Welsh cookery is said to be similar to English cuisine in style. However, there are regional variations in the food seen across Wales, which can be traced historically to the availability of certain crops and produce in specific areas of the country. The cuisine of Gower is particularly different to the rest of Wales. It was strongly influenced by Somerset and Devon, and developed dishes such as whitepot while ingredients such as pumpkin were used, which are unusual in the rest of Wales. Cattle farming produces the majority of Wales' agricultural output. Welsh beef is protected under European Union law, meaning that it must be produced and slaughtered in Wales. Welsh pigs are raised, providing good cuts of meat. The mountainous areas of Wales are suited to sheep farming and this has led to an association of their meat with the country. The mutton of Wales has been popular in the rest of the United Kingdom since the 16th century, and by the end of the 20th century there were more than 11 million sheep in Wales. Cawl, a Welsh dish of meat and vegetables Several Welsh dishes are thought of as Welsh because their ingredients are associated with Wales, whereas others have been developed there. Cawl is regarded as the Welsh national dish; it is a slow-cooked meat and vegetable broth. Traditionally it was a vegetable-heavy dish, but now it is more likely to contain beef or lamb. Welsh rarebit is thought to date from the 18th century, although the original term \\"Welsh rabbit\\" may have been intended as a slur against the Welsh. Another use of cheese in a traditional Welsh dish is seen in Glamorgan sausage, which is a skinless sausage made of cheese and either leek or spring onion, which is then rolled into a sausage shape before frying. Laverbread is made using a pur√©e of seaweed, and is traditionally served in a Welsh breakfast. Welsh cakes are made on a bakestone, and are small round spiced cakes containing raisins, sultanas and occasionally currants. Bara brith contains similar ingredients to Welsh cakes, but is similar to a tea bread. Crempog - Anglesey style The Welsh have their own versions of pancakes: crempogau (sing. crempog) (sometimes called ffroes, sing. ffroesen) are traditionally layered on top of each other to form a large cake. Some are very much like American pancakes; others may be made with yeast (called crempogau burum, sing. crempog furum) or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes.Freeman, Bobby (2006) First catch your peacock: her classic guide to Welsh food, Y Lolfa; New edition, pp. 195‚Äì196Tibbit, Sara Minwell (1991) Baking in Wales, National Museums and Galleries of Wales, p. 13 Beer is the national drink of Wales, despite the influence of the temperance movement in Wales. The Wrexham Lager Beer Company was the first successful lager producer in Britain when it opened in 1882, and the Felinfoel Brewery was the first brewery in Europe to put beer in cans. Whisky production in Wales was historically a niche industry, and completely shut down in 1910 when the last distillery was bought out by a Scottish firm. However, the Penderyn distillery produced the first Wales-created whisky in a century to go on sale when it was launched in 2004. There are 20 Welsh vineyards producing 100,000 bottles of wine a year in total.

The film is wide. Each image is 36√ó24 mm in the most common \\"full- frame\\" format (sometimes called \\"double-frame\\" for its relationship to the \\"single-frame\\" 35 mm movie format). Leica I, 1927, the first camera worldwide with 135 film 135 film, better known as 35 mm film, is a format of photographic film used for still photography. It is a cartridge film with a film gauge of , typically used for hand-held photography in 35 mm film cameras. Its engineering standard for the film is controlled by ISO 1007. The term 135 (ISO 1007) was introduced by Kodak in 1934 as a designation for the cassette for 35 mm film, specifically for still photography. It quickly grew in popularity, surpassing 120 film by the late 1960s to become the most popular photographic film size. Despite competition from formats such as 828, 126, 110, and APS, it remains so today. 135 camera film always comes perforated with Kodak Standard perforations. The size of the 135 film frame has been adopted by many high-end digital single-lens reflex and digital mirrorless cameras, commonly referred to as \\"full frame\\". Even though the format is much smaller than historical medium format and large format film, it is much larger than image sensors in most compact cameras and smart phone cameras.  Characteristics  = Cassette = A roll of Kodak 35 mm film for cameras Individual rolls of 135 film are enclosed in single-spool, light- tight, metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight. The film is clipped or taped to a spool and exits via a slot lined with flocking. The end of the film is cut on one side to form a leader. It has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as 35 mm movie print film (also called \\"long pitch\\", KS-1870, whereas 35 mm professional motion picture camera films are always \\"short pitch\\", BH-1866). Most cameras require the film to be rewound before the camera is opened. Some motorized cameras unwind the film fully upon loading and then expose the images in reverse order, returning the film to the cassette; this protects all images except the last one or two, should the camera back be accidentally opened. Disposable cameras use the same technique so that the user does not have to rewind. Since the 1980s, film cassettes have been marked with a DX encoding 6-digit barcode pattern, which identifies the manufacturer and film type (and thus processing method), and the number of exposures, for the use of photofinishing laboratories. The cassettes are also manufactured with a Camera Auto Sensing code constructed as two rows of six rectangular areas on the metal cassette surface which are either conductive or insulating, representing 32 possible film speeds, 8 possible film lengths, and 4 possible values of exposure tolerance or latitude. Conforming cameras detect at least some of these areas; only 3 contacts are needed to set a light meter for the 4 most popular film speeds. =Film type and speed= 135 film has been made in several emulsion types and sensitivities (film speeds), standardised by ISO. Since the introduction of digital cameras the most usual films have colour emulsions of ISO 100/21¬∞ to ISO 800/30¬∞. Films of lower sensitivity (and better picture quality) and higher sensitivity (for low light) are for more specialist purposes. There are colour and monochrome films, negative and positive. Monochrome film is usually panchromatic; orthochromatic has fallen out of use. Film designed to be sensitive to infrared radiation can be obtained, both monochrome and with false-colour (or pseudocolour) rendition. More exotic emulsions have been available in 135 than other roll-film sizes. = Image format = 135 frame and perforations The term 135 format usually refers to a 36√ó24 mm film format, commonly known as 35 mm format. The 36√ó24 mm format is common to digital image sensors, where it is typically referred to as full frame format. On 135 film, the longer dimension of the 36√ó24 mm frame runs parallel to the length of the film. The perforation size and pitch are according to the standard specification KS-1870. For each frame, the film advances 8 perforations. This is specified as 38.00 mm. This allows for 2 mm gaps between frames. Camera models typically have different locations for the sprocket which advances the film. Therefore, each camera model's frame may vary in position relative to the perforations. The film is approximately 0.14 mm thick. Other image formats have been applied to 135 film, such as the half-frame format of 18√ó24 mm which earned some popularity in the 1960s, and the 24√ó24 mm of the Robot cameras. The successful range of Olympus Pen F cameras utilized the smaller half-frame size, allowing the design of a very compact SLR camera. Unusual formats include the 24√ó32 mm and 24√ó34 mm on the early Nikon rangefinders, and 24√ó23 mm for use with some stereo cameras. In 1967, the Soviet KMZ factory introduced a 24√ó58 mm panoramic format with its Horizont camera (descendants of which are called, in the Roman alphabet, Horizon). In 1998, Hasselblad and Fuji introduced a 24√ó65 mm panoramic format with the XPan/TX-1 camera. There is also a 21√ó14 mm format used by Tessina subminiature camera. Half-frame negatives (left and right) with standard 35 mm (centre) = Length = The film is available in lengths for varying numbers of exposures. The standard full-length roll has always been 36 exposures (assuming a standard 24√ó36 frame size). Through about 1980, 20 exposure rolls were the only shorter length with widespread availability. Since then, 20 exposure rolls have been largely discontinued in favour of 24 and 12 exposure rolls. With most cameras it is possible to get up to 3 more exposures than the nominal capacity on the film if the camera is loaded in a darkroom and some cameras allow this with daylight loading. 27 exposure disposable cameras are loaded in the dark with standard 24 exposure cassette. Other, mostly shorter lengths have been manufactured. There have been some 6, 8, 10, and 15 exposure rolls given away as samples, sometimes in disposable cameras, or used by insurance adjusters to document damage claims. 12 exposure rolls have been used widely in the daily press. Photographers who load their own cassettes can use any length of film ‚Äì with thinner film base up to 45 exposures will fit. Ilford at one time made HP5 black-and-white film on a thin polyester base, which allowed 72 exposures in a single cassette. They produced special reels and tanks to allow this to be processed.  History  = 35 mm still cameras = Smena 6 with 35 mm films. The 135 film size is derived from earlier still cameras using lengths of 35 mm cine film, the same size as, but with different perforations than, 135 film. The 35 mm film standard for motion picture film was established in Thomas Edison's lab by William Kennedy Laurie Dickson. Dickson took 70 mm film stock supplied by George Eastman's Eastman Kodak Company. The 70 mm film was cut lengthwise into two equal width (35 mm) strips, spliced together end to end, and then perforated along both edges. The original picture size was 18√ó24 mm (half the full frame size later used in still photography). There were four perforations on each side of a motion picture frame. While the Leica camera popularized the format, several 35 mm still cameras used perforated movie film before the Leica was introduced in the 1920s. The first patent for one was issued to Leo, Audobard and Baradat in England in 1908. The first full-scale production camera was the Homeos, a stereo camera, produced by Jules Richard in 1913, and was sold until 1920. It took 18x24 mm stereo pairs, using two Tessar lenses. In 1909, the French designed a device small-format photography, the \\"\\", which used the 35 mm perforated film to take consecutive hundred views in 18√ó24 mm. He manufactured, won the gold medal in the Concours L√©pine, and in 1910 sold at a small scale and without much success. The first big-selling 35 mm still camera was the American Tourist Multiple, which also appeared in 1913, at a cost of $175 (at today's prices, the same cost as a modern $3000 Leica.) The first camera to take full-frame 24√ó36 mm exposures seems to be the Simplex, introduced in the U.S. in 1914. It took either 800 half-frame or 400 full- frame shots on 50 ft (15.2 m) rolls. The Minigraph, by Levy-Roth of Berlin, another half-frame small camera was sold in Germany in 1915. The patent for the Debrie Sept camera, a combination 35 mm still and movie camera was issued in 1918; the camera sold from 1922. The Furet camera made and sold in France in 1923 took full-frame 24x36 mm negatives, and was the first cheap small 35 mm camera of similar appearance to more modern models. = Leica = Replica of a Leica prototype, 1913 The Leica camera designed by Oskar Barnack used 35 mm film, and proved that a format as small as 24 mm √ó 36 mm was suitable for professional photography. Although Barnack designed his prototype camera around 1913, the first experimental production run of ur-Leicas (Serial No. 100 to 130) did not take place until 1923. Full-scale production of the Leica did not begin until 1925. While by that time there were at least a dozen other 35 mm cameras available, the Leica was a success, and came to be associated with the format. Mostly because of this 35 mm popularity, as well as the entire company legacy, early Leica cameras are considered as highly collectible items these days. The original Leica prototype holds the record as being the world's most expensive camera, selling for ‚Ç¨2.16 million in 2012. = Pre loaded cassettes and Kodak Retina cameras = Kodak Retina II In the earliest days, the photographer had to load the film into reusable cassettes and, at least for some cameras, cut the film leader. In 1934, Kodak introduced a 135 daylight-loading single-use cassette. This cassette was engineered so that it could be used in both Leica and Zeiss Ikon Contax cameras along with the camera for which it was invented, namely the Kodak Retina camera. The Retina camera and this daylight loading cassette were the invention of Dr. August Nagel of the Kodak AG Dr. Nagel Werk in Stuttgart. Kodak bought Dr. August Nagel's company in December, 1931, and began marketing the Kodak Retina in the summer of 1934. The first Kodak Retina camera was a Typ 117. The 35 mm Kodak Retina camera line remained in production until 1969. Kodak also introduced a line of American made cameras that were simpler and more economical than the Retina. Argus, too, made a long-lived range of 35 mm cameras; notably the Argus C3. Kodak launched 135-format Kodachrome color film in 1936. AGFA followed with the introduction of Agfacolor Neu later in the same year. The designations 235 and 435 refer to 35 mm film in daylight- loading spools, that could be loaded into Leica or Contax style reusable cassettes without need of a darkroom. The 335 was a daylight loading spool for the 24 √ó 23 mm stereo format. = The reflex camera = Nikon F chrome with eyelevel prism and NIKKOR-S Auto 1:1,4 f=5,8cm lens (1959) ‚Äì an early SLR system camera. Reflex viewfinders, both twin-and single-lens, had been used with earlier cameras using plates and rollfilm. The first 35 mm single-lens reflex (SLR) was the Kine Exakta, introduced in 1936. World War II interrupted development of the type. After the war, Exakta resumed development and the Contax S model with the now familiar pentaprism viewing feature was introduced in 1949. In the 1950s, the SLR also began to be produced in Japan by such companies as Asahi and Miranda. Asahi's Pentax introduced the instant-return mirror, important for the popularity of SLRs; until then, the viewfinder on an SLR camera blanked as the mirror sprang out of the optical path just before taking the picture, returning when the film was wound on. Nikon's F model, introduced in March 1959, was a system camera that greatly improved the quality and utility of 35 mm format cameras, encouraging professionals (especially photojournalists) to switch from larger format cameras to the versatile, rugged, and fast SLR design. Numerous other film formats waxed and waned in popularity, but by the 1970s, interchangeable-lens SLR cameras and smaller rangefinders, from expensive Leicas to \\"point-and-shoot\\" pocket cameras, were all using 35 mm film, and manufacturers had proliferated. Colour films improved, both for print negatives and reversal slides, while black-and- white films offered smoother grain and faster speeds than previously available. Since 35 mm was preferred by both amateur and professional photographers, makers of film stock have long offered the widest range of different film speeds and types in the format. The DX film-speed encoding system was introduced in the 1980s, as were single-use cameras pre-loaded with 35 mm film and using plastic lenses of reasonable enough quality to produce acceptable snapshots. Automated all-in-one processing and printing machines made 35 mm developing easier and less expensive, so that quality colour prints became available not only from photographic specialty stores, but also from supermarkets, drugstores, and big box retailers, often in less than an hour. =From 1996= In 1996, a smaller format called Advanced Photo System (APS) was introduced by a consortium of photographic companies in an attempt to supersede 135 film. Due in part to its small negative size, APS was not taken seriously as a professional format, despite the production of APS SLRs. In the point-and-shoot markets at which the format was primarily aimed, it enjoyed moderate initial success, but still never rivalled the market penetration of 135. Within five years of its launch, cheap digital compact cameras started becoming widely available, and APS sales plummeted. Nikon F6 ‚Äì The last Nikon F series 35mm SLR introduced in 2004, which remains in production as of 2017. Such digital compact cameras also eroded the market for 35 mm compact cameras. Digital SLRs at a price (and quality) comparable with consumer-level 35 mm SLRs were developed, further reducing the demand for 135 film. Most of these use so-called \\"APS-C\\" sized sensors, approximately 16√ó24 mm in size (half- frame). A few digital SLRs use \\"full frame\\" sensors, the same size as 135 film. Sales of all film sizes declined to a very large extent; of the remaining sizes, 135 is the most popular. While they have shifted the vast majority of their product lines to digital, major camera manufacturers such as Canon and Nikon continue to make expensive professional-grade 35 mm film SLRs (such as the Canon EOS-1v and the Nikon F6). Introductory 35 mm SLRs, compact film point-and-shoot cameras, and single-use cameras continue to be built and sold by a number of makers. Leica finally introduced the digital Leica M8 rangefinder in 2007, but continues to make its M series rangefinder film cameras and lenses. A digital camera back for the Leica R9 SLR camera was discontinued in 2007. On March 25, 2009, Leica discontinued the R9 SLR and R-series lenses.

Measured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 172 is the most successful aircraft in history. Cessna delivered the first production model in 1956, and , the company and its partners had built more than 44,000 units.Cessna homepage: Skyhawk . Retrieved 2015-01-22 The aircraft remains in production today. The Skyhawk's main competitors have been the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman AA-5 series (neither currently in production), the Piper Cherokee, and, more recently, the Diamond DA40 and Cirrus SR20. Design and development The Cessna 172 started life as a tricycle landing gear variant of the taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment. In January 1955, Cessna flew an improved variant of the Cessna 170, a Continental O-300-A-powered Cessna 170C with larger elevators and a more angular tailfin. Although the variant was tested and certified, Cessna decided to modify it with a tricycle landing gear, and the modified Cessna 170C flew again on June 12, 1955. To reduce the time and cost of certification, the type was added to the Cessna 170 type certificate as the Model 172. Later, the 172 was given its own type certificate. The 172 became an overnight sales success, and over 1,400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production.Clark, Anders (1 January 2015). \\"Cessna 172 Skyhawk \\". Disciples of Flight. Retrieved 12 August 2015 A 1960 Cessna 172A Early 172s were similar in appearance to the 170s, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall landing gear legs, although the 172 had a straight tailfin while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. In 1960, the 172A incorporated revised landing gear and the swept-back tailfin, which is still in use today. The final aesthetic development, found in the 1963 172D and all later 172 models, was a lowered rear deck allowing an aft window. Cessna advertised this added rear visibility as \\"Omni-Vision.\\" Production halted in the mid-1980s, but resumed in 1996 with the 160 hp (120 kW) Cessna 172R Skyhawk. Cessna supplemented this in 1998 with the 180 hp (135 kW) Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP. =Modifications= The Cessna 172 may be modified via a wide array of supplemental type certificates (STCs), including increased engine power and higher gross weights. Available STC engine modifications increase power from , add constant-speed propellers, or allow the use of automobile gasoline. Other modifications include additional fuel tank capacity in the wing tips, added baggage compartment tanks, added wheel pants to reduce drag, or enhanced landing and takeoff performance and safety with a STOL kit. AOPA Pilot, May/July 1994 The 172 has also been equipped with the fuel injected Superior Air Parts Vantage engine. Operational history =World records= The record-setting 1958-built Cessna 172 From December 4, 1958, to February 7, 1959, Robert Timm and John Cook set the world record for (refueled) flight endurance in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B. They took off from McCarran Airfield in Las Vegas, Nevada, and landed back at McCarran Airfield after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in flight. The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund. Variants 1956 Cessna 172, Toowoomba, Australia, 2010 Early Cessna 172s, like this 1957 model, had a \\"fastback\\" rear cabin with no rear window and featured a \\"square\\" fin design. Cessna has historically used model years similar to a U.S. auto manufacturer, with sales of new models typically starting a few months prior to the actual calendar year. ;172 The basic 172 appeared in November 1955 as the 1956 model and remained in production until replaced by the 172A in early 1960. It was equipped with a Continental O-300 six-cylinder, air-cooled engine and had a maximum gross weight of . Introductory base price was US$8,995 and a total of 4,195 were constructed over the five years.Clarke, Bill: The Cessna 172 First Edition. TAB Books, 1987. ;172A The 1960 model 172A introduced a swept-back tailfin and rudder, as well as float fittings. The price was US$9,450 and 1,015 were built. ;172B The 172B was introduced in late 1960 as the 1961 model and featured a shorter landing gear, engine mounts lengthened three inches (76 mm), a reshaped cowling, and a pointed propeller spinner.Phillips, Edward H: Wings of Cessna, Model 120 to the Citation III, Flying Books, 1986. For the first time, the \\"Skyhawk\\" name was applied to an available deluxe option package. This added optional equipment included full exterior paint to replace the standard partial paint stripes and standard avionics. The gross weight was increased to . ;172C The 1962 model was the 172C. It brought to the line an optional autopilot and a key starter to replace the previous pull-starter. The seats were redesigned to be six-way adjustable. A child seat was made optional to allow two children to be carried in the baggage area. The 1962 price was US$9,895. A total of 889 172C models were produced. 1963 Cessna 172D ;172D The 1963 172D model introduced the lower rear fuselage with a wraparound Omni-Vision rear window and a one-piece windshield. Gross weight was increased to , where it would stay until the 172P. New rudder and brake pedals were also added. 1,146 172Ds were built. 1963 also saw the introduction of the 172D Powermatic, powered by a Continental GO-300E, increasing cruise speed by relative to the standard 172D. In reality this was not a new model, but rather a Cessna 175 Skylark that had been rebranded to overcome a reputation for poor engine reliability. The ploy was unsuccessful and neither the Powermatic nor the Skylark were produced again after the 1963 model year. ;172E The 172E was the 1964 model. The electrical fuses were replaced with circuit breakers. The 172E also featured a redesigned instrument panel. 1,401 172Es were built that year as production continued to increase. 1964 Cessna 172F ; The 1965 model 172F introduced electrically operated flaps to replace the previous lever-operated system. It was built in France by Reims Cessna as the F172 until 1971. These models formed the basis for the U.S. Air Force's T-41A Mescalero primary trainer, which was used during the 1960s and early 1970s as initial flight screening aircraft in USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT). Following their removal from the UPT program, some extant USAF T-41s were assigned to the U.S. Air Force Academy for the cadet pilot indoctrination program, while others were distributed to Air Force aero clubs. A total of 1,436 172Fs were completed. ;172G 1966 Cessna F172G The 1966 model year 172G introduced a more pointed spinner and sold for US$12,450 in its basic 172 version and US$13,300 in the upgraded Skyhawk version. 1,597 were built. ;172H The 1967 model 172H was the last Continental O-300 powered model. It also introduced a shorter-stroke nose gear oleo to reduce drag and improve the appearance of the aircraft in flight. A new cowling was used, introducing shock-mounts that transmitted lower noise levels to the cockpit and reduced cowl cracking. The electric stall warning horn was replaced by a pneumatic one. The 1967 model 172H sold for US$10,950 while the Skyhawk version was US$12,750.Simpson 1991, p. 98. A total of 839 172Hs were built. ;172I Lycoming O-320-E2D engine of . The 1968 model marked the beginning of the Lycoming- powered 172s. The \\"I\\" model was introduced with a Lycoming O-320-E2D engine of , an increase of over the Continental powerplant. The increased power resulted in an increase in optimal cruise from TAS to TAS (true airspeed). There was no change in the sea level rate of climb at per minute. The 172I also introduced the first standard \\"T\\" instrument arrangement. The 172I saw an increase in production over the \\"H\\" model, with 1,206 built. ;172J For 1968, Cessna planned to replace the 172 with a newly-designed aircraft called the 172J, featuring the same general configuration but with a more sloping windshield, a strutless cantilever wing, a more stylish interior, and various other improvements. However, the popularity of the previous 172 with Cessna dealers and flight schools prompted the cancellation of the replacement plan, and the 172J was instead introduced as the 177 and sold alongside the 172. The 172J designation was never used for a production aircraft. 1969 model-year Cessna 172K, built in 1968 ; The next model year was the 1969 \\"K\\" model. The 1969 172K had a redesigned tailfin cap and reshaped rear windows. Optional long-range wing fuel tanks were offered. The rear windows were slightly enlarged by . The 1969 model sold for US$12,500 for the 172 and US$13,995 for the Skyhawk, with 1,170 made. The 1970 model was still called the 172K, but sported fiberglass, downward-shaped, conical wing tips. Fully articulated seats were offered as well. Production in 1970 was 759 units. ;172L 1971 Cessna 172L at Kemble Airfield, England, 2003 The 172L, sold during 1971 and 1972, replaced the main landing gear legs (which were originally flat spring steel) with tapered, tubular steel gear legs. The new gear had a width that was increased by . The new tubular gear was lighter, but required aerodynamic fairings to maintain the same speed and climb performance as experienced with the flat steel design. The \\"L\\" also had a plastic fairing between the dorsal fin and vertical fin to introduce a greater family resemblance to the 182's vertical fin. The 1971 model sold for US$13,425 in the 172 version and US$14,995 in the Skyhawk version. 827 172Ls were sold in 1971 and 984 in 1972. ; 1977 Cessna 172M The 172M of 1973‚Äì76 gained a drooped wing leading edge for improved low-speed handling. This was marketed as the \\"camber-lift\\" wing. The 1974 172M was also the first to introduce the optional 'II' package which offered higher standard equipment, including a second nav/comm radio, an ADF and transponder. The baggage compartment was increased in size, and nose- mounted dual landing lights were available as an option. The 1975 model 172M sold for US$16,055 for the 172, US$17,890 for the Skyhawk and US$20,335 for the . In 1976, Cessna stopped marketing the aircraft as the 172 and began exclusively using the \\"Skyhawk\\" designation. This model year also saw a redesigned instrument panel to hold more avionics. Among other changes, the fuel and other small gauges were relocated to the left side for improved pilot readability compared with the earlier 172 panel designs. Total production of \\"M\\" models was 7306 over the four years it was manufactured. 1979 Cessna 172N Skyhawk in 2019 ; The Skyhawk N, or Skyhawk/100 as Cessna termed it, was introduced for the 1977 model year. The \\"100\\" designation indicated that it was powered by a Lycoming O-320-H2AD, engine designed to run on 100-octane fuel, whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel. But this engine proved troublesome, and it was replaced by the similarly rated O-320-D2J to create the 1981 172P. The 1977 \\"N\\" model 172 also introduced rudder trim as an option and standard \\"pre-selectable\\" flaps. The price was US$22,300, with the selling for US$29,950. The 1978 model brought a 28-volt electrical system to replace the previous 14-volt system. Air conditioning was an option. The 1979 model \\"N\\" increased the flap-extension speed for the first 10 degrees to . Larger wing tanks increased the optional fuel to . The \\"N\\" remained in production until 1980 when the 172P or Skyhawk P was introduced. ;172O There was no \\"O\\" (\\"Oscar\\") model 172, to avoid confusion with the number zero. ; Cessna 172P The 172P, or Skyhawk P, was introduced in 1981 to solve the reliability problems of the \\"N\\" engine. by replacing it with the Lycoming O-320-D2J. The \\"P\\" model also saw the maximum flap deflection decreased from 40 degrees to 30 to allow a gross weight increase from to . A wet wing was optional, with a capacity of 62 US gallons of fuel. The price of a new Skyhawk P was US$33,950, with the Skyhawk costing US$37,810 and the Nav/Pac equipped Skyhawk selling for US$42,460. In 1982, the \\"P\\" saw the landing lights moved from the nose to the wing to increase bulb life. The 1983 model added some minor soundproofing improvements and thicker windows. A second door latch pin was introduced in 1984. Production of the \\"P\\" ended in 1986, and no more 172s were built for eleven years as legal liability rulings in the US had pushed Cessna's insurance costs too high, resulting in dramatically increasing prices for new aircraft. There were only 195 172s built in 1984, a rate of fewer than four per week. ; The 172Q was introduced in 1983 and given the name Cutlass to create an affiliation with the 172RG, although it was actually a 172P with a Lycoming O-360-A4N engine of . The aircraft had a gross weight of and an optimal cruise speed of compared to the 172P's cruise speed of on less. It had a useful load that was about more than the Skyhawk P and a rate of climb that was actually per minute lower, due to the higher gross weight. Production ended after only three years when all 172 production stopped. ;172R The Skyhawk R was introduced in 1996 and is powered by a derated Lycoming IO-360-L2A producing a maximum of at just 2,400 rpm. This is the first Cessna 172 to have a factory-fitted fuel-injected engine. The 172R's maximum takeoff weight is . This model year introduced many improvements, including a new interior with soundproofing, an all new multi-level ventilation system, a standard four point intercom, contoured, energy absorbing, 26g front seats with vertical and reclining adjustments and inertia reel harnesses. ; Cessna 172S Skyhawk, built 2001, at Bristol Airport, Bristol, England (2014) The Cessna 172S was introduced in 1998 and is powered by a Lycoming IO-360-L2A producing . The maximum engine rpm was increased from 2,400 rpm to 2,700 rpm resulting in a increase over the \\"R\\" model. As a result, the maximum takeoff weight was increased to . This model is marketed under the name Skyhawk SP, although the Type Certification data sheet specifies it is a 172S. The 172S is built primarily for the private owner-operator and is, in its later years, offered with the Garmin G1000 avionics package and leather seats as standard equipment. As of 2009, only the S model is in production. ;Cessna 172RG Cutlass Cessna 172RG retracting its landing gear during take-off Cessna introduced a retractable landing gear version of the 172 in 1980 and named it the Cutlass 172RG. The Cutlass featured a variable-pitch, constant- speed propeller and a more powerful Lycoming O-360-F1A6 engine of . The 172RG sold for about US$19,000 more than the standard 172 of the same year and produced an optimal cruise speed of 140 knots (260 km/h), compared to for the contemporary version. The 172RG did not find wide acceptance in the personal aircraft market because of higher initial and operating costs accompanied by mediocre cruising speed, but was adopted by many flight schools since it met the specific requirements for \\"complex aircraft\\" experience necessary to obtain a Commercial Pilot certificate (the role for which it was intended), at relatively low cost. Between 1980 and 1984 1,177 RGs were built, with a small number following before production ceased in 1985. While numbered and marketed as a 172, the 172RG was actually certified on the Cessna 175 type certificate. = Special versions = ;Reims FR172 and Cessna R172K Hawk XP 1977 Cessna R172K Hawk XP 1977 model R172K Hawk XP on Wipline amphibious floats The FR172 Reims Rocket was produced by Reims Aviation in France from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. It was powered by a Rolls-Royce built, fuel-injected, Continental IO-360-H(B) engine with a constant-speed propeller. Variants included the FR172E until FR172J. The Reims Rocket led to Cessna producing the R172K Hawk XP, a model available from 1977 to 1981 from both Wichita and Reims. This configuration featured a fuel-injected, Continental IO-360K (later IO-360KB) derated to with a two-bladed, constant-speed propeller. The Hawk XP was capable of a cruise speed. Owners claimed that the increased performance of the \\"XP\\" didn't compensate for its increased purchase price and the higher operating costs associated with the larger engine. The aircraft was well accepted for use on floats, however, as the standard 172 is not a strong floatplane, even with only two people on board, while the XP's extra power improves water takeoff performance dramatically. While numbered and marketed as 172s, the R172J and R172K models are actually certified on the Cessna 175 type certificate. ;Turbo Skyhawk JT-A Model introduced in July 2014 for 2015 customer deliveries, powered by a Continental CD-155 diesel engine installed by the factory under a supplemental type certificate. Initial retail price in 2014 was $435,000.Thurber, Matt. \\"AirVenture Report: 2014 \\" AINonline, 1 September 2014. Accessed: 4 September 2014. The model has a top speed of and burns per hour less fuel than the standard 172. As a result, the model has a range, an increase of more than 38% over the standard 172. This model is a development of the proposed and then cancelled Skyhawk TD. Cessna has indicated that the JT-A will be made available in 2016. In reviewing this new model Paul Bertorelli of AVweb said: \\"I‚Äôm sure Cessna will find some sales for the Skyhawk JT-A, but at $420,000, it‚Äôs hard to see how it will ignite much market expansion just because it‚Äôs a Cessna. It gives away $170,000 to the near-new Redbird Redhawk conversion which is a lot of change to pay merely for the smell of a new airplane. Diesel engines cost more than twice as much to manufacture as gasoline engines do and although their fuel efficiency gains back some of that investment, if the complete aircraft package is too pricey, the debt service will eat up any savings, making a new aircraft not just unattractive, but unaffordable. I haven‚Äôt run the numbers on the JT-A yet, but I can tell from previous analysis that there are definite limits.\\" The model was certified by both EASA and the FAA in June 2017. It was discontinued in May 2018, due to poor sales as a result of the aircraft's high price, which was twice the price of the same aircraft as a diesel conversion. The aircraft remains available as an STC conversion from Continental Motors, Inc. ;Electric-powered 172 In July 2010, Cessna announced it was developing an electrically powered 172 as a proof-of-concept in partnership with Bye Energy. In July 2011, Bye Energy, whose name had been changed to Beyond Aviation, announced the prototype had commenced taxi tests on 22 July 2011 and a first flight would follow soon. In 2012, the prototype, using Panacis batteries, engaged in multiple successful test flights. =Canceled model= ;172TD On October 4, 2007, Cessna announced its plan to build a diesel-powered model, to be designated the 172 Skyhawk TD (\\"Turbo Diesel\\") starting in mid-2008. The planned engine was to be a Thielert Centurion 2.0, liquid-cooled, two-liter displacement, dual overhead cam, four-cylinder, in-line, turbo-diesel with full authority digital engine control with an output of and burning Jet-A fuel. In July 2013 the 172TD model was canceled due to Thielert's bankruptcy. The aircraft was later refined into the Turbo Skyhawk JT-A, which was certified in June 2014 and discontinued in May 2018.Goyer, Robert: \\"Skyhawk With a Bang\\", Flying magazine April 2008, pages 64‚Äì68. Hachette Filipacchi US MediaFlying Staff: \\"Parade of Pistons\\", Flying magazine April 2008, page 4. Hachette Filipacchi US Media Simulator company Redbird Flight uses the same engine and reconditioned 172 airframes to produce a similar model, the Redbird Redhawk. Premier Aircraft Sales also announced in February 2014 that it would offer refurbished 172 airframes equipped with the Continental/Thielert Centurion 2.0 diesel engine. Military operators A variant of the 172, the T-41 Mescalero was used as a trainer with the United States Air Force and Army. In addition, the United States Border Patrol uses a fleet of 172s for aerial surveillance along the Mexico-US border. From 1972 to 2019 the Irish Air Corps used the Reims version for aerial surveillance and monitoring of cash, prisoner and explosive escorts, in addition to army cooperation and pilot training roles.

Dakin House dormitory The idea for Hampshire College originated in 1958 when the presidents of Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, appointed a committee to examine the assumptions and practices of liberal arts education. Their report, \\"The New College Plan‚Äù, advocated many of the features that have since been realized in the Hampshire curriculum: inviting students to self- design their program of studies; training students to be able to educate themselves through their lifetimes; emphasis on each student's curiosity and motivation; learning among and across multiple disciplines; and close mentoring relationships with teachers. In 1965, Amherst College alumnus Harold F. Johnson, inspired by the New College Plan, donated $6 million toward the founding of Hampshire College. With a matching grant from the Ford Foundation, Hampshire's first trustees purchased of orchard and farmland in South Amherst, Massachusetts, and construction began. One of the most significant founding documents of Hampshire College is the book The Making of a College (MIT Press, 1967; ), co-written by the College's first president, Franklin Patterson, together with Hampshire's founding employee from Amherst College who would become its second president, Chuck Longsworth. The Making of a College is (as of 2003) out of print but available in electronic form from the Hampshire College Archives. Hampshire admitted its first students in 1970. For several years immediately after its founding in the early 1970s, the large number of applications for matriculation caused Hampshire College to be among the most selective undergraduate programs in the United States.Making of a College pp. 307‚Äì310. Its admissions selectivity declined thereafter because of declining application popularity. The school's number of applications increased again in the late 1990s, causing increased admissions selectivity since then. The college's rate of admissions is now comparable to that of many other small liberal arts colleges. The school has been financially challenged through much of its history, in large part because it lacked a founding endowment to rely on for stability of income, and it has relied substantially on tuition income for operations. As of June 30, 2017, the endowment had risen to $48.5 million. In recent years, the school has been on more solid financial footing, though still lacking a sizable endowment. In recent years its financial stability has relied on fundraising efforts led by its seventh president, Jonathan Lash. In the mid-1990s, the college began establishing a \\"cultural village\\" making possible the residence of independent non-profit organizations on its campus. The cultural village includes the National Yiddish Book Center, the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art and The Hitchcock Center for the Environment.

Adele Simmons served as the College's third president, from 1977 to 1989. Gregory Prince served as its fourth president, from 1989 to 2005, the longest tenure of any Hampshire president. On April 1, 2004, Prince announced his retirement, effective at the end of the 2004‚Äì2005 academic year. On April 5, 2005, the Board of Trustees named Ralph Hexter, formerly a dean at University of California, Berkeley's College of Letters and Science, as the college's next president, effective August 1, 2005. Hexter was inaugurated on October 15, 2005. The appointment made Hampshire one of a small number of colleges and universities in the United States with an openly gay president.The exact number was unclear, but there may have been as few as eight openly gay college and university presidents , and at the time Hexter was named president of Hampshire there were fewer still. \\"Openly Gay Presidents Say Chronicle Article Left Them Out.\\" Chronicle of Higher Education News Blog, August 7, 2007. See also Hexter, Ralph J. \\"Being an 'Out' President.\\" Inside Higher Ed January 25, 2007. Professor Marlene Gerber Fried was interim president for one year from 2010 to 2011. Jonathan Lash was named the sixth president of the College in May, 2011, joining Hampshire as an internationally recognized expert on global sustainability, climate change, and environmental challenges and solutions. He has been appointed by two US Presidents to serve on a national environmental council and commission. Lash served until 2018, and was followed by the College's seventh president, Miriam Nelson, who began her appointment in July, 2018 but resigned in April, 2019 after the failure of her plan for Hampshire to merge or partner with another institution. The Hampshire College Archives in the Harold F. Johnson Library has extensively documented the College's history between 1965 and 2005, accessible on the College's Website. On August 23, 2012, the school announced the establishment of a scholarship fund dedicated to helping undocumented students get degrees. It would give more than $25,000 each year to help an undocumented student pay for the $43,000-plus tuition. =2019 Strategic Partnership and Financial Challenges= On January 15, 2019, president Miriam Nelson and the Board of Trustees announced that due to financial instability the college was planning to seek a strategic partner to ensure long term sustainability. In addition, the college was considering not accepting a new freshman class for Fall 2019 due to concerns with compliance and accreditation. Shortly thereafter, on February 1, 2019, the college announced that for the Fall 2019 semester it would only be admitting students who had already been offered early admission or who had previously deferred admission. Furthermore, early admission students were released from their pledge to attend Hampshire College. Some alumni protested this decision, as well as many students, who organized sit- ins in the Dean of Students office and the Office of the President, demanding more transparency from the administration and board of trustees and for student, staff, and faculty voices to be taken into account in decision-making processes.Krakauer, Jon, \\"A Small New England College Struggles to Survive\\", New York Times, January 31, 2019. Retrieved 2019-03-15. While the occupation in the Dean of Students office ended after a few weeks, the sit-in in the president's office lasted for 75 days, ending on April 22, 2019. On February 19 and 20, following an announcement of the first round of a series of layoffs affecting 30-50% of faculty and staff, Hampshire College faculty attempted to hold a vote of no confidence in President Nelson and the board of trustees. Due to a technicality, this vote was declared invalid and they planned to reschedule the vote, which never happened. SaveHampshire reported from an anonymous source that a vote of no confidence \\"would result in trustees pulling their planned gifts and that Hampshire‚Äôs bonds might then be pulled for immediate payment, causing the school to close in May and leaving faculty and staff without severance pay\\". Members of the Board of Trustees have categorically denied such allegations. On March 31 The Chair of the Board of Trustees resigned. On April 5 Miriam Nelson along with the Vice Chair of the Board and six other trustees resigned. Shortly thereafter the Board of Trustees announced the decision to prioritize remaining independent through a capital campaign led by alumnus Ken Burns. Ken Rosenthal was named interim president. The first round of layoffs primarily affected the admissions and fundraising offices, effective April 19, 2019. In September 2019, there was an incoming class of 13 students and total enrollment was projected to be 600 students (about half of typical enrollment) due to decreased retention rates, however around 750 ended up returning for the fall 2019 semester. =Presidents= *Franklin Patterson (1966‚Äì1971) *Charles R.

From its inception, the curriculum has generally had certain non- traditional features: * An emphasis on project work as well as, or instead of, courses * Detailed written evaluations (as well as portfolio evaluations) for completed courses and projects, rather than letter or number grades * A curriculum centered on student interests, with students taking an active role in designing their own concentrations and projects * An emphasis on independent motivation and student organization, both within and without the college's formal curriculum Emily Dickinson Hall, designed by the architecture firm of former faculty member Norton Juster, houses much of the humanities, creative writing, and theatre The curriculum is divided into three \\"divisions\\" rather than four grade-years: *Division I: Exploration and Working Across Disciplines *Division II: Concentration *Division III: Creating Knowledge =Schools and programs= Cole Science Center contains the School of Natural Science and administrative offices The Hampshire College faculty are organized broadly in defined Schools of thought: *Cognitive Science (CS): includes linguistics, most psychology, some philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science. *Humanities, Arts, and Cultural Studies (HACU): includes film, some studio arts, literature, media studies, architecture, art history, dance, music, and most philosophy. *Critical Social Inquiry (CSI): includes most sociology and anthropology, economics, history, politics, and some psychology. *Natural Science (NS): includes most traditional sciences, mathematics, and biological anthropology. *Interdisciplinary Arts (IA): includes theater, some studio arts, creative writing, and social entrepreneurship. The Five College Program in Peace and World Security Studies (PAWSS) is based at Hampshire; its director is Michael Klare. The national reproductive rights organization Civil Liberties and Public Policy (CLPP) operates on Hampshire's campus, where they host an annual conference. In 2014 Hampshire announced the formation of a new concentration, in Psychoanalytic Studies. =Five College Consortium= Hampshire College is the youngest of the schools in the Five-College Consortium. The other schools are Amherst College, Mt. Holyoke College, Smith College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Students at each of the schools may take classes and borrow books at the other schools, generally without paying additional fees. They may use resources at the other schools, including internet access, dining halls, and so forth. The five colleges collectively offer over 5,300 courses, and the five libraries have over eight million books. The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) operates bus services between the schools and the greater Pioneer Valley area. There are two joint departments in the five-college consortium: Dance and Astronomy. Admissions Hampshire College stopped accepting SAT and ACT scores of applicants in 2014, in an attempt to be fair to minority and low-income applicants, and to focus assessment on data better correlated with college success and on a longer period of time rather than a single high-pressure test. As a result, it was dropped from the U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges Ranking. The next year, the college said this move decreased the quantity but increased the quality and diversity of applicants, eliminated the incentive to \\"game\\" the U.S. News & World Report ranking by admitting less- qualified students with higher numerical scores or encouraging unqualified students to apply.Results of Removing Standardized Test Scores from College Admissions Sustainability =The R.W. Kern Center= Opened on April 26, 2017, the R.W. Kern Center is the 17th Living Building in the world certified under the advanced green-building standard, the Living Building Challenge. The building cost $10.4 million made possible by private donations. It operates net-zero energy, water, and waste. The building is powered by solar panels on its roof, supplies its own drinking water by harvesting rainwater from its roof, manages its wastewater on site, and contains composting toilets. The Kern Center was built using materials from local sources without the use of any toxic \\"red list\\" materials; even materials such as duct tape were chosen carefully to comply with strict environmental standards. Currently, the Kern Center houses Admissions and financial aid offices as well as classrooms, student lounges, and a coffee shop. President Jonathan Lash stated that \\"[w]ith this building we have sought to reflect our values, in the inclusive design process, the design and materials, our construction practices, and our reporting about the building... [w]hy are buildings constructed any other way? In every way, the Kern Center was built to learn and teach.‚Äù = Climate Action Plan = The solar panel field at Hampshire College Hampshire College will soon become the first college in the United States to be 100% solar powered, a milestone for the college. They wait for permission to switch to full operation of its solar energy. The solar panel array is a part of the college's main goal - to be climate-neutral by 2020 according to their extensive Climate Action Plan developed in April 2012. They began construction in February 2015. Two witness tests were conducted in June 2017 and its final one conducted November 2017. Since June 2017, part of the solar array has been powering the college. The solar panels cover 19 acres consisting of 15,000 panels which will eventually produce 4.7 megawatts of power. Hampshire College contracted with SolarCity to install the panels. The college will save up to $8 million in electricity cost in 20 years and $400,000 yearly. The 4.7 megawatts of solar power avoids 3,000 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions per year, equivalent to 650 fewer cars on the road. Other solar sources on campus contribute to the primary solar array's power production: the Kern Center rooftop solar arrays, the CSA Barn, the president's house, and the Longworth Arts Center canopy. The president stated that \\"[t]his is the challenge that our students and every other student is going to face in the next 20 years, how to turn the US economy into a low-carbon economy ... and they're going to get the real firsthand experience of doing it. So that was reason number one.‚Äù The president has declared that switching to renewable energy is \\"just the right thing to do in an era of accelerating climate change.\\" He also noted this project will keep jobs local and avoid pipelines being built through people's communities to get power to our college.\\" In the next 20 years, the college plans to reduce 50% of current consumption of energy, another major goal stated in their Climate Action Plan. They plan to renovate the Robert Crown Center, Library, Cole Science Center, Franklin Patterson Hall, Merrill House, and Greenwich House. The plan is made possible by a $1 million gift. =Timeline of Sustainability Initiative= The Maple Sugar Shack Since 2011, Hampshire College has been involved in various projects to \\"transform its food systems, campus operations, curriculum and campus culture to embrace sustainability.\\" The college's advances in sustainability include various projects. In 2011, the college was the first in the world to divest from fossil-fuels. In 2012, they developed the Climate Action Plan for climate neutrality by 2022. Hampshire College Farm expanded their education and operation, establishing the Center for New England and Agriculture. In 2014 the main traffic circle and parking lot was eliminated and turned into a meadow. They also stopped mowing dozen acres of lawns in hopes of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, saving landscaping expenses and creating wildlife and plant habitats. In the same year, they installed an electric car-charging station behind the library. In 2015 they permanently protected 46 acres of their property through a conservation restriction. The Kern Center became their first 100% emission-free building in 2016 and the Hitchcock Center for the Environment built its new living building on Hampshire land. In 2017, Hampshire College pledged to continue to support climate action and reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement. They signed the We Are Still In campaign along with 2,600 total signers. Prominent campus issues =Re-Radicalization= In the spring of 2004, a student group calling itself Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College (Re-Rad) emerged with a manifesto called The Re-Making of a College, which critiqued what they saw as a betrayal of Hampshire's founding ideas in alternative education and student-centered learning. On May 3, 2004, the group staged a demonstration that packed the hall outside the President's office during an administrative meeting. Response from the community was generally amicable and Re-Rad made some progress. The Yurt is home to Hampshire's student Internet radio station The Re-Radicalization movement was responding in part to a new \\"First-Year Plan\\" that changed the structure of the first year of study. Beginning in the Fall of 2002, the requirements for passing Division I were changed so that first-year students no longer had to complete independent projects (see Curriculum above). Re-Rad submitted its own counter- proposal in both 2006 and 2007, but these proposals were not acted on, and no follow-up was attempted. The Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College assisted the administration in launching a pilot program known as mentored independent study. This program paired ten third semester students with Division III students with similar academic interests to complete a small study‚Äîobserved by, and subject to the approval of, a faculty member. While some students worry about what they see as Hampshire's headlong plunge into normality, the circumstances of Hampshire's founding tends to perennially attract students who revive the questions about education the institution was founded on, and who challenge the administration to honor the founding mission. Unsurprisingly, then, Re-Rad was not the first student push of its type. Similar efforts have sprung up at Hampshire with some regularity, with varying impacts. In 1996, student Chris Kawecki spearheaded a similar push called the Radical Departure, calling for a more holistic, organic integration of education into students' lives.The Experimental Program In Education and Community Peter Christopher Document Archive The most durable legacy of the Radical Departure was EPEC, a series of student-led non-credit courses. A more detailed account of movements such as these can be found in a history of Hampshire student activities, an account written by alumnus Timothy Shary (F86) that was commissioned by Community Council in 1990; he has subsequently been a faculty member at Clark University of Worcester, Massachusetts, and the University of Oklahoma.Timothy Shary , University of Oklahoma, Faculty of Film & Video Studies Faculty. Timothy Shary, Curriculum Vitae (MS Word) Note in the CV: Keynote Speech: Activating the History in Student Activities, delivered at Hampshire College History Day, Amherst, MA, April 29, 2000. In the media The Harold F. Johnson Library In May 1977, Hampshire was the first college in the nation to divest from apartheid South Africa.Volume 2, 1975‚Äì1985, Chapter 6: Divestment Hampshire College Archives The college removed $39,000 in stocks in four companies. Legal and financial research undertaken by student Michael Current and faculty member Kurtis Gordon was promoted nationally by business activists Douglas Tooley and Debbie Knight. In February 2009 it was reported that Hampshire College had divested from Israel because of its violation of human rights. However, under pressure from pro- Israel groups and high-profile individuals, most notably attorney Alan Dershowitz, the father of a Hampshire alumnus, Hampshire's president stated that the changes in investments were not politically motivated. Hampshire continues to display a statement from Dershowitz on its website, in which the lawyer withdraws his criticism and pledges his support, stating, \\"Hampshire has now done the right thing. It has made it unequivocally clear that it did not and will not divest from Israel. Indeed, it will continue to hold stock in companies that do business with Israel as well as with Israeli companies....\\" In November 2001, a controversial All-Community Vote at Hampshire declared the school opposed to the recently launched War on Terrorism, another national first that drew national media attention, including scathing reports from Fox News Channel and the New York Post (\\"Kooky College Condemns War\\"). Saturday Night Live had a regular sketch, \\"Jarret's Room\\", starring Jimmy Fallon, which takes place at Hampshire College but is inaccurate. It refers to non-existent buildings (\\"McGuinn Hall\\", which is actually the Sociology and Social Work building at fellow cast member Amy Poehler's alma mater, Boston College) and features yearbooks, tests, seniors, fraternities, three-person dorm rooms, and a football team‚Äînone of which the school has ever had. The sketch also claims that the college is actually in New Hampshire rather than Massachusetts. These characters would later be revived on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon during the COVID-19 pandemic. In another SNL episode aired on December 14, 2002, host Al Gore plays Dr. Ralph Wormly Curtis, a professor at Hampshire College. The same sketch implies that the band Phish attends Hampshire as well, though in reality all four members attended the University of Vermont. In Whit Stillman's comedy-drama film The Last Days of Disco, Chlo√´ Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale star as two recent Hampshire graduates in the late 1970's in the disco scene of New York City. Alumnus Ken Burns wrote of the college: \\"Hampshire College is a perfect American place. If we look back at the history of our country, the things we celebrate were outside of the mainstream. Much of the world operated under a tyrannical model, but Americans said, 'We will govern ourselves.' So, too, Hampshire asked, at its founding, the difficult questions of how we might educate ourselves... When I entered Hampshire, I found it to be the most exciting place on earth.\\" Loren Pope wrote of Hampshire in the college guide Colleges That Change Lives: \\"Today no college has students whose intellectual thyroids are more active or whose minds are more compassionately engaged.\\" =Flag removal= Following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, on November 9, 2016, Hampshire students lowered the American flag at the center of campus to half-staff as \\"a protest against acts of hate and harassment.\\" The next day, school officials announced they would allow the flag to remain at half-staff temporarily. College president Jonathan Lash said in a statement that some of the people on campus felt that the flag was \\"a powerful symbol of fear they've felt all their lives because they grew up in marginalized communities, never feeling safe.\\" In an incident under investigation by campus police, the flag was burned at some time in the evening of November 10 or the morning of November 11. It was replaced the following day and the school indicated it would continue to fly the flag at half-mast \\"to mourn deaths from violence in the U.S. and around the world.\\" Following a backlash, the college announced on November 21 that it would temporarily cease flying the flag on campus. This, in turn, led to protests including veterans for restoration of the flag, with sources claiming from 400 attendees to ‚Äúover a thousand.‚Äù Local state representative John Velis (D) called for the school to return the flag and expel the students who burned the flag: they should \\"pack up their bags and leave.\\" On November 29, shortly after Fox News aired a news segment on the incident, Trump tweeted \\"Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag‚Äîif they do, there must be consequences‚Äîperhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\\" On December 2, the school decided to raise the flag to full staff.

He was the drummer for the bands Split Enz and Crowded House. Early years Hester was the older of two children (his younger sister is Carolyn) from Melbourne, Australia born to a bushman father and jazz drummer mother. At an early age he was encouraged by his mother to play drums. His extrovert personality did not impress his teachers, and he left school early and attempted various jobs before starting a musical career. He spent most of his teen years living in the Dandenong Ranges, the family home being on the edge of Sherbrooke Forest at the Sherbrooke/Kallista boundary. Some of the Melbourne bands he played in from 1976 to 1978 included Thunder and Edges. In 1979 he co-founded a Melbourne-based band called Cheks (renamed Deckchairs Overboard when they moved to Sydney in 1982). He lived with Deborah Conway of Do-R√©-Mi during the early 1980s, while playing regularly in Love Party. Hester later worked with Conway in Rose Amongst Thorns (1990‚Äì1991) and Ultrasound (1995). Split Enz and Crowded House =Split Enz= At the departure of drummer Mal Green from Split Enz in 1981, their percussionist Noel Crombie took up the role of drummer. After the release of the Enz album Time and Tide in 1982, the band took a break to focus on other projects. According to the radio documentary Enzology, when they reformed in mid-1983, both Finn brothers returned somewhat distracted. Tim Finn had just released the very successful solo album Escapade, while younger brother Neil Finn had a child on the way. The reunion resulted in Conflicting Emotions (November 1983), an album which marked the beginning of the end for the band. Before the tour to support the album it was decided that Crombie would return to percussion (something he says he enjoyed more than drumming), and the band would find a new drummer. Hester was auditioned on the advice of Rob Hirst of Midnight Oil and got the job. In June 1984, founder Tim Finn left Split Enz, and they released See Ya 'Round in November which included \\"This is Massive\\" which was written by Hester. When Split Enz disbanded in December, Hester and Neil Finn decided to start a new group. =Crowded House= Initially, the new band formed by Hester and Neil Finn was named \\"The Mullanes\\" and then underwent a few name changes. They recruited Nick Seymour to play bass guitar and Craig Hooper on guitar, Hooper left as they secured a recording contract with Capitol Records in the US. However, Capitol disliked the name and the band changed to Crowded House to record their debut eponymous album, Crowded House in 1986. Other records by Crowded House with Hester are: Temple of Low Men (1988), Woodface (1991), Together Alone (1993), and the Best-of collection Recurring Dream (1996). By 1993 Hester was frustrated by the demands of his career and suffered a phobia about leaving to go on tour. On his return to Australia that year he started to see a psychiatrist.Paul Hester profile, smh.com.au, 28 March 2005; accessed 8 January 2016. He remained with Crowded House until 1994, when the pressure of touring and the birth of his first daughter made him want to stay home, rather than remain on the road. Hester left mid-way through a 1994 tour of America, forcing the band to recruit British drummer Peter Jones for the rest of the tour. Hester performed with Crowded House at the band's farewell concert on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House in 1996. After Crowded House Towards the end of his time with Crowded House, Paul produced The Holy Toledos' second album, \\"Blood\\", and played drums on its first single. It was on his recommendation the band was picked up by Sony. After leaving Crowded House, Hester appeared on many TV and radio shows in Australia and opened a cafe/restaurant named Beach House Cafe with fellow Melbourne musician Joe Camilleri in Elwood Beach in Melbourne. From 1995 until 1998, Hester appeared regularly on the popular Australian radio show Martin/Molloy. He played drums as a session musician for producer Richard Pleasance. One of his final recordings was Sophie Koh's debut album All the Pretty Boys. Hester also had a recurring role as \\"Paul the Cook\\" with the popular Australian children's music group, The Wiggles, including his appearance in their 1998 music video Fruit Salad (Yummy Yummy) taken from their 1998 Yummy Yummy video. =Largest Living Things= Hester later became involved in a new band called Largest Living Things (1997‚Äì2000), with Kevin Garant on guitar and Barry Stockley on bass, performing with members of rock groups Crowded House, Split Enz, Midnight Oil, and others. Largest Living Things released a few EPs in Australia featuring songs written and sung by Hester; in contrast to his previous work in Crowded House, Hester played guitar as well as drums. The Largest Living Things featured on Mick Molloy's controversial 1999 TV show The Mick Molloy Show, with Hester as bandleader. Hester formed Tarmac Adam with Crowded House's Nick Seymour and Matt O'Donnell, Sean McVitty and Steve Paix in 2001. =Hessie's Shed= In 1998, Hester hosted his own 10-part TV series Hessie's Shed on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).Hessie's Shed details, IMDb.com; accessed 8 January 2016. This show gave Hester the room to explore his humorous presenter skills, showcase some friends, reunite with friends from Crowded House, and play with the house band and his own band, Largest Living Things, with Hester now performing from behind the drums instead of guitar. =The MAX Sessions= Hester went on to host the intimate concerts The MAX Sessions. Broadcast on MAX, these intimate concerts, which were mainly recorded at the Sydney Opera House, featured a variety of local and international acts. A highlight of the show's concerts saw Hester reunite with former bandmates Neil Finn and Tim Finn for a few songs, backing them on drums, while they were promoting their album Everyone Is Here. Personal life Hester was in the a relationship with Deborah Conway from Do-Re-Mi in the early 1980s. He later formed a relationship with photographer Mardi Sommerfeld and they had two daughters Olive and Sunday. They lived in the suburb of Elwood in Melbourne, Victoria. Hester is quoted as having claimed that he had always lived \\"on pages 57 and 58 of the Melway\\", being the pages of the Melbourne street directory covering the St Kilda district. =Death= On 26 March 2005, aged 46, Hester committed suicide by hanging himself in Elsternwick Park near his home. Four years earlier he had split from Mardi Sommerfeld. His two daughters, Olive and Sunday, were aged 5 and 10 at the time of his death. It was known to family and close friends that he had been suffering from depression for a number of years, and was prone to extreme mood swings. Hester was buried at Blackwood in the Central Highlands region of Victoria. His life was commemorated at the 2005 Aria Awards, with Neil Finn singing the staple Crowded House anthem solo \\"Better Be Home Soon\\" along with a mini-biography and footage from his life and achievements. In October 2005, in memory of Hester and to acknowledge his long links with the area, the local Port Phillip Council agreed to name a path alongside the Elwood Canal, the Paul Hester Walk, after him. More recently, Hester Street in Officer was named after him. Hester's girlfriend at the time of his death was New Zealand-based singer Kashan Vincent. In July 2006, Vincent sued his estate, claiming a third of his net worth. Vincent claimed the pair had a relationship for 32 months and, while not cohabiting, were engaged, but had called off their wedding. By May 2007, the lawsuit was resolved out of court, with Vincent receiving a payout, and Hester's two daughters named as the sole beneficiaries of their father's estate.

Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch. 1959Bandle, Oskar. 2002. The Nordic languages: an international handbook of the history of the North Germanic languages. 2002. P.391 ) were a North Germanic tribe who inhabited Svealand (\\"land of the Swedes\\") in central Sweden and one of the progenitor groups of modern Swedes, along with Geats and Gutes. The first author who wrote about the tribe is Tacitus, who in his Germania, from 98 CE mentions the Suiones. They are possibly first mentioned locally by the Kylver Stone in the 4th century. Jordanes, in the 6th century, mentions Suehans and Suetidi. Beowulf mentions the Swedes around 1000 A.D. According to early sources such as the sagas, especially Heimskringla, the Swedes were a powerful tribe whose kings claimed descendence from the god Freyr. During the Viking Age they constituted the basis of the Varangian subset, the Norsemen that travelled eastwards (see Rus' people). The scholarly consensus https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/ is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal eastern Sweden around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as Roslagen in Sweden (with the older name being Roden).https://www.ancient.eu/Kievan_Rus/https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vikg/hd_vikg.htmhttps://www.timetraveltours.se/blog/swedish- vikings-and-the-eastern-world/ According to the prevalent theory, the name Rus, like the Proto-Finnic name for Sweden (*Ruotsi), is derived from an Old Norse term for \\"the men who row\\" (rods-) as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe, and that it could be linked to the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen (Rus-law) or Roden, as it was known in earlier times.Stefan Brink, 'Who were the Vikings?', in The Viking World, ed. by Stefan Brink and Neil Price (Abingdon: Routledge, 2008), pp. 4-10 (pp. 6-7). The name Rus would then have the same origin as the Finnish and Estonian names for Sweden: Ruotsi and Rootsi.\\"Russ, adj. and n.\\" OED Online, Oxford University Press, June 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/169069.

Swedes made up the bulk of the Varangian Guard, this can be seen from the geographical location of the Varangian Runestones, of which almost all are found entirely in modern-day Sweden.

Name As the dominions of the Swedish kings grew, the name of the tribe could be applied more generally during the Middle Ages to include also the Geats. Later it again meant only the people inhabiting the original tribal lands in Svealand, rather than the Geats. Piraeus Lion drawing of curved lindworm. The runes on the lion tell of Swedish warriors, most likely Varangians, mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor. In modern North Germanic languages, the adjectival form svensk and its plural svenskar have replaced the name svear and is, today, used to denote all the citizens of Sweden. The distinction between the tribal Swedes (svear) and modern Swedes (svenskar) appears to have been in effect by the early 20th century, when Nordisk familjebok noted that svenskar had almost replaced svear as a name for the Swedish people.The article Sverige, spr√•kv. in Nordisk familjebok Although this distinction is convention in modern Norwegian, Danish and Swedish, Icelandic and Faroese do not distinguish between sv√≠ar (Icelandic) or sviar (Faroese) and s√¶nskir (Icelandic) or svenskarar (Faroese) as words for modern Swedes.The recommendations of the Council for the Faroese Language on nationality words Etymology The form Suiones appears in the Roman author Tacitus's Germania. A closely similar form, Swƒìon, is found in Old English and in the Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum of Adam of Bremen about the Hamburg-Bremen archbishops who are denoted Sueones. Most scholars agree that Suiones and the attested Germanic forms of the name derive from the same Proto-Indo-European reflexive pronominal root, , as the Latin suus. The word must have meant \\"one's own (tribesmen)\\". In modern Scandinavian, the same root appears in words such as sv√•ger (brother-in-law) and sv√§gerska (sister-in-law). The same root and original meaning is found in the ethnonym of the Germanic tribe Suebi, preserved to this day in the name Schwaben (Swabia).Noreen, A. Nordens √§ldsta folk- och ortnamn (i Fornv√§nnen 1920 sid 32).Hellquist, Elof. 1922. Svensk etymologisk ordbok. Svear The details of the phonetic development vary between different proposals. Nor√©en (1920) proposed that Suiones is a Latin rendering of Proto-Germanic *Swihoniz, derived from the PIE root *swih- \\"one's own\\". The form *Swihoniz would in Ulfilas' Gothic become *Swa√≠hans, which later would result in the form Suehans that Jordanes mentioned as the name of the Swedes in Getica. Consequently, the Proto-Norse form would have been *Swehaniz which following the sound-changes in Old Norse resulted in Old West Norse Sv√≠ar and Old East Norse Swear. Currently, however, the root for \\"one's own\\" is reconstructed as rather than *swih, and that is the root identified for Suiones e.g. in Pokorny's 1959 Indogermanisches etymologisches W√∂rterbuch and in the 2002 The Nordic languages: an international handbook of the history of the North Germanic languages edited by Oskar Bandle. *Swe is also the form cited by V. Friesen (1915), who regards the form Sviones as being originally an adjective, Proto-Germanic *Sweoniz, meaning \\"kindred\\". Then the Gothic form would have been *Swians and the H in Suehans an epenthesis. The Proto-Norse form would then also have been *Sweoniz, which also would have resulted in the historically attested forms. Runestone DR 344 is one of the earliest surviving instances of the name Sv√≠√æj√≥√∞, in Scandinavia (only Runestone DR 216, Beowulf and probably also the Getica are earlier). The name became part of a compound, which in Old West Norse was Sv√≠√æj√≥√∞ (\\"the Svear people'\\", in Old East Norse Swe√æiu√∞ and in Old English Sweo√∞eod. This compound appears on runestones in the locatives i sui√æiu√æu (Runestone S√∂ Fv1948;289, Aspa L√∂t, S√∂dermanland), a sui√æiu√æu (Runestone DR 344, Simris, Scania) and o suo√æiau√æu (Runestone DR 216, Tirsted, Lolland). The 13th century Danish source Scriptores rerum danicarum mentions a place called litl√¶ swethiuth√¶, which is probably the islet Sverige (Sweden) in Saltsj√∂n in eastern Stockholm. 500 m west of the Islet Danmark.^ K√§llg√•rd, Anders (2005). Sveriges √∂ar. Carlssons bokf√∂rlag. sid. 359. The earliest instance, however, appears to be Suetidi in Jordanes' Getica (6th century). The only Germanic nation having a similar naming was the Goths, who from the name *Gutans (cf. Suehans) created the form gut-√æiuda. The name Swethiuth and its different forms gave rise to the different Latin names for Sweden, Suethia, Suetia and Suecia as well as the modern English name for the country. A second compound was Sv√≠ariki, or Sweorice in Old English, which meant \\"the realm of the Suiones\\". This is still the formal name for Sweden in Swedish, Svea rike and the origin of its current name Sverige with the \\"k\\" in the old form \\"Sverike\\" changed to a \\"g\\". Location Gamla Uppsala was the main religious and political centre of the tribe. Their primary dwellings were in eastern Svealand. Their territories also very early included the provinces of V√§stmanland, S√∂dermanland and N√§rke in the M√§laren Valley which constituted a bay with a multitude of islands. The region is still one of the most fertile and densely populated regions of Scandinavia. Their territories were called Svealand - \\"Swede-land\\" (\\"The Voyage of Ohthere\\" in Seven Books of History Against the Pagans: Sw√©oland), Suithiod - \\"Swede-people\\" (Beowulf: Sweo√∞eod [hence Sweden]), Sv√≠aveldi or Svearike - \\"Swede-realm\\" (Beowulf: Sw√©orice). The political unification with the Geats in G√∂taland, a process that was not complete until the 13th century, is by some contemporary historians regarded as the birth of the Swedish kingdom, although the Swedish kingdom is named after them, Sverige in Swedish, from Svea rike - i.e. the kingdom of the Suiones. The √Üsir-cult centre in Gamla Uppsala, was the religious centre of the Swedes and where the Swedish king served as a priest during the sacrifices (bl√≥ts). Uppsala was also the centre of the Uppsala √∂d, the network of royal estates that financed the Swedish king and his court until the 13th century. Some dispute whether the original domains of the Suiones really were in Uppsala, the heartland of Uppland, or if the term was used commonly for all tribes within Svealand, in the same way as old Norway's different provinces were collectively referred to as Nortmanni. History The history of this tribe is shrouded in the mists of time. Besides Norse mythology and Germanic legend, only a few sources describe them and there is very little information. =Romans= The Roman empire under Hadrian (ruled 117-38), showing the location of the Suiones Germanic tribe, inhabiting central Sweden Gaius Cornelius Tacitus There are two sources from the 1st century A.D that are quoted as referring to the Suiones. The first one is Pliny the Elder who said that the Romans had rounded the Cimbric peninsula (Jutland) where there was the Codanian Gulf (Kattegat?). In this gulf there were several large islands among which the most famous was Scatinavia (Scandinavia). He said that the size of the island was unknown but in a part of it dwelt a tribe named the Hillevionum gente (Nominative: Hillevionum gens), in 500 villages, and they considered their country to be a world of its own. What strikes the commentators of this text is that this large tribe is unknown to posterity, unless it was a simple misspelling or misreading of Illa Svionum gente. This would make sense, since a large Scandinavian tribe named the Suiones was known to the Romans. Tacitus wrote in AD 98 in Germania 44, 45 that the Suiones were a powerful tribe (distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets) with ships that had a prow in both ends). He further mentions that the Suiones were much impressed by wealth, and the king's thus was absolute. Further, the Suiones did not normally bear arms, and that the weapons were guarded by a slave. After Tacitus' mention of the Suiones, the sources are silent about them until the 6th century as Scandinavia still was in pre-historic times. Some historians have maintained that it is not possible to claim that a continuous Swedish ethnicity reaches back to the Suiones of Tacitus.Dick Harrison: Sveriges historia - Medeltiden (2002); Fredrik Svanberg: Decolonizing the Viking Age (2003). According to this view the referent of an ethnonym and the ethnic discourse have varied considerably during different phases of history. =Jordanes= Vendel Period helmet at the Swedish History Museum. In the 6th century Jordanes named two tribes he calls the Suehans and the Suetidi who lived in Scandza. They were famous for their fine horses. The Suehans were the suppliers of black fox skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names a tribe named Suetidi a name that is considered to refer to the Suiones as well and to be the Latin form of Swe√æiu√∞. The Suetidi are said to be the tallest of men together with the Dani who were of the same stock. =Anglo-Saxon sources= There are three Anglo-Saxon sources that refer to the Swedes. The earliest one is probably the least known, since the mention is found in a long list of names of tribes and clans. It is the poem Widsith from the 6th or the 7th century: {  :Wald Woingum, Wod √æyringum, :S√¶fer√∞ Sycgum, Sweom Ongend√æeow, :Sceafthere Ymbrum, Sceafa Longbeardum,  :Wald [ruled] the Woings, Wod the Thuringians, :Saeferth the Sycgs, Ongendtheow the Swedes, :Sceafthere the Umbers, Sceafa the Lombards,  } Vendel Period helmet at the Swedish History Museum. On line 32, Ongentheow is mentioned and he reappears in the later epic poem Beowulf, which was composed sometime in the 8th-11th centuries. The poem describes Swedish-Geatish wars, involving the Swedish kings Ongentheow, Ohthere, Onela and Eadgils who belonged to a royal dynasty called the Scylfings. These kings might have been historical as kings with similar names appear in Scandinavian sources as well (see list of legendary kings of Sweden). There appears to be a prophecy by Wiglaf in the end of the epic of new wars with the Swedes: {  :√û√¶t ys sio f√¶h√∞o and se feond-scipe, :w√¶l-ni√∞ wera, √æ√¶s √æe ic wen hafo, :√æe us secea√∞ to Sweona leode, :sy√∞√∞an hie gefricgea√∞ frean userne :ealdor-leasne, √æone √æe √¶r geheold :wi√∞ hettendum hord and rice, :√¶fter h√¶le√∞a hryre hwate Scylfingas, :folcred fremede o√∞√∞e fur√∞ur gen :eorl-scipe efnde.Lines 3000-3008.  :Such is the feud, the foeman's rage, :death-hate of men: so I deem it sure :that the Swedish folk will seek us home :for this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings, :when once they learn that our warrior leader :lifeless lies, who land and hoard :ever defended from all his foes, :furthered his folk's weal, finished his course :a hardy hero.Gummere's translation  } When more reliable historic sources appear the Geats are a subgroup of the Swedes. The third Anglo-Saxon source is Alfred the Great's translation of Orosius' Histories, with appended tales of the voyages of Ohthere of H√•logaland and Wulfstan of Hedeby, who in the 9th century described the Sweon and Sweoland. Ohthere's account is limited to the following statement about Swƒìoland: :√êonne is toƒìmnes √∞«£m lande s≈´√∞eweardum, on ≈ç√∞re healfe √∞√¶s m≈çres, Swƒìoland, o√∞ √∞√¶t land nor√∞eweard; and toƒìmnes √∞«£m lande nor√∞eweardum, Cwƒìna land.Excerpt presented by the University of Victoria :Then Sweden is along the land to the south, on the other side of the moors, as far as the land to the north; and (then) Finland (is) along the land to the north. Wulfstan only mentions a few regions as being subject to the Sweons (in translation): :Then, after the land of the Burgundians, we had on our left the lands that have been called from the earliest times Blekingey, and Meore, and Eowland, and Gotland, all which territory is subject to the Sweons; and Weonodland was all the way on our right, as far as Weissel- mouth.http://www.gutenberg.org =Frankish sources= The Annales Bertiniani relate that a group of Norsemen, who called themselves Rhos visited Constantinople around the year 838. Fearful of returning home via the steppes, which would leave them vulnerable to attacks by the Hungarians, the Rhos travelled through Germany. They were questioned by Louis the Pious, Emperor of Francia, somewhere near Mainz. They informed the emperor that their leader was known as chacanus (the Latin for \\"khagan\\") and that they lived in the north of Russia, but that they were Sueones. =Adam of Bremen= Dealing with Scandinavian affairs, Adam of Bremen relates in the 11th century Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum that the Sueones had many wives and were severe on crime. Hospitality was an important virtue and refusing a wanderer to stay over the night was considered shameful. The visitor was even taken to see the hosts' friends. Their royal family is of an old dynasty (see House of Muns√∂), but the kings are dependent on the will of the people (the Thing). What has been decided by the people is more important than the will of the king unless the king's opinion seems to be the most reasonable one, whereupon they usually obey. During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods (√Üsir) and if they win they are grateful to him. =Norse sagas= The sagas are our foremost source for knowledge, and especially Snorri Sturluson, who is probably the one who has contributed the most (see for instance the Heimskringla). His descriptions sometimes concur with, sometimes contradict the previous sources. For a continuation, see History of Sweden (800‚Äì1521).

It is the capital and largest city of the Rems-Murr district. As of 31 December 2018, Waiblingen had 55,449 inhabitants (27,334 men and 28,115 women). As of December 31, 2004, the area of the town (including all external properties, such as forests) was . History Waiblingen was first mentioned in Carolingian documents in 885 at the time of Charles the Fat. It received its town charter in 1250. Waiblingen was the property of the Salian kings, from whom the Hohenstaufen dukes and kings inherited it. It is intimately tied to the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in the 12th and 13th century. During the Siege of Weinsberg in 1140, the Hohenstaufens of Swabia (led by Conrad III of Germany) used \\"Wibellingen\\" - a version of the town name - as their rallying cry; \\"Wibellingen\\" subsequently became Ghibellino in Italian. The town was almost completely destroyed in 1634 during the Thirty Years' War, when Imperial and Spanish troops sacked the city after the Battle of N√∂rdlingen. Fires raged for more than a week, and most of Waiblingen's citizens were killed or had to flee. Rebuilding only began four years after this catastrophe; the existing old central part of the town dates back to the years between 1640 and 1700. Its fortifications are now well restored.

In the background are the southern Milky Way on the left and the Magellanic Clouds at the top. The Magellanic Clouds (or Nubeculae Magellani) are two irregular dwarf galaxies visible in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere; they are members of the Local Group and are orbiting the Milky Way galaxy. Because both show signs of a bar structure, they are often reclassified as Magellanic spiral galaxies. The two galaxies are: * Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), approximately 163,000 light-years away * Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), approximately 206,000 light years away  History  The Magellanic Clouds have been known since ancient times by indigenous people from South America and Africa, and from the first millennium in Western Asia. The first preserved mention of the Large Magellanic Clouds is believed to be in petroglyphs and rock drawings found in Chile. They may be the objects mentioned by the polymath Ibn Qutaybah (d. 889 CE), in his book on Al-AnwƒÅÃµ‚Äô (stations of the Moon in pre-Islamic Arabian culture): > \\"Ÿàÿ£ÿ≥ŸÅŸÑ ŸÖŸÜ ÿ≥ŸáŸäŸÑ ŸÇÿØŸÖÿß ÿ≥ŸáŸäŸÑ .

Under Argo Navis, he quoted that \\"unnamed others have claimed that beneath Canopus there are two stars known as the 'feet of Canopus', and beneath those there are bright white stars that are unseen in Iraq nor Najd, and that the inhabitants of Tihama call them al-Baqar [cows], and Ptolemy did not mention any of this so we [Al-Sufi] do not know if this is true or false.\\" Both Ibn Qutaybah and Al-Sufi were probably quoting from the former's contemporary (and compatriot) and famed scientist Abu Hanifa Dinawari's mostly lost work on Anwaa. Abu Hanifa was probably quoting earlier sources, which may be just travelers stories, and hence Al-Sufi's comments about their veracity. In Sri Lanka, from ancient times, these clouds have been referred to as the Maha Mera Paruwathaya meaning \\"the great mountain\\", as they look like the peaks of a distant mountain range. In Europe, the Clouds were first reported by 16th century Italian authors Peter Martyr d'Anghiera and Andrea Corsali, both based on Portuguese voyages.For Peter Martyr d'Anghiera's mention of the Magellanic clouds, see: * Petrus Martyr de Anghiera (1574) De rebus Oceanicis et Orbe Novo [Concerning the ocean and the new world] (Cologne, (Germany): Geruinum Calenium (Gerwin Calenius), 1574), decade 3, book 1, p. 217. (in Latin) From p. 217: \\"Assecuti sunt Portugallenses alterius poli gradum quintum & quinquagesimum amplius, ubi punctum, circumeuntes quasdam nubeculas licet intueri, veluti in lactea via sparsos fulgores per universum coeli globum intra eius spatii latitudinem.\\" (The Portuguese reached beyond the 55th degree of the other pole, where one may observe certain nebulae revolving around the point [i.e., the southern celestial pole], scattered in the Milky Way like luminous patches throughout the whole sphere of the sky, within the breadth of its extent. [That is, nebulae appear in or beside the Milky Way throughout its entire length in the southern sky.]) * Humboldt, Alexander von, with E.C. Otte and B.H. Paul, trans., Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe (London, England: Henry G.

In 1516, Andrea Corsali sent a letter to Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours, mentioning the Magellanic clouds. This letter was translated into English by Richard Eden (c.1520‚Äì1576) and published in 1555. The relevant part of Corsali's letter (translated by Eden) appears in: * Richard Eden, with Edward Arber, ed., The First Three English Books on America ‚Ä¶ (Birmingham, England: 1885), \\"Of the pole antarike and the starres abowt the same ‚Ä¶ \\", p. 279. Corsali said that his ship had passed the Cape of Good Hope (\\"the cape of Bona Speranza\\") and was at 37 degrees south latitude when he observed the Magellanic clouds: \\"Here we sawe a marueylous order of starres, so that in the parte of heauen contrary to owre northe pole, to know in what place and degree the south pole was, we tooke the day with the soonne, and obserued the nyght with the Astrolabie, and sawe manifestly twoo clowdes of reasonable bygnesse mouynge abowt the place of the pole continually now rysynge and nowe faulynge, so keepynge theyr continuall course in circular mouying, with a starre euer in the myddest which is turned abowt with them abowte xi degrees from the pole.\\" (\\"Here we saw a marvelous arrangement of stars, so that in the part of heaven [that is] opposite our north [celestial] pole, in order to know in what place and degree [of latitude] the south [celestial] pole was, we [measured our position during] the day using the sun, and observed [our position during] the night using an astrolabe, and saw clearly two clouds of reasonable bigness revolving around the location of the [southern celestial] pole, continually now rising and now falling, thus maintaining their continual course of circular motion, with a star always in the middle [between them], which revolves with them about 11 degrees from the [south celestial] pole.\\") * See also: Kanas, Nick, Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography, 2nd ed.

Subsequently, they were reported by Antonio Pigafetta, who accompanied the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan on its circumnavigation of the world in 1519‚Äì1522.Pigafetta et al., with Lord Stanley of Alderley, trans., The First Voyage Round the World, by Magellan (London, England: Hakluyt Society, 1874), p. 66. From p. 66: \\"The antarctic pole is not so covered with stars as the arctic, for there are to be seen there many small stars congregated together, which are like to two clouds a little separated from one another, and a little dimmed, ...\\" However, naming the clouds after Magellan did not become widespread until much later. In Bayer's Uranometria they are designated as nubecula major and nubecula minor.Bayer, J., (1661) Uranometria, pl. Aaa (49) U.S. Naval Observatory; retrieved on 2009-09-05 In the 1756 star map of the French astronomer Lacaille, they are designated as le Grand Nuage and le Petit Nuage (\\"the Large Cloud\\" and \\"the Small Cloud\\").de Lacaille, N. L., (1756) Planisphere contenant les Constellations Celestes, Memoires Academie Royale des Sciences pour 1752. Linda Hall Library; retrieved on 2009-09-05 Herschel in 1847 from Cape Observatory South Africa spent 4 years writing a 400-page report detailing over a thousand of the many stars, nebulae and clusters which constitute the cloud which appeared to be a separate more distant group to the usual stars in the Milky Way, an early indication of separate galaxy.  Characteristics  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The Large Magellanic Cloud and its neighbour and relative, the Small Magellanic Cloud, are conspicuous objects in the southern hemisphere, looking like separated pieces of the Milky Way to the naked eye. Roughly 21¬∞ apart in the night sky, the true distance between them is roughly 75,000 light-years. Until the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in 1994, they were the closest known galaxies to our own (since 2003, the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy was discovered to be closer still, and is now considered the actual nearest neighbor). The LMC lies about 160,000 light years away,Freedman, Wendy L.; Madore, Barry F. \\"The Hubble Constant\\", Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 2010Majaess, Daniel J.; Turner, David G.; Lane, David J.; Henden, Arne; Krajci, Tom \\"Anchoring the Universal Distance Scale via a Wesenheit Template\\", Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers, 2010 while the SMC is around 200,000. The LMC is about twice the diameter of the SMC (14,000 ly and 7,000 ly respectively). For comparison, the Milky Way is about 100,000 ly across. The total mass of these two galaxies is uncertain. Only a fraction of their gas seems to have coalesced into stars and they probably both have large dark matter halos. One recent estimate of the total mass of the LMC is about 1/10 that of the Milky Way. That would make the LMC rather a large galaxy in the current observable universe. Since the sizes of relatively nearby galaxies are highly skewed, the average mass can be a misleading statistic. In terms of rank, the LMC appears to be the fourth most massive member of over 50 galaxies in the local group. Suggesting that the Magellanic cloud system is historically not a part of the Milky Way is evidence that the SMC has been in orbit about the LMC for a very long time. The Magellanic system seems most similar to the distinct NGC 3109 system, which is on the edge of the Local Group. Astronomers have long assumed that the Magellanic Clouds have orbited the Milky Way at approximately their current distances, but evidence suggests that it is rare for them to come as close to the Milky Way as they are now. Observation and theoretical evidence suggest that the Magellanic Clouds have both been greatly distorted by tidal interaction with the Milky Way as they travel close to it. The LMC maintains a very clear spiral structure in radio-telescope images of neutral hydrogen. Streams of neutral hydrogen connect them to the Milky Way and to each other, and both resemble disrupted barred spiral galaxies. Their gravity has affected the Milky Way as well, distorting the outer parts of the galactic disk. Aside from their different structure and lower mass, they differ from our galaxy in two major ways. They are gas-rich; a higher fraction of their mass is hydrogen and helium compared to the Milky Way.http://home.insightbb.com/~lasweb/lessons/magellanic.htm Home.insightbb.com Retrieved on 2007-05-31 They are also more metal-poor than the Milky Way; the youngest stars in the LMC and SMC have a metallicity of 0.5 and 0.25 times solar, respectively.http://aa.springer.de/papers/8336003/2300925/sc6.htm Aa.springer.de Retrieved on 2007-05-31 Both are noted for their nebulae and young stellar populations, but as in our own galaxy their stars range from the very young to the very old, indicating a long stellar formation history.Chaisson and McMillan The Large Magellanic Cloud was host galaxy to a supernova (SN 1987A), the brightest observed in over four centuries. Measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope, announced in 2006, suggest the Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be long term companions of the Milky Way. If they are in orbit, that orbit takes at least 4 billion years. They are possibly on a first approach and we are witnessing the start of a galactic merger that may overlap with the Milky Way's expected merger with the Andromeda Galaxy (and perhaps the Triangulum Galaxy) in the future. In 2019, astronomers discovered the young star cluster Price-Whelan 1 using Gaia data. The star cluster has a low metallicity and belongs to the leading arm of the Magellanic Clouds. The existence of this star cluster suggests that the leading arm of the Magellanic Clouds is 90,000 light-years away from the Milky Way‚Äîcloser than previously thought.  Mini Magellanic Cloud (MMC)  Astrophysicists D. S. Mathewson, V. L. Ford and N. Visvanathan proposed that the SMC may in fact be split in two, with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the SMC (as seen from Earth's perspective), and separated by about 30,000 light years. They suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the LMC splitting the SMC, and that the two sections are still moving apart. They have dubbed this smaller remnant the Mini Magellanic Cloud. http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/122/1/220/200523.text.html The Astronomical Journal 122:220‚Äì231 July 2001 See also * Astronomical surveys of the Magellanic Clouds * Irregular galaxy * Magellanic Stream * Magellanic Bridge * Galaxies in fiction  References   Sources  * Eric Chaisson and Steve McMillan, Astronomy Today (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1993), p. 550\\\\. * Michael Zeilik, Conceptual Astronomy (New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1993), pp. 357‚Äì8.

Classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy, the SMC has a diameter of about 7,000 light-years, contains several hundred million stars, and has a total mass of approximately 7 billion solar masses.NASA ADS - The total mass and dark halo properties of the Small Magellanic Cloud The SMC contains a central bar structure, and astronomers speculate that it was once a barred spiral galaxy that was disrupted by the Milky Way to become somewhat irregular. At a distance of about 200,000 light-years, the SMC is among the nearest intergalactic neighbors of the Milky Way and is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye. The SMC is visible from the entire Southern Hemisphere, but can be fully glimpsed low above the southern horizon from latitudes south of about 15¬∞ north. The galaxy is located across both the constellations of Tucana and part of Hydrus, appearing as a faint hazy patch resembling a detached piece of the Milky Way. The SMC has an average apparent diameter of about 4.2¬∞ (8 times the Moon's) and thus covers an area of about 14 square degrees (70 times the Moon's). Since its surface brightness is very low, this deep-sky object is best seen on clear moonless nights and away from city lights. The SMC forms a pair with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which lies 20¬∞ to the east, and like the LMC, is a member of the Local Group and highly probably is a former satellite of the Large Magellanic Cloud and a current satellite of the Milky Way. Observation history Panoramic Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as seen from ESO's VLT observation site. The galaxies are on the left side of the image. In the southern hemisphere, the Magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants, including south sea islanders and indigenous Australians. Persian astronomer Al Sufi labelled the larger of the two clouds as Al Bakr, the White Ox. European sailors may have first noticed the clouds during the Middle Ages when they were used for navigation. Portuguese and Dutch sailors called them the Cape Clouds, a name that was retained for several centuries. During the circumnavigation of the Earth by Ferdinand Magellan in 1519-22, they were described by Antonio Pigafetta as dim clusters of stars. In Johann Bayer's celestial atlas Uranometria, published in 1603, he named the smaller cloud, Nubecula Minor. In Latin, Nubecula means a little cloud. Between 1834 and 1838, John Frederick William Herschel made observations of the southern skies with his reflector from the Royal Observatory. While observing the Nubecula Minor, he described it as a cloudy mass of light with an oval shape and a bright center. Within the area of this cloud he catalogued a concentration of 37 nebulae and clusters. In 1891, Harvard College Observatory opened an observing station at Arequipa in Peru. Between 1893 and 1906, under the direction of Solon Bailey, the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Henrietta Swan Leavitt, an astronomer at the Harvard College Observatory, used the plates from Arequipa to study the variations in relative luminosity of stars in the SMC. In 1908, the results of her study were published, which showed that a type of variable star called a \\"cluster variable\\", later called a Cepheid variable after the prototype star Delta Cephei, showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star's luminosity. This important period-luminosity relation allowed the distance to any other cepheid variable to be estimated in terms of the distance to the SMC. Hence, once the distance to the SMC was known with greater accuracy, Cepheid variables could be used as a standard candle for measuring the distances to other galaxies. Using this period-luminosity relation, in 1913 the distance to the SMC was first estimated by Ejnar Hertzsprung. First he measured thirteen nearby cepheid variables to find the absolute magnitude of a variable with a period of one day. By comparing this to the periodicity of the variables as measured by Leavitt, he was able to estimate a distance of 10,000 parsecs (30,000 light years) between the Sun and the SMC. This later proved to be a gross underestimate of the true distance, but it did demonstrate the potential usefulness of this technique. Announced in 2006, measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the Milky Way.  Features  VISTA‚Äôs view of the Small Magellanic Cloud. 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) is visible to the right of the Small Magellanic Cloud.alt= There is a bridge of gas connecting the Small Magellanic Cloud with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies. The Magellanic Clouds have a common envelope of neutral hydrogen indicating they have been gravitationally bound for a long time. This bridge of gas is a star-forming site. In 2017, using Dark Energy Survey plus MagLiteS data, a stellar over-density associated with the Small Magellanic Cloud was discovered, which is probably the result of interactions between SMC and LMC. X-ray sources The Small Magellanic Cloud contains a large and active population of X-ray binaries. Recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function. The young stellar population and the majority of the known X-ray binaries are concentrated in the SMC's Bar. HMXB pulsars are rotating neutron stars in binary systems with Be-type (spectral type 09-B2, luminosity classes V‚ÄìIII) or supergiant stellar companions. Most HMXBs are of the Be type which account for 70% in the Milky Way and 98% in the SMC.Coe et al. 2005 The Be-star equatorial disk provides a reservoir of matter that can be accreted onto the neutron star during periastron passage (most known systems have large orbital eccentricity) or during large-scale disk ejection episodes. This scenario leads to strings of X-ray outbursts with typical X-ray luminosities Lx = 1036‚Äì1037 erg/s, spaced at the orbital period, plus infrequent giant outbursts of greater duration and luminosity.Negueruela 1998 for a review Monitoring surveys of the SMC performed with NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Laycock et al. 2005; Galache et al. 2008 see X-ray pulsars in outburst at more than 1036 erg/s and have counted 50 by the end of 2008. The ROSAT and ASCA missions detected many faint X-ray point sources,Haberl & Sasaki 2000 but the typical positional uncertainties frequently made positive identification difficult. Recent studies using XMM- NewtonHaberl et al. 2008; Haberl & Pietsch 2004 and ChandraAntoniou et al. 2009; Edge et al. 2004, and Laycock et al. 2010 have now cataloged several hundred X-ray sources in the direction of the SMC, of which perhaps half are considered likely HMXBs, and the remainder a mix of foreground stars, and background AGN. No X-rays above background were observed from the Magellanic Clouds during the September 20, 1966, Nike-Tomahawk flight. Balloon observation from Mildura, Australia, on October 24, 1967, of the SMC set an upper limit of X-ray detection. An X-ray astronomy instrument was carried aboard a Thor missile launched from Johnston Atoll on September 24, 1970, at 12:54 UTC for altitudes above 300 km, to search for the Small Magellanic Cloud. The SMC was detected with an X-ray luminosity of 5 ergs/s in the range 1.5‚Äì12 keV, and 2.5 ergs/s in the range 5‚Äì50 keV for an apparently extended source. The fourth Uhuru catalog lists an early X-ray source within the constellation Tucana: 4U 0115-73 (3U 0115-73, 2A 0116-737, SMC X-1). Uhuru observed the SMC on January 1, 12, 13, 16, and 17, 1971, and detected one source located at 01149-7342, which was then designated SMC X-1. Some X-ray counts were also received on January 14, 15, 18, and 19, 1971. The third Ariel 5 catalog (3A) also contains this early X-ray source within Tucana: 3A 0116-736 (2A 0116-737, SMC X-1). The SMC X-1, a HMXRB, is at J2000 right ascension (RA) declination (Dec) . Two additional sources detected and listed in 3A include SMC X-2 at 3A 0042-738 and SMC X-3 at 3A 0049-726.

The destruction of proscribed weapons and the associated facilities was carried out mainly by Iraq, under constant supervision by UNSCOM.What Happened to Saddam's WMD? Arms Control Today September, 2003 Inspectors withdrew in 1998, and disbanded the following year amid allegations that the United States had used the commission's resources to spy on the Iraqi military.Chief U.N. weapons inspector rejects spying allegations CNN January 6, 1999US silence on new Iraq spying allegations BBC News January 7, 1999 Weapons inspector Scott Ritter later stated that Operation Rockingham had cherry-picked evidence found by the United Nations Special Commission; evidence, he says, that was later used as part of the casus belli for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The successor of the United Nations Special Commission was the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission. History =1990= The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was headed by Rolf Ek√©us and later Richard Butler. During several visits to Iraq by the United Nations Special Committee (UNSCOM), set up after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities, weapons inspectors were told by Rihab Rashid Taha that the al- Hakam germ warfare center was a chicken-feed plant. \\"There were a few things that were peculiar about this animal-feed production plant,\\" Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM's deputy executive chairman, later told reporters, \\"beginning with the extensive air defenses surrounding it.\\" =1991‚Äì1995= The powers given to UNSCOM inspectors in Iraq were: \\"unrestricted freedom of movement without advance notice in Iraq\\"; the \\"right to unimpeded access to any site or facility for the purpose of the on-site inspection...whether such site or facility be above or below ground\\"; \\"the right to request, receive, examine, and copy any record data, or information...relevant to\\" UNSCOM's activities; and the \\"right to take and analyze samples of any kind as well as to remove and export samples for off-site analysis\\".Black, Stephen, \\"UNSCOM and the Iraqi Biological Weapons Program: Implications for Arms Control\\", Politics and the Life Sciences, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Mar., 1999), pp. 62‚Äì63 Acceptance of the intrusion of the UNSCOM's inspectors on the part of the Iraqi regime was slow coming. But with the threat of punitive military action looming from the international community, and particularly the U.S., Saddam Hussein begrudgingly allowed UNSCOM's inspectors into the country to begin their work.Tripp, 250‚Äì251 From August 1991 the U.S. government made a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft available to UNSCOM. The imagery was analysed by U.S. analysts, but the volume of imagery exceeded analysis capacity. With UNSCOM authority, Scott Ritter and some other UNSCOM weapons inspectors also regularly took Lockheed U-2 imagery to Israel for analysis. Iraq protested about the supply of such information to Israel. Between 1991 and 1995, UN inspectors uncovered a massive program to develop biological and nuclear weapons. A large amount of equipment was confiscated and destroyed. Iraq by and large refused to cooperate with UNSCOM and its inspections as mandated by UN SC Res. 687 until June 1992, ten months after deadline, at which time the Iraqi government submitted \\"full, final and complete reports\\" on all of its weapons of mass destruction programs. These reports, however, were found to be incomplete and deficient, and at the same time UN inspectors were subjected to harassment and threats on the part of the Iraqi regime.Zilinskas, 230 United Nations Security Council Resolution 699 was also passed in 1991, declaring that Iraq was responsible for all funding of UNSCOM's inspections in Iraq. In 1995, UNSCOM's principal weapons inspector Dr. Rod Barton showed Taha documents obtained by UNSCOM from Israel that showed the Iraqi government had just purchased 10 tons of growth media from a British company called Oxoid. Growth media is a mixture of sugar, proteins and minerals that allows microscopic life to grow. It is used in hospitals, where swabs from patients are placed in dishes containing growth media for diagnostic purposes. Iraq's hospital consumption of growth media was just 200 kg a year; yet in 1988, Iraq imported 39 tons of it. Shown this evidence by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to inspectors that she had grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It was because of the discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material. UNSCOM learned that, in August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Taha's team was ordered to set up a program to weaponize the biological agents. By January 1991, a team of 100 scientists and support staff had filled 157 bombs and 16 missile warheads with botulin toxin, and 50 bombs and five missile warheads with anthrax. In an interview with the BBC, Taha denied the Iraqi government had weaponized the bacteria. \\"We never intended to use it,\\" she told journalist Jane Corbin of the BBC's Panorama program. \\"We never wanted to cause harm or damage to anybody.\\" UNSCOM found the munitions dumped in a river near al-Hakam. UNSCOM also discovered that Taha's team had conducted inhalation experiments on donkeys from England and on beagles from Germany. The inspectors seized photographs showing beagles having convulsions inside sealed containers. =1996= The al-Hakam germ warfare center, headed by the British-educated Iraqi biologist Dr. Rihab Rashid Taha, was blown up by UNSCOM in 1996. According to a 1999 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the normally mild-mannered Taha exploded into violent rages whenever UNSCOM questioned her about al-Hakam, shouting, screaming and, on one occasion, smashing a chair, while insisting that al-Hakam was a chicken-feed plant. Iraq charged that the commission was a cover for US espionage and refused UNSCOM access to certain sites, such as Baath Party headquarters. Although Ek√©us has said that he resisted attempts at such espionage, many allegations have since been made against the agency commission under Butler, charges which Butler has denied. Within the UN establishment in Iraq, UNSCOM was not without its critics, with the UN's humanitarian staff informally calling the inspectors 'UN-Scum'. In return, the UN's humanitarian staff were called \\"bunny-huggers\\". Also in 1996, the Iraqi ruling regime agreed to the terms of United Security Council Resolution 986, an oil-for-supplies agreement in which Iraq was allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months as a ways to purchase supplies for its increasingly impoverished and malnourished population. This agreement also allowed the UN to oversee the use and management of oil revenues, and to see that some of the funds went to pay war reparations and for the work of UNSCOM in Iraq during this period. The distribution of supplies purchased with oil revenues was also to be supervised by UN inspectors to ensure fair and equal distribution throughout the Iraqi population.Tripp, 252 =1998 Airstrikes= On the evening of 15 December 1998 the Security Council convened to consider two letters from weapons inspectors. The IAEA report by Mohamed El Baradei stated that Iraq \\"has provided the necessary level of cooperation to enable... [our] activities to be completed efficiently and effectively\\". The UNSCOM report, authored by Richard Butler, deplored the restrictions, lack of disclosure, and concealment. While conceding that \\"[i]n statistical terms, the majority of the inspections of facilities and sites under the ongoing monitoring system were carried out with Iraq's cooperation,\\" his letter listed a number of instances where unspecificed \\"undeclared dual-capable items\\" had been discovered, and where inspections had been held up so that buildings could be cleared of sensitive material. Since Operation Desert Fox had already begun at the time of the meeting (just hours after the inspectors had been evacuated), the Security Council debated about who was to blame for the military action, rather than whether they should authorize it. The Iraqi representative said: The Russian ambassador added: The view of the Council was split, with several countries placing the responsibility on Iraq. The United States declared that \\"Iraq's policy of unremitting defiance and non-compliance necessitated the resort to military force\\". The United Kingdom stated that the objectives of the action were \\"to degrade Iraq's capability to build and use weapons of mass destruction, and to diminish the military threat Iraq poses to its neighbours. The targets chosen, therefore, are targets connected with his military capability, his weapons of mass destruction and his ability to threaten his neighbours.\\" =1999: End of UNSCOM= In December 1999, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1284, replacing UNSCOM with the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, also known as UNMOVIC. Four countries ‚Äì among them Russia, France and China ‚Äì abstained from voting on Res. 1284, which led the Iraqi regime to reject the resolution because they saw the resolution as a way for the UN to claim Iraq as a \\"protectorate\\".Tripp, 269 UNSCOM's intention of identifying and eliminating Iraqi weapons programs resulted in numerous successes, illustrating the \\"value of a system approach to biological arms verification\\". But the overall effect of the UN sanctions on Iraqi in the 1990s had some negative effects on the Iraqi people.Black, 68 Graham-Brown (2000) and Halliday (1999) argued the sanctions caused malnutrition rates among Iraqis to increase and infant mortality rates to soar, exacting a heavy toll on ordinary Iraqi civilians not part of Saddam's patrimonial \\"shadow state\\".Graham-Brown, Sarah, \\"Sanctioning Iraq: A Failed Policy\\", Middle East Report, No. 215 (Summer, 2000), pp. 8‚Äì10Halliday, Denis J., \\"The Impact of the UN Sanctions on the People of Iraq\\", Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Winter, 1999), pp. 29‚Äì33 However, research by Dyson nd Cetorelli (2017) demonstrated that claims of a rise in infant mortality rates and malnutrition rates among Iraqi civilians due to sanctions were due to manipulation of a 1999 UNICEF survey by Saddam's regime, noting that comprehensive surveys after 2003 found no evidence that UN sanctions caused a rise in child mortality rates.Dyson, Tim; Cetorelli, Valeria (2017-07-01). \\"Changing views on child mortality and economic sanctions in Iraq: a history of lies, damned lies and statistics\\". BMJ Global Health. 2 (2): e000311. doi:10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000311. ISSN 2059-7908. PMC 5717930. . Allegations of CIA infiltration of UNSCOM Evidence that UNSCOM had been used by US intelligence to penetrate Iraqi security and track President Saddam Hussein's movements emerged in January 1999. An investigation by the Washington Post claimed that CIA engineers, working as UN technicians, installed equipment to spy on Iraqi sites without Butler's knowledge, and that this explained the unidentified \\"burst transmissions\\" that had been noted by the inspectors. Former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter later accused some UNSCOM personnel of spying, and also alleged that the purpose of the spying was to target Saddam in the bombing. Butler, on the other hand, denied allegations that foreign intelligence agencies \\"piggybacked\\" UNSCOM and questioned the factual accuracy of several of Ritter's statements.  Ritter on Iraq's WMDs after 1998  In June 1999, Ritter said: > When you ask the question, \\"Does Iraq possess militarily viable biological > or chemical weapons?\\" the answer is \\"NO!\\" It is a resounding \\"NO\\". Can Iraq > produce today chemical weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Can Iraq produce > biological weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Ballistic missiles? No! It is > \\"no\\" across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq has been > disarmed.

Just war theory (Latin: jus bellum justum) is a doctrine, also referred to as a tradition, of military ethics studied by military leaders, theologians, ethicists and policy makers. The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria, all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. The criteria are split into two groups: \\"right to go to war\\" (jus ad bellum) and \\"right conduct in war\\" (jus in bello). The first concerns the morality of going to war, and the second the moral conduct within war. Recently there have been calls for the inclusion of a third category of just war theory‚Äîjus post bellum‚Äîdealing with the morality of post- war settlement and reconstruction. Just war theory postulates that war, while terrible (but less so with the right conduct), is not always the worst option. Important responsibilities, undesirable outcomes, or preventable atrocities may justify war. Opponents of just war theory may be either inclined to a stricter pacifist standard (proposing that there has never been and/or can never be a justifiable basis for war) or toward a more permissive nationalist standard (proposing that a war need only serve a nation's interests to be justifiable). In many cases, philosophers state that individuals need not be of guilty conscience if required to fight. A few ennoble the virtues of the soldier while declaring their apprehensions for war itself. A few, such as Rousseau, argue for insurrection against oppressive rule. The historical aspect, or the \\"just war tradition\\", deals with the historical body of rules or agreements that have applied in various wars across the ages. The just war tradition also considers the writings of various philosophers and lawyers through history, and examines both their philosophical visions of war's ethical limits and whether their thoughts have contributed to the body of conventions that have evolved to guide war and warfare. Origins =Eastern= Ancient Egypt A 2017 study found that the just war tradition can be traced as far back as to Ancient Egypt, \\"demonstrating that just war thought developed beyond the boundaries of Europe and existed many centuries earlier than the advent of Christianity or even the emergence of Greco-Roman doctrine.\\" Confucian Chinese philosophy produced a massive body of work on warfare, much of it during the Zhou dynasty, especially the Warring States era. War was justified only as a last resort and only by the rightful sovereign; however, questioning the decision of the emperor concerning the necessity of a military action was not permissible. The success of a military campaign was sufficient proof that the campaign had been righteous. Though Japan did not develop its own doctrine of just war, between the 5th and 7th centuries they drew heavily from Chinese philosophy, and especially Confucian views. As part of the Japanese campaign to take the northeastern island Honshu, Japanese military action was portrayed as an effort to \\"pacify\\" the Emishi people who were likened to \\"bandits\\" and \\"wild- hearted wolf cubs\\" and accused of invading Japan's frontier lands. India The Indian Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, offers the first written discussions of a \\"just war\\" (dharma-yuddha or \\"righteous war\\"). In it, one of five ruling brothers (Pandavas) asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified. A long discussion then ensues between the siblings, establishing criteria like proportionality (chariots cannot attack cavalry, only other chariots; no attacking people in distress), just means (no poisoned or barbed arrows), just cause (no attacking out of rage), and fair treatment of captives and the wounded. The war in the Mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the \\"just cause\\" for the war including last minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war. At the beginning of the war, there is the discussion of \\"just conduct\\" appropriate to the context of war. In Sikhism, the term dharamyudh describes a war that is fought for just, righteous or religious reasons, especially in defence of one's own beliefs. Though some core tenets in the Sikh religion are understood to emphasise peace and nonviolence, especially before the 1606 execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal emperor Jahangir, military force may be justified if all peaceful means to settle a conflict have been exhausted, thus resulting in a dharamyudh. =Classical philosophy= It was Aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the Hellenic world where war was a last resort and required a conduct that would not make impossible the restoration of peace. Aristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war and warfare to \\"avoid becoming enslaved to others\\" is justified as self-defense. As an exception to this, Aristotelian just war theory permitted warfare to enslave what Aristotle called \\"natural slaves\\". For this reason, Aristotelian just war theory is not well regarded in present day. In Aristotelian philosophy, the abolition of what he considers \\"natural slavery\\" would undermine civic freedom. The pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over \\"those who deserve to be slaves\\". According to The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle's Politics the targets of this aggressive warfare were non-Greeks, noting Aristotle's view that \\"our poets say 'it is proper for Greeks to rule non-Greeks'\\".Marguerite Deslauriers, Pierre Destr√©e. The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle's Politics. pp. 157-162 In ancient Rome, a \\"just cause\\" for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion, or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty.Livy 9.1.10; Cicero, Divinatio in Caecilium 63; De provinciis consularibus 4; Ad Atticum VII 14, 3; IX 19, 1; Pro rege Deiotauro 13; De officiis I 36; Philippicae XI 37; XIII 35; De re publica II 31; III 35; Isidore of Seville, Origines XVIII 1, 2; Modestinus, Libro I regolarum = Digesta I 3, 40; E. Badian, Roman Imperialism in the Late Republic (Ithaca 1968, 2nd ed.), p.11. War was always potentially nefas (\\"wrong, forbidden\\"), and risked religious pollution and divine disfavor.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London 1925), pp. 33ff.; M. Kaser, Das altroemische Ius (Goettingen 1949), pp. 22ff; P. Catalano, Linee del sistema sovrannazionale romano (Torino 1965), pp. 14ff.; W. V. Harris, War and imperialism in Republican Rome, 327-70 B.C. (Oxford 1979), pp. 161 ff. A \\"just war\\" (bellum iustum) thus required a ritualized declaration by the fetial priests.Livy 1.32; 31.8.3; 36.3.9 More broadly, conventions of war and treaty-making were part of the ius gentium, the \\"law of nations\\", the customary moral obligations regarded as innate and universal to human beings.Cicero, De officiis 3.17.69; Marcia L. Colish, The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages (Brill, 1980), p. 150. The quintessential explanation of Just War theory in the ancient world is found in Cicero's De Officiis, Book 1, sections 1.11.33‚Äì1.13.41. Although, it is well known that Julius Caesar did not often follow these necessities. =Christian views= Christian theory of the Just War begins with Augustine of HippoChristians and War: Augustine of Hippo and the \\"Just War theory\\" and Thomas Aquinas.Christians and War: Thomas Aquinas refines the \\"Just War\\" Theory The Just War theory, with some amendments, is still used by Christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified. War may be necessary and right, even though it may not be good. In the case of a country that has been invaded by an occupying force, war may be the only way to restore justice. Saint Augustine Saint Augustine held that, while individuals should not resort immediately to violence, God has given the sword to government for good reason (based upon Romans 13:4). In Contra Faustum Manichaeum book 22 sections 69‚Äì76, Augustine argues that Christians, as part of a government, need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when forced to do so by a government. Augustine asserted that this was a personal, philosophical stance: \\"What is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart.\\" Nonetheless, he asserted, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority: > They who have waged war in obedience to the divine command, or in conformity > with His laws, have represented in their persons the public justice or the > wisdom of government, and in this capacity have put to death wicked men; > such persons have by no means violated the commandment, \\"Thou shalt not > kill.\\" While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work The City of God: > But, say they, the wise man will wage Just Wars. As if he would not all the > rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is a man; > for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be > delivered from all wars. J. Mark Mattox writes that, for the individual Christian under the rule of a government engaged in an immoral war, Augustine admonished that Christians, \\"by divine edict, have no choice but to subject themselves to their political masters and [should] seek to ensure that they execute their war-fighting duty as justly as possible.\\"Augustine: Political and Social Philosophy, ¬ß3-c \\"War and Peace ‚Äì The Just War\\" Saint Thomas Aquinas The just war theory by Thomas Aquinas has had a lasting impact on later generations of thinkers and was part of an emerging consensus in Medieval Europe on just war. In the 13th century Aquinas reflected in detail on peace and war. Aquinas was a Dominican friar and contemplated the teachings of the Bible on peace and war in combination with ideas from Aristotle, Plato, Saint Augustine and other philosophers whose writings are part of the Western canon. Aquinas' views on war drew heavily on the Decretum Gratiani, a book the Italian monk Gratian had compiled with passages from the Bible. After its publication in the 12th century, the Decretum Gratiani had been republished with commentary from Pope Innocent IV and the Dominican friar Raymond of Penafort. Other significant influences on Aquinas just war theory were Alexander of Hales and Henry of Segusio. In Summa Theologica Aquinas asserted that it is not always a sin to wage war and set out criteria for a just war. According to Aquinas, three requirements must be met: First, the war must be waged upon the command of a rightful sovereign. Second, the war needs to be waged for just cause, on account of some wrong the attacked have committed. Thirdly, warriors must have the right intent, namely to promote good and to avoid evil. Aquinas came to the conclusion that a just war could be offensive and that injustice should not be tolerated so as to avoid war. Nevertheless, Aquinas argued that violence must only be used as a last resort. On the battlefield, violence was only justified to the extent it was necessary. Soldiers needed to avoid cruelty and a just war was limited by the conduct of just combatants. Aquinas argued that it was only in the pursuit of justice, that the good intention of a moral act could justify negative consequences, including the killing of the innocent during a war. School of Salamanca The School of Salamanca expanded on Thomistic understanding of natural law and just war. It stated that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind. The School's adherents reasoned that war should be a last resort, and only then, when necessary to prevent an even greater evil. Diplomatic resolution is always preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. Examples of \\"just war\\" are: * In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. * Preventive war against a tyrant who is about to attack. * War to punish a guilty enemy. A war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements: * It is necessary that the response be commensurate with the evil; use of more violence than is strictly necessary would constitute an unjust war. * Governing authorities declare war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the people oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war. * Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages. * It is obligatory to take advantage of all options for dialogue and negotiations before undertaking a war; war is only legitimate as a last resort. Under this doctrine expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert infidels or pagans, and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.  First World War  In the early part of the First World War, a group of theologians in Germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the German government. At the British government's request Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders, including some with whom he had differed in the past, to write a rebuttal of the Germans' contentions. Both German and British theologians based themselves on the Just War theory, each group seeking to prove that it applied to the war waged by their own side.Mews, Stuart. \\"Davidson, Randall Thomas, Baron Davidson of Lambeth (1848‚Äì1930), Archbishop of Canterbury\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2011. Contemporary Catholic doctrine The just war doctrine of the Catholic Church found in the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church, in paragraph 2309, lists four strict conditions for \\"legitimate defense by military force\\": * the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain; * all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective; * there must be serious prospects of success; * the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated (the power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition). The Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church elaborates on the Just War Doctrine in paragraphs 500 to 501: :If this responsibility justifies the possession of sufficient means to exercise this right to defence, States still have the obligation to do everything possible \\"to ensure that the conditions of peace exist, not only within their own territory but throughout the world\\". It is important to remember that \\"it is one thing to wage a war of self- defence; it is quite another to seek to impose domination on another nation. The possession of war potential does not justify the use of force for political or military objectives. Nor does the mere fact that war has unfortunately broken out mean that all is fair between the warring parties\\". :The Charter of the United Nations intends to preserve future generations from war with a prohibition against force to resolve disputes between States. Like most philosophy, it permits legitimate defence and measures to maintain peace. In every case, the charter requires that self-defence must respect the traditional limits of necessity and proportionality. :Therefore, engaging in a preventive war without clear proof that an attack is imminent cannot fail to raise serious moral and juridical questions. International legitimacy for the use of armed force, on the basis of rigorous assessment and with well-founded motivations, can only be given by the decision of a competent body that identifies specific situations as threats to peace and authorizes an intrusion into the sphere of autonomy usually reserved to a State. Pope John Paul II in an address to a group of soldiers said the following: Russian Orthodox Church and the Just War The War and Peace section in the Basis of the Social Concept of the Russian Orthodox Church is crucial for understanding the Russian Orthodox Church‚Äôs attitude towards war. The document offers criteria of distinguishing between an aggressive war, which is unacceptable, and a justified war, attributing the highest moral and sacred value of military acts of bravery to a true believer who participates in a ‚Äújustified‚Äù war. Additionally, the document considers the just war criteria as developed in Western Christianity eligible for Russian Orthodoxy, so the ‚Äújustified war‚Äù idea in Western theology is applicable to the Russian Orthodox Church too. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In the same document is stated to wars have accompanied human history since the fall and, according to the Gospel, will continue to accompany it. While recognizing war as evil, the Russian Orthodox Church does not prohibit her members from participating in hostilities if at stake is the security of their neighbors and the restoration of trampled justice. Then war is considered to be necessary, though undesirable, but means. Also, it is stated to Orthodoxy has had profound respect for soldiers who gave their lives to protect the life and security of their neighbors. =The just war tradition= The just war theory by the Medieval Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas was developed further by legal scholars in the context of international law. Cardinal Cajetan, the jurist Francisco de Vitoria, the two Jesuit priests Luis de Molina and Francisco Su√°rez, as well as the humanist Hugo Grotius and the lawyer Luigi Taparelli were most influential in the formation of a just war tradition. This just war tradition was well established by the 19th century and found its practical application in the Hague Peace Conferences and the founding of the League of Nations in 1920. After the United States Congress declared war on Germany in 1917, Cardinal James Gibbons issued a letter that all Catholics were to support the war because \\"Our Lord Jesus Christ does not stand for peace at any price... If by Pacifism is meant the teaching that the use of force is never justifiable, then, however well meant, it is mistaken, and it is hurtful to the life of our country.\\" Armed conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the Cold War were, as a matter of course, judged according to the norms that Aquinas' just war theory had established by philosophers such as Jacques Maritain, Elizabeth Anscombe and John Finnis. The first work dedicated specifically to just war was De bellis justis of Stanis≈Çaw of Skarbimierz (1360‚Äì1431), who justified war by the Kingdom of Poland with Teutonic Knights. Francisco de Vitoria criticized the conquest of America by the Kingdom of Spain on the basis of just war theory. With Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius just war theory was replaced by international law theory, codified as a set of rules, which today still encompass the points commonly debated, with some modifications.Gutman R, Rieff D. Crimes of War: What the Public Should Know. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Company; 1999 The importance of the theory of just war faded with the revival of classical republicanism beginning with works of Thomas Hobbes. Just war theorists combine a moral abhorrence towards war with a readiness to accept that war may sometimes be necessary. The criteria of the just war tradition act as an aid to determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible. Just war theories are attempts \\"to distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable uses of organized armed forces\\"; they attempt \\"to conceive of how the use of arms might be restrained, made more humane, and ultimately directed towards the aim of establishing lasting peace and justice\\". Although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is relativistic, one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the Ethic of Reciprocity, particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle. If one set of combatants promise to treat their enemies with a modicum of restraint and respect, then the hope is that other sets of combatants will do similarly in reciprocation (a concept not unrelated to the considerations of Game Theory). The just war tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts: when it is right to resort to armed force (the concern of jus ad bellum) and what is acceptable in using such force (the concern of jus in bello). In more recent years, a third category‚Äîjus post bellum‚Äîhas been added, which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements, as well as the prosecution of war criminals. Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin defined only three types of just war, all of which share the central trait of being revolutionary in character. In simple terms: \\"To the Russian workers has fallen the honour and the good fortune of being the first to start the revolution‚Äîthe great and only legitimate and just war, the war of the oppressed against the oppressors.\\", with these two opposing categories being defined in terms of class, as is typical in the left. In that manner, Lenin shunned the more common interpretation of a defensive war as a just one‚Äîoften summarized as \\"who fired the first shot?\\"‚Äîprecisely because it didn't take in consideration the class factor. Which side initiated aggressions or had a grievance or any other commonly considered factor of jus ad bellum mattered not at all, he claimed; if one side was being oppressed by the other, the war against the oppressor would always be, by definition, a defensive war anyway. Any war lacking this duality of oppressed and oppressor was, in contradistinction, always a reactionary, unjust war, in which the oppressed effectively fight in order to protect their own oppressors: > \\"But picture to yourselves a slave-owner who owned 100 slaves warring > against a slave-owner who owned 200 slaves for a more \\"just\\" distribution of > slaves. Clearly, the application of the term \\"defensive\\" war, or war \\"for > the defence of the fatherland\\" in such a case would be historically false, > and in practice would be sheer deception of the common people, of > philistines, of ignorant people, by the astute slaveowners. Precisely in > this way are the present-day imperialist bourgeoisie deceiving the peoples > by means of \\"national ideology\\" and the term \\"defence of the fatherland\\" in > the present war between slave-owners for fortifying and strengthening > slavery.\\" Anarcho-capitalist scholar Murray Rothbard stated: \\"a just war exists when a people tries to ward off the threat of coercive domination by another people, or to overthrow an already-existing domination. A war is unjust, on the other hand, when a people try to impose domination on another people, or try to retain an already existing coercive rule over them.\\" Jonathan Riley-Smith writes, > The consensus among Christians on the use of violence has changed radically > since the crusades were fought. The just war theory prevailing for most of > the last two centuries‚Äîthat violence is an evil that can, in certain > situations, be condoned as the lesser of evils‚Äîis relatively young. Although > it has inherited some elements (the criteria of legitimate authority, just > cause, right intention) from the older war theory that first evolved around > AD 400, it has rejected two premises that underpinned all medieval just > wars, including crusades: first, that violence could be employed on behalf > of Christ's intentions for mankind and could even be directly authorized by > him; and second, that it was a morally neutral force that drew whatever > ethical coloring it had from the intentions of the perpetrators. Criteria Just War Theory has two sets of criteria, the first establishing jus ad bellum (the right to go to war), and the second establishing jus in bello (right conduct within war). =Jus ad bellum= ;Just cause: The reason for going to war needs to be just and cannot therefore be solely for recapturing things taken or punishing people who have done wrong; innocent life must be in imminent danger and intervention must be to protect life. A contemporary view of just cause was expressed in 1993 when the US Catholic Conference said: \\"Force may be used only to correct a grave, public evil, i.e., aggression or massive violation of the basic human rights of whole populations.\\" ;Comparative justice: While there may be rights and wrongs on all sides of a conflict, to overcome the presumption against the use of force, the injustice suffered by one party must significantly outweigh that suffered by the other. Some theorists such as Brian Orend omit this term, seeing it as fertile ground for exploitation by bellicose regimes. ;Competent authority: Only duly constituted public authorities may wage war. \\"A just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice. Dictatorships (e.g. Hitler's Regime) or deceptive military actions (e.g. the 1968 US bombing of Cambodia) are typically considered as violations of this criterion. The importance of this condition is key. Plainly, we cannot have a genuine process of judging a just war within a system that represses the process of genuine justice. A just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice\\". ;Right intention: Force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose‚Äîcorrecting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention, while material gain or maintaining economies is not. ;Probability of success: Arms may not be used in a futile cause or in a case where disproportionate measures are required to achieve success; ;Last resort: Force may be used only after all peaceful and viable alternatives have been seriously tried and exhausted or are clearly not practical. It may be clear that the other side is using negotiations as a delaying tactic and will not make meaningful concessions. ;Proportionality: The anticipated benefits of waging a war must be proportionate to its expected evils or harms. This principle is also known as the principle of macro-proportionality, so as to distinguish it from the jus in bello principle of proportionality. In modern terms, just war is waged in terms of self-defense, or in defense of another (with sufficient evidence). =Jus in bello= Once war has begun, just war theory (jus in bello) also directs how combatants are to act or should act: ;Distinction: Just war conduct should be governed by the principle of distinction. The acts of war should be directed towards enemy combatants, and not towards non-combatants caught in circumstances they did not create. The prohibited acts include bombing civilian residential areas that include no legitimate military targets, committing acts of terrorism or reprisal against civilians or prisoners of war (POWs), and attacking neutral targets. Moreover, combatants are not permitted to attack enemy combatants who have surrendered or who have been captured or who are injured and not presenting an immediate lethal threat or who are parachuting from disabled aircraft and are not airborne forces or who are shipwrecked. ;Proportionality: Just war conduct should be governed by the principle of proportionality. Combatants must make sure that the harm caused to civilians or civilian property is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by an attack on a legitimate military objective. This principle is meant to discern the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act. ;Military necessity: Just war conduct should be governed by the principle of military necessity. An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a legitimate military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. This principle is meant to limit excessive and unnecessary death and destruction. ;Fair treatment of prisoners of war: Enemy combatants who surrendered or who are captured no longer pose a threat. It is therefore wrong to torture them or otherwise mistreat them. ;No means malum in se: Combatants may not use weapons or other methods of warfare that are considered evil, such as mass rape, forcing enemy combatants to fight against their own side or using weapons whose effects cannot be controlled (e.g., nuclear/biological weapons). =Ending a war: Jus post bellum= In recent years, some theorists, such as Gary Bass, Louis Iasiello and Brian Orend, have proposed a third category within Just War theory. Jus post bellum concerns justice after a war, including peace treaties, reconstruction, environmental remediation, war crimes trials, and war reparations. Jus post bellum has been added to deal with the fact that some hostile actions may take place outside a traditional battlefield. Jus post bellum governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements, as well as the prosecution of war criminals, and publicly labeled terrorists. This idea has largely been added to help decide what to do if there are prisoners that have been taken during battle. It is, through government labeling and public opinion, that people use jus post bellum to justify the pursuit of labeled terrorist for the safety of the government's state in a modern context. The actual fault lies with the aggressor, so by being the aggressor they forfeit their rights for honorable treatment by their actions. This is the theory used to justify the actions taken by anyone fighting in a war to treat prisoners outside of war. Actions after a conflict can be warranted by actions observed during war, meaning that there can be justification to meet violence with violence even after war. Orend, who was one of the theorist mentioned earlier, proposes the following principles: ;Just cause for termination:A state may terminate a war if there has been a reasonable vindication of the rights that were violated in the first place, and if the aggressor is willing to negotiate the terms of surrender. These terms of surrender include a formal apology, compensations, war crimes trials and perhaps rehabilitation. Alternatively, a state may end a war if it becomes clear that any just goals of the war cannot be reached at all or cannot be reached without using excessive force. ;Right intention:A state must only terminate a war under the conditions agreed upon in the above criteria. Revenge is not permitted. The victor state must also be willing to apply the same level of objectivity and investigation into any war crimes its armed forces may have committed. ;Public declaration and authority:The terms of peace must be made by a legitimate authority, and the terms must be accepted by a legitimate authority. ;Discrimination:The victor state is to differentiate between political and military leaders, and combatants and civilians. Punitive measures are to be limited to those directly responsible for the conflict. Truth and reconciliation may sometimes be more important than punishing war crimes. ;Proportionality:Any terms of surrender must be proportional to the rights that were initially violated. Draconian measures, absolutionist crusades and any attempt at denying the surrendered country the right to participate in the world community are not permitted. Alternative theories * Militarism ‚Äì Militarism is the belief that war is not inherently bad but can be a beneficial aspect of society. * Realism ‚Äì The core proposition of realism is a skepticism as to whether moral concepts such as justice can be applied to the conduct of international affairs. Proponents of realism believe that moral concepts should never prescribe, nor circumscribe, a state's behaviour. Instead, a state should place an emphasis on state security and self-interest. One form of realism ‚Äì descriptive realism ‚Äì proposes that states cannot act morally, while another form ‚Äì prescriptive realism ‚Äì argues that the motivating factor for a state is self-interest. Just wars that violate Just Wars principles effectively constitute a branch of realism. * Revolution and civil war ‚Äì Just war theory states that a just war must have just authority. To the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government, this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war, in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of just war theory. This is less of a problem if the \\"just authority\\" is widely interpreted as \\"the will of the people\\" or similar. Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions side-steps this issue by stating that if one of the parties to a civil war is a High Contracting Party (in practice, the state recognised by the international community), both Parties to the conflict are bound \\"as a minimum, the following [humanitarian] provisions\\". Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention also makes clear that the treatment of prisoners of war is binding on both parties even when captured soldiers have an \\"allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power\\". * Absolutism ‚Äì Absolutism holds that there are various ethical rules that are absolute. Breaking such moral rules is never legitimate and therefore is always unjustifiable. * Right of self-defence ‚Äì The theory of self-defence based on rational self-interest maintains that the use of retaliatory force is justified against repressive nations that break the non- aggression principle. In addition, if a free country is itself subject to foreign aggression, it is morally imperative for that nation to defend itself and its citizens by whatever means necessary. Thus, any means to achieve a swift and complete victory over the enemy is imperative. This view is prominently held by Objectivists.\\"'Just War Theory'\\" vs. American Self-Defence , by Yaron Brook and Alex Epstein * Pacifism ‚Äì Pacifism is the belief that war of any kind is morally unacceptable and/or pragmatically not worth the cost. Pacifists extend humanitarian concern not just to enemy civilians but also to combatants, especially conscripts. For example, Ben Salmon believed all war to be unjust. He was sentenced to death during World War I (later commuted to 25 years hard labor) for desertion and spreading propaganda. * Consequentialism ‚Äì The moral theory most frequently summarized in the words \\"the end justifies the means\\", which tends to support the just war theory (unless the just war causes less beneficial means to become necessary, which further requires worst actions for self-defense with bad consequences). List of just war theorists These theorists either approve of war as retaliation, or of war as a last resort. * Cicero (106‚Äì43 BC) * St. Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430) * Gratian (Christian) (12th century) * Alexander of Hales (1185‚Äì1245)Russell, Frederick H. ‚ÄúJust War‚Äù in The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy, edited by Robert Pasnau and Christina Van Dyke.

It focused on current events and controversial issues. The show began broadcasting in November 1991. It was hosted by Neal Conan from late 2001 to June 27, 2013, the program's last day on air. Each episode featured guests discussing current affairs. Past regular hosts have included John Hockenberry, Ray Suarez, and Juan Williams. On Fridays Ira Flatow hosted Science Friday, with discussion topics from science and technology. The program invited listeners to pose questions for the guest host or hosts by telephone or e-mail. On March 29, 2013, NPR announced that it would cease production of TOTN at the end of June, replacing it with an expanded version of Here and Now, an NPR/WBUR co-production. Science Friday continued as an independent show. Format TOTN began with a look ahead to the upcoming topics. Then the regular five-minute NPR newscast occurred. After the newscast, the show generally spent from 30 minutes to the entire show discussing the main topic. If discussion on that topic petered, or if the guests had to leave, then shorter news interviews similar to those found on the NPR news-magazines of five to ten minutes aired. Sometimes these shorter segments took calls, but often they did not. More controversial issues may have had guests and take calls the entire hour. One hour's topics did not carry into the next hour. This is because many stations carried only one hour of the program. In addition, the host delivered a concluding \\"This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News\\" as a cue to stations that wish to cut away to local programming before the scheduled break. To coordinate the choice of interviewees across all NPR programs such as Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Tell Me More, NPR set up a \\"dibs list\\" system around 2005, whereby the first show to declare interest in a particular guest can \\"reserve\\" that person. Hosts Hosts included John Hockenberry (1991-1992), Ray Suarez (1993-1999), Juan Williams (2000-2001), and Neal Conan (2001-2013). Ira Flatow served as host of Science Friday since 1991. Guest hosts on the show included: Alison Stewart, Ira Glass, Mary Louise Kelly, John Donvan, and Tony Cox. From 2001 to 2013, TOTN had only two executive producers: Leith Bishop, and more recently, Sue Goodwin. Audience In September 2010, Talk of the Nation was aired on 328 public radio stations, and had a weekly audience of 3.2 million and an AQH Share of 605,700. As of March 2013, TOTN was airing on 407 stations to what host Neal Conan was \\"the largest audience in the program's history\\". In the final segment of the show's final episode, Conan noted the program had an audience of \\"more than 3.6 million ... each week. That puts Talk of the Nation in the top 10 of all talk shows in the country.\\" Cancellation On March 29, 2013, NPR and WBUR announced that Talk of the Nation would cease production and that NPR would replace it with a two-hour version of Here and Now. According to NPR executives, \\"the unusual move ... to replace Talk of the Nation with WBUR's Here & Now, which is carried by not even half as many stations across the country, is partly in response to long-voiced demands by member stations calling for more robust news coverage during the workday. The number of public radio listeners sags markedly between Morning Edition and All Things Considered.\\" Partnering with WBUR to expand Here and Now is considered a \\"more pragmatic approach to expanding [mid-day] news coverage\\" than Day to Day (2003-2009), an earlier NPR attempt at such a program, which had been produced in collaboration with Slate. The final broadcast of the program was on June 27, 2013.Final Talk Of The Nation Airs Thursday June 27, 2013. Retrieved June 27, 2013.

Verges are known by dozens of other names, often quite regional; see Terminology, below. The land is often public property, with maintenance usually being a municipal responsibility. Some municipal authorities, however, require that abutting property owners maintain their respective verge areas, as well as the adjunct footpaths or sidewalks. Benefits include visual aesthetics, increased safety and comfort of sidewalk users, protection from spray from passing vehicles, and a space for benches, bus shelters, street lights, and other public amenities. Verges are also often part of sustainability for water conservation or the management of urban runoff and water pollution and can provide useful wildlife habitat. Snow that has been ploughed off the street in colder climates often is stored in the area of the verge by default. In the British Isles, verges are the last location of habitats for a range of flora. Protection of roadside verge in Northumberland UK The main disadvantage of a road verge is that the right-of- way must be wider, increasing the cost of the road. In some localities, a wider verge offers opportunity for later road widening, should the traffic usage of a road demand this. For this reason, footpaths are usually sited a significant distance from the curb. Terminology The term verge has many synonyms and dialectal differences. Some dialects and idiolects lack a specific term for this area, instead using a circumlocution. Terms used include: * Berm: Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Zealand * Besidewalk * Boulevard: Detroit, Michigan; North Dakota; Minnesota; Iowa; Illinois; Ohio; Wisconsin; United States Upper Midwest; Winnipeg, and western Canada; ; Toronto, Ontario; Markham, Ontario; Kitchener, Ontariohttps://www.kitchener.ca/en/resourcesGeneral/Documents/DSD_ENG_C-of-K ---Standard-Specifications_November-2017.pdf * Boulevard strip: U.S. Upper Midwest * City grass * Common: New England, generally describes a large strip of grass.

This term was once used more widely to refer to the space between tracks on a streetcar line, a space not wide enough to stand in as cars passed. * Easement * Extension lawn: Ann Arbor, Michigan * Furniture zone, also planter/furniture zone or landscape/furniture zone: a term used by urban planners, indicating its suitability for \\"street furniture\\" such as utility poles and fire hydrants, as well as trees or planters * Government grass * Grass bay: New Jersey * Grassplot: East Coast of the United States, Pennsylvania * Green belt * Hellstrip * Island strip: Long Island, New York * Median: Washington, Oregon * Mow strip: SF East Bay Area Northern California * Nature strip: Australia * Neutral ground: U.S. Gulf states * Out lawn * Park strip: Ohio * Parking: Illinois, Iowa, Western United States * Parking strip: Washington, Oregon, Utah, much of California * Parkrow: Iowa, Oregon * Parkway: Greater Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast of the United States, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Florida, Texas * Parkway strip: Austin, Texas; Fort Collins, Colorado * Planter zone: SmartCode/New Urbanist terminology * Planting strip: Berkeley, California, Seattle, Washington * Right-of-way: Wisconsin, Illinois * Road allowance: Ottawa, Canada * Road reserve * Road verge: Australia * Roadside: Australia * Sidewalk buffer * Sidewalk lawn: Georgia * Sidewalk plot: Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Tennessee * Sidewalk strip: California, Oregon, Utah, Washington * Snow shelf: Connecticut * Street easement * Street lawn: Ohio * Swale: South Florida * Terrace: U.S. Great Lakes region, Missouri * \\"That Narrow Strip Of Grass Between The Sidewalk And The Street\\": Chattanooga, Tennessee * Tree belt: Massachusetts * Tree lawn or treelawn: Ohio, Indiana, New York, and elsewhere * Utility strip * Verge: UK, New Zealand, South Africa Western Australia * Yard sample Sustainable urban and landscape design Planted rain garden in the \\"tree lawn\\" zone In urban and suburban areas, urban runoff from private and civic properties can be guided by grading and bioswales for rainwater harvesting collection and bioretention within the \\"tree-lawn\\" ‚Äì parkway zone in rain gardens. This is done for reducing runoff of rain and domestic water: for their carrying waterborne pollution off-site into storm drains and sewer systems; and for the groundwater recharge of aquifers. In some cities, such as Santa Monica, California, city code mandates specify: > Parkways, the area between the outside edge of the sidewalk and the inside > edge of the curb which are a component of the Public Right of Way (PROW) ‚Äì > that the landscaping should require little or no irrigation and the area > produce no runoff. For Santa Monica, another reason for this use of \\"tree-lawns\\" is to reduce current beach and Santa Monica Bay ocean pollution that is measurably higher at city outfalls. New construction and remodeling projects needing building permits require that landscape design submittals include garden design plans showing the means of compliance. In some cities and counties, such as Portland, Oregon, street and highway departments are regrading and planting rain gardens in road verges to reduce boulevard and highway runoff. This practice can be useful in areas with either independent Storm sewers or combined storm and sanitary sewers, reducing the frequency of pollution, treatment costs, and released overflows of untreated sewage into rivers and oceans during rainstorms. Rural roadsides In some countries, the road verge can be a corridor of vegetation that remains after adjacent land has been cleared. Considerable effort in supporting conservation of the remnant vegetation is prevalent in Australia, where significant tracts of land are managed as part of the roadside conservation strategies by government agencies.

Julien Belleville had been a maker of marine boilers from around 1850. Louis Delaunay joined the firm in 1867 and married Belleville's daughter. He changed his name to Delaunay-Belleville and succeeded his father-in-law in charge of the company. S.A. des Automobiles Delaunay-Belleville was formed in 1903 by Louis Delaunay and . Barbarou's family owned the boiler making company St. Denis in Belleville, with boiler design influences inspired by the company. Barbarou, then 28,Wise, David Burgess. \\"Delaunay-Belleville: The Car Magnificent\\", in Ward, Ian, executive editor. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.525. had experience working for Cl√©ment, Lorraine-Dietrich and Benz and was responsible for design and styling, including the trademark round grille shell.Wise, p.525 caption. The first car was exhibited at the 1904 Paris Salon, and it received enormous acclaim.Wise, p.525. The company started with three models, all fours:Wise, p.525 and p.526. a live axled 16 hp and a 24 hp and 40 hp model, both chain-driven.Wise, p.525 and 526. These were likely the first automobiles to have pressure-lubricated camshafts.Wise, p.526. The bodies were attached with just four bolts, and the brakes were water-cooled, from a reservoir. Delaunay-Belleville were a prestige marque, and one of the world's leaders, from the outset, and by 1906, Emperor Nicholas II of Russia had purchased a 40. Other royal owners included King George I of Greece and King Alphonso XIII of Spain. The first French car maker to offer a six-cylinder engine, Delaunay- Belleville's 70 hp became available only in 1909, and then only in small numbers, remaining in limited production until 1912. This model came to be known as the Type SMT, or Sa Majest√© le Tsar, because Nicholas purchased one of the last 70s built. He also ordered another in 1909; the demand for a silent starter, operable from the driving seat, became known as a Barbey starter, and was made standard at the end of 1910. Like most prestige marques, the cars were sold as bare chassis and bodies were coachbuilt for them. Between 1906 and 1914, British imports were mainly bodied by Shinnie Brothers, a Burlington subsidiary, in Aberdeen, then shipped to London for sale. Postwar, Continental bodies gained popularity, at least in Britain, as Belgium's D'Ieteren Fr√®res became most associated with the company: their landaulette, on a 26 hp chassis, was priced in Britain at ‚Ç§900, between Napier and Rolls-Royce. After Barbarou resigned, Delaunay-Belleville quality began to slip. In 1919, the company offered a 10 hp four-cylinder, undoubtedly the most expensive voiturette on the market, as well as a 15.9 hp four, the P4B, in 1922. New four-cylinder overhead valve 14/40 and 16/60 models appeared in 1926, and the prewar 20 hp and 10 hp six-cylinder models continued to be produced until 1927. The last gasps were the 21 hp six of 1928 and the 21/75 OHV six of 1930. In 1931, Continental engines, imported from the US, were offered, being quieter and cheaper. By the late 1920s, Delaunay-Belleville had lost its prestige, and converted to truck and military vehicle production. In 1936 the previously separate car company was merged with the Delaunay- Belleville parent. Production of the Delaunay-Belleville RI-6 continued through the late 1930s and was revived after the Second World War. This was a six-cylinder-engined car strongly resembling the Mercedes-Benz 230, featuring independent suspension all-round; revived postwar, it featured Cotal preselector gearbox and a front grille design apparently copied from the 1939 Buick. However, the business was in decline: anyone buying a RI-6 in the 1940s would have done so in the knowledge after-sales service might disappear soon. Six cars were completed in 1947 and this sank to four during the first part of 1948. The company continued to advertise new cars for sale until 1950, but the factory was sold to Robert de Rovin in 1948 and thereafter used to make cyclecars.

In the far-infrared, stars are not especially bright, but emission from very cold matter (140 Kelvin or less) can be observed that is not seen at shorter wavelengths. This is due to thermal radiation of interstellar dust contained in molecular clouds. These emissions are from dust in circumstellar envelopes around numerous old red giant stars.

It is the engine used by the Konqueror web browser. Although it has not seen significant development since 2016, it is still actively maintained, and engines descended from KHTML are used by some of the world's most widely used browsers, among them Google Chrome, Safari, Opera, Vivaldi, and Microsoft Edge. Distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, KHTML is free software. Built on the KParts framework and written in C++, KHTML had relatively good support for Web standards. To render as many pages as possible, some extra abilities and quirks from Internet Explorer are also supported, even though those are non-standard. History =Origins= KHTML was preceded by an earlier engine called khtmlw or the KDE HTML Widget, developed by Torben Weis and Martin Jones, which implemented support for HTML 3.2, HTTP 1.0, and HTML frames, but not the W3C DOM, CSS, or scripting. KHTML itself came into existence on November 4, 1998, as a fork of the khtmlw library, with some slight refactoring and the addition of Unicode support and changes to support the move to Qt 2. Waldo Bastian was among those who did the work of creating that early version of KHTML. =Re-write and improvement= The real work on KHTML actually started between May and October 1999, with the realization that the choice facing the project was \\"either do a significant effort to move KHTML forward or to use Mozilla\\" and with adding support for scripting as the highest priority. So in May 1999, Lars Knoll began doing research with an eye toward implementing the W3C DOM specification, finally announcing on August 16, 1999 that he had checked in what amounted to a complete rewrite of the KHTML library‚Äîchanging KHTML to use the standard W3C DOM as its internal document representation. That in turn allowed the beginnings of JavaScript support to be added in October 1999, with the integration of Harri Porten's KJS following shortly afterwards. In the closing months of 1999 and first few months of 2000, Knoll did further work with Antti Koivisto and Dirk Mueller to add CSS support and to refine and stabilize the KHTML architecture, with most of that work being completed by March 2000. Among other things, those changes enabled KHTML to become the second browser after Internet Explorer to correctly support Hebrew and Arabic and languages written right-to-left‚Äîbefore Mozilla had such support. KDE 2.0 was the first KDE release (on October 23, 2000) to include KHTML (as the rendering engine of the new Konqueror file and web browser, which replaced the monolithic KDE File Manager). =Other modules= KSVG was first developed in 2001 by Nikolas Zimmermann and Rob Buis; however, by 2003, it was decided to fork the then-current KSVG implementation into two new projects: KDOM/KSVG2 (to improve the state of DOM rendering in KHTML underneath a more formidable SVG 1.0 render state) and Kcanvas (to abstract any rendering done within khtml/ksvg2 in a single shared library, with multiple backends for it, e.g., Cairo/Qt, etc.). KSVG2 is also a part of WebKit. Standards compliance The following standards are supported by the KHTML engine: * HTML 4.01 * HTML 5 support * CSS 1 * CSS 2.1 (screen and paged media) * CSS 3 Selectors (fully as of KDE 3.5.6) * CSS 3 Other (multiple backgrounds, box-sizing and text-shadow) * PNG, MNG, JPEG, GIF graphic formats * DOM 1, 2 and partially 3 * ECMA-262/JavaScript 1.5 * Partial Scalable Vector Graphics support Descendants KHTML and KJS were adopted by Apple in 2002 for use in the Safari web browser.

Credit:GALEX/NASA/JPL-Caltech. Ultraviolet astronomy is the observation of electromagnetic radiation at ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 nanometres; shorter wavelengths--higher energy photons--are studied by X-ray astronomy and gamma ray astronomy. Ultraviolet light is not visible to the human eye. Most of the light at these wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Overview Ultraviolet line spectrum measurements (spectroscopy) are used to discern the chemical composition, densities, and temperatures of the interstellar medium, and the temperature and composition of hot young stars. UV observations can also provide essential information about the evolution of galaxies. They can be used to discern the presence of a hot white dwarf or main sequence companion in orbit around a cooler star. The ultraviolet universe looks quite different from the familiar stars and galaxies seen in visible light. Most stars are actually relatively cool objects emitting much of their electromagnetic radiation in the visible or near-infrared part of the spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation is the signature of hotter objects, typically in the early and late stages of their evolution. In the Earth's sky seen in ultraviolet light, most stars would fade in prominence. Some very young massive stars and some very old stars and galaxies, growing hotter and producing higher-energy radiation near their birth or death, would be visible. Clouds of gas and dust would block the vision in many directions along the Milky Way. Space-based solar observatories such as SDO and SOHO use ultraviolet telescopes (called AIA and EIT, respectively) to view activity on the Sun and its corona. Weather satellites such as the GOES-R series also carry telescopes for observing the Sun in ultraviolet. The Hubble Space Telescope and FUSE have been the most recent major space telescopes to view the near and far UV spectrum of the sky, though other UV instruments have flown on smaller observatories such as GALEX, as well as sounding rockets and the Space Shuttle. Pioneers in ultraviolet astronomy include George Robert Carruthers, Robert Wilson, and Charles Stuart Bowyer. Andromeda Galaxy - in high-energy X-ray and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016).

The first cars named \\"Skyline GT-R\\" were produced between 1969 and 1972 under the model code KPGC10, and enjoyed legendary success in local Japanese touring car racing. This model was followed by a brief production run of second-generation cars, under model code KPGC110, in 1973. After a 16-year hiatus, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 as the BNR32 (\\"R32\\") Skyline GT-R. This model GT-R proceeded to win the Japanese JTCC Group A series championship four years in a row. The R32 GT-R also had success in the Australian Touring Car Championship helping the R31 Skyline GTS-R to victory in 1990 and winning alone in 1991 and 1992, until a regulation change excluded the GT-R in 1993. The technology and performance of the R32 GT-R prompted the Australian motoring publication Wheels to nickname the GT-R \\"Godzilla\\" in its July 1989 edition. Wheels then carried the name through all the generations of Skyline GT-Rs, most notably the R34 GT-R, \\"Godzilla Returns\\" was described as \\"The best handling car we have ever driven\\" and further ran a 12.2 quarter mile time and a 4.0 second 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time. The Skyline GT-R became the flagship of Nissan performance, showcasing many advanced technologies including the ATTESA E-TS All-wheel drive system and the Super-HICAS four-wheel steering. Today, the car is popular for import drag racing, circuit track, time attack and events hosted by tuning magazines. Production of the Skyline GT-R ended in August 2002. The car was replaced by the R35 GT-R, an all-new vehicle based on the V36 Skyline platform. Although visibly different, the two vehicles share similar design features and are manufactured in the same factory. The Skyline GT-R was never manufactured outside Japan, and the sole export markets were Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, in 1991, and the UK (in 1997, due to the Single Vehicle Approval scheme) as used Japanese imports. Despite this, the car has become an iconic sports car, including in countries from the Western World (mainly the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, Canada, and the United States).GTR Canada.Skyline owners board based in Canada. It has become notable through pop culture such as The Fast and the Furious, Initial D, Shakotan Boogie, Wangan Midnight, Need for Speed, Forza, Driving Emotion Type-S, and Gran Turismo. In 2019, Nismo announced that it would resume production of spare parts for all generations of the Skyline GT-R, including body panels and engines. The car was named at the time by BBC's Top Gear as the only true Japanese contribution in the line of supercars,Top Gear ‚Äì Season One, Episode 04. and by Jeremy Clarkson as one of the best cars in the world.Jeremy Clarkson's Motorworld: Japan ‚Äì \\"The Skyline ‚Äì and I'm not joking ‚Äî is one of the best cars... ...I have ever driven...\\"Jeremy Clarkson ‚Äì Top 100 Cars History of the brand Prince Skyline S54 The Skyline name originated from Prince automobile company, which developed and sold the Skyline line of sedans before merging with Nissan- Datsun. The original Skyline was launched by the Prince Motor Company in April 1957 and was powered by a 1.5-litre engine. The later iteration launched in 1964 called the Prince Skyline GT was powered by a 2.0-litre G7 inline-6 engine shared with the up market Prince Gloria sedan. Two road going versions were built. The S54A which had a single carburettor engine rated at and the S54B which had a triple carburettor engine rated at and production totalled 100 units. The GT-R abbreviation stands for Gran Turismo Racing while the GT-B stands for Gran Turismo Berlinetta. The Japanese chose to use Italian naming conventions when naming the car ‚Äì as most cars that were made in Japan at that time used Western abbreviations ‚Äì to further enhance sales. The earliest predecessor of the GT-R, the S54 2000 GT-B, came second in its first race in the 1964 Japanese GP to the purpose-built Porsche 904 GTS. However, the earlier Prince Skyline Sport coup√©/convertible foreshadowed the GT-R as the first sports-oriented model in the Skyline range, hence the name. The next development of the GT-R, the four-door PGC10 2000 GT-R, scored 33 victories in the one and a half years it raced, and by the time it attempted its 50th consecutive win, its run was ended by a Mazda Savanna RX-3. The car took 1,000 victories by the time it was discontinued in 1972. The last of the original GT-R models, the KPGC110 2000GT-R, used an unchanged S20 inline-6 engine from the earlier 2000 GT-R and only 197 units were sold due to the worldwide energy crisis. This model was the only GT-R to never participate in a major race despite being developed as a sole purpose-built race car, which now resides in Nissan's storage unit for historical cars in Zama. The Skyline continued into the 1990s when it became popular largely because it remained rear wheel drive, while most other manufacturers were focusing on front wheel drive cars. Throughout its lifetime, various special editions containing additional performance-enhancing modifications were introduced by Nissan and its performance division Nismo (Nissan Motorsport). Generations =First generation (1969‚Äì1972)= The first Skyline GT-R, known by the internal Nissan designation of PGC10, was introduced on 4 February 1969, and was exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealership network called Nissan Prince Store when the Prince company was integrated into Nissan operations in 1966. It was available originally as a four-door sedan after a public debut at the October 1968 Tokyo Motor Show. It was advertised alongside the Nissan R380 racecar to showcase the Skyline's racing heraldry. It was equipped with the 2.0 L DOHC S20 Inline- six engine rated at at 7,000 rpm and at 5,600 rpm. Power was delivered to the rear wheels by a 5-speed manual transmission and the car was equipped with a limited slip differential. The first Skyline GT-R rode on a semi-trailing arm strut suspension. The braking system consisted of disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. It was available in a coup√© bodystyle in March 1971 with the chassis code KPGC10. The interior of the car was very basic and featured racing bucket seats and a three-spoke steering wheel along with wood inserts. The pedals were finished in aluminium. A popular name for the PGC and KPGC10 Skyline GT-R was Hakosuka, which combines the Japanese word for box (\\"hako\\" or „Éè„Ç≥) and the pronounced abbreviation of skyline (\\"Suka\\" or „Çπ„Ç´ as in „Çπ„Ç´„Ç§„É©„Ç§„É≥ or \\"sukairain\\"). A total of 1,945 PGC and KPGC10 Skyline GT-Rs were produced. =Second generation (1973)= Rear view of an KPGC110 GT-R The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was introduced in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo Motor Show. Powered by a 1,989 cc S20 inline-6 engine, the second generation of the GT-R delivered power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disc brakes. The suspension was a semi-trailing ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added. This model of the GT-R was also known as the \\"Kenmeri\\" Skyline, due to a popular advertisement featuring a young couple (Ken and Mary) enjoying the Hokkaido countryside. The advertisement later spawned a hit song by Buzz, and the tree featured in the advertisement later became a minor star itself. Unfortunately, the second generation GT-R was unsuccessful, for a gasoline crisis hit in the early 1970s, drying out any demand for high-performance sports cars. A total of 197 cars were built by the end of its short production run. For the next decade, this was the last GT-R until the production of the R32 in 1989. =Third generation (1989‚Äì1994)= Concept After cancelling the Skyline GT-R in 1973, Nissan revived the GT-R nameplate again in 1989. At the time Nissan was competing in Group A Racing with the Skyline GTS-R. Nissan wanted to retire the GTS-R in favor of a more competitive vehicle. The new generation of the GT-R, E-BNR32 chassis (commonly shortened to R32), was designed to dominate Group A class racing. Nissan Kohki (Nissan's power train engineering and manufacturing facility) originally tested a twin turbocharged bored and stroked version of the RB20 engine. This set up resulted in a power output of and used a rear wheel drive drivetrain. Under Group A regulations, a turbocharged engine must multiply its engine displacement by 1.7, putting the new Skyline in the 4,000 cc class, and requiring the use of 10-inch-wide tyres. Knowing that they would be required to use 10-inch-wide tyres, Nissan decided to make the car all wheel drive. Nissan developed a special motorsport-oriented AWD system for this purpose called the ATTESA E-TS. Although this assisted with traction, it made the car heavier; the added weight put the GT-R at a disadvantage to other cars in the 4,000 cc class. Nissan then made the decision to increase the displacement to 2,600 cc, and put the car in the 4,500 cc class, with the car's weight near- equal to competing cars. The 4,500 cc class also allowed for 11-inch-wide tyres. New engine block and heads were then developed to better match the increased displacement. The result was a car that had a power output of .‚Äì Nissan Heritage Collection \\"R32 Story\\"..nissan-heritage-collection.com Later REINIK (Racing & Rally Engineering Division Incorporated Nissan Kohi) produced Group A racing engines rated between ‚Äì REINIK History \\"REINIK History\\". .reimax.co.jp/pages/history/index.html depending on track conditions. Production This new RB26DETT-powered all wheel drive concept was put into production as the R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R. The R32 developed at 6,800 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm, it had a curb weight of . Nissan officially started its production run 21 August 1989, and began its Group A campaign in 1990. The Skyline GT-R Nismo, identified by the model code suffix \\"RA\\", was introduced on 22 February 1990 and attracted a premium of over the standard car. It existed to homologate a number of changes related to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the \\"Evolution\\" special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, rising the production total to 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which is not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front panels are aluminium in all GT-R models rather than the standard steel in non GT-R models, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs compared to for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16-inch alloy wheels. Mechanically, the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the standard Garrett T03 turbo chargers with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spool up of the ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 \\"Gun Grey Metallic\\". Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular \\"Nismo\\" logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available included a speedometer, 3-inch cat-back exhaust system, front suspension tower brace, sports shock absorbers, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with a built-in third brake light. A rear view of an R32, showing the distinctive four round taillights The Skyline GT-R 'N1' model (identified by the model code suffix \\"ZN\\"), was introduced on 19 July 1991, and designed for home-market N1 racing with a total of 245 units eventually produced (118 of these are 'N1', 64 are 'V¬∑Spec N1', and 63 are 'V¬∑Spec II N1' - see below explanation of 'V.spec'). The most notable change was in the engine, which was upgraded to the R32-N1 specification. Building on the 'Nismo' car's specification, it was also lightened by the removal of the ABS, and rear wiper, but for 'N1' the air conditioning, sound system, and boot carpet were also deleted, and distinctive light-weight headlights were fitted. 'N1' cars also had reinforcing for the brake master cylinder and additional brake cooling ducts under the car. All 'N1' cars were delivered with a thin layer of colour code 326 \\"Crystal White\\" paint. To celebrate the success of the GT-R in both Group N and Group A racing, Nissan introduced the Skyline GT-R V¬∑Spec (\\"Victory SPECification\\") package on 3 February 1993. The V¬∑Spec added Brembo brakes and a retuned ATTESA E-TS system. The V¬∑Spec was available in both 'plain' and 'N1' variants, with all V¬∑Spec cars using the lightweight aluminium bonnet and front bumpers from the 'Nismo'. The cars also replaced the standard 16-inch wheels with 17-inch BBS wheels with 225/45R17 tyres. Finally on 14 February 1994, the Skyline GT-R V¬∑Spec II was introduced, with the only change being wider 245/45R17 tyres. The 'plain' V¬∑Spec and V¬∑Spec II had a curb weight of , weighing more than the standard GT-R.JLIMPORTS.AU ‚Äì Skyline R32 GT-R \\"Godzilla\\". .jlimports.com Total production of the V¬∑Spec and V¬∑Spec II was 1,396 and 1,306 units respectively. Production of the R32 Skyline GT-R ceased in November 1994 after a production run of 43,937 units. The most popular colours are KH2 \\"Gun Grey Metallic\\" (45% of cars), followed by 326 \\"Crystal White\\" (18%), 732 \\"Black Pearl Metallic\\" (13%), KL0 \\"Spark Silver Metallic\\" (12%).

On 1989, Japanese Best Motoring television program conducted a test on N√ºrburgring Nordscheleife with a production version Nissan Skyline GT-R R32. Driven by Motoharu Kurosawa, car lapped a 8:22.38 minutes lap time around the track.

The engine in the R33 was nearly identical to the R32. It used the same turbochargers and the same specification for the manual gearbox, although the syncros were stronger. The engine corrected the R32's weak oil pump drive collar, which tended to fail in higher power applications, by using a wider collar (also fixed in spec 2 R32's prior to R33 release). The base model of the R33 GT-R weighs . The R33 GT-R went on sale on 6 January 1995 with the base model GT-R and the V¬∑Spec model. The V¬∑Spec model weighed in heavier, and had sportier suspension resulting in lower ground clearance. The V¬∑Spec also featured the newer ATTESA E-TS Pro all wheel drive system, which included an Active Limited Slip differential. At the same time as the introduction of the R33 GT-R and GT-R V¬∑Spec, Nissan introduced the R33 GT-R V¬∑Spec N1 model. Changes made to the R33 N1 are similar to those in the R32 N1. The car was made lighter by removing the ABS, air conditioning, sound system, rear wiper, and boot carpet. The R33 GT-R V¬∑Spec N1 received the slightly revised R33 N1 engine. The R33 ended production on 9 November 1998. The last R33 GT-R produced was a V-Spec in GV1 finished in Black Pearl colour. On 1995, Best Motoring conducted a test for Nissan Skyline GT-R R33 at N√ºrburgring Nordscheleife. Driven by Motoharu Kurosawa, car lapped a 8:01.72 minutes lap time around the track. Making it fastest road-legal series production car and 2nd fastest road-legal production car around the track at the time. On 1996, the record has broken by a Dirk Schoysman driven Nissan Skyline GT-R R33 V - Spec which is conducted by Best Motoring, broke the record with a lap time of 7:59 minutes around track at the time. On 1999, record was broken by a Nissan Skyline GT-R R34. 1995 GT-R LM Nissan mostly competed in Group C racing with purpose built prototype race cars after the R32 GT-R was ousted from the Group A racing but rule changes for Group C forced Nissan to abandon Group C racing. Nissan then set out to develop one of its existing cars to enter the GT1 class racing in the BPR racing series. The company decided to base the new GT1 car on the R33 LM race car. The weight of the car was reduced to and the all-wheel-drive system was removed. The car was also considerably widened and lowered with a new bodykit in order to increase downforce. The car was equipped with the N1 specification engine which had a power output of . The engine was mated to a 6-speed sequential manual transmission manufactured by Xtrac. The homologation rules for GT1 class in 1995 required one road going equivalent to be made. Thus a single road going LM car was developed and stored at Nissan's Zuma facility. The road version of the car was detuned to and was equipped by the same wider bodykit as the racing version. The interior remained the same as the standard R33 GT-R albeit with an Alcantara rimmed steering wheel and racing bucket seats. Two race cars were built having numbers 22 and 23. They were entered in the 1995 season of LeMans but faced tough competition from more powerful race cars such as the Ferrari F40 LM and the McLaren F1 GTR. The number 22 car driven by H. Fukuyama and S. Kasuya qualified in the 34th season and finished 5th in its class with an overall position of 10th while the number 23 retired after 157 laps due to gearbox damage. Due to the entry of purpose built race cars by using loopholes in the regulations such as the Porsche 911 GT1, Nissan decided to withdraw for the 1996 season. 1996 LM Limited There were several limited editions of the BCNR33 produced. The first LeMans, or \\"LM\\" version, was introduced in May 1996 to celebrate Nissan's participation in the 24-hours of Le Mans. The only body colour available for the R33 LM was Champion Blue. The car had a front splitter lip to direct air to the upper front aperture, and a carbon fibre rear wing with Gurney flap. There were carbon fibre inserts on the rear wing fins with a GT-R badge on the inserts. The \\"GT-R Skyline\\" logo under the checkered flag was placed on the C-pillars. Nissan produced just 188 units of this model, 86 GT-R LM Limited and 102 V-Spec LM Limited. Limited edition factory fitted extras: * Championship Blue (code BT2). * Carbon Fibre Rear Wing Blade. * N1 Front Brake Cooling Ducts. * N1 Bonnet Lip. * Commemorative GT-R Decals on C-Pillars. 1997 NISMO 400R A special edition of the R33 was introduced on 3 November 1997 called the 400R, with R standing for Racing. Overall development and planning was by NISMO (Nissan Motorsports International). But, its bored and stroked RB26DETT engine, the RBX-GT2, was engineered and produced by REINIK (later renamed REIMAX ‚Äì \\"REINIK to the MAX\\"). The engine featured 77.7 mm stroke crankshaft (73.7 mm stock), forged 87 mm pistons (86 mm cast stock), upgraded rods, polished ports, high lift camshafts, upgraded oil system, larger exhaust manifolds and higher output turbochargers. NISMO produced an upgraded exhaust, a twin-plate clutch, and intercooler system. Nismo brake pads were fitted to the car. 400R exclusive aerodynamic updates were also added, such as wider bumpers, side skirts, a new rear bumper, a new front bumper with bigger air scoops, and a redesigned bonnet and rear spoiler made of carbon fibre. The 400R was also fitted with 18x10 Nismo LM-GT1s. The engine developed and , which allowed a top speed of over , and enabled it to accelerate from in 4.0 seconds. NISMO had originally planned to produce 100 units of the 400R, however, only 44 units were made before production of the R33 ended in 1998. Production figures * GT-R (Series 1) = 5050 * V¬∑Spec (Series 1) = 4095 * Unknown (Series 1) = 14 (Pre- production or early cars including GT-R, V¬∑Spec and V¬∑Spec N1). * GT-R (Series 2) = 2291 * V¬∑Spec (Series 2) = 1203 * LM Limited = 188 (86 GT-R LM Limited, 102 V¬∑Spec LM Limited) * GT-R (Series 3) = 1958 * V¬∑Spec (Series 3) = 1269 * Autech Version 40th Anniversary = 416 * N1 = 87 (Series 1 = 55 known, Series 2 = 21, Series 3 = 11) * UK V¬∑Spec = 97 (94x 17 digit VIN models plus 3 prototypes) * Total production = 16,668 =Fifth generation (1999‚Äì2002)= The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V¬∑Spec and GT-R V¬∑Spec N1 models were introduced in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang was reduced as compared to its predecessor. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020), as opposed to black in previous models. Paul Walker's Skyline GT-R used in the film 2 Fast 2 Furious. A new feature on the R34 GT-R is a 5.8\\" LCD multifunction display on the center of the dashboard, which shows seven different live readings of engine and vehicle statistics such as turbocharger pressure (1.2 bar max), oil and water temperature, among others. The GT-R V¬∑Spec model added two extra features to the display: intake and exhaust gas temperatures. Nismo Multi-function Displays (MFD) could be bought at an extra cost, they included a lap timer, G-Force meter and an increase in boost pressure measurement to 2 bar. The R34 GT-R was made shorter in response to customer concerns who thought the R33 was too bulky. Like the R33, the new R34 GT-R V¬∑Spec (Victory Specification) models come equipped with the ATTESA E-TS Pro system and an Active LSD at the rear, while standard GT-R models come with the non-Pro system and a conventional mechanical differential. The V¬∑Spec model also had firmer suspension and lower ground clearance, thanks to front and side splitters, as well as a rear carbon fibre air diffuser, designed to keep air flowing smoothly under the car. At the time of the R34's introduction, like the R32 and R33, Nissan introduced an R34 V¬∑Spec N1 model. The R34 V¬∑Spec N1 was equipped similar to the R32 and R33 N1 models ‚Äì a homologation special. It was sold without air conditioning, audio equipment, rear wiper, or boot lining, but ABS remained. The new R34 N1 was also given the new R34 N1 engine. Only 38 known R34 V¬∑Spec N1 models were produced from the factory, 12 of which Nismo used for Super Taikyu racing. The rest were sold to various customers, mostly racing teams and tuning garages. The V¬∑Spec version was also imported into the UK with a number of modifications carried out on these 80 cars.These included 3 additional oil coolers, revised ECU map, full Connolly leather interior, underbody diffusers, stiffer suspension, active rear limited slip differential, extra display feature on the in car display. In additional to the UK, 10 were sold to Hong Kong and Singapore, and 5 to New Zealand although with different changes for their respective markets. Rear view of an R34 GT-R M¬∑spec N√ºr In October 2000, Nissan introduced the V¬∑Spec II, replacing the V¬∑Spec. The V¬∑Spec II has increased stiffness in the suspension (even stiffer than the original V¬∑Spec) and had larger rear brake rotors. It also comes equipped with a carbon fibre bonnet equipped with a NACA duct, which is lighter than the aluminium that all other GT-R bonnets are made from. Also different on the V¬∑Spec II was an iridium center console and aluminium pedals. The seats were upholstered with black cloth rather than the gray cloth used on previous R34 GT-R models, and the amber turn lenses were replaced with white versions. With the exception of the carbon fibre bonnet, the standard trim level GT-R also received these updates. A total of 18 V¬∑Spec II N1 were built. A total of 1855 V¬∑Spec II were built for Japan, with an additional 2 being sold for the New Zealand market. The V¬∑Spec N1 was replaced with the V¬∑Spec II N1. The same changes applied to the V¬∑Spec N1 were applied to the V¬∑Spec II N1, with the exception of the V¬∑Spec II carbon bonnet which was now unpainted. In May 2001, the M¬∑Spec was introduced. It was based on the V-Spec II, but had special \\"Ripple control\\" dampers, revised suspension set up, stiffer rear sway bar and a leather interior with heated front seats. The 'M' on the M¬∑Spec stood for Mizuno who is the chief engineer of Nissan. The only other change was the removal of the carbon fibre bonnet which was replaced with the standard aluminium bonnet. In February 2002, Nissan launched a final production model of the R34 GT-R called the Skyline GT-R V¬∑Spec II N√ºr and the Skyline GT-R M¬∑Spec N√ºr. The N√ºr was named after the famous German N√ºrburgring racetrack, where the Skyline was developed. In total 1,003 units R34 GT-R N√ºr(s) were produced, 718 were V¬∑Spec II N√ºrs' and 285 were M¬∑Spec N√ºrs'. The N√ºr model featured an improved RB26DETT based on the N1 racing engine. The standard turbochargers were upgraded to larger versions with a slight increase in boost and the ceramic blades were replaced with steel versions. This has increased lag, but the turbo's durability was improved while being able to handle a bigger boost increase. The V¬∑Spec II N√ºr is based on the regular V¬∑Spec II model, and the M¬∑Spec N√ºr was based on the regular M¬∑Spec model. Other than the addition of the N√ºr engine, the N√ºr models also included a different colour of stitching on the interior trim, as well as a speedometer reading up to , gold valve covers instead of red and a gold VIN plate instead of silver. Due to Japanese car industry norms at the time, the car was advertised as having but it actually had over when it left the factory. On 1999, Nissan conducted a test for Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 on the N√ºrburgring Nordscheleife. Car ran a 7:52 minutes of a lap time, driven by Nissan's test driver Kazuo Shimizu. Car broke the Nissan Skyline GT-R R33 V - Spec's record which is the fastest road-legal series production car and 2nd fastest road-legal production car around the track at the time.

NISMO originally designed the concept of the Z-tune in 2002 when Nissan was putting an end to the R34 Skyline production. The first Z-tune was built in 2003, using a used 2002 Skyline GT-R V¬∑Spec II. It was built with a concept RB26DETT 'Z1' engine. This engine was based on Nissan's Le Mans GT2 and GT500 racing experiences. As with the racing vehicles a strengthened engine block and stroked crankshaft were utilised. The engine was also bored. With the new displacement of 2.8 L and upgraded turbochargers the Z1 engine was rated at at 6800 rpm and of torque at 5200 rpm. The Z-Tune had a 0-100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of 3.8 seconds and has a top speed of over . Nismo was then given the approval from Nissan to build Z-tune models for the Nismo anniversary. Nismo then purchased 18 used R34 GT-R V¬∑Spec, each with less than on the odometer, they were then completely stripped and were resprayed to a \\"Z-tune Silver,\\" a special colour exclusively for the Z-tune.Sports Compact Magazine ‚Äì NISMO Z-TuneNISMO bought used GT-R V¬∑spec, each with less than 18K miles on the odometer, and stripped them to bare shells. One car was left in its original colour of Midnight Purple III. For each of the 18 production models, the 2.8 L engine was revised to allow it to reach a speed of 8,000 rpm. The turbochargers were supplied by IHI in Japan. The engine is advertised to be able to generate (for warranty reasons). This second revision of the Z-tune engine is called the 'Z2'. The bodywork is designed with the same functional components used in Nismo's GT500 racing cars, such as engine bay vents on the bonnet and bumpers, as well as wider arches for wider wheels. The Z-tune is also improved with an aggressive suspension setup from Sachs, and a specially designed Brembo brake system. The entire car is essentially handmade, with the car being completely stripped and re-built from the ground up. Engineers reinforced and stiffened the chassis seam welding in key areas such as the door seams and door frames and added carbon fibre to the strut towers and transmission tunnel and the engine bay, completely redesigning the suspension, drivetrain, engine, gearbox and other components so as to work at maximum efficiency and reliability as is expected of a road-going vehicle. Although Nismo planned on building 20 cars, they ceased production on only 19 (including 2 prototypes).Z-Tune News: Z-Tune Discontinuednismo.co.jp. =Replacement= Following the end of R34 production in 2002, Nissan announced they would separate the GT-R model from the Skyline name, creating an entirely new vehicle‚Äîthough based on the same platform as the Skyline. This new car, now known simply as the Nissan GT-R, debuted in 2007 in Tokyo. Introduced to consumers in 2008, it was the first GT-R available worldwide, entering the North American market for the first time. The GT-R uses the Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the FM platform first used by the V35 generation of the Skyline. The car retains its heritage by using the chassis code CBA-R35 (2009-2011), DBA-R35 (2012-2016), 4BA-R35 (2017-present) or simply R35. Powertrain RB26DETT as used in the R32 and R33 Skyline GT-Rs The GT-R of the 1990s included a 2.6 L straight six-cylinder twin-turbo engine producing . The standard turbochargers were of a hybrid steel/ceramic design allowing them to spool up faster due to the light nature of the ceramic exhaust wheel. The drive train delivered power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery to the front wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V‚Ä¢Spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it is not related to the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual. The car also had computer-controlled all wheel steering system referred to as HICAS. The HICAS system activated when the vehicle exceeded and controlled the steering of the rear wheels in the same direction as the front to improve turn in on entry to corners. This feature is often seen as more of a hindrance than help in race applications. The system tends to favor less experienced drivers, and can make the rear suspension unstable during high speed cornering. While the published figures from Nissan were as quoted above, tests showed the car had a factory power output of closer to at the flywheel. The lower published figure was Nissan's response to the need to abide by a gentleman's agreement between the Japanese auto manufacturers not to introduce a car to the public exceeding of power output. =N1 engines= RB26DETT N1 is an upgraded version of the standard RB26DETT engine. It was developed by Nissan Kohki's REINIK division for NISMO and N1 race cars. The standard RB26DETT, although known for its durability, proved to require too much maintenance for Group N (N1 class) racing conditions. REINIK started with a strengthened RB26DETT block. The N1 block is identified by its 24U number stamped on the block (05U standard blocks). The cylinder walls are thicker and water cooling channels are enhanced to increase flow. It also received an upgraded oil pump and water pump, to improve the cooling and lubrication for race conditions. The pistons have top rings and were balanced before assembly but otherwise very close to standard. The connecting rods are also similar to standard but made from slightly stronger material and balanced. Standard crankshaft is balanced to a higher level. Higher flow exhaust manifolds and turbochargers were added for increased torque and slightly higher top-end power. Turbine wheels on the N1 turbochargers are also made from steel for durability, rather than the lighter but weaker ceramic found on the standard turbine. The R32 Skyline GT-R N1 road car marked the N1 engine's introduction to the ordinary consumer. R32, 33, and 34 N1 road cars were known for lack of amenities and their light weight. The R33 N1 engine and turbochargers were slightly revised, and the R34 N1 engine saw further improvement. The camshaft timing was altered slightly for more torque. R33 and R34 N1 turbochargers are the same size however R34 N1s use a ball bearing center section. NISMO states the ball bearings in the R34 N1 allow them to spool 400 rpm faster than R33 N1. The final N1 engine is the R34 N√ºr engine. The only differences are the cam cover colour change from red to gold and R34 N√ºr edition was a fully loaded street car. There were 1,000 N√ºr engines made for use in the R34 V.spec II N√ºr and R34 M-spec N√ºr models. Motorsports alt= The GT-R's history of racetrack dominance began with its 50 victories scored from 1968 to 1972, including 49 consecutive wins in the Japanese race circuit. Nissan pulled out of racing shortly after the introduction of the KPGC110 due to the 1973 oil crisis. The Skyline GT-R later earned the nickname \\"Godzilla\\", as a play on its \\"monster\\" track performance and country of origin. The R32 GT-R dominated JTCC, won all 29 races it entered in the series, as well as taking the series title every year from 1989 to 1993. A Nissan R34 GT-R GT500 competition car It took 50 races from 50 starts from 1991 to 1997 (latterly R33) in the N1 Super Taikyu. The GT-R's success sounded the death knell of Group A Touring Car racing; with the formula being scrapped soon after. JTCC was similarly dominated by the R32 GT-R, and splintered soon after, leading to the switch to the Supertouring category and also indirectly to the GT500 category of today. The GT-R's success in motor racing was formidable, particularly in the annual race at the Mount Panorama circuit in Bathurst, Australia, where the winner in 1991 and 1992 was a GT-R (despite receiving additional in weight penalties and a turbo pressure relief valve in 1992, and crashing). It took the overall win of the 1991 Spa 24 Hours, after getting the pole position and fastest lap time, ahead of the Porsche 911 and BMW M3 Evolution. It remained dominant in the Japanese GT series for many years. The Skyline GT-R was retired from the JGTC series (later changed Super GT Series) in 2004. Its successor, the Nissan GT-R, competed and dominated the 2008 Super GT season, winning the GT500 (see details below). No other GT-R race victories escaped controversy. At the 1990 Macau Grand Prix Guia touring car race, the factory-backed R32, driven by Masahiro Hasemi, led the race from start to finish, which caused a wave of protests by European entrants. The following year, officials forced the car to carry a weight penalty of . That year, it was also up against the more competitive DTM BMW M3 and Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5‚Äì16 Evolution II. A disgruntled Hasemi took fourth place. For the following and final year, the weight penalty was reduced, and works-backed Hasemi returned with another privateer R32. The privateer crashed, and Hasemi retired with engine failure. In the UK, Andy Middlehurst took the Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32) to two consecutive championship wins in the National Saloon Car Cup. Other championship titles include the 1991 Australian Touring Car Championship (Jim Richards), the 1991 Australian Endurance Championship (Mark Gibbs & Rowan Onslow), the 1991 Australian Manufacturers' Championship, the 1992 Australian Touring Car Championship (Mark Skaife) and the 1992 Spanish Touring Car Championship. Janspeed provided three cars to race in Europe. One car to run for Andy Middlehurst in the UK in the National Touring Car Series. In 1990 they entered three cars in the SPA-Francorchamps 24 hours. They managed a tremendous finish of one, two and three in class. Three cars were entered to run in the SPA 24 hours in which it finished first and second in its class (Group N) in 1991. A GT-R Group A car also took first overall. In 1992 they finished second in Group N with the Group A entry retiring due to a pit fire. Janspeed also ran a GT-R in the Spanish Touring Car Championship (CET). This car won the championship driven by Luis P√©rez-Sala.

He and again in 1998. For the following year, Rhys Millen took an R33 Skyline GT-R to win the High-Performance Showroom Stock category. The GT-R debuted in the US at 1994 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona. Nismo entered a sole Group A specification R32 for the GTU category. This car was so fast in the infield section in the first practice that the competition colluded to have restrictors fitted. The team was not allowed to run again until they fitted them. They eventually finished 20th. NISSAN was probably not too upset as they did not import the GT-R model to the USA. However, they did sell the 300ZX and it was one of those that won. An R33 Skyline GT-R LM that competed at the alt= In 1995 Nismo developed the Skyline GT-R for endurance racing with a pair of JGTC specification R33s for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. These were not allowed to run a four-wheel drive. To meet homologation regulations, Nissan had to build at least one street-legal version. The two racing cars achieved some success at Le Mans, with one car placing tenth overall, and fifth in its GT1 class‚Äîbeaten only by the more developed McLaren F1 GTRs and the GT2 class champion No.84 Honda NSX with a turbocharged engine (even though this is not available on the road car) entered by Team Kunimitsu. For , the Skyline GT-R LMs returned, this time carrying enlarged RB26DETTs displacing 2.8 litres. Again competing in GT1, they finished 15th overall and 10th in class. However, Nissan chose to abandon their production-based Skyline GT-R LMs in 1997 and instead turn to the purpose-built R390 GT1. In honour of the success of the Skyline at Le Mans, Nissan marketed a limited edition R33 they called the LM Limited, available only in \\"Champion Blue\\" (colour code BT2). In 2006 Automotive Forums.com became the first team to compete with an R34 GT-R in the United States, participating in the Speed World Challenge GT series.

It works by showing that if one randomly chooses objects from a specified class, the probability that the result is of the prescribed kind is strictly greater than zero. Although the proof uses probability, the final conclusion is determined for certain, without any possible error. This method has now been applied to other areas of mathematics such as number theory, linear algebra, and real analysis, as well as in computer science (e.g. randomized rounding), and information theory. Introduction If every object in a collection of objects fails to have a certain property, then the probability that a random object chosen from the collection has that property is zero. Similarly, showing that the probability is (strictly) less than 1 can be used to prove the existence of an object that does not satisfy the prescribed properties. Another way to use the probabilistic method is by calculating the expected value of some random variable. If it can be shown that the random variable can take on a value less than the expected value, this proves that the random variable can also take on some value greater than the expected value. Common tools used in the probabilistic method include Markov's inequality, the Chernoff bound, and the Lov√°sz local lemma. Two examples due to Erd≈ës Although others before him proved theorems via the probabilistic method (for example, Szele's 1943 result that there exist tournaments containing a large number of Hamiltonian cycles), many of the most well known proofs using this method are due to Erd≈ës. The first example below describes one such result from 1947 that gives a proof of a lower bound for the Ramsey number . =First example= Suppose we have a complete graph on vertices. We wish to show (for small enough values of ) that it is possible to color the edges of the graph in two colors (say red and blue) so that there is no complete subgraph on vertices which is monochromatic (every edge colored the same color). To do so, we color the graph randomly. Color each edge independently with probability of being red and of being blue. We calculate the expected number of monochromatic subgraphs on vertices as follows: For any set S_r of r vertices from our graph, define the variable X(S_r) to be if every edge amongst the r vertices is the same color, and otherwise. Note that the number of monochromatic r-subgraphs is the sum of X(S_r) over all possible subsets S_r. For any individual set S_r^i, the expected value of X(S_r^i) is simply the probability that all of the C(r, 2) edges in S_r^i are the same color: :E[X(S_r^i)] = 2 \\\\cdot 2^{-{r \\\\choose 2}} (the factor of comes because there are two possible colors). This holds true for any of the C(n, r) possible subsets we could have chosen, i.e. i ranges from to C(n,r). So we have that the sum of E[X(S_r^i)] over all S_r^i is :\\\\sum_{i=1}^{C(n,r)} E[X(S_r^i)] = {n \\\\choose r}2^{1-{r \\\\choose 2}}. The sum of expectations is the expectation of the sum (regardless of whether the variables are independent), so the expectation of the sum (the expected number of all monochromatic r-subgraphs) is :E[X(S_r)] = {n \\\\choose r}2^{1-{r \\\\choose 2}}. Consider what happens if this value is less than . Since the expected number of monochromatic -subgraphs is strictly less than , it must be that a specific random coloring satisfies that the number of monochromatic -subgraphs is strictly less than . The number of monochromatic -subgraphs in this random coloring is a non-negative integer, hence it must be ( is the only non- negative integer less than ). It follows that if :E[X(S_r)] = {n \\\\choose r}2^{1-{r \\\\choose 2}} < 1 (which holds, for example, for =5 and =4), there must exist a coloring in which there are no monochromatic -subgraphs. By definition of the Ramsey number, this implies that must be bigger than . In particular, must grow at least exponentially with . A peculiarity of this argument is that it is entirely nonconstructive. Even though it proves (for example) that almost every coloring of the complete graph on vertices contains no monochromatic -subgraph, it gives no explicit example of such a coloring. The problem of finding such a coloring has been open for more than 50 years. \\\\---- =Second example= A 1959 paper of Erd≈ës (see reference cited below) addressed the following problem in graph theory: given positive integers and , does there exist a graph containing only cycles of length at least , such that the chromatic number of is at least ? It can be shown that such a graph exists for any and , and the proof is reasonably simple. Let be very large and consider a random graph on vertices, where every edge in exists with probability . We show that with positive probability, satisfies the following two properties: :Property 1. contains at most cycles of length less than . Proof. Let be the number cycles of length less than . Number of cycles of length in the complete graph on vertices is :\\\\frac{n!}{2\\\\cdot i \\\\cdot (n-i)!} \\\\le \\\\frac{n^i}{2} and each of them is present in with probability . Hence by Markov's inequality we have :\\\\Pr \\\\left (X> \\\\tfrac{n}{2} \\\\right )\\\\le \\\\frac{2}{n} E[X] \\\\le \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=3}^{g-1} p^i n^i = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=3}^{g-1} n^{\\\\frac{i}{g}} \\\\le \\\\frac{g}{n} n^{\\\\frac{g-1}{g}} = gn^{-\\\\frac{1}{g}} = o(1). : Thus for sufficiently large , property 1 holds with a probability of more than . :Property 2. contains no independent set of size \\\\lceil \\\\tfrac{n}{2k} \\\\rceil. Proof. Let be the size of the largest independent set in . Clearly, we have :\\\\Pr (Y\\\\ge y) \\\\le {n \\\\choose y}(1-p)^{\\\\frac{y(y-1)}{2}} \\\\le n^y e^{-\\\\frac{py(y-1)}{2}} = e^{- \\\\frac{y}{2} \\\\cdot (py -2\\\\ln n - p)} = o(1), when :y = \\\\left \\\\lceil \\\\frac{n}{2k} \\\\right \\\\rceil. Thus, for sufficiently large , property 2 holds with a probability of more than . For sufficiently large , the probability that a graph from the distribution has both properties is positive, as the events for these properties cannot be disjoint (if they were, their probabilities would sum up to more than 1). Here comes the trick: since has these two properties, we can remove at most vertices from to obtain a new graph on n'\\\\geq n/2 vertices that contains only cycles of length at least . We can see that this new graph has no independent set of size \\\\left \\\\lceil \\\\frac{n'}{k}\\\\right\\\\rceil. can only be partitioned into at least independent sets, and, hence, has chromatic number at least . This result gives a hint as to why the computation of the chromatic number of a graph is so difficult: even when there are no local reasons (such as small cycles) for a graph to require many colors the chromatic number can still be arbitrarily large.

He was briefly present in North America, serving one term as the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and supported the creation of Roger Williams' Rhode Island Colony and Harvard College. A proponent of religious tolerance, he returned to England in 1637 following the Antinomian controversy that led to the banning of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts. He was a leading Parliamentarian during the English Civil War and worked closely with Oliver Cromwell. He played no part in the execution of King Charles I, and refused to take oaths that expressed approval of the act. Vane served on the Council of State that functioned as the government executive during the Interregnum, but split with Cromwell over issues of governance and removed himself from power when Cromwell dissolved Parliament in 1653. He returned to power during the short-lived Commonwealth period in 1659‚Äì1660, and was arrested under orders from King Charles II following his restoration to the throne. After long debate, Vane was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, and was thus denied amnesty granted to most people for their roles in the Civil War and Interregnum. Although he was formally granted clemency by Charles II, he was charged with high treason by Parliament in 1662. In a court proceeding in which he was denied counsel and the opportunity to properly prepare a defence, he was convicted by a partisan jury. Charles withdrew his earlier clemency, and Vane was beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 June 1662. Vane was recognised by his political peers as a competent administrator and a wily and persuasive negotiator and politician. His politics was driven by a desire for religious tolerance in an era when governments were used to establish official churches and suppress dissenting views. Although his views were in a small minority, he was able to successfully build coalitions to advance his agenda. His actions were often ultimately divisive, and contributed to both the rise and downfall of the English Commonwealth. His books and pamphlets written on political and religious subjects are still analyzed today, and Vane is remembered in Massachusetts and Rhode Island as an early champion of religious freedom. Early life Sir Henry Vane the Elder, portrait by Michiel Jansz. van Miereveldt Henry Vane was baptised on 26 May 1613 at Debden, Essex. He was the eldest child of Sir Henry Vane the Elder, who came from the landed gentry, and Frances Darcy, who came from minor nobility.Ireland, pp. 33‚Äì35 The elder Vane used the family's money to purchase positions at court, rising by 1629 to be Comptroller of the Household. Vane was educated at Westminster School, where his classmates included Arthur Heselrige and Thomas Scot, two other men who would figure prominently in English politics.Ireland, p. 36 Vane's friend and biographer George Sikes wrote that Vane was \\"[ignorant] of God\\" and of a temperament that made him \\"acceptable to those they call good fellows\\", but that he had a religious awakening at 14 or 15, after which he \\"and his former jolly company came to a parting blow.\\"Ireland, p. 37 Vane then enrolled at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he studied in spite of his refusal to take the necessary matriculation oaths. He then travelled to Europe, where he was reported to be studying at Leiden and possibly in France and at Geneva. Vane's father had been upset by his open adoption of Puritan views, fearing this would hamper his opportunities for advancement at court. In 1631 he sent the young Vane to Vienna as an assistant to Robert Anstruther, the English ambassador. This was apparently a quite privileged role, for Vane's writings of the time include messages written in French and in cipher.Ireland, p. 40 During this trip the elder Vane was sent to negotiate with Swedish King Gustavus for an alliance; King Charles' unwillingness to act in the matter meant the effort was in vain.Adamson and Folland, p. 35 He was introduced to the king after returning to England, and encouraged by his father to seek a position in the privy chamber.Ireland, pp. 45‚Äì46 His father engaged in numerous attempts to get him to give up his nonconformist views, without success. In order to worship as he chose, Vane then decided to go the New World, joining the Puritan migration.Ireland, p. 54 New England Vane left for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, arriving in Boston in October 1635 on a ship also carrying John Winthrop the Younger and Hugh Peter.Ireland, p. 57 The elder John Winthrop described Vane as \\"a young gentleman of excellent parts\\", and by the following month he had already been admitted as a freeman in the colony. He began playing a role in its judicial administration, deciding whether legal disputes had sufficient merit to be heard by a full court.Adamson and Folland, pp.65‚Äì66 Vane was instrumental in brokering the resolution to a dispute between the elder Winthrop and Thomas Dudley concerning matters of judicial conduct.Ireland, p. 69 In the spring of 1637 Vane was elected governor of the colony, succeeding John Haynes.Ireland, pp. 69‚Äì70 The situation he faced was complex, with issues on religious, political and military fronts. His biographers describe his term in office as \\"disastrous\\".Adamson and Folland, p. 69 Engraving depicting the trial of Anne Hutchinson The colony was split over the actions and beliefs of Anne Hutchinson. She had come with her husband and children to the colony in 1634, and began holding Bible sessions at home, gaining a wide audience and sharing her opinions that the colonial leaders labeled as Antinomianism, the view that existing laws and practices were not necessary for salvation.Anderson, pp. 477,482 Most of the older colonial leadership, including Dudley and Winthrop, espoused a more Legalist view. Vane was a supporter of Hutchinson, as was at first the influential pastor John Cotton, and this was the faction that propelled Vane into the governor's seat in 1636.Moore, pp. 287‚Äì288 Vane, however, immediately alienated some of the colonists by insisting on flying the English flag over Boston's fort.Moore, p. 318 The flag had recently been the subject of controversy, since its depiction of the Cross of St George was seen by many colonists as a symbol of papacy, and John Endecott had notoriously cut the cross out of the Salem militia's flag.Moore, p. 317 Vane's popularity declined further when he learned in December 1636 that there were issues in England requiring his presence, and he attempted to resign. Although the court of assistants accepted his resignation, he withdrew it upon the request of the congregation of the Boston church.Ireland, pp. 81‚Äì82 During Vane's tenure a dispute with the Pequot tribe of present-day southeastern Connecticut boiled over into war. In 1636 the boat of a Massachusetts trader named John Oldham was found near Block Island, overrun by Indians. Further examination by the discoverers (after the Indians fled in canoes) uncovered Oldham's body on board.Cave, p. 104 The attackers were at the time believed to be from tribes affiliated with the Narragansetts, but Narragansett leaders claimed that those responsible had fled to the protection of the Pequots.Moore, p. 267Cave, pp. 105‚Äì107 The Pequots were aggressively expansionist in their dealings with the surrounding native tribes (including the Narragansett), but had until then generally kept the peace with the nearby colonists. Massachusetts authorities were already angry that the Pequots had failed to turn over men implicated in the killing of another trader on the Connecticut River; the slaying of Oldham led to calls for action.Cave, pp. 100, 107‚Äì109 Despite the fact that Roger Williams had warned him that the Narragansetts were more likely responsible for Oldham's slaying, Governor Vane in August 1636 placed John Endecott at the head of a 90-man force to extract justice from the Pequots.Cave, p. 109 Endecott's heavy-handed expedition did little more than destroy Pequot settlements, and sparked a military backlash. The Pequots struck back at settlements recently established on the Connecticut River by colonists from Massachusetts, and at the Saybrook Colony of the younger John Winthrop.Cave, pp. 135‚Äì136 In April 1637 the ostensibly pacifist Vane called a session of the general court that authorized the colonial militia to assist the other New England colonies in continuing the war, which eventually ended in the destruction of the Pequots as a tribal entity.Adamson and Folland, p. 98 Engraving depicting Roger Williams with the Narragansett Indians Vane lost his position to the elder John Winthrop in the 1637 election.Doherty, p. 93 The contentious election was marked by a sharp disagreement over the treatment of John Wheelwright, another Hutchinson supporter.Bremer, pp. 276‚Äì277 Winthrop won in part because the location of the vote was moved to Cambridge, reducing the power of Vane's Boston support.Ireland, p. 82 In the aftermath of the election Anne Hutchinson was put on trial, and eventually banished from the colony. Many of her followers seriously considered leaving after the election. At the urging of Roger Williams, some of these people, including Hutchinson, founded the settlement of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island in the Narragansett Bay (later named Rhode Island and joined to Providence to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations). Vane decided to return to England, apparently with the notion that he would acquire a royal governorship to trump the colonial administration.Winship, p. 9 Before his departure, he published A Brief Answer to a Certain Declaration, a response to Winthrop's defense of the Act of Exclusion; this act was passed after the election to restrict the immigration of people with views not conforming to the colony's religious orthodoxy.Adamson and Folland, p. 104 Despite their political differences, Vane and Winthrop developed an epistolary relationship in the following years.Ireland, p. 96 Vane's legacy from his time in the New World includes the colonial legislation appropriating ¬£400 for the establishment of an institute of higher learning now known as Harvard University,Hosmer (1888), p. 52 and his support of Roger Williams in the acquisition of Aquidneck Island from the local Indians that resulted in the formal beginnings of Rhode Island. The surviving accounts do not say that Vane provide the funds for the acquisition; Williams credits Vane as being \\"an instrument in the hand of God for procuring this island\\".Hosmer (1888), p. 67 According to historian Michael Winship, Vane's experiences in Massachusetts significantly radicalized his religious views, in which he came to believe that clergy of all types, including Puritan ministers, \\"were the second beast of Revelations 13:11\\", \\"pretending to visible Saintship\\".Winship, p. 245 This conviction drove his political activities in England, where he sought to minimize the power and influence of all types of clergy. Biographer Violet Rowe writes that \\"Vane's guiding principles in religious policy seem to have been two: a rooted distrust of clerical power, whether of bishops or presbyters, and a belief that the State should abstain from interference in church matters altogether.\\"Rowe, p. 200 Vane's stance can be seen in the way the first Rhode Island patent was drafted in 1643, when he sat on the Parliamentary committee charged with colonial affairs.King, pp. 110‚Äì113 Unique among all of the early English colonial charters, it contains provisions guaranteeing freedom of religion.King, p. 115 (Vane assisted Roger Williams again in 1652, when the latter sought a confirmation of the Rhode Island charter and the revocation of a conflicting charter that had been issued to William Coddington.)King, pp. 117‚Äì124 Return to England On his return to England, he procured, with the assistance of the Earl of Northumberland and his father, a position as Treasurer of the Royal Navy in 1639.Adamson and Folland, p. 130 In this position he had the personally distasteful yet highly profitable task of collecting the hated ship money (a tax to support the Navy imposed by Charles I without Parliamentary approval).Adamson and Folland, pp. 130‚Äì131 In June 1640 he was awarded a knighthood by King Charles.Adamson, pp. 138‚Äì139 He married Frances Wray, daughter of Sir Christopher Wray, on 1 July 1640, after which his father settled upon him most of the family's holdings. These included Fairlawn in Kent, and Raby Castle, where Vane would make his home.Adamson and Folland, p. 140 According to his biographers, the relationship with Frances was anchored by shared spiritual goals and intimacy, and was happy and fulfilling.Adamson and Folland, pp. 140‚Äì141 Engraving by Wenceslas Hollar depicting the trial of the Earl of Strafford The connection with the admiralty secured for him election to the Short and Long Parliaments representing Hull. Vane had already formed or renewed associations with prominent opponents of Charles' policies, including John Pym and John Hampden. In the Short Parliament he was noted to be \\"capable of managing great affairs\\", with a \\"penetrating judgment\\" and an \\"easy and graceful manner of speaking.\\"Hosmer (1888), p. 100 With others like Nathaniel Fiennes, he represented a younger generation of Puritans in the leadership of the Long Parliament that effectively managed affairs: as identified by Clarendon in his history, these included Hampden, Pym, and Oliver St John in the Commons, and Earl of Bedford and Viscount Saye and Sele in the Lords.Clarendon, p. 1:362 Vane was instrumental in the 1641 impeachment and execution of the Earl of Strafford, a member of the Privy Council. Vane discovered some confidential notes his father had made of a council meeting, and passed them to John Pym. The wording in those notes could be interpreted to mean that Strafford had proposed that Charles use the Irish Army to subjugate England.Hosmer (1888), pp. 126‚Äì127 The evidence against Strafford was weak, and the impeachment failed.Purkiss, p. 115 Pym consequently orchestrated the passage of a bill of attainder against Strafford, who was then executed in May 1641.Purkiss, p. 116 The illicit means by which Pym acquired the notes caused a rift between the Vanes that healed only when the elder Vane eventually came to oppose the king.Adamson and Folland, p. 148 In the Root and Branch petition debate in the Commons, from December 1640 and into 1641, Vane supported, as did Nathaniel Fiennes, the call for radical reforms in the Church of England, a position that put Vane in opposition to his father.Ireland, p. 159 Amid a sea of complaints about church governance, he and Fiennes in February 1641 were added to a committee that had been established the previous November to draft a report on the state of the kingdom.Shaw, pp. 18‚Äì26,42 Their efforts led Vane to introduce the Root and Branch Bill in May 1641.Shaw, p. 99 The debate on the bill was acrimonious, and resulted in a clear indication of parliamentary support for church reform. In its wake mobs invaded churches, removing \\"scandalous images\\" and other signs of \\"popery\\".Adamson and Folland, p. 159 Vane made an impassioned speech that brought him to the front of his faction, claiming episcopacy (the governing structure of the Church of England) was a corrupt doctrine \\"hastening us back again to Rome.\\"Adamson and Folland, p. 157 The bill died without a vote in August, when more critical matters arose to occupy Parliament.Ireland, pp. 160,163 When Charles went to Scotland to rally Scottish forces to the royalist cause, the Commons began drafting what became known as the Grand Remonstrance. Many historians have claimed Vane had a role in drafting some of its language; this matter is disputed, but either way Vane did not participate in the debate.Adamson and Folland, p. 164 Narrowly passed by the Commons in November 1641, the document catalogued many grievances against the king and church, and served to further polarize political affairs.Ireland, p. 165 The king refused to enact any of the requested reforms. Upon his return from Scotland, the king also deprived both Vanes, father and son, of their administrative posts, in revenge for their roles in the execution of Strafford.Ireland, p. 166 Civil War =Early years= In the first six months of 1642, relations between the king and Parliament broke down completely, and factions supporting both sides took up arms. Parliament returned Vane to his post as Treasurer of the Navy, where he used connections to bring significant naval support to the Parliamentary side after Charles attempted to arrest five MPs on charges of high treason in December 1641.Adamson and Folland, pp. 169‚Äì176Ireland, p. 173 In June 1642 Charles rejected the Nineteen Propositions, the last substantive set of demands made by Parliament prior to the outbreak of the First English Civil War.Adamson and Folland, p. 173 After hostilities began that June with the Siege of Hull, Vane was given a seat on the Committee of Safety, which oversaw Parliamentary military activities.Adamson and Folland, p. 177 19th century depiction of the Westminster Assembly of Divines After the failure of the Root and Branch Bill, Parliament in 1643 called together the Westminster Assembly of Divines, a body of lay politicians, lords, and clergy whose purpose was to reform church governance.Moore, p. 323 Vane sat on this body, which met periodically until 1648, as one of the lay representatives of the Independent faction.Shaw, pp. 145‚Äì365Hosmer (1888), p. 172 Not long after its first meeting in July, Vane was sent at the head of a Parliamentary commission seeking military assistance from the Scots.Adamson and Folland, p. 193 The Scots, who had been opposed to Charles in the Bishop's Wars (1639‚Äì40) over religious issues,Adamson and Folland, pp. 134‚Äì140 were willing to assist the English Parliament if the latter were willing to allow the extension of the Presbyterian system of church polity to England.Hosmer (1888), p. 177 Vane was opposed to both Presbyterianism and Episcopalianism, but found a way to finesse an agreement.Adamson and Folland, p. 196 He proposed that the agreement, which covered a combination of religious and political topics, be called the Solemn League and Covenant, and he introduced slippery language into the agreement concerning \\"the example of the best Reformed churches\\". This language permitted the Scots to believe that their ideas would be adopted, while the English could interpret it to mean that English (i.e. Independent) practices could be adopted. The league and covenant were eventually approved by authorities in Scotland, England, and Ireland, and paved the way for Scottish entry into the war.Adamson and Folland, pp. 197‚Äì199 Following Vane's success in negotiating the Scottish agreement, the death of John Pym at the end of 1643 propelled Vane into the leadership of Parliament, along with Oliver St John, Henry Marten, and Arthur Heselrige.Adamson and Folland, pp. 202‚Äì209 He promoted, and became a chief member of, the Committee of Both Kingdoms, established in February 1644 as a point were English and Scottish authorities could coordinate war activities.Adamson and Folland, p. 214 Vane was then sent to York in June 1644, then besieged by three Parliament armies, to urge Sir Thomas Fairfax and the Earl of Manchester to divert some of those forces to face Prince Rupert of the Rhine, who had recently taken Liverpool and was pillaging properties of Parliamentary supporters in Lancashire.Ireland, pp. 226‚Äì227Adamson and Folland, p. 216 While there he also proposed to the generals the establishment of a government without the king. This idea was roundly rejected by the old guard generals who believed Charles could still be accommodated, but found support with the rising star of Oliver Cromwell.Ireland, p. 226Adamson and Folland, p. 217 On 13 September 1644 Vane acted with St John and Cromwell in the Commons to set up a \\"Grand Committee for the Accommodation\\", designed to find a compromise on religious issues dividing the Westminster Assembly. He sought in its debate to identify loopholes for religious tolerance on behalf of the Independents.Cliffe, pp. 109‚Äì110 This exposed Vane's opposition to Presbyterianism, and created a rift between the pro-war Independents, led by Vane and Cromwell, and the pro-peace Scots and other supporters of Presbyterianism.Adamson and Folland, pp. 222‚Äì223 The latter included the Earl of Essex, whose failures in the west of England reduced popular support for his cause, even as the military success of Cromwell at Marston Moor raised his profile.Ireland, pp. 236‚Äì237Adamson and Folland, p. 220 Robert Baillie, on the realization that the Parliamentary Independents, despite previous claims of support by Vane, were not on the side of the Scots, wrote \\"Sir Henry Vane and The Solicitor [St John]... without any regard for us, who have saved their nation and brought their two persons to the height of power now they enjoy and use to our prejudice\\".Adamson and Folland, p. 223 =Parliamentary victory= Overtures for peace talks were begun in November 1644 between king and Parliament. Vane was one of many negotiators sent to Uxbridge in a failed attempt to negotiate peace.Ireland, pp. 245‚Äì246 Vane and the Independents were seen by some as a principal reason for the failure of these talks, because the Scots and Charles were prepared to agree on issues of church polity and doctrine and the Independents were not.Adamson and Folland, p. 230 The talks, which lasted from late January through most of February 1645, were overshadowed by the execution after impeachment by attainder of Archbishop Laud.Ireland, pp. 246‚Äì248 John Lilburne advocated for expanded civil rights, and was a vocal critic of Vane. Parliament began discussing a reorganization of its military as early as November 1644, in part to remove some poorly-performing commanders, and to eliminate the regional character of the existing forces.Adamson and Folland, p. 229 In debate that principally divided the Commons from the Lords, Vane and Cromwell supported passage of the Self-denying Ordinance, forbidding military officers from serving in Parliament, and the establishment of the New Model Army, which would be capable of fighting anywhere in the country.Ireland, pp. 254‚Äì256 The provisions of the Self-denying Ordinance also extended to individuals (like Vane) who held civil service posts, but included exceptions for those (like Vane) who had been turned out office by Charles and restored by Parliament.Adamson and Folland, pp. 232‚Äì233 Vane then began drawing on fees and stipends that he had previously refused, and failed to pay half of his treasurer's fees to Parliament, as required by the law.Adamson and Folland, p. 233 Following the decisive Parliamentary victory at Naseby in June 1645, the first phase of the civil war was effectively over, but it dragged on for another year,Adamson and Folland, p. 235 before Charles surrendered to Scottish army commanders.Ireland, p. 271 During this time, a new political faction began to rise within the military. Known as Levellers and led by John Lilburne and others, this populist force was in favour of greater press freedoms, and was opposed to at least some of the privileges of the aristocracy, including the existence of the House of Lords.Adamson and Folland, p. 237 In January 1646, amid ongoing peace negotiations, Charles attempted to separate the Independents from other factions by proposing in letters to Vane an alliance with his faction against the Presbyterians.Adamson and Folland, p. 240 Vane was not amused by this, and responded by pointing out that he preferred the rights of \\"tender consciences\\" to be granted by Parliament rather than by the duplicitous king (papers exposing the king's negotiating positions as facades had been captured at Naseby, and had largely silenced the Royalist elements in Parliament).Ireland, p. 266 The Vane estates were not spared in the maelstrom of war; Vane's father reported that Raby Castle had been \\"visited four times\\", suffering damages of ¬£16,000.Ireland, pp. 243‚Äì244 In September 1645, the Vanes succeeded in getting Parliamentary approval to fortify Raby.Adamson and Folland, p. 238 =Interwar politics= Vane supported Oliver Cromwell during the Civil War, but fell out with him later. By the end of the war the Presbyterian group in the Commons, led by Denzil Holles, William Strode, and Sir Philip Stapleton, was slightly stronger than the Independents.Smith, p. 153 They proceeded to introduce legislation hostile to the views on religious tolerance held by Vane and Independents in the army. Vane apparently came to realize that the Presbyterian actions posed a threat equal to that of the Episcopalians, and that military action, having sidelined the latter, might also work against the former. There was also mutual distrust between Vane and the Levellers, because Vane held the somewhat aristocratic view that voting rights should be reserved to the propertied gentry.Adamson and Folland, pp. 243‚Äì254 The Independents attempted to negotiate terms favourable to them with Charles, but these were unsuccessful.Adamson and Folland, p. 243 In 1647 Vane and Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the army's Independents, came to work closely together. The Presbyterian majority sought to disband the army to reduce the threat of those Independents, but issues over pay (which was in arrears), widows' pensions, and other grievances, prompted the Presbyterians to enter into negotiations with the army. A bitter debate over an army petition led Levellers to charge the Independents, Vane among them, with attempting to \\"oppress the people\\" and wanting to \\"hold the reins of power ... not for a year, but forever.\\"Adamson and Folland, p. 251 Cromwell was eventually able to appease the army, but a Parliamentary purge of Independent officers followed, and the army was ordered to disband. Some Parliamentary leaders also began negotiating with the Scots for the return of their army, this time to oppose the English army.Adamson and Folland, p. 252 The Parliament army mutinied, and under Cromwell's orders (possibly prompted by a warning from Vane) a detachment of troops seized Charles, who had been placed under a comfortable house arrest at Holmby. This forced the Presbyterian leadership to meet the army's demands for pay. They also established a commission to treat with the army, on which they placed Vane, presumably because of his influence with the military.Ireland, pp. 284‚Äì285Adamson and Folland, pp. 253‚Äì254 The negotiations between the army and Parliament were acrimonious. Mobs in Presbyterian-dominated London threatened Vane and other Independents. More than 50 Independent MPs, Vane among them, fled the city on 2 August for the protection of the army. The army then marched on London, with Vane and others at its head, and the Independents were again seated in Parliament.Hosmer (1888), pp. 269‚Äì270 The Parliament then debated the army's Heads of Proposals for fixing the term and powers of Parliament and church governance. Key among its terms of interest to Vane was one that effectively stripped the church, either Episcopal or Presbyterian, of any coercive powers.Adamson and Folland, p. 261 The Heads of Proposals was also sent to Charles, who indicated agreement to some of its terms and opposition to others, and proposed further negotiations.Adamson and Folland, p. 263 The king's proposal split the Independents between those, such as Vane and Cromwell, who were willing to negotiate with the king, and those who were not. Reverend Hugh Peter spoke out in favor of the \\"non-addresses\\" (i.e. no longer negotiating with the king), as did the Levellers. John Lilburne was particularly critical, saying \\"I clearly see Cromwell's and Vane's designs, which is to keep the poor people everlastingly (if they can) in bondage and slavery.\\"Adamson and Folland, p. 264 In November 1647, while the debate continued, Charles escaped his confinement at Hampton Court and made his way to the Isle of Wight. There he was recaptured and imprisoned in Carisbrook Castle.Ireland, p. 287 Offered proposals by the Scots and the Independents, he chose alliance with the Scots. Sectional violence between royalists, Presbyterians, and Independents, spread throughout the country, although the army maintained a tenuous peace in London.Adamson and Folland, p. 265 =War renewed= Violence flared throughout the country as the various factions armed and organized. A mutiny in the Royal Navy in May thrust Vane into attempts to prevent it from spreading, and to regain the support of the mutineers, who had declared for Charles. By mid-July, the army had regained control of most of England, and Cromwell defeated the Scottish army in August at the Battle of Preston. In the tumult, Vane appeared at times to be in opposition to some of the Independent factions, even having a falling out (quickly healed) with Cromwell, and many factions came to distrust him. Despite this he was one of the Parliamentary representatives for negotiations with Charles at Newport in September 1648. He was widely blamed for the failure of those negotiations over his insistence on \\"an unbounded liberty of conscience\\".Adamson and Folland, p. 274 Colonel Pride refusing admission to the Presbyterian members of the Long Parliament (Pride's Purge). In the debates of late 1648 concerning the king's fate, Vane argued that the Parliament should constitute a government without the king \\"to make themselves the happiest nation and people in the world.\\"Adamson and Folland, p. 276 His forceful speech on 2 December suggesting that the king would need to be eliminated as a political force was opposed by others, including Nathaniel Fiennes, who claimed that the concessions the king had made to date were sufficient that an agreement might be reached. Others suggested that rather than dividing the house by opposition to the king, it be divided by separating those who had gained in the war from those who had not, and that financial contributions be made from one group to the other.Adamson and Folland, p. 277 After an impassioned conciliatory speech by William Prynne, Parliament finally voted on 5 December that the king's concessions were sufficient, but Clement Walker and other opponents of Vane whispered that both Vanes had abused their positions of power during the war for profit. Walker compiled a long list of MPs he claimed had acted corruptly, but Vane was not on it. Instead, Walker charged the Vanes with benefiting by buying at a discount \\"sleeping pensions\\", or debts owed by the public purse to individuals, and then pursuing payment of them to enrich themselves. There is today no substantive way to assess the validity of Walker's charges.Adamson and Folland, pp. 278‚Äì280 On 6 December, the military stepped in to take control of matters. Troops led by Thomas Pride surrounded the Houses of Parliament, and systematically arrested arriving MPs who had been supportive of negotiation with the king. Vane did not appear that day; either he was aware of what was going to happen, or he may have stayed away because his side had lost the vote.Adamson and Folland, p. 281 This action, known as \\"Pride's Purge\\", resulted in the exclusion of more than 140 MPs.Adamson and Folland, pp. 282‚Äì283 The Parliament that sat became known as the Rump Parliament, and its first main order of business was the trial and execution of King Charles. During this process Vane refused to attend Parliament, although he was present as a spectator when the trial began on 20 January 1649.Adamson and Folland, p. 284 He later claimed to oppose putting the king on trial because of \\"tenderness of blood\\", and continued to fulfill the duties of his government posts, signing admiralty papers on the day Charles was executed.Adamson and Folland, p. 291 The Commonwealth and Oliver Cromwell After the execution of Charles, the House of Commons voted to abolish both the crown and the House of Lords.Ireland, p. 298 To replace the executive functions of the crown, it established a Council of State to which Vane was appointed. He refused to be seated until he could do so without taking any oath, in particular the first one, which required an expression of approval for the regicide.Adamson and Folland, pp. 292‚Äì293 Vane served on many of the council's committees. On 1 August 1650 he was named president of the first Commission of Trade established by an Act of Parliament.August 1650: An Act for the Advancing and Regulating of the Trade of this Commonwealth. The commission's instructions were to consider, both domestic and foreign trade, the trading companies, manufactures, free ports, customs, excise, statistics, coinage and exchange, and fisheries, but also the plantations and the best means of promoting their welfare and rendering them useful to England. This act's statesmanlike and comprehensive instructions, along with an October act prohibiting trade with pro-royalist colonies and the first Navigation Act of the following year, formed the first definitive expression of England's commercial policy.Charles M. Andrews, British Committees, Commissions and Councils of Trade and Plantations 1622-1675 , Chapter II, Control of Trade and Plantations During the Interregnum, p.24 (1908) In his role on committees overseeing the military he directed the provisioning of supplies for Cromwell's conquest of Ireland.Adamson and Folland, p. 296 As a leading member of the committee overseeing the navy (where he was joined by schoolmate Thomas Scot), he directed affairs in the naval First Anglo-Dutch War (1652‚Äì1654).Brenner, p. 582 After the navy's disastrous performance against the Dutch in 1652, Vane headed the committee that reformed the navy, drafting new Articles of War and formally codifying naval law. Vane's reforms were instrumental in the navy's successes later in the war.Adamson and Folland, p. 312 He was also involved in foreign diplomacy, going on a mission to France (whose purpose is unknown) in 1652 to meet with Cardinal de Retz,Adamson and Folland, p. 310 and traveling again to Scotland to organize the government there after Cromwell's victories in the Third English Civil War.Ireland, pp. 321‚Äì322 Cromwell dissolving Parliament on 20 April 1653 Vane was also active in domestic affairs. He sat on a committee that disposed of Charles I's art collection, and made many enemies in his role on the committees for Compounding and Sequestration.Adamson and Folland, p. 293 These committees, on which Vane had also sat in the 1640s, were responsible for the distribution of assets seized from royalists and other government opponents, and for negotiating with those who had failed to pay taxes and other government charges. Some of the enemies he made while engaged in this work would one day sit in judgment against him.Adamson and Folland, pp. 240‚Äì242 The process by which the Parliament carried out the duties of the executive was cumbersome, and this became an issue with Cromwell and the army, who sought the ability to act more decisively.Adamson and Folland, p. 314 This attitude drove a wedge between Cromwell and Vane.Adamson and Folland, p. 313 Under pressure from Cromwell for new elections, the Parliament began to consider proposals for electoral reform. In January 1653 a committee headed by Vane made one such proposal.Aylmer, p. 15 It called for suffrage to be allowed on the basis of property ownership, and it sought specifically to eliminate some so-called \\"rotten boroughs\\", which had small numbers of voters and were controlled by wealthy patrons.Ireland, p. 341 The proposal also called for some of the current members, whose republican credentials were deemed suitable, to retain their seats, so that the fledgling commonwealth might, as Harry Marten put it, be shepherded by \\"the mother that brought it forth\\".Ireland, p. 340 This latter clause was proposed specifically at the urging of the army by Vane, who realised that those who were charged with its implementation would be able to retain power. However, Cromwell, seeking a general election, was opposed to this scheme, and the two sides were unable to reconcile.Adamson and Folland, p. 315 Although Parliamentary leaders, Vane among them, had promised Cromwell on 19 April 1653 to delay action on the election bill, Vane was likely one of the ringleaders who sought to have the bill enacted the next day before Cromwell could react. Cromwell was however alerted by a supporter, and interrupted the proceedings that would otherwise have passed the bill. Bringing troops into the chamber, he put an end to the debate, saying \\"You are no Parliament. I say you are no Parliament. I will put an end to your sitting.\\"Ireland, p. 350 Vane protested, \\"This is not honest; yea, it is against morality and common honesty\\", to which Cromwell shouted in response, \\"O Sir Henry Vane, Sir Henry Vane; the Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane!\\" This ended the commonwealth, and Cromwell began to rule as Lord Protector. Vane, \\"daily missed and courted for his assistance\\", was invited to sit on Cromwell's council, but refused.Adamson and Folland, p. 319 Effectively in retirement, Vane wrote the Retired Man's Meditations, published in 1655 amid rumors that Vane was fomenting rebellion against Cromwell, principally among Quakers and Fifth Monarchists.Adamson and Folland, p. 325 This work, a jargon- laden religious treatise in which Vane wanders between literal and symbolic interpretation of Biblical scriptures, was treated by contemporaries and later analysts, including David Hume, as \\"absolutely unintelligible\\" and \\"cloudily formed\\".Adamson and Folland, pp. 325‚Äì326 The same year, after Cromwell called for a fast day to consider methods by which his government might be improved, Vane wrote A Healing Question.Ireland, pp. 373‚Äì374 In this more carefully structured political work, he proposed a new form of government, insisting as before upon a Parliament supreme over the Army. He was encouraged to publish it by Charles Fleetwood,Worden, p. 312 who had shown it to Cromwell.Ireland, p. 374 In a postscript to the work Vane wrote the words \\"the good old cause\\", a coinage that became a rallying cry in the next few years for Vane's group of republicans.Woolrych, p. 715 The gate to Carisbrook Castle, where Vane was imprisoned in 1656 A Healing Question was seen by John Thurloe, Cromwell's Secretary of State, as a thinly-veiled attack on Cromwell, and its publication prompted a number of opposition political groups to step up their activities.Adamson and Folland, p. 341 Rumors circulated that protests raised by fringe religious groups like the Anabaptists and Quakers were due to Vane's involvement, prompting Cromwell's council to issue an order on 29 July 1656, summoning Vane to appear.Adamson and Folland, p. 344 Vane was ordered to post a bond of ¬£5,000 \\"to do nothing to the prejudice of the present government and the peace of the Commonwealth\\", but refused. He was arrested shortly afterward and imprisoned in Carisbrooke Castle.Auchter, p. 138Adamson and Folland, pp. 344‚Äì345 While there he addressed a letter to Cromwell in which he repudiated the extra-parliamentary authority Cromwell had assumed. Vane was released, still unrepentant, on 31 December 1656.Adamson and Folland, p. 347 During Vane's retirement he established a religious teaching group, which resulted in a group of admirers known as \\"Vanists\\".Bremer and Webster, p. 257 The Puritan pastor Richard Baxter classified Seekers, Ranters, Behmenists and Vanists together, as religious wild men.Orme, p. 1:81 He also cultivated pamphleteers and other surrogates to promote his political views. Henry Stubbe, introduced to Vane by Westminster head Richard Busby, became a supporter, and defended him in his Essay in Defence of the Good Old Cause, and in Malice Rebuked (1659).Peacey, p. 82Cooper and Hunter, p. 223 Richard Cromwell and after Following Oliver Cromwell's death in September 1658, his son Richard succeeded him as Lord Protector.Ireland, pp. 388,392 The younger Cromwell lacked the political and military skills of his father, and the political factionalism of the earlier Commonwealth began to resurface.Ireland, pp. 392‚Äì393 When elections were called for a new parliament in December 1658, Cromwell attempted to prevent the election of both royalists and republicans.Ireland, p. 393Coward, p. 107 Vane, as a leader of the republican faction, was specifically targeted, but managed to win election representing Whitchurch.Ireland, pp. 393‚Äì394 In the parliament's session, the republicans questioned Cromwell's claim to power, argued in favour of limiting it, and spoke against the veto power of the Cromwellian House of Lords, which was packed with supporters of the protector.Ireland, p. 395 The republicans were unsuccessful in enacting any substantive changes.Coward, p. 108 John Lambert Vane formed an alliance with a group of republican military officers known as the Wallingford House party, who met secretly in violation of laws enacted to limit military participation in political matters.Ireland, p. 402 The Cromwellian factions in the parliament overreached in their attempts to control republican sentiment in the military, and Cromwell was forced to dissolve the parliament in April 1659.Coward, pp. 110‚Äì111 Cromwell, with little support in the military, abdicated several days later.Ireland, p. 403 Following a purge of pro-Cromwell supporters from the military and a widespread pamphleteering campaign, Cromwell's council recalled the Rump Parliament in May.Coward, p. 112 In the reconstituted Rump Parliament, Vane was appointed to the new council of state. He also served as commissioner for the appointment of army officers, managed foreign affairs, and examined the state of the government's finances, which were found to be in dismal condition.Ireland, pp. 407‚Äì408, 415 Through his work General John Lambert was sent to quell Booth's Rebellion, a royalist uprising in August 1659.Ireland, p. 415 Lambert's support of non-mainstream religious views like Quakerism, however, ensured his political downfall.Farr, p. 184 After he and other officers were stripped of their command by Parliament in October, they rallied their troops and marched on Parliament, forcibly dissolving it.Farr, p. 197 A committee of safety was formed, composed of the army grandees, and including Vane. He agreed to serve in part because he feared the republican cause was destined to fail without army support.Ireland, p. 418 This committee served only until December, when the advance of General George Monck's army from Scotland led to the melting away of Lambert's military support, and the restoration of the full Long Parliament. For taking part in the committee of safety, Vane was expelled (over vocal objections from allies like Heselrige) from the Commons, and ordered into house arrest at Raby Castle.Ireland, p. 422Adamson and Folland, p. 414 He went to Raby in February 1660, but stayed there only briefly and eventually returned to his house at Hampstead.Adamson and Folland, pp. 415,423 During the tumultuous year of the late 1650s proposals for how the government should be structured and how powers should be balanced were widely debated, in private, in public debates in Parliament, and through the publication of pamphlets. Vane used all of these methods to promote his ideas. In 1660 he published A Needful Corrective or Balance in Popular Government. This open letter was essentially a response to James Harrington's The Commonwealth of Oceana, a 1656 treatise describing Harrington's view of a utopian government, which included limitations on property ownership and a legislature with an elected upper chamber.Ireland, p. 412 Harrington's thesis was that power arose from property ownership, and concentrated land ownership led to oligarchic and monarchic forms of government.Ireland, p. 411 Vane disagreed with this, arguing instead that power came from godliness, and presented a somewhat apocalyptic argument in support of his idea.Parnham, pp. 43‚Äì46 Vane supporter Henry Stubbe stated openly in October 1659 that permanent Senators would be required. These proposals caused a terminal split in Vane's alliance with Heselrige, whose followers mostly deserted Vane.Woolrych, Austin, \\"Last Quests for a Settlement: 1657‚Äì1660\\", p. 197, in Aylmer (ed), The Interregnum (1972). The Restoration In March 1660 the Long Parliament finally dissolved itself, and elections were held for the Convention Parliament, which sat in May. This body, dominated by royalists and Presbyterians, formally proclaimed Charles II as king, and he was restored to the throne on 29 May 1660.Adamson and Folland, p. 422 In order to minimize acts of reprisal and vengeance for acts taken during the Interregnum, the parliament passed the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, under whose terms most actions were forgiven. Specific exceptions were made for those directly involved in the regicide, and after long debate, Vane was also named as an exception. The act was not passed until August 1660, and Vane was arrested on 1 July 1660 on the orders of the king and imprisoned in the Tower of London.Adamson and Folland, pp. 422‚Äì425 The parliament, after passing the Indemnity Act, petitioned Charles to grant clemency to Vane and others, asking that his life might be spared. This petition was granted.Adamson and Folland, p. 426 Despite the clemency, Vane remained in the Tower, and the income from his estates was seized. He suffered the privations of the prison, and was unable to discharge debts that ran to ¬£10,000. He was transferred to the Isles of Scilly in October 1661 in order to limit access to him by potential conspirators who might be scheming to free him.Ireland, p. 453Adamson and Folland, p. 437 He continued to write, principally on religious themes, seeking to come to terms with the political state of affairs and his condition.Ireland, p. 454 According to The People's Case Stated, written by Vane in this time, power originated with God, but resided primarily with the people: \\"The power which is directive, and states and ascertains the morality of the rule of obedience, is in the hand of God; but the original, from whence all just power arises, which is magistratical and co-ercitive, is from the will or free gift of the people, who may either keep the power in themselves or give up their subjection and will in the hand of another.\\" King and people were bound by \\"the fundamental constitution or compact\\", which if the king violated, the people might return to their original right and freedom.Yorke, p. 893 Following Vane's move to Scilly, the Cavalier Parliament passed a resolution in November 1661 demanding his return to the Tower for trial. Charles temporized, and in January 1662 the Parliament renewed the demand.Adamson and Folland, p. 438 Vane was moved back to the Tower in April 1662, and on 2 June 1662 he was arraigned on charges of high treason against Charles II.Hosmer (1888), pp. 510Adamson and Folland, p. 448 The trial began on 6 June before the Court of King's Bench, with four judges headed by Lord Chief Justice Robert Foster presiding, and with the king's attorney general Sir Geoffrey Palmer prosecuting.Adamson and Folland, p. 456 As was typical of those accused of treason, Vane was denied legal representation. He defended himself against charges of making war against the king during the civil war by asserting the sovereign power of parliament. Accused of imagining the death of the king in 1659, he argued that it was not possible to commit treason against a king not in possession of the crown. When the prosecution argued that the king was always in de jure possession, Vane pointed out that this rendered invalid the charges that he conspired to keep Charles II from exercising his power. The judges stepped in to point out this was irrelevant.Adamson and Folland, pp. 456‚Äì461 The jury, which was packed with royalists, convicted him after thirty minutes of debate.Ireland, p. 465Adamson and Folland, p. 461 Vane attempted to appeal his conviction, and tried to get the magistrates to sign a Bill of Exclusion in which Vane catalogued all the problems he saw with his trial. However, the magistrates refused. Informed of Vane's conduct before and during the trial,Adamson and Folland, p. 466 Charles II now felt that Vane was too dangerous a man to be left alive, and retracted his clemency.Shifflett, p. 98Robertson, p. 348 (Unlike Vane, John Lambert at his trial had thrown himself on the mercy of the court, and was consequently exiled to Guernsey after his conviction.) Although Vane had been sentenced to the commoner's death of being hanged and then drawn and quartered, Charles was persuaded to grant him the gentleman's death of beheading.Adamson and Folland, pp. 465,467 On 14 June 1662 Vane was taken to Tower Hill and beheaded. Noted diarist Samuel Pepys was there and recorded the event:Pepys, p. 4:241 : In his final days Vane had made his peace with God, and had also carefully prepared the speech he intended to make at the execution.Adamson and Folland, pp. 467‚Äì469 In order to preserve the speech, he gave copies to close friends who visited him in those days, which were later printed.Adamson and Folland, p. 478 Many viewed him as a martyr for continuing to espouse his cause, and some thought the king had lost more than he gained by having him executed. His body was returned to his family, who interred him in the church at Shipbourne, near the family estate of Fairlawn in Kent.Adamson and Folland, p. 477 Family Vane and his wife Frances had ten children. Of their five sons, only the last, Christopher, had children, and succeeded to his father's estates. He was created Baron Barnard by William III.Ireland, p. 497 Works Statue in Boston Public Library Marker under the statue A number of Vane's speeches to Parliament and other bodies were printed during his lifetime or shortly after, including The Speech Intended to Have been Spoken on the Scaffold, published in 1662.Adamson and Folland, p. 481 Vane's other printed works include:Adamson and Folland, p. 482 * A Brief Answer to a Certain Declaration, 1637 * The Retired Man's Meditations, 1655 * A Healing Question Propounded, 1656 * Of Love of God and Union with God, 1657? * The Proceeds of the Protector ... Against Sir Henry Vane, Knight, 1658 * A Needful Corrective or Balance in Popular Government, 1659 * Two Treatises: \\"Epistle General to the Mystical Body of Christ\\" and \\"The Face of the Times\\", 1662 * The Cause of the People of England Stated, 1689 (written 1660‚Äì1662; the title may have been intended to be \\"Case\\" instead of \\"Cause\\") * A Pilgrimage into the Land of Promise, 1664 * The Trial of Sir Henry Vane, Knight, 1662 The last work contains, in addition to his last speech and details relating to the trial, The People's Case Stated, The Valley of Jehoshaphat, and Meditations concerning Man's Life.Yorke, p. 894 Some contemporary works were incorrectly attributed to him. Clarendon, in his History of the Rebellion, assigns to Vane credit for one speech in support of the Self-Denying Ordinance; later historians find this attribution spurious. The Speech against Richard Cromwell is probably the composition of a later writer, while The Light Shining out of Darkness may have been written by Henry Stubbe. Reputation Vane was widely recognized by contemporary chroniclers as a gifted administrator and a forceful orator. Even the royalist Clarendon had good words for him, and wrote of him as follows: \\"He had an unusual aspect, which ... made men think there was something in him of the extraordinary; and his whole life made good that imagination.\\" Also, Clarendon credited Vane with having possessed \\"extraordinary parts, a pleasant wit, a great understanding, a temper not to be moved\\", and in debate \\"a quick conception and a very sharp and weighty expression\\". The 1662 biography The Life and Death of Sir Henry Vane the Younger by Vane's chaplain George Sikes included John Milton's \\"Sonnet 17\\", written in 1652 in praise of Vane, and presented to Vane that year.Lewalski, p. 287 The religious writings of Vane were so unusual as to have been found difficult to understand, even baffling, by readers as varied as Richard Baxter, Clarendon, Gilbert Burnet and David Hume, and continue to be seen so today.Freeman and Mayer, p. 223 Civil War historian Blair Worden comments that \\"Vane's opaque political ideas and religious beliefs are now barely intelligible\\",Worden, p. 363 and biographer David Parnham writes \\"He presented himself as a 'witness' of light, as a spiritualist, as one dispensing advanced wisdoms in the epistemological setting of an imminent and apocalyptic age of the Spirit\\".Parnham, p. 12 Vane's reputation was at its height in the nineteenth century, especially in the United States. English historian John Andrew Doyle wrote of Vane that he had acquired \\"a more dazzling reputation than has been granted to the lofty public spirit and statesmanlike foresight of Winthrop.\\"Doyle, p. 169 William Wordsworth referenced Vane in his sonnet Great Men Have Been Among Us (1802). Charles Dickens included the exchange between Vane and Cromwell at the end of the Rump Parliament in his A Child's History of England, part-published in the early 1850s.Dickens, p. 267 In English Traits (1856), Ralph Waldo Emerson placed Vane on a list of historical English greats. Sean Gabb, a modern British libertarian, notes that Vane was in the vanguard on issues of religious freedom. Although he was \\"among a small and easily defeated minority\\", his successors 150 years later \\"were responsible for the clearest and most solid safeguards of civil and religious freedom ever adopted into a constitution.\\" In 1897 the Royal Society of the Arts marked Vane's demolished Hampstead house on Rosslyn Hill, Vane House, with a blue plaque. James Kendall Hosmer, editing Winthrop's Journal in 1908, wrote of Vane: > ... his heroic life and death, his services to Anglo-Saxon freedom, which > make him a significant figure even to the present moment, may well be > regarded as the most illustrious character who touches early New England > history. While his personal contact with America was only for a brief space, > his life became a strenuous upholding of American ideas: if government of, > by, and for the people is the principle which English-speaking men feel > especially bound to maintain, the life and death of Vane contributed > powerfully to cause this idea to prevail.Hosmer (1908), p. 161 Notes References          Further reading The literature on the English Civil War, Commonwealth and Protectorate is immense, and Vane has been a regular subject for biographers in the 19th and 20th centuries. * Contemporary history of the Civil War and Interregnum by a royalist. * Ten volume history covering 17th century England up to the Civil War. * Three volume history of the English Civil War. * Three volume history of the Commonwealth and Protectorate.

He served in the Mediterranean theater as a radio operator/gunner on Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers with the 772nd Bombardment Squadron, 463d Operations Group of the Fifteenth Air Force; he also described bombing Germany in the European theater. Lear flew 52 combat missions, for which he was awarded the Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters. Lear was discharged from the Army in 1945, and his fellow World War II crew members are featured in the books Crew Umbriag, by Daniel P. Carroll (tail gunner), and 772nd Bomb Squadron: The Men, The Memories, by Turner Publishing and Co.  Career  After World War II, Lear had a career in public relations. The career choice was inspired by his Uncle Jack: \\"My dad had a brother, Jack, who flipped me a quarter every time he saw me. He was a press agent so I wanted to be a press agent. That's the only role model I had. So all I wanted was to grow up to be a guy who could flip a quarter to a nephew.\\" Lear decided to move to California to restart his career in publicity, driving with his toddler daughter across the country. His first night in Los Angeles, Lear stumbled upon a production of George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara at a 90-seat theater in the round Circle Theater off Sunset Boulevard. One of the actors in the play was Sydney Chaplin, who was the son of actors Charlie Chaplin and Lita Grey. Chaplin, Alan Mowbray and Dame Gladys Cooper sat in front of him, and after the show was over, Chaplin performed. Lear had a first cousin in Los Angeles, Elaine, married to Ed Simmons, who wanted to be a comedy writer. Simmons and Lear teamed up to sell home furnishings door-to-door for a company called The Gans Brothers and later sold family photos door-to-door. Throughout the 1950s, Lear and Simmons turned out comedy sketches for television appearances of Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, and others. They frequently wrote for Martin and Lewis when they appeared on the Colgate Comedy Hour and a 1953 article from Billboard magazine stated that Lear and Simmons were guaranteed a record-breaking $52,000 each to write for five additional Martin and Lewis appearances on the Colgate Comedy Hour that year. In a 2015 interview with Vanity Magazine Lear said that Jerry Lewis had hired him and Simmons to become writers for Martin and Lewis three weeks before the comedy duo made their first appearance on the Colgate Comedy Hour in 1950. Lear also acknowledged in 1986 that he and Simmons were the main writers for The Martin and Lewis Show for three years. In 1954 Lear was enlisted as a writer hoping to salvage the new Celeste Holm CBS sitcom, Honestly, Celeste!, but the program was canceled after eight episodes. During this time, he became the producer of NBC's short-lived (26 episodes) sitcom The Martha Raye Show, after Nat Hiken left as the series director. Lear also wrote some of the opening monologues for The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show, which aired from 1956 to 1961. In 1959 Lear created his first television series, a half-hour western for Revue Studios called The Deputy, starring Henry Fonda. = 1970s = Starting out as a comedy writer, then a film director (he wrote and produced the 1967 film Divorce American Style and directed the 1971 film Cold Turkey, both starring Dick Van Dyke), Lear tried to sell a concept for a sitcom about a blue-collar American family to ABC. They rejected the show after two pilots were taped: Justice For All in 1968 and Those Were The Days in 1969. After a third pilot was taped, CBS picked up the show, known as All in the Family. It premiered January 12, 1971, to disappointing ratings, but it took home several Emmy Awards that year, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The show did very well in summer reruns, and it flourished in the 1971‚Äì72 season, becoming the top-rated show on TV for the next five years. After falling from the #1 spot, All in the Family still remained in the top ten, well after it transitioned into Archie Bunker's Place. The show was based loosely on the British sitcom Till Death Us Do Part, about an irascible working-class Tory and his Socialist son-in-law. Lear's second big TV sitcom was also based on a British sitcom, Steptoe and Son, about a west London junk dealer and his son. Lear changed the setting to the Watts section of Los Angeles and the characters to African-Americans, and the NBC show Sanford and Son was an instant hit. Numerous hit shows followed thereafter, including Maude, The Jeffersons (as with Maude a spin-off of All in the Family), One Day at a Time, and Good Times (which was a spinoff of Maude). What most of the Lear sitcoms had in common was that they were shot on videotape in place of film, used a live studio audience, and dealt with the social and political issues of the day. Maude, while reputedly based on Lear's wife, was actually the brainchild of series writer Charlie Hauck; however, Frances herself would acknowledge that the show's title character was based on her. Lear's longtime producing partner was Bud Yorkin, who also produced All in the Family, Sanford and Son, What's Happening!!, Maude, and The Jeffersons. Yorkin split with Lear in 1975. He started a production company with writer/producers Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein, but they had only two shows that ran more than a year: What's Happening!! and Carter Country. The Lear/Yorkin company was known as Tandem Productions that was founded in 1958. Lear and talent agent Jerry Perenchio founded T.A.T. Communications (T.A.T. stood for \\"Tuchus Affen Tisch\\", which is Yiddish for \\"Putting one's butt on the line\\") in 1974, which co-existed with Tandem Productions and was often referred to in periodicals as Tandem/T.A.T. The Lear organization was one of the most successful independent TV producers of the 1970s. TAT produced the influential and award-winning 1981 film The Wave about Ron Jones' social experiment. Lear also developed the cult favorite TV series Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (MH MH) which was turned down by the networks as \\"too controversial\\" and placed it into first run syndication with 128 stations in January 1976. A year later, Lear added another program into first-run syndication along with MH MH, All That Glitters. He planned in 1977 to offer three hours of prime-time Saturday programming directly, with the stations placing his production company in the position of an occasional network. = 1980s = In 1980, Lear founded the organization People for the American Way for the purpose of counteracting the Christian right organization Moral Majority, founded in 1979. In the fall of 1981, Lear began a 14-month run as the host of a revival of the classic game show Quiz Kids for the CBS Cable Network. In January 1982, Lear and Jerry Perenchio bought out Avco Embassy Pictures from Avco Financial Corporation, and the Avco part of its name was dropped after merging that with T.A.T. Communications Company to form Embassy Communications, Inc. Embassy Pictures was led by Alan Horn and Martin Schaeffer, later co-founders of Castle Rock Entertainment with Rob Reiner. In March 1982, Lear produced an ABC television special titled I Love Liberty, which was aimed to counterbalance groups like the Moral Majority.https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/19/arts/tv-weekend-lear-s-i-love- liberty-leads-specials.html?mcubz=3 Among the many guests who appeared on the special was conservative icon and the 1964 US presidential election's Republican nominee Barry Goldwater. Even before the special aired, it was revealed that I Love Liberty had obtained even more public hype than the CBS documentary Central American In Revolt, which aired the day before Lear's special and was meant to hype the Reagan Administration's policy surrounding the Central American crisis. On June 18, 1985, Lear and Perenchio sold Embassy Communications to Columbia Pictures (then owned by the Coca-Cola Company), which acquired Embassy's film and television division (including Embassy's in- house television productions and the television rights to the Embassy theatrical library) for $485 million in shares of The Coca-Cola Company. Lear and Perenchio split the net proceeds (about $250 million). Coke later sold the film division to Dino De Laurentiis and the home video arm to Nelson Holdings (led by Barry Spikings). In his book Even This I Get To Experience, Lear stated that he was the one who produced the four-day Liberty Weekend special which aired during the 1986 Fourth of July Weekend and that he was also the one who was used the Israeli ship The Galaxy which set sail during the event. Lear also stated that he used The Galaxy to host a private party celebrating his upcoming marriage to his fianc√©e Lyn and that he in part made the special so it was coincide with this party as well. He also stated that it was his close family, friends and associates who were occupying the ship with him and Lyn and watching the event via closed-circuit TV. The brand Tandem Productions was abandoned in 1986 with the cancellation of Diff'rent Strokes, and Embassy ceased to exist as a single entity in late 1986, having been split into different components owned by different entities. The Embassy TV division became ELP Communications in 1988, but shows originally produced by Embassy were now under the Columbia Pictures Television banner from 1988 to 1996 and the Columbia TriStar Television banner from 1996 to 2002. Lear's Act III Communications, founded in 1986 with Tom McGrath as president, produced several notable films, including Rob Reiner's next three films: The Sure Thing, Stand By Me, and The Princess Bride, as well as Fried Green Tomatoes. On February 2, 1989, Norman Lear's Act III Communications formed a joint venture with Columbia Pictures Television called Act III Television to produce television series instead of managing. = 1990s = Lear attempted to return to TV production in the 1990s with the shows Sunday Dinner, The Powers That Be, and 704 Hauser, the last one putting a different family in the house from All in the Family. None of the series proved successful. Lear's Act III Communications was founded in 1986 and led initially by Tom McGrath, who met Lear while negotiating on behalf of Coca-Cola the acquisition of Lear's old company, and later by Hal Gaba, a former Embassy Pictures executive. This included: Act III Theatres, sold to KKR in 1997; Act III Broadcasting, sold to Abry Communications; and Act III Publishing, sold to PriMedia. Lear is also the owner of Concord Records, and in 2005 consummated a 50% interest in the film library and production assets of Village Roadshow Productions Pty Ltd. In 1997, Lear and Jim George produced the Kids' WB series Channel Umptee-3. It premiered on October 25, 1997. The cartoon was the first to meet the Federal Communications Commission's then-new educational/informal programming requirements. It received positive reviews, but ratings were low and it was eventually canceled after one season, with the finale airing September 4, 1998. = 2000s = In 2003, Lear made an appearance on South Park during the \\"I'm a Little Bit Country\\" episode, providing the voice of Benjamin Franklin. He also served as a consultant on the episodes \\"I'm a Little Bit Country\\" and \\"Cancelled\\". Lear has attended a South Park writers' retreat, and served as the officiant at co-creator Trey Parker's wedding. = 2010s = Lear is spotlighted in the 2016 documentary Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You. In 2017, Lear served as executive producer for One Day at a Time, the reboot of his 1975-1984 show of the same name that premiered on Netflix starring Justina Machado and Rita Moreno as a Cuban-American family. He has hosted a podcast, All of the Above with Norman Lear, since May 1, 2017. On July 29, 2019, it was announced that Lear had teamed with Lin-Manuel Miranda to make an American Masters documentary about Moreno's life, tentatively titled \\"Rita Moreno: The Girl Who Decided to Go For It.\\"Rita Moreno documentary in the works from Lin-Manuel Miranda and Norman Lear - CNN  Awards  In 1967, Lear was nominated for an Academy Award for writing Divorce American Style. Lear was among the first seven television pioneers inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1984. He received five Emmy Awards (two in 1971, one each in 1972 and 1973, and one in 2019)Norman Lear Breaks an Emmy Record, Becomes the Oldest Winner Ever and two Peabody Awards (a personal award in 1977 and an individual award in 2016). He received the Humanist Arts Award from the American Humanist Association in 1977. His star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located at 6615 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded the National Medal of Arts to Lear, noting, \\"Norman Lear has held up a mirror to American society and changed the way we look at it.\\" Also in 1999, he and Bud Yorkin received the Women in Film Lucy Award in recognition of excellence and innovation in creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television. On May 12, 2017, Lear was awarded the fourth annual Woody Guthrie Prize presented by the Woody Guthrie Center based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The event took place in the Clive Davis Theater at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. The Woody Guthrie Prize is given annually to an artist who exemplifies the spirit and life work of Guthrie by speaking for the less fortunate through music, literature, film, dance or other art forms and serving as a positive force for social change in America. Previous honorees include Pete Seeger, Mavis Staples and Kris Kristofferson. On August 3, 2017, it was announced that the Kennedy Center had made Lear, along with Carmen de Lavallade, Lionel Richie, LL Cool J, and Gloria Estefan, one of the recipients of the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors. US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were scheduled to be seated with the honorees during the Kennedy Center ceremony, which took place on December 3, 2017, and they were planning to host a reception with them at the White House earlier in the evening. Variety magazine's senior editor Ted Johnson reacted with statements such as \\"That in and of itself will be an interesting moment, as Lear and Estefan have been particularly outspoken against Trump and his policies.\\"Kennedy Center Honorees: Trump Protest Looms From Norman Lear ‚Äì Variety It was afterwards announced that Lear would boycott the White House reception.https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/us/politics/kennedy-center- arts-honors-trump.html In the end, the President and Mrs. Trump did not attend. Lear was honored as The New Jewish Home's Eight over Eighty Gala 2017 honoree. In 2019, Lear was awarded the Britannia Award for Excellence in Television.  Political and cultural activities  In addition to his success as a TV producer and businessman, Lear is an outspoken supporter of First Amendment and liberal causes. The only time that he did not support the Democratic candidate for President was in 1980. He supported John Anderson because he considered the Carter administration to be \\"a complete disaster.\\" Lear was one of the wealthy Jewish Angelenos known as the Malibu Mafia. In the 1970s and 1980s, the group discussed progressive and liberal political issues, and worked together to fund them. They helped to fund the legal defense of Daniel Ellsberg who had released the Pentagon Papers, and they backed the struggling progressive magazine The Nation to keep it afloat. In 1975, they formed the Energy Action Committee to oppose Big Oil's powerful lobby in Washington. In 1981, Lear founded People for the American Way (PFAW), a progressive advocacy organization formed to oppose the Christian right. PFAW ran several advertising campaigns opposing the interjection of religion in politics. PFAW succeeded in stopping Reagan's 1987 nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Lear has long been a vocal critic of the ideas held by the Conservatives and Christians and has advocated for the advancement of secularism.Interview: Anti-Christian-Right Crusader Norman Lear on Becoming a 'Born-Again American' US News, Dan Gilgoff, February 10, 2009, Accessed February 26, 2013 Prominent right-wing Christians such as Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Swaggart accused Lear of being an atheist and holding an anti-Christian bias.A Profile of Norman Lear: Another Pilgrim's Progress Norman Lear.com, Martin E Marty, Accessed February 26, 2013 In the January 21, 1987, issue of The Christian Century, Lear associate Martin E. Marty, a Lutheran professor who taught church history at the University of Chicago Divinity School between 1963 and 1998, rejected the allegations and stated that the television producer had praised the moral values of various religions and had personally praised his interpretation of Christianity. Marty also noted that while Lear and his family were never followers of the Orthodox Judaism that was practiced in his childhood community and questioned the beliefs held by the local religious leaders, the television producer was still a follower of Judaism. In a 2009 interview with US News journalist Dan Gilgoff, Lear rejected claims by the Conservatives and Christians that he either was an atheist or prejudiced against Christianity and maintained that while he did not believe religion should hold influence in politics or any other form of policymaking, he still held religious beliefs and had also integrated some evangelical Christian language into his Born Again American campaign as well. In a 2014 interview with The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles journalist Rob Eshman, Lear described himself as a \\"total Jew\\" but never a practicing one. In 1989, Lear founded the Business Enterprise Trust, an educational program that used annual awards, business school case studies, and videos to spotlight exemplary social innovations in American business until it ended in 1998. He announced in 1992 that he would reduce his political activism. In 2000, he provided an endowment for a multidisciplinary research and public policy center that explored the convergence of entertainment, commerce, and society at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. It was later named the Norman Lear Center in recognition. Lear serves on the National Advisory Board of the Young Storytellers Foundation. He has written articles for The Huffington Post. Lear is a trustee emeritus at The Paley Center for Media. = Declaration of Independence = In 2001, Lear and his wife, Lyn, purchased a Dunlap broadside‚Äîone of the first published copies of the United States Declaration of Independence‚Äîfor $8.1 million. Not a document collector, Lear said in a press release and on the Today show that his intent was to tour the document around the United States so that the country could experience its \\"birth certificate\\" firsthand.Today Show interview with Katie Couric, February 8, 2002 Through the end of 2004, the document traveled throughout the United States in the Declaration of Independence Roadtrip, which Lear organized, visiting several presidential libraries, dozens of museums, as well as the 2002 Olympics, Super Bowl XXXVI, and the Live 8 concert in Philadelphia. Lear and Rob Reiner produced a filmed, dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence‚Äîthe last project filmed by famed cinematographer Conrad Hall‚Äîon July 4, 2001, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The film, introduced by Morgan Freeman, features Kathy Bates, Benicio del Toro, Michael Douglas, Mel Gibson, Whoopi Goldberg, Graham Greene, Ming-Na, Edward Norton, Winona Ryder, Kevin Spacey, and Ren√©e Zellweger as readers. The film was directed by Arvin Brown and scored by John Williams. = Declare Yourself = In 2004, Lear established Declare Yourself, a national nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign created to empower and encourage eligible 18- to 29-year-olds in America to register and vote. Since then, it has registered almost 4 million young people. = 2015 Iran nuclear deal = Lear was one of 98 \\"prominent members of Los Angeles' Jewish community\\" that signed an open letter supporting the proposed nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers led by the United States.

The plant is similar in appearance to other members of the carrot family, with finely divided, feathery leaves with thread-like divisions, growing on stems. The main flower stem is tall, with small white or pink flowers in umbels. Caraway fruits, commonly (erroneously) called seeds, are crescent-shaped achenes, around long, with five pale ridges.  Names  The etymology of caraway is complex and poorly understood. Caraway has been called by many names in different regions, with names deriving from the Latin cuminum (cumin), the Greek karon (again, cumin), which was adapted into Latin as carum (now meaning caraway), and the Sanskrit karavi, sometimes translated as \\"caraway\\", but other times understood to mean \\"fennel\\".Katzer's Spice Pages: Caraway Caraway (Carum carvi L.) English use of the term caraway dates back to at least 1440,Walter William Skeat, Principles of English etymology, Volume 2, page 319. 1891 Words of Arabic Origin and is considered by Walter William Skeat to be of Arabic origin, though Gernot Katzer believes the Arabic al-karawya ŸÉÿ±ÿßŸàŸäÿ© (cf. Spanish alcaravea) to be derived from the Latin carum.  History  Caraway was mentioned by the Greek Dioscorides as a herb and tonic. It was later mentioned in the Roman Apicius as an ingredient in recipes. Later, caraway was known in the Arab world as karauya, and cultivated in Morocco.  Uses  Caraway fruits The fruits, usually used whole, have a pungent, anise- like flavor and aroma that comes from essential oils, mostly carvone, limonene, and anethole. Caraway is used as a spice in breads, especially rye bread.Rodale's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Herbs Caraway is also used in desserts, liquors, casseroles, and other foods. Its leaves can be added to salads, stews, and soups, and are sometimes consumed as herbs, either raw, dried, or cooked, similar to parsley. The root is consumed as a winter root vegetable in some places, similar to parsnips. Caraway fruits are found in diverse European cuisines and dishes, for example sauerkraut, and caraway seed cake. In Austrian cuisine it is used to season beef and, in German cuisine, pork. In Hungarian cuisine it is added to goulash, and in Norwegian cuisine and Swedish cuisine it is used for making caraway black bread. In Hungary and Serbia, caraway is commonly sprinkled over home-made salty scones (k√∂m√©nyes pog√°csa / pogaƒçice s kimom). It is also used to add flavor to cheeses such as bondost, pultost, havarti, and Tilsit. Caraway oil is used to for the production of K√ºmmel liquor in Germany and Russia, Scandinavian akvavit, Icelandic brenniv√≠n. In Middle Eastern cuisine, caraway pudding, called meghli, is a popular dessert during Ramadan. It is typically made and served in the Levant area in winter and on the occasion of having a new baby. Caraway is also added to flavor harissa, a North African chili pepper paste. In Aleppian Syrian cuisine it is used to make the sweet scones named keleacha. Caraway fruit oil is also used as a fragrance component in soaps, lotions, and perfumes. Caraway is also used as a breath freshener, and it has a long tradition of use in folk medicine. In the United States, the most common use of caraway is whole as an addition to rye bread ‚Äì often called seeded rye or Jewish rye bread. Caraway fruits are frequently used in Irish soda bread, along with raisins and currants.  Cultivation  Caraway is distributed throughout practically all of Europe except the Mediterranean region; it is widely established as a cultivated plant. All other European species of Carum generally have smaller fruits; some grow on rocks in the mountains, chiefly in the Balkans, Italian Alps and Apennines. However the only one that is cultivated is Carum carvi, its fruits being used in many ways in cooking and its essential oils in the preparation of certain medicines and liqueurs. The plant prefers warm, sunny locations and well-drained soil rich in organic matter. In warmer regions, it is planted in the winter as an annual. In temperate climates, it is planted as a summer annual or biennial. However, a polyploid variant (with four haploid sets=4n) of this plant was found to be perennial. Finland supplies about 28% (2011) of the world's caraway production from some 1500 farms, the high output occurring possibly from its favorable climate and latitudes, which ensure long summer hours of sunlight.

Historically the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order. Today shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup. In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6. More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position, as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly. Like a second baseman, a shortstop must be agile, for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play. Also, like a third baseman, the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield, where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter- runner before they reach the safety of first base. History Doc Adams of the Knickerbockers created the concept of the shortstop position, according to baseball historian John Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield because of the balls' light weight. Adams's shortstop position, which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved to the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Adams had a long playing career with the Knickerbockers: he remained a player with the team until 1860. Positioning Unlike the pitcher and catcher, who must start every play in a designated area (the pitcher must be on the pitcher's mound, with one foot in contact with the pitcher's rubber, and the catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher's box) the shortstop and the other fielders can vary their positioning in response to what they anticipate will be the actions of the batter and runner(s) once the play begins.Baseball Explained, by Phillip Mahony. McFarland Books, 2014. See www.baseballexplained.com The shortstop ordinarily is positioned near second base on the third-base side. Because right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball more toward third base, a shortstop will generally move closer to third base if the batter is batting right-handed, and more toward first base if the batter is batting left-handed. A shortstop typically has a strong throwing arm, because he has a relatively long throw to first base, and often has less time in which to make a throw, given that the ground balls he fields have often traveled relatively far. A shortstop must also be extremely agile, because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to other infield positions. Shortstops are required to cover second base in double play situations when the ball is hit to the second baseman or first baseman. They also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base, but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base, resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base. Shortstops also must cover third at various times, including the rotation play; the latter occurs when there are runners on first and second and a sacrifice bunt is attempted toward third base, requiring the third baseman to move in away from third base in order to field it. Shortstops generally are given precedence on catching pop-ups in the infield as well, so they end up calling off other players many times, although on deep pop-ups they generally fall back when called off by an outfielder. They often become the cutoff man on balls to any part of the outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and center field that are destined for second base. Depending on the system the shortstop may cut balls from left field heading home; however, this is usually the job of the third baseman. The emphasis on defense makes the position unusually difficult to fill. Historically, a strong shortstop did not have to be a good hitter. Some of the weakest hitters in Major League Baseball have played the position, including Mario Mendoza, for whom George Brett popularized the eponymous Mendoza Line to describe a batting average below .200. Since the 1960s, however, such mediocre hitting has become rarer as teams increasingly demand players with ability to both field and hit. In practice, a marginal fielder as a shortstop who hits well can be moved to almost any other position, especially second base or third base, whether early in their careers (examples: George Brett and Mike Schmidt were both tried early in their careers as shortstops) or later due to diminished fielding range, slower reflexes, weaker throwing arms, increased risk of injury, or co-existence with another dominant shortstop, as with Ernie Banks, Cal Ripken Jr., Alex Rodr√≠guez, Michael Young, or Miguel Tejada.

The English novel is an important part of English literature. This article mainly concerns novels, written in English, by novelists who were born or have spent a significant part of their lives in England, or Scotland, or Wales, or Northern Ireland (or Ireland before 1922). However, given the nature of the subject, this guideline has been applied with common sense, and reference is made to novels in other languages or novelists who are not primarily British where appropriate. Early novels in English The English novel has generally been seen as beginning with Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Moll Flanders (1722),\\"Defoe\\", The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxforsd University Press,1996), p. 265. though John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678) and Aphra Behn's Oroonoko (1688) are also contenders, while earlier works such as Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur, and even the \\"Prologue\\" to Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales have been suggested.J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1984), pp. 433, 434. Another important early novel is Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, which is both a satire of human nature, as well as a parody of travellers' tales like Robinson Crusoe.http://www.abebooks.co.uk/book-search/title/gullivers- travels/author/dean-swift/sortby/3/ The rise of the novel as an important literary genre is generally associated with the growth of the middle class in England. Other major 18th-century English novelists are Samuel Richardson (1689‚Äì1761), author of the epistolary novels Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740) and Clarissa (1747‚Äì48); Henry Fielding (1707‚Äì1754), who wrote Joseph Andrews (1742) and The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749); Laurence Sterne (1713‚Äì1768), who published Tristram Shandy in parts between 1759 and 1767;The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 947. Oliver Goldsmith (1728‚Äì1774), author of The Vicar of Wakefield (1766); Tobias Smollett (1721‚Äì1771), a Scottish novelist best known for his comic picaresque novels, such as The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751) and The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (1771), who influenced Charles Dickens; and Fanny Burney (1752‚Äì1840), whose novels \\"were enjoyed and admired by Jane Austen,\\" wrote Evelina (1778), Cecilia (1782) and Camilla (1796).The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press,1996), p. 151. A noteworthy aspect of both the 18th- and 19th- century novel is the way the novelist directly addressed the reader. For example, the author might interrupt his or her narrative to pass judgment on a character, or pity or praise another, and inform or remind the reader of some other relevant issue. Romantic period Sir Walter Scott The phrase 'Romantic novel' has several possible meanings. Here it refers to novels written during the Romantic era in literary history, which runs from the late 18th century until the beginning of the Victorian era in 1837. But to complicate matters there are novels written in the romance tradition by novelists like Walter Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, George Meredith.J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. (Harmondsworth:Penguin Books, 1984), p. 582. In addition the phrase today is mostly used to refer to the popular pulp-fiction genre that focusses on romantic love. The Romantic period is especially associated with the poets William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, George Byron, Percy Shelley and John Keats, though two major novelists, Jane Austen and Walter Scott, also published in the early 19th century. Horace Walpole's 1764 novel, The Castle of Otranto, invented the Gothic fiction genre. The word gothic was originally used in the sense of medieval.J. A. Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms, p. 289. This genre combines \\"the macabre, fantastic, and supernatural\\" and usually involves haunted castles, graveyards and various picturesque elements.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press,1996), p. 411. Later novelist Ann Radcliffe introduced the brooding figure of the Gothic villain which developed into the Byronic hero. Her most popular and influential work, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), is frequently described as the archetypal Gothic novel. Vathek (1786), by William Beckford, and The Monk (1796), by Matthew Lewis, were further notable early works in both the Gothic and horror genres. Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein (1818), as another important Gothic novel as well as being an early example of science fiction.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 886. The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori's The Vampyre (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem The Giaour. An important later work is Varney the Vampire (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the \\"sympathetic vampire\\", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.Skal, David J. (1996). V is for Vampire, p. 99. New York: Plume. . Mary Shelley Among more minor novelists in this period Maria Edgeworth (1768‚Äì1849) and Thomas Love Peacock (1785‚Äì1866) are worthy of comment. Edgeworth's novel Castle Rackrent (1800) is \\"the first fully developed regional novel in English\\" as well as \\"the first true historical novel in English\\" and an important influence on Walter Scott.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 310. Peacock was primarily a satirist in novels such as Nightmare Abbey (1818) and The Misfortunes of Elphin (1829). Jane Austen's (1775‚Äì1817) works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism.Litz, pp. 3‚Äì14; Grundy, \\"Jane Austen and Literary Traditions\\", The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen, pp. 192‚Äì193; Waldron, \\"Critical Responses, Early\\", Jane Austen in Context, pp. 83, 89‚Äì90; Duffy, \\"Criticism, 1814‚Äì1870\\", The Jane Austen Companion, pp. 93‚Äì94. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security.A. Walton Litz, Jane Austen: A Study of Her Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1965. p. 142; Oliver MacDonagh, Jane Austen: Real and Imagined Worlds. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. pp. 66‚Äì75; Collins, 160‚Äì161. Austen brings to light the hardships women faced, who usually did not inherit money, could not work and where their only chance in life depended on the man they married. She reveals not only the difficulties women faced in her day, but also what was expected of men and of the careers they had to follow. This she does with wit and humour and with endings where all characters, good or bad, receive exactly what they deserve. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become accepted as a major writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture. Austen's works include Pride and Prejudice (1813) Sense and Sensibility (1811), Mansfield Park, Persuasion and Emma. The other major novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was Sir Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832), who was not only a highly successful British novelist but \\"the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century ... [and] a European figure\\".J. A. Cuddon, p. 435. Scott established the genre of the historical novel with his series of Waverley Novels, including Waverley (1814), The Antiquary (1816), and The Heart of Midlothian (1818).The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 890. However, Austen is today widely read and the source for films and television series, while Scott is less often read. Victorian novel It was in the Victorian era (1837‚Äì1901) that the novel became the leading literary genre in English. A number of women novelists were successful in the 19th century, although they often had to use a masculine pseudonym. At the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes. However, monthly serialization was revived with the publication of Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers in twenty parts between April 1836 and November 1837. Demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element, whether it was a plot twist or a new character, so as to maintain the readers' interest. Both Dickens and Thackeray frequently published this way.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), pp. 97‚Äì8. The 1830s and 1840s saw the rise of social novel, also known as social problem novel, that \\"arose out of the social and political upheavals which followed the Reform Act of 1832\\".Bloomsbury Guide, p. 101. This was in many ways a reaction to rapid industrialization, and the social, political and economic issues associated with it, and was a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor, who were not profiting from England's economic prosperity.\\"James, Louis(2006)\\" Stories of the working class poor were directed toward middle class to help create sympathy and promote change. An early example is Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist (1837‚Äì38). Charles Dickens Charles Dickens emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s with the two novels already mentioned. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and struggles of the poor, but in a good-humoured fashion, accessible to readers of all classes. One of his most popular works to this day is A Christmas Carol (1843). In more recent years Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as Dombey and Son (1846‚Äì48), Great Expectations (1860‚Äì61), Bleak House (1852‚Äì53) and Little Dorrit (1855‚Äì57) and Our Mutual Friend (1864‚Äì65). An early rival to Dickens was William Makepeace Thackeray, who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for Vanity Fair (1847). In that novel he satirizes whole swaths of humanity while retaining a light touch. It features his most memorable character, the engagingly roguish Becky Sharp. The Bront√´ sisters were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published but were subsequently accepted as classics. They had written compulsively from early childhood and were first published, at their own expense in 1846 as poets under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The sisters returned to prose, producing a novel each the following year: Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights and Anne's Agnes Grey. Later, Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848) and Charlotte's Villette (1853) were published. Elizabeth Gaskell was also a successful writer and first novel, Mary Barton, was published anonymously in 1848. Gaskell's North and South contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south. Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, Gaskell usually frames her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes: her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She always emphasised the role of women, with complex narratives and dynamic female characters.Abrams, M.H., et al. (Eds.) \\"Elizabeth Gaskell, 1810‚Äì1865\\". The Norton Anthology of English Literature, The Major Authors: The Romantic Period through the Twentieth Century, 7th ed., Vol. B. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company, 2001. . DDC 820.8‚Äîdc21. LC PR1109.N6. Anthony Trollope (1815‚Äì82) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Some of his best-loved works are set in the imaginary county of Barsetshire, including The Warden (1855) and Barchester Towers (1857). He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters, including The Way with Live Now (1875). Trollope's novels portrayed the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England. George Eliot's (Mary Ann Evans (1819‚Äì80) first novel Adam Bede was published in 1859. Her works, especially Middlemarch 1871‚Äì72), are important examples of literary realism, and are admired for their combination of high Victorian literary detail combined with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict. H. G. Wells studying in London, taken c. 1890 An interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy (1840‚Äì1928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of George Eliot, he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by Romanticism, especially by William Wordsworth.Dennis Taylor, \\"Hardy and Wordsworth\\". Victorian Poetry, vol.24, no.4, Winter, 1986. Charles Darwin is another important influence on Thomas Hardy.Gillian Beer, Darwin's Plots. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009. Like Charles Dickens he was also highly critical of much in Victorian society, though Hardy focussed more on a declining rural society. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life, and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898, so that initially he gained fame as the author of such novels as, Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895). He ceased writing novels following adverse criticism of this last novel. In novels such as The Mayor of Casterbridge and Tess of the d'Urbervilles Hardy attempts to create modern works in the genre of tragedy, that are modelled on the Greek drama, especially Aeschylus and Sophocles, though in prose, not poetry, a novel not drama, and with characters of low social standing, not nobility. \\"Aristotelian Tragedy and the Novels of Thomas Hardy\\" Another significant late 19th-century novelist is George Gissing (1857‚Äì1903) who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. His best known novel is New Grub Street (1891). Important developments occurred in genre fiction in this era. Although pre-dated by John Ruskin's The King of the Golden River in 1841, the history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of The Princess and the Goblin and Phantastes (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Wilkie Collins' epistolary novel The Moonstone (1868), is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, while The Woman in White is regarded as one of the finest sensation novels. H. G. Wells's (1866‚Äì1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like The Time Machine (1895), and The War of the Worlds (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828‚Äì1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like Kipps (1905) and The History of Mr Polly (1910). 20th century The major novelists writing in Britain at the start of the 20th century were an Irishman James Joyce (1882‚Äì1941) and two immigrants, American Henry James (1843‚Äì1916) and Pole Joseph Conrad (1857‚Äì1924). The modernist tradition in the novel, with its emphasis \\"towards the ever more minute and analytic exposition of mental life\\", begins with James and Conrad, in novels such as The Ambassadors (1903), The Golden Bowl (1907) and Lord Jim (1900).John Carruthers, Scheherazade: or the Future of the English Novel (1928), quoted in Randall Stevenson,Modernist Fiction: An Introduction. (Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992) pp. 18, 19, 22. Other important early modernists were Dorothy Richardson (1873‚Äì1957), whose novel Pointed Roof (1915), is one of the earliest example of the stream of consciousness technique and D. H. Lawrence (1885‚Äì1930), who wrote with understanding about the social life of the lower and middle classes, and the personal life of those who could not adapt to the social norms of his time. Sons and Lovers (1913), is widely regarded as his earliest masterpiece. There followed The Rainbow (1915), though it was immediately seized by the police, and its sequel Women in Love published in 1920.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 562. Lawrence attempted to explore human emotions more deeply than his contemporaries and challenged the boundaries of the acceptable treatment of sexual issues, most notably in Lady Chatterley's Lover, which was privately published in Florence in 1928. However, the unexpurgated version of this novel was not published until 1959.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 562. Then in 1922 Irishman James Joyce's important modernist novel Ulysses appeared.

(New York: Prentice Hall, 19900, p. 644. Another significant modernist in the 1920 was Virginia Woolf (1882‚Äì1941), who was an influential feminist and a major stylistic innovator associated with the stream-of-consciousness technique. Her novels include Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927), and The Waves (1931). Her essay collection A Room of One's Own (1929) contains her famous dictum; \\"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\\".The Cambridge companion to Virginia Woolf. By Sue Roe, Susan Sellers. p. 219. Cambridge University Press, 2000. Virginia Woolf But while modernism was to become an important literary movement in the early decades of the new century, there were also many fine novelists who were not modernists. This include E.M. Forster ((1879‚Äì1970), John Galsworthy ((1867‚Äì1933) (Nobel Prize in Literature, 1932), whose novels include The Forsyte Saga, Arnold Bennett (1867‚Äì1931) author of The Old Wives' Tale, and H. G. Wells (1866‚Äì1946). Though Forster's work is \\"frequently regarded as containing both modernist and Victorian elements\\".The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, ed. Marion Wynne Davies (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p. 118. E. M. Forster's A Passage to India (1924), reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier works such as A Room with a View (1908) and Howards End (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of Edwardian society in England. The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably Rudyard Kipling ((1865‚Äì1936), a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems and to date the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (1907). A significant English writer in the 1930s and 1940s was George Orwell (1903‚Äì50), who is especially remembered for his satires of totalitarianism, Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and Animal Farm (1945). Evelyn Waugh (1903‚Äì66) satirised the \\"bright young things\\" of the 1920s and 1930s, notably in A Handful of Dust (1934), and Decline and Fall (1928), while Brideshead Revisited (1945) has a theological basis, setting out to examine the effect of divine grace on its main characters.Memo dated 18 February 1947 from Evelyn Waugh to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, reproduced in Aldous Huxley (1894‚Äì1963) published his famous dystopia Brave New World in 1932, the same year as John Cowper Powys's (1872‚Äì1963) A Glastonbury Romance. Samuel Beckett (1906‚Äì89) published his first major work, the novel Murphy in 1938. This same year Graham Greene's (1904‚Äì91) first major novel Brighton Rock was published. Then in 1939 James Joyce published Finnegans Wake. In this work Joyce creates a special language to express the consciousness of a character who is dreaming.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, p. 644. D. H. Lawrence, 1906 Graham Greene was an important novelist whose works span the 1930s to the 1980s. Greene was a convert to Catholicism and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Notable for an ability to combine serious literary acclaim with broad popularity, his novels include, The Heart of the Matter (1948), A Burnt-Out Case (1961), and The Human Factor (1978). Evelyn Waugh's (1903‚Äì66) career also continued after World War II, and in \\"1961 he completed his most considerable work, a trilogy about the war entitled Sword of Honour.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p. 1008. In 1947 Malcolm Lowry published Under the Volcano, while George Orwell's satire of totalitarianism, 1984, was published in 1949. One of the most influential novels of the immediate post-war period was William Cooper's (1910‚Äì2002) naturalistic Scenes from Provincial Life (1950), which was a conscious rejection of the modernist tradition.Bradbury, Malcolm. \\"Introduction to Scenes from Provincial Life. (Macmillan, London, 1969). Other novelists writing in the 1950s and later were: Anthony Powell (1905‚Äì2000) whose twelve-volume cycle of novels A Dance to the Music of Time (1951‚Äì75), is a comic examination of movements and manners, power and passivity in English political, cultural and military life in the mid-20th century; comic novelist Kingsley Amis is best known for his academic satire Lucky Jim (1954); Nobel Prize laureate William Golding's allegorical novel Lord of the Flies (1954), explores how culture created by man fails, using as an example a group of British schoolboys marooned on a deserted island; philosopher Iris Murdoch was a prolific writer of novels that deal with such things as sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious. Her works including Under the Net (1954), The Black Prince (1973) and The Green Knight (1993). Scottish writer Muriel Spark's also began publishing in the 1950s. She pushed the boundaries of realism in her novels. Her first, The Comforters (1957), concerns a woman who becomes aware that she is a character in a novel; The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961), at times takes the reader briefly into the distant future to see the various fates that befall its characters. Anthony Burgess is especially remembered for his dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange (1962), set in the not-too-distant future, which was made into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. In the entirely different genre of Gothic fantasy Mervyn Peake (1911‚Äì68) published his highly successful Gormenghast trilogy between 1946 and 1959. Immigrant authors played a major role in post-war literature. Doris Lessing (1919) from Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), published her first novel The Grass is Singing in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the Nobel prize for literature in 2007. Salman Rushdie (born 1947) is another among a number of post Second World War writers from the former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with Midnight's Children 1981, which was awarded both the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and Booker prize, and named Booker of Bookers in 1993. His most controversial novel The Satanic Verses (1989), was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. V. S. Naipaul (1932-2018), born in Trinidad, was another immigrant, who wrote among other things A House for Mr Biswas (1961) and A Bend in the River (1979). Naipaul won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Also from the West Indies George Lamming (born 1927) is best remembered for In the Castle of the Skin (1953). Another important immigrant writer Kazuo Ishiguro (born 1954) was born in Japan, but his parents immigrated to Britain when he was six.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 506. His works include, The Remains of the Day 1989, Never Let Me Go 2005. Anthony Burgess Scotland has in the late 20th-century produced several important novelists, including James Kelman (born 1946), who like Samuel Beckett can create humour out of the most grim situations. How Late it Was, How Late (1994), won the Booker Prize that year; A. L. Kennedy (born 1965) whose 2007 novel Day was named Book of the Year in the Costa Book Awards. In 2007 she won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature; Alasdair Gray (1934‚Äì2019) whose Lanark: A Life in Four Books (1981) is a dystopian fantasy set in his home town Glasgow. Another contemporary Scot is Irvine Welsh, whose novel Trainspotting (1993), gives a brutal depiction of the lives of working class Edinburgh drug users.Irvine Welsh plans Trainspotting prequel The Sunday Times Retrieved 15 March 2011. Angela Carter (1940‚Äì1992) was a novelist and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism, and picaresque works. Writing from the 1960s until the 1980s, her novels include, The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman (1972) and Nights at the Circus (1984). Margaret Drabble (born 1939) is a novelist, biographer and critic, who has published from the 1960s until this century. Her older sister, A. S. Byatt (born 1936) is best known for Possession published in 1990. Martin Amis (born 1949) is one of the most prominent of contemporary British novelists. His best-known novels are Money (1984) and London Fields (1989). Pat Barker (born 1943) has won many awards for her fiction. Novelist and screenwriter Ian McEwan (born 1948) is another of contemporary Britain's most highly regarded writers. His works include The Cement Garden (1978) and Enduring Love (1997), which was made into a film. In 1998 McEwan won the Man Booker Prize with Amsterdam, while Atonement (2001) was made into an Oscar-winning film. McEwan was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 2011. Zadie Smith's (born 1975) Whitbread Book Award winning novel White Teeth (2000), mixes pathos and humour, focusing on the later lives of two war time friends in London. Julian Barnes (born 1946) is another successful living novelist, who won the 2011 Man Booker Prize for his book The Sense of an Ending, while three of his earlier books had been shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Among popular novelists Daphne Du Maurier wrote Rebecca, a mystery novel, in 1938 and W. Somerset Maugham (1874‚Äì1965) Of Human Bondage (1915), a strongly autobiographical novel, is generally agreed to be his masterpiece. In genre fiction Agatha Christie was an important writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie's novels include Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Death on the Nile (1937), and And Then There Were None (1939). Another popular writer during the Golden Age of detective fiction was Dorothy L. Sayers, while Georgette Heyer created the historical romance genre.

Appearing as a serial in the manga magazine Nakayoshi from the November 1993 issue to the February 1995 issue, the chapters of Magic Knight Rayearth were collected into three bound volumes by Kodansha, and were published from July 1994 to March 1995. A sequel was serialized in the same manga magazine from the March 1995 issue to the April 1996 issue, and was published by Kodansha in three bound volumes from to July 1995 to April 1996. The series follows three eighth-grade girls who find themselves transported from modern-day Japan into a magical world, where they are tasked with rescuing a princess. Rayearth combines elements from the magical girl and mecha anime genres with parallel world fantasy. The manga was adapted into two anime series in 1994 and an original video animation (OVA) in 1997.  Plot  Magic Knight Rayearth begins with the protagonists' field trip to the Tokyo Tower (pictured). Magic Knight Rayearth focuses on three eighth-grade girls: the tomboyish, headstrong but short ; the quick-tempered and no-nonsense only child ; and the intelligent and ladylike . While on a field trip to the Tokyo Tower with their respective schools, the girls find themselves drawn into another world, Cephiro. There they learn that Cephiro is influenced by one's will and that the Pillar maintains Cephiro through prayer. The girls are then tasked with rescuing the current Pillar, Princess Emeraude, from her abductor, the high priest and antagonist Zagato, after which they will be returned to Tokyo. Guided by the creature Mokona on their quest, the girls discover their respective element-based magic and awaken the three , creatures who can take the form of giant robots that the girls must pilot. As the girls progress on their journey, they overcome their differences, learning how to work together and accept each other as friends. After the girls find Zagato, they fight and are able to destroy him. After this, they finally reach where Emeraude is imprisoned, but the three learn that she had fallen in love with Zagato, which had hindered her ability to pray solely for Cephiro's well- being. Feeling responsible for her actions, she had imprisoned herself, and eventually summoned the Magic Knights to kill her, as no one from Cephiro could harm the Pillar. Her dark side then takes over, seeking to destroy the Magic Knights for killing her love. After a short defensive fight against Princess Emeraude, the Magic Knights have no choice but to kill her. They then find themselves transported back to Tokyo. The second part of the series deals with the complications caused by Princess Emeraude's death. Set a year later, it opens with the three protagonists struggling with their guilt and despair over their role in her death. Meeting again at Tokyo Tower, they find themselves transported mysteriously to Cephiro again, and discover that only a single piece of Cephiro remains, which holds a castle where the survivors gather to take refuge. With the Pillar gone, Cephiro is, for the most part, defenseless, and the girls are saddened to learn that a new Pillar must be chosen by the Pillar system before the whole planet is destroyed. Not only that, three warring planets have begun their attempts to conquer the Pillar- less Cephiro: Autozam, a technologically advanced world which intends to use the Pillar system to remove the pollution in its air; Fahren, whose childish ruler Lady Aska plans to use it to turn Cephiro into a world of her whims; and Chizeta, an overpopulated world whose sibling rulers Tatra and Tarta plan to use it to make Cephiro into a colony. As the Magic Knights help defend the castle, they each agree that the fate of the planet should not be the responsibility of only one person which, like Princess Emeraude, effectively prevents that person from ever being able to live and love freely. What's more, there is a mostly unspoken risk that when a new Pillar is chosen, something may eventually hinder them from praying solely for Cephiro's well- being, cause them to summon new Magic Knights to kill them, and bring Cephiro to near-destruction again until a new Pillar is chosen, causing the cycle of events to continue endlessly. As such, Lantis, a powerful magic swordsman and Zagato's younger brother, wishes to end the Pillar system for those reasons. Eventually, Mokona narrows the candidates down to two: Hikaru and the sickly Eagle Vision of Autozam, who is friends with Lantis and, as such, wishes to end the Pillar system for him with his eternal sleep. As the two undergo the test to become the new Pillar in a recreation of Tokyo, Mokona reveals itself to be the creator of Cephiro and its laws, both of which it had created after sadly witnessing the violence and destructive nature of the people on its earlier creation, Earth. It was responsible for bringing the three girls back to Cephiro. In the end, Hikaru becomes the new Pillar of Cephiro, and brings Eagle Vision back to Cephiro from the Tokyo recreation with the help of Fuu and Umi, against Mokona's insistence that only one may return. Hikaru then rejects the Pillar system, decreeing once and for all the fate of the planet should not be the responsibility of one person. Mokona accepts their decision and leaves with the three Mashin. The manga concludes with the three girls' returning to a new Cephiro to visit their loved ones, as they work with the rulers of the other planets to solve their planets' problems, and contemplate Mokona's wish to allow the three protagonists to bring change to Cephiro. = Differences in the anime adaptation = The first season remains mostly faithful to the first arc of the manga aside from the inclusion of the original character Inouva and a multitude of subplots, but the second season shows a rapid departure. Most notable differences are the creation of two anime-only antagonists, Nova and Lady Debonair, who were born from the intense despair of Hikaru and the people of Cephiro respectively after the death of Princess Emeraude. It is also revealed by the Rune Gods that the girls were summoned back to Cephiro by their own will, most notably Hikaru's as her strength of heart also allowed her to become the new Pillar, a position she rejects in a similar fashion to the manga. Development During the celebration of the publication of the Soryuden novels, which Clamp had illustrated, the group was asked by Hideki Yamaguchi, editor for the Japanese sh≈çjo (targeted towards girls) manga magazine Nakayoshi, to do a series for the magazine. The editor-in-chief wanted a story that could appeal to elementary readers and older, while Clamp wished to bring in younger fans. Without direction from the editors, the group decided on a series combining robots, as they were fond of robot anime; role-playing games (RPGs), which saw popularity in Japan at the time; and fantasy, to counterbalance the robots, which they thought alone would be off-putting to their target audience. According to Ohkawa, the magazine's success with the magical girl manga Sailor Moon (1992‚Äì97) made it possible for the group to pitch a serial with robots to its editors. A friend of Clamp, illustrator Takeshi Okazaki, created the \\"Rayearth\\" part of the title, while Ohkawa thought of the rest. At that point, Clamp had completed a \\"basic\\" idea of the plot. For the names of the characters, they drew on car names, feeling that they would be interesting and memorable for children, who might otherwise have difficulty learning the names of characters in katakana. The inclusion of giant robots gave the artists some difficulty, as the massive scale of the robots made it impossible to depict the characters and robots in the same frame. The artists also omitted the cockpit of the robots, to show their faces instead. Greatly anticipating the ending to the first part of the series, Clamp found the protagonists' initial adventures in Cephiro \\"really easy\\" to create. Ohkawa noted that, had their target audience been older or male, they would have considered stopping the series with the conclusion of part one. The second part, however, proved difficult for the group to create, as they felt as if they had \\"written [them]selves into a corner\\". Magic Knight Rayearth explores \\"fate, grim destiny, and sacrifice,\\" as do many of Clamp's works. According to Ohkawa, who believes in choosing one's fate, humanity's fate is caused by one's actions; Cephiro is merely an exaggeration of Earth. Media =Manga= Written and illustrated by Clamp, Magic Knight Rayearth appeared as a serial in the Japanese magazine Nakayoshi from November 1993 to February 1995. Kodansha collected the chapters in three tank≈çbon volumes. The first was published on July 22, 1994; the last was released on March 6, 1995. The sequel also appeared in Nakayoshi from March 1995 to April 1996. In 1997, Tokyopop licensed Magic Knight Rayearth for an English-language translation in North America, and serialized it in its manga magazine MixxZine. The English version of the manga was at first issued in a flipped left to right format, but was re-released in the original right to left format in later editions. The English version of the manga also at first continued the volume numbering through the two series, such that Magic Knight Rayearth II volumes #1-3 were numbered as volumes \\"#4-6\\" (i.e., the 2000/2001 release of Magic Knight Rayearth volume 4 has the same content as the 2003/2004 re-release's Magic Knight Rayearth II volume 1). It would appear that Tokyopop has lost their license for the series, as Dark Horse Comics announced at their San Diego Comic-Con International 2009 panel that they would be publishing the series in a new omnibus edition in honor of Clamp's 20th anniversary. Dark Horse published the omnibus editions from July 6, 2011 to April 12, 2012. After Dark Horse Comics' license expired, Kodansha Comics licensed it and began releasing the series in 2 hardcover box sets containing 3 volumes each in honor of the manga's 25th anniversary in 2019. The series is also licensed in French by Pika √âdition. Magic Knight Rayearth Magic Knight Rayearth II =Anime= The anime series aired first on Japan's Yomiuri TV and on NNS in Tokyo on October 17, 1994, and ended on November 27, 1995. It was directed by Toshihiro Hirano and co-produced by Yomiuri TV and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now TMS Entertainment). The anime had 2 seasons, lasting 49 episodes altogether. The TV series was licensed in the U.S. twice, first by The Ocean Group and second by Media Blasters and was dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. The anime series was also aired on the Philippine television network ABS-CBN in 1996, dubbed in the Filipino language and airing every Sunday at 9:00 am for the first season and 10:30 am for the second season in 1997. It was popular with Filipino female children and became one of the Philippines' highest-rated anime series of the 20th century, helping to revitalize Filipino interest in anime. It was later aired on GMA Network on November 26, 2001, but on a weekday basis and with a Tagalog dub produced by Telesuccess Productions. It was released on both VHS and DVD. Discotek Media re-released the series on DVD and Blu-ray on January 31, 2017.https://www.amazon.com/Knight-Rayearth- Complete-Collection-Blu- ray/dp/B01MQVNWEL/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1538188219&sr;=8-1&keywords;=magic+knight+rayearth Anime Limited announced that they had acquired the series for release in the United Kingdom and Ireland. =OVA= A three-part OVA was released in Japan a few years after the end of the manga and the TV series (July 25, September 26, and December 10, 1997). The OVA was named simply Rayearth, and its story was quite different from the original. The characters are all the same, but the relationships, places and events changed radically. In the OVA, Hikaru, Umi and Fuu are already friends who go to the same school and will soon be leaving for high school. Suddenly, a strange fairy (which turns out to be Mokona, the creature from the original series) appears in front of them. At the same time, strange monsters and wizards start to appear in the city of Tokyo. One of them is Clef, who tries to guide the three girls in order to let them become the Magic Knights, awaken their Mashin and fight against the evil wizards from Cephiro, who are trying to invade the human world. In this version, Ferio, who is a sorcerer under Princess Emeraude's command, is not her brother. Eagle Vision fills that role instead, as well as being the main antagonist after he tricked Zagato to commit suicide in order to bring upon a false balance to Cephiro. His ties to Autozam are non-existent in this version, as he is a citizen of Cephiro from the start. He would put a spell on Emeraude to convince her that Zagato is still alive, so that the sorcerers of Cephiro can continue to exist on Earth as the two worlds would soon merge and each sorcerer would battle against the Magic Knights. Lantis is also introduced right away as being an ally to the Magic Knights and against Eagle's plans. The only other characters that are in the OVA are Ascot and Alcyone, with none of the other characters are featured. The OVA is licensed in the U.S. by Manga Entertainment, who opted to use a different New York-based voice cast for its English release, which was produced by Skypilot Entertainment. = Theme songs = ;Opening Themes Three opening themes were used in the series and one in the OVA Rayearth: Magic Knight Rayearth: *Episodes 01-20: by Naomi Tamura Magic Knight Rayearth 2: *Episodes 01-22: by *Episodes 23-29: by Naomi Tamura Media Blasters' early English DVD release used \\"Hikari to Kage o Dakishimeta Mama\\" as the opening for Magic Knight Rayearth 2 Episodes 01-22. The original openings from episodes 01-22 were included as an extra on the early DVDs, and was only in Japanese, however this isn't the case with the remastered sets, in which the dubbed openings were removed meaning, all three openings are left intact. ;Ending Themes Three ending themes were used: Magic Knight Rayearth: *Episodes 01-20: by Magic Knight Rayearth 2: *Episodes 01-22: by *Episodes 23-29: by Keiko Yoshinari Media Blasters' early English DVD release used \\"Rarabai ~ Yasashiku Dakasete ~\\" as the ending for Magic Knight Rayearth 2 Episodes 23-29. The original ending from episodes 23-29 was included as an extra on the early DVDs, and was only in Japanese, this again was eventually rectified in the remastered sets, in which, like the openings the dubbed endings were removed meaning all three endings were left intact. In the early English releases of the TV series, Sandy Fox sang both the opening and the ending themes in the English dubbed version. Rayearth: * OVA: \\"All You Need is Love\\" by Naomi Tamura = Video games = A number of video games have been released that are based on Magic Knight Rayearth. Magic Knight Rayearth, an adventure RPG set in the first TV season, was released for the Sega Saturn. It was the last officially released game for the console in the US.

The Golden Gloves is a term used to refer to the National Golden Gloves competition, but can also represent several other amateur tournaments, including regional golden gloves tournaments and other notable tournaments such as the Intercity Golden Gloves, the Chicago Golden Gloves, and the New York Golden Gloves. History Arch Ward, sports editor of the Chicago Tribune, came up with the idea of a citywide, Chicago amateur boxing tournament in 1923, and gained sponsorship from the Tribune in 1927. An annual tournament was held between Chicago and New York. In later years the idea was taken up by other cities, and a national tournament was held. Along with the New York Golden Gloves, the Chicago tournament was viewed as one of the two elite Golden Gloves Championships in the United States. Winners from selected states and regions headed to Chicago to meet in the Chicago Golden Gloves, while winners from other sections of the U.S. faced each other in the New York Golden Gloves tournaments. Champions from the Chicago tournament went on to face champions from the New York tournament in the Intercity Golden Gloves tournament, and thus the Intercity Golden Gloves served as the National Tournament of Champions held in the Square Garden Chicago and Chicago Stadium. The Intercity Golden Gloves tournament ran from 1928 to 1961, with the event being held at famed venues including the Chicago Coliseum. The National Golden GlovesThe National Golden Gloves contest began in 1962 and continues to be the most highly regarded amateur boxing tournament in the United States. It is sponsored and controlled by the Golden Gloves Association of America, Inc. Winners from 32 regional Golden Gloves competitions, coming up in regional teams of all weight classes, compete in the national competition, called the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. This is held once a year, and a new tournament site is selected annually. The U.S. Golden Gloves program is currently organized on a territorial basis to give all sections of the country representation. All tournaments are planned, promoted and directed by the Golden Gloves Charities and within the limits of the amateur boxing code. Many amateur Golden Gloves participants went on to become professional boxers, including Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Barney Ross and Iran Barkley. The Golden Gloves are open to all non-professional pugilists age 17-34 who are United States citizens. There is also a Silver Gloves amateur tournament, for amateur pugilists aged 10 to 15.

It can be done with the naked eye, through a visual enhancement device like binoculars and telescopes, by listening for bird sounds, or by watching public webcams. Birdwatching often involves a significant auditory component, as many bird species are more easily detected and identified by ear than by eye. Most birdwatchers pursue this activity for recreational or social reasons, unlike ornithologists, who engage in the study of birds using formal scientific methods. Birding, birdwatching, and twitching A birdwatching tower in Hankasalmi, Finland The first recorded use of the term birdwatcher was in 1891; bird was introduced as a verb in 1918. The term birding was also used for the practice of fowling or hunting with firearms as in Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor (1602): \\"She laments sir... her husband goes this morning a-birding.\\"Moss 2004:33 The terms birding and birdwatching are today used by some interchangeably, although some participants prefer birding, partly because it includes the auditory aspects of enjoying birds. In North America, many birders differentiate themselves from birdwatchers, and the term birder is unfamiliar to most lay people. At the most basic level, the distinction is perceived as one of dedication or intensity, though this is a subjective differentiation. Generally, self-described birders perceive themselves to be more versed in minutiae like identification (aural and visual), molt, distribution, migration timing, and habitat usage. Whereas these dedicated birders may often travel specifically in search of birds, birdwatchers have been described by some enthusiasts as having a more limited scope, perhaps not venturing far from their own yards or local parks to view birds. Indeed, in 1969 a Birding Glossary appeared in Birding magazine which gave the following definitions: Twitching is a British term used to mean \\"the pursuit of a previously located rare bird.\\" In North America it is more often called chasing. The term twitcher, sometimes misapplied as a synonym for birder, is reserved for those who travel long distances to see a rare bird that would then be ticked, or counted on a list. The term originated in the 1950s, when it was used for the nervous behaviour of Howard Medhurst, a British birdwatcher. Prior terms for those who chased rarities were pot-hunter, tally-hunter, or tick-hunter. The main goal of twitching is often to accumulate species on one's lists. Some birders engage in competition to accumulate the longest species list. The act of the pursuit itself is referred to as a twitch or a chase. A rare bird that stays long enough for people to see it is twitchable or chaseable. Twitching is highly developed in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Finland and Sweden. The size of these countries makes it possible to travel throughout them quickly and with relative ease. The most popular twitches in the UK have drawn large crowds; for example, approximately 2,500 people travelled to Kent, to view a golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), which is native to North America. Twitchers have developed their own vocabulary. For example, a twitcher who fails to see a rare bird has dipped out; if other twitchers do see the bird, he may feel gripped off. Suppression is the act of concealing news of a rare bird from other twitchers. Many birders maintain a life list, that is, a list of all of the species they have seen in their life, usually with details about the sighting such as date and location. The American Birding Association has specific rules about how a bird species may be documented and recorded in such a list if it is submitted to the ABA; however, the criteria for the personal recording of these lists are very subjective. Some birders \\"count\\" species they have identified audibly, while others only record species that they have identified visually. Some also maintain a country list, state list, county list, yard list, year list, or any combination of these. The history of birdwatching Bird watching photographers, New South Wales, June 1921, AH Chisholm The early interest in observing birds for their aesthetic rather than utilitarian (mainly food) value is traced to the late 18th century in the works of Gilbert White, Thomas Bewick, George Montagu and John Clare.Moss 2004:10 The study of birds and natural history in general became increasingly prevalent in Britain during the Victorian Era, often associated with collection, eggs and later skins being the artifacts of interest. Wealthy collectors made use of their contacts in the colonies to obtain specimens from around the world. It was only in the late 19th century that the call for bird protection began leading to the rising popularity of observations on living birds. The Audubon Society was started to protect birds from the growing trade in feathers in the United States while the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds began in Britain.Moss 2004:72 The phrase \\"bird watching\\" appeared for the first time as the title of a book \\"Bird Watching\\" by Edmund Selous in 1901.Moss 2004:88 In North America, the identification of birds, once thought possible only by shooting was made possible by the emergence of optics and field identification guides. The earliest field guide in the US was Birds through an Opera Glass (1889) by Florence Bailey. Birding in North America was focused in the early and mid-20th century in the eastern seaboard region, and was influenced by the works of Ludlow Griscom and later Roger Tory Peterson. Bird Neighbors (1897) by Neltje Blanchan was an early birding book which sold over 250,000 copies.Shearin, Gloria. 2008. Neltje Blanchan. In: Patterson, D., Thompson, R., Bryson, S., et al., Early American Nature Writers. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, . pp.62‚Äì69. It was illustrated with color photographs of stuffed birds.Dunlap, Thomas R. 2011. In the Field, Among the Feathered: A History of Birders & Their Guides, Oxford University Press, . p. 47. The organization and networking of those interested in birds began through organizations like the Audubon Society that was against the killing of birds and the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU). The rising popularity of the car increased the mobility of birdwatchers and this made new locations accessible to those interested in birds.Moss 2004:104‚Äì106 Networks of birdwatchers in the UK began to form in the late 1930s under the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). The BTO saw the potential to produce scientific results through the networks, unlike the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) which like the Audubon Society originated from the bird protection movement. Like the AOU in North America, the BOU had a focus mainly in collection based taxonomy. The BOU changed focus to ecology and behaviour only in the 1940s. The BTO movement towards 'organized birdwatching', was opposed by the RSPB which claimed that the 'scientification' of the pastime was 'undesirable'. This stand was to change only in 1936 when the RSPB was taken over by Tom Harrisson and others. Harrisson was instrumental in the organization of pioneering surveys of the great crested grebe.Moss 2004:128 Increased mobility of birdwatchers ensured that books like Where to Watch Birds by John Gooders became best-sellers.Moss 2004:233‚Äì234 By the 1960s air-travel became feasible and long distance holiday destinations opened up with the result that by 1965, Britain's first birding tour company, Ornitholidays was started by Lawrence Holloway.Moss 2004:234‚Äì235 Travelling far away also led to problems in name usage, British birds like \\"wheatear\\", \\"heron\\" and \\"swallow\\" needed adjectives to differentiate them in places where there were several related species.Moss 2004:250 The falling cost of air-travel made flying to remote birding destinations a possibility for a large number of people towards the 1980s. The need for global guides to birds became more relevant and one of the biggest projects that began was the Handbook of the Birds of the World which started in the 1990s with Josep del Hoyo, a country doctor in Catalonia, Jordi Sargatal, and ornithologist Andy Elliott.Moss 2004:252‚Äì253 Initially, birdwatching was a hobby undertaken in developed countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Since the second half of the 20th century an increasing number of people in developing countries have engaged in this activity, such as in the Degua Tembien district of Ethiopia. Transnational birding has played an important role in this, as birders in developing countries usually take up the pastime under the influence of foreign cultures with a history of birding. Economic and environmental impact In the 20th century most of the birding activity in North America was done on the east coast. The publication of Roger Tory Peterson's field guide in 1934 led to the initial increase in birding. Binoculars, an essential piece of birding equipment, became more easily available after World War II, making the hobby of birding more widely accessible. The practice of travelling long distances to see rare bird species was aided by the rising popularity of cars.Moss 2004:265 About 4% of North Americans were interested in birding in the 1970s and in the mid-1980s at least 11% were found to watch birds at least 20 days of the year. An estimate of 61 million birders was made in the late 1980s. The income level of birders has been found to be well above average. The 2000 publication of \\"The Sibley Guide to Birds\\" sold 500,000 copies by 2002. but it was found that the number of birdwatchers rose but there appeared to be a drop in birdwatching in the backyard. According to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study, birders contributed $36 billion to the US economy in 2006, and one fifth (20%) of all Americans are identified as birdwatchers. North American birders were estimated to have spent as much as US$32 billion in 2001. The spending is on the rise around the world. Ku≈ücenneti National Park (KNP) at Lake Manyas, a Ramsar site in Turkey was estimated to attract birders who spent as much as US$103,320,074 annually. Guided bird tours have become a major business with at least 127 companies offering tours worldwide. An average trip to a less- developed country costs $4000 per person and includes about 12 participants for each of 150 trips a year. It has been suggested that this economic potential needs to be tapped for conservation. One of the expectations of ecotourism is that the travels of birders to a place will contribute to the improvement of the local economy which and in turn ensure that the environment is valued and protected. Numerous positive and negative impacts of birding have been identified. Impacts include disturbance to birds, the environment, local cultures and the economy. Methods to reduce negative impact and improve the value to conservation are the subject of research. Activities Birdwatchers at J.N. \\"Ding\\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge, Sanibel, Florida Many birders occupy themselves with observing local species (birding in their \\"local patch\\"), but may also make specific trips to observe birds in other locales. The most active times of the year for birding in temperate zones are during the spring or fall migrations when the greatest variety of birds may be seen. On these occasions, large numbers of birds travel north or south to wintering or nesting locations. Early mornings are typically better as the birds are more active and vocal making them easier to spot. Certain locations such as the local patch of forest, wetland and coast may be favoured according to the location and season. Seawatching, or pelagic birding, is a type of birding where observers based at a coastal watch point, such as a headland, watch birds flying over the sea. This is one form of pelagic birding, by which pelagic bird species are viewed. Another way birders view pelagic species is from seagoing vessels. Weather plays an important role in the occurrence of rare birds. In Britain, suitable wind conditions may lead to drift migration, and an influx of birds from the east. In North America, birds caught in the tail-end of a hurricane may be blown inland. The Strait of Messina, Sicily, a classic migration bottleneck, seen from the Peloritani mountains =Monitoring= Birdwatchers may take part in censuses of bird populations and migratory patterns which are sometimes specific to individual species. These birdwatchers may also count all birds in a given area, as in the Christmas Bird Count or follow carefully designed study protocols. This kind of citizen science can assist in identifying environmental threats to the well-being of birds or, conversely, in assessing outcomes of environmental management initiatives intended to ensure the survival of at-risk species or encourage the breeding of species for aesthetic or ecological reasons. This more scientific side of the hobby is an aspect of ornithology, coordinated in the UK by the British Trust for Ornithology. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology hosts many citizen-science projects to track the number and distribution of bird species across North America. These surveys help scientists note major changes from year to year which may occur as a result of climate change, disease, predation, and other factors. =Environmental education= Moroccan students watching birds at Nador's lagoon as a part of environmental education activities organized by the Spanish Ornithological Society Due to their accessibility and ubiquity, birds are a useful tool for environmental education and awareness on environmental issues. Birds easily transmit values on respect to nature and the fragility of ecosystems. =Competition= Birdwatchers watching Britain's fifth-ever white-tailed lapwing at Caerlaverock, Scotland, 6 June 2007 Birding as a competitive event is organized in some parts of the world. The birding competitions encourage individuals or teams to accumulate large numbers of species within a specified time or area with special rules. Some birdwatchers will also compete by attempting to increase their life list, national list, state list, provincial list, county list, or year list. Such events have been criticised, especially those claimed to aid conservation when they may actually mask serious environmental issues, or where competitive birding involves large amounts of driving. The American Birding Association was originally started as a club for \\"listers\\", but it now serves a much broader audience. Still, the ABA continues to publish an official annual report of North American list standings. Competitive birdwatching events include: *Big Day: teams have 24 hours to identify as many species as possible. *Big Year: like a big day, but contestants are individuals, and need to be prepared to invest a great deal of time and money. *Big Sit or Big Stay: birdwatchers must see birds from a circle of prescribed diameter (e.g.: 17-footDunne, P. (2007). Big Day Big Stay. Birder's World, 21(5), 18‚Äì21.). Once birds are spotted, birdwatchers can leave the circle to confirm the identity, but new birds seen may not be counted. Networking and organization Prominent national and continental organizations concerned with birding include the British Trust for Ornithology and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the United Kingdom, and the American Birding Association and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in North America. Many statewide or local Audubon organizations are also quite active in the United States, as are many provincial and local organizations in Canada. BirdLife International is an important global alliance of bird conservation organizations. Many countries and smaller regions (states/provinces) have \\"rarities committees\\" to check, accept or reject reports of rare birds made by birders. Equipment and technology Birders using a tower hide to gain views over foreground vegetation. Bay of Liminka, south of Oulu, Finland. Equipment commonly used for birding includes binoculars, a spotting scope with tripod, a smartphone, a notepad, and one or more field guides. Hides (known as blinds in North America) or observation towers are often used to conceal the observers from birds, and/or to improve viewing conditions. Virtually all optics manufacturers offer specific binoculars for birding, and some have even geared their whole brand to birders. =Sound equipment= Recognition of bird vocalizations is an important part of a birder's toolkit. Sound information can assist in the locating, watching, identification and sexing of birds. Recent developments in audio technology have seen recording and reproduction devices shrink in both size and price, making them accessible to a greater portion of the birding community. The non-linear nature of digital audio technology has also made selecting and accessing the required recordings much more flexible than tape- based models. It is now possible to take a recording of every birdcall you are likely to encounter in a given area out into the field stored on a device that will slip into your pocket, and to retrieve calls for playback and comparison in any order you choose. =Photography= Photography has always been a part of birding, but in the past the cost of cameras with super-telephoto lenses made this a minority, often semi-professional, interest. The advent of affordable digital cameras, which can be used in conjunction with a spotting scope or binoculars (using the technique of afocal photography, referred to by the neologism \\"digiscoping\\" or sometimes digibinning for binoculars), have made this a much more widespread aspect of the hobby. =Videography= As with the arrival of affordable digital cameras, the development of more compact and affordable digital video cameras has made them more attractive and accessible to the birding community. Cross-over, non-linear digital models now exist that take high quality stills at acceptable resolutions, as well as being able to record and play audio and video. The ability to easily capture and reproduce not only the visual characteristics of a bird, but also its patterns of movement and its sound, has wide applications for birders in the field. =Portable media players= This class of product includes devices that can play (some can also record) a range of digital media, typically video, audio and still image files. Many modern digital cameras, mobile phones, and camcorders can be classified as portable media players. With the ability to store and play large quantities of information, pocket-sized devices allow a full birding multimedia library to be taken into the field and mobile Internet access makes obtaining and transmitting information possible in near real time. =Remote birdwatching= New technologies are allowing birdwatching activities to take place over the Internet, using robotic camera installations and mobile phones set up in remote wildlife areas. Projects such as CONE allow users to observe and photograph birds over the web; similarly, robotic cameras set up in largely inhospitable areas are being used to attempt the first photographs of the rare ivory-billed woodpecker. These systems represent new technologies in the birdwatcher's toolkit. =Communication= In the early 1950s the only way of communicating new bird sightings was through the postal system and it was generally too late for the recipients to act on the information. In 1953 James Ferguson-Lees began broadcasting rare bird news on the radio in Eric Simms' Countryside program but this did not catch on. In the 1960s people began using the telephone and some people became hubs for communication. In the 1970s some cafes, like the one in Cley, Norfolk run by Nancy Gull, became centers for meeting and communication. This was replaced by telephone hotline services like \\"Birdline\\" and \\"Bird Information Service\\".Moss 2004:267‚Äì275 With the advent of the World-Wide Web, birders have been using the Internet to convey information; this can be via mailing lists, forums, bulletin-boards, web-based databases and other media. While most birding lists are geographic in scope, there are special-interest lists that cater to bird-identification, 'twitchers', seabirds and raptor enthusiasts to name but a few. Messages can range from the serious to trivial, notifying others of rarities, questioning the taxonomy or identification of a species, discussing field guides and other resources, asking for advice and guidance, or organizing groups to help save habitats. Occasional postings are mentioned in academic journals and therefore can be a valuable resource for professional and amateur birders alike. One of the oldest, Birdchat (based in the US) probably has the most subscribers, followed by the English-language fork of Eurobirdnet, Birding-Aus from Australia, SABirdnet from South Africa and Orientalbirding. Several websites allow users to submit lists of birds seen,UK Life & Year Lists Online Birdax while others collate and produce seasonal statistics, distribution maps. =Code of conduct= As the numbers of birdwatchers increases, there is growing concern about the impact of birdwatching on the birds and their habitat. Birdwatching etiquette is evolving in response to this concern. Some examples of birdwatching etiquette include promoting the welfare of birds and their environment, limiting use of photography, pishing and playback devices to mitigate stress caused to birds, maintaining a distance away from nests and nesting colonies, and respecting private property.American Birding Association ABA ethics The lack of definite evidence, except arguably in the form of photographs, makes birding records difficult to prove but birdwatchers strive to build trust in their identification. One of the few major disputes was the case of the Hastings Rarities. Socio-psychology Ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen considers birdwatching to be an expression of the male hunting instinct while Simon Baron-Cohen links it with a male tendency for \\"systemizing\\". There have been suggestions that identification of birds may be a form of gaining status which has been compared with Kula valuables noted in Papua New Guinean cultures. A study of the motivations for birdwatching in New York concluded that initial motivations were largely similar in males and females, but males who participate actively in birding are more motivated by \\"sharing knowledge\\" with others, and active female birders are more motivated by their \\"intellectual\\" interest in studying birds, and by the \\"challenge\\" of identifying new and rare birds and improving their skills. A study suggests that males leaned towards competitive birding while females preferred recreational birdwatching. While the representation of women has always been low,Moss 2004:316‚Äì330 it has been pointed out that nearly 90% of all birdwatchers in the United States are white with only a few African Americans. Other minority groups have formed organizations to support fellow birders and these include the Gay birders and the Disabled Birders Association. The study of birdwatching has been of interest to students of the sociology of science. Famous birdwatchers There are about 10,000 species of bird and only a small number of people have seen more than 7000. Many birdwatchers have spent their entire lives trying to see all the bird species of the world. The first person who started this is said to be Stuart Keith.Moss 2004:261 Some birders have been known to go to great lengths and many have lost their lives in the process. Phoebe Snetsinger spent her family inheritance travelling to various parts of the world while suffering from a malignant melanoma, surviving an attack and rape in New Guinea before dying in a road accident in Madagascar. She saw as many as 8,400 species. The birdwatcher David Hunt who was leading a bird tour in Corbett National Park was killed by a tiger in February 1985. In 1971 Ted Parker travelled around North America and saw 626 species in a year. This record was beaten by Kenn Kaufman in 1973 who travelled 69,000 miles and saw 671 species and spent less than a thousand dollars.Moss 2004:240‚Äì241 Ted Parker was killed in an air-crash in Ecuador.Moss 2004:242 In 2012 Tom Gullick, an Englishman who lives in Spain, became the first birdwatcher to log over 9,000 species. In 2008 two British birders, Alan Davies and Ruth Miller, gave up their jobs, sold their home and put everything they owned into a year-long global birdwatching adventure about which they a wrote a book called The Biggest Twitch. They logged their 4431st species on 31 October 2008. Noah Strycker recorded 6,042 species during 2015, overtaking Davies and Miller. In 2016 Arjan Dwarshuis became the world-record holder for most species seen during a big year. Dwarshuis logged 6852 bird species in 40 different countries. Birdwatching literature, field guides and television programs have been popularized by birders like Pete Dunne and Bill Oddie. In media The 2011 film The Big Year depicted three birders competing in an American Birding Association Area big year.

While the game's title as it was released in English refers to the 14th century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (‰∏âÂúãÊºîÁæ©) by Luo Guanzhong, the title as it was released in Japan and Chinese regions refers to the 3rd century historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms (‰∏âÂúãÂøó) by Chen Shou.  Overview  The series are based on the romanticized Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel and the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms, the storyline takes place during the Han Dynasty in China with many warring factions that included the Shu Han, Cao Wei and Eastern Wu kingdoms. Gameplay revolves around managing numerical statistics, each representing an attribute of a city or a character. A city is described by statistics such as stored grain supplies, vulnerability to disasters such as floods and earthquakes, treasury funds, domestic affairs and populace loyalty. Characters are numerically characterized by their leadership abilities, melee prowess, intellects and loyalty, as well as special traits or even magical abilities that can be called upon whether during wartime, diplomacy or domestic affairs. Players can increase these numbers before waging war on neighbouring territories or intending diplomatic efforts. While generally presented as a turn-based strategy game, the seventh, eighth and tenth editions offer role- playing features, allowing the player to play as a rank-and-file character instead of leading a kingdom. Several spin-offs based on the series include the tactical action hack and slash video game Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Tactics which is a hybrid of Dynasty Warriors and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, as well as the three tactical role-playing games Sangokushi Eiketsuden (Liu Bei), Sangokushi Koumeiden (Zhuge Liang), and Sangokushi Sousouden (Cao Cao).

It asserts that the Persian language is the lingua franca of the Iranian nation and as such, bound to be used through all official government communications and schooling system. In addition, the constitution also recognizes the Arabic language as the language of Islam, giving it a formal status as the language of religion, and regulates its spreading within the Iranian national curriculum. Due to the nation's unique social and ethnic diversity, the constitution also acknowledges and permits the use of minority languages in the mass media as well as within the schools, in order to teach their literature. The minority languages of Iran do not receive a formal status and are not officially regulated by the authorities.Riazi, Abdolmehdi. The Four Language Stages in the History of Iran. In: Martin, Peter W; Lin, Angel (Eds.). Decolonisation, Globalisation: Language-in-education Policy and Practice. (Buffalo: Multilingual Matters, Ltd. 2005). pp. 98-114. The first legislation which granted the Persian language its status was initiated back in 1906, as part of an electoral law that positioned it as the official language of the state of Iran, its government, its political institutions and its legal system. In the course of time this enactment was followed by others, which eventually led to a monolingual policy by the Iranian regime. Perceiving multilingualism as a threat to the nation's unity and territorial integrity, and seeing the need to restrict minority languages‚Äô use and to advance the Persian language's hegemony, Iran's language policy consists of a non-translation outline as well: all government, administration and educational settings are obliged to use merely Persian for any written communication. That includes political institutions (i.e. the Iranian Parliament), official bureaucratic communication (forms, signage etc.) and schooling (all children from the age of six and up are exposed only to Persian as the language of teaching and learning and of textbooks within the public school system). In other words, the Iranian authorities holds that minorities need to learn the Iranian vernacular to an extent that will allow them to communicate with state institutions.Haddadian-Moghaddam, Esmaeil; Meylaerts, Reine. What about Translation? Beyond ‚ÄúPersianization‚Äù as the Language Policy in Iran. Iranian Studies, Vol. 78, No. 6 (2015). pp. 851-870. With regard to the Iranian Language Planning, among the institutions accountable for advancing the Iranian Language Planning (e.g. Ministry of Education and Ministry of Science, Research and Technology) is the Academy of Persian Language and Literature, which was established on 1935, under Reza Shah Pahlavi. Constantly seeking to revise and elaborate the nation's official language, this institute focuses on the linguistics of the Persian language and on the internal aspects of Language Planning, rather than on minority languages use within the Iranian society. Other aspects of Language Planning (e.g. sociolinguistic or functional literacy) have not been assigned to a formal institute and are currently handled free of any official master plan, by the educational ministries.Iran's main languages  Languages of Iran  Different publications have reported different statistics for the languages of Iran.

An Wang was an important contributor to the development of magnetic core memory. Wang Laboratories Wang founded Wang Laboratories in June 1951 as a sole proprietorship. The first years were lean and Wang raised $50,000 working capital by selling one third of the company to a machine tools manufacturer Warner & Swasey Company. In 1955, when the core memory patent was issued, Wang sold it to IBM for $500,000 and incorporated Wang Laboratories with Ge-Yao Chu, a schoolmate. The company grew slowly and in 1964 sales reached $1,000,000. Wang began making desktop electronic calculators with digital displays, including a centralised calculator with remote terminals for group use. By 1970 the company had sales of $27 million and 1,400 employees. They began manufacturing word processors in 1974, copying the already popular Xerox Redactron word processor, a single-user, cassette-based product. In 1976, they started marketing a multi-user, display-based product, based on the Zilog Z80 processor. Typical installations had a master unit (supplying disk storage) connected to intelligent diskless slaves which the operators used. Connections were via dual coax using differential signaling in an 11-bit asynchronous ASCII format clocked at 4.275 MHz. This product became the market leader in the word processing industry. In addition to calculators and word processors, Wang's company diversified into minicomputers in the early 1970s. The Wang 2200 was one of the first desktop computers with a large CRT display and ran a fast hardwired BASIC interpreter. The Wang VS system was a multiuser minicomputer whose instruction set was very close to the design of IBM's System/370. It was not binary-compatible because register usage conventions and system call interfaces were different. The Wang VS serial terminals could be used in data processing mode and word processing mode. They were user- programmable in data-processing mode and used the same word processing software as the earlier dedicated word processing systems. In 1984, Wang and his family owned about 55 percent of the company stock, and Forbes magazine, estimating his worth at $1.6 billion, ranked him as the fifth richest American. Wang Laboratories, which in 1989 once employed over 30,000 people, was headquartered in Tewksbury, Massachusetts and later Lowell, Massachusetts. When Wang looked to retire from actively running his company in 1986, he insisted upon handing over the corporate reins to his son Fred Wang. Hard times ensued for the company and the elder Wang was eventually forced to remove his son in 1989. Later years An Wang also founded the Wang Institute of Graduate Studies in Tyngsborough, Massachusetts which offered a graduate program in software engineering. He made substantial donations to this organization, including the proceeds of his autobiography, Lessons. However, enrollment remained low, and in 1987, after nearly a decade of operation, Wang decided to discontinue funding the institution and transferred ownership of the campus to Boston University. An Wang also made a substantial contribution for the restoration of a Boston landmark, which was then called the Metropolitan Theatre. The \\"Met\\" was renamed in 1983 as The Wang Theatre, and the Metropolitan Center became known as the Wang Center for the Performing Arts. Wang donated $4 million to Massachusetts General Hospital's ambulatory care center, which was renamed to the Wang Building. Wang was one of twelve recipients of the Medal of Liberty in 1986. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1988. The An Wang Middle School in Lowell, Massachusetts, is named in his honor, as is the An Wang Professorship of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Harvard University, held by Roger W. Brockett and Hanspeter Pfister, the An Wang Professorship of Computer Science at Brown University, held by John E. Savage, and the Wang Professorship of Cognitive and Neural Systems at Boston University, held by Stephen Grossberg; see sites.bu.edu/steveg. An Wang died of cancer in 1990. He and his wife, Lorraine (Chur) Wang, lived in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Lorraine Wang died on March 1, 2016, at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts. They had three children.

The authorship remains a matter of speculation. It has received various degrees of interest ranging from praise to criticism for its religious and science content, its unusual length, and its lack of a known author. The text introduces the word \\"Urantia\\" as the name of the planet Earth and states that its intent is to \\"present enlarged concepts and advanced truth.\\" The book aims to unite religion, science and philosophy, and its enormous amount of material about science is unique among literature claimed to be presented by celestial beings. Among other topics, the book discusses the origin and meaning of life, mankind's place in the universe, the relationship between God and people, and the life of Jesus. The Urantia Foundation, a U.S.-based non-profit group, first published The Urantia Book in 1955. In 2001, a jury found that the English-language book's copyright was no longer valid in the United States after 1983. The English text became a public domain work in the United States, and in 2006 the international copyright expired.  Background  = Authorship = William S. Sadler Lena K. Sadler The exact circumstances of the origin of The Urantia Book are unknown. The book and its publishers do not name a human author. Instead, it is written as if directly presented by numerous celestial beings appointed to the task of providing an \\"epochal\\" religious revelation. As early as 1911, William S. Sadler and his wife Lena Sadler, physicians in Chicago and well known in the community, are said to have been approached by a neighbor who was concerned because she would occasionally find her husband in a deep sleep and breathing abnormally. She reported that she was unable to wake him at these times. The Sadlers came to observe the episodes, and over time, the individual produced verbal communications that claimed to be from \\"student visitor\\" spiritual beings. This changed sometime in early 1925 with a \\"voluminous handwritten document,\\" which from then on became the regular method of purported communication. The individual was never identified publicly but has been described as \\"a hard-boiled business man, member of the board of trade and stock exchange.\\" The Sadlers were both respected physicians, and William Sadler was a sometime debunker of paranormal claims. In 1929, he published a book called The Mind at Mischief, in which he explained the fraudulent methods of mediums and how self-deception leads to psychic claims. He wrote in an appendix that there were two cases that he had not explained to his satisfaction: > The other exception has to do with a rather peculiar case of psychic > phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify. ... I was brought in > contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my > observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of > the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who > made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that > it is not one of ordinary trance. ... This man is utterly unconscious, > wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it > subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house > for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities. ... > Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the > written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. > Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his > habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire > philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find > anything of its nature in existence. In 1923, a group of Sadler's friends, former patients, and colleagues began meeting for Sunday philosophical and religious discussions, but became interested in the strange communications when Sadler mentioned the case at their fourth meeting and read samples at their request. Shortly afterwards, a communication reportedly was received about which this group would be allowed to devise questions and that answers would be given by celestial beings through the \\"contact personality.\\" Sadler presented this development to the group, and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness, but their claim is that it resulted in the appearance of answers in the form of fully written papers. They became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions, until all papers now collected together as The Urantia Book were obtained. The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others. Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book. The Sadlers and others involved, now all deceased, claimed that the papers of the book were physically materialized from 1925 until 1935 in a way that was not understood even by them, with the first two parts being completed in 1934 and the third and fourth in 1935. The last Forum gathering was in 1942. After the last of Part IV was obtained in 1935, an additional period of time supposedly took place where requests for clarifications resulted in revisions. Sadler and his son William (Bill) Sadler, Jr. at one point wrote a draft introduction and were told that they could not add their introduction. The Foreword was then \\"received.\\" The communications purportedly continued for another two decades while members of the Forum studied the book in depth, and according to Sadler and others, permission to publish it was given to them in 1955. The Urantia Foundation was formed in 1950 as a tax-exempt educational society in Illinois, and through privately raised funds, the book was published on October 12, 1955. Only the members of the Contact Commission witnessed the activities of the \\"sleeping subject\\", and only they knew his identity. The individual is claimed to have been kept anonymous in order to prevent undesirable future veneration or reverence for him. Martin Gardner states that an explanation concerning the origin of the book more plausible than celestial beings is that the Contact Commission, particularly William Sadler, was responsible. Gardner's conclusion is that a man named Wilfred Kellogg was the sleeping subject and authored the work from his subconscious mind, with William Sadler subsequently editing and authoring parts. Brad Gooch believes Sadler wrote the book, possibly with help from others on the Contact Commission. A statistical analysis using the Mosteller and Wallace methods of stylometry indicates at least nine authors were involved, and by comparatively analyzing the book against The Mind at Mischief, does not indicate authorship or extensive editing by Sadler, without ruling out the possibility of limited edits. = Copyright status = In 1991, after having compiled an index of The Urantia Book and distributed free copies via computer disk and printouts, Kristen Maaherra was sued by the Urantia Foundation for violating their copyright on the book. In 1995, Maaherra won a Summary Judgment declaring the Urantia Foundation's copyright renewal invalid. Upon appeal, the judgment was reversed and awarded to the Urantia Foundation. Four years later, in 1999, Harry McMullan III and the Michael Foundation published a book, Jesus‚ÄìA New Revelation, which included verbatim 76 of the 196 papers included in The Urantia Book. McMullan and the Michael Foundation subsequently sought a legal declaration that the Urantia Foundation's US copyright in The Urantia Book was either invalid or, alternatively, that the copyright had not been infringed upon. Urantia Foundation's copyright was held to have expired in 1983 because the book was deemed to have been neither a composite work nor a commissioned work for hire. These two arguments having been rejected, a U.S. court held that, since the Conduit had died prior to 1983, only the Conduit's heirs would have been eligible to renew the copyright in 1983 and, since they had not done so, the Urantia Foundation's copyright on the book had expired and the book had therefore passed into the public domain. This decision was upheld on appeal.  Overview  The Urantia Book is approximately 2,000 pages long, and consists of a body of 196 \\"papers\\" divided in four parts, and an introductory foreword: * Part I, titled \\"The Central and Superuniverses,\\" addresses what the authors consider the highest levels of creation, including the eternal and infinite \\"Universal Father,\\" his Trinity associates, and the \\"Isle of Paradise.\\" * Part II, \\"The Local Universe,\\" describes the origin, administration, and personalities of the local universe of \\"Nebadon.\\" the part of the cosmos where Earth resides. It presents narratives on the inhabitants of local universes and their work as it is coordinated with a scheme of spiritual ascension and progression of different orders of beings, including humans, angels, and others. * Part III, \\"The History of Urantia,\\" compiles a broad history of the Earth, presenting a purported explanation of the origin, evolution, and destiny of the world and its inhabitants. Topics include Adam and Eve, Melchizedek, essays on the concept of the Thought Adjuster, \\"Religion in Human Experience,\\" and \\"Personality Survival.\\" * Part IV, \\"The Life and Teachings of Jesus,\\" is the largest part at 775 pages, and is often noted as the most accessible and most impressive, narrating a detailed biography of Jesus that includes his childhood, teenage years, family life, and public ministry, as well as the events that led to his crucifixion, death, and resurrection. Its papers continue about appearances after he rose, Pentecost and, finally, \\"The Faith of Jesus.\\" = Nature of God = According to The Urantia Book, God is the creator and upholder of all reality‚Äîan omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, infinite, and eternal spirit personality. The most fundamental teaching about God in the book is that he is a Father. \\"The face which the Infinite turns toward all universe personalities is the face of a Father, the Universal Father of love.\\" God, according to the book, is one Deity who functions on a range of different levels of reality, both personal and impersonal. God is taught to exist in a Trinity of three perfectly individualized persons who are co-equal: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. These persons are referred to by additional titles in the book, primarily as the \\"Universal Father,\\" \\"Eternal Son,\\" and \\"Infinite Spirit.\\" While stating that the concept of one God in three persons is difficult to fully understand, the book says that the idea: \\"...in no manner violates the truth of the divine unity. The three personalities of Paradise Deity are, in all universe reality reactions and in all creature relations, as one.\\" The Father, Son, and Spirit are considered \\"existential\\" persons of Deity, those in existence from the eternal past to the eternal future. In addition, three persons of Deity are described who are \\"experiential,\\" or incomplete and in the process of actualizing: God the Supreme; God the Ultimate; and God the Absolute. Of these three, God the Supreme, or \\"the Supreme Being,\\" is given the most explanation, as the person of Deity evolving in time and space to unify finite reality and the infinite. The persons of God the Ultimate and God the Absolute are considered to be remote from the possibility of comprehension and are covered on a limited basis. Many types of celestial beings are enumerated in the book, and one of particular note is a joint \\"offspring\\" of the Universal Father and Eternal Son called a \\"Creator Son.\\" A divine Creator Son is considered the highest personification of the Universal Father and Eternal Son that is possible for people to know and: \\"...is, to all practical intents and purposes, God.\\" Jesus of Nazareth is identified as a Creator Son who incarnated on Earth, and the central theme of the book's section recounting his life and teachings is that the religion he preached is the highest known to the world. The final paper states: = God and the individual = God is described as the Father of each individual, and through the direct gift of a fragment of his eternal spirit, called a Thought Adjuster, is said to be able to guide the individual toward an increased understanding of him. The Thought Adjuster is a central teaching of the book and is also referred to as a \\"Mystery Monitor\\" and \\"indwelling presence,\\" as well as a \\"divine spark.\\" The idea is compared within the book to the Hindu atman and the ancient Egyptian ka. In relation to biblical traditions, the Thought Adjuster is said to be the meaning behind the phrases \\"being made in God's image\\" and the \\"kingdom of God is within you\\": Each person is said to receive one such fragment at the time of his or her first independent moral decision, on average around the age of five years and 10 months. The Adjuster then serves noncoercively as a divine partner in the mind of the individual for the rest of life, and to the extent that a person consents with their free will to want to find God, it leads the person toward more mature, spiritualized thinking. A person's Thought Adjuster is described as distinct from either the soul or the conscience. In The Urantia Book's teachings, the degree to which a human mind chooses to accept its Adjuster's guidance becomes the degree to which a person's soul \\"grows\\" and becomes a reality that can then survive death. The soul is in essence an embryonic spiritual development, one parental factor being the divine Adjuster and the other being the human will. The book says: \\"But you yourself are mostly unconscious of this inner ministry. You are quite incapable of distinguishing the product of your own material intellect from that of the conjoint activities of your soul and the Adjuster.\\" The book is strongly fideistic and teaches that neither science nor logic will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of God, arguing that faith is necessary to become conscious of God's presence in human experience, the Thought Adjuster. Persistently embracing sin is considered the same as rejecting the leadings of the Adjuster, rejecting the will of God. Constant selfishness and sinful choosing lead eventually to iniquity and full identification with unrighteousness, and since unrighteousness is unreal, it results in the eventual annihilation of the individual's identity. Personalities like this become \\"as if they never were.\\" The book says that: \\"...in the last analysis, such sin-identified individuals have destroyed themselves by becoming wholly unreal through their embrace of iniquity.\\" The concepts of Hell and reincarnation are not taught. The book says that a person ultimately is destined to fuse with his or her divine fragment and become one inseparable entity with it as the final goal of faith. Uniting with the Adjuster fragment is the \\"reward of the ages,\\" the moment when a human personality has successfully and unalterably won eternal life, described as typically taking place in the afterlife, but also a possibility during earthly life. The result during human life is a \\"fusion flash,\\" with the material body consumed in a fiery light and the soul \\"translated\\" to the afterlife. The Hebrew prophet Elijah being taken to heaven without death in \\"chariots of fire\\" is said to be a rare example in recorded history of a person who translated instead of experiencing death. After a person fuses with his or her fragment of God, \\"then will begin your real life, the ascending life, to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule.\\" A person continues as an ascending citizen in the universe and travels through numerous worlds on a long pilgrimage of growth and learning that eventually leads to God and residence on Paradise. Mortals who reach this stage are called \\"finaliters.\\" The book goes on to discuss the potential destinies of these \\"glorified mortals.\\" The book regards human life on earth as a \\"short and intense test,\\" and the afterlife as a continuation of training that begins in material life. The \\"religion of Jesus\\" is considered to be practiced by way of loving God the Father, thereby learning to love each person the way Jesus loves people; that is, recognizing the \\"fatherhood of God and its correlated truth, the brotherhood of man,\\" resulting in unselfish service to others. = Cosmology = The book describes that at the center of the cosmos is the stationary Isle of Paradise‚Äîthe dwelling place of God‚Äîwith Paradise being surrounded by \\"Havona,\\" an eternal universe containing a billion perfect worlds, around which seven incomplete and evolutionary \\"superuniverses\\" circle. The word \\"universe\\" in the book is used to denote a number of different scales of organization. A \\"superuniverse\\" is roughly the size of a galaxy or group of galaxies, and the seven superuniverses along with Paradise-Havona are together designated as the \\"grand universe.\\" A \\"local universe\\" is a portion of a superuniverse, with 100,000 local universes being in each superuniverse. Beyond the seven superuniverses, uninhabited \\"outer space levels\\" are described. The term \\"master universe\\" refers to what in modern usage would be the total universe‚Äîall existing matter and space taken as a whole. Urantia is said to be located in a remote local universe named \\"Nebadon,\\" which itself is part of superuniverse number seven, \\"Orvonton.\\" The physical size of a local universe is not directly stated, but each is said to have up to 10 million inhabited worlds. = History and future of the world = The book's extensive teachings about the history of the world include its physical development about 4.5 billion years ago, the gradual changes in conditions that allowed life to develop, and long ages of organic evolution that started with microscopic marine life and led to plant and animal life in the oceans, later on land. The emergence of humans is presented as having occurred about a million years ago from a branch of superior primates originating from a lemur ancestor. The first humans are said to have been male and female twins called Andon and Fonta, born \\"993,419 years prior to 1934.\\" The Urantia Book teaches not only biological evolution, but that human society and spiritual understandings evolve by slow progression, subject both to periods of rapid improvement and the possibility of retrogression. Progress is said to follow a divine plan that includes periodic gifts of revelation and ministry by heavenly teachers, which eventually will lead to an ideal world status of \\"light and life\\" in the far distant future. Although there is the ideal and divine plan of progression, it is said to be fostered and administered by various orders of celestial beings who are not always perfect. Urantia is said to be a markedly \\"confused and disordered\\" planet that is \\"greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment\\" compared to more typical inhabited worlds, due to an unusually severe history of rebellion and default by its spiritual supervisors.  Comparisons  = Comparison to Christianity = More than one third of the content of The Urantia Book is devoted to a narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus, and the Judeo- Christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other. The book's teachings claim to be a clarification and expansion of Christian belief. However, numerous differences are noted between its teachings and commonly accepted Christian doctrines. Jesus is held in high regard by The Urantia Book, as he is in the New Testament of the Bible. The following are attributed to him in both texts: * He was both human and divine, the Son of God incarnate who was born to Mary, whose husband was Joseph. * He performed many of the miracles described in the Bible, such as the resurrection of Lazarus, the turning of water into wine, the feeding of the five thousand, and numerous healings of the blind, diseased, and infirm. * He taught twelve apostles, most of whom went on to spread his teachings. * He was crucified, and on the third day after his death, rose from the dead. * He will return to the world again some day. Some differences with Christianity include: * Jesus' crucifixion is not considered an atonement for the sins of humanity. The crucifixion is taught to be an outcome of the fears of religious leaders of the day, who regarded his teachings as a threat to their positions of authority. * Jesus is considered the human incarnation of \\"Michael of Nebadon,\\" one of more than 700,000 \\"Paradise Sons\\" of God, or \\"Creator Sons.\\" Jesus is not considered the second person of the Trinity as he is in Christianity. The book refers to the Eternal Son as the second person of the Trinity. * Jesus was born on Earth through natural means of conception instead of a virgin birth. * Jesus did not walk on water or perform some of the miracles that are attributed to him in the Bible. = Comparison to Seventh-day Adventism = Gardner notes similarities between Seventh-day Adventism and the teachings of The Urantia Book, and sees this as evidence that William Sadler and Wilfred Kellogg had a role in editing or writing the book, since they both were one-time believers in Adventism. For instance, two basic Adventist beliefs that distinguish it from mainline Christianity are the doctrines of soul sleeping and annihilationism, both of which The Urantia Book also supports. Lewis notes that from the perspective of the book being a \\"revelation,\\" it could be claimed the \\"celestial beings\\" simply found areas of Adventist belief to be accurate and therefore presented and expanded on them. While the book supports aspects of Adventism, it also is mixed with teachings that are heresies to Adventists. = Other comparisons = The book can be seen as belonging in the genre of spiritual literature that includes A Course in Miracles and Conversations with God. Gardner compares it with Oahspe, noting that though Oahspe is \\"vastly inferior to the UB both in ideas and style of writing,\\" they are similar in claiming to have been written by celestial beings channelled through a human conduit, teaching that there is \\"one ultimate God who oversees a vast bureaucracy of lesser deities\\" while both outline an elaborate cosmology. The book's claimed supernatural origin has been compared to similar claims of the Book of Mormon, Science and Health, the Quran, and the Bible, with belief in it not being seen as necessarily a greater leap in reason. Comparisons with facets of various world religions are incorporated in the book, including Buddhism, Islam, Taoism, Judaism, Hinduism, Shinto, and Confucianism. For example, Paper 131, \\"The World's Religions\\" discusses the aspects of these religions that are in common with what the book claims is the \\"religion of Jesus.\\" The stance of the book is that there \\"is not a Urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith.\\"  Consideration as literature  The Urantia Book has been enjoyed by some as a form of science fiction, historical fiction or fantasy. The Urantia Book is noted for its high level of internal consistency and an advanced writing style. Skeptic Martin Gardner, in a book otherwise highly critical of The Urantia Book, writes that it is \\"highly imaginative\\" and that the \\"cosmology outrivals in fantasy the cosmology of any science-fiction work known to me.\\" Gooch says that for nonbelievers, the book is a mixture of being \\"fascinating, inspiring, compelling, haunting, entertaining, annoying, incomprehensible, and always wordy.\\" Parts I, II, and III are chiefly written in expository language. The papers are informational, matter-of-fact, and instructional. Part IV of the book is written as a biography of Jesus' life, and some feel it is a rich narrative with well- developed characters, high attention to detail, woven sub-plots, and realistic dialogue. Considered as literature, Part IV is favorably compared to retellings of Jesus' life, such as The Gospel According to Jesus Christ by Jos√© Saramago and Behold the Man by Michael Moorcock. Martin Gardner considers Part IV to be an especially \\"well-written, impressive work,\\" and says, \\"Either it is accurate in its history, coming directly from higher beings in position to know, or it is a work of fertile imagination by someone who knew the New Testament by heart and who was also steeped in knowledge of the times when Jesus lived.\\" His assessment is that the narrative is consistent with human authorship.  Critical views  = Criticisms of claims as a revelation = The authors refer to the book as the fifth revelation of \\"epochal significance\\" to humankind, the fourth epochal revelation having been the life of Jesus. The claim of revelation in The Urantia Book has been criticized for various reasons. Skeptics such as Martin Gardner say it is a product of human efforts. Because the book does not support certain tenets of Christianity, such as the atonement doctrine, while at the same time presenting an account of parts of Jesus' life absent in the Bible, others with a Christian viewpoint have argued it cannot be genuine. Gooch notes that while its \\"somewhat dated, elegant\\" prose could be read as fiction, due to its claim of divine inspiration \\"the book invites reactions far more scathing than [it] ... might otherwise merit.\\" = Criticism of its science = In Paper 101, \\"The Real Nature of Religion,\\" the authors write: > We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of > this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the > ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the > physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of > additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new > developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such > humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear > that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these > revelations is not inspired. As pointed out by the likes of Martin Gardner, the science in The Urantia Book reflects the views that prevailed at the time the book originated. The claim by the authors, that no unknown scientific discoveries could be imparted, can function as a ruse to allow mistakes to be dismissed later. The appeal to convenience that post-1955 scientific knowledge is not being presented is consistent with a book written by humans in the 1950s instead of celestial beings with superior knowledge. Examples of criticisms regarding the science in The Urantia Book include: * The described formation of the solar system is consistent with the Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis, which though popular in the early part of the 20th century, was discarded by the 1940s after major flaws were noted. The currently accepted scientific explanation for the origin of the solar system is based on the nebular hypothesis. * According to the book's descriptions, the universe is hundreds of billions of years old and periodically expands and contracts ‚Äî \\"respires\\" ‚Äî at 2-billion- year intervals. Recent observations measure the true age of the universe to be 13.8 billion years. The book does not support the Big Bang theory. * A fundamental particle called an \\"ultimaton\\" is proposed, with an electron being composed of 100 ultimatons. The particle is not known to be described anywhere else and the concept is at odds with modern particle physics. * The Andromeda Galaxy is claimed to be \\"almost one million\\" light years away, repeating a systematic mistake in the measurements of the distance to galaxies made in the 1920s. The galaxy is now known to be 2.5 million light years away. * The book repeats the mistaken idea that planets close to a sun will gradually spin slower until one hemisphere is left always turned to the sun due to tidal locking, citing Mercury as an example. Scientists at the time of the book's origin thought one side of Mercury always faced the sun, just as one side of the Moon always faces the Earth. In 1965, radio astronomers discovered however that Mercury rotates fast enough for all sides to see exposure to the sun. Scientists further established that Mercury is locked in this spin rate in a stable resonance of 3 spins for every 2 orbits, and it is not slowing and so will never have one side left always turned to the sun. * Some species are said to have evolved suddenly from single mutations without transitional species. The theory originated with Dutch botanist Hugo De Vries but was short-lived and is not now supported. * The book erroneously says that a solar eclipse was predicted in 1808 by the Native American prophet Tenskwatawa. The eclipse actually was predicted in late April 1806 and occurred on June 16, 1806. In 2009, Urantia Foundation acknowledged the error and revised the book. * Controversial statements about human races can be found in the book. Gardner recounts that William S. Sadler also wrote eugenicist works that contain similar arguments to some ideas presented in The Urantia Book. While some adherents of the book believe that all of the information in The Urantia Book including its science is literally true, others accept that the science is not fully accurate. For example, Meredith Sprunger, a liberal believer in The Urantia Book and retired minister of the United Church of Christ, wrote that research \\"has revealed that virtually all of the scientific material found in the UB was the accepted scientific knowledge of the period in which the book was written, was held by some scientists of that time, or was about to be discovered or recognized.\\" He further argued against its literal infallibility and said that fundamentalism over the book is \\"just as untenable as Biblical fundamentalism.\\" Other believers maintain that the book has prophetically anticipated scientific advances. They believe more of its science ‚Äî if not all of it ‚Äî will be proven correct in the future. Gardner evaluated many of these claims as of 1995 and argued that they were fairly unconvincing. Because the book is said to have been written by the revelators by 1935 while then was not being published until 1955, discoveries from science during the two intervening decades are often declared to be prophetic by believers, while skeptics point out that edits could have been made to the book up to its 1955 publication. For instance, the catalytic role that carbon plays in the sun's nuclear reactions is described in the book, and Hans Bethe's announcement of the discovery was made in 1938. The only apparent anticipation of science the book has made, in Gardner's opinion, is that it says the magnetic sense that homing pigeons possess is \\"not wholly wanting as a conscious possession by mankind.\\" In 1980, a British zoologist, Robin Baker, published evidence that humans have a limited magnetic sense. Mark McMenamin, a professor of geology, quotes a section of the book describing a billion-year-old supercontinent that subsequently split apart, forming ocean basins where early marine life developed. He says, \\"This amazing passage, written in the 1930s, anticipates scientific results that did not actually appear in the scientific literature until many decades later.\\" McMenamin also states, \\"Of course I am being selective here in my choice of quotations, and there are reams of scientifically untenable material in The Urantia Book.\\" = Use of other published material without attribution = The Urantia Book states in its Foreword that more than one thousand \\"human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings\\" were selected in preparing the papers. The authors say that they were required to \\"give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented\\" and would \\"resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind.\\" One of the authors wrote in Part IV: \\"I well know that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds.\\" In recent years, students of the papers have found that the free use of other sources appears to be true. None of the material allegedly used from other sources is directly cited or referenced within the book. In 1992, a reader of The Urantia Book, Matthew Block, self-published a paper that showed The Urantia Book utilized material from 15 other books. All of the source authors identified in Block's paper were published in English between 1905 and 1943 by U.S. publishers and are typically scholarly or academic works that contain concepts and wording similar to what is found in The Urantia Book. Block has since claimed to have discovered over 125 source texts that were incorporated into the papers. The use of outside source materials was studied separately by Gardner, and Gooch, and they concluded, consistent with their respective conclusion that the book's author(s) must have been human, that the book therefore plagiarized many of the sources noted by Block. For instance, Gardner and Block note that Paper 85 appears to have been taken from the first eight chapters of Origin and Evolution of Religion by Edward Washburn Hopkins, published by Yale University Press in 1923. Each section of the paper corresponds to a chapter in the book, with several passages possibly used as direct material and further material used in Papers 86-90 and 92. (In addition to the book's \\"heavy indebtedness to Hopkins,\\" Gardner discovered that Hopkins was a major reference in an earlier book authored by Sadler, adding to Gardner's view that it is more likely Sadler had a hand in writing or editing The Urantia Book than that celestial beings wrote it.) Likewise, much of The Urantia Book material relating to the evolution of mankind appears to have been directly taken from Henry Fairfield Osborn, Man Rises to Parnassus: Critical Epochs in the Prehistory of Man published by Princeton University Press in 1928. In one example cited by Block and confirmed by Gardner and Gooch, the original author discusses the periodicity of the chemical elements and concludes that the harmony in the construction of the atom suggests some unspecified plan of organization. The authors of The Urantia Book assert that this harmony is evidence of the intelligent design of the universe. W. F. G. Swann writes on page 64 of The Architecture of the Universe (italics indicate edits as compared to The Urantia Book, bolding indicates deletions): Contrast with The Urantia Book's version: Block and other believers do not see the use of the source materials as plagiarism, but express a view instead that the quality of the way the material was borrowed is consistent with authorship by celestial beings and that study of the sources leads to an even deeper understanding of The Urantia Book. Gooch, a professor of English, assessed that the use of the sources \\"does reveal to us an author with a busy genius for metaphysical invention and poetic turns of phrase whose scam was at worst benign and at most visionary.\\" Asked by Gardner what he thought of these plagiarisms, Sprunger responded in a letter by saying that if humans wrote the book the plagiarisms would indeed be disturbing but not if it was written by supermortals.  Influence  = Adherents = It is difficult to gauge how many adherents there may be as there are multiple organizations to census. Informal study groups \\"tend to sprout, ripen, then vanish or splinter\\" and have not been counted reliably. Readers sometimes join study groups after reading on their own for years or decades, others join them soon after developing an interest in the book, while \\"for most, worship remains as individual as the act of reading.\\" Disagreements over the legal ownership of the book, its interpretation, and the reception of new revelations have led to some splintering, though these disagreements appear to have been settled to the satisfaction of most adherents. The movement generally incorporates a nonsectarian view, contending that individuals with different religious backgrounds can receive the book's teachings as an enrichment rather than as a contradiction of their faiths. The movement inspired by The Urantia Book has not developed clergy or institutions such as churches, or temples. Sarah Lewis notes that, \\"The Urantia Revelation is not securing legitimacy through historically known and accepted means to any great degree, nor is it even using common language that would increase the likelihood of understanding and therefore acceptance. It introduces new concepts and a new language, and this does not make acceptance any easier.\\" She assesses that the movement is uncontroversial compared to other ones, \\"lacking the zealous proselytizing found within many other groups,\\" and that it is therefore likely to remain small and unaffected by opposing views. Urantia Foundation advocated a \\"slow growth\\" policy in the past and had not significantly marketed the book. Sales by Urantia Foundation went from 7,000 in 1990 to 24,700 in 1997, and steadily increased to nearly 38,000 in 2000, an \\"upturn that seems to represent a genuine trend rather than just some spike on a sales chart,\\" but in 2011 the Foundation reported worldwide annual sales of 16,000 copies and over 60,000 downloads from various sites. Since the book was determined to be in the public domain in 2001, other organizations, such as The Urantia Book Fellowship under the publishing name Uversa Press, have also published the book. Copies of The Urantia Book are on the Internet in various formats and it has been adapted to more recent platforms such as the Kindle and the iOS App Store. Several audio books of the text are also on the Internet. The International Urantia Association had twenty-six reader associations worldwide as of 2002, and the Urantia Book Fellowship (formerly the Urantia Brotherhood, founded in 1955 with Urantia Foundation as the original social fraternal organization of believers) claimed roughly twelve hundred official members, with the highest concentrations in the West of the United States and the Sun Belt, especially California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas. It appears an increasing number of people are forming study groups, participating in Internet discussion groups, and hosting or visiting websites about it. = Independent channelers = The Teaching Mission is a group of Urantia channellers. According to Richard Landes, \\"The foundation considers them self- deluded, but they have created a schism that continues to disrupt the movement.\\" Vern Grimsley was a \\"dynamic speaker\\" who founded a Urantian outreach organization called Family of God in the 1970s, which was initially supported by others in the movement, including the Urantia Foundation. Beginning in the early 1980s, Grimsley claimed he heard voices that were from the same higher beings who wrote The Urantia Book, and that the voices warned of an impending world war followed by a nuclear holocaust. While some in the movement believed him, others including the Urantia Foundation concluded Grimsley's messages were spurious, former friends eventually began to shun him, and in later years he is said to have lived in obscurity. Global Community Communications Alliance, founded by Gabriel of Urantia (born Anthony J. Delevin), and Ni√°nn Emerson Chase (born Nancy Emerson Chase), study the Urantia Book and The Cosmic Family volumes (which are the continuation of the Fifth Epochal Revelation). Along with a number of social outreach programs, they also operate Avalon Organic Gardens & EcoVillage. = In popular culture = * Karlheinz Stockhausen based his seven-opera cycle Licht on the cosmology of The Urantia Book. * Stevie Ray Vaughan (1954‚Äì1990), American blues-rock guitarist: \\"Stevie often brought along the book of Urantia and read Lindi passages from the strange publication.\\" * Jimi Hendrix (1942‚Äì1970) \\"Jimi also had with him the Book of Urantia, an alternative Bible... Jimi carried this book with him everywhere--along with his Bob Dylan songbook--and told friends he had learned much from its pages.\\" * Jaco Pastorius (1951‚Äì1987) wrote the song 'Havona' while he was still playing in the jazz fusion band Weather Report during the late 1970s (the song features on the album Heavy Weather) * Jerry Garcia was a reader of The Urantia Book and claimed it was \\"one of his favorite esoteric works\\" * Kerry Livgren is quoted: \\"In 1977, I discovered a book that convinced me I had reached the end of my quest. It was called The Urantia Book ....\\" * Pato Banton Reggae artist and toaster explained in several interviews how the discovery of The Urantia Book answered many questions he had sustained during a fifteen-year spiritual quest, and how he discovered his personal relationship with God through it.https://soundcloud.com/urantia-book-radio/pato-banton-how-i-found-the- urantia-book-produced-by-urantia-now  Symbols  Paradise Trinity An important symbol described in The Urantia Book as \\"the banner of Michael\\" and the \\"material emblem of the Trinity government of all creation,\\" consists of three azure blue concentric circles on a white background. The circles are said to be \\"emblematic of the infinity, eternity, and universality of the Paradise Trinity.\\" The incarnated priest and contemporary of Abraham, Machiventa Melchizedek, wore on his breast an emblem of three concentric circles representative of the Paradise Trinity. During a system-wide rebellion instigated by Lucifer, the so-called \\"war in heaven,\\" Lucifer's emblem was a banner of white with one red circle, in the center of which a black solid circle appeared. Urantia Foundation, the original publisher of The Urantia Book, holds a United States trademark on the concentric circles, and placed a depiction of the circles on the cover of The Urantia Book. The circles are also used to indicate other organizations affiliated with Urantia Foundation.

Y. Chu. The company was successively headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1954‚Äì1963), Tewksbury, Massachusetts (1963‚Äì1976), and finally in Lowell, Massachusetts (1976‚Äì1997). At its peak in the 1980s, Wang Laboratories had annual revenues of $3 billion and employed over 33,000 people. It was one of the leading companies during the time of the Massachusetts Miracle. The company was directed by An Wang, who was described as an \\"indispensable leader\\" and played a personal role in setting business and product strategy until his death in 1990. Under his direction, the company went through several distinct transitions between different product lines, beginning with typesetters, calculators and word processors, then adding computers, copiers and laser printers. Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1992. After emerging from bankruptcy, the company eventually changed its name to Wang Global. Wang Global was acquired by Getronics of The Netherlands in 1999, becoming Getronics North America, then was sold to KPN in 2007 and CompuCom in 2008, after which it no longer existed as a distinct brand or division. Public stock listing As Wang took steps to ensure that the Wang family would retain control of the company even after going public. He created a second class of stock, class B, with higher dividends, but only one-tenth the voting power of class C. The public mostly bought class B shares; the Wang family retained most of the class C shares. (The letters B and C were used to ensure that brokerages would fill any Wang stock orders with class B shares unless class C was specifically requested). Wang stock had been listed in the New York Stock Exchange, but this maneuver was not quite acceptable under NYSE's rules, and Wang was forced to delist with NYSE and relist on the more liberal American Stock Exchange. After Wang's 1992 bankruptcy, \\"Class B and C common stock .. treated the same.\\" Products =Typesetters= The company's first major project was the Linasec in 1964. It was an electronic special purpose computer, designed to justify papertape for use on automated Linotype machines. It was developed under contract to Compugraphic, who manufactured phototypesetters. Compugraphic retained the rights to manufacture the Linasec without royalty. They exercised these rights, effectively forcing Wang out of the market. =Calculators= The Wang LOCI-2 Logarithmic Computing Instrument desktop calculator (the earlier LOCI-1 in September 1964 was not a real product) was introduced in January 1965. Using factor combining it was probably the first desktop calculator capable of computing logarithms, quite an achievement for a machine without any integrated circuits. The electronics included 1,275 discrete transistors. It actually performed multiplication by adding logarithms, and roundoff in the display conversion was noticeable: 2 times 2 yielded 3.999999999. From 1965 to about 1971, Wang was a well-regarded calculator company. Wang calculators a used calculator for sale in 1977: cost in the mid-four-figures,US$3,000 to US$6,000 used Nixie tube readouts, performed transcendental functions, had varying degrees of programmability, and exploited magnetic core memory. The 200 and 300 calculator models were available as timeshared simultaneous (SE) packages that had a central processing unit (the size of a small suitcase) connected by cables leading to four individual desktop display/keyboard units. Competition included HP, which introduced the HP 9100A in 1968, and old-line calculator companies such as Monroe and Marchant. Wang calculators were at first sold to scientists and engineers, but the company later won a solid niche in financial-services industries, which had previously relied on complicated printed tables for mortgages and annuities. One perhaps apocryphal story tells of a banker who spot-checked a Wang calculator against a mortgage table and found a discrepancy. The calculator was right, the printed tables were wrong, and the company's reputation was made. In the early seventies, Wang believed that calculators would become unprofitable low-margin commodities, and decided to exit the calculator business. =Word processors= The Wang 1200 Wang's first attempt at a word processor was the Wang 1200, announced in late 1971, but not available until 1972. The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator hooked up to an OEM- manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for keying and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage. Harold Koplow, who had written the microcode for the Wang 700 (and its derivative, the Wang 500) rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching. The operator of a Wang 1200 typed text on a conventional IBM Selectric keyboard; when the Return key was pressed, the line of text was stored on a cassette tape. One cassette held roughly 20 pages of text, and could be \\"played back\\" (e.g., the text retrieved) by printing the contents on continuous-form paper in the 1200 typewriter's \\"print\\" mode. The stored text could also be edited, using keys on a simple, six-key array. Basic editing functions included Insert, Delete, Skip (character, line), and so on. The labor and cost savings of this device were immediate, and remarkable: pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors, and projects could be worked on, stored, and then retrieved for use later on. The rudimentary Wang 1200 machine was the precursor of the Wang Office Information System (OIS), which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the American workplace. Wang OIS Following the Wang 1200, Harold Koplow and David Moros made another attempt at designing a word processor. They started by first writing the user's manual for the product. A 2002 Boston Globe article refers to Koplow as a \\"wisecracking rebel\\" who \\"was waiting for dismissal when, in 1975, he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible.\\" In Koplow's words, \\"Dr. Wang kicked me out of marketing. I, along with Dave Moros was relegated to Long Range Planning ‚Äî 'LRPed'. This ... was tantamount to being fired: 'here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company.'\\" Although he and Moros perceived the assignment to design a word processing machine as busywork. They went ahead anyway, wrote the manual, and convinced An Wang to turn it into a real project. The word processing machinethe Wang 1200 WPSwas introduced in June 1976 and was an instant success, as was its successor, the 1977 Wang OIS (Office Information System). These products were technological breakthroughs. They were multi-user systems. Each workstation looked like a typical terminal, but contained its own Intel 8080 microprocessor (later versions used a Z80) and 64 KB of RAM (comparable, but lower in power than the original IBM PC which came out in 1981). Disk storage was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations, and connection was via high-speed dual coaxial cable \\"928 Link\\".During the late 1970s and early 1980s Wang Labs Dept. 14, headed by Harold Koplow, was responsible for development of the WANG WPS and OIS Systems, Wang's most successful products. The internal code name for the project was \\"928\\" derived from the date of original conception of the product September 28, 1975. Multiple OIS masters could be networked to each other, allowing file sharing among hundreds of users. The systems were user-friendly and fairly easy to administer, with the latter task often performed by office personnel, in an era when most machines required trained administrators. =Copiers/printers= Ahead of IBM and Xerox, the lead for \\"the 'intelligent' printer: a reasonably priced, high-speed office copier that can be linked electronically to ...\\" PCs \\"and other automated equipment\\" was captured by Wang. A year later The New York Times described the IBM 6670 Information Distributor as \\"closer to the standard envisioned.\\" =Early computer models= Wang 3300 Wang's first computer, the Wang 3300, is an 8-bit integrated circuit general purpose minicomputer specifically designed to be the central processor for a multi- terminal time-sharing system. Byte oriented it also provides a number of double byte operand memory commands. Core memory ranges from 4,096 to 65,536 bytes in 4,096 byte increments.3300 Computer Reference Manual Development began shortly after hiring Rick Bensene in June 1968. The product was announced in February 1969Wang Labs enters mini-computer market and shipped to its first customer on March 29, 1971.WANG DELIVERS FIRST MINI-COMPUTER Wang 2200 On its journey from calculators and word processing to serious data processing Wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer system, some of which were WordProcessing-based and some of which were DataProcessing-based. Instead of a clear, linear progression, the product lines overlapped and in some cases borrowed technology from each other. The most identifiable Wang minicomputer performing recognizable data processing was the Wang 2200 which appeared in May 1973. Unlike some other desktop computers such as the HP 9830, it had a CRT in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled Compact Cassette storage unit and keyboard. Microcoded to run interpretive BASIC, about 65,000 systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and medium-size businesses worldwide. The original 2200 was a single user system. The improved VP model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language (renamed Basic-2). The 2200 VP evolved into a desktop computer and larger MVP system to support up to 16 workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The disk subsystems could be attached to up to 15 computers giving a theoretical upper limit of 240 workstations in a single cluster. Unlike the other product lines such as the VS and OIS (both described below), Wang aggressively used value added resellers (VARs) to customize and market 2200 systems. One such creative solution deployed dozens of 2200 systems and was developed in conjunction with Hawaii- and Hong Kong-based firm, Algorithms, Inc. It provided paging (beeper) services for much of the Hong Kong market in the early 1980s. Overshadowed by the Wang VS, the 2200 languished as a cost-effective, but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it. In the late 1980s Wang revisited the 2200 series one last time, offering 2200 customers a new 2200 CS with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging 2200s. The 2200 CS was accompanied by an Intel 386 processor, updated disk units and other peripherals. Most 2200 customers upgraded to the 2200 CS, after which Wang never again developed or marketed any new 2200 products. In 1997, Wang reported having about two hundred 2200 systems still under maintenance around the world. Throughout, Wang had always offered maintenance services for the 2200. The 2200 Basic2 language was ported to be compiled and run on non-Wang hardware and operating systems by at least two companies. Niakwa Inc created a product named NPL (originally named Basic-2C). Kerridge Computer (now a part of ADP) created a product named KCML. Both products support DOS, Windows and various Unix systems. The Basic2 language has been substantially enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs. Compared to the 2200 Wang hardware the compiled solutions improve all factors (speed, disk space, memory, user limits) by tens to hundreds of times. So while Wang support for the 2200 is gone many software applications continue to function. During the 1970s about 2,000 Wang 2200T computers were shipped to the USSR. Due to the Afghan war in the 1980s, US and COCOM export restrictions ended the shipment of Wang computers. The Soviets were in great need of computers. In 1981 Russian engineers at Minpribor's Schetmash factory in Kursk reverse engineered the Wang 2200T and created a computer they named the Iskra 226. The \\"COCOM restrictions\\" theory, though, while popular in the West, is challenged by some Russian computer historians on the basis of the fact that development for the Iskra-226 started in 1978, two years before the Afghan war. One possible reason for this might be a Soviet fear of the backdoors in the Western hardware. It is also significantly different from the Wang 2200 in its internals, being more inspired by it, rather than a direct clone. It used the same Basic language (named T-Basic) with a few enhancements. Many research papers reference calculations done on the Iskra 226. The machine's designers were nominated for a 1985 State Prize. Later, a somewhat scaled-down Unix implementation was created for Iskra-226, which was widely used in the Soviet Union but is virtually unknown in the West. Wang OIS Wang had a line called Alliance, which was based on the high end OIS (140/145) hardware architecture. It had more powerful software compared to the OIS word processing and list processing packages. The system was Tempest certified, leading to global deployment in American embassies after the Iran hostage crisis.Broad, William J. \\"Computer 'whispers' worry Washington\\" The Globe and Mail. Toronto, Ont.:Apr 9, 1983. p. P.10 The Z80 platform on which Alliance ran forced it to remain as an 8-bit application in a 64 KB workstation. The Wang VS computer line The first Wang VS computer was introduced in 1977, the same year as Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX,\\"The VAX 11/780 was introduced on October 25, 1977 at the Digital Equipment Corporation's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. It was the first member of the VAX family.\\" ; both continued for decades.Wang's VS was desupported in 2014 The VS instruction set was compatible with the IBM 360 series, but it did not run any IBM 360 system software. =Software= The VS operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations. The VS was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general, and IBM in particular. While many programming languages were available, the VS was typically programmed in COBOL. Other languages supported in the VS integrated development environment included Assembler, COBOL 74, COBOL 85, BASIC, Ada, RPG II, C, PL/I, FORTRAN, Glossary, MABASIC, SPEED II and Procedure (a scripting language). Pascal was also supported for I/O co- processor development. The Wang PACE (Professional Application Creation Environment) 4GL and database was used from the mid-1980s onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens, hundreds of distinct application modules, and serving many hundreds of users. Substantial vertical applications were developed for the Wang VS by third party software houses throughout the 1980s in COBOL, PACE, BASIC, PL/I and RPG II. The Wang OFFICE family of applications and Wang WP were both popular applications on the VS. Word Processing ran on the VS through services that emulated the OIS environment and downloaded the WP software as \\"microcode\\" (in Wang terminology) to VS workstations. =Hardware= The press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by Wang, including the VS, as \\"minicomputers,\\"Berg, Eric N. (1985), \\"Fast Prime Computer to Make Debut,\\" The New York Times, January 22, 1985, d1: \\"The Prime model should also face stiff competition from other new high-speed minicomputers, such as the Data General Corporation's MV 10000, Wang Laboratories Inc.'s VS 300, and the International Business Machines Corporation's 4381 Model 3\\"Stein, Charles (1986): \\"A High-Tech David Faltered as Goliath,\\" The Boston Globe, November 27, 1989, Business section, p. 1: \\"the VS-300, a top of the line minicomputer Wang brought out in 1985...\\"Rosenberg, Robert (1992): \\"Company Fumbles Its Alliance with Giant IBM,\\" The Boston Globe, July 28, 1992, Business section, p. 37: \\"a steep decline in sales of its VS minicomputer and the recession generally, has pushed the Lowell computer maker to the brink\\" and Kenney's 1992 book refers to the VS line as \\"minicomputers\\" throughout.: index entry p. 320, pp. 97‚Äì9, and elsewhere Although some argue that the high-end VSes and their successors should qualify as mainframes, Wang avoided this term. In his autobiography, An Wang, rather than calling the VS 300 a mainframe, said that it \\"verges on mainframe performance\\"., p. 206 He went on to draw distinction between the \\"mainframes\\" at the high end of IBM's line (\\"just as Detroit would rather sell large cars ... so IBM would rather sell mainframes\\")‚Äîin which IBM had a virtual monopoly‚Äîwith the \\"mid-sized systems\\" in which IBM had not achieved dominance: \\"The minicomputer market is still healthy. This is good for the customer and good for minicomputer makers.\\", p. 213 * The VS7000 was introduced in 1987. These were a renumbering of the VS100, and VS300, with their more powerful counterpart upgrades identified as VS7110, VS7120 and VS7130 (for the VS100) and the VS7310 as the new high-end machine in this series. * Later models, the small VS5000 series, launched in approximately 1988, were user-installable, the smallest being physically similar in size to PCs of the era. * The largest iteration, the VS10000 supported an increasingly substantial number of users. The VS10000 was a technological departure from earlier models, in that it used 'Emitter Coupled Logic' (E.C.L.). ECL is a very fast current based logic that necessitated the use of very large 375 Amp 3 volt power supplies, massive heat-sinks and large squirrel cage blowers. It was stated that the VS1000 computer drew up to ten kilowatts of power.reference needed, possibly Star Manufacturing staff if they still exist For anyone who serviced these devices, the most comfortable place (also the noisiest) in the computer room was behind the computer. It also led to embarrassing situations where the horizontally mounted CPU and Memory boards often were allowed to contact the lower cage mount when withdrawn due to the significant weight of the board not being properly held on withdrawal. The VS1000 was designed to run multiple concurrent Operating Systems , and was piloted with the VS ver7 and a Unix Operating System, with strong rumors of a Novell research group attempting to rough a design for a large enterprise Novell OS. Going after IBM An Wang felt a personal sense of rivalry with IBM, partly as a result of heavy-handed treatment by IBM in 1955/56 over the rights to his magnetic-core patents. (This encounter formed the subject of a long chapter in Wang's own book, Lessons.) According to Charles C. Kenney, \\"Jack Connors remembers being in Wang's office one day when the Doctor pulled out a chart on which he had plotted Wang's growth and projected that Wang Laboratories would overtake IBM sometime in the middle of the 1990s. 'He had kept it a long time,' says Connors. 'And he believed it.'\\" Wang was one of the first computer companies to advertise on television, and the first to run an ad during the Super Bowl in 1978. Their first ad literally cast Wang Laboratories as David and IBM as Goliath, several years before the famous 1984 Apple Computer ad. A later ad depicted Wang Laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at IBM. Wang wanted to compete against IBM as a computer company, selling directly to management information system departments. Before the VS, however, Wang Laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company. The calculators, word processing systems and OIS were sold into individual departments, bypassing the corporate data-processing decision-makers. The chapter in Wang's book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as \\"a beachhead in the Fortune 1000.\\" The Wang VS was Wang's entry into IT departments. In his book, An Wang notes that, to sell the VS, \\"we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing ... who had experience dealing with MIS executives, and who knew their way around Fortune 1000 companies.\\" As the VS took hold, the word processor and OIS lines were phased out. The word processing software continued, in the form of a loadable-microcode environment that allowed VS workstations to take on the behavior of traditional Wang WP terminals to operate with the VS and use it as a document server. Wang made inroads into IBM and DEC markets in the 1980s, but did not have a serious impact on IBM's mainframe market due to self-limiting factors. Even though An Wang wanted to compete with IBM, too many Wang salespeople were incompletely trained on the significant DP capabilities of the VS. In many instances the VS ran smaller enterprises up to about $500 million/year and in larger organizations found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes, handling workstation pass-through and massive print services. At Exxon Corporation, for instance, thirteen 1985 top-of-the-line VS300s at the Houston headquarters were used in the 1980s and into the 1990s to receive mainframe reports and make them viewable online by executives. At Mellon Mortgage 18 VS systems from the smallest to the largest were used as the enterprise mortgage origination, servicing, finance, documentation and hedge system and also for mainframe gateway services for logon and printing. Between Mellon Mortgage and parent Mellon Bank, their network contained 45 VS systems and the Bank portion of the network supported about 16,000 Wang Office users for email, report distribution and scheduling. At Kent and KTec Electronics, two related Houston companies, separate VS clusters were the enterprise systems, handling distribution, manufacturing and accounting, with significant EDI capability for receiving customer forecasts, sending invoices, and sending purchase orders and receiving shipping notifications. Both systems ran the GEISCO EDI package. Kent, which grew to $600 million/year, ran the Arcus distribution software in COBOL and KTec, which grew to $250 million/year, ran the CAELUS MRP system for manufacturing in BASIC. =Aggressive marketing= In the late 1980s, a British television documentary accused the company of targeting a competitor, Canadian company AES Wordplex, in an attempt to take it out of the market. However, the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this. Wang's approach was internally called \\"The Gas Cooker Program\\", named after similar programs to give discounts on new gas stoves by trading in an old one. Wang was accused of targeting Wordplex by offering a large discount on Wang OIS systems with a trade-in of Wordplex machines, regardless of the age or condition of the trade-in machine. Based on its good reputation with users and its program of aggressive discounts, Wang gained an increasing share of a shrinking market. Wordplex was subsequently taken over by Norsk Data. =Word processing market collapse= The market for standalone word processing systems collapsed with the introduction of the personal computer. MultiMate, on the IBM PC and MS-DOS PC clones, replicated the keyboard and screen interface and functions of the Wang word processor, and was actively marketed to Wang corporate users, while several other WYSIWYG word processing programs also became popular. Wang did make one last play in this arena, producing a dedicated Intel-based word processor called the Wang Office Assistant in 1984. This was marketed and sold very successfully in the UK to a specific few Office Equipment Dealers who were able to up-grade their clients from Electronic Typwriters to the Office Assistant. They proved to be very reliable and fast when connected to the Wang bi-directional printer providing fairly cheap but very fast word processing to small companies such as Solictors. The USA were suprised at the success of this machine in the UK but could not supply a spell check programme in time before the PC, with its flexibility of combining word processors with other programs such as spreadsheets, had rendered such a specific task machine largely unsellable. And so the Wang Office Assistant had a short life span of only four years. The Digital Voice Exchange The Wang DVX was one of the first integrated switchboard and voicemail systems. In the United Kingdom it was selected for the DTI Office Automation Pilot schemes at the National Coal Board in about 1980. Wang, which had added DVX Message Waiting in 1984, named their 1989 announcement DVX II. Internal research on speech recognition was carried out and implemented for discrete word recognition but was never released to the field. At one point there were 50 members of the Voice Engineering Department. Lawrence E. Bergeron was instrumental in managing the Voice Engineering Department at Wang Labs. He promoted the purchase of a VAX-11/780 for 'real-time' signal processing research and created the Peripheral Signal Processor board (PSP). The PSP was placed into 16 racks to handle 128 phone lines for the DVX (Digital Voice Exchange). Wang's Digital Voice Exchange supported the renting of voice mailboxes. Voice prompts were created by a hired voice specialist to give a melodic presentation for the DVX. To avoid false triggering of touch- tones by the prompts (due to input/output cross talk), notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts. Some of the prompt languages supported were: German, Spanish, French, British English, American English, and Portuguese. PCs and PC-based products Despite the release of the 2200 PCS (Personal Computer System) and 2200 PCS-II models as early as 1976, the history of computing regards the earliest PC as one which contained a microprocessor, which the 2200 PCS did not. However, the self- contained PCS-II incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in PCs, including the first 5.25-inch floppy drives that were especially designed for the PCS-II by Shugart Associates. \\"The PCS II makes use of minidiskette storage devices initially conceived by Wang and developed by an independent disk manufacturer, Shugart Associates.\\" =The original Wang PC= An Wang had initially refused to develop an IBM-compatible PC, due to his personal dislike of IBM, even though his son Fred had pitched the idea. The original Wang PC was released April 1982 to counter the IBM PC which had been released the previous August and which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which Wang traditionally positioned the OIS system. It was based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor, a slightly faster CPU than the IBM PC's 8088.The Intel 8088 processor is a slightly modified version of the earlier 8086. Its external data bus is 8 bits wide as compared to the 8086's 16, thus requiring two bus cycles to transfer a 16-bit value. This resulted in slower execution time for some instructions. A hardware/software package that permitted the Wang PC to act as a terminal to the OIS and VS products was available. The hardware component, the first version was made of two large add-in boards called the WLOC (Wang Local Office Connection), contained a Z-80 processor and 64 KB of memory. Correction; The original PC-VS hardware was using the 928 terminal emulator board, the WLOC ¬© boards were used in the subsequent 80286 machines. These PC's later formed the basis for the system console on VS7000 and later series of the Wang mid frame series, being used for the initialisation of the boot process. One of the distinguishing features of the Wang PC was the system software. Similar to the Wang VS minicomputer, the command line was not immediately evident. Everything could be run from menus, including formatting a disk. Furthermore, each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a dedicated Help key on the keyboard. This software was later sold in MS-DOS compatible form for non Wang hardware. The Wang word processing software was also very graphical. The keyboard had 16 function-keys and, unlike WordStar, the popular word processor of the day, control key combinations were not required to navigate the system. The f-keys had the word processing functions labeled on them.This may be where the designers of WordPerfect got the idea of stickers with alt/ctrl/shift colors for the f-keys. However, the biggest stumbling block was thatdespite being a fully compliant MS-DOS systemit was not compatible with the IBM PC at the hardware level. This was a problem because MS-DOS was rarely used as anything more than a simple program loader; complex software (spreadsheets, Flight Simulator, etc.) could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM, arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC display adapter, that were not compatible with their counterparts in the IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written specifically for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. A basic word processing package developed by Wang and Microsoft's Multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products. Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase II were also available. This dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original Wang PC, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286 based product that was fully plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost. Most Wang PCs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently, unlike IBM-compatible PCs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics. A color graphics adapter and Wang-branded color monitor were also available. An ergonomic feature of the Wang PC was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box. By using these, there was nothing on the desktop except the keyboard. =IBM- compatible Wang PCs= After it became clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of PC compatibility, Wang belatedly released an emulation board for Wang PC that enabled operation of many PC-compatible software packages. The board accomplished this by monitoring all I/O and memory transactions (visible in those days before North/South bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus) and generating a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device, requiring emulation. For example: the floppy controller circuitry on the Wang PC was similar to that of the IBM PC but involved enough design differences that PC-compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail. Wang's PC emulation hardware would detect I/O and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the IBM PC and generate an NMI. The NMI handler would immediately be activated (the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to ROM routines on the emulation board instead of the NMI routine in the PC BIOS) and would then update an internal representation of the IBM PC floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state. Reads were satisfied in a similar way, by forcing an NMI, decoding the machine code indicated by the Instruction Pointer at the time of the fault, and then obtaining the desired info and updating the CPU registers accordingly before resuming the executing program. The PC emulation board thus enabled execution of an impressive number of applications by presenting \\"virtualized\\" PC- compatible hardware devices to them: a monochrome text-only video controller, a floppy controller, UARTs, DMA controller, parallel port, keyboard controller, etc. IBM-PC Emulation on the 8086-based Wang PC was working fairly reliably when IBM released their 80286-based PC-AT. Wang's answer was the 80286-based Wang APC (Advanced Professional Computer) which not only perpetuated the PC incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful PC emulation strategy: the 8086 decoded and executed instructions on-the-fly and was therefore able to respond to NMI on every instruction boundary, but the 80286 decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each CPU-mask stepping but which always prevented timely NMI execution. Wang's engineers came up with (and later patented) a rather devious instruction-prefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty. Further iterations of the PC line were released commencing with the model number PC-240. These later models booted directly into MS-DOS (or another compatible operating system) and supported ISA-standard expansion cards. This PC-240 still wasn't entirely IBM PC-standard as the keyboard, although being a standard PC/AT device, allowed for VS compatibility with 24 function keys rather than the normal 12, and a number of Wang VS-specific keys. There was also a slight difference in CPU interrupts from IBM standard, so some software had compatibility issues. VS connectivity was via an ISA- based VS-terminal card, or via LightSpeed, the networked VS Terminal Emulator, over an IPX-based Ethernet connection. Originally the PC-240 came with a Wang- specific Hercules Graphics Card and compatible screen, which also acted as a keyboard extension, meaning the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen. This was later replaced with an EGA card and screen. Around 1991, Wang released the PC350-16 and PC350-40, which were Intel 80386-based, clocked at 16 MHz and 40 MHz, respectively. They used the same VS-compatible keyboard as the PC-240. They had a maximum of 4 megabytes of RAM and came with VGA screens as standard. They were generally supplied with MS-DOS and Windows 3.0. The 350-16 had an interesting bug where, occasionally, the machine would freeze entirely and not boot up if power-cycled at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS wouldn't start. The solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU. In 1992, Wang marketed a PC-compatible based on the Intel 80386SX processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25 MHz and had a socket for an 80387 math coprocessor. It came with 2 megabytes of installed RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using SIMM memory cards. It had a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, an internal 80 megabyte hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five expansion slots were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems. In 1994, Wang released the slimline Alliance 750CD 80486 based PC in the United Kingdom. These machines used standard PC/AT keyboards and were entirely IBM compatible, shipping with MSDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.11 as standard. The only unusual feature was that system BIOS settings and the real-time clock were maintained by four standard AA batteries as opposed to a more typical solutionsuch as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery. While originally offered with a 33 MHz 80486DX, the 750CD could be upgraded to later Socket 3 processors such as the 80486DX2 through the use of third party CPU upgrade adapters or interposers. This allowed upgrading to speeds beyond 50 MHz without overclocking, or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of 100 MHz with overclocking, dependent on the processor used. =Wang Freestyle= Wang Freestyle was a 1988 product consisting of: * A touch-sensitive tablet and special stylus for written annotation of any file that could be displayed on the PC. * A phone handset for voice annotation, but not voice communication. Demonstrated strongly in conjunction with the tablet for explaining the text annotations. * Email, via Wang OFFICE, of the resulting document set. Although the low end product was priced at $2,000 this precluded the important features such as \\"facsimile and voice options\\" (priced at $12,000). Freestyle was not a success in anything except marketing terms. A description of the system at the University of Southern California (USC) shows the symptoms of the failure: > The $1.2 million USC system includes a VS 7150 mid-range computer; 30 image > workstations, 25 with Freestyle capabilities; a laser printer; five > endorsers; and five document scanners.

The system was so costly, even in the context of a Wang Integrated Imaging System, that Freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff. Apart from USC, unusual in that it was deployed at clerical level, it was sold as a C-LevelC- Level refers to \\"Chief level\\" officers in an organization tool for C grades to communicate with other C Grades.

Wang Labs would be only one of a large number of New England- based computer companies that would falter in the late 1980s and 1990s, marking the end of the Massachusetts Miracle. For instance the struggling Digital Equipment Corporation also significantly downsized in the 1990s and was acquired by Compaq. A common view within the PC community is that Wang Labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee (and was unable to compete against) general- purpose personal computers with word processing software in the 1980s. Word processing was not actually the mainstay of Wang's business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity. Although Wang manufactured desktops, its main business by the 1980s, was its VS line of mini-computer and \\"midframe\\" systems. The market for these mini-computers was ultimately conquered by enhanced micro-computers like the Apple Macintosh and the \\"Wintel\\" PC on one end and Sun, IBM and Hewlett-Packard servers on the other end. An Wang's insistence that his son, Fred Wang, succeed him contributed to the company's failure. Fred Wang was a business school graduate, \\"but by almost any definition\\", wrote Charles C. Kenney, \\"unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him\\". His assignment, first as head of research and development, then as president of the company, led to resignations by key R&D; and business personnel. Amid declining revenues, John F. Cunningham, an 18-year employee of the firm, resigned as President and COO of Wang Labs to become chairman and chief executive of Computer Consoles Inc. Cunningham resigned due to disagreement with An Wang on how to pull the company out of the slump, as well as being upset that Fred Wang was positioned as the successor, an instance of nepotism. One turning point occurred when Fred Wang was head of R&D.; On October 4, 1983, Wang Laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products, and promised dates of delivery. The announcement was well received, but even at the time there were warning signs. According to Datamation, Wang announced \\"everything but the kitchen sink. And if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too.\\"Stein, Charles (1986): \\"A High-Tech David Faltered as Goliath,\\" The Boston Globe, November 27, 1989, Business section, p. 1: \\"if you could attach the kitchen sink, they would announce that too ...\\" Very few of the products were close to completion and many of them had not even been started. All were delivered late and some were never delivered at all. In retrospect this was referred to as the \\"vaporware announcement\\" and it hurt the credibility of Fred Wang and Wang Laboratories. In 1986, Fred Wang, then 36 years old, was installed as president of Wang Laboratories. However, the company's fortunes continued to decline. Unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock, An Wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company. By August 1989, that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors. On August 4, 1989, An Wang fired his son. Richard W. Miller replaced him as the president of Wang Laboratories, having been with the company since 1988. Miller announced in December 1989 that the company would start to embrace established software standards, rather than use traditional proprietary designs. An Wang died in March 1990, and Miller took on the additional posts of Chairman and CEO. The company underwent massive restructuring, and in August 1990, it eliminated its bank debt, but still ended the year with a record net loss. In November 1990, Wang announced their first personal computers running Unix. Previously, Wang's presence in the UNIX and open systems markets had been modest. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington MA-based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, partially because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VSInteractive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran \\"native\\" on the VS hardware soon thereafterbut performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never a good fit for the inherently batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that \\"tty\\" style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its data dictionary, excellent referential integrity, and speedy application development, was in the process of being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client server RDBMS model, built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang's original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were simply abandoned. Ira Magaziner, who was brought in by Miller in 1990, proposed to take Wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether, and to go big into imaging software instead. In March 1991, the company introduced its Office 2000 marketing strategy, focusing on office productivity. In June 1991, Wang started reselling IBM computers, in exchange for IBM investing in Wang stock. Wang hardware strategy to re-sell IBM RS/6000s also included further pursuit of UNIX software. In August 1991, Wang won a suit against NEC and Toshiba claiming violation of Wang's patents on single in-line memory modules (SIMMs). The company still recorded a net loss for the 1991 fiscal year. Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on August 18, 1992, at a time when the company's attempted concession from proprietary to open systems was deemed by some analysts as \\"too little and too late.\\" Final years Wang Labs emerged from bankruptcy on September 20, 1993. As part of its bankruptcy reorganization, the company's iconic headquarters, Wang Towers in Lowell, was sold at auction. The complex, which originally cost $60 million to build and housed 4,500 workers in over a million square feet (100,000 m2) of office space, was sold in 1994, for $525,000. The renovated complex, which is now known as Cross Point, was subsequently sold in 1998, to a joint venture of Yale Properties and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors for a price reported to be over $100 million. The company emerged from bankruptcy with $200 million in hand and embarked on a course of acquisition and self-reinvention, eschewing its former role as an innovative designer and manufacturer of computer and related systems. Later in the 1990s, and under the guidance of then CEO Joe Tucci, with the acquisition of the Olsy division of Olivetti the company changed its name to Wang Global. By then Wang had settled on \\"network services\\" as its chosen business. The most advanced VS system, capable of supporting over 1,000 usersthe VS18000 Model 950was released in 1999, and smaller models based on the same CPU chip were released in 2000the VS6760 and the VS6780. These were the last VS-based hardware systems.VINTAGE COMPUTER: WANG LABORATORIES - horniger http://www.horniger.de/computer/wang/index.html#links Kodak acquired the Wang Software arm in 1997, strengthening its position in the then booming document imaging and workflow market. In 1999, Wang Global, by then back up to $3.5 billion in annual revenues, was acquired by Getronics of The Netherlands, a $1.5 billion network services company active only in parts of Europe and Australia. Joe Tucci departed Wang after the acquisition. Wang Labs then became Getronics North America. In 2005, Getronics announced New VS (VSGX), a product designed to seamlessly run the VS operating system and all VS software on Intel 80x86 and IBM POWER machines under Linux or Unix, using a hardware abstraction layer. The product was a joint commercial effort of Getronics and TransVirtual Systems, developer of the Wang VS virtualization technology that makes the New VS possible. VS software can be run under New VS without program or data conversion. The New VS is a combination of very specifically configured mainstream PC or PowerPC server hardware running virtualization software. It is interoperable with SCSI-based Wang VS tape and disk drives, which provide a means of restoring VS files from standard backup tapes or copying VS disk drives. Wang networking and clustering are supported over TCP/IP. In 2007, Getronics operations worldwide were divided and sold to companies in respective local geographies. Dutch telecommunications operator KPN acquired Getronics in North America and some parts of Europe. In July 2008, Getronics North America (now an arm of KPN) announced the ending of support for the legacy VS line as existing contracts expired, and that TransVirtual Systems would be exclusive reseller of the New VS platform. Shortly after, in August 2008, KPN sold Getronics North America to CompuCom of Dallas, Texas. The Wang VS product line, not actively marketed since the 1993 bankruptcy and a tiny portion of the Getronics business, survived in use into the 21st century; by 2006 about 1,000 to 2,000 systems remained in service worldwide. In 2014, CompuCom announced that all support for legacy VS systems would cease at the end of 2014, while support for New VS systems would continue through TransVirtual Systems.

Following the kidnap and murder of their eldest child, they lived in Europe, where Charles was impressed by Germany‚Äôs new air power. When they returned to America, he led the isolationist America First Committee. Anne‚Äôs supporting booklet The Wave of the Future declared that fascism was the inevitable way forward; she had also written a letter praising Hitler in unequivocal terms. After the war, she moved away from politics, writing extensive poetry and nonfiction, Gift from the Sea being an inspirational book for women that appears to foreshadow the green movement.

Kidnapping On March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs' first child, 20-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., was kidnapped from their home, Highfields, in East Amwell, New Jersey, outside Hopewell. Arriving at the Lindbergh home police began the first search into the disappearance of young Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., there police witnessed two clear sets of footprints outside of the Lindbergh home. One set specifically led southeast towards a ladder that was believed to be used in the abduction. Upon the discovery of intruders, police returned inside the home to begin their initial search of the nursery. Before calling the police Charles Lindbergh uncovered a plain white envelope located on the windowsill. Believing it was a ransom note, Charles left it for police inspection. Expert in crime-scene photography and fingerprints, Corporal Frank Kelly, was a part of the group that was investigating the disappearance of Charles Augustus Lindbergh. After processing the envelope for any evidence revealed a smudged fingerprint which would later be sent to the state official in charge, Major Schoeffel. Inside the envelope was a detailed ransom note from the kidnapper giving the Lindberghs guided instructions for the return of their child. After a massive investigation, a baby's body presumed to be that of Charles Lindbergh Jr. was discovered on May 12, 1932, some 4 miles (6.5 km) from the Lindbergh home, at the summit of a hill on the Hopewell‚ÄìMt.

Her work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1938, the U.S. Air Attach√© in Berlin invited Charles to inspect the rising power of Nazi Germany's Air Force. Impressed by German technology and the apparently-large number of aircraft at Nazi Germany's disposal and influenced by the staggering number of deaths from World War I, Charles opposed U.S. entry into the impending European conflict. He suggested that any military assistance to Britain might be provided for improper financial reasons: \\"To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war.\\"October 13, 1939, speech excerpted in CharlesLindbergh.com Lindbergh elucidated his beliefs about race in a Reader's Digest article in 1939, stating: \\"We can have peace and security only so long as we band together to preserve that most priceless possession, our inheritance of European blood, only so long as we guard ourselves against attack by foreign armies and dilution by foreign races.\\"Lindbergh, Charles. \\"Aviation, Geography, and Race.\\" Racial Nationalist Library.

However, his second Pulitzer Prize was for a cartoon published in 1958, and possibly his best- known cartoon was after the Kennedy assassination. Early life Mauldin was born in Mountain Park, New Mexico into a family with a tradition of military service. His father served as an artilleryman in World War I, and his grandfather had been a civilian scout in the Apache Wars. After growing up with his older brother, Sidney, there and in Phoenix, Arizona, Mauldin took courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts under the tutoring of Ruth VanSickle Ford. While in Chicago, Mauldin met Will Lang Jr. and became fast friends with him. Lang Jr. later became a journalist and a bureau head for Life magazine. World War II \\"Me future is settled, Willie. I'm gonna be a perfessor on types o' European soil.\\" First published in Stars and Stripes. Mediterranean edition, 10/25/1944 Shortly after returning to Phoenix in 1940, Mauldin enlisted in the Arizona National Guard. His division, the 45th Infantry Division, was federalized just two days later. While in the 45th, Mauldin volunteered to work for the unit's newspaper, drawing cartoons about regular soldiers or \\"dogfaces\\". Eventually he created two cartoon infantrymen, Willie and Joe, who represented the average American GI. During July 1943, Mauldin's cartoon work continued when, as a sergeant of the 45th Infantry Division's press corps, he landed with the division in the invasion of Sicily and later in the Italian campaign.DePastino, Willie & Joe. 2008. Mauldin began working for Stars and Stripes, the American soldiers' newspaper; as well as the 45th Division News, until he was officially transferred to the Stars and Stripes in February 1944. Egbert White, editor of the Stars and Stripes, encouraged Mauldin to syndicate his cartoons and helped him find an agent. page 127-128 By March 1944, he was given his own jeep, in which he roamed the front, collecting material. He published six cartoons a week.Michaelis, David. ‚ÄòHe Drew Great Mud‚Äô . The New York Times Sunday Book Review. March 2, 2008 His cartoons were viewed by soldiers throughout Europe during World War II, and were also published in the United States. The War Office supported their syndication,Bill Mauldin, edited by Todd DePastino, 2008. Willie & Joe: The War Years p. 13 not only because they helped publicize the ground forces but also to show the grim side of war, which helped show that victory would not be easy.Mauldin and DePastino 2008. p. 15 While in Europe, Mauldin befriended a fellow soldier-cartoonist, Gregor Duncan, and was assigned to escort him for a time. (Duncan was killed at Anzio in May 1944.) Mauldin was not without his detractors. His images‚Äîwhich often parodied the Army's spit-shine and obedience-to-orders-without-question policy‚Äîoffended some officers. After a Mauldin cartoon ridiculed Third Army commander General George Patton's decree that all soldiers be clean-shaven at all times‚Äîeven in combat‚ÄîPatton called Mauldin an \\"unpatriotic anarchist\\" and threatened to \\"throw [his] ass in jail\\" and ban Stars and Stripes from his command. General Dwight Eisenhower, Patton's superior, told Patton to leave Mauldin alone; he felt the cartoons gave the soldiers an outlet for their frustrations. \\"Stars and Stripes is the soldiers' paper,\\" he told him, \\"and we won't interfere.\\"Mauldin, B. Up Front. WW Norton (2000), pp. vi‚Äìvii. . In a 1989 interview, Mauldin said, \\"I always admired Patton. Oh, sure, the stupid bastard was crazy. He was insane. He thought he was living in the Dark Ages. Soldiers were peasants to him. I didn't like that attitude, but I certainly respected his theories and the techniques he used to get his men out of their foxholes.Lamb, D. \\"Bill, Willie, and Joe\\". MHQ ‚Äì The Quarterly Journal of Military History, vol. 1, issue 4 (summer, 1989), pp. 36‚Äì47. Mauldin's cartoons made him a hero to the common soldier. GIs often credited him with helping them to get through the rigors of the war. His credibility with the common soldier increased in September 1943, when he was wounded in the shoulder by a German mortar while visiting a machine gun crew near Monte Cassino. By the end of the war he received the Legion of Merit for his cartoons. Mauldin wanted Willie and Joe to be killed on the last day of combat, but Stars and Stripes dissuaded him. Postwar activities Mauldin in 1945 In 1945, at the age of 23, Mauldin won a Pulitzer Prize for his wartime body of work, exemplified by a cartoon depicting exhausted infantrymen slogging through the rain, its caption mocking a typical late-war headline: \\"Fresh, spirited American troops, flushed with victory, are bringing in thousands of hungry, ragged, battle-weary prisoners\\".\\"Editorial Cartooning\\" . The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-11-01. The first civilian compilation of his work, Up Front, a collection of his cartoons interwoven with his observations of war, topped the best-seller list in 1945. After war's end, the character of Willie was featured on the cover of Time Magazine for the June 18, 1945 issue. Mauldin made the cover of the July 21, 1961 issue. After the war, Mauldin turned to drawing political cartoons expressing a generally civil libertarian view associated with groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. These were not well received by newspaper editors, who were hoping for apolitical cartoons. Mauldin's attempt to carry Willie and Joe into civilian life was also unsuccessful, as documented in his memoir Back Home in 1947. In 1951, he appeared with Audie Murphy in the John Huston film The Red Badge of Courage, and in Fred Zinnemann's Teresa.Bill Mauldin, Cartoonist Who Showed World War II Through G.I. Eyes, Dies at 81, New York Times (January 23, 2003), retrieved September 27, 2016. In 1956, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States Congress as a Democrat in New York's 28th congressional district. Mauldin said about his run for Congress: > I jumped in with both feet and campaigned for seven or eight months. I found > myself stumping around up in these rural districts and my own background did > hurt there. A farmer knows a farmer when he sees one. So when I was talking > about their problems I was a very sincere candidate, but when they would ask > me questions that had to do with foreign policy or national policy, > obviously I was pretty far to the left of the mainstream up there. Again, > I'm an old Truman Democrat, I'm not that far left, but by their lives I was > pretty far left.\\"A Turn in Career, 1950‚Äì1958\\" . Bill Mauldin: Beyond Willie > And Joe, An online tribute drawn from the collections of the Library of > Congress (Library of Congress ‚Äì Swann Foundation), 2003 Mauldin's famous cartoon following the Kennedy assassination In 1959, Mauldin won a second Pulitzer Prize, while working at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for a cartoon depicting Soviet author Boris Pasternak in a Gulag, asking another prisoner, \\"I won the Nobel Prize for literature. What was your crime?\\" Pasternak had won the Nobel Prize for his novel Doctor Zhivago, but was not allowed to travel to Sweden to accept it. The following year Mauldin won the National Cartoonist Society Award for Editorial Cartooning. In 1961, he received their Reuben Award as well. In addition to cartooning, Mauldin worked as a freelance writer. He also illustrated many articles for Life magazine, The Saturday Evening Post, Sports Illustrated, and other publications. He brought back Joe as a war correspondent, writing letters to the stateside Willie. He made cartoons of Willie and Joe together only in tributes to the \\"soldiers' generals\\": Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall, after their deaths; for a Life article on the \\"New Army\\"; and as a salute to the late cartoonist Milton Caniff. In 1962, Mauldin moved to the Chicago Sun-Times. One of his most famous post-war cartoons was published in 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It depicted the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial, with his head in his hands. In 1969, Mauldin was commissioned by the National Safety Council to illustrate its annual booklet on traffic safety. These pamphlets were regularly issued without copyright, but for this issue the Council noted that Mauldin's cartoons were under copyright, although the rest of the pamphlet was not. In 1985, Mauldin won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. Mauldin remained with the Sun-Times until his retirement in 1991. He was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame on May 19, 1991. On September 19, 2001, Sergeant Major of the Army Jack L. Tilley presented Mauldin with a personal letter from Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki, and a hardbound book with notes from other senior Army leaders and several celebrities, including TV broadcasters Walter Cronkite and Tom Brokaw, and actor Tom Hanks. Tilley also promoted Mauldin to the honorary rank of first sergeant.Elder, p. 12 Mauldin's 1958 cartoon for which he received his second Pulitzer Prize Mauldin drew Willie and Joe for publication one last time on Veterans Day in 1998 for a Peanuts comic strip, in collaboration with its creator Charles M. Schulz, also a World War II veteran. Schulz signed the strip \\"Schulz, and my hero...\\" with Mauldin's signature underneath. Death and legacy Mauldin died on January 22, 2003, from complications of Alzheimer's disease and a bathtub scalding. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on January 29, 2003. Married three times, he was survived by seven children. (His daughter Kaja had died of non- Hodgkin lymphoma in 2001.) On March 31, 2010, the United States Post Office released a first-class denomination ($0.44) postage stamp in Mauldin's honor depicting him with Willie & Joe.USPS News Release: 2010 Stamp Program Unveiled ‚Äì Bill Mauldin (archived link, June 6, 2011) In 2005, Mauldin was inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma by Michael Vance.

A collection of post-war cartoons, Willie & Joe: Back Home, was published by Fantagraphics in August, 2011 (). Peanuts From 1969 to 1998, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz (himself a veteran of World War II) regularly paid tribute to Bill Mauldin in his Peanuts comic strip on Veterans Day. In the strips, Snoopy, dressed as an army vet, would annually go to Mauldin's house to \\"quaff a few root beers and tell war stories.\\" By the end of the strip Schulz had depicted 17 of Snoopy's visits. Schulz also paid tribute to Rosie the Riveter in 1976, and Ernie Pyle in 1997 and 1999. Filmography The films Up Front (1951) and Back at the Front (1952) were based on Mauldin's Willie and Joe characters; however, when Mauldin's suggestions were ignored in favor of making a slapstick comedy, he returned his advising fee; he said he had never seen the result. Mauldin also appeared as an actor in the 1951 films The Red Badge of Courage and Teresa, and as himself in the 1998 documentary America in the '40s. He also appeared in on-screen interviews in the Thames documentary The World at War. Footnotes References * DePastino, Todd. Bill Mauldin: A Life Up Front. New York: W.W.

Mephistopheles (, ; also Mephistophilus, Mephostopheles, Mephistophilis, Mephisto, Mephastophilis, and other variants) is a demon featured in German folklore. He originally appeared in literature as the demon in the Faust legend, and he has since appeared in other works as a stock character (see: Mephistopheles in the arts and popular culture).  Etymology  Salar Jung. Traditional scholars of Germanic mythology commonly use the spelling \\"Mephistopholes,\\" based on a transliteral understanding of the 15th century spelling of the character . The word may derive from the Hebrew ◊û÷µ◊§÷¥◊ô◊• (m√™pÃÑ√Æ·π£) which means \\"scatterer, disperser\\", and tophel, short for ◊ò÷´◊§÷∂◊ú ◊©÷∂◊Å÷´◊ß÷∂◊® (t≈çpÃÑel ≈°eqer) which means \\"plasterer of lies\\". The name can also be a combination of three Greek words: ŒºŒÆ (m·∏ó) as a negation, œÜ·ø∂œÇ (ph≈çÃÉs) meaning \\"light\\", and œÜŒπŒªŒπœÇ \\"philis\\" meaning \\"loving\\", making it mean \\"not-light- loving\\", possibly parodying the Latin \\"Lucifer\\" or \\"light-bearer\\".  Inside the Faust legend  MEPHISTO_PHILES in the 1527 Praxis Magia Faustiana, attributed to Faust. The name Mephistopheles is associated with the Faust legend of an ambitious scholar, based on the historical Johann Georg Faust. In the legend, Faust makes a deal with the Devil at the price of his soul, Mephistopheles acting as the Devil's agent. The name appears in the late-16th- century Faust chapbooks- stories concerning the life of Johann Georg Faust, written by an anonymous German author. In the 1725 version, which Goethe read, Mephostophiles is a devil in the form of a greyfriar summoned by Faust in a wood outside Wittenberg. From the chapbooks, the name entered Faustian literature. Many authors have used it, from Goethe to Christopher Marlowe. In the 1616 edition of Marlowe's The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, Mephostophiles became Mephistophilis. Mephistopheles in later treatments of the Faust material frequently figures as a title character: in Meyer Lutz' Mephistopheles, or Faust and Marguerite (1855), Arrigo Boito's Mefistofele (1868), Klaus Mann's Mephisto, and Franz Liszt's Mephisto Waltzes. There are also many parallels with the character of Mephistopheles and the character Lord Henry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/interdisciplinaryandcreativecollaboration/faustbooks/doriangray/  Interpretations  Mephistopheles by Mark Antokolsky, 1884. Although Mephistopheles appears to Faustus as a demon ‚Äì a worker for Lucifer ‚Äì critics claim that he does not search for men to corrupt, but comes to serve and ultimately collect the souls of those who are already damned. Farnham explains, \\"Nor does Mephistophiles first appear to Faustus as a devil who walks up and down on earth to tempt and corrupt any man encountered. He appears because he senses in Faustus' magical summons that Faustus is already corrupt, that indeed he is already 'in danger to be damned'.\\" Mephistopheles is already trapped in his own Hell by serving the Devil. He warns Faustus of the choice he is making by \\"selling his soul\\" to the devil: \\"Mephistophilis, an agent of Lucifer, appears and at first advises Faust not to forego the promise of heaven to pursue his goals\\".Krstovic, J.

Farming Mills, MI: The Gale Group, 1999: 202 Farnham adds to his theory, \\"...[Faustus] enters an ever- present private hell like that of Mephistophiles\\".Krstovic & Lazzardi 1999, p. 8  Outside the Faust legend  Shakespeare mentions \\"Mephistophilus\\" in the Merry Wives of Windsor (Act I, Scene I, line 128), and by the 17th century the name became independent of the Faust legend. According to Burton Russell,Burton Russell 1992, p. 61 \\"That the name is a purely modern invention of uncertain origins makes it an elegant symbol of the modern Devil with his many novel and diverse forms\\". Mephistopheles is also featured as the lead antagonist in Goethe's Faust, and in the unpublished scenarios for die Walpurgis-Nacht (German for \\"the Walpurgis-Night\\"), he and Satan appear as two separate characters.

Plot When an IRA terrorist car bomb explodes, the wife and children of molecular biologist John Roe O'Neill are indiscriminately killed on May 20, 1996. Driven halfway insane by loss, his mind fragments into several personalities that carry out his plan for him. He plans a gendercidal revenge and creates a plague that kills only women, but for which men are the carriers. O'Neill then releases it in Ireland (for supporting the terrorists), England (for oppressing the Irish and giving them a cause), and Libya (for training said terrorists); he demands that the governments of the world send all citizens of those countries back to their countries, and that they quarantine those countries and let the plague run its course, so they will lose what he has lost; if they do not, he has more plagues to release. After releasing the plague, he goes to Ireland to hide, planning to offer his services as a molecular biologist in the hopes of sabotaging whatever work is done there on finding a cure. When he arrives in Ireland, he is suspected of being O'Neill (whom the investigatory agencies of the world have deduced is responsible). To travel to the lab at Killaloe, he is forced to walk with a priest, a boy who has taken a vow of silence due to the death of his mother, and Joseph Herity, the IRA bomber who detonated the explosive that killed O'Neill's wife and children; their purpose is to confirm his identity, either through Herity's indirect questioning, or the possibility that he will confess to the priest when confronted with the pain his revenge has caused for the boy. Meanwhile, law and order have broken down in England and Ireland, and the old Irish ways are coming back. Local IRA thugs appoint themselves \\"kings of old\\", and others recreate ancient Celtic pagan religions centered on the rowan tree. The IRA has effective control of Ireland, but as the governments of the world grow certain that O'Neill is there and essentially in custody, they consider wiping out the three targeted countries to end the lingering threat. Major themes Most of the drama is mental, political, and communal. While the story of O'Neill and his revenge is told in full, there is also the larger story of how the governments of the world's countries deal with the plague, which escapes into limited areas that are quickly sterilized by \\"panic fire\\", which immolates everything and everyone in it. North Africa is wiped out; Boston is burned to the ground; Rome is destroyed with atomic bombs; and the US pushes for a moat of cobalt dust to isolate Africa, which is written off as a total loss. The world's armed forces are reorganized under a Canadian Admiral, Francois Delacourt, who heads Barrier Command, responsible for the absolute separation of contaminated and clean areas. Scientists toy with a conspiracy of intellectuals to override the expected repression of research by governments. In countries around the world, angry mobs lynch Irish, English, Libyans, and anyone too closely resembling them. The plague also has major social repercussions. The book implies near the end that polyandry will necessarily become mandatory, potentially giving women involved in such marriages enhanced power. Reception Dave Langford reviewed The White Plague for White Dwarf #41, and stated that \\"There's plenty of edge-of-the-seat suspense and good thumping melodrama in the race to crack the gene-structure of the plague while a few women are still left alive.\\" =Awards= The White Plague was nominated for a Locus Award for best science fiction novel in 1983, but lost to Isaac Asimov's novel Foundation's Edge.

Established in 1978 a few years after Lowell Heritage State Park, it is operated by the National Park Service and comprises a group of different sites in and around the city of Lowell related to the era of textile manufacturing in the city during the Industrial Revolution. In 2019, the park was included as Massachusetts' representative in the America the Beautiful Quarters series. History :See the History of Lowell, Massachusetts article for a detailed history of the city First settled by Europeans in the 17th century, East Chelmsford (later renamed Lowell in honor of the founders' deceased business partner) became an important manufacturing center along the Merrimack River in the early 1820s. It was seen as an attractive site for the construction of a planned industrial city, with the Middlesex Canal (completed in 1803) linking the Merrimack to the Charles River, which flows through Boston, and with the powerful 32' Pawtucket Falls. The already existent Pawtucket Canal, designed for transportation around the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack, became the feeder canal for a 5.6-mile long system of power canals based around the falls. Unlike many other mill towns, however, Lowell's manufacturing facilities were built based on a planned community design. Specifically Lowell was planned as reaction to the mill communities in Great Britain, which were perceived as cramped and inhumane. Some called it the \\"Lowell Experiment,\\" which was an attempt at creating a manufacturing center with a combination of production efficiency with democratic morals and social structure. Initially the factories of Lowell were built with ample green space and accompanying clean dormitories, in a style that anticipated such later architectural trends as the City Beautiful movement in the 1890s. Lowell attracted both immigrants from abroad and migrants from within New England and Quebec (including a large proportion of young women, known as Lowell mill girls) who lived in the dormitories and worked in the mills. The textile industry in New England experienced a sharp decline after World War II and by the 1960s, many of the Lowell's textile mill buildings were abandoned. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several important forces came together from which emerged the Lowell National Historical Park. Congressman F. Bradford Morse assisted in the city's selection for \\"Model Cities\\" status; Brendan Fleming, UMass Lowell (UML) Math Department faculty member, after his election to the Lowell City Council proposed the first Historic District \\"The Mill and Canal District\\" which was approved in 1972; Gordon Marker, Executive Director of Model Cities and an urban planner, was instrumental in designing the concept for an Urban Park based on Historic Preservation and Economic Revitalization; Patrick Mogan, Education Administrator and later Superintendent of Schools, was primarily interested in Lowell's children and strongly advocated the preservation and sharing of their cultural experiences; and the Lowell Historical Society which opened the Lowell Museum in 1976. Together these circles of interest became a collaborating force led by United States Senator and Lowell native Paul Tsongas to enact legislation for a national park. In 1978, the United States Congress established the Lowell National Historical Park, the Lowell Historic Preservation District, and the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission. In 1990, The Trust for Public Land assisted the National Park Service in acquiring 3 acres for the purpose of housing the headquarters for the Lowell National Historical Park. Legislative History of Lowell Lowell National Historic Park was established by the Lowell Establishment Act in 1978. Lowell National Historical Park was established due to its significant cultural and historical sites and structures. This significance of these cultural and historical sites and structures symbolized aspects of the Industrial Revolution. Lowell is also represented to be the most significant planned industrialized city in the United States, which is a very important historical aspect in United States history. Another factor is that the immigration of different ethnic groups during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was represented in Lowell‚Äôs neighborhoods. Preserving this area of land would allow for these representations to still be preserved in Lowell‚Äôs neighborhoods. Even though the city of Lowell had a large budget for cultural and historical preservation, they would still need the assistance of the federal government to ensure that all necessary early buildings and structures were preserved. The extra protection and funding by the federal government will allow for the preservation of these lands. By establishing Lowell as a National Park that is protected by the federal government, the history and significance of the Industrial Revolution, as well as cultural aspects would be preserved and shared with present and future generations. In 2012, The Lowell National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of 2012 was added to the original legislation to allow for land within park boundaries to be exchanged with land owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the city of Lowell, or the University of Massachusetts building authority. Lowell National Historic Park is an originally established park and did not replace a previously established site. Administrative History of Lowell Chronological Order of Superintendents: 1\\\\.

The visitor center provides a free self-guided tour of the history of Lowell, including display exhibits such as the patent model of a loom by local inventor S. Thomas. A footpath along the Merrimack Canal from the visitor center is lined with plaques describing the importance of various existing and former sites along the canal. The Boott Mills along the Merrimack River, on the Eastern Canal, is the most fully restored manufacturing site in the district, and one of the oldest. The Boott Mill provides a walk-through museum with living recreations of the textile manufacturing process in the 19th century. The walking tour includes a detour to a memorial to local author Jack Kerouac, who described the mid-20th century declined state of Lowell in several of his books. A walkway along the river leads to several additional unrestored mill sites, providing views of restored and unrestored canal raceways once used by the mills. Additionally, the park includes the Patrick J Mogan Cultural Center, which focuses on the lives of Lowell's many generations of immigrants. Other exhibits include a working streetcar line, canal boat tours exploring some of the city's gatehouses and locks, and the River Transformed / Suffolk Mill Turbine Exhibit, which shows how water power, the Francis Turbine, ran Lowell's textile factories. Current Challenges There is a common theme in the challenges that Lowell has passed in the past decade, and this is lack of funding from the government. In February of 2013, Congress was discussing five percent budget cuts for the National Park Service. The National Parks that would have been affected by these budget cuts, including Lowell, needed to create reports about how they would ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù these budget cuts. The effects from the budget cuts were not 100% clear at the time, but based on what this budget was used for, there would be large impacts on the staff within the park. One of the impacts they discussed for staffing would‚Äôve been ‚Äúa hiring freeze in place and the furloughing of permanent staff.‚Äù In December of 2013, the government shutdown had a major impact on the budgets in Lowell. During this time, only a few security and maintenance workers were able to still work in the park, meaning all of the interpretation staff was not. Without the presence of these staff members, all tours, boat rides, etc. could not occur. This shutdown also had a large impact on the budget for the park, as well as how many fulltime staff members they could pay. However, Lowell had one mission and that was to ‚Äúfocus on its major programs.‚Äù Lowell has a Folk Festival every year as well as a Summer Music Series. These are large events that Lowell looks forward to every year and they both bring in a lot of money for the city. So even though it would be a challenge, Lowell was still willing to fight and find a way to have their major events occur. This article also discusses a major point that relates back to the other article I discussed in the previous paragraph. There was a decrease in both permanent and seasonal positions in the park within a two-year period, and at this point in time, there were 80 people working in the park full time and about 12 seasonally. With these reductions and limitations, there were workers performing tasks outside their scope of knowledge, as well as causing some attractions hours to be cut shorter during the day. In December of 2014, superintendent Celeste Bernardo was faced with the conflict of possibility having to increase the fees for education programs and boat rides within the park. It was not something she wanted to do but needed to find a solution to a budget cut problem that would ‚Äúmake things better.‚Äù This meaning that they did not need the increase in fees to save the park. They wanted to increase the fees so that the money could be used to improve the park. This park took a huge hit when it came to budget cuts within a 6-year period. In 2008, Lowell had 88 permanent employees within the park. That number was dropped to 66 in 2014 due to these dramatic budget cuts. The biggest conflict they had with this fee increases what that they wanted to keep these prices low for those people who live in areas of poverty. Lowell is within a city that has these areas and wanted to keep it a place where all people could comfortably enjoy the park. People from the community were able to share their opinions on a public discussion board online. Lowell continues to struggle with budget cuts to this day.

Her work was significant to the development of Paris Dada and modernism and her drawings and collages explore fascinating gender dynamics. Due to the fact that she was a woman in the male prominent Dada movement, she was rarely considered an artist in her own right. She constantly lived in the shadows of her famous older brothers, who were also artists, or she was referred to as \\"the wife of.\\" Her work in painting turns out to be significantly influential to the landscape of Dada in Paris and to the interests of women in Dada. She took a large role as an avant-garde artist, working through a career that spanned five decades, during a turbulent time of great societal change. She used her work to express certain subject matter such as personal concerns about modern society, her role as a modern woman artist, and the effects of the First World War. Her work often weaves painting, collage, and language together in complex ways.  Early life and education  Suzanne was born in Blainville-Crevon, Seine-Maritime in the Haute-Normandie Region of France, near Rouen. She was the fourth of six children born into the artistic family of Justin Isidore (Eug√®ne) Duchamp (1848-1925) and Marie Caroline Lucie (1860-1925). Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti was the younger sister of famous artists Jacques Villon n√©e Gaston Duchamp, a painter and printmaker, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, a sculptor, and Marcel Duchamp, a painter, sculptor and author. She was closest in age and temperament to Marcel Duchamp, forming and maintaining a close bond and emotional attachment with him throughout their lives. Scholars, such as Arturo Schwarz, have speculated that there may have been an incestuous relationship between the two, although that was influenced by Freudian school of thought at the time. She began her studies as a painter at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in her native Rouen when she was sixteen years old in 1905. Her early works reflected styles ranging from Intimism and Fauvism to Impressionism and a conservative Cubism, often depicting family and childhood scenes around Rouen. From 1909-1910, Marcel and Suzanne participated together in the activities of the Soci√©t√© Normande de de Peinture Moderne, an artists' group based in Rouen. Through this group, she was exposed to avant-garde trends. At age 21, in 1911, she married a local pharmacist named Charles Desmares but quickly divorced, moving to Paris to serve as a nurse during the First World War, living in Marcel's apartment in rue la Condamine. She worked in the H√¥tel des Invalides, one of the largest French military hospitals. During this time, she continued to work as an artist, establishing a presence in the Parisian quarter of Montparnasse and often asking Marcel for feedback or advice.  Early work  alt= 'Head of Man' by Suzanne Duchamp, 1921, Yale University Art Gallery In late 1915, Suzanne went to clear out Marcel's studio in Paris and this is when/where she first learned about his readymades. Between 1916 and 1921 she produced a significant body of work in a formal language that has come to be called 'mechanomorphic' - images taken from commonplace mechanical or technological objects arranged to describe or infer human agency, desire or behavior. The work of Francis Picabia typifies the mechanomorphic tendency. In a letter from Marcel written in January 1916, Marcel elaborated on his concept of the ready-mades and mentioned the Bicycle Wheel and the Bottlerack which she should have encountered in the studio. He asked her to complete one of them by adding the inscription \\"d'apr√®s Marcel Duchamp,\\" which translates to \\"after Marcel Duchamp.\\" This collaboration with Marcel exhibited his trust in Suzanne about her openness towards radical art production. In 1916, Suzanne met Jean Crotti, an artist who worked in the same studio as Marcel. During this time is when her first surge of activity occurred, creating some of her best work. She produced \\"Un et une menac√©s,\\" \\"A Threatened Male and Female\\" which references mechanical symbolism as well as real machine parts, which greatly lends itself to the Dadaist movement. One of her most noteworthy works is Multiplication Broken and Restored, completed in 1919. The composition contains Dadaist imagery with man-made objects such as a tower and cityscape. It is also believed that this piece comes directly from her private experience rather than being a severe critique of cultural norms. After the war ended, Suzanne and Jean married in Paris in 1919. As a wedding present, Marcel sent them instructions for a readymade which involved suspending a geometry textbook on the porch and letting the wind and rain gradually tear it apart. During this time, Dada was gaining traction in Paris due to figures like Tristan Tzara. Jean and Suzanne were not very involved until 21, but both exhibited three works in the prestigious Salon des Ind√®pendants, alongside artists such as Francis Picabia. The art emphasized was that of the provocative mecanomorphic style. After this, Suzanne continued to work on her dadaist oeuvre, creating more delicate watercolor or gouache paintings. One of these paintings is \\"Marcel's Unhappy Readymade,\\" depicting the geometry textbook she received from him as a gift. Interestingly, Suzanne inverted the painting so that it was presented upside down. Completed in 1920, her work Ariette of Oblivion in the Thoughtless Chapel is regarded as the strongest Dadaist work that she created with seemingly nonsense inscriptions and mechanical imagery. However, much like Multiplication Broken and Restored, the inspiration for this piece emerged from the devotion she experienced in her relationship. This personal perspective runs contrary to the Dada sentiment of criticizing social conventions and undermining culture. In 1921, Jean and Suzanne sign, along with 20 other artists, the Dada soul√©ve tout, a manifesto created by Tristan Tzara to rebuke the increasingly fascist Italian Futurist, Marinetti.Hemus, Ruth. \\"Dada's female form : the interventions of five women artists, writers and performers in the European Dada movement\\". University of Edinburgh, 2006. p192 https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.652320 In April 1921, she exhibited with Crotti at the Tabu exhibition the Salon d'Autonme, (at the Galerie Montaigne in Paris); this was a few weeks before the Dada Salon at the same location. In later years, Duchamp and Crotti moved further away from Dada calling their work 'Tabu'. The Tabu pieces were more geometric and abstract, seeking certain universal tropes, but still reveal a highly personalized symbolic language. Tabu works drew on a range of domestic or everyday issues, simplified and combined in often striking ways. These works never brought the acclaim of Duchamp's earlier mechanomorphic pieces and are not discussed widely in literature on the artist.  Later life  Throughout her life, Suzanne continues to participate in exhibitions, such as the \\"Femmes Peintures Fran√ßais\\" exhibition at Galerie Barbazanges, organized by women artists wanting recognition in the art world. She also exhibited along with Marie Laurencin in \\"Les Femmes Artistes d'Europe\\" at the Mus√©e du Jeu de Paume in 1937. In 1945, after the war, Suzanne Duchamp becomes a member of the Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs and regularly exhibited landscapes, portraits, and flower still lifes at its salons. In 1967, in Rouen, France, her brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris. She died in Neuilly-sur-Seine (Seine-Saint-Denis), France in 1963, within a month of being diagnosed with a brain tumor. References *Tomkins, Calvin, Duchamp: A Biography.

A multiple recipient of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, she became in 1995 the first science-fiction writer to receive a MacArthur Fellowship.Crossley, Robert. \\"Critical Essay.\\" In Kindred, by Octavia Butler. Boston: Beacon, 2004. (10) (13) After her father died, Butler was raised by her widowed mother. Extremely shy as a child, Octavia found an outlet at the library reading fantasy, and in writing. She began writing science fiction as a teenager. She attended community college during the Black Power movement, and while participating in a local writer's workshop was encouraged to attend the Clarion Workshop, which focused on science fiction. She soon sold her first stories and by the late 1970s had become sufficiently successful as an author that she was able to pursue writing full- time. Her books and short stories drew the favorable attention of the public and awards judges. She also taught writer's workshops, and eventually relocated to Washington state. Butler died of a stroke at the age of 58. Her papers are held in the research collection of the Huntington Library.  Early life  Octavia Estelle Butler was born in Pasadena, California, the only child of Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshine man. Butler's father died when she was seven. She was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother in what she would later recall as a strict Baptist environment. Growing up in the racially integrated community of Pasadena allowed Butler to experience cultural and ethnic diversity in the midst of racial segregation. She accompanied her mother to her cleaning work, where the two entered white people's houses through back doors, as workers. Her mother was treated poorly by her employers.\\"Butler, Octavia E.

Her awkwardness, paired with a slight dyslexia that made schoolwork a torment, made Butler an easy target for bullies, and led her to believe that she was \\"ugly and stupid, clumsy, and socially hopeless\\". As a result, she frequently passed the time reading at the Pasadena Central Library.Smalls, F. Romall. \\"Butler, Octavia Estelle\\", in Arnold Markoe, Karen Markoe, and Kenneth T. Jackson (eds), The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Vol. 8: 2006‚Äì2008. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2010. 65‚Äì66. She also wrote reams of pages in her \\"big pink notebook\\". Hooked at first on fairy tales and horse stories, she quickly became interested in science fiction magazines, such as Amazing Stories, Galaxy Science Fiction, and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. She began reading stories by John Brunner, Zenna Henderson, and Theodore Sturgeon.McCaffery, Larry, and Jim McMenamin, \\"An Interview with Octavia Butler\\", in Larry McCaffery (ed.), Across the Wounded Galaxies: Interviews with Contemporary American Science Fiction Writers, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1990. At the age of 10, Butler begged her mother to buy her a Remington typewriter, on which she \\"pecked [her] stories two fingered\\". At 12, she watched the televised version of the film Devil Girl from Mars (1954) and concluded that she could write a better story. She drafted what would later become the basis for her Patternist novels. Happily ignorant of the obstacles that a black female writer could encounter, she became unsure of herself for the first time at the age of 13, when her well-intentioned aunt Hazel said: \\"Honey ... Negroes can't be writers.\\" But Butler persevered in her desire to publish a story, and even asked her junior high school science teacher, Mr. Pfaff, to type the first manuscript she submitted to a science fiction magazine.Logan, Robert W. \\"Butler, Octavia E.\\", in Darlene Clark Hine (ed.), Black Women in America: A Historical Encyclopedia, 2nd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. After graduating from John Muir High School in 1965, Butler worked during the day and attended Pasadena City College (PCC) at night. As a freshman at PCC, she won a college-wide short-story contest, earning her first income ($15) as a writer. She also got the \\"germ of the idea\\" for what would become her novel Kindred. An African-American classmate involved in the Black Power Movement loudly criticized previous generations of African Americans for being subservient to whites. As Butler explained in later interviews, the young man's remarks were a catalyst that led her to respond with a story providing historical context for the subservience, showing that it could be understood as silent but courageous survival. In 1968, Butler graduated from PCC with an associate of arts degree with a focus in history.  Rise to success  Although Butler's mother wanted her to become a secretary in order to have a steady income, Butler continued to work at a series of temporary jobs. She preferred less demanding work that would allow her to get up at two or three in the morning to write. Success continued to elude her. She styled her stories after the white-and-male-dominated science fiction she had grown up reading. She enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, but switched to taking writing courses through UCLA Extension. During the Open Door Workshop of the Writers Guild of America West, a program designed to mentor minority writers, her writing impressed one of the teachers, noted science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison. He encouraged her to attend the six- week Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop in Clarion, Pennsylvania. There, Butler met the writer Samuel R. Delany, who became a longtime friend. She also sold her first stories: \\"Childfinder\\" to Ellison, for his anthology The Last Dangerous Visions (still unpublished), and \\"Crossover\\" to Robin Scott Wilson, the director of Clarion, who published it in the 1971 Clarion anthology. For the next five years, Butler worked on the series of novels that later become known as the Patternist series: Patternmaster (1976), Mind of My Mind (1977), and Survivor (1978). In 1978, she was finally able to stop working at temporary jobs and live on her writing. She took a break from the Patternist series to research and write Kindred (1979), and then finished the series with Wild Seed (1980) and Clay's Ark (1984). Butler's rise to prominence began in 1984 when \\"Speech Sounds\\" won the Hugo Award for Short Story and, a year later, Bloodchild won the Hugo Award, the Locus Award, and the Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award for Best Novelette. In the meantime, Butler traveled to the Amazon rainforest and the Andes to do research for what would become the Xenogenesis trilogy: Dawn (1987), Adulthood Rites (1988), and Imago (1989). These stories were republished in 2000 as the collection Lilith's Brood. During the 1990s, Butler worked on the novels that solidified her fame as a writer: Parable of the Sower (1993) and Parable of the Talents (1998). In 1995, she became the first science-fiction writer to be awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation fellowship, an award that came with a prize of $295,000.Holden, Rebecca J, and Nisi Shawl. Strange Matings: Science Fiction, Feminism, African American Voices, and Octavia E.

In 1999, after her mother's death, Butler moved to Lake Forest Park, Washington. The Parable of the Talents had won the Science Fiction Writers of America's Nebula Award for Best Science Novel, and she had plans for four more Parable novels: Parable of the Trickster, Parable of the Teacher, Parable of Chaos, and Parable of Clay. However, after several failed attempts to begin The Parable of the Trickster, she decided to stop work in the series.Butler, Octavia E.

In later interviews, Butler explained that the research and writing of the Parable novels had overwhelmed and depressed her, so she had shifted to composing something \\"lightweight\\" and \\"fun\\" instead. This became her last book, the science-fiction vampire novel Fledgling (2005).Butler, Octavia. \\"Science Fiction Writer Octavia Butler on Race, Global Warming, and Religion.\\" Interview by Juan Gonzalez and Amy Goodman. Democracy Now! November 11, 2005. Writing career =Early stories, Patternist series, and Kindred: 1971‚Äì1984= Butler's first work published was \\"Crossover\\" in the 1971 Clarion Workshop anthology. She also sold the short story \\"Childfinder\\" to Harlan Ellison for the anthology The Last Dangerous Visions. \\"I thought I was on my way as a writer\\", Butler recalled in her short fiction collection Bloodchild and Other Stories. \\"In fact, I had five more years of rejection slips and horrible little jobs ahead of me before I sold another word.\\"Butler, Octavia E. \\"Afterword to Crossover.\\" Bloodchild and Other Stories. New York, NY: Seven Stories Press. 1996. p. 120. Starting in 1974, Butler worked on a series of novels that would later be collected as the Patternist series, which depicts the transformation of humanity into three genetic groups: the dominant Patternists, humans who have been bred with heightened telepathic powers and are bound to the Patternmaster via a psionic chain; their enemies the Clayarks, disease-mutated animal-like superhumans; and the Mutes, ordinary humans bonded to the Patternists. The first novel, Patternmaster (1976), eventually became the last installment in the series' internal chronology. Set in the distant future, it tells of the coming-of-age of Teray, a young Patternist who fights for position within Patternist society and eventually for the role of Patternmaster. Next came Mind of My Mind (1977), a prequel to Patternmaster set in the 20th century. The story follows the development of Mary, the creator of the psionic chain and the first Patternmaster to bind all Patternists, and her inevitable struggle for power with her father Doro, a parapsychological vampire who seeks to retain control over the psionic children he has bred over the centuries. The third book of the series, Survivor, was published in 1978. The titular survivor is Alanna, the adopted child of the Missionaries, fundamentalist Christians who have traveled to another planet to escape Patternist control and Clayark infection. Captured by a local tribe called the Tehkohn, Alanna learns their language and adopts their customs, knowledge which she then uses to help the Missionaries avoid bondage and assimilation into a rival tribe that opposes the Tehkohn.Bogstad, Janice. \\"Octavia E. Butler and Power Relations.\\" Janus 4.4 (1978‚Äì79): 28‚Äì31. Butler would later call Survivor the least favorite of her books, and withdraw it from reprinting. After Survivor, Butler took a break from the Patternist series to write what would become her best-selling novel, Kindred (1979), as well as the short story \\"Near of Kin\\" (1979). In Kindred, Dana, an African-American woman, is transported from 1976 Los Angeles to early 19th-century Maryland. She meets her ancestors: Rufus, a white slave holder, and Alice, a black freewoman forced into slavery later in life. In \\"Near of Kin\\" the protagonist discovers a taboo relationship in her family as she goes through her mother's things after her death. In 1980, Butler published the fourth book of the Patternist series, Wild Seed, whose narrative became the series' origin story. Set in Africa and America during the 17th century, Wild Seed traces the struggle between the four-thousand- year-old parapsychological vampire Doro and his \\"wild\\" child and bride, the three-hundred-year-old shapeshifter and healer Anyanwu. Doro, who has bred psionic children for centuries, deceives Anyanwu into becoming one of his breeders, but she eventually escapes and uses her gifts to create communities that rival Doro's. When Doro finally tracks her down, Anyanwu, tired by decades of escaping or fighting Doro, decides to commit suicide, forcing him to admit his need for her. In 1983, Butler published \\"Speech Sounds\\", a story set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles where a pandemic has caused most humans to lose their ability to read, speak, or write. For many, this impairment is accompanied by uncontrollable feelings of jealousy, resentment, and rage. \\"Speech Sounds\\" received the 1984 Hugo Award for Best Short Story. In 1984, Butler released the last book of the Patternmaster series, Clay's Ark. Set in the Mojave Desert, it focuses on a colony of humans infected by an extraterrestrial microorganism brought to Earth by the one surviving astronaut of the spaceship Clay's Ark. As the microorganism compels them to spread it, they kidnap ordinary people to infect them and, in the case of women, give birth to the mutant, sphinx-like children who will be the first members of the Clayark race. =Bloodchild and the Xenogenesis trilogy: 1984‚Äì1989= Butler followed Clay's Ark with the critically acclaimed short story \\"Bloodchild\\" (1984). Set on an alien planet, it depicts the complex relationship between human refugees and the insect-like aliens who keep them in a preserve to protect them, but also to use them as hosts for breeding their young. Sometimes called Butler's \\"pregnant man story\\", \\"Bloodchild\\" won the Nebula, Hugo, and Locus Awards, and the Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award. Three years later, Butler published Dawn, the first installment of what would become known as the Xenogenesis trilogy. The series examines the theme of alienation by creating situations in which humans are forced to coexist with other species to survive and extends Butler's recurring exploration of genetically- altered, hybrid individuals and communities. In Dawn, protagonist Lilith Iyapo finds herself in a spaceship after surviving a nuclear apocalypse that destroys Earth. Saved by the Oankali aliens, the human survivors must combine their DNA with an ooloi, the Oankali's third sex, in order to create a new race that eliminates a self-destructive flaw in humans‚Äîtheir aggressive hierarchical tendencies. Butler followed Dawn with \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\\" (1987), a story about how certain female sufferers of \\"Duryea-Gode Disease\\", a genetic disorder which causes dissociative states, obsessive self-mutilation, and violent psychosis, are able to control others afflicted with the disease. Adulthood Rites (1988) and Imago (1989), the second and the third books in the Xenogenesis trilogy, focus on the predatory and prideful tendencies that affect human evolution, as humans now revolt against Lilith's Oankali-engineered progeny. Set thirty years after humanity's return to Earth, Adulthood Rites centers on the kidnapping of Lilith's part- human, part alien child, Akin, by a human-only group who are against the Oankali. Akin learns about both aspects of his identity through his life with the humans as well as the Akjai. The Oankali-only group becomes their mediator, and ultimately creates a human-only colony in Mars. In Imago, the Oankali create a third species more powerful than themselves: the shape- shifting healer Jodahs, a human-Oankali ooloi who must find suitable human male and female mates to survive its metamorphosis and finds them in the most unexpected of places, in a village of renegade humans. =The Parable series: 1993‚Äì1998= In the mid-1990s, Butler published two novels later designated as the Parable (or Earthseed) series. The books depict the struggle of the Earthseed community to survive the socioeconomic and political collapse of 21st-century America due to poor environmental stewardship, corporate greed, and the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor.Omry, Keren. \\"Octavia Butler (1947‚Äì2006)\\", in Yolanda Williams Page (ed.), Encyclopedia of African American Women Writers, Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 64‚Äì70. The books propose alternate philosophical views and religious interventions as solutions to such dilemmas. The first book in the series, Parable of the Sower (1993), introduces the fifteen-year-old protagonist, Lauren Oya Olamina, and is set in a dystopian California in the 2020s. Lauren, who suffers from a syndrome causing her to literally feel any physical pain she witnesses, struggles with the religious beliefs and physical isolation of her hometown Robledo. She forms a new belief system, Earthseed, which posits a future for the human race on other planets. When Robledo is destroyed and Lauren's family and neighbors killed, she and two other survivors flee north. Recruiting members of varying social backgrounds along the way, Lauren relocates her new group to Northern California, naming her new community Acorn. Her 1998 follow-up novel, Parable of the Talents, is set sometime after Lauren's death and is told through the excerpts of Lauren's journals as framed by the commentary of her estranged daughter, Larkin. It details the invasion of Acorn by right-wing fundamentalist Christians, Lauren's attempts to survive their religious \\"re- education\\", and the final triumph of Earthseed as a community and a doctrine.Allbery, Russ. \\"Review of Parable of the Talents\\". Eyrie.org. April 5, 2006. In between her Earthseed novels, Butler published the collection Bloodchild and Other Stories (1995), which includes the short stories \\"Bloodchild\\", \\"The Evening and the Morning and the Night\\", \\"Near of Kin\\", \\"Speech Sounds\\", and \\"Crossover\\", as well as the non-fiction pieces \\"Positive Obsession\\" and \\"Furor Scribendi\\".Calvin, Ritch. \\"An Octavia E. Butler Bibliography (1976‚Äì2008)\\", Utopian Studies 19.3 (2008): 485‚Äì516. . =Late stories and Fledgling: 2003‚Äì2005= After several years of having writer's block, Butler published the short stories \\"Amnesty\\" (2003) and \\"The Book of Martha\\" (2003), and her second standalone novel, Fledgling (2005). Both short stories focus on how impossible conditions force an ordinary woman to make a distressing choice.Curtis, Claire P. \\"Theorizing Fear: Octavia Butler and the Realist Utopia.\\" Utopian Studies 19.3 (2008): 411‚Äì431. . In \\"Amnesty\\", an alien abductee recounts her painful abuse at the hand of the unwitting aliens, and upon her release, by humans, and explains why she chose to work as a translator for the aliens now that the Earth's economy is in a deep depression. In \\"The Book of Martha\\", God asks a middle-aged African-American novelist to make one important change to fix humanity's destructive ways. Martha's choice‚Äîto make humans have vivid and satisfying dreams‚Äîmeans that she will no longer be able to do what she loves, writing fiction. These two stories were added to the 2005 edition of Bloodchild and Other Stories. Butler's last publication during her lifetime was Fledgling, a novel exploring the culture of a vampire community living in mutualistic symbiosis with humans. Set on the west coast, it tells of the coming-of-age of a young female hybrid vampire whose species is called Ina. The only survivor of a vicious attack on her families that left her an amnesiac, she must seek justice for her dead, build a new family, and relearn how to be Ina.  Later years and death  During her last years, Butler struggled with writer's block and depression, partly caused by the side effects of medication for high blood pressure. She continued writing and taught at Clarion's Science Fiction Writers' Workshop regularly. In 2005, she was inducted into Chicago State University's International Black Writers Hall of Fame. Butler died outside of her home in Lake Forest Park, Washington, on February 24, 2006, aged 58. Contemporary news accounts were inconsistent as to the cause of her death, with some reporting that she suffered a fatal stroke, and other indicating that she died of head injuries after falling and striking her head on her cobbled walkway. Another suggestion, backed by Locus magazine, is that a stroke caused the fall and hence the head injuries. Butler maintained a longstanding relationship with the Huntington Library and bequeathed her papers including manuscripts, correspondence, school papers, notebooks, and photographs to the library in her will. The collection, comprising 9062 pieces in 386 boxes, 1 volume, 2 binders and 18 broadsides, was made available to scholars and researchers in 2010. Themes = The critique of present-day hierarchies = In multiple interviews and essays, Butler explained her view of humanity as inherently flawed by an innate tendency towards hierarchical thinking which leads to intolerance, violence and, if not checked, the ultimate destruction of our species.\\"Butler, Octavia E.\\", American Ethnic Writers, Revised edn. Vol. 1. Pasadena, CA: Salem Press, 2009. 168‚Äì175. \\"Simple peck-order bullying\\", she wrote in her essay \\"A World without Racism\\",\\"A World without Racism.\\" NPR Weekend Edition Saturday. September 1, 2001. \\"is only the beginning of the kind of hierarchical behavior that can lead to racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, classism, and all the other 'isms' that cause so much suffering in the world.\\" Her stories, then, often replay humanity's domination of the weak by the strong as a type of parasitism. These \\"others\\", whether aliens, vampires, superhuman, or slave masters, find themselves defied by a protagonist who embodies difference, diversity, and change, so that, as John R. Pfeiffer notes, \\"[i]n one sense [Butler's] fables are trials of solutions to the self-destructive condition in which she finds mankind.\\" = The remaking of the human = In his essay on the sociobiological backgrounds of Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy, J. Adam Johns describes how Butler's narratives counteract the death drive behind the hierarchical impulse with an innate love of life (biophilia), particularly different, strange life.Johns, J. Adam. \\"Becoming Medusa: Octavia Butler's Lilith's Brood and Sociobiology.\\" Science Fiction Studies 37.3 (2010): 382‚Äì400. Specifically, Butler's stories feature gene manipulation, interbreeding, miscegenation, symbiosis, mutation, alien contact, rape, contamination, and other forms of hybridity as the means to correct the sociobiological causes of hierarchical violence.Ferreira, Maria Aline. \\"Symbiotic Bodies and Evolutionary Tropes in the Work of Octavia Butler.\\" Science Fiction Studies 37. 3 (November 2010): 401‚Äì415. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, \\"[i]n [Butler's] narratives the undoing of the human body is both literal and metaphorical, for it signifies the profound changes necessary to shape a world not organized by hierarchical violence.\\"Kilgore, De Witt Douglas, and Ranu Samantrai. \\"A Memorial to Octavia E. Butler.\\" Science Fiction Studies 37.3 (November 2010): 353‚Äì361. . The evolutionary maturity achieved by the bioengineered hybrid protagonist at the end of the story, then, signals the possible evolution of the dominant community in terms of tolerance, acceptance of diversity, and a desire to wield power responsibly. = The survivor as hero = Butler's protagonists are disenfranchised individuals who endure, compromise, and embrace radical change in order to survive. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, her stories focus on minority characters whose historical background makes them already intimate with brutal violation and exploitation, and therefore the need to compromise to survive. Even when endowed with extra abilities, these characters are forced to experience unprecedented physical, mental, and emotional distress and exclusion to ensure a minimal degree of agency and to prevent humanity from achieving self-destruction. In many stories, their acts of courage become acts of understanding, and in some cases, love, as they reach a crucial compromise with those in power. Ultimately, Butler's focus on disenfranchised characters serves to illustrate both the historical exploitation of minorities and how the resolve of one such exploited individual may bring on critical change. = The creation of alternative communities = Butler's stories feature mixed communities founded by African protagonists and populated by diverse, if similar-minded individuals. Members may be humans of African, European, or Asian descent, extraterrestrial (such as the N'Tlic in Bloodchild), from a different species (such as the vampiric Ina in Fledgling), and cross-species (such as the human- Oankali Akin and Jodahs in the Xenogenesis trilogy). In some stories, the community's hybridity results in a flexible view of sexuality and gender (for instance, the polyamorous extended families in Fledgling). Thus, Butler creates bonds between groups that are generally considered to be separate and unrelated, and suggests hybridity as \\"the potential root of good family and blessed community life\\". Many of her books feature father figures as wanderers and not tied to family units, perhaps due to her growing up without a father. Doro in 'Mind of my Mind' and the alien/human bred males in the Xenogenesis Trilogy for example. They also often feature the subservient protagonist being used for breeding plans planning and finally overcoming the authority figures. = Relationship to Afrofuturism = Butler's work has been associated with the genre of Afrofuturism,Sinker, Mark. \\"Loving the Alien.\\" The Wire 96 (February 1992): 30‚Äì32. a term coined by Mark Dery to describe \\"speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture\\".Bould, Mark. \\"The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF\\", Science Fiction Studies 34.2 (July 2007): 177‚Äì186. . Some critics, however, have noted that while Butler's protagonists are of African descent, the communities they create are multi- ethnic and, sometimes, multi-species. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai explain in their 2010 memorial to Butler, while Butler does offer \\"an afro-centric sensibility at the core of narratives\\", her \\"insistence on hybridity beyond the point of discomfort\\" exceeds the tenets of both black cultural nationalism and of \\"white-dominated\\" liberal pluralism.  Critical reception  Most critics praise Butler for her unflinching exposition of human flaws, which she depicts with striking realism. The New York Times regarded her novels as \\"evocative\\" and \\"often troubling\\" explorations of \\"far- reaching issues of race, sex, power\\". The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction called her examination of humanity \\"clear-headed and brutally unsentimental\\", and The Village Voices Dorothy Allison described her as \\"writing the most detailed social criticism\\" where \\"the hard edge of cruelty, violence, and domination is described in stark detail\\". Locus regarded her as \\"one of those authors who pay serious attention to the way human beings actually work together and against each other, and she does so with extraordinary plausibility.\\" The Houston Post ranked her \\"among the best SF writers, blessed with a mind capable of conceiving complicated futuristic situations that shed considerable light on our current affairs.\\" Scholars, on the other hand, focus on Butler's choice to write from the point of view of marginal characters and communities and thus \\"expanded SF to reflect the experiences and expertise of the disenfranchised\\". While surveying Butler's novels, critic Burton Raffel noted how race and gender influence her writing: \\"I do not think any of these eight books could have been written by a man, as they most emphatically were not, nor, with the single exception of her first book, Pattern-Master (1976), are likely to have been written, as they most emphatically were, by anyone but an African American.\\" Robert Crossley commended how Butler's \\"feminist aesthetic\\" works to expose sexual, racial, and cultural chauvinisms because it is \\"enriched by a historical consciousness that shapes the depiction of enslavement both in the real past and in imaginary pasts and futures.\\" Butler has been praised widely for her spare yet vivid style, with Washington Post Book World calling her craftsmanship \\"superb\\". Burton Raffel regards her prose as \\"carefully, expertly crafted\\" and \\"crystalline, at its best, sensuous, sensitive, exact, not in the least directed at calling attention to itself\\".Raffel, Burton. \\"Genre to the Rear, Race and Gender to the Fore: The Novels of Octavia E. Butler.\\" Literary Review 38.3 (Spring 1995): 454‚Äì61.  Influence  In interviews with Charles Rowell and Randall Kenan, Butler credited the struggles of her working-class mother as an important influence on her writing. . . Because Butler's mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was given the opportunity to learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books. She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her hard at work on a story casually remarked that maybe one day she could become a writer, causing Butler to realize that it was possible to make a living as an author. A decade later, Mrs. Butler would pay more than a month's rent to have an agent review her daughter's work. She also provided Butler with the money she had been saving for dental work to pay for Butler's scholarship so she could attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, where Butler sold her first two stories. A second person to play an influential role in Butler's work was the American writer Harlan Ellison. As a teacher at the Open Door Workshop of the Screen Writers Guild of America, he gave Butler her first honest and constructive criticism on her writing after years of lukewarm responses from composition teachers and baffling rejections from publishers. Impressed by her work, Ellison suggested she attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop and even contributed $100 towards her application fee. As the years passed, Ellison's mentorship became a close friendship. Butler herself has been highly influential in science fiction, particularly for people of color. In 2015, Adrienne Maree Brown and Walidah Imarisha co-edited Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements, a collection of 20 short stories and essays about social justice inspired by Butler. Toshi Reagon adapted Parable of the Sower into an opera. In 2020, adrienne maree brown and Toshi Reagon began collaborating on a podcast called Octavia's Parables.  Point of view  Butler began reading science fiction at a young age, but quickly became disenchanted by the genre's unimaginative portrayal of ethnicity and class as well as by its lack of noteworthy female protagonists.Smith Foster, Frances. \\"Octavia Butler's Black Female Future Fiction.\\" Extrapolation 23.1 (1982): 37‚Äì49. She determined to correct those gaps by, as De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai point out, \\"choosing to write self-consciously as an African-American woman marked by a particular history\\"‚Äîwhat Butler termed as \\"writing myself in\\". Butler's stories, therefore, are usually written from the perspective of a marginalized black woman whose difference from the dominant agents increases her potential for reconfiguring the future of her society.  Audience  Publishers and critics have labelled Butler's work as science fiction. While Butler enjoyed the genre deeply, calling it \\"potentially the freest genre in existence\\",Butler, Octavia. \\"Black Scholar Interview with Octavia Butler: Black Women and the Science Fiction Genre.\\" Frances M. Beal. Black Scholar (Mar/Apr. 1986): 14‚Äì18. . she resisted being branded a genre writer. Her narratives have drawn attention of people from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds. She claimed to have three loyal audiences: black readers, science-fiction fans, and feminists. Interviews Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 soon after she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. The highlights are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, \\"What then is central to what you want to say about race?\\" Butler's response was, \\"Do I want to say something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?\\" This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it. In an interview by Randall Kenan, Butler discusses how her life experiences as a child shaped most of her thinking. As a writer, she was able to use her writing as a vehicle to critique history under the lenses of feminism. In the interview, she discusses the research that had to be done in order to write her bestselling novel, Kindred. Most of it is based on visiting libraries as well as historic landmarks with respect to what she is investigating. Butler admits that she writes science fiction because she does not want her work to be labeled or used as a marketing tool. She wants the readers to be genuinely interested in her work and the story she provides, but at the same time she fears that people will not read her work because of the \\"science fiction\\" label that they have. In an interview with Joshunda Sanders, Butler commented on the space race and its influence on her work. She noted, \\"I think of the space race as a way of having a nuclear war without having one.\\" She claimed that Ronald Reagan believed a nuclear war against the Soviet Union was winnable. Butler admitted to being very confused by this idea, and said that it contributed to her idea for the Xenogenesis books. She said \\"there must be something basic, something really genetically wrong with us if we're falling for this stuff.\\" Butler then commented on how she felt a real fear about nuclear war during the Cold War and that these ideas had a real influence on some of her early works. In an interview with Marilyn Mehaffy and AnaLouise Keating, for MELUS, Octavia Butler talked about how biology is used to keep groups of people out of power. She said, \\"[w]hat's made of biology is that the people who are in power are going to figure out why this is a good reason for them to stay in power. Look at the tests that show that women have better linguistic abilities: Yet, how many of our ambassadors are women? How many of the politicians are women? This is not looked at; instead, the argument goes that women don't have the mathematical abilities ... every now and then. So we're much more likely now to be penalized for whatever we're assumed not to have. We're much more likely to find that whatever little genetic thing that's discovered is going to be used against us.\\" The issue of biology defining women and what they can and can't do has long been a part of feminism.\\"Women's Bodies: A Short Introduction\\".

Adaptations  Parable of the Sower was adapted as Parable of the Sower: The Opera, written by American folk/blues musician Toshi Reagon in collaboration with her mother, singer and composer Bernice Johnson Reagon. The adaptation's libretto and musical score combine African-American spirituals, soul, rock and roll, and folk music into rounds to be performed by singers sitting in a circle.

Butler Memorial Scholarship in Butler's memory, to enable writers of color to attend the annual Clarion West Writers Workshop and Clarion Writers' Workshop, descendants of the original Clarion Science Fiction Writers' Workshop in Clarion, Pennsylvania, where Butler got her start. The first scholarships were awarded in 2007. In March 2019, Butler's alma mater, Pasadena City College, announced the Octavia E. Butler Memorial Scholarship for students enrolled in the Pathways program and committed to transfer to four-year institutions. The memorial scholarships sponsored by the Carl Brandon Society and Pasadena City College help fulfill three of the life's goals Butler had handwritten in a notebook from 1988: > \\"I will send poor black youngsters to Clarion or other writer's workshops \\"I > will help poor black youngsters broaden their horizons \\"I will help poor > black youngsters go to college\\"  Selected works  A complete bibliography of Butler's work and secondary was compiled in 2008 by Calvin Ritch. = Series = Patternist series :* Patternmaster (Doubleday, 1976) :* Mind of My Mind (Doubleday, 1977) :* Survivor (Doubleday, 1978) :* Wild Seed (Doubleday, 1980) :* Clay's Ark (St. Martin's Press, 1984) :* Seed to Harvest (Grand Central Publishing 2007; omnibus excluding Survivor) Xenogenesis series :* Dawn (Warner, 1987) :* Adulthood Rites (Warner, 1988) :* Imago (Warner, 1989) :* Xenogenesis (Guild America Books, 1989) (an omnibus edition of Dawn, Adulthood Rites, & Imago) :* Lilith's Brood (Warner, 2000) (another omnibus edition of Dawn, Adulthood Rites, & Imago) Parable series (also called the Earthseed series) :* Parable of the Sower (Four Walls, Eight Windows, 1993) :* Parable of the Talents (Seven Stories Press, 1998) = Standalone novels = * Kindred (Doubleday, 1979) * Fledgling (Seven Stories Press, 2005) = Short story collections = * Bloodchild and Other Stories (Four Walls, Eight Windows, 1995; Seven Stories Press, 2005 including \\"Amnesty\\" and \\"The Book of Martha\\") * Unexpected Stories (2014, including \\"A Necessary Being\\" and \\"Childfinder\\") = Essays and speeches = * \\"Birth of a Writer.\\" Essence 20 (May 1989): 74+.

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, that saw the total destruction of the forces of the Wizard Saruman by the army of Rohan, assisted by a forest of tree-like Huorns. Helm's Deep is based on the Cheddar Gorge, a steep-sided limestone valley in the West of England, seen here in the 1890s Helm's Deep was a valley in the north-western White Mountains of Middle- earth. Helm's Deep, with its fortress the Hornburg, becomes the refuge of some of the army of Rohan, the Rohirrim, under King Th√©oden, from assault by the forces of Saruman. Although Th√©oden says that \\"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,\\" in the battle a massive army of Uruk-hai and Dunlendings sent by Saruman almost overwhelms the defences. Saruman's Orcs breach the fortress wall that blocks the valley by setting off an explosion in a culvert; Aragorn names it \\"Saruman's devilry\\" and \\"the fire of Orthanc\\"; the critic Tom Shippey calls it \\"a kind of gunpowder\\". The defenders hold out in the fortress until dawn, when Th√©oden and Aragorn lead a cavalry charge that drives the Orcs from the fortress. They are surprised to see the valley to the enemy's rear blocked by a forest of tree-like Huorns that have walked from Fangorn in the night. On the side of the valley are relieving forces assembled by Gandalf and Erkenbrand, a Rohirrim leader. These attack, driving the Orcs into the angry Huorn forest, from which the Orcs never emerge; the Huorns bury the Orcs's bodies in an earthen mound known as \\"Death's Down\\". Peter Jackson's 2002 film The Two Towers makes the battle dramatic, following Tolkien's account quite closely, but with changes to the forces involved: the attackers do not include men or wargs (battle-wolves), and the defenders include a group of Elf- warriors sent by Elrond, but except in the Extended DVD version do not include the Huorns. Tolkien based Helm's Deep on England's Cheddar Gorge, and the Glittering Caves of Aglarond on the cave complex that he had visited there. Fictional geography The caves in Cheddar Gorge inspired Tolkien's Glittering Caves of Aglarond, at the head of the gorge of Helm's Deep. Helm's Deep is based on the Cheddar Gorge, a limestone gorge 400 feet deep in the Mendip Hills, with a large cave complex that Tolkien visited on his honeymoon in 1916 and revisited in 1940, and which he acknowledged as the original of the Glittering Caves of Aglarond at the head of Helm's Deep, behind the fortress.Letters, Humphrey Carpenter, ed., p. 407 (1st paperback ed., Houghton Mifflin, 2000) Helm's Deep is properly the narrow gorge or ravine at the head of a larger valley (the Deeping-coomb), but the name is also used for the fortifications at the mouth of the gorge and the larger valley below.Letters, 210 The gorge, which wound deep into the White Mountains at the feet of the Thrihyrne mountain, led into the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, an extensive series of spectacular speleothems. In The Lord of the Rings, the Dwarf Gimli, who like all dwarves is well versed in geology, horrified that the caves are used only as a refuge, describes them lyrically: Sketch map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor in the Third Age. Helm's Deep is at top left, at the north of the Ered Nimrais mountains. Isengard, Saruman's fortress, is across the Gap of Rohan to the north, as is Fangorn forest, home to the Ents and Huorns. The mouth of the gorge, Helm's Gate, was closed by the battlemented Deeping Wall, 20 feet (6 metres) tall, and wide enough for four men to stand abreast, with a culvert for the Deeping-stream which flowed down the valley. At one end of the wall the Hornburg castle stood on a spur of the mountain; a long stair led to its rear gate, and a long causeway led down forwards from its main gate. About two furlongs (400 metres) down from the gate was an outer trench and rampart, Helm's Dike, built right across the Deeping-coomb. Tolkien drew detailed sketches of the fortifications. The valley was named for King Helm Hammerhand of Rohan, when he and his people sought refuge from the invading Dunlendings under Wulf during the winter of . Description =Background= Th√©oden had been released by the Wizard Gandalf from the influence of Gr√≠ma Wormtongue, his malevolent adviser and Saruman's spy. He then set out to the Fords of Isen, where his marshal Erkenbrand was fighting Saruman's forces. However, Th√©oden found out that his forces had been scattered. Gandalf advised him to take refuge in the Hornburg fortress of Helm's Deep. Gandalf then left on an unexplained errand. Th√©oden's army went to the area, where local people were commanded by a captain called Gamling the Old. Many of the men there were very old or young. The women and children of Th√©oden's capital Edoras were safe in Dunharrow, led by the King's niece √âowyn. The garrison of Helm's Deep consisted of some 1,000 men, but around 1,000 more defenders had arrived from across Rohan by the time of the battle.K. W. Fonstad, The Atlas of Middle- earth, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1981, p. 132 The enemy, Saruman's army, consisted of at least 10,000 Orcs and men, most marching from Isengard to Helm's Deep, and others heading to the Fords of Isen. An additional force of Men of Dunland joined the enemy. =The battle= Tolkien stated that the styles of the Bayeux Tapestry (detail shown) fitted the Rohirrim \\"well enough\\". The Orcs and Dunlendings arrived at Helm's Deep on a stormy night. They stormed the first defence, Helm's Dike, forcing the defenders to fall back to the fortress. They attempted to break down the gate with a battering ram, but a sortie led by Aragorn and √âomer briefly scattered the attackers. The Orcs raised ladders to scale the wall, but were held back by the Men of Rohan atop the wall. Orcs crept into the culvert and made a breach in the wall using a \\"blasting-fire\\" from Orthanc, perhaps \\"a kind of gunpowder\\"; Saruman's army rushed in. Some defenders retreated to the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, while others retreated to the Hornburg. Saruman's forces broke through the Hornburg gate just before dawn. At this moment, Helm's horn was sounded, and Th√©oden and Aragorn rode out, followed by all the Rohirrim left inside. They cut their way through the Orcs and drove them back from the fortress walls to Helm's Dike. As day dawned, both armies saw that a forest of angry, tree-like Huorns now filled the valley, trapping Saruman's army. Above them, Gandalf appeared on Shadowfax, with Erkenbrand and a thousand footsoldiers who had escaped from the Fords of Isen. They charged into the fray. The Dunlendings dropped their weapons, while the Orcs fled into the Huorn forest and were destroyed. Tolkien noted in a letter that he had created walking tree- creatures partly in response to his \\"bitter disappointment and disgust from schooldays with the shabby use made in Shakespeare's Macbeth of the coming of 'Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane hill': I longed to devise a setting in which the trees might really march to war\\".Letters, No. 163, footnote, pp. 211‚Äì212. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey calls it a \\"shock\\" that the battle is decided in this way. =Aftermath= After the battle, the Dunlendings were given amnesty by Erkenbrand and allowed to return home (much to their surprise, since Saruman had told them that the men of Rohan would burn all survivors alive). The Rohirrim required that all hostilities cease, and that the Dunlendings retreat behind the River Isen again and never recross while bearing arms. Before they were freed, though, the Dunlending captives were put to work in repairing the fortress. The bodies of the Orcs that had entered the forest of Huorns were never seen again; the Huorns had buried them in an earthen mound known as \\"Death's Down\\". Among the Rohirrim dead was H√°ma, captain of Th√©oden's personal guard and doorward of his hall; the Orcs had hewn his corpse, an atrocity that Th√©oden recalled during his later parley with Saruman. Gimli had been wounded, but had killed 42 Orcs to Legolas's 41. =Literary history= In Book III, ch. 5 of The Two Towers, Helm is described only as a \\"hero of old wars\\"; Tolkien did not envision him as a king when he wrote that chapter.The War of the Ring (The History of Middle-earth, vol VIII, p. 408) Tolkien had not yet envisioned Helm's Deep in his first sketch for the decisive battle between Rohan and the forces of Saruman. In an outline published in The Treason of Isengard as ‚ÄúThe Story Foreseen from Fangorn,\\" the Rohirrim rode west at Gandalf's urging, as in the published text, but met the army of Saruman on the open plain. An indecisive battle ensued, after which the Rohirrim camped for the night, and woke to see the enemy surrounded and destroyed by a wood that had appeared overnight.The Treason of Isengard (The History of Middle-earth, vol VII, p. 435-436) In a 1958 letter to Rhona Beare, one of a group of enthusiasts, Tolkien stated that the Rohirrim \\"were not 'Mediaeval' in our sense\\", but that all the same \\"the styles of the Bayeux Tapestry (made in England) fit them well enough\\", explaining that the soldiers in the tapestry are wearing chain-mail. =Later writings= After the publication of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien wrote about the history of Rohan, in writings now collected by his son Christopher in Unfinished Tales. These state that the fortresses of Aglarond and Angrenost (renamed Isengard by the Rohirrim) were built by Gondor to guard the shoulders of the Gap of Rohan. Like Angrenost to the north, it was initially well guarded, but as the population of Calenardhon dwindled it was not maintained and was left to a hereditary small guard who intermarried with Dunlendings. When Cirion, Steward of Gondor, gave Calenardhon to the √âoth√©od, Aglarond was transferred into the care of the Rohirrim, who named it S√∫thburg (\\"South-fortress\\" in Old English). The Gondorian guard was merged with that of Isengard. Guard duty of the Fords was initially shared between Gondor and Rohan, but later maintained only by the Rohirrim. Adaptations =Peter Jackson's film= The Battle of Helm's Deep in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers In Peter Jackson's 2002 film The Two Towers the keep was built into the mountainside. The entrance to the Glittering Caves of Aglarond is within the Hornburg itself, rather than at the top of the deep behind the Deeping Wall as in the book. Further, the Orcs assault the main gateway in a testudo, or locked- shields style formation, and the 'blasting fire' is depicted as gunpowder. The battle was filmed mainly at night, in frequent heavy natural rain or when necessary with artificial rain on the actors, for more than three months. The Helm's Deep set used some computer-generated imagery; some parts were constructed as full size sets; some shots used a 1/4 scale physical model, while more distant shots used a 1/85 scale model. In the final battle scene, Weta's \\"Massive\\" crowd simulation software and \\"Grunt\\" rendering software were used, with thousands of Orcs modelled using Alias/Wavefront's \\"Maya\\" software. It has been described as one of the greatest battle scenes in film, combining \\"technical mastery, sweeping spectacle and tonal balance\\". In the film, 30,000 Orcs lay siege to the fortress, defended by around 300 Rohirrim. Soon after, however, a large group of the Elves of Lothl√≥rien join the defences, sent by Elrond, at Galadriel's prompting. The defenders suffer heavy losses, but hold out until dawn, when Gandalf arrives with 2,000 riders led by √âomer, who turn the tide of the battle and rout Saruman's forces.\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Extended Edition)\\", Ch. 23; Aragorn states that √âomer is heading north with 2,000 riders. In the original script of the film, Elrond and Arwen had gone to see Galadriel in person, and it was Arwen who led the Elves to fight alongside the Rohan defenders. Jackson rejected Arwen's involvement, revising her character from a \\"warrior princess\\" to a role closer to that of the book, but kept the Elves in the battle.The Two Towers: Extended Edition, \\"From Book to Screen\\".

They are an American three-time Grammy Award‚Äìnominated troupe who express their history as black women through song, dance, and sign language. Originally a four-person ensemble, the group has expanded to five-part harmonies, with a sixth member acting as a sign-language interpreter. Although the members have changed over four decades, the group continues to sing and perform worldwide. Musical career Sweet Honey in the Rock was founded in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, who was teaching a vocal workshop with the Washington, D.C. Black Repertory Company. Reagon retired from the group in 2004. The name of the group was derived from a song, based on Psalm 81:16, which tells of a land so rich that when rocks were cracked open, honey flowed from them. Johnson has said that this first song in which four women blended their voices was so powerful, that there was no question what the name of the group should be. The ensemble's most powerful messages are proclaimed through an enormous catalog of songs addressing the world's woes. They are currently occupied with immigration injustices, congressional greed and lack of compassion for citizens, the environmental imbalance, racial issues and women's issues. Sweet Honey in the Rock has received several Grammy Award nominations, including one for their children's album, Still the Same Me which received the Silver Award from the National Association of Parenting Publications. They won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album for their version of Lead Belly's \\"Grey Goose\\" from the compilation album Folkways: A Vision Shared. Performing at the White House in September 2009 Their vocals appeared in a number of animated counting cartoons on the long- running PBS series Sesame Street, and the group was the subject of the 2005 documentary Sweet Honey in the Rock: Raise Your Voice. The group has ventured through 20 vocalists since its creation. Embarking on a new chapter in their musical journey, Sweet Honey In The Rock now includes four core vocalists‚ÄîLouise Robinson, Carol Maillard (both founding members) Nitanju Bolade Casel, and Aisha Kahlil‚Äîplus Shirley Childress (an American Sign Language Interpreter who had been performing live with the group since 1981 until her passing in 2017). Influences Sweet Honey in the Rock has been making music since the mid-1970s. Although the members of the group have changed over time, their music has consistently combined contemporary rhythms and narratives with a musical style rooted in the Gospel music, spirituals and hymns of the African-American Church. The ensemble composes much of their own music. They have addressed topics including motherhood, spirituality, freedom, civil rights, domestic violence, immigration issues, and racism. In their latest album, \\"#LoveinEvolution,\\" they address the additional topics of police shootings, specifically the Charleston church shooting, and the environment. Members Over the decades, more than 20 individuals have lent their voices to Sweet Honey in the Rock. Beginning as a quartet, the group is now composed of six African-American women (including a professional American Sign Language interpreter who accompanies the group on concert tours). =Current group members= *Nitanju Bolade Casel *Aisha Kahlil *Louise Robinson (an original ensemble member) *Carol Lynn Maillard (an original ensemble member) *Barbara Hunt (sign language interpreter) *Rochelle Rice *Christie Dashiell *Romeir Mendez (bassist) =Previous group members= Sweet Honey in the Rock in Concert, 2006. *Ysaye Maria Barnwell *Bernice Johnson Reagon (founder) *Shirley Childress Saxton (sign language interpreter) (B.1947-D.2017) *Arnae Batson *Mie *Dianaruthe Wharton *Evelyn Maria Harris *Rosie Lee Hooks *Ayodele Harrington *Ingrid Ellis *Tia Juana Starks *Patricia Johnson *Yasmeen Williams *Laura Sharp *Tulani Jordan Kinard *Helena Coleman *Geraldine Hardin *Akua Opokuwaa *Navasha Daya (special guest for \\"40 and Fierce Tour\\") \\"Are We a Nation?\\" On June 22, 2010, the group released the song \\"Are We a Nation?\\", their response to Arizona's controversial immigration law, SB-1070. An official music video of the song was released online on July 2, 2010. Directed by James Lester, the video was shot in New York City at Tainted Blue Recording Studio during a live recording session of the song. Amanda Navarro researched and provided the video's archival images and Russel Soder was the cinematographer. Ramon Hervey II served as the project's executive producer. The band donated a portion of the proceeds from the sales of \\"Are We a Nation?\\" to the Center for Community Change, an organization founded in 1968 to honor the life of Robert F. Kennedy.

The goal of GNU Chess is to serve as a basis for research. It has been used in numerous research contexts. GNU Chess is free software, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 or any later version, and is maintained by collaborating developers. As one of the earliest computer chess programs with full source code available, it is one of the oldest for Unix-based systems and has since been ported to many other platforms.  Features  As of 2 September 2017 GNU Chess 5.60 is rated at 2813 Elo points (when using one CPU) on CCRL's 40-moves-in-40-minutes list. For comparison, the strongest chess engine in the list using one CPU, Strelka 5.5, has an Elo rating of 3108 (the 295 ELO point difference indicates that Strelka 5.5 would beat GNU Chess 5.60 in about 85% of games). On the same list, Fritz 8 is rated at only 2701, and that program in the 2004 Man vs Machine World Team Championship beat grandmasters Sergey Karjakin, Veselin Topalov and reached a draw with Ruslan Ponomariov.

It was intended to decrypt messages transmitted by the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union (e.g. the NKVD, the KGB, and the GRU). Initiated when the Soviet Union was an ally of the US, the program continued during the Cold War, when it was considered an enemy. During the 37-year duration of the Venona project, the Signal Intelligence Service decrypted and translated approximately 3,000 messages.Benson 2001, p. 14 The signals intelligence yield included discovery of the Cambridge Five espionage ring in the United Kingdom and Soviet espionage of the Manhattan Project in the U.S. (known as project Enormous / –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è ¬´–≠–Ω–æ—Ä–º–æ–∑¬ª). Some of the espionage was undertaken to support the Soviet atomic bomb project. The Venona project remained secret for more than 15 years after it concluded. Some of the decoded Soviet messages were not declassified and published by the United States until 1995. Background During World War II and the early years of the Cold War, the Venona project was a source of information on Soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the Western military powers. Although unknown to the public, and even to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, these programs were of importance concerning crucial events of the early Cold War. These included the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spying case (which was based on events during World War II) and the defections of Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess to the Soviet Union. Most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945, during World War II, when the Soviet Union was an ally of the US. Sometime in 1945, the existence of the Venona program was revealed to the Soviet Union by cryptologist-analyst Bill Weisband, an NKVD agent in the U.S. Army's SIGINT. These messages were slowly and gradually decrypted beginning in 1946. This effort continued (many times at a low level of effort in the latter years) through 1980, when the Venona program was terminated. The analyst effort assigned to it was moved to more important projects. To what extent the various individuals referred to in the messages were involved with Soviet intelligence is a topic of historical dispute. While a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the Venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of Soviet intelligence agents,How VENONA was Declassified, Robert Louis Benson, Symposium of Cryptologic History; October 27, 2005.\\"Tangled Treason\\", Sam Tanenhaus, The New Republic, 1999. others argue that many of those people probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.\\"Tales from decrypts,\\" The Nation, 28 October 1996, pp. 5‚Äì6. =Commencement= Gene Grabeel, the first cryptanalyst of the Venona project The Venona Project was initiated on February 1, 1943, by Gene Grabeel, an American mathematician and cryptanalyst, under orders from Colonel Carter W. Clarke, Chief of Special Branch of the Military Intelligence Service at that time. Clarke distrusted Joseph Stalin, and feared that the Soviet Union would sign a separate peace with Nazi Germany, allowing Germany to focus its military forces against the United Kingdom and the United States. Cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army's Signal Intelligence Service at Arlington Hall analyzed encrypted high-level Soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after World War II by American, British, and Australian listening posts.Yuri Modin, My Five Cambridge Friends, 1994, Ballantine Books, , p. 194 Decryption This message traffic, which was encrypted with a one-time pad system, was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy by hundreds of cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s. When used correctly, the one-time pad encryption system, which has been used for all the most-secret military and diplomatic communication since the 1930s, is unbreakable. However, due to a serious blunder on the part of the Soviets, some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers, as a result of pressures brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication‚Äîwhich undermines the security of a one-time system‚Äîwas discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users.Cryptologic Almanac 50th Anniversary Series -- VENONA: An Overview (DOCID: 3575728) . Released by NSA on 06-12-2009, FOIA Case # 52567. Despite this, the reuse was detected by cryptanalysts in the US. =Breakthrough= Genevieve Feinstein The Soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers, to which additive keys (from one-time pads) were added, encrypting the content. When used correctly so that the plaintext is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key, one-time pad encryption is unbreakable. However, cryptanalysis by American code-breakers revealed that some of the one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the Soviets (specifically, entire pages, although not complete books), which allowed decryption (sometimes only partial) of a small part of the traffic. Generating the one-time pads was a slow and labor-intensive process, and the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941 caused a sudden increase in the need for coded messages. It is probable that the Soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand. It was Arlington Hall's Lieutenant Richard Hallock, working on Soviet \\"Trade\\" traffic (so called because these messages dealt with Soviet trade issues), who first discovered that the Soviets were reusing pages. Hallock and his colleagues, amongst whom were Genevieve Feinstein, Cecil Phillips, Frank Lewis, Frank Wanat, and Lucille Campbell, went on to break into a significant amount of Trade traffic, recovering many one-time pad additive key tables in the process. Meredith Gardner (far left); most of the other code breakers were young women. A young Meredith Gardner then used this material to break into what turned out to be NKVD (and later GRU) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers. Gardner credits Marie Meyer, a linguist with the Signal Intelligence Service with making some of the initial recoveries of the Venona codebook. Samuel Chew and Cecil Phillips also made valuable contributions. On 20 December 1946, Gardner made the first break into the code, revealing the existence of Soviet espionage in the Manhattan Project. Venona messages also indicated that Soviet spies worked in Washington in the State Department, Treasury, Office of Strategic Services, and even the White House. Very slowly, using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to defector information, more of the messages were decrypted. Claims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books (a partially burned one was obtained by the Finns) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices (analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext. These latter claims are less than fully supported in the open literature. One significant aid (mentioned by the NSA) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the Japanese and Finnish cryptanalysis organizations; when the Americans broke into Japanese codes during World War II, they gained access to this information. There are also reports that copies of signals purloined from Soviet offices by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were helpful in the cryptanalysis. The Finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning Soviet codes to OSS in 1944 during Operation Stella Polaris, including the partially burned code book. =Results= NSA reported that (according to the serial numbers of the Venona cables) thousands of cables were sent, but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts. Approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated; about half of the 1943 GRU-Naval Washington to Moscow messages were broken, but none for any other year, although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945. The decryption rate of the NKVD cables was as follows: * 1942 1.8% * 1943 15.0% * 1944 49.0% * 1945 1.5% Out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts, it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted. All the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942, and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945, with a few being used as late as 1948. After this, Soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable. The existence of Venona decryption became known to the Soviets within a few years of the first breaks. It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence Service representative to the U.S. Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption. =Significance= The decrypted messages gave important insights into Soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used. With the first break into the code, Venona revealed the existence of Soviet espionage \\"these intercepts provided ... descriptions of the activities of precisely the same Soviet spies who were named by defecting Soviet agents Alexander Orlov, Walter Krivitsky, Whittaker Chambers, and Elizabeth Bentley.\\" at Los Alamos National Laboratories. \\"Thanks to successful espionage, the Russians tested their first atom bomb in August 1949, just four years after the first American test. As will be discussed, we had learned of the Los Alamos spies in December 1946‚ÄîDecember 20, to be precise. The US Army Security Agency, in the person of Meredith Knox Gardner, a genius in his own right, had broken one of what it termed the Venona messages‚Äîthe transmissions that Soviet agents in the United States sent to and received from Moscow.\\" Identities soon emerged of American, Canadian, Australian, and British spies in service to the Soviet government, including Klaus Fuchs, Alan Nunn May, and Donald Maclean. Others worked in Washington in the State Department, the Treasury, Office of Strategic Services, \\"KGB cables indicated that the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in World War II had been thoroughly infiltrated with Soviet agents.\\" and even the White House. The messages show that the U.S. and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the Soviet Union as early as 1942. Among those identified are Julius and Ethel Rosenberg; Alger Hiss; Harry Dexter White, the second-highest official in the Treasury Department; Lauchlin Currie, \\"Currie, known as PAZh (Page) and White, whose cover names were YuRIST (Jurist) and changed later to LAJER (Lawyer), had been Soviet agents since the 1930s. They had been identified as Soviet agents in Venona translations and by other agents turned witnesses or informants for the FBI and Justice Department. From the Venona translations, both were known to pass intelligence to their handlers, notably the Silvermaster network.\\" a personal aide to Franklin Roosevelt; and Maurice Halperin, a section head in the Office of Strategic Services. The identification of individuals mentioned in Venona transcripts is sometimes problematic, since people with a \\"covert relationship\\" with Soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms. Further complicating matters is the fact the same person sometimes had different cryptonyms at different times, and the same cryptonym was sometimes reused for different individuals. In some cases, notably Hiss, the matching of a Venona cryptonym to an individual is disputed. In many other cases, a Venona cryptonym has not yet been linked to any person. According to authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, the Venona transcripts identify approximately 349 Americans who they claim had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence, though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities. However, not every agent may have been communicating directly with Soviet intelligence. Each of those 349 persons may have had many others working for, and reporting only to, them. The Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the CIA, housed at one time or another between fifteen and twenty Soviet spies. Duncan Lee, Donald Wheeler, Jane Foster Zlatowski, and Maurice Halperin passed information to Moscow. The War Production Board, the Board of Economic Warfare, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the Office of War Information, included at least half a dozen Soviet sources each among their employees. Bearing of Venona on particular cases Venona has added information‚Äîsome unequivocal, some ambiguous‚Äîto several espionage cases. Some known spies, including Theodore Hall, were neither prosecuted nor publicly implicated, because the Venona evidence against them was withheld. = 19 = The identity of Soviet source cryptonymed \\"19\\" remains unclear. According to British writer Nigel West, \\"19\\" was president of Czechoslovak government-in-exile Edvard Bene≈°.Nigel West, Venona, najwiƒôksza tajemnica zimnej wojny, Warszawa 2006, p.138. Military historian Eduard Mark Eduard Mark. \\"Venona's Source 19 and the Trident Conference of May 1943: Diplomacy or Espionage?\\". Intelligence and National Security. London, Summer 1998, pp. 1‚Äì31 and American authors Herbert Romerstein and Eric Breindel concluded it was Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins. According to American authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, \\"19\\" could be someone from the British delegation to the Washington Conference in May 1943. Moreover, they argue no evidence of Hopkins as an agent has been found in other archives, and the partial message relating to \\"19\\" does not indicate if this source was a spy. However, Vasili Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist who defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 with copies of large numbers of KGB files. He claimed Harry Hopkins was a secret Russian agent.The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB, by Vasily Mitrokhin and Christopher Andrew. Moreover, Oleg Gordievsky, a high-level KGB officer who also defected from the Soviet Union, reported that Iskhak Akhmerov, the KGB officer who controlled the clandestine Soviet agents in the U.S. during the war, had said Hopkins was \\"the most important of all Soviet wartime agents in the United States\\".KGB: The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev, by Oleg Gordievsky and Christopher Andrew. Alexander Vassiliev's notes identified source code-named \\"19\\" as Laurence Duggan. =Julius and Ethel Rosenberg= Venona has added significant information to the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, making it clear Julius was guilty of espionage, and also showing that Ethel, while not acting as a principal, still acted as an accessory, had full knowledge of Julius's espionage activity and played the main role in the recruitment of her brother for atomic espionage. Venona and other recent information has shown, while the content of Julius' atomic espionage was not as vital to the Soviets as alleged at the time of his espionage activities, in other fields it was extensive. The information Rosenberg passed to the Soviets concerned the proximity fuze, design and production information on the Lockheed P-80 jet fighter, and thousands of classified reports from Emerson Radio. The Venona evidence indicates unidentified sources code-named \\"Quantum\\" and \\"Pers\\" who facilitated transfer of nuclear weapons technology to the Soviet Union from positions within the Manhattan Project. According to Alexander Vassiliev's notes from KGB archive, \\"Quantum\\" was Boris Podolsky and \\"Pers\\" was Russell W. McNutt, an engineer from the uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge.Vassiliev-Notebooks- and-Venona-Index-Concordance.pdf, ed. 2013, pp: 325, 343 =Klaus Fuchs= The Venona decryptions were also important in the exposure of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. Some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the Manhattan Project, who was referred to by the code names of CHARLES and REST. One such message from Moscow to New York, dated April 10, 1945, called information provided by CHARLES \\"of great value.\\" Noting that the information included \\"data on the atomic mass of the nuclear explosive\\" and \\"details on the explosive method of actuating\\" the atomic bomb, the message requested further technical details from CHARLES.NSA, 2013 Investigations based on the Venona decryptions eventually identified CHARLES and REST as Fuchs in 1949. =Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White= According to the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, the complicity of both Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White is conclusively proven by Venona,\\"Report Of The Commission On Protecting And Reducing Government Secrecy\\" stating \\"The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department.\\" In his 1998 book, United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan expressed certainty about Hiss's identification by Venona as a Soviet spy, writing \\"Hiss was indeed a Soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by Moscow as its most important.\\" Several current authors, researchers, and archivists consider the Venona evidence on Hiss to be inconclusive. See, for example: , , =Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess= Kim Philby had access to CIA and FBI files, and more damaging, access to Venona Project briefings. When Philby learned of Venona in 1949, he obtained advance warning that his fellow Soviet spy Donald Maclean was in danger of being exposed. The FBI told Philby about an agent cryptonymed \\"Homer\\", whose 1945 message to Moscow had been decoded. As it had been sent from New York and had its origins in the British Embassy in Washington, Philby, who would not have known Maclean's cryptonym, deduced the sender's identity. By early 1951, Philby knew U.S. intelligence would soon also conclude Maclean was the sender, and advised Moscow to extract Maclean. This led to Maclean and Guy Burgess' flight in May 1951 to Moscow, where they lived the remainder of their lives.Yuri Modin, My Five Cambridge Friends, 1994, Ballantine, p. 190‚Äì199 =Soviet espionage in Australia= In addition to British and American operatives, Australians collected Venona intercepts at a remote base in the Outback. The Soviets remained unaware of this base as late as 1950.Yuri Modin, My Five Cambridge Friends, 1994, Ballantine, p. 191 The founding of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) by Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley in 1949 was considered highly controversial within Chifley's own party. Until then, the left-leaning Australian Labor Party had been hostile to domestic intelligence agencies on civil-liberties grounds and a Labor government founding one seemed a surprising about-face. But the presentation of Venona material to Chifley, revealing evidence of Soviet agents operating in Australia, brought this about. As well as Australian diplomat suspects abroad, Venona had revealed Walter Seddon Clayton (cryptonym \\"KLOD\\"), a leading official within the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), as the chief organiser of Soviet intelligence gathering in Australia.Andrew, Christopher. \\"The Defence of the Realm. The Authorised History of MI5\\", 2008. , p. 371 Investigation revealed that Clayton formed an underground network within the CPA so that the party could continue to operate if it were banned. In 1950, George Ronald Richards was appointed ASIO's deputy-director of operations for Venona, based in Sydney, charged with investigating intelligence uncovered the eleven Australians identified in the cables that were decoded. He continued Venona-related work in London with MI5 from November 1952 and went on to lead Operation Cabin 12, the high-profile 1953‚Äì1954 defection to Australia of Soviet spy Vladimir Petrov. Public disclosure For much of its history, knowledge of Venona was restricted even from the highest levels of government. Senior army officers, in consultation with the FBI and CIA, made the decision to restrict knowledge of Venona within the government (even the CIA was not made an active partner until 1952). Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley, concerned about the White House's history of leaking sensitive information, decided to deny President Truman direct knowledge of the project. The president received the substance of the material only through FBI, Justice Department, and CIA reports on counterintelligence and intelligence matters. He was not told the material came from decoded Soviet ciphers. To some degree this secrecy was counter-productive; Truman was distrustful of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover and suspected the reports were exaggerated for political purposes. Some of the earliest detailed public knowledge that Soviet code messages from World War II had been broken came with the release of Chapman Pincher's book, Too Secret Too Long, in 1984. Robert Lamphere's book, The FBI-KGB War, was released in 1986. Lamphere had been the FBI liaison to the code-breaking activity, had considerable knowledge of Venona and the counter-intelligence work that resulted from it. However, the first detailed account of the Venona project, identifying it by name and making clear its long-term implications in post-war espionage, was contained in MI5 assistant director Peter Wright's 1987 memoir, Spycatcher. Many inside the NSA had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the Venona project, but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan Commission on Government Secrecy, with Senator Moynihan as chairman, released Venona project materials. Moynihan wrote: > \\"[The] secrecy system has systematically denied American historians access > to the records of American history. Of late we find ourselves relying on > archives of the former Soviet Union in Moscow to resolve questions of what > was going on in Washington at mid-century. ... the Venona intercepts > contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in > America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds.\\" One of the considerations in releasing Venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names were not released because to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy. However, in at least one case, independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the NSA. The dearth of reliable information available to the public‚Äîor even to the President and Congress‚Äîmay have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of Soviet espionage in the United States. Anti- Communists suspected many spies remained at large, perhaps including some known to the government. Those who criticized the governmental and non- governmental efforts to root out and expose communists felt these efforts were an overreaction (in addition to other reservations about McCarthyism). Public access‚Äîor broader governmental access‚Äîto the Venona evidence would certainly have affected this debate, as it is affecting the retrospective debate among historians and others now. As the Moynihan Commission wrote in its final report: > \\"A balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear; the Venona > messages will surely supply a great cache of facts to bring the matter to > some closure. But at the time, the American Government, much less the > American public, was confronted with possibilities and charges, at once > baffling and terrifying.\\" The National Cryptologic Museum features an exhibit on the Venona project in its \\"Cold War/Information Age\\" gallery. Texas textbook controversy Controversy arose in 2009 over the Texas State Board of Education's revision of their high school history class curricula to suggest Venona shows Senator Joseph McCarthy to have been justified in his zeal in exposing those whom he believed to be Soviet spies or communist sympathizers. Critics such as Emory University history professor Harvey Klehr assert most people and organizations identified by McCarthy, such as those brought forward in the Army-McCarthy hearings or rival politicians in the Democratic party, were not mentioned in the Venona content and that his accusations remain largely unsupported by evidence. Critical views The majority of historians are convinced of the historical value of the Venona material. Intelligence historian Nigel West believes that \\"Venona remain[s] an irrefutable resource, far more reliable than the mercurial recollections of KGB defectors and the dubious conclusions drawn by paranoid analysts mesmerized by Machiavellian plots.\\" However, a number of writers and scholars have taken a critical view of the translations. They question the accuracy of the translations and the identifications of covernames that the NSA translations give. Writers Walter and Miriam Schneir, in a lengthy 1999 review of one of the first book-length studies of the messages, object to what they see as the book's overconfidence in the translations' accuracy, noting that the undecrypted gaps in the texts can make interpretation difficult, and emphasizing the problem of identifying the individuals mentioned under covernames. To support their critique, they cite a declassified memorandum, written in 1956 by A. H. Belmont, who was assistant to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover at the time.The memo is now available on line at In the memo, Belmont discusses the possibility of using the Venona translations in court to prosecute Soviet agents, and comes out strongly opposed to their use. His reasons include legal uncertainties about the admissibility of the translations as evidence, and the difficulties that prosecution would face in supporting the validity of the translations. Belmont highlights the uncertainties in the translation process, noting that the cryptographers have indicated that \\"almost anything included in a translation of one of these deciphered messages may in the future be radically revised.\\" He also notes the complexities of identifying people with covernames, describing how the personal details mentioned for covername \\"Antenna\\" fit more than one person, and the investigative process required to finally connect \\"Antenna\\" to Julius Rosenberg. The Schneirs conclude that \\"A reader faced with Venona's incomplete, disjointed messages can easily arrive at a badly skewed impression.\\" Many of the critiques of the Venona translations have been based on specific cases. The Schneirs' critique of the Venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Another critique of the Venona translations came from the late Rutgers University law professor John Lowenthal, who as a law student worked as a volunteer for Alger Hiss's defense team, and later wrote extensively on the Hiss case.For Lowenthal's work on the Hiss case see the Alger Hiss Story website, hosted at NYU. Lowenthal's critique focused on one message (Venona 1822 KGB Washington- Moscow 30 March 1945),Available at the NSA's Venona website. in which the comments identified the covername 'Ales' as \\"probably Alger Hiss.\\" Lowenthal raised a number of objections to this identification, rejecting it as \\"a conclusion psychologically motivated and politically correct but factually wrong.\\" Lowenthal's article led to an extended debate on the 'Ales' message,The first response to Lowenthal was Following this there was an extended discussion on h-net diplo list and the h-net list for the history of American communism. For a summary of a draft response from Lowenthal (he died in 2003) see Another response following this was This gave rise to a conference paper: (archived version) and finally a response from Mark again (he died in 2009): and even prompted the NSA to declassify the original Russian text.See (archived version). Currently Venona 1822 is the only message for which the complete decrypted Russian text has been published. Victor Navasky, editor and publisher of The Nation, has also written several editorials highly critical of John Earl Haynes' and Harvey Klehr's interpretation of recent work on the subject of Soviet espionage. Navasky claims the Venona material is being used to \\"distort ... our understanding of the cold war\\" and that the files are potential \\"time bombs of misinformation.\\" Commenting on the list of 349 Americans identified by Venona, published in an appendix to Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America, Navasky wrote, \\"The reader is left with the implication‚Äîunfair and unproven‚Äîthat every name on the list was involved in espionage, and as a result, otherwise careful historians and mainstream journalists now routinely refer to Venona as proof that many hundreds of Americans were part of the red spy network.\\" Navasky goes further in his defense of the listed people and has claimed a great deal of the so- called espionage that went on was nothing more than \\"exchanges of information among people of good will\\" and that \\"most of these exchanges were innocent and were within the law.\\" According to historian Ellen Schrecker, \\"Because they offer insights into the world of the secret police on both sides of the Iron Curtain, it is tempting to treat the FBI and Venona materials less critically than documents from more accessible sources. But there are too many gaps in the record to use these materials with complete confidence.\\" Schrecker believes the documents established the guilt of many prominent figures, but is still critical of the views of scholars such as John Earl Haynes, arguing, \\"complexity, nuance, and a willingness to see the world in other than black and white seem alien to Haynes' view of history.\\" See also *Elizabeth Bentley *History of Soviet and Russian espionage in the United States *List of Americans in the Venona papers *List of Soviet agents in the United States Notes References and further reading =Books=     =Online sources= * **Venona PDFs, arranged by date (NSA)   \\"Secrets, Lies, and Atomic Spies\\", PBS Transcript, Airdate: February 5, 2002 External links *Venona Documents - National Security Agency Cold War espionage Cold War intelligence operations Espionage projects History of cryptography National Security Agency Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited States relations Spy rings ","title":"Venona project"},{"id":"173627","text":"Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair (1 May 1818 ‚Äì 29 May 1898) was a British scientist and Liberal politician. Early life Playfair was born at Chunar, Bengal, the son of George Playfair (1782-1846), Inspector General of Hospitals in that region, and Janet Ross (1795-1862), daughter of John Ross. The family was fairly middle class with strong academic roots in University of St Andrews (his grandfather being Rev Prof James Playfair). All of Playfair's siblings were sent back to Scotland to avoid the hazards of an Indian upbringing. Playfair was named after his uncle, Sir Hugh Lyon Playfair, and was educated at the University of St Andrews, the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow, and the University of Edinburgh. After going to Calcutta at the end of 1837, he became private laboratory assistant to Thomas Graham at University College, London, and in 1839 went to work under Justus Liebig at the University of Giessen. Early career After returning to Britain, Playfair became manager of a calico works in Primrose, near Clitheroe, and in 1843 was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Manchester Institution, where he was assisted by Robert Angus Smith. Two years later, he was made chemist to the Geological Survey, and subsequently became Professor in the new School of Mines. In 1848, he was elected to the Royal Society, and three years later was made Special Commissioner and a member of the executive committee of the Great Exhibition. After the Exhibition, the Society of Arts organised a series of lectures to draw attention to the lessons which should be learned from the Exhibition. Playfair's two lectures were devoted to technical education, which he considered in Britain to be unfit for an increasingly competitive world.Wemyss Reid, Memoirs and Correspondence of Lyon Playfair (London: Cassell, 1900), pp. 148‚Äì149. In preparation for his lectures, Playfair toured France, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Scandinavia to study their education systems. His first lecture was delivered to the School of Mines, under the title \\"Industrial Instruction on the Continent\\", and was published in the Records of the School of Mines. It aroused great public interest and Playfair later claimed that it gave a considerable impulse to technical education in Britain, with the government establishing the Department of Science and Art soon afterwards.Reid, pp. 149‚Äì150. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, Playfair also became Gentleman Usher to Prince Albert, and in 1853 was appointed Secretary of the Department of Science, in which capacity he advocated the use of poison gas against the Russians in the Crimean War. In 1855, he was a commissioner of the Exposition Universelle, and two years later became President of the Chemical Society, finally returning to Edinburgh University in 1858 as Professor of Chemistry there. In 1859 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being James David Forbes. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1864 to 1870. Political career In 1868, Playfair was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, being sworn of the Privy Council and made Postmaster General in Gladstone's government in 1873. The Liberals lost power in early 1874 but on their return to office in 1880, Playfair was appointed Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, holding these posts until 1883, when he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He was subsequently President of the British Association in 1885. In February 1886 he returned to the government as Vice-President of the Committee on Education under Gladstone, a post he held until the government fell in July of the same year. He was made a member of the Council of the Duchy of Cornwall in 1889. In November 1887, a meeting of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations held in Oxford passed a resolution calling for Fair Trade (a form of protectionism).'Conservative Conference at Oxford', The Times (23 November 1887), p. 8. The following month, Playfair defended free trade in a speech in Leeds, which was published by the Cobden Club under the title \\"On Fair Trade and the Depression in Agriculture\\". He later claimed that this pamphlet sold around 100,000 copies.Reid, p. 367. The veteran free trade campaigner, John Bright, wrote to Playfair and said his speech was \\"one of the best, if not the best, spoken on the question\\".Reid, p. 368. Playfair delivered a speech to the City Liberal Club in London, where he claimed that economic depressions were not due to fiscal arrangements but were universal and synchronous in all industrialised nations. The advancements in science, such as improved transport and the substitution of machine for manual labour, had lowered the value of labour of quantity and heightened the value of labour of quality. This, Playfair claimed, had dislocated labour.Reid, p. 368. Playfair enlarged on this speech in an article for The Contemporary Review of March 1888.Reid, pp. 368‚Äì369. Afterwards, Playfair delivered a speech to the National Liberal Club, which was published as \\"On Industrial Competition and Commercial Freedom\\" by the Cobden Club. The Liberal Party leader, William Ewart Gladstone, wrote to Playfair to thank him for his \\"admirable tract; so comprehensive, clear, simple in statement, rich in illustration\\".Reid, p. 369. Having represented Leeds South since 1885, Playfair left the House of Commons in 1892 and was ennobled as Baron Playfair, of St Andrews in the County of Fife. He served as a Lord in Waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) under Gladstone and then Lord Rosebery between 1892 and 1895. He was further honoured when he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1895 and awarded the Harben Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of Public Health in 1897. Playfair is also remembered for promoting a new cipher system invented by Charles Wheatstone, now known as the Playfair cipher. Later life The grave of Lyon Playfair, East Cemetery, St Andrews Lord Playfair died at his home at Onslow Gardens in South Kensington, London, in May 1898, aged 80. His body was returned to Scotland, where he was buried in the Eastern Cemetery, St Andrews, towards the north-east corner. He was succeeded in the barony by his son from his first marriage, George James Playfair (1849-1939) who is buried with him. A memorial fountain was erected to Playfair in St Andrews in 1899, to a design by Robert Lorimer.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer The main library at Imperial College in London was originally known as the Lyon Playfair Library in his honour, although now it is simply known as Central Library. Family Edith, Lady Playfair (n√©e Russell), John Singer Sargent, 1884 His brother William Smoult Playfair was a well known obstetrician, and brother Sir Lambert Playfair was a soldier and diplomat. Playfair married three times. He firstly married Margaret Eliza Oakes, daughter of James Oakes, in 1846. After her death in August 1855 he married Jean Ann Millington, daughter of Crawley Millington, in 1857. There were children from both marriages. Jean Ann died in 1877 and is buried in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh facing the section known as \\"Lords Row\\". After her death, he married Edith Russell of Boston, whose 1884 portrait is in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

He may have been killed when Babylon fell to the Persians in 539 BCE. Belshazzar also appears as a central character in the story of Belshazzar's feast in the Book of Daniel, recognized by scholars as a work of historical fiction. Daniel's Belshazzar is not malevolent (he rewards Daniel for his interpretation of the writing), but in later Jewish tradition he is presented as a tyrant who oppresses the Jewish people. In history The most important sources for the time of Belshazzar are the Nabonidus Chronicle, the Cyrus Cylinder, and the Verse Account of Nabonidus--which, despite its name, was commissioned by the Persian conqueror Cyrus the Great. Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The Nabonidus Chronicle describes him as a grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, but this may have been propaganda to justify the reign of his father, who was not of the royal line. He played a pivotal role in the coup d'etat that overthrew King Labashi-Marduk and brought Nabonidus to power in 556 BCE, although unlike his co-conspirators he was not a member of the old Babylonian aristocracy. Nabonidus spent the years c. 553‚Äì543 BCE in the oasis of Teima in the northern areas of the Arabian Peninsula, leaving Belshazzar to govern Babylon. During his father's prolonged absence Belshazzar ruled as regent or co-regent, but was never called King and never took part in the Babylonian New Year Festival, at which the king's presence was essential. His duties as Crown Prince (the title that appears in documents) included overseeing temple estates and leasing out temple land, and he worked at restoring the Babylonian god Marduk, demoted by Nabonidus in favor of the moon god Sin. Nabonidus returned to Babylon about 543 BCE, and the status of Belshazzar thereafter is unclear. The king's return may have been connected with the increasing threat posed by the Persian conqueror Cyrus the Great, who ruled a huge empire to the north and east of Babylon. Open hostilities commenced in late 539 BCE, and on 12 October \\"Ugbaru, governor of the district of Gutium, and the army of Cyrus entered Babylon without a battle\\" (Babylonian Chronicle)--this is presumably the same individual as Gobryas, a Babylonian provincial governor who switched to the Persian side, mentioned by the Greek historian Xenophon. Nabonidus was captured and his life apparently spared, but Belshazzar may have died during the fall of the city. In the Book of Daniel In the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar plays a significant role in the tale of Belshazzar's feast, a variation on the story of Nebuchadnezzar's madness showing what happens when a gentile king does not repent. During a feast, Babylonians eat and drink from the holy vessels of Yahweh's temple, and \\"king\\" Belshazzar sees handwriting the words mene, mene, tekel, upharsin on a wall. Daniel interprets the writing as a judgment from Yahweh, the god of Israel, foretelling the fall of Babylon. Daniel tells Belshazzar that because he has not given honor to God, his kingdom will be given to the Medes and Persians. Belshazzar is killed that night, and Darius the Mede takes the kingdom. The Book of Daniel was compiled shortly after 164 BCE, following the Maccabean Revolt. The story of Belshazzar's feast is historical fiction, and several details are not consistent with historical facts. Belshazzar is portrayed as the king of Babylon and \\"son\\" of Nebuchadnezzar, though he was actually the son of Nabonidus--one of Nebuchadnezzar's successors--and he never became king in his own right, nor did he lead the religious festivals as the king was required to do. In the story, the conqueror who inherits Babylon is Darius the Mede, but no such individual is known to history, and the invaders were actually Persians. This is typical of the \\"tale of court contest\\" in which historical accuracy is not an essential element. In later Jewish tradition In the Book of Daniel, Belshazzar is not malevolent (he rewards Daniel and raises him to high office). The later authors of the Talmud and the Midrash emphasize the tyrannous oppression of his Jewish subjects, with several passages in the Prophets interpreted as referring to him and his predecessors. For example, in the passage, \\"As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him\\" (Amos ), the lion is said to represent Nebuchadnezzar, and the bear, equally ferocious if not equally courageous, is Belshazzar. The Babylonian kings are often mentioned together as forming a succession of impious and tyrannical monarchs who oppressed Israel and were therefore foredoomed to disgrace and destruction. Isaiah , \\"And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant and son and grandchild, saith the Lord\\", is applied to the trio: \\"Name\\" to Nebuchadnezzar, \\"remnant\\" to Amel-Marduk, \\"son\\" to Belshazzar, and \\"grandchild\\" Vashti (ib.). The command given to Abraham to cut in pieces three heifers () as a part of the covenant established between him and his God was thus elucidated as symbolizing Babylonia, which gave rise to three kings, Nebuchadnezzar, Amel-Marduk, and Belshazzar, whose doom is prefigured by this act of \\"cutting to pieces\\" (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xliv.). The Midrash literature enters into the details of Belshazzar's death. Thus the later tradition states that Cyrus and Darius were employed as doorkeepers of the royal palace. Belshazzar, being greatly alarmed at the mysterious handwriting on the wall, and apprehending that someone in disguise might enter the palace with murderous intent, ordered his doorkeepers to behead anyone who attempted to force an entrance that night, even though such person should claim to be the king himself. Belshazzar, overcome by sickness, left the palace unobserved during the night through a rear exit. On his return, the doorkeepers refused to admit him. In vain did he plead that he was the king. They said, \\"Has not the king ordered us to put to death anyone who attempts to enter the palace, though he claims to be the king himself?\\" Suiting the action to the word, Cyrus and Darius grasped a heavy ornament forming part of a candelabrum, and with it shattered the skull of their royal master (Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 3:4).

This includes forced labor, reducing a person to a servile status (including forced marriage) and sex trafficking persons, such as the sexual trafficking of children. Sexual slavery may also involve single-owner sexual slavery; ritual slavery, sometimes associated with certain religious practices, such as ritual servitude in Ghana, Togo and Benin; slavery for primarily non-sexual purposes but where non-consensual sexual activity is common; or forced prostitution. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action calls for an international effort to make people aware of sexual slavery, and that sexual slavery is an abuse of human rights. The incidence of sexual slavery by country has been studied and tabulated by UNESCO, with the cooperation of various international agencies. UNESCO Trafficking Project . unescobkk.org. Definitions The Rome Statute (1998) (which defines the crimes over which the International Criminal Court may have jurisdiction) encompasses crimes against humanity (Article 7) which include \\"enslavement\\" (Article 7.1.c) and \\"sexual enslavement\\" (Article 7.1.g) \\"when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\\". It also defines sexual enslavement as a war crime and a breach of the Geneva Conventions when committed during an international armed conflict (Article 8.b.xxii) and indirectly in an internal armed conflict under Article(8.c.ii), but the courts jurisdiction over war crimes is explicitly excluded from including crimes committed during \\"situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature\\" (Article 8.d). The text of the Rome Statute does not explicitly define sexual enslavement, but does define enslavement as \\"the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person and includes the exercise of such power in the course of trafficking in persons, in particular women and children\\" (Article 7.2.c).However the elements of the crime of sexual enslavement are described in more detail in a separate document originating from Article 9 of the Rome Statute: \\"General introduction 1. Pursuant to article 9 [of the Rome Statute], the following Elements of Crimes shall assist the Court in the interpretation and application of articles 6, 7 and 8, consistent with the Statute\\" (Article 1 of the Elements of the Crime). They are found in a paragraphs entitled \\"Article 7 (1) (g)-2 Crime against humanity of sexual slavery\\"; \\"Article 8 (2) (b) (xxii)-2 War crime of sexual slavery\\"; and \\"Article 8 (2) (e) (vi)-2 War crime of sexual slavery\\". The same wording is used in all three paragraphs () In the commentary on the Rome Statute,Commentaries on treaties explain why certain words and phrases appeared in a treaty and what the delegates considered when agreeing to the words and phrases used. Mark Klamberg states: Type =Commercial sexual exploitation of adults= Commercial sexual exploitation of adults (often referred to as \\"sex trafficking\\") is a type of human trafficking involving the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people, by coercive or abusive means for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Commercial sexual exploitation is not the only form of human trafficking and estimates vary as to the percentage of human trafficking which is for the purpose of transporting someone into sexual slavery. The BBC News cited a report by UNODC as listing the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking in 2007 as Thailand, Japan, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the US. The report lists Thailand, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine as major sources of trafficked persons. =Commercial sexual exploitation of children= Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) includes child prostitution (or child sex trafficking), child sex tourism, child pornography, or other forms of transactional sex with children. The Youth Advocate Program International (YAPI) describes CSEC as a form of coercion and violence against children and a contemporary form of slavery. A declaration of the World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Stockholm in 1996, defined CSEC as, \\"sexual abuse by the adult and remuneration in cash or in kind to the child or to a third person or persons. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object\\". Child prostitution Child prostitution, or child sex trafficking, is a form of sexual slavery. It is the commercial sexual exploitation of children, in which a child performs the services of prostitution, usually for the financial benefit of an adult. India's federal police said in 2009 that they believed around 1.2 million children in India to be involved in prostitution. A CBI statement said that studies and surveys sponsored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development estimated about 40% of India's prostitutes to be children. Thailand's Health System Research Institute reported that children in prostitution make up 40% of prostitutes in Thailand. In some parts of the world, child prostitution is tolerated or ignored by the authorities. Reflecting an attitude which prevails in many developing countries, a judge from Honduras said, on condition of anonymity: \\"If the victim [the child prostitute] is older than 12, if he or she refuses to file a complaint and if the parents clearly profit from their child's commerce, we tend to look the other way\\". Child sex tourism Child sex tourism is a form child sex trafficking, and is mainly centered on buying and selling children into sexual slavery. It is when an adult travels to a foreign country for the purpose of engaging in commercially facilitated child sexual abuse. Child sex tourism results in both mental and physical consequences for the exploited children, that may include \\"disease (including HIV/AIDS), drug addiction, pregnancy, malnutrition, social ostracism, and possibly death\\", according to the State Department of the United States. Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation. Child pornography Child pornography, sometimes referred to as 'child abuse images', refers to images or films depicting sexually explicit activities involving a child. As such, child pornography is often a visual record of child sexual abuse. Abuse of the child occurs during the sexual acts which are photographed in the production of child pornography, and the effects of the abuse on the child (and continuing into maturity) are compounded by the wide distribution and lasting availability of the photographs of the abuse. Child sex trafficking often involves child pornography. Children are commonly purchased and sold for sexual purposes without the parents knowing. In these cases, children are often used to produce child pornography, especially sadistic forms of child pornography where they may be tortured. =Cybersex trafficking= Victims of cybersex trafficking, primarily women and children, are sex slaves who are trafficked and then forced to perform in live streaming pp. 1‚Äì4. shows involving coerced sex acts or rape on webcam. p. 64. They are usually made to watch the paying consumers on shared screens and follow their orders. It occurs in 'cybersex dens,‚Äô which are rooms equipped with webcams. =Forced prostitution= Most, if not all, forms of forced prostitution may be viewed as a kind of sexual slavery. The terms \\"forced prostitution\\" and \\"enforced prostitution\\" appear in international and humanitarian conventions but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied. \\"Forced prostitution\\" generally refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity. The issue of consent in prostitution is hotly debated. Opinion in places such as Europe has been divided over the question of whether prostitution should be considered as a free choice or as inherently exploitative of women. The law in Sweden, Norway and Iceland ‚Äì where it is illegal to pay for sex, but not to sell sexual services ‚Äì is based on the notion that all forms of prostitution are inherently exploitative, opposing the notion that prostitution can be voluntary. In contrast, prostitution is a recognized profession in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany. In 1949 the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others (the 1949 Convention). The 1949 Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of forced prostitution. Signatories are charged with three obligations under the 1949 Convention: prohibition of trafficking, specific administrative and enforcement measures, and social measures aimed at trafficked persons. The 1949 Convention presents two shifts in perspective of the trafficking problem in that it views prostitutes as victims of the procurers, and in that it eschews the terms \\"white slave traffic\\" and \\"women,\\" using for the first time race- and gender-neutral language.Kathryn E. Nelson (2002) Sex trafficking and forced prostitution: comprehensive new legal approaches. Houston Journal of International Law Article 1 of the 1949 Convention provides punishment for any person who \\"[p]rocures, entices or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person\\" or \\"[e]xploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person.\\" To fall under the provisions of the 1949 Convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines. =Forced marriage= A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married, without their freely given consent. Ethics ‚Äì Forced Marriages: Introduction . BBC. Forced marriage is a form of sexual slavery. Causes for forced marriages include customs such as bride price and dowry; poverty; the importance given to female premarital virginity; \\"family honor\\"; the fact that marriage is considered in certain communities a social arrangement between the extended families of the bride and groom; limited education and economic options; perceived protection of cultural or religious traditions; assisting immigration.Reasons for forced marriage ‚Äì Analysis of Data Collected from Field Workers ‚Äì Report on the Practice of Forced Marriage in Canada: Interviews with Frontline Workers: Exploratory Research Conducted in Montreal and Toronto in 2008.

As quoted by Guy Horton in Dying Alive ‚Äì A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co- Operation. See section \\"12.52 Crimes against humanity\\", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360 Sexual slavery was first recognized as a crime against humanity when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued arrest warrants based on the Geneva Conventions and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in Foƒça (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture and sexual enslavement by Bosnian Serb soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992. The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and enslavement as a crime against humanity. The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as an intrinsic part of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls ‚Äì some as young as 12 and 15 years of age ‚Äì in Foƒça, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The charges were brought as crimes against humanity and war crimes. Furthermore, two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual enslavement for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centers. Many of the women had subsequently disappeared. In areas controlled by Islamic militants, non-Muslim women are enslaved in occupied territories. Many Islamists see the abolition of slavery as forced upon Muslims by the West and want to revive the practice of slavery. (See: Slavery in 21st-century Islamism). In areas controlled by Catholic priests, clerical abuse of nuns, including sexual slavery, has been acknowledged by the Pope. =Bride kidnapping and raptio= The Rape of the Sabine Women, by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637‚Äì38 (Louvre Museum) Bride kidnapping, also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by captive, is a form of forced marriage practised in some traditional cultures. Bride kidnapping has reportedly occurred in countries spanning Central Asia, the Caucasus region, parts of Africa, and among the Hmong in southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe. Though the motivations behind bride kidnapping vary by region, the cultures with traditions of marriage by abduction are generally patriarchal with a strong social stigma against sex or pregnancy outside marriage and illegitimate births. Sabina Kiryashova, Azeri Bride Kidnappers Risk Heavy Sentences ; Gulo Kokhodze & Tamuna Uchidze, Bride Theft Rampant in Southern Georgia , where \\"great social stigma attaches to the suspicion of lost virginity.\\". Compare with Barbara Ayres, Bride Theft and Raiding for Wives in Cross-Cultural Perspective, Anthropological Quarterly, Vol. 47, No. 3, Kidnapping and Elopement as Alternative Systems of Marriage (Special Issue) (July 1974), pp. 245. (\\"There is no relationship between bride theft and status distinctions, bride price, or attitudes toward premarital virginity. The absence of strong associations in these areas suggests the need for a new hypothesis.\\".) In most cases, however, the men who resort to capturing a wife are often of lower social status, whether because of poverty, disease, poor character or criminality. In some cases, the couple collude together to elope under the guise of a bride kidnapping, presenting their parents with a fait accompli.George Scott, The Migrants Without Mountains: The Sociocultural Adjustment Among the Lao Hmong Refugees in San Diego (Ann Arbor, MI: A Bell And Howell Company, 1986), pp. 82‚Äì85 (Hmong culture); Alex Rodriguez, Kidnapping a Bride Practice Embraced in Kyrgyzstan, Augusta Chronicle, 24 July 2005 (Kyrgyz culture); These men are sometimes deterred from legitimately seeking a wife because of the payment the woman's family expects, the bride price (not to be confused with a dowry, paid by the woman's family).

The Mongols, with captured women, are on the left, the Hungarians, with one saved woman, on the right. Bride kidnapping is distinguished from raptio in that the former refers to the abduction of one woman by one man (and/or his friends and relatives), and is often a widespread and ongoing practice. The latter refers to the large-scale abduction of women by groups of men, most frequently in a time of war (see also war rape). The Latin term raptio refers to abduction of women, either for marriage (by kidnapping or elopement) or enslavement (particularly sexual slavery). In Roman Catholic canon law, raptio refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC). The practice of raptio is surmised to have existed since anthropological antiquity. In Neolithic Europe, excavation of a Linear Pottery culture site at Asparn- Schletz, Austria, unearthed the remains of numerous slain victims. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that perhaps the attackers had killed the men but abducted the young females.

Arch√§ologische Informationen 22, 1999, 215‚Äì239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of abduction of children rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at Thalheim. See E Biermann, √úberlegungen zur Bev√∂lkerungsgr√∂sse in Siedlungen der Bandkeramik (2001) =During armed conflict and war= Rape and sexual violence have accompanied warfare in virtually every known historical era. Before the 19th century, military circles supported the notion that all persons, including unarmed women and children, were still the enemy, with the belligerent (nation or person engaged in conflict) having conquering rights over them.Askin, 26‚Äì27 \\"To the victor goes the spoils\\" has been a war cry for centuries and women were included as part of the spoils of war.Askin, 10‚Äì21 Institutionalised sexual slavery and enforced prostitution have been documented in a number of wars, most notably the Second World War (See #During the Second World War) and in the War in Bosnia. Historical cases =Ancient Greece and Roman Empire= Employing female and occasionally male slaves for prostitution was common in the Hellenistic and Roman world. Ample references exist in literature, law, military reports and art. A prostitute (slave or free) existed outside the moral codex restricting sexuality in Greco-Roman society and enjoyed little legal protection. See ancient Rome's law on rape as an example. Male intercourse with a slave was not considered adultery by either society. =Asia= During the Chinese domination of Vietnam, Vietnamese girls were sold as sex slaves to the Chinese. Viet Nam History ‚Äì Part 2 (L·ªãch S·ª≠ Vi·ªát Nam ‚Äì ph·∫ßn 2) . thuvienbao.com A trade developed where the native girls of Vietnam were enslaved and brought north to the Chinese.Schafer (1963), p. 44 Natives in Fujian and Guizhou were sources of slaves as well.Schafer (1967), p. 56 Southern Yue girls were sexually eroticized in Chinese literature and in poems written by Chinese who were exiled to the south.Abramson (2011), p. 21 In the 16th and 17th centuries, Portuguese visitors and their South Asian lascar (and sometimes African) crewmembers often engaged in slavery in Japan, where they bought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as sexual slaves on their ships or taken to Macau and other Portuguese colonies in Southeast Asia, the Americas, and India. For example, in Goa, a Portuguese colony in India, there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries. Kisaeng, Korean women from outcast or slave families who were trained to provide entertainment, conversation, and sexual services to men of the upper class. During the 1662 Siege of Fort Zeelandia in which Chinese Ming loyalist forces commanded by Koxinga besieged and defeated the Dutch East India Company and conquered Taiwan, Dutch male prisoners were executed. The surviving women and children were then turned into slaves. Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their wives or concubines, and a teenage daughter of the Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek became a concubine to Koxinga. Some Dutch physical looks like auburn and red hair among people in regions of south Taiwan are a consequence of this episode.Manthorpe, 77 In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a network of Chinese prostitutes trafficked to cities like Singapore, and a separate network of Japanese prostitutes being trafficked across Asia, in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and British India, in what was then known as the 'Yellow Slave Traffic'. There was also a network of prostitutes from continental Europe being trafficked to India, Ceylon, Singapore, China and Japan at around the same time, in what was then known as the 'White Slave Traffic'. were Japanese girls and women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who were trafficked from poverty stricken agricultural prefectures in Japan to destinations in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Siberia (Russian Far East), Manchuria, and British India to serve as prostitutes and sexually serviced men from a variety of races, including Chinese, Europeans, native Southeast Asians, and others. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a network of Japanese prostitutes being trafficked across Asia, in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and British India, in what was then known as the 'Yellow Slave Traffic'. The main destinations of karayuki-san included China (particularly Shanghai), Hong Kong, the Philippines, Borneo, Sumatra, Thailand, Indonesia, and the western USA (in particular San Francisco). They were often sent to Western colonies in Asia where there was a strong demand from Western military personnel and Chinese men. The experience of Japanese prostitutes in China was written about in a book by a Japanese woman, Tomoko Yamazaki. Japanese girls were easily trafficked abroad since Korean and Chinese ports did not require Japanese citizens to use passports and the Japanese government realized that money earned by the karayuki-san helped the Japanese economy since it was being remitted, and the Chinese boycott of Japanese products in 1919 led to reliance on revenue from the karayuki-san. Since the Japanese viewed non-westerners as inferior, the karayuki-san Japanese women felt humiliated since they mainly sexually served Chinese men or native Southeast Asians. Borneo natives, Malaysians, Chinese, Japanese, French, American, British and men from every race utilized the Japanese prostitutes of Sandakan. A Japanese woman named Osaki said that the men, Japanese, Chinese, whites, and natives, were dealt with alike by the prostitutes regardless of race, and that a Japanese prostitute's \\"most disgusting customers\\" were Japanese men, while they used \\"kind enough\\" to describe Chinese men, and the English and Americans were the second best clients, while the native men were the best and fastest to have sex with. During World War II, Empire of Japan organised a governmental system of \\"comfort women\\", which is a euphemism of military sex slaves for the estimated 200,000, mostly Korean, Chinese, and Filipino women who were forced into sexual slavery in Japanese military \\"comfort stations\\" during World War II. Japan collected, carried, and confined Asian ladies coercively and collusively to have sexual intercourse with Japan's soldiers during their invasions across East Asia and Southeast Asia. Some Korean women claim that these cases should be judged by an international tribunal as child sex violence. The legal demand has been made because of the victims' anger at what they see as the inequity of the existing legal measures and the denial of Japan's involvement in child sex slavery and kidnapping. On 28 December 2015, Japan and South Korea agreed that Japan would pay 1 billion Yen into a fund for a Memorial Hall of comfort women. Despite this agreement, some Korean victims have complained that they were not consulted during the negotiation process. They demand that Japan and Korea did not seek both the legal recognition of their claim and the revision of Japanese history textbooks. =Arab slave trade= Slave trade, including trade of sex slaves, fluctuated in certain regions in the Middle East up until the 20th century. These slaves came largely from Sub-Saharan Africa (mainly Zanj), the Caucasus (mainly Circassians), \\"Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women‚ÄîInfanticide in Turkey,\\" New York Daily Times, 6 August 1856 Central Asia (mainly Sogdians) and Central and Eastern Europe (mainly Saqaliba). The Barbary pirates also captured 1.25 million slaves from Western Europe between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Stephen Behrendt, \\"Transatlantic Slave Trade\\", Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience (New York: Basic Civitas Books, 1999), . In contrast to the Atlantic slave trade where the male-female ratio was 2:1 or 3:1, the Arab slave trade usually had a higher female:male ratio instead, suggesting a general preference for female slaves. Concubinage and reproduction served as incentives for importing female slaves (often European), though many were also imported mainly for performing household tasks. =White slavery= In English-speaking countries in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the phrase \\"white slavery\\" was used to refer to sexual enslavement of white women. It was particularly associated with accounts of women enslaved in Middle Eastern harems, such as the so-called Circassian beauties.Linda Frost, Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850‚Äì1877, University of Minnesota Press, 2005, pp. 68‚Äì88. The phrase gradually came to be used as a euphemism for prostitution.In the US this usage became prominent around 1909: \\"a group of books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: a pervasive and depraved conspiracy was at large in the land, brutally trapping and seducing American girls into lives of enforced prostitution, or 'white slavery.' These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909.\\" Mark Thomas Connelly, The Response to Prostitution in the Progressive Era, University of North Carolina Press, 1980, p. 114 The phrase was especially common in the context of the exploitation of minors, with the implication that children and young women in such circumstances were not free to decide their own fates. Statue entitled The White Slave by Abastenia St. Leger Eberle, a controversial sculpture meant to depict modern western sexual enslavement In Victorian Britain, campaigning journalist William Thomas Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, procured a 13-year-old girl for ¬£5, an amount then equal to a labourer's monthly wage (see the Eliza Armstrong case). Moral panic over the \\"traffic in women\\" rose to a peak in England in the 1880s. At the time, \\"white slavery\\" was a natural target for defenders of public morality and crusading journalists. The ensuing outcry led to the passage of antislavery legislation in Parliament. Parliament passed the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act, raising the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen in that year. Cecil Adeams, \\"The Straight Dope: Was there really such a thing as \\"white slavery\\"? \\" 15 January 1999. A subsequent scare occurred in the United States in the early twentieth century, peaking in 1910, when Chicago's U.S. attorney announced (without giving details) that an international crime ring was abducting young girls in Europe, importing them, and forcing them to work in Chicago brothels. These claims, and the panic they inflamed, led to the passage of the United States White-Slave Traffic Act of 1910, generally known as the \\"Mann Act\\". It also banned the interstate transport of females for immoral purposes. Its primary intent was to address prostitution and immorality.Cecil Adams, op. cit. Immigration inspectors at Ellis Island in New York City were held responsible for questioning and screening European prostitutes from the U.S. Immigration inspectors expressed frustration at the ineffectiveness of questioning in determining if a European woman was a prostitute, and claimed that many were \\"lying\\" and \\"framing skillful responses\\" to their questions. They were also accused of negligence should they accept a fictitious address from an immigrant or accept less-than- complete responses. Inspector Helen Bullis investigated several homes of assignment in the Tenderloin district of New York, and found brothels existed in the early 20th century in New York City. She compiled a list of houses of prostitutes, their proprietors, and their \\"inmates\\". The New York inspection director wrote a report in 1907, defending against accusations of negligence, saying there was no sense to the public \\"panic\\", and he was doing everything he could to screen European immigrants for prostitution, especially unmarried ones. In a report by the Commissioner General of Immigration in 1914, the Commissioner said that many prostitutes would intentionally marry American men to secure citizenship. He said that for prostitutes, it was \\"no difficult task to secure a disreputable citizen who will marry a prostitute\\" from Europe. =Americas= From the beginning of African slavery in the North American colonies, the casual sexual abuse of African women and girls was common. Some historians have claimed that white men took enslaved African women as concubines or occasional mistresses. As populations increased, slave women were taken advantage of by plantation owners, white overseers, planters' younger sons before and after they married, and other white men associated with the slaveholders. Some African slave women and girls were sold into brothels outright. Pla√ßage, a formalized system of concubinage among slave women or free people of color, developed in Louisiana and particularly New Orleans by the 18th century. But it was fairly rare. White men had no obligation to trade anything for sex with black or mixed women. This left most of these women subject to the whims of white male pursuers. If another female caught his eye or the chosen women grew too old or too \\"difficult\\" in the minds of these White men these men could end the arrangement or continue the sexual contact without reward. The advancement of mixed-race blacks over their darker counterparts has led to the theory of consistent patronage by white fathers. While light skinned Blacks certainly enjoyed a level of privilege, there is little proof that most received educations and dowries directly from their white fathers. Most light-skinned blacks lived off of compensatory benefit received one to three generations early; and expanded on this usually in black and mixed-race enclaves where they could own businesses and earn a living as the educated/trained \\"blacks\\". These compensatory benefits occasionally came from white grand or great grandfathers. Other times, they came from former slave masters rewarding prized mixed-race slaves for years of service in \\"the house\\" or as close assistants to the Master (a position that darker blacks were afforded less often). A small portion of White fathers would pay for the education of their mixed-race children, especially sons, who might be educated in France and enter the army. In recent years, at least three historians (viz. Kenneth Aslakson, Emily Clark, and Carol Schlueter) have challenged the historicity of quadroon balls and have referred to the institution of Pla√ßage as \\"a myth\\". This was largely done to counter the modern-day manipulation of the idea of Pla√ßage by white racists and extremist black men. These two groups have referred to Pla√ßage as \\"proof\\" that American slave era sex was largely consensual, transactional, and different from sexual slavery inflicted on Asian, indo-native and White women during times of war, invasion, and colonization. Black men who mention Pla√ßage use it to state extremist, often conspiratorial claims that black women (slaves) sold themselves and their children to White men in a failed \\"plan\\" to advance themselves in America and undermine Black men. Why Black females of African descent are consistently ascribed such different experiences from White, Asian, and indo-native females when discussing sexual slavery and abuse, has long been a topic of debate. weburl=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon- ballstitle=Mixed Race Studies ¬ª quadroon ballsaccessdate=29 September 2016archive- url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002073440/http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon- ballsarchive-date=2 October 2016url-status=live}} Paul Heinegg's research claiming that most mixed-race, free black families in the censuses of 1790‚Äì1810 were descended from unions between free white women and African men, whether free or slave, in colonial Virginia- is highly questionable. But, this has also been used as proof of far less sexual abuse of black women and girls than previously believed; since these burgeoning mixed-race populations allegedly had white mothers. In the early colonial years, the working class of indentured servants and slaves often worked and lived together and it would be difficult to explain how these interactions would result in more mixed children from white mothers, since white males outnumbered white females in indentured servitude and paid labor. Hence, the likelihood of white male and black female workers and slaves interacting, forming unions, and procreating would be higher.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1995‚Äì2005 From the 17th century, Virginia and other colonies passed laws determining the social status of children born in the colonies. Under English common law in England, children of two English subjects took the status of the father. But Africans were never considered English subjects. To settle the issue of the status of children born in the colony, Virginia passed a law in 1662 that ruled that children would take the status of their mother at birth, under the Roman legal principle known as partus sequitur ventrem. Thus all children born to enslaved mothers were legally slaves, regardless of the paternity or ancestry of their fathers. They were bound for life and could be sold like any slave unless formally freed. The term \\"white slaves\\" was sometimes used for those mixed- race or mulatto slaves who had a visibly high proportion of European ancestry. Among the most notable at the turn of the 19th century was Sally Hemings, who was 3/4 white and believed by historians to be a half sister of Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson by their common father John Wayles. Hemings is known for having four surviving children from her decades-long concubinage with President Thomas Jefferson; they were 7/8 European by ancestry. Three of these mixed-race children passed easily into white society as adults (Jefferson freed them all ‚Äì two informally and two in his will). Three of his Hemings grandsons served as white men in the Union Regular Army in the American Civil War; John Wayles Jefferson advanced to the rank of colonel. Not all white fathers abandoned their slave children; some provided them with education, apprenticeships, or capital; a few wealthy planters sent their mixed-race children to the North for education and sometimes for freedom. Some men freed both their enslaved women and their mixed-race children, especially in the 20 years after the American Revolution, but southern legislatures made such manumissions more difficult. Both Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble wrote in the 19th century about the scandal of white men having enslaved Black women and natural mixed-race children as part of their extended households. Numerous mixed-race families were begun before the Civil War, and many originated in the Upper South. Zora Neale Hurston wrote about contemporary sexual practices in her anthropological studies in the 1930s of the turpentine camps of North Florida. She noted that white men with power often forced black women into sexual relationships. Although she never named the practice as \\"paramour rights,\\" author C. Arthur Ellis ascribed this term to the fictionalized Hurston in his book, Zora Hurston and the Strange Case of Ruby McCollum.Ellis, C. Arthur (Jr.). Zora Hurston and the Strange Case of Ruby McCollum (Chattanooga, TN: Gadfly Publishing, 2009). . The same character asserted that the death knell of paramour rights was sounded by the trial of Ruby McCollum, a black woman who murdered Dr. C. Leroy Adams, in Live Oak, Florida, in 1952. McCollum had testified that Adams forced her into sex and bearing his child. Journalist Hurston covered McCollum's trial in 1952 for the Pittsburgh Courier. McCollum's case was further explored in the 2015 documentary You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South. The Chinese Tanka females were sold from Guangzhou to work as prostitutes for the overseas Chinese male community in the United States. During the California Gold Rush in the late 1840s, Chinese merchants transported thousands of young Chinese girls, including babies, from China to the United States. They sold the girls into sexual slavery within the red light district of San Francisco. Girls could be bought for $40 (about $1104 in 2013 dollars) in Guangzhou and sold for $400 (about $11,040 in 2013 dollars) in the United States.

The leaders of the Wehrmacht became interested in running their own brothels when sexual disease spread among the soldiers. In the controlled brothels, the women were checked frequently to avoid and treat sexually transmittable infections (STI). It is estimated that a minimum of 34,140 women from occupied states were forced to work as prostitutes during the Third Reich.Nanda Herbermann (2000) The Blessed Abyss: Inmate #6582 in Ravensbruck Concentration Prison for Women.

The term refers to the women, from occupied countries, who were forced to serve as sex slaves in the Japanese army's camps during World War II. Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, with numbers ranging from as low as 20,000 from some Japanese scholars to as high as 410,000 from some Chinese scholars. The numbers are still being researched and debated. The majority of women were taken from Korea, China, and other occupied territories part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They were often recruited by kidnapping or deception to serve as sex slaves.Chosun Ilbo (19 March 2007) COMFORT WOMEN WERE 'RAPED': U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN. indonesia-ottawa.org Sometimes women were raped to the point of death, or killed by torture, such as having their breasts sliced off or having their abdomens slit open. Each slave reportedly suffered \\"an average of 10 rapes per day (considered by some to be a low estimate), for a five-day work week; this figure can be extrapolated to estimate that each 'comfort girl' was raped around 50 times per week or 2,500 times per year.

The RAA established its first brothel on 28 August: the Komachien in ≈åmori. By December 1945, the RAA owned 34 facilities, 16 of which were \\"comfort stations\\". The total number of prostitutes employed by the RAA amounted to 55,000 at its peak. The dispersal of prostitution made it harder for GHQ to control STIs and also caused an increase in rapes by GIs, from an average of 40 a day before the SCAP order to an estimated 330 per day immediately after. =During the Korean War= During the Korean War, the South Korean military institutionalized a \\"special comfort unit\\" similar to the one used by the Japanese military during World War II, kidnapping and pressing several North Korean women into sexual slavery. Until recently, very little was known about this apart from testimonies of retired generals and soldiers who had fought in the war. In February 2002, Korean sociologist Kim Kwi-ok wrote the first scholarly work on Korea's comfort women through official records.Soh, 347 The South Korean \\"comfort\\" system was organized around three operations. First, there were \\"special comfort units\\" called T'uksu Wiandae (ÌäπÏàòÏúÑÏïàÎåÄ, ÁâπÊÆäÊÖ∞ÂÆâÈöä), which operated from seven different stations. Second, there were mobile units of comfort women that visited barracks. Third, there were prostitutes who worked in private brothels that were hired by the military. Although it is still not clear how recruitment of these comfort women were organized in the South, South Korean agents were known to have kidnapped some of the women from the North.Soh, 215 According to anthropologist Chunghee Sarah Soh, the South Korean military's use of comfort women has produced \\"virtually no societal response,\\" despite the country's women's movement's support for Korean comfort women within the Japanese military. Both Kim and Soh argue that this system is a legacy of Japanese colonialism, as many of Korea's army leadership were trained by the Japanese military. Both the Korean and Japanese militaries referred to these comfort women as \\"military supplies\\" in official documents and personal memoirs. The South Korean armed forces also used the same arguments as the Japanese military to justify the use of comfort women, viewing them as a \\"necessary social evil\\" that would raise soldiers' morale and prevent rape.Soh, 216 Present day Official estimates of individuals in sexual slavery worldwide vary. In 2001 the International Organization for Migration estimated 400,000, the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated 700,000 and UNICEF estimated 1.75 million.

Sex trafficking in the United States may be present in Asian massage parlors, Mexican cantina bars, residential brothels, or street-based pimp-controlled prostitution. The anti-trafficking community in the United States is debating the extent of sexual slavery. Some groups argue that exploitation is inherent in the act of commercial sex, while other groups take a stricter approach to defining sexual slavery, considering an element of force, fraud or coercion to be necessary for sex slavery to exist. The prostitutes in illegal massage parlors may be forced to work out of apartment complexes for many hours a day. Many clients may not realize that some of the women who work in these massage sex parlors have actually been forced into prostitution. The women may initially be lured into the US under false pretenses. In huge debt to their 'owners', they are forced to earn enough to eventually \\"buy\\" their freedom. In some cases women who have been sex trafficked may be forced to undergo plastic surgery or abortions. A chapter in The Slave Next Door (2009) reports that human trafficking and sexual enslavement are not limited to any specific location or social class. It concludes that individuals in society need to be alert to report suspicious behavior, because the psychological and physical abuse occurs which can often leave a victim unable to escape on their own.Bales, Kevin and Ron Soodalter. The Slave Next Door: Human Trafficking and Slavery in America.

The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under- age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: \\"In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.\\" According to the Vancouver Sun, it's unclear whether or not Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute may not be able to be applied retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change. Former FLDS members have also alleged that children belonging to the sect were forced to perform sexual acts as children upon older men while being unable to leave.

The film itself is 46 mm wide, placing it between 35 mm and 120 \\"medium format\\" films in terms of size. The image format normally used is a square 4 cm √ó 4 cm. However, rectangular 4 cm √ó 3 cm and 4 cm √ó 6 cm are also standard. 127 enjoyed mainstream popularity until its usage began to decline from the 1960s onwards in the face of newer, cartridge-based films. However, it survives as a niche format and is still in production. Technical details 127 is a roll film, 46 mm wide. Frame number markings for the 4√ó4 and 4√ó6 image formats are printed on the backing paper, while 4√ó3 cameras typically have two frame counter windows, exposing the left and right halves of the 4√ó6 frame. Using the square format, there are 12 exposures per roll; 4√ó3 and 4√ó6 give 16 and 8, respectively. Less commonly, other frame sizes have been used. For its \\"Alfax\\" model (circa 1940), Kimura K≈çgaku had 4 cm √ó 4.5 cm frames, spaced by markings on the wind knob. In addition, the manufacturer C. F. Foth & Co. used an image format of 3.6 cm √ó 2.4 cm (the same size as is standard for 135) for initial versions of their 127-based \\"Derby\\" camera. History Kodak Verichrome VP127 film in various states The format was introduced by Kodak in 1912, along with the \\"Vest Pocket Kodak\\" folding camera, as a compact alternative to larger portable cameras using 120 film. The folding \\"127s\\" were in fact smaller than most 35 mm cameras today. The 127 format made a comeback during the 1950s as the format of choice for small inexpensive cameras such as the Brownie and Satellite, and continued in wide use until surpassed by the 126 film and 110 film \\"Instamatic\\" cartridges (introduced in 1963 and 1972 respectively), and especially by 35 mm. 127 cameras from that era were often characterized by simple box-like construction. Slides shot on 127 slide film were often preferred over 35 mm for example for sets of slides sold at tourist gift shops, because of the larger photo area (hence the advertised name \\"Superslides\\") and completely square dimensions of a 127 slide. The format was part of the ISO 732 standard until it was dropped in the third (1991) edition of that standard. Variations Not all 127 films were labelled as such. After 1913, many Kodak cameras included the Autographic feature, and Kodak's 127 films which had Autographic backing were identified as \\"A127\\". Other film manufacturers did not produce Autographic films, for which Kodak held a patent. Other camera manufacturers did make Vest Pocket-format cameras, however, and 127 film at the time was often labeled ‚ÄúVest Pocket Film‚Äù. Uses The format was mainly used for amateur cameras like the Brownie or the Zeiss Ikon Kolibri, with the Exakta SLR, the ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù Rolleiflex, the Yashica 44 TLR, the Komaflex-S SLR and the Primo jr as possible exceptions. 127 color transparencies can be mounted in standard 2‚Äù square slide mounts, and projected in an ordinary 35 mm projector. Because of their much greater area, the projected image is larger and more brilliant than a 35 mm slide, and they are popularly called \\"Superslides\\", a name once reserved for 40 √ó 40 mm slides cut down from 120 film. Production Kodak stopped producing 127 film in July 1995, with all but one manufacturer following suit shortly thereafter. Fotokemika of Samobor, Croatia, continued to make 127 film, which it sold under its own Efke brand, as well as custom-packaged for other sellers, until 2012. Macophoto UP100 and Jessops 200 were made and packaged by Fotokemika. Chromazone 127 film is also sold intermittently on eBay. In September 2006, Bluefire Laboratories of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, began packaging 127 color print film, cutting Kodak or Agfa film to size from bulk rolls, and assembling the rolls of film from their own components. In July 2009, Rollei (Maco Photo Products, Hans O. Mahn GmbH & Co. KG) introduced Rollei Retro 80S film, available in 127 format. In August 2014, Maco announced that they will be selling black-and-white 127 film under the Rera Pan brand. This film is manufactured in Japan by EZOX Corporation, who are better known for manufacturing agricultural equipment and bicycles.

Knauss was the oldest person ever from the United States, and the second-oldest fully documented person ever. She was recognized as the world's oldest living person by Guinness World Records from April 16, 1998, until her death.  Biography  Sarah DeRemer Clark was born on September 24, 1880, to Walter and Amelia Clark in Hollywood, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. She married Abraham Lincoln Knauss in 1901; originally a tanner, who became a prominent Lehigh County, Pennsylvania Republican leader, and the recorder of deeds from 1937 until retiring in 1951. Their only child Kathryn was born in 1903 and died in 2005 at the age of 101 years. Sarah's husband died in 1965 at 86 years old. In 1995, Knauss remarked that she enjoyed her life because she still had her health and could \\"do things.\\" At age 116, Knauss was recognized as being the new United States national longevity record holder, then thought to have been Carrie C. White (reportedly 1874‚Äì1991). In 1998, she became the world's oldest person when 117-year-old French Canadian Marie-Louise Meilleur died. Before her death, there were six living generations in her family. At 104, she moved in with her daughter Kathryn Knauss Sullivan. She died of natural causes on December 30, 1999, at the Phoebe Home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where she had lived for the final nine years of her life. A member of staff of the nursing home described her as \\"the friendliest person she had ever met among the home's residents\\". Of her death, state senator Charlie Dent, who had attended her 115th birthday party in 1995, said, \\"Mrs. Knauss was an extraordinary woman who pushed the outer limits of longevity. This is a sad occasion, but she certainly had an eventful life.\\" Verification and double-checking of her age Robert Young of the Gerontology Research Group has previously verified Sarah Knauss's claimed age of 119 years and 97 days and concluded that Sarah Knauss was likely the age claimed.https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/drm/007/3-3.pdf Specifically, Young found a 1900 US Census entry for Knauss (then known as Sarah D. Clark) that gave her age as 19, and that also explicitly gave her year and month of birth as September 1880. In addition, an August 28, 1901 marriage certificate for Sarah Knauss gives her age as 21, which roughly matches with a September 1880 birthday considering that, with such a birthday, she would have been less than one month short of age 21 at this time. Sarah Knauss is listed (as Sadie Knauss) as age 29 in the 1910 US Census and (as Sarah Knauss) as age 49 in the 1930 US Census (with her 1930 US Census entry listing her age at first marriage as 21, matching the information on her 1901 marriage record)‚Äîboth of which also imply her birth date was in September 1880. Later research resulted in the discovery of a US Census directory of Northampton County, Pennsylvania created by Joseph H. Werner in 1891 (the contents of which have been published online since at least 2008) that published the entire 1890 US Census results for this county‚Äîincluding Sarah Knauss and her family, who lived in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (within this county; it became part of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1917) back then. This 1891 directory states that the 1890 US Census listed Sarah Knauss (then known as Sarah D. Clark) as age 10, which is roughly consistent with a September 1880 birth date considering that she was just a couple of months short of her 10th birthday at the time of the 1890 US Census in June 1890. (The 1890 US Census returns themselves were almost completely destroyed in a 1921 fire, but this 1891 US Census directory of the 1890 US Census results for Northampton County, Pennsylvania has survived.) The entire entry for the Clark family in this 1891 directory (which, again, is a copy of their 1890 US Census entry from June 1890) included 41-year-old Walter Clark (with his job being listed as \\"carpenter\\"), his 33-year-old wife Amelia Clark, their 12-year-old son Charles H. Clark, their 10-year-old daughter Sarah D. Clark (later Sarah Knauss), and their 1-year-old son Foster E. Clark. This evidence further strengthens the case favoring Sarah Knauss indeed being born in September 1880.

Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style, with sharp- pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. The script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during World War I. The film makes use of a frame story, with a prologue and epilogue which, in a twist ending, reveals the main narrative is actually the delusion of a madman. Janowitz has claimed this device was forced upon the writers against their will. The film's design was handled by Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter R√∂hrig, who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one. The film thematizes brutal and irrational authority. Writers and scholars have argued the film reflects a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, and is an example of Germany's obedience to authority and unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority. Some critics have interpreted Caligari as representing the German war government, with Cesare symbolic of the common man conditioned, like soldiers, to kill. Other themes of the film include the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, the subjective perception of reality, and the duality of human nature. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was released just as foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \\"the first true horror film\\", and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir. Plot As Francis (Friedrich Feh√©r) sits on a bench with an older man who complains that spirits have driven him away from his family and home, a dazed woman named Jane (Lil Dagover) passes them. Francis explains she is his \\"fianc√©e\\" and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback of Francis's story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. Francis and his friend Alan (Hans Heinz v. Twardowski), who are good-naturedly competing for Jane's affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt). The clerk mocks and berates Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed. The next morning, Francis and Alan visit Caligari's spectacle, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. On Caligari's order, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis's protests, Alan asks, \\"How long shall I live?\\" To Alan's horror, Cesare answers, \\"The time is short. You die at dawn!\\" Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan's home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen (Rudolf Lettinger), who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olson, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame onto the real murderer. At night, Francis spies on Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Caligari's sideshow and realize that the \\"Cesare\\" sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum. Upon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 11th-century monk named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The director screams, \\"I must become Caligari!\\" Francis and the doctors call the police to Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a straitjacket, and becomes an inmate in his own asylum. The narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a twist ending, Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis refers to as \\"Dr. Caligari\\" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Caligari was confined in Francis's story. The director announces that, now that he understands Francis's delusion, he is confident he can cure him.

Twardowski as Alan * Rudolf Lettinger as Dr. Olsen Production =Writing= The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, both of whom were pacifists by the time they met following World War I. Janowitz served as an officer during the war, but the experience left him embittered with the military, which affected his writing. Mayer feigned madness to avoid military service during the war, which led him to intense examinations from a military psychiatrist. The experience left him distrustful of authority, and the psychiatrist served as a model for the Caligari character. Janowitz and Mayer were introduced in June 1918 by a mutual friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Both writers were penniless at the time. Gilda Langer, an actress with whom Mayer was in love, encouraged Janowitz and Mayer to write a film together. She later became the basis for the Jane character. Langer also encouraged Janowitz to visit a fortune teller, who predicted that Janowitz would survive his military service during the war, but Langer would die. This prediction proved true, as Langer died unexpectedly in 1920 at the age of 23, and Janowitz said it inspired the scene in which Cesare predicts Alan's death at the fair. Although neither had any associations with the film industry, Janowitz and Mayer wrote a script over six weeks during the winter of 1918‚Äì19. In describing their roles, Janowitz called himself \\"the father who planted the seed, and Mayer the mother who conceived and ripened it\\". The Expressionist filmmaker Paul Wegener was among their influences. The story was partially inspired by a circus sideshow the two visited on Kantstrasse in Berlin, called \\"Man or Machine?\\", in which a man performed feats of great strength after becoming hypnotized. They first visualized the story of Caligari the night of that show. Several of Janowitz's past experiences influenced his writing, including memories of his hometown of Prague, and, as he put it, a mistrust of \\"the authoritative power of an inhuman state gone mad\\" due to his military service. Janowitz also believed he had witnessed a murder in 1913 near an amusement park on Hamburg's Reeperbahn, beside the Holstenwall, which served as another inspiration for the script. According to Janowitz, he observed a woman disappear into some bushes, from which a respectable-looking man emerged a few moments later, and the next day Janowitz learned the girl was murdered. Holstenwall later became the name of the town setting in Caligari. Janowitz and Mayer are said to have set out to write a story denouncing arbitrary authority as brutal and insane. Janowitz said it was only years after the film was released that he realized exposing the \\"authoritative power of an inhuman state\\" was the \\"subconscious intention\\" of the writers. However, Hermann Warm, who designed the film's sets, said Mayer had no political intentions when he wrote the film. Film historian David Robinson noted Janowitz did not refer to anti-authority intentions in the script until many decades after Caligari was released, and he suggested Janowitz's recollection may have changed in response to later interpretations to the film. The film they wrote was entitled Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, using the English spelling Cabinet rather than the German Kabinett. The completed script contained 141 scenes. Janowitz has claimed the name Caligari, which was not settled upon until after the script was finished, was inspired by a rare book called Unknown Letters of Stendhal, which featured a letter from the French novelist Stendhal referring to a French officer named Caligari he met at the La Scala theatre in Milan. However, no record of any such letter exists, and film historian John D. Barlow suggested Janowitz may have fabricated the story. The physical appearance of Caligari was inspired by portraits of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. The character's name is spelled Calligaris in the only known surviving script, although in some instances the final s is removed. Other character names are also spelled differently from the final film: Cesare appears as Caesare, Alan is Allan or sometimes Alland and Dr. Olfen is Dr. Olfens. Likewise, unnamed characters in the final film have names in the script, including the town clerk (\\"Dr. L√ºders\\") and the house-breaker (\\"Jakob Straat\\"). The story of Caligari is told abstractly, like a fairy tale, and includes little description about or attention toward the psychological motivations of the characters, which is more heavily emphasized in the film's visual style. The original script shows few traces of the Expressionist influence prevalent in the film's sets and costumes. Through film director Fritz Lang, Janowitz and Mayer met with Erich Pommer, head of production at the Decla-Bioscop film studio, on 19 April 1919, to discuss selling the script. According to Pommer, he attempted to get rid of them, but they persisted until he agreed to meet with them. Pommer reportedly asked the writers to leave the script with him, but they refused, and instead Mayer read it aloud to him. Pommer and his assistant, Julius Sternheim, were so impressed that he refused to let them leave until a contract was signed, and he purchased the script from them that night. The writers had originally sought no fewer than 10,000 marks, but were given 3,500, with the promise of another 2,000 once the film went into production and 500 if it was sold for foreign release, which the producers considered unlikely. The contract, today preserved at Berlin's Bundesfilmarchiv, gave Pommer the right to make any changes to the script deemed appropriate. Pommer said he was drawn to the script because he believed it could be filmed inexpensively, and it bore similarities to films inspired by the macabre horror shows of the Grand Guignol theatre in Paris, which were popular at the time. Pommer later said: \\"They saw in the script an 'experiment'. I saw a relatively cheap film\\". Frame story The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari makes use of a \\"Rahmenerz√§hlung\\", or frame story; a prologue and epilogue establish the main body of the film as a delusional flashback, a novel technique. Lang has said that, during early discussions about his possible involvement with the film, he suggested the addition of an opening scene with a \\"normal\\" style, which would lead the public into the rest of the film without confusion. It remains unclear whether Lang suggested the frame story structure or simply gave advice on how to write a frame story that was already agreed and some writers, like David Robinson, have questioned whether Lang's recollection is correct. The director, Robert Wiene, was supportive of the changes. Janowitz has claimed he and Mayer were not privy to discussions about adding the frame story and strongly opposed its inclusion, believing it had deprived the film of its revolutionary and political significance; he wrote that it was \\"an illicit violation, a raping of our work\\" that turned the film \\"into a clich√© ... in which the symbolism was to be lost\\". Janowitz claims the writers sought legal action to stop the change but failed. He also claims they did not see the finished film with the frame story until a preview was shown to studio heads, after which the writers \\"expressed our dissatisfaction in a storm of thunderous remonstrances\\". They had to be persuaded not to publicly protest against the film. In his 1947 book From Caligari to Hitler, Siegfried Kracauer argued, based largely on an unpublished typescript written and provided by Janowitz, that the film originally included no frame story and started with the fair coming to town and ended with Caligari becoming institutionalized. Kracauer argued the frame story glorified authority and was added to turn a \\"revolutionary\\" film into a \\"conformistic\\" one. No surviving copies of the script were believed to exist until the early 1950s when actor Werner Krauss revealed he still had his copy. He refused to part with it; only in 1978, two decades after his death, was it purchased by the German film archive Deutsche Kinemathek. It remained unavailable for public consumption until 1995, when a full transcript was published. The script revealed that a frame story was part of the original Caligari screenplay, albeit a different one from that in the film. The original manuscript opens on an elegant terrace of a large villa, where Francis and Jane are hosting a party and the guests insist that Francis tell them a story that happened to him 20 years earlier. The conclusion to the frame story is missing from the script. Critics widely agree that the discovery of the screenplay strongly undermines Kracauer's theory, with some, like the German film historian Stephen Brockmann, even arguing it disproves his claims altogether. Others, like John D. Barlow, argue that it does not settle the issue, as the original screenplay's frame story simply serves to introduce the main plot, rather than subvert it as the final film's version does. =Development= Many details about the making of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are in dispute and will probably remain unsettled due to the large number of people involved in the making of the film, many of whom have recalled it differently or dramatized their own contributions to its production. Production of the film was delayed about four or five months after the script was purchased. Pommer originally chose Lang as the director of Caligari, and Lang even went so far as to hold preparatory discussions about the script with Janowitz, but he became unavailable due to his involvement with the filming of The Spiders, so Wiene was selected instead. According to Janowitz, Wiene's father, a successful theatre actor, had \\"gone slightly mad when he could no longer appear on the stage\\", and Janowitz believed that experience helped Wiene bring an \\"intimate understanding\\" to the source material of Caligari. alt=A sepia-tinted drawing of a city landscape, with several tilted buildings packed tightly together in sharp angles on a steep hill. Decla producer Rudolf Meinert introduced Hermann Warm to Wiene and provided Warm with the Caligari script, asking him to come up with proposals for the design. Warm believed \\"films must be drawings brought to life\\", and felt a naturalistic set was wrong for the subject of the film, instead recommending a fantastic, graphic style, in which the images would be visionary, nightmarish and out of the ordinary. Warm brought to the project his two friends, painters and stage designers Walter Reimann and Walter R√∂hrig, both of whom were associated with the Berlin art and literary magazine Der Sturm. The trio spent a full day and part of the night reading the script, after which Reimann suggested an Expressionist style, a style often used in his own paintings. They also conceived the idea of painting forms and shadows directly onto the sets to ensure a dark and unreal look. According to Warm, the three approached Wiene with the idea and he immediately agreed, although Wiene has made claims that he conceived the film's Expressionist style. Meinert agreed to the idea after one day's consideration, telling Warm, Reimann and R√∂hrig to make the sets as \\"crazy\\" and \\"eccentrically\\" as possible. He embraced the idea for commercial, not aesthetic reasons: Expressionism was fashionable at the time, so he concluded even if the film received bad reviews, the artistic style would garner attention and make it profitable. Wiene filmed a test scene to demonstrate Warm, Reimann and R√∂hrig's theories, and it so impressed the producers that the artists were given free rein. Pommer later said he was responsible for placing Warm, Reimann and R√∂hrig in charge of the sets, but Warm has claimed that, although Pommer was in charge of production at Decla when Caligari was made, he was not actually a producer on the film itself. Instead, he says Meinert was the film's true producer, and that it was he who gave Warm the manuscript. Warm claimed Meinert produced the film \\"despite the opposition of a part of the management of Decla\\". Meinert said Pommer had \\"not sanctioned\\" the film's abstract visual style. Nevertheless, Pommer claimed to have supervised Caligari, and that the film's Expressionistic style was chosen in part to differentiate it from competing Hollywood films. The predominant attitude at the time was that artistic achievement led to success in exports to foreign film markets. The dominance of Hollywood at the time, coupled with a period of inflation and currency devaluation, forced German film studios to seek projects that could be made inexpensively, with a combination of realistic and artistic elements so the films would be accessible to American audiences, yet also distinctive from Hollywood films. Pommer has claimed while Mayer and Janowitz expressed a desire for artistic experimentation in the film, his decision to use painted canvases as scenery was primarily a commercial one, as they would be a significant financial saving over building sets. Janowitz claims he attempted to commission the sets from designer and engraver Alfred Kubin, known for his heavy use of light and shadow to create a sense of chaos, but Kubin declined to participate in the project because he was too busy. In a conflicting story, however, Janowitz claimed he requested from Decla \\"Kubin paintings\\", and that they misread his instructions as \\"cubist painters\\" and hired Reimann and R√∂hrig as a result. David Robinson argues this story was probably an embellishment stemming from Janowitz's disdain for the two artists. Janowitz has claimed that he and Mayer conceived the idea of painting the sets on canvas, and that the shooting script included written directions that the scenery be designed in Kubin's style. However, the later rediscovery of the original screenplay refutes this claim, as it includes no such directions about the sets. This was also disputed in a 1926 article by Barnet Braverman in Billboard magazine, which claimed the script included no mention of an unconventional visual style, and that Janowitz and Mayer in fact strongly opposed the stylization. She claims Mayer later came to appreciate the visual style, but that Janowitz remained opposed to it years after the film's release. The set design, costumes and props took about two weeks to prepare. Warm worked primarily on the sets, while R√∂hrig handled the painting and Reimann was responsible for the costumes. Robinson noted the costumes in Caligari seem to resemble a wide variety of time periods. For example, Caligari and the fairground workers' costumes resemble the Biedermeier era, while Jane's embody Romanticism. Additionally, Robinson wrote, Cesare's costume and those of policemen in the film appear abstract, while many of the other characters' seem like ordinary German clothes from the 1920s. The collaborative nature of the film's production highlights the importance that both screenwriters and set designers held in German cinema of the 1920s, although film critic Lotte H. Eisner said sets held more importance than anything else in German films at that time. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was the first German Expressionist film, although Brockmann and film critic Mike Budd claim it was also influenced by German Romanticism; Budd notes the film's themes of insanity and the outcry against authority are common among German Romanticism in literature, theatre and the visual arts. Film scholar Vincent LoBrutto said the theatre of Max Reinhardt and the artistic style of Die Br√ºcke were additional influences on Caligari. =Casting= alt=A man wearing round-framed glasses, wearing a black coat and shirt, and white gloves with black lines along the knuckle lines. The man is looking off camera with a concerned look on his face. Janowitz originally intended the part of Cesare to go to his friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Mayer wrote the part of Jane for Gilda Langer, but by the time the film was cast Langer's interests had moved on from Janowitz and Mayer to director Paul Czinner, leaving the role to be played by Lil Dagover. Janowitz claimed he wrote the part of Caligari specifically for Werner Krauss, whom Deutsch had brought to his attention during rehearsals for a Max Reinhardt play; Janowitz said only Krauss or Paul Wegener could have played the part. The parts of Caligari and Cesare ultimately went to Krauss and Conrad Veidt, respectively, who enthusiastically took part in many aspects of the production. Krauss suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes, including the elements of a top hat, cape and walking stick with an ivory handle for his character. The actors in Caligari were conscious of the need to adapt their make-up, costumes and appearance to match the visual style of the film. Much of the acting in German silent films at the time was already Expressionistic, mimicking the pantomimic aspects of Expressionist theatre. The performances of Krauss and Veidt in Caligari were typical of this style, as they both had experience in Expressionist-influenced theatre, and as a result John D. Barlow said they appear more comfortable in their surroundings in the film than the other actors. Prior to filming, Kraus and Veidt appeared on stage in the winter of 1918 in an Expressionist drama, Reinhold Goering's Seeschlacht, at the Deutsches Theater. By contrast, Dagover had little experience in Expressionist theatre, and Barlow argues her acting is less harmonious with the film's visual style. Wiene asked the actors to make movements similar to dance, most prominently from Veidt, but also from Krauss, Dagover and Friedrich Feger, who played Francis. Krauss and Veidt are the only actors whose performances fully match the stylization of the sets, which they achieved by concentrating their movements and facial expressions. Barlow notes that \\"Veidt moves along the wall as if it had 'exuded' him ... more a part of a material world of objects than a human one\\", and Krauss \\"moves with angular viciousness, his gestures seem broken or cracked by the obsessive force within him, a force that seems to emerge from a constant toxic state, a twisted authoritarianism of no human scruple and total insensibility\\". Most of the other actors besides Krauss and Veidt have a more naturalistic style. Alan, Jane and Francis play the roles of an idyllically happy trio enjoying youth; Alan in particular represents the archetype of a sensitive 19th-century student. Mike Budd points out realist characters in stylized settings are a common characteristic in Expressionist theatre. However, David Robinson notes even the performances of the more naturalistic supporting roles in Caligari have Expressionist elements, like Hans-Heinz von Twardowski's \\"strange, tormented face\\" as Alan. He also cites Feher's \\"large angular movements\\", especially in the scene where he searches the deserted fairground. Other minor roles are Expressionistic in nature, like two policemen who sit facing each other at their desks and move with exaggerated symmetry, and two servants who awaken and rise from their beds in perfect synchronization. Vincent LoBrutto said of the acting in the film: =Filming= Shooting for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari began at the end of December 1919 and concluded at the end of January 1920. It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming. Hermann Warm, however, claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production. Caligari was filmed in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstra√üe), Wei√üensee, a north-eastern suburb of Berlin. Decla had been making films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, The Plague of Florence (Die Pest in Florenz) (1919) and the two parts of The Spiders (Die Spinnen).Robinson may be in error here about the previous owner of the Lixie studio (whose exact address he does not give): it was almost certainly not Vitascope GmbH, but rather Continental-Kunstfilm. The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film did not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none of which could be achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period. alt=A black screen with green faded shapes in the background, and green words in German language written in angled block letters in the foreground.Several scenes from the script were cut during filming, most of which were brief time lapses or transitioning scenes, or title screens deemed unnecessary. One of the more substantial scenes to be cut involved the ghost of Alan at a cemetery. The scene with the town clerk berating Caligari deviated notably from the original script, which simply called for the clerk to be \\"impatient\\". He is far more abusive in the scene as it was filmed, and is perched atop an exaggeratedly high bench that towers over Caligari. Another deviation from the script comes when Caligari first awakens Cesare, one of the most famous moments in the film. The script called for Cesare to gasp and struggle for air, then shake violently and collapse in Caligari's arms. As it was filmed, there is no such physical struggling, and instead the camera zooms in on Cesare's face as he gradually opens his eyes. The original title cards for Caligari featured stylized, misshapen lettering with excessive underlinings, exclamation points and occasionally archaic spellings. The bizarre style, which matches that of the film as a whole, mimics the lettering of Expressionistic posters at the time. The original title cards were tinted in green, steely-blue and brown. Many modern prints of the film do not preserve the original lettering. Photography was provided by Willy Hameister, who went on to work with Wiene on several other films. The camerawork in Caligari is fairly simple and is used primarily to show the sets, mostly alternating between medium shots and straight-on angles, with occasionally abrupt close- ups to create a sense of shock. There are few long shots or panning movement within the cinematography. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari more of a theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films. Visual style alt=A man shakes hands with a woman, while another man looks on between them. The three figures stand in the iddle of a city street, with brick walls in twisted and distorted shapes, and shadows and streaks of light painted onto the walls and ground. The visual style of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and deliberate distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance. The sets are dominated by sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets, and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment. Film critic Roger Ebert described it as \\"a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives\\". The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint. The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, as opposed to a constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three- dimensionality. Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys. Lotte Eisner, author of The Haunted Screen, writes that objects in the film appear as if they are coming alive and \\"seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality\\". Rudolf Kurtz, screenwriter and author of Expressionismus und Film, likewise wrote \\"the dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created\\". The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall. Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles. German film professor Anton Kaes wrote, \\"The style of German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers to experiment with filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations\\". The visual style of Caligari conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer, giving the impression of a nightmare or deranged sensibility, or a place transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings \\"amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments\\". The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown, giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman. As with German Expressionist paintings, the visual style of Caligari reflects an emotional reaction to the world, and the film's characters represent an emotional response to the terror of society as embodied by Caligari and Cesare. Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem too big for the small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind. Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state. Stephen Brockmann argues the fact that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because \\"there is no access to a natural world beyond the realm of the tortured human psyche\\". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they are the only ones who truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background. A select few scenes disrupt the Expressionistic style of the film, such as in Jane's and Alan's home, which include normal backgrounds and bourgeois furniture that convey a sense of security and tranquility otherwise absent from the film. Eisner called this a \\"fatal\\" continuity error, but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing it is a common characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off- putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background. Robinson suggested Caligari is not a true example of Expressionism at all, but simply a conventional story with some elements of the art form applied to it. He argues the story itself is not Expressionistic, and the film could have easily been produced in a traditional style, but that Expressionist-inspired visuals were applied to it as decoration. Similarly, Budd has called the film a conventional, classical narrative, resembling a detective story in Francis's search to expose Alan's killer, and said it is only the film's Expressionist settings that make the film transgressive. Hans Janowitz has entertained similar thoughts as well: \\"Was this particular style of painting only a garment in which to dress the drama? Was it only an accident? Would it not have been possible to change this garment, without injury to the deep effect of the drama? I do not know.\\" Release alt=A sepia-tinted close-up of a man looking directly forward with wide eyes. He has short black hair and pale white skin, and is wearing a black shirt with a high collar. Though often considered an art film by some modern critics and scholars, Caligari was produced and marketed the same way as a normal commercial production of its time period, able to target both the elite artistic market as well as a more commercial horror genre audience. The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, \\"Du musst Caligari werden!\\", or \\"You must become Caligari!\\" Caligari premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed. The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, on his way to the theatre, reportedly exclaimed, \\"It will be a horrible failure for all of us!\\" As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere. One, offered by writers Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel in The German Cinema, suggests the film was shelved \\"for lack of a suitable outlet\\", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through. Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked Caligari back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation. On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare opened his eyes during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane. Caligari was released at a time when foreign film industries had just started easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I. The film was acquired for American distribution by the Goldwyn Distributing Company, and had its American premiere at the Capitol Theatre in New York City on 3 April 1921. It was given a live theatrical prologue and epilogue, which was not unusual for film premieres at major theatres at the time. In the prologue, the film is introduced by a character called \\"Cranford\\", who identifies himself as the man Francis speaks with in the opening scene. In the epilogue, Cranford returns and exclaims that Francis has fully recovered from his madness. Mike Budd believes these additions simplified the film and \\"adjusted [it] for mass consumption\\", though Robinson argued it was simply a normal theatrical novelty for the time. Capitol Theatre runner Samuel Roxy Rothafel commissioned conductor Ern√∂ Rap√©e to compile a musical accompaniment that included portions of songs by composers Johann Strauss III, Arnold Schoenberg, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Rotafel wanted the score to match the dark mood of the film, saying: \\"The music had, as it were, to be made eligible for citizenship in a nightmare country\\". Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but the theatre was forced to pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was organized by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections to the content of Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; Thompson concluded it was a box office success and Pratt concluded it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative. Caligari did not immediately receive a wide distribution in France due to fears over the import of German films, but film director Louis Delluc organized a single screening of it on 14 November 1921, at the Colis√©e cinema in Paris as part of a benefit performance for the Spanish Red Cross. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Cin√©- Op√©ra on 2 March 1922. Caligari played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of Emmanuelle (1974). According to Janowitz, Caligari was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as outside Europe in China, Japan, India and Turkey, and also in South American nations. Reception =Critical response= alt=An image of a lobby card with a photograph in the center, and small text captions underneath it. The image shows a man in a dark coat, cape, and top hat standing to the right, while two men investigate another man who is sitting upright inside an open box. There are differing accounts as to how Caligari was first received by audiences and critics immediately after its release. Stephen Brockmann, Anton Kaes and film theorist Kristin Thompson say it was popular with both the general public and well- respected by critics. Robinson wrote, \\"The German critics, almost without exception, ranged from favourable to ecstatic\\". Kracauer said critics were \\"unanimous in praising Caligari as the first work of art on the screen\\", but also said it was \\"too high-brow to become popular in Germany\\". Barlow said it was often the subject of critical disapproval, which he believes is because early film reviewers attempted to assign fixed definitions to the young art of cinema, and thus had trouble accepting the bizarre and unusual elements of Caligari. Some critics felt it imitated a stage production too closely. Other commentators, like critic Herbert Ihering and novelist Blaise Cendrars, objected to the presentation of the story as a madman's delusion because they felt it belittled Expressionism as an artform. Theatre critic Helmut Grosse condemned the film's visual design as clich√©d and derivative, calling it a \\"cartoon and [a] reproduction of designs rather than from what actually took place on stage\\". Several reviewers, like Kurt Tucholsky and Blaise Cendrars, criticized the use of real actors in front of artificially-painted sets, saying it created an inconsistent level of stylization. Critic Herbert Ihering echoed this point in a 1920 review: \\"If actors are acting without energy and are playing within landscapes and rooms which are formally 'excessive', the continuity of the principle is missing\\". While Robinson said the response from American critics was largely positive and enthusiastic, Kaes said American critics and audiences were divided: some praised its artistic value and others, particularly those distrustful of Germany following World War I, wished to ban it altogether. Some in the Hollywood film industry felt threatened by the potential rivalry and spoke out against Caligari's release, condemning it as a \\"foreign invasion\\". Nevertheless, the film remained popular in the United States. Several American reviewers compared it to an Edgar Allan Poe story, including in a 1921 review in Variety magazine, which praised the direction and \\"perfect tempo\\" of the film, as well as the sets that \\"squeeze and turn and adjust the eye, and through the eye the mentality\\". A New York Times review likened it to modernist art, comparing the film's sets to Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, and said the film \\"gives dimensions and meaning to shape, making it an active part of the story, instead of merely the conventional and inert background\\", which was key to the film's \\"importance as a work of cinematography\\". Albert Lewin, a critic who eventually became a film director and screenwriter, called Caligari \\"the only serious picture, exhibited in America so far, that in anything like the same degree has the authentic thrills and shock of art\\". A story in a November 1921 edition of Exceptional Photoplays, an independent publication issued by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, said it \\"occupies the position of unique artistic merit\\", and said American films in comparison looked like they were made for \\"a group of defective adults at the nine-year-old level\\". Caligari was a critical success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. Abel Gance called it \\"superb\\" and wrote, \\"What a lesson to all directors!\\" and Ren√© Clair said it \\"overthrew the realist dogma\\" of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: \\"At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as a slap in the face.\\" Jean Epstein, however, called it \\"a prize example of the abuse of d√©cor in the cinema\\" and said it \\"represents a grave sickness of cinema\\". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it \\"the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera\\". French critic Fr√©d√©ric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: \\"It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth.\\" The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari, calling it a \\"combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras\\". While early reviews were more divided, modern film critics and historians have largely praised Caligari as a revolutionary film. Film reviewer Roger Ebert called it arguably \\"the first true horror film\\", and critic Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. In October 1958, Caligari was ranked as the twelfth-best film of all time during a poll organized at the Brussels World's Fair. With input from 117 film critics, filmmakers and historians from around the world, it was the first universal film poll in history. American film historian Lewis Jacobs said \\"its stylized rendition, brooding quality, lack of explanation, and distorted settings were new to the film world\\". Film historian and critic Paul Rotha wrote of it, \\"For the first time in the history of the cinema, the director has worked through the camera and broken with realism on the screen; that a film could be effective dramatically when not photographic and finally, of the greatest possible importance, that the mind of the audience was brought into play psychologically\\". Likewise, Arthur Knight wrote in Rogue: \\"More than any other film, (Caligari) convinced artists, critics and audiences that the movie was a medium for artistic expression\\". Entertainment Weekly included Caligari in their 1994 \\"Guide to the Greatest Movies Ever Made\\", calling it a \\"landmark silent film\\" and saying, \\"No other film's art direction has ever come up with so original a visualization of dementia\\". The film holds an approval rating of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 62 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.30/10. The site's critics' consensus states: \\"Arguably the first true horror film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari set a brilliantly high bar for the genre ‚Äì and remains terrifying nearly a century after it first stalked the screen.\\" =Legacy= Caligari is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, and by far the most famous example of it. It is considered a classic film, often shown in introductory film courses, film societies and museums, and is one of the most famous German films from the silent era. Film scholar Lewis Jacobs called it the \\"most widely discussed film of the time\\". Caligari helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema, while also bringing legitimacy to the cinema among literary intellectuals within Germany itself. Lotte Eisner has said it was in Expressionism, as epitomized in Caligari, that \\"the German cinema found its true nature\\". The term caligarism was coined as a result, referring to a style of similar films that focus on such themes as bizarre madness and obsession, particularly through the use of visual distortion. Expressionism was late in coming to cinema, and by the time Caligari was released, many German critics felt the art form had become commercialized and trivialized; such well-known writers as Kasimir Edschmid, Ren√© Schickele, and Yvan Goll had already pronounced the Expressionist movement dead by the time Caligari arrived in theatres. Few other purely Expressionistic films were produced, and Caligari was the only one readily accessible for several decades. Among the few films to fully embrace the Expressionist style were Genuine (1920) and Raskolnikow (1923), both directed by Wiene, as well as From Morn to Midnight (1920), Torgus (1921), Das Haus zum Mond (1921), Haus ohne T√ºr und ohne Fenster (1921) and Waxworks. While few other purely Expressionistic films were made, Caligari still had a major influence over other German directors, and many of the film's Expressionist elements ‚Äì particularly the use of setting, light and shadow to represent the dark psychology of its characters ‚Äì became prevalent in German cinema. Among the films to use these elements were Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) and The Last Laugh (1924), G. W. Pabst's Secrets of a Soul (1926), and Lang's Metropolis (1927) and M (1931). The success of Caligari also affected the way in which German films were produced during the 1920s. For example, the majority of major German films over the next few years moved away from location shooting and were fully filmed in studios, which assigned much more importance to designers in German cinema. Robinson argues this led to the rise of a large number of film designers ‚Äì such as Hans Dreier, Rochus Gliese, Albin Grau, Otto Hunte, Alfred Junge, Erich Kettelhut and Paul Leni ‚Äì and that effect was felt abroad as many of these talents later emigrated from Germany with the rise of the National Socialist German Workers Party. Additionally, the success of Caligari's collaborative effort ‚Äì including its director, set designers and actors ‚Äì influenced subsequent film production in Germany for many years, making teamwork a hallmark of German cinema in the Weimar Republic. The effect of Caligari was felt not just in German cinema, but internationally as well. Both Rotha and film historian William K. Everson wrote that the film probably had as much of a long-term effect on Hollywood directors as Battleship Potemkin (1925). In his book The Film Til Now, Rotha wrote that Caligari and Potemkin were the \\"two most momentous advances in the development of the cinema\\", and said Caligari \\"served to attract to the cinema audience many people who had hitherto regarded the film as the low watermark of intelligence\\". Caligari influenced the style and content of Hollywood films in the 1920s and early 1930s, particularly in films such as The Bells (1926), The Man Who Laughs (1928) and Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), and had a major influence on American horror films of the 1930s, some of which featured an antagonist using Caligari-like supernatural abilities to control others, such as Dracula (1931), Svengali (1931) and The Mad Genius (1931). Kaes said both Caligari's stylistic elements, and the Cesare character in particular, influenced the Universal Studios horror films of the 1930s, which often prominently featured some sort of monster, such as Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Black Cat (1934), and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). The Expressionism of Caligari also influenced American avant-garde film, particularly those that used fantastic settings to illustrate an inhuman environment overpowering an individual. Early examples include The Fall of the House of Usher (1928), The Last Moment (1928) and The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra (1928). LoBrutto wrote, \\"Few films throughout motion picture history have had more influence on the avant-garde, art, and student cinema than Caligari\\". Caligari and German Expressionism heavily influenced the American film noir period of the 1940s and '50s, both in visual style and narrative tone. Noir films tended to portray everyone, even the innocent, as the object of suspicion, a common thread in Caligari. The genre also employs several Expressionistic elements in its dark and shadowy visual style, stylized and abstract photography, and distorted and expressive make-up and acting. Caligari also influenced films produced in the Soviet Union, such as Aelita (1924) and The Overcoat (1926). Observers have noted the black and white films of Ingmar Bergman bear a resemblance to the German films of the 1920s, and film historian Roy Armes has called him \\"the true heir\\" of Caligari. Bergman himself, however, has downplayed the influence of German Expressionism on his work. Caligari has also affected stage theatre. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the film's use of the iris shot has been mimicked in theatrical productions, with lighting used to single out a lone actor. Caligari continues to be one of the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic. Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its effect on cinema as a whole: Siegfried Kracauer's From Caligari to Hitler (1947) and Lotte Eisner's The Haunted Screen (1974). From Caligari to Hitler based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called Caligari: The Story of a Famous Story, which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of Caligari. Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer's book: \\"Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has Caligari, and Weimar cinema generally, through Kracauer's social- psychological approach\\". Prior to the publication of From Caligari to Hitler, few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film, but Kracauer's argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler drastically changed attitudes about Caligari. Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced, even by those who have strongly disagreed with his general premise, and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven, such as his statement that the original script included no frame story. Eisner's book, meanwhile, placed Caligari into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s. Film historian David Robinson claimed Wiene, despite being the director of Caligari, is often given the least amount of credit for its production. He believes this is in part because Wiene died in 1938, closer to the release of the film than any other major collaborators, and was therefore unable to defend his involvement in the work while others took credit. In fact, Robinson argues Caligari ultimately hurt Wiene's reputation because his subsequent films did not match its success, so he is often wrongly considered \\"a one-film director\\" for whom Caligari was \\"a lucky fluke\\". Themes and interpretations =Authority and conformity= Caligari, like a number of Weimar films that followed it, thematizes brutal and irrational authority by making a violent and possibly insane authority figure its antagonist. Kracauer said Caligari was symbolic of the German war government and fatal tendencies inherent in the German system, saying the character \\"stands for an unlimited authority that idolizes power as such, and, to satisfy its lust for domination, ruthlessly violates all human rights and values\\". Likewise, John D. Barlow described Caligari as an example of the tyrannical power and authority that had long plagued Germany, while Cesare represents the \\"common man of unconditional obedience\\". Janowitz has claimed Cesare represents the common citizen who is conditioned to kill or be killed, just as soldiers are trained during their military service, and that Caligari is symbolic of the German government sending those soldiers off to die in the war. The control Caligari yields over the minds and actions of others results in chaos and both moral and social perversion. Cesare lacks any individuality and is simply a tool of his master; Barlow writes that he is so dependent on Caligari that he falls dead when he strays too far from the source of his sustenance, \\"like a machine that has run out of fuel\\". In his book From Caligari to Hitler, Kracauer argues the Caligari character is symptomatic of a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, which he calls the German \\"collective soul\\". Kracauer argues Caligari and Cesare are premonitions of Adolf Hitler and his rule over Germany, and that his control over the weak-willed, puppet-like somnambulist prefigures aspects of the mentality that allowed the Nazi Party to rise. He calls Caligari's use of hypnotism to impose his will foreshadowing of Hitler's \\"manipulation of the soul\\". Kracauer described the film as an example of Germany's obedience to authority and failure or unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority, and reflects a \\"general retreat\\" into a shell that occurred in post-war Germany. Cesare symbolizes those who have no mind of their own and must follow the paths of others; Kracauer wrote he foreshadows a German future in which \\"self-appointed Caligaris hypnotized innumerable Cesares into murder\\". Barlow rejects Kracauer's claims that the film glorifies authority \\"just because it has not made a preachy statement against it\\", and said the connection between Caligari and Hitler lies in the mood the film conveys, not an endorsement of such tyrant on the film's part. Everyday reality in Caligari is dominated by tyrannical aspects. Authorities sit atop high perches above the people they deal with and hold offices out of sight at the end of long, forbidding stairways. Most of the film's characters are caricatures who fit neatly into prescribed social roles, such as the outraged citizens chasing a public enemy, the authoritarian police who are deferential to their superiors, the oft- harassed bureaucratic town clerk, and the asylum attendants who act like stereotypical \\"little men in white suits\\". Only Caligari and Cesare are atypical of social roles, instead serving as, in Barlow's words, \\"abstractions of social fears, the incarnations of demonic forces of a nightmarish world the bourgeoisie was afraid to acknowledge, where self-assertion is pushed to willful and arbitrary power over others\\". Kracauer wrote the film demonstrates a contrast between the rigid control, represented by such characters as Caligari and the town clerk, and chaos, represented by the crowds of people at the fair and the seemingly never-ending spinning of the merry-go-rounds. He said the film leaves no room for middle ground between these two extremes, and that viewers are forced to embrace either insanity or authoritarian rigidity, leaving little space for human freedom. Kracauer writes: \\"Caligari exposes the soul wavering between tyranny and chaos, and facing a desperate situation: any escape from tyranny seems to throw it into a state of utter confusion\\". Caligari is not the only symbol of arrogant authority in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare can be seen as a rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Caligari in the asylum. Francis expresses a resentment of all forms of authority, particularly during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything wrong with him. Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: \\"The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman.\\" Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an \\"instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen\\" because commercial films had to \\"answer to mass desires\\". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracauer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him. =Point of view and perception of reality= Another major theme of Caligari is, Stephen Brockmann writes, \\"the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, and hence the destabilization of the very notion of sanity itself\\". By the end of the film, according to Brockman, viewers realize the story they have been watching has been told from the perspective of an insane narrator, and therefore they cannot accept anything they have seen as reliable. The film's unusual visual abstractions and other stylized elements serve to show the world as one experienced by a madman. Similarly, the film has been described as portraying the story as a nightmare and the frame story as the real world. John D. Barlow said the film exemplifies a common Expressionist theme that \\"the ultimate perception of reality will appear distorted and insane to the healthy and practical mind\\". The film serves as a reminder that any story told through a flashback subjectivizes the story from the perspective of the narrator. At the end of the film, the asylum director gives no indication that he means Francis ill will, and in fact he seems, to Barlow, to truly care for his patients. But Francis nevertheless believes he is being persecuted, so in the story as told from his perspective, Caligari takes on the role of persecutor. However, the Expressionistic visual elements of the film are present not only in the main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality. For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative. If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either. Instead, the film offers no true or normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis. As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane. Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy. In Brockman's words, \\"In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance\\". Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a \\"dream logic of repetition\\" that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality. Beyond Francis's individual circumstances, the use of the narrator's perspective in Dr. Caligari can be seen as reflective of a worldview of the screenwriters. Mayer and Janowitz were pacifists opposed to what Eisner described as the willingness of Germans to commit themselves to the dark forces, such as demoniac magic and supernatural powers, that led to death on the battlefield. Although he does not think it possible to reduce the narrative or the film to the beliefs of its makers, Eisner claims Francis can be seen as embodying the politics of Expressionism's anti-naturalism, through which a protagonist does not see the world objectively, but has \\"visions\\" that are abstracted from individuality and psychology. The framing device of an insane asylum, for Eisner, has a broader connotation as a statement on social reality in the context of the \\"state of exception\\". Here, Eisner claims, the militarist and imperialist tendency of monopoly capitalism is combined with what Sigmund Freud would later refer to as the longing for protection by a tyrannical father figure, or what Kracauer characterized as \\"asocial authority\\". =Double life= Duality is another common theme in Caligari. Caligari is portrayed in the main narrative as an insane tyrant, and in the frame story as a respected authority and director of a mental institution. As a result of this duality, it is possible for the viewer to suspect a malevolent aspect of him at the conclusion of the film, even despite evidence indicating he is a kind and caring man. Even within the main narrative alone, Caligari lives a double life: holding a respectable position as the asylum director, but becoming a hypnotist and murderer at night. Additionally, the character is actually a double of the \\"real\\" Caligari, an 18th-century mystic whom the film character becomes so obsessed with that he desires to penetrate his innermost secrets and \\"become Caligari\\". Francis also takes on a double life of sorts, serving as the heroic protagonist in the main narrative and a patient in a mental institution in the frame story. Anton Kaes described the story Francis tells as an act of transference with his psychiatrist, as well as a projection of his feelings that he is a victim under the spell of the all-powerful asylum director, just as Cesare is the hypnotized victim of Caligari. The Cesare character serves as both a persecutor and a victim, as he is both a murderer and the unwilling slave of an oppressive master. Siegfried Kracauer said by coupling a fantasy in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority with a reality in which authority triumphs over Francis, Caligari reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it. A contrast between levels of reality exists not only in the characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well. This, Barlow writes, \\"reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos\\". For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Caligari and Cesare. The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is especially prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes. =Reflection on post-war Germany= Critics have suggested that Caligari highlights some of the neuroses prevalent in Germany and the Weimar Republic when the film was made, particularly in the shadow of World War I, at a time when extremism was rampant, reactionaries still controlled German institutions, and citizens feared the harm the Treaty of Versailles would have on the economy. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the paranoia and fear portrayed in the film were signs of things to come in Germany, and that the film reflected a tendency in Germans to \\"retreat into themselves\\" and away from political engagement following the war. Vincent LoBrutto wrote that the film can be seen as a social or political analogy of \\"the moral and physical breakdown of Germany at the time, with a madman on the loose wreaking havoc on a distorted and off-balanced society, a metaphor for a country in chaos\\". Anton Kaes, who called Caligari \\"an aggressive statement about war psychiatry, murder and deception\\", wrote that Alan's question to Cesare, \\"How long have I to live?\\" reflected the trauma German citizens experienced during the war, as that question was often on the minds of soldiers and of family members back home concerned about their loved ones in the military. Francis's despair after Alan's murder can likewise be compared to that of the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield. Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences, noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn, a common time for attacks during the war. Thomas Elsaesser called Caligari an \\"outstanding example of how 'fantastic' representations in German films from the early 1920s seem to bear the imprint of pressures from external events, to which they refer only through the violence with which they disguise and disfigure them\\". Sequels, remakes and musical works =Film= Several unsuccessful attempts were made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following Caligari's release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to Caligari from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French surrealist style. In 1944, Erich Pommer and Hans Janowitz each separately attempted to obtain the legal rights to the film, with hopes of a Hollywood remake. Pommer attempted to argue he had a better claim to the rights because the primary value of the original film came not from the writing, but \\"in the revolutionary way the picture was produced\\". However, both Janowitz and Pommer ran into complications related to the invalidity of Nazi law in the United States, and uncertainty over the legal rights of sound and silent films. Janowitz wrote a treatment for a remake, and in January 1945 was offered a minimum guarantee of $16,000 against a five-percent royalty for his rights to the original film for a sequel to be directed by Fritz Lang, but the project never came to fruition. Later, Janowitz planned a sequel called Caligari II, and unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property to a Hollywood producer for $30,000. Around 1947, Hollywood agent Paul Kohner and German filmmaker Ernst Matray also planned a Caligari sequel; Matray and his wife Maria Solveg wrote a screenplay called The Return of Caligari. That script would have reimagined Caligari as a former Nazi officer and war criminal, but the film was never produced. In 1960, independent Hollywood producer Robert Lippert acquired the rights to Caligari from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called The Cabinet of Caligari, which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch did not intend to write a Caligari remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her at the end of the film. A quasi-sequel, called Dr. Caligari, was released in 1989, directed by Stephen Sayadian and starring Madeleine Reynal as the granddaughter of the original Caligari, now running an asylum and performing bizarre hormonal experiments on its patients. The sex-driven story ultimately had little in common with the original film. In 1992, theatre director Peter Sellars released his only feature film, The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez, an experimental film loosely based on Caligari. However, the storyline was created as the film was being made, so it has few similarities with the original film. The film was screened only at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and never theatrically released. An independent film remake of Caligari edited, written and directed by David Lee Fisher was released in 2005, in which new actors were placed in front of the actual backdrops from the original film. The actors performed in front of a green screen, then their performances were superimposed in front of matte shots based on the original sets. Doug Jones played the role of Cesare. =Music and stage= Numerous musicians have composed new scores to accompany the film. The Club Foot Orchestra premiered a score penned by ensemble founder and artistic director Richard Marriott in 1987. The Israeli Electronica group TaaPet composed a soundtrack for the film and performed it several times through Israel in 2000. The British composer and musician Geoff Smith composed a new soundtrack for the film in 2003. The Dutch psychedelic band Monomyth composed a new score and performed it during a screening of Caligari at the Imagine Film Festival in the Netherlands in April 2016. Bertelsmann/BMG commissioned Timothy Brock to adapt his 1996 score for string orchestra for a 2014 restoration; Brock conducted the premiere in Brussels on 15 September 2014. In 2012, the Chatterbox Audio Theatre recorded a live soundtrack, including dialogue, sound effects, and music for Caligari, which was released on YouTube on 30 October 2013. Two new scores were recorded for a 2016 DVD release of Caligari: a traditional score by Timothy Brock performed by the Brussels Philharmonic, and an electroacoustic score by Edison Studio, a collective of composers. In 1981, Bill Nelson was asked by the Yorkshire Actors Company to create a soundtrack for a stage adaptation of the film. That music was later recorded for his 1982 album Das Kabinet (The Cabinet Of Doctor Caligari). Caligari was adapted into an opera in 1997 by composer John Moran. It premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a production by Robert McGrath. Joseph Kahn and Rob Zombie directed a music video for the 1999 single \\"Living Dead Girl\\" with imagery directly inspired by The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie playing the Cesare part. In 2015, Indian scenographer and director Deepan Sivaraman adapted the film into an hour-long mixed-media piece with the performance studies students at Ambedkar University Delhi as part of a course entitled \\"Space and Spectatorship\\". Scottish Opera's Connect Company commissioned composer Karen MacIver and librettist Allan Dunn to produce an opera based on The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which was first performed in 2016. Though it shared the same story as the film, the setting was changed to Glasgow Green and Gartloch in Glasgow, Scotland. In 2020, Spanish post-rock band Toundra has released their own soundtrack to the movie. It has been released exactly 100 years after the original film premiere. The album consists of 7 songs, which match the film structure - opening title sequenz, plus six film acts. The songs are also the same length as the acts, so the music can be played along the film, perfectly synchronizing. The whole movie with the music can be seen on Vimeo platform, with original, and Spanish subtitles. =Audio adaptations= In 1998, an audio adaptation of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari written and directed by Yuri Rasovsky was released by Tangled Web Audio on audio cassette. The cast included John de Lancie, Kaitlin Hopkins, and Robertson Dean. The dramatization won the Independent Publisher Book Award for Best Direct-to- Audio Production in 1998. In 2008, BBC Radio 3 broadcast an audio adaptation by Amanda Dalton entitled Caligari, starring Luke Treadaway, Tom Ferguson, Sarah McDonald Hughes, Terence Mann, and countertenor Robin Blaze as Cesare. Caligari was an entirely silent character in this adaptation.

It is a unit of Bard College, which was founded in 1860 and is located nearby, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. The school is an \\"early college\\", designed for students to enroll immediately after completing the tenth or eleventh grade, rather than after graduating from high school. Simon's Rock is the only accredited four-year early college to date and still the singular college or university to take this approach with all of its students. It is one of a number of early college entrance programs that provide opportunities for students to enter college one or more years ahead of their traditional high school graduation date. A majority of students transfer to larger institutions after receiving an Associate of Arts degree after two years, although many stay for four to receive a Bachelor of Arts. History The college's founder, Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, had formerly been a private girls' school headmistress at Concord Academy. She concluded from her experience, and that of her colleagues, that for many students the latter two years of high school are wasted on repetitious and overly constrained work. Many young students, she thought, are ready to pursue college-level academic work some time before the usual system asks it of them. When envisioning the college in the early 1960s, Elizabeth Blodgett Hall deliberately named it nothing more than \\"Simon's Rock.\\" Her reasoning for this was that even she didn't know if it would be a high school, a college, or something else. Kellogg Music Center Simon's Rock was officially founded in 1964. From 1964 to 1970, the buildings of the campus were built on Great Pine Farm, a farm that was owned by Hall's family. These buildings were the college center, the library, the classroom buildings, three dormitories (now dormitories primarily for first-year students: Crosby, Dolliver, and Kendrick) and the dining hall. Some of the farm's buildings, such as Hall's own home, were incorporated into the college campus as well. Hall was the president of the college at its founding. In 1966, the first class, all women, were admitted to Simon's Rock. These women, along with some of the other early classes, went through a four-year program that resulted in the associate's degree, at which point students desiring a further degree would have to transfer to another school. This differs from the current system, in which students receive an associate degree typically after two years, and a bachelor's degree after four years of study. The year 1970 saw both the first commencement ceremonies at Simon's Rock as well as the first coeducational entering class. Hall retired as Simon's Rock's president in 1972 after students organized a vote of no confidence, handing the post off to Baird W. Whitlock, whose presidency ended in 1977. Though only serving for five years, Whitlock was very influential to Simon's Rock's development. He oversaw a complete change in the associate's program, which was condensed into two years, eliminating the high school components. He also oversaw the beginning of the bachelor's degree program, which was accredited in 1974 by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Samuel McGill was Simon's Rock's president from 1977 to 1979, at which point Bard College became affiliated with Simon's Rock. The acquisition was completed as an attempt to bring Simon's Rock out of the major financial struggle it was experiencing. At the time that Simon's Rock was looking for a school to acquire it, some of the possible schools included Boston University and Yale University. The Bard acquisition took about one month from start to finish. This made Leon Botstein, the president of Bard, the ex officio president of Simon's Rock, and he still holds both offices today. In 1981, with the help of various donors, Simon's Rock purchased the Upper Campus, a former seminary three-quarters of a mile uphill from the original Simon's Rock campus. This added a gymnasium, chapel and various forms of housing to Simon's Rock's assets. In 1989, an arts and humanities building was built directly across Alford Road, near the college's other arts buildings. In the same year, the student union was established in the lower level of the dining hall. On December 14, 1992, a shooting occurred at Simon's Rock College. At around 10:30 pm, Wayne Lo, a student at the school, shot and killed one student and one professor, and wounded three students and a security guard. His SKS rifle soon jammed and Lo later surrendered to authorities without further incident. The people killed in the shooting were 18-year-old Galen Gibson and 37-year-old √ëacu√±√°n Saez. In 1993, the then-unused chapel from upper campus was relocated to the main part of campus and renovated, becoming the college's music building. That same year, a number of the campus's arts and dormitory buildings were also renovated. Since then, many buildings have been built or renovated. These include the Fisher Science and Academic Center (completed 1998), the Kilpatrick Athletic Center (completed 1999), the Daniel Arts Center (completed 2005), an apartment-like dormitory for upperclassmen (Pibly House, completed 2000), the Livingston Hall Student Union (completed 2006), and others. In 2000, Simon's Rock became the first college in the United States to officially recognize International Workers' Day. In 2001, Simon's Rock was instrumental in the founding of Bard High School Early College (BHSEC) in Manhattan. There are now seven Bard Early College programs located in New York, Newark, Cleveland, Baltimore, and New Orleans. On April 11, 2006, part of Carriage House, a residence in upper campus, burned in an electrical fire in the early morning. No one was hurt in the incident, but some student possessions were partially or entirely destroyed. The remnants of the building were burnt down by the Great Barrington Fire Department in January 2009 in a training exercise. In 2015, Simon's Rock founded Bard Academy at Simon's Rock, a two- year high school program leading into the Lower College program. Location Simon's Rock is located on a 275-acre (1.1-km¬≤) campus in Great Barrington, a small town (pop. 7,500) in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts. The town of Great Barrington is neighbored by the towns of Lee, Stockbridge and West Stockbridge to the north, Alford and Egremont to the west, Sheffield and New Marlborough to the south, and Monterey and Tyringham to the east. Academics Faculty at Bard College at Simon's Rock are primarily appointed to one of the following four academic divisions: the Division of the Arts, the Division of Languages and Literature, the Division of Science, Mathematics and Computing, and the Division of Social Studies. Students may also hold one of several concentrations available under Interdivisional Studies. Over 40 concentrations are available, including art history, Asian studies, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and theater. The school offers study abroad and independent study opportunities, as well as a 3/2 dual-degree program with Columbia University for those who wish to pursue engineering. Similar programs are available with Dartmouth College and Washington University in St. Louis. Students are encouraged to spend one or more terms at Lincoln College or St Catherine's College in the University of Oxford, or at other institutions during their time as a Simon's Rock enrollee. While many students receive associate degrees after two years and transfer to other institutions, around half stay and moderate into the Simon's Rock B.A. program. Those who wish to remain eligible for a bachelor's degree must complete senior theses, which become professionally printed, archived, and remain available to the public in the Alumni Library. Classes are discussion-oriented, with lecture based offerings. The system is predicated on the idea that the students bring as much value to the class as the professors. In fact, orientation for incoming students is a mandatory week-long writing and thinking workshop, designed to readjust students to pedagogical, cooperative bidirectional learning. It is a school policy that teachers are referred to on a first-name basis. For example, students don't refer to the former dean as \\"Dr. Bernard Rodgers,\\" but instead call him \\"Bernie.\\" Professors never receive tenure as a matter of policy. There are only about 400 students (though due to its small size, large fluctuations in class enrollment and admissions are common), resulting in a very low student-to-faculty ratio, around 8:1. Few classes have more than 15 students; none have more than 30. Some classes have as few as three students, and independent study or tutorial courses in which one student works closely with a professor are common. Student life =Athletics= The llama is the mascot of Bard College at Simon's Rock, due to the proximity of the college football fields to Seekonk Veterinary Hospital, a veterinary clinic that, at one time, had a llama pasture. Interscholastic sports offered at the school include football, basketball, and swimming. All students at Simon's Rock are required to fulfill athletic requirements through the Active Community Engagement (ACE) Program. ACE courses include traditional gym classes, such as martial arts, swimming lessons, weight training, and so on, but extend to things like bowling, dodgeball, hackeysack, gardening, and scuba diving. =Housing= The vast majority of students at Simon's Rock live on-campus, and all students (except those with local families) are required to live on- campus during their first two years, with some exceptions. Nine dormitories are currently used to house students. * Crosby House is a women's dormitory. * Dolliver House is a men's dormitory. * Kendrick House is a coeducational dormitory. Crosby, Dolliver and Kendrick are known as the \\"Tri- Dorms.\\" They are predominantly for first-year students. * Hill House is a coeducational dormitory for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A portion of Hill house is used to home the students of Bard Academy. Pibly House, Carriage House, and The Cottage are on Upper Campus, a portion of the campus that is about 3/4-mile uphill from the main section of the campus. Other buildings on Upper Campus include the provost's house and the Annex (a small building that houses staff). * Carriage House is a relatively new dormitory, built in 2009 on the site where the former Carriage House stood. The majority of Carriage House was destroyed in a fire in 2005, and the remains stood until 2009. The remnants of the building were burnt down by the Great Barrington Fire Department as a training exercise. The new dormitory is primarily used for sophomores and some upperclassmen. * Pibly House is a coeducational dormitory, consisting of eight two- or three-bedroom apartments for juniors and seniors. *The Annex has a single coeducational four-bedroom apartment for juniors and seniors. It was used as student housing in 2008-2009 and opened to students again starting in 2015. * The Owl's Nest, formerly a gathering space for students belonging to minority identity groups or organizations, came into use to house students in the Fall 2016 semester due to high housing demand. * The Cottage has been used as coeducational housing for three to five non-first-year students since 2007. Before 2007, it was mainly used for staff members. Several dormitories are no longer in use as student housing, and Simon's Rock has used many other buildings as student housing over the years. * The Foster Houses (colloquially known as \\"The Mods\\") are a set of 12 townhouses, each built to house four non- first-year students. After the 2010‚Äì2011 academic year the Foster Houses were closed for long-term renovation, The Mods reopened for students housing in the fall of 2017. * The Orchard Houses can each house five to seven non-first- years. Of the three that were built, two currently house staff members and their families. Orchard 3, is currently used to house upperclassmen students. * Red Brick House and Checker Chance are two dorms that housed small numbers of non-first year students in house style during 2008‚Äì2009. They are located across the street from the main section of campus, on Hurlburt road. Use of these houses was discontinued during the 2009‚Äì2010 school year. * During the Fall 2008 semester the College also provided overflow student housing at the nearby Days Inn hotel. Name Simon's Rock The name \\"Simon's Rock\\" comes from a large rock, a glacial erratic, currently in the woods on the campus, a short walk from the main part of the campus. At the time that Simon's Rock earned its name (in the early 1920s), the woods that now surround it were part of the vast area of land called Great Pine Farm.

The 126 film cartridge. 126 film is a cartridge-based film format used in still photography. It was introduced by Kodak in 1963, and is associated mainly with low-end point-and-shoot cameras, particularly Kodak's own Instamatic series of cameras. Although 126 was once very popular, it is no longer manufactured, and few photofinishers will process it.  History and technical details  A photo of the Holburne Museum of Art, Bath, taken with 126 film and illustrating the square format. In 1963, Kodak introduced a new film, encased in a plastic cartridge, for which they re-introduced the \\"126\\" designation. (The number was originally used for the unrelated 126 roll film format from 1906 to 1949). The term \\"126\\" was intended to show that images were 26 mm square, using Kodak's common 1xx film numbering system. However the image size is actually 28√ó28 mm, but usually reduced to approximately 26.5√ó26.5 mm by masking during printing or mounting. The 126 film format was defined in ISO 3029, which has since been withdrawn. Like the 120 format, there is a continuous backing paper, and the frame number is visible through a small window at the rear of the cartridge. Cameras for this type of film are equipped with a large rectangular window in the back door, through which is visible not only the frame number, but also a portion of the label showing the film type and speed. The cartridge has a captive take-up spool, but no supply spool: the film and backing paper are simply coiled tightly and placed in the supply end of the cartridge. The positioning of the image is fixed by the cartridge. The film is 35 mm wide, but unlike 135 film, it is unperforated, except for one registration hole per image, similar to the earlier 828 film. The camera is equipped with a sensing pin which falls into this hole when the film is fully advanced to the next frame, at which point the winding knob or lever is locked, so as to prevent winding past the pre-exposed frame lines. A strip of 126 negatives, showing the square format and single perforation. The film is pre-exposed with frame lines and numbers, a feature intended to make printing and viewing easier. The top edge of the cartridge above the film gate has a square notch in a specific position corresponding to the speed of the film in the cartridge. Some of the higher-end cameras used this notch to determine the correct exposure, or to set the light meter, if so equipped. Although only film with speeds between ISO 64/19¬∞ and ISO 400/27¬∞ were ever manufactured in this format, the standard defined 20 different speeds, from ISO 20/14¬∞ to ISO 1600/33¬∞. The film was originally available in 12 and 20 image lengths; at the time regular production stopped it was only available in 24 exposure cartridges. The film does not need to be rewound, and is very simple to load and unload. 126 Roll of Dynapan B&W; film (expired: February 1969) The format was introduced by Kodak under the brand name Kodapak, together with the Instamatic camera. Although the Instamatic name is sometimes treated as synonymous with the 126 format, Kodak also used it on its later 110-format cameras, which they called Pocket Instamatic and on its \\"M\\" series 8 mm movie cameras. Around ten million cameras were made by Kodak and other companies. However, with a few exceptions, the format was mainly used for fairly simple amateur cameras. (Makers of the few high-end models included Kodak, Minolta, Rollei, Yashica and Zeiss Ikon.) Kodak officially discontinued the format on 31 December 1999.  Current availability and usage  Ferrania in Italy, was the last factory producing 126 film. Their product was an ISO 200 colour print film marketed under their Solaris brand. The last scheduled production run took place in April 2007, but an unscheduled production run in late 2007 surprised industry observers and raised hopes that it had not actually been discontinued. Ferrania's subsequent bankruptcy meant that there was no longer any large-scale factory source for 126 film. Unused, outdated 126 films continue to show up at thrift stores, estate sales, and online auctions. Unless they have been stored frozen, they are probably deteriorated and are suitable only for experimenting. Amateur photographers sometimes salvage the plastic cartridge and backing paper from outdated 126 films and reload them with fresh 35mm film. The process is not difficult, but it is not entirely practical since the two films have significantly different perforations. 126 cameras have a film-advance mechanism that relies on one edge perforation per image, and 35mm camera film has eight perforations per image, on both edges of the film. The photographer must use the film-advance mechanism several times between images, and one edge of each image will have visible perforations. Because it is 35 mm wide and is developed in industry- standard C-41 process chemistry, processing of 126 films is readily available, as long as the photofinisher knows that it is standard, 35 mm, C-41 film. Printing the photos can present problems, because modern film processing equipment often cannot handle the square format of 126 film. Some specialist photographic printers can correctly handle it. Standard flatbed scanners that have a light source for scanning film can be used to scan 126 negatives, perhaps using a mask made with black paper. Note that older film may require other processes such as C-22.

It was introduced by Kodak in 1972. 110 is essentially a miniaturized version of Kodak's earlier 126 film format. Each frame is , with one registration hole. Cartridges with 12, 20, or 24 frames are available on-line. Production variations sometimes have allowed for an additional image. The film is fully housed in a plastic cartridge, which also registers the image when the film is advanced. There is a continuous backing paper, and the frame number is visible through a window at the rear of the cartridge. The film does not need to be rewound and is very simple to load and unload. The film is usually pre-exposed with frame lines and numbers, a feature intended to make it easier and more efficient for photofinishers to print. Unlike later competing formats, such as disc and APS film, processed 110 negatives are returned in strips, without the original cartridge. Disc, 100, and 135 image size. History The 110 cartridge was introduced by Kodak in 1972 with Kodak Pocket Instamatic cameras with Kodachrome-X, Ektachrome-X, Kodacolor II, and Verichrome Pan film. The new pocket-sized cameras became immediately popular, and soon displaced competing subminiature cameras, such as the Minolta 16 series, from the market. The 110 film width is 16 mm. A four frame strip measures 111 mm. The 16 mm film width allowed Kodachrome film in 110 size to be processed on the existing processing machines that processed movie films in the Standard 8 mm film and 16 mm film sizes. Fujifilm stopped manufacturing 110 format film in September 2009. Lomography re-commenced 110 film production in 2011. and currently offers 110 Black and White(Orca), Colour negative(Tiger), Color slide film(Peacock), a purple-scale color negative(Lomochrome Purple) and a red-scale color negative film(Lobster.) Estes Industries has long marketed several model rockets, the most notable being the Astrocam, with a simple 110 camera in the nose; the shutter is triggered when the nose cone separates from the rocket body. Tyco (in their Spy Tech line of toys) made two toy spy cameras in the early 1990s that utilized 110 film, called the Hidden Camera and Reese's Camera. The Reese's Camera natively looked like a Reese's candy box, while the Hidden Camera came with a removable cardboard cover sleeve with small cutouts for the trigger button and front lens that made it resemble a Good & Plenty candy box. The Hidden Camera had a periscope-like attachment that used a mirror for taking pictures around corners or behind objects. The Hidden Camera's shape and size is similar to that of the Minox B. Design and technical issues Negative strip of 110 film (with pencil for scale). The strip shown measures A 110 cartridge of ISO 400 film. The arrow indicates the modification made so that sophisticated cameras detect the proper film speed Closeup of part of a 110 negative seen through a film scanner. Although the format is most closely associated with cheaply produced, low-cost cameras, Canon, Minolta, Minox, Pentax, Rollei, Voigtl√§nder, and others, as well as Kodak, offered sophisticated, expensive 110 cameras, with excellent multi-element focusing lenses and precise, electronically controlled exposure systems. Such cameras are capable of making high-quality images on 110 film. Some of these cameras are quite small and still hold appeal to subminiature-photography enthusiasts. The small negative size of 110 film makes it difficult to enlarge successfully. For these reasons, the 110 format is associated with prints that are often rather grainy and unsharp. This has led to the misconception that the cartridge itself is incapable of holding film flat enough for making high- quality negatives. The 110 cartridge, as specified by Kodak, has a plastic tab on one end. Camera designers had the option of using this tab to sense film speed, enabling sophisticated cameras to switch between high- and low-speed film. A short tab indicated high-speed film, and a long tab indicated low- speed film. Kodak left it to the film manufacturer to decide which film speeds were high or low. Only a few cameras took advantage of this feature: Rollei A110, Canon 110 ED 20, Minolta 110 Zoom SLR Mark I/II, Minox 110S, Voigtlander Vitoret 110 EL, Pentax Auto 110 and the Kodak Ektralite 10. Some manufacturers would vary the low speed ASA setting and then change it in later models. For example, Minox 110S low speed was 64 ASA (Kodachrome then being made for 110) and high 400 ASA: but Canon 110 ED has 80 ASA only, with the 110 ED 20 having 80 and 400 ASA. Instructional Manuals: Canon 110 and Minox 110S The last 110 film that Kodak produced was ISO 400 speed packed in a cartridge that senses as \\"low\\" speed. As shown in the photograph to the right, these cartridges can be modified by hand so that they signal the proper speed to the camera. Film types Three mini slides from 110 film, along with the box they came in from the lab, the plastic slide holder that was inside the box, a standard-format slide adapter, and a battery-powered pocket slide viewer for the mini slides. Negative strip Although the format is commonly associated with print film, Kodak also produced Kodachrome 64 slide film in 110 cartridges until 1982.Marcus, Ted R., APS, 110, \\"Disc,\\" and Formats du Jour, Ted Marcus' Virtual Light Table.

In 2012 Lomography re- introduced slide film for 110 with their Peacock 200 ASA model. However, since not all 110 cameras have a settable ASA dial (low or high, depending on presence of a notch in the cassette), a neutral-density filter has to be used over the lens or the exposure compensation dial has to be used where available. Otherwise, over-exposure by a factor of x2 will result, leading to over-exposed images. Along with standard-sized slides that fit into standard projectors, 110 slide film could also be processed into smaller format slides. The latter requires special Pocket Carousel projectors. or the Leica 110 projector. The sub-miniature slides are mounted in small mounts, or for Kodachrome mounted in 35mm-sized mounts with a 110 frame. There are also mount adapters available that allow the small mounts to be projected in a common 35mm projector. These adapters were not entirely satisfactory however, as to project the smaller slide at a size comparable to that from 35mm the projector had to be moved further from the screen, resulting in a dimmer image. Dedicated 110 projectors overcame this by using a brighter lamp. Kodak's Verichrome Pan was the only 110 black and white film produced until 2012, when Lomography manufactured their new Black and White Orca film at 100 ISO speed. This speed is supported by most 110 cameras. As of 2020, this film is still in production.

Grokster Ltd. was rendered extinct in late 2005 by the United States Supreme Court's decision in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. The court ruled against Grokster's peer-to-peer file sharing program for computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, effectively forcing the company to cease operations. The product was similar in look and feel to Kazaa, marketed by Sharman Networks, and Morpheus, which was distributed by StreamCast. Grokster, along with Morpheus and Kazaa, are considered second-generation peer-to-peer file sharing programs. Unlike their predecessor Napster, these file sharing programs allowed users to trade files directly between one another, without these transactions passing through a centralized server. Because Napster maintained this fraction of control over the transaction of files through its server, it was ruled illegal because it should have exercised its power over the server to stop the sharing of copyright infringing files. Grokster and this second generation of peer-to- peer file sharing programs sought to avoid this legal obstacle.  A summary of the piracy argument  It has been estimated that 90% of files shared on Grokster were downloaded illegally. Whether such downloads have substantially affected the retail sales of music, videos, and other works protected by copyright and the intellectual property laws is a matter of debate. Grokster claimed they did not violate any copyright laws because no files passed through their computers. They assigned certain user computers as \\"root supernodes\\" that acted as music hubs for their company. Thus they were not responsible for controlling any specific file downloads. The key issue in the copyright infringement case was the so-called \\"Sony safe-harbor\\" principle that was set by the Supreme Court over 21 years previously in Sony v. Universal Studios 464 U.S. 417 (1984). The ruling stated that, \\"...the sale of copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial non-infringing uses\\" (Sony 464 U.S. at 442). This case challenged the legality of using VTRs to copy content using Betamax tapes. Grokster argued that proof of reasonable, actual or potential, non-infringing use, is sufficient to fulfill the \\"substantiality\\" requirement. The RIAA and MPAA argued that Sony safe-harbor requires proof that the non-infringing use is the primary one; an incidental non-infringing use is not enough. Among the amicus curiae briefs: * The U.S. government proposed that a manufacturer of a technological device will be protected by Sony safe-harbor only if the non- infringing uses are commercially significant compared to the infringing uses. * A group of law and economic professors (among them Professors Kenneth J. Arrow, and William M. Landes) argue that the test whether the non-infringing use is substantial, requires an examination of all the existing legal mechanisms for accomplishing the same task. The example given is the distribution of the Bible. This is lawfully available through peer-to-peer file sharing software and is therefore a non-infringing use. But many religious websites offer a free copy. Thus, since downloading the Bible through peer-to-peer file sharing software is an addition to the list of well- established legitimate methods for obtaining a free Bible, the benefits of this addition are not substantial and the overall use of P2P software should not be considered a non-infringing use. * The cost-benefit analysis, first introduced by Judge Posner from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Aimster case, holds that a manufacturer of technological device will enjoy the Sony safe-harbor only if \\"...it would have been disproportionately costly for him to eliminate or at least reduce substantially the infringing uses.\\" * The Creative Commons organization presented a strong argument for non-infringing use in the form of the Creative Commons licence, despite the fact that the architecture of the software did not allow for the licence information to be transferred. * Notable Emerging Technology Companies with the support of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (among them Kaleidescape, Inc. (CEO Michael Malcolm), Sling Media, Inc. (Founder Raghu Tarra), Time Trax Technologies Corp. (CEO Elliott Frutkin) argued unwarranted alteration of the test set forth in Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984), that would have profound negative consequences for emerging technology companies. Determining a product‚Äôs \\"primary uses\\" necessarily requires evaluating how the product is actually used. This ex post, or after-the-fact, test for contributory infringement would greatly increase the legal uncertainty surrounding the decision to pursue commercialization of a new technology. Emerging technology companies cannot necessarily predict the \\"primary uses\\" to which their new technology will be put, much less whether those uses would be held by the courts to be infringing uses.  The history of the case in the U.S. courts  In April 2003, Los Angeles federal judge Stephen Wilson ruled in favor of Grokster and Streamcast (providers of Morpheus P2P software) against the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association of America and held that their file sharing software was not illegal. On 20 August 2003, the decision was appealed by the RIAA and the MPAA. On 17 August 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a partial ruling supporting Grokster, holding > This appeal presents the question of whether distributors of peer-to-peer > file-sharing networking software may be held contributorily or vicariously > liable for copyright infringements by users. Under the circumstances > presented by this case, we conclude that the defendants are not liable for > contributory and vicarious copyright infringement and affirm the district > court's partial grant of summary judgment. In December 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. On 25 March 2005, billionaire and former Broadcast.com owner Mark Cuban announced he would finance Grokster's fight in the Supreme Court. Oral arguments were held for MGM v. Grokster on 29 March 2005, and in June 2005, the court unanimously held that Grokster could indeed be sued for infringement for their activities prior to the date of this judgment. But the future impact of the case may only be to require software companies to more carefully advertise their packages to discourage illegal downloading (see also inducement rule). Grokster settled with plaintiffs shortly after the Supreme Court's decision. On 14 February 2006, the plaintiffs filed motions for summary judgment as to the liability of the remaining defendants, StreamCast and Sharman. Defendant Sharman Networks reached a tentative settlement agreement in August 2006. On 27 September 2006, Judge Steven Wilson of the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs as to StreamCast's liability. The court rejected StreamCast's argument that the plaintiff needs to show specific instances of infringement resulting from StreamCast's acts, holding that \\"Plaintiff need prove only that StreamCast distributed the product with the intent to encourage infringement.\\"2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73714 at *58  Supreme Court decision leads to shutdown  Grokster closed its site on November 7, 2005. A note on its home page cited a United States Supreme Court ruling that copying copyrighted material using \\"unauthorized peer-to-peer services is illegal\\" and while legal download services exist, \\"this service is not one of them.\\" The website is now threatening visitors that their actions can get them caught, displaying the visitor's IP address. The screen text reads as follows:  Impact of legal threats and fallout from Grokster‚Äôs demise  In the aftermath of the Grokster warning, many users became alarmed that their IP addresses were being stored. Prosecution of such individuals relies upon what has commonly been referred to as a process of doe subpoena in which prosecutors are required to gain a series of subpoenas in order to find out the identity of the user behind the IP address in question. Following the shutdown of Grokster, blogs became inundated with concerned users fearful of the warning; however, there have been no reports of the use of doe subpoenas in this case. Research into the effects of warnings such as the one left on Grokster‚Äôs website has shown that while these warnings can result in a substantial reduction in online file sharing of individuals, the overall availability of downloadable content did not diminish. Furthermore, researchers cannot account for how much of this reduction in individual file sharing is simply shifted to other file sharing programs. In cases where the RIAA has issued threats, the users who conduct the most file sharing usually reduced their daily transactions to levels below the level of prosecution. In effect, these warnings have only caused only a brief reduction in overall online file sharing. In popular culture *Weird Al Yankovic mentions Grokster in \\"Don't Download This Song\\".

He was a founding member of Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a journal whose name later became synonymous with the circle of artists collaborating in it. His mature works mostly depict animals, and are known for bright colouration. He was drafted to serve in the German Army at the beginning of World War I, and died two years later at the Battle of Verdun. In the 1930s, the Nazis named him a degenerate artist as part of their suppression of modern art. However, most of his work survived World War II, securing his legacy. His work is now exhibited in many eminent galleries and museums. When up for auction, his major paintings attract large sums, with a record of ¬£12,340,500 ($24,376,190) for Weidende Pferde III (Grazing Horses III).  Early life  Franz Marc was born in 1880 in Munich, the then capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria. His father, Wilhelm Marc, was a professional landscape painter; his mother, Sophie, was a homemaker and a devout, socially liberal Calvinist. At the age of 17 Marc wanted to study theology, as his older brother Paul had. Two years later, however, he enrolled in the arts program of Munich University. He was first required to serve in the military for a year, after which, in 1900, he began studies instead at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where his teachers included Gabriel von Hackl and Wilhelm von Diez. In 1903 and 1907, he spent time in France, particularly in Paris, visiting the museums in the city and copying many paintings, a traditional way for artists to study and develop technique. In Paris, Marc frequented artistic circles, meeting numerous artists and the actress Sarah Bernhardt. He discovered a strong affinity for the work of painter Vincent van Gogh. After the 1903 trip, he ceased attending the Academy of Fine Arts. During his 20s, Marc was involved in a number of stormy relationships, including an affair lasting for many years with Annette Von Eckardt, a married antique dealer nine years his senior. He married twice, first to Marie Schn√ºr, then to Maria Franck; both were artists.  Career  Blaues Pferd I, Blue Horse I (1911) In 1906, Marc traveled with his elder brother Paul, a Byzantine expert, to Thessaloniki, Mount Athos, and various other Greek locations. A few years later, in 1910, Marc developed an important friendship with the artist August Macke. In 1910 Marc painted Nude with Cat and Grazing Horses, and showed works in the second exhibition of the Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung (New Artists' Association, of which Marc was briefly a member) at the Thannhauser Galleries in Munich.Klaus H. Carl and Franz Marc, Franz Marc, Parkstone Press 2013 = Der Blaue Reiter = In 1911, Marc founded the Der Blaue Reiter journal, which became the center of an artist circle, along with Macke, Wassily Kandinsky, and others who had decided to split off from the Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung movement. Though Marc showed several of his works in the first Der Blaue Reiter exhibition at the Thannhauser Galleries in Munich between December 1911 and January 1912, as it was the apex of the German expressionist movement, the exhibit also showed in Berlin, Cologne, Hagen, and Frankfurt. In 1912, Marc met Robert Delaunay, whose use of color and the futurist method was a major influence on Marc's work; fascinated by futurism and cubism, Marc created art that increasingly was stark in nature, painting natural abstract forms which found spiritual value in color. He painted The Tiger and Red Deer in 1912 and The Tower of Blue Horses, Foxes, and Fate of the Animals in 1913. = Wartime = The military person's estate of Franz Marc on display in a museum With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Marc was drafted into the Imperial German Army as a cavalryman. By February 1916, as shown in a letter to his wife, he had gravitated to military camouflage. His technique for hiding artillery from aerial observation was to paint canvas covers in broadly pointillist style. He took pleasure in creating a series of nine such tarpaulin covers in styles varying \\"from Manet to Kandinsky\\", suspecting that the latter could be the most effective against aircraft flying at 2000 meters or higher. After mobilization of the German Army, the government identified notable artists to be withdrawn from combat for their own safety. Marc was on the list but was struck in the head and killed instantly by a shell splinter during the Battle of Verdun in 1916 before orders for reassignment could reach him.Dantini, Michele, Modern & Contemporary Art, (Sterling Publishing Inc., 2008), 29.  Style  The Large Blue Horses (1911) Marc made some sixty prints in woodcut and lithography. Most of his mature work portrays animals,Cooper, Philip. Cubism. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 98. usually in natural settings. His work is characterized by bright primary color, an almost cubist portrayal of animals, stark simplicity and a profound sense of emotion. Even in his own time, his work attracted notice in influential circles. Marc gave an emotional meaning or purpose to the colors he used in his work: blue was used to portray masculinity and spirituality, yellow represented feminine joy, and red encased the sound of violence. After the National Socialists took power, they suppressed modern art; in 1936 and 1937, the Nazis condemned the late Marc as an entarteter K√ºnstler (degenerate artist) and ordered approximately 130 of his works removed from exhibition in German museums. His painting Landscape With Horses was discovered in 2012 along with more than a thousand other paintings, in the Munich apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt whose dealer father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was a collector of Modernist art the Nazis called \\"degenerate\\". One of Marc's best-known paintings is Tierschicksale (Animal Destinies or Fate of the Animals), which hangs in the Kunstmuseum Basel. Marc had completed the work in 1913, when \\"the tension of impending cataclysm had pervaded society\\", as one art historian noted.Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages. 2008, page 916 On the rear of the canvas, Marc wrote, \\"Und Alles Sein ist flammend Leid\\" (\\"And all being is flaming agony\\").Rookmaaker, Hendrik Roelof. Modern Art and the Death of a Culture. 1994, page 136 Serving in World War I, Marc wrote to his wife about the painting, \\"[it] is like a premonition of this war - horrible and shattering. I can hardly conceive that I painted it.\\"  Legacy and honors  Plaque on the house where Marc was born Marc's family house in Munich is marked with a historical plaque. The Franz Marc Museum opened in 1986, and his dedicated to the artist life and work. It houses many of his paintings, and also works by other contemporary artists.Franz Marc Museum, Muenchen.De (German) In October 1998, several of Marc's paintings garnered record prices at Christie's art auction house in London, including Rote Rehe I (Red Deer I), which sold for $3.3 million. In October 1999, his Der Wasserfall (The Waterfall) was sold by Sotheby's in London for $5.06 million. This price set a record for Franz Marc's work and for twentieth-century German painting. In 2008, the former record was again broken when Marc's Weidende Pferde III (Grazing Horses III) was sold for ¬£12,340,500 ($24,376,190) at Sotheby's.

They were discovered in 1964 during a series of excavations at the site of ancient Pyrgi, on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy in Latium (Lazio). The text records the foundation of a temple and its dedication to the Etruscan supreme goddess Uni, who is identified with Astarte in the Phoenician text.

Two of the tablets are inscribed in the Etruscan language, the third in Phoenician.The specific dialect has been called \\"Mediterranean Phoenician\\" by Full bibliography of Pyrgi and the tablets The writings are important in providing both a bilingual text that allows researchers to use knowledge of Phoenician to interpret Etruscan, and evidence of Phoenician or Punic influence in the Western Mediterranean.

Catholics refer to it as deuterocanonical. Augustine (c. A.D. 397) and Pope Innocent I (A.D. 405) affirmed Tobit as part of the Old Testament Canon. Athanasius (A.D. 367) mentioned that certain other books, including the book of Tobit, while not being part of the Canon, \\"were appointed by the Fathers to be read\\". According to Rufinus of Aquileia (c. A.D. 400) the book of Tobit and other deuterocanonical books were not called Canonical but Ecclesiastical books. Tobit and Anna.

Historically evangelical Anglicans viewed it as worthy to be read and it is still read in churches. Many high church Anglicans view it as part of the canon of scripture. =In Judaism= Before the 1952 discovery of Aramaic and Hebrew fragments of Tobit among the Dead Sea Scrolls in a cave at Qumran, scholars believed Tobit was not included in the Jewish canon because of late authorship, estimated to A.D. 100.Fitzmyer, at p. 50, 55‚Äì57 Qumran fragments of the text, which were copied between 100 B.C. to A.D. 25, evidence a much earlier origin than previously thought. These fragments evidence authorship no later than the 2nd century BC and, likely, contemporary with the date ascribed, by modern scholars, to the final compilation of the Book of Daniel, which did attain canonical status.R. Glenn Wooden, \\"Changing Perceptions of Daniel: Reading Chapters 4 and 5 of Daniel\\", in From Biblical Criticism to Biblical Faith, Brackney & Evans eds., p. 10 (Mercer Univ.Press 2007) . Other scholars have postulated that Tobit was excluded from the Jewish Scriptures for a halakhic reason because Raguel, the bride's father, wrote the marriage document discussed in , instead of the bridegroom, as required by Jewish rabbinical law. However, some ancient Jewish rabbinic scholars possibly considered Tobit to be canonical. Midrash Bereishit Rabbah, an aggadic commentary on the Book of Genesis compiled circa A.D. 400‚Äì600, includes a truncated Aramaic version of Tobit. Tobit was also part of the Septuagint, the first Greek translation of the Bible). In more contemporary times, a number of Jews in Israel have sought to reclaim Tobit as part of the canon.Mark Bredin, Studies in the Book of Tobit: A Multidisciplinary Approach, p. 3 (T&T; Clark 2006), .

(14th century AD) Departure of Tobias, guided by the archangel Raphael; cutting from an initial I from a gradual; by the Master of Noah's Ark; Cleveland Museum of Art This book tells the story of Tobit, a righteous Israelite of the tribe of Naphtali, living in Nineveh after Sargon II had deported the northern tribes of Israel to Assyria in 721 B.C. In the two Greek versions, the first two and a half chapters are written in the first person; in the Vulgate version, they are written in the third person.Septuaginta: Editio altera/Revised Edition, 2006: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 1002-1039; Biblia Sacra Vulgata, vierte, verbesserte Auflage 1994: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 676-690. Tobit, raised by his paternal grandmother, Deborah, remains loyal to the worship of God at the temple in Jerusalem, refusing the cult of the golden calves that Jeroboam, king of the northern kingdom of Israel, set up at Dan. He is particularly noted for his diligence in attempting to provide proper burials for fallen Israelites whom Sargon's successor, Sennacherib, has slain. For this behavior the king seizes his property and exiles him. After Sennacherib's death, Tobit is allowed to return to Nineveh, where he buries a man who has been murdered on the street. That night, he sleeps in the open and is blinded by bird droppings which fall into his eyes. His blindness subsequently leads him to falsely accuse his wife, Anna, of stealing a baby goat she had received as partial payment for work she had done.\\"Tobit, book of\\", Cyclop√¶dia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 10 This strains his marriage and, ultimately, he prays for death.\\"Tobit, book of\\", Jewish Encyclopedia Meanwhile, in faraway Media, a young woman named Sarah has prayed for death in despair. The demon of lust, Asmodeus (\\"the worst of demons\\"), abducts and kills every man Sarah marries on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated. God sends the angel Raphael, disguised as a human, to heal Tobit and free Sarah from the demon. The main narrative is dedicated to Tobit's son, Tobiah or Tobiyah (Greek: Tobias), who is sent by his father to collect money that the elder has deposited in distant Media. Raphael presents himself as Tobit's kinsman, Azariah, and offers to aid and protect Tobias. Under Raphael's guidance, Tobias journeys to Media with his dog. Along the way, while washing his feet in the river Tigris, a fish tries to swallow his foot. By the angel's order, he captures it and removes its heart, liver and gall bladder. Tobias and Sara Sleep, 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld Upon arriving in Media, Raphael tells Tobias of the beautiful Sarah, whom Tobias has the right to marry because he is her cousin and closest relative. The angel instructs the young man to burn the fish's liver and heart to drive away the demon when he attacks on the wedding night. The two marry, and the fumes of the burning organs drive the demon to Upper Egypt, where Raphael follows and binds him. Sarah's father had been digging a grave to secretly bury Tobias under the assumption that he would be killed. Surprised to find his son-in-law alive and well, he orders a double-length wedding feast and has the grave secretly filled. Since the feast prevents him from leaving, Tobias sends Raphael to recover his father's money. After the feast, Tobias and Sarah return to Nineveh. There, Raphael tells the youth to use the fish's gall to cure his father's blindness. Raphael then reveals his identity and returns to heaven, and Tobit sings a hymn of praise. Tobit tells his son to leave Nineveh before God destroys it according to prophecy (compare the Book of Nahum). After the prayer, Tobit dies at an advanced age. Tobit's age at death is variously given as 127 years in Greek I, 117 years in Greek II and the Vetus Latina, and 102 years in most manuscripts of the Vulgate, 112 years in others, * (158) \\"an hundred and eight and fifty years old\\" in Tobit 14:11 KJV (Wikisource) * (102) \\"a hundred and two years\\" Douay-Rheims (Biblegateway) After burying his father and mother, Tobias returns to Media with his family. Liturgical and religious significance Readings from the book are used in the Latin Rite. Because of the book's praise for the purity of marriage, it is often read during weddings in many rites. Doctrinally, the book is cited for its teaching on the intercession of angels, filial piety, and reverence for the dead.\\"Introduction\\", Tobit, NAB, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Tobit is also made reference to in chapter 5 of 1 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.http://torahofyeshuah.blogspot.com/2015/07/book-of-meqabyan-i-iii.html Composition =Dating= Tobias heals the blindness of his father Tobit, by Domingos Sequeira The story in the Book of Tobit is set in the 8th century BC, but a number of historical errors rule this out,Miller, at p. 10-11. and most scholars now date the book to between 225 and 175 BC.Fitzmyer, at p. 51. The direct quote in Tobit 2:6 from the Book of Amos (\\"Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation\\") indicates that the prophetic books had become not only fixed but authoritative, signalling a post-exilic date, and reference to the \\"Book of Moses\\" (6:13, 7:11‚Äì13) and the \\"Law of Moses\\" (7:13) echo identical phrasing in the Book of Chronicles, which was composed after the 4th century BC.Fitzmyer, at p. 51; Miller, at p. 11. Dating Tobit's authorship to after 175 BC is problematic, as the author expresses no awareness of Seleucid attempts to Hellenize Judea (from 175 BC) or of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucids (165 BC), nor does it espouse apocalyptic or messianic expectations upon which later writings focused,Fitzmyer, at pp. 51‚Äì52; Miller at pp. 11‚Äì12. but some scholars espouse a later date of composition of at least portions of Tobit.Fitzmyer, at p. 52. =Location and language= No scholarly consensus exists on the place of composition, and \\"almost every region of the ancient world seems to be a candidate.\\"Miller, at pp. 12‚Äì13. A Mesopotamian origin seems logical given that the story takes place in Assyria and Persia, as does the invocation of the Persian demon \\"aeshma daeva\\", rendered \\"Asmodeus\\" by Tobit. But significant errors in geographical detail (such as the distance from Ecbatana to Rhages and their topography) render this origin questionable.Miller, at p. 13. Arguments against and in favor of Judean or Egyptian composition also exist.Miller, at pp. 12‚Äì15. The original language of composition remains unclear. Tobit may have been originally composed either in Aramaic or Hebrew, since fragments of Tobit in both languages have been discovered at Qumran. =Genre= The book is closely related to Jewish wisdom literature. This is especially clear in Tobit's instructions to Tobias before his departure for Media in Chapter 4, which particularly praise the value of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. Manuscripts Leaf from a vellum manuscript, c. 1240. As stated, fragments of Tobit in both Aramaic and Hebrew have been discovered at Qumran.Four Aramaic fragmentary texts of Tobit (4QToba‚Äìdar [=4Q196-199]) and one Hebrew text (4QTobe [=4Q200]) were found at Qumran in Cave IV.A.A. Di Lella, New English Translation of the Septuagint, \\"Tobit\\" (PDF), 2007 Jerome described his version for the Vulgate as being made from an Aramaic text available to him. Surviving Greek translations are found in two versions. The shorter, which Robert Hanhart called Greek I in his edition of the Septuagint, is found in Codex Vaticanus, Alexandrinus, Venetus, and most cursive manuscripts. The Greek II version, 1700 words longer, is found in Codex Sinaiticus and closely aligns with the Hebrew and Aramaic fragments found at Qumran. Apparently the Old Latin (La) manuscripts are also translated from the longer Greek II version. Most English translations since 1966 have relied on the Greek II version.

The group toured with bands including Satyricon, Behemoth, Hecate Enthroned and Rebaelliun, becoming more popular in the black metal underground. In November 2000, the third demo was recorded and released. Lestat then left the band, and Naroth joined permanently. Phalanx Inferna, Asmodeus' first full-length album, was released via Twilight records. Due to the response to the album, Asmodeus were invited to perform at a variety of national and international concerts in 2004. In April 2005, the first tour through Europe took place with Belphegor, Arkhon Infaustus, and In Aeternum. Naroth couldn't play the tour, and was replaced by Azazel. Following the completion of the tour, Ashrak left the band as well. A long search for new permanent members began, and in October 2005, a new drummer, Malthus, was recruited. Asmodeus recorded Imperium Damnatum with T.T. (Abigor) in December 2005 at Infinite Sounds Studios. The new album Adamant was released in a special version as woodpak (CD case made of wood) at the Austrian label Talheim Records. A digipak, vinyl version and a few shows are planned.

He is known for discovering ‚Äì with Yves Coppens and Maurice Taieb ‚Äì the fossil of a female hominin australopithecine known as \\"Lucy\\" in the Afar Triangle region of Hadar, Ethiopia.  Biography  = Early life and education = Johanson was born in Chicago, Illinois to Swedish parents, the nephew of wrestler Ivar Johansson. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1966, and his master's degree (1970) and PhD (1974) from the University of Chicago. At the time of the discovery of Lucy, he was an associate professor of anthropology at Case Western Reserve University. In 1981, he established the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley, California which he later moved to Arizona State University in 1997. Johanson holds an honorary doctorate from Case Western Reserve University, and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Westfield State College in 2008. He is an atheist. = \\"Lucy\\" = Lucy was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia on November 24, 1974, when Johanson, coaxed away from his paperwork by graduate student Tom Gray for a spur-of-the-moment survey, caught the glint of a white fossilized bone out of the corner of his eye, and recognized it as hominin. Forty percent of the skeleton was eventually recovered, and was later described as the first known member of Australopithecus afarensis. Johanson was astonished to find so much of her skeleton all at once. Pamela Alderman, a member of the expedition, suggested she be named \\"Lucy\\" after the Beatles' song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" which was played repeatedly during the night of the discovery. A bipedal hominin, Lucy stood about three and a half feet tall; her bipedalism supported Raymond Dart's theory that australopithecines walked upright. Johanson and his team concluded from Lucy's rib that she ate a plant-based diet, and from her curved finger bones that she was probably still at home in trees. They did not immediately see Lucy as a separate species, but considered her an older member of Australopithecus africanus. The discovery, however, of several more skulls of similar morphology persuaded most palaeontologists to classify her as a species called afarensis. Johanson and Maitland A. Edey won a 1982 U.S. National Book Award in ScienceThis was the 1982 award for paperback Science. From 1980 to 1983 in National Book Awards history there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and multiple nonfiction subcategories.

The Packer family company owned a controlling interest in both the Nine television network and leading Australian publishing company Australian Consolidated Press, which were later merged to form Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL). Outside Australia, Packer was best known for founding World Series Cricket. At the time of his death, Packer was the richest and one of the most influential men in Australia. In 2004, Business Review Weekly magazine estimated Packer's net worth at . Early life Kerry Packer was born Kerry Francis Bullmore Packer on 17 December 1937 in Sydney. His father was Sir Frank Packer, an Australian media proprietor who controlled Australian Consolidated Press and the Nine Network. His mother, Gretel Bullmore, was the daughter of Herbert Bullmore, the Scottish rugby union player. He had an older brother, Clyde Packer. He took part in various sports at school, including boxing, cricket, and rugby; though he struggled academically, possibly due to undiagnosed dyslexia. On his father's death in 1974, the family estate, valued at $100 million, passed directly to Packer. His father had fallen out with his elder son, Clyde, in 1972. Business Packer, through his family company Consolidated Press Holdings, was the major shareholder with a 37% holding in Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL). Until Packer's death PBL owned the Nine television network, and Australian Consolidated Press which produces many of Australia's top-selling magazines. He was involved in a number of other gambling and tourism ventures, notably Crown Casino in Melbourne. The Nine Network and Australian Consolidated Press businesses have since been divested to PBL Media. Packer was widely respected in business circles, courted by politicians on both sides, and was widely regarded as one of the most astute businessmen of his time, despite having been a poor student. Although Packer's reputation as an astute businessman was legendary and he made some good investments, he was by no means a self-made man‚Äîhis grandfather, Robert Clyde Packer, and his father, Sir Frank Packer, had built up the media empire and its related holdings over many decades. As pointed out by internet news outlet Crikey, if $100 million had been invested in the Australian sharemarket in September 1974 through a balanced portfolio of the top 200 companies, that portfolio would be worth a lot more than $6.9 billion in December 2005, possibly as much as $11 billion.\\"How good a businessman was Packer\\", Crikey, 9 January 2006 http://www.crikey.com.au/articles/2006/01/09-1554-6139.htm Packer controlled Nine Network and Nine's Wide World of Sports in the 1980s, and \\"famously sold the network to Alan Bond and then bought it back three years later for less than a quarter of the price.\\" Writes the Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Packer's decision to sell Nine to Bond in 1987 for $1.2 billion - before buying back the network in 1990 for $250 million - is legendary in Australian television.\\"\\"'No crying in television': Packer would be pragmatic about switch\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Chris Barrett, 13 April 2018 Moreover, Packer was not the first choice to take over the running of the family's business empire‚Äîhis father had intended that Kerry's elder brother, Clyde Packer, would take over the company, but Clyde fell out with his father in the early 1970s and left Australia permanently. Kerry Packer's independent business life began after his father's death in 1974 when he inherited control of the family's controlling share in PBL, valued at . Further, his principal Australian investments in television and casinos were highly protected from competition by government regulation which Packer and his employees worked very hard to have maintained. The Packer family's business reputation suffered a blow following the 2001 collapse of One.Tel, a telephone company in which his son, James, had invested. Kerry Packer was also one of Australia's largest landholders. In 2003, a deposit of rubies was discovered on one of his properties. The Packer media empire included magazines, television networks, telecommunications, petrochemicals, heavy engineering, a 75% stake in the Perisher Blue ski resort, diamond exploration, coal mines and property, a share in the Foxtel cable TV network, and investments in the lucrative casino business in Australia and overseas. Media interests =The \\"Packer Empire\\"= The Packer family has long been involved in media. Packer's grandfather Robert Clyde Packer owned two Sydney newspapers while his father, Sir Frank Packer, was one of Australia's first media moguls, and Kerry's son, James, was executive chairman of PBL, before resigning in 2008. Sir Frank wanted Kerry to experience work in the newspaper industry from the ground up, so Packer started in the loading dock of the Sydney newspaper The Telegraph, loading papers. He was not originally destined for the role, but in the early 1970s Kerry took the place of the designated successor, his older brother, Clyde, after Clyde fell out with their father, quit PBL and moved to America. Kerry took over the running of PBL in 1974, on the death of his father. =Alan Bond media buyback= In 1987, Packer made a fortune at the expense of disgraced tycoon Alan Bond. He reportedly sold Bond the Nine Network at the record price of in 1987, and then bought it back three years later for a mere A$250 million, when Bond's empire was collapsing. Packer later quipped, \\"You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I've had mine\\". Packer was then able to reinvest the proceeds in a 25% share in the Foxtel pay TV consortium. After the sale to Bond, Packer said that he had regretted the decision to sell Nine and wished he had not gone through with the transaction. At the 2006 PBL AGM, Kerry's son, James, told of the true complexities of the deal. Kerry Packer received A$800 million in cash, with A$250 million left in Bond Media as subordinated debt. As Bond went under, Packer converted the subordinated debt into a 37% stake in Bond Media. About A$500 million of debt remained in Bond Media. Packer received $800 million in cash before receiving a free 37% equity stake that put a debt-included value of A$500 million on the Nine Network, which by then included Channel Nine in Brisbane. =Hands-on business approach= Packer sometimes took a direct interest in the editorial content of his papers, although he was far less interventionist than the notoriously hands-on Rupert Murdoch. Packer also occasionally interfered directly in the programming of his TV stations; in 1992, he called his Sydney station, TCN-9, and ordered its personnel to \\"Get that shit off the air!\\", referring to Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos hosted by Doug Mulray, which was cut during its first and only airing on national television. (It has since aired in its entirety). He is also said to have often manipulated broadcasts of cricket himself, to ensure that the end of a cricket match was broadcast, despite previously set television broadcast schedules. =Government inquiry and legal challenges= Packer faced a 1991 Australian government inquiry into the print media industry with some reluctance, but great humour. When asked to state his full name and the capacity in which he appeared, he replied: \\"Kerry Francis Bullmore Packer. I have appeared here reluctantly.\\" Packer fronted the inquiry over allegations that he had some secret control over the content of the Fairfax papers (an organisation that Packer had wished to purchase for some time, but was restricted from by cross-ownership laws). During the inquiry, he repeatedly berated the politicians conducting it, and the government. When asked about his company's tax-minimisation schemes, he replied: \\"Of course I am minimising my tax. And if anybody in this country doesn't minimise their tax, they want their heads read, because as a government, I can tell you you're not spending it that well that we should be donating extra!\\" At the time of his death, the Nine Network was the jewel in the PBL crown. Although it had a tough year in 2005 against rival Seven Network (which was aided largely by US TV hits such as Desperate Housewives and Lost), Nine still finished the year as the number-one network. World Series Cricket Outside Australia, Packer was best known for founding World Series Cricket. In 1977 the Nine Network cricket rights deal led to a confrontation with the cricket authorities, as top players from several countries rushed to join him at the expense of their international sides. One of the leaders of the \\"rebellion\\" was England captain Tony Greig. Greig remained a commentator on the Nine Network's payroll until his death in December 2012. Packer's aim was to secure broadcasting rights for Australian cricket, and he was largely successful. In the 1970s the global cricket establishment fiercely opposed Packer in the courts. To counter the establishment, Packer hired the ten best Senior Counsels in the UK and put them on retainers, stipulating that they were not to take on any additional work during the court case (the sole purpose of which was to deny the establishment the best legal minds to prosecute their case) . When he died he was mourned with a minute's silence at the MCG as one of the most influential figures in the history of the sport. Packer was famously quoted from a 1976 meeting with the Australian Cricket Board, with whom he met to negotiate the rights to televise cricket. According to witnesses, he said: \\"There is a little bit of the whore in all of us, gentlemen. What is your price?\\" World Rugby Corporation Packer funded the World Rugby Corporation (WRC), a company formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby union competition in 1995. A majority of the All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to the WRC. In response, the Australian, New Zealand and South African rugby unions formed SANZAR, who partnered with News Limited to launch two professional competitions, the Super 12 and Tri Nations Series. The South African Rugby Union told the Springboks players that they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC, and they remained with the SARU. Most of the All Blacks then followed them, and finally the Wallabies did too, so the WRC project was abandoned. Controversy Packer was often the centre of controversy. One of the earliest incidents occurred on 7 June 1960, when his father was trying to take over the Anglican Press, a small publisher run by Francis James. According to author Richard Neville, Frank Packer was angered by James' refusal to sell the Anglican Press, so he sent Kerry and some burly friends to pressure him into selling. They forced their way in and reportedly began vandalising the premises, but James was able to barricade himself in his office and call Rupert Murdoch, Packer's most powerful rival. Murdoch quickly dispatched his own team of 'heavies', who threw Kerry and friends out. Not surprisingly, the Murdoch press had a field day with the news that the son of Australia's biggest media tycoon had been caught brawling in the street. Like Murdoch, Packer's critics saw his ever-expanding cross-media holdings as a potential threat to media diversity and freedom of speech. He also repeatedly came under fire for his companies' alleged involvement in tax evasion schemes and for the extremely low amounts of company tax that his corporations are reported to have paid over the years. He fought repeated battles with the Australian Taxation Office over his corporate taxes. His most severe legal challenge came in 1984 with the Costigan Commission alleging (using the codename of \\"the squirrel\\", renamed \\"the Goanna\\" in media reports) that he was involved in tax evasion and organised crime, including drug trafficking. He successfully counter-attacked the commission with the assistance of his counsel Malcolm Turnbull. In 1987 the charges were formally dismissed by Attorney-General Lionel Bowen. Mystery surrounded Packer's receipt of a \\"loan\\" of A$225,000 in cash from Brian Ray, a bankrupt Queensland businessman. When questioned about this transaction at the Costigan Royal Commission Packer said \\"...I like cash. I have a squirrel mentality. I like to keep money in cash. It is by no means the most cash I ever had in my life.\\" Notwithstanding the significant efforts made to preserve his security and privacy, Packer suffered two mysterious break-ins at his companies' headquarters in Park Street, Sydney: * in 1995, 25 gold bars, weighing a total of , and a Vegemite jar full of gold nuggets were stolen from Packer's personal safe; * in 2003, a licensed Glock semi-automatic pistol was stolen from a desk drawer on the executive level. Packer was not charged with failing to \\"keep safe\\" the weapon but he did subsequently surrender his firearms licence. Packer broke the sports boycott of apartheid South Africa which prevented South African sportsmen from representing their country when he recruited a number of South African cricketers to play on his World Series Cricket Team. His timing was criticised, coming just months after the Soweto riots and the death of Steve Biko, murdered by the members of the South African security forces. Personal life Packer's primary schooling suffered greatly when he was stricken with a severe bout of poliomyelitis at age eight, and he was confined to an iron lung for nine months. His father apparently thought little of his son's abilities, once cruelly describing him as \\"the family idiot\\", although Kerry subsequently steered PBL to heights far beyond anything his father or brother achieved. The nickname his father gave Kerry made him strive to new heights in schooling, trying to achieve \\"A\\" grades. His end of year report said he was one of the most notable students. In an interview, former employee Trevor Sykes stated that \\"He didn't read much on the printed page. If you didn't want Kerry to read something, you wrote more than a one-page memo.\\" Packer's grandfather Herbert Bullmore represented the Scotland national rugby union team in an international match against Ireland in Dublin in 1902 and worked as a doctor in Sydney for many years. Kerry Packer and his wife of 42 years, Roslyn Packer (nee Weedon), had two children: a daughter, Gretel, and a son, James. At the time of Packer's death, he and Ros had two grandchildren: Francesca then 10, and Ben, then 7, from Gretel's first marriage to British financier Nick Barham, and Gretel and her husband Shane Murray were expecting their first child together, William (born 2006). Gretel and Shane married just before Packer's death. Packer conducted extra- marital affairs with a number of women including the model Carol Lopes‚Äîwho reportedly committed suicide after being shunned by Packer‚Äîpublisher and former ConPress employee Ita Buttrose, and Julie Trethowan, his long-time mistress and manager (from 1983) of the Packer-owned Sydney city health and fitness club, the Hyde Park Club. After his death, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that from about 1995, Packer transferred control of multimillion- dollar Sydney real estate holdings to Trethowan. In June 2009, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that former federal opposition leader, and subsequently an Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull ‚Äì a former legal adviser and business associate of Packer ‚Äì revealed to journalist Annabel Crabb that Packer had threatened to have him killed when they fell out over their 1991 attempt to take over the Fairfax newspaper group through their Tourang consortium. Packer reportedly made the threat after Turnbull told Packer he was going to have him thrown out of the consortium by revealing Packer's intention to play an interventionist role in the newspaper group. Packer was a supporter of South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League competition. He was an advocate of the Australian Republic Movement. =Polo= Packer was a keen polo player. In 1992, he and Gonzalo Pieres Sr. founded Ellerstina, a polo team that has claimed multiple titles at the Argentine Open and other high-handicap tournaments. Packer bought the Fyning Hill estate in West Sussex and expanded it to over 400 acres. Packer built the headquarters for his Ellerston polo team at Fyning Hill, and would arrive at the estate in May for the three-month English polo season. Packer sold the estate to the Russian businessman Roman Abramovich in 1999 for 12 million. =Gambling= Packer was a longtime heavy smoker and an avid gambler, fabled for his large wins and losses. In 1999, a three-week losing streak at London casinos cost him almost A$28 million ‚Äì the biggest reported gambling loss in British history. Once he won A$33 million at the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas and that he often won as much as A$7 million each year during his annual holidays in the UK. Packer's visits were a risky affair for the casinos, as his wins and losses could make quite a difference to the finances of even bigger casinos. Packer was also known for his sometimes volcanic temper, and for his perennial contempt for journalists who sought to question his activities. Packer is quoted for an exchange in a poker tournament at the Stratosphere Casino, where a Texan oil investor was attempting to engage him in a game of poker. Upon the Texan saying \\"I'm worth $60,000,000!\\" Packer apparently pulled out a coin and asked nonchalantly, \\"heads or tails?\\", referring to an A$120 million wager (according to Bob Stupak's biography). Some variations of the story put the sum at A$60 million to A$100 million and claim the line was \\"I'll toss you for it\\". In the late 1990s he walked into a major London casino and played ¬£15 million on four roulette tables on his own and lost it all. This has been confirmed by casino owners in South East England. Failing health Packer suffered as many as four heart attacks. In 1990, while playing polo at Warwick Farm, Sydney, he suffered from a heart attack that left him clinically dead for seven minutes. Packer was revived by paramedics and then airlifted to St Vincent's Private Hospital Sydney, and received bypass surgery from Dr Victor Chang, a pioneering cardiac surgeon. It was not common for an ambulance to have a defibrillator at the time ‚Äì it was purely by chance that the ambulance which responded to the call had one fitted. After recovering, Packer donated a large sum to the Ambulance Service of New South Wales to pay for equipping all NSW ambulances with a portable defibrillator (colloquially known as \\"Packer Whackers\\"). He told Nick Greiner \\"I'll go you 50/50\\", and the NSW State government paid the other half of the cost. He is reported to have said, \\"Son, I've been to the other side, and let me tell you, there's nothing there.\\"Obituary: Kerry Packer The Guardian. Retrieved on 2018-04-27. And in a press conference, \\"...there's no one waiting there for you, there's no one to judge you, so you can do what you bloody well like\\".Hold on, Kerry. It seems there is something there . Theage.com.au. Retrieved on 2013-08-20. He also suffered from a chronic kidney condition for many years, and in 2000, he made headlines when his long-serving helicopter pilot, Nick Ross, donated one of his own kidneys to Packer for transplantation. The story of the transplant was covered in detail by the Australian TV documentary program Australian Story, a rare occasion on which Packer granted a media interview (and, to the surprise of many, not to his own network; Australian Story is produced by the public network, ABC). After recovering from the operation, Packer launched an organ transplant association in memory of cricketer David Hookes. Death Kerry Packer died of kidney failure on 26 December 2005, nine days after his 68th birthday, at home in Sydney, Australia, with his family by his bedside. Knowing that his health was failing, he instructed his doctors not to treat him with curative intent or by artificially prolonging his life with dialysis. He told his cardiologist earlier in the week that he was \\"running out of petrol\\" and wanted to \\"die with dignity\\". His private funeral service was held on 30 December 2005, at the family's country retreat, Ellerston, near Scone in the Hunter Region. Having obtained council permission, he was buried on the Ellerston property near the polo field. In 2007, the Chaser's Andrew Hansen made passing mention of Packer's death in The Eulogy Song. = State memorial service = The Packer family accepted an offer of a state memorial service, which was held on 17 February 2006 at the Sydney Opera House. The granting of this taxpayer- funded honour was criticised by some members of the community as Packer was famous for his alleged tax minimisation. At the memorial service, close friend Alan Jones was Master of Ceremonies; the service featured speeches from son, James, Russell Crowe on behalf of daughter Gretel, Prime Minister John Howard and Richie Benaud. Attendees included Tom Cruise (a friend of James Packer) and his then partner Katie Holmes; Greg Norman; members of the Australian cricket team; and past and present figures from all sides of politics. Philanthropy The Kerry Packer Civic Gallery within the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre of the University of South Australia was endowed by the Packer family.

He was of the Antediluvian period in the Hebrew Bible. This Enoch is not to be confused with Cain's son Enoch (). The text of the Book of Genesis says Enoch lived 365 years before he was taken by God. The text reads that Enoch \\"walked with God: and he was no more; for God took him\\" (), which is interpreted as Enoch's entering Heaven alive in some Jewish and Christian traditions. Enoch is the subject of many Jewish and Christian traditions. He was considered the author of the Book of EnochAugust Dillmann and R. Charles (1893). The Book of Enoch, translation from Geez. and also called Enoch the scribe of judgment.1Enoch, chap. 12 The New Testament has three references to Enoch from the lineage of Seth (Luke 3:37, Hebrews 11:5, Jude 1:14‚Äì15). Enoch in the Book of Genesis Enoch, litography by William Blake, 1807. Enoch appears in the Book of Genesis of the Pentateuch as the seventh of the ten pre-Deluge Patriarchs. Genesis recounts that each of the pre-Flood Patriarchs lived for several centuries. Genesis 5 provides a genealogy of these ten figures (from Adam to Noah), providing the age at which each fathered the next, and the age of each figure at death. Enoch is considered by many to be the exception, who is said to \\"not see death\\" (). Furthermore, states that Enoch lived 365 years, which is shorter than his peers, who are all recorded as dying at over 700 years of age. The brief account of Enoch in Genesis 5 ends with the cryptic note that \\"he was not; for God took him\\".Genesis 5:24, KJV Apocryphal Books of Enoch Three extensive Apocrypha are attributed to Enoch: *Book of Enoch, composed in a Semitic language and preserved in Ge'ez, first brought to Europe by James Bruce and translated in English by August Dillmann and Reverent Schoode ‚Äì recognized by the Orthodox Tewahedo churches and usually dated between the third century BC and the first century AD. *Second Book of Enoch or the Book of the Secrets of Enoch, written in Old Church Slavonic, first translated in English by William Morfill ‚Äì usually dated to the first century AD. *3 Enoch, a Rabbinic text in Hebrew usually dated to the fifth century AD. These recount how Enoch was taken up to Heaven and was appointed guardian of all the celestial treasures, chief of the archangels, and the immediate attendant on the Throne of God. He was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries and, with all the angels at his back, fulfils of his own accord whatever comes out of the mouth of God, executing His decrees. Much esoteric literature like the 3 Enoch identifies Enoch as the Metatron, the angel which communicates God's word. In consequence, Enoch was seen, by this literature, and the Rabbinic kabbalah of Jewish mysticism, as having been the one which communicated God's revelation to Moses, in particular, the dictator of the Book of Jubilees. =Enoch in Book of Giants= The Book of Giants is a Jewish pseudepigraphal work from the third century BC and resembles the Book of Enoch. Fragments from at least six and as many as eleven copies were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls collections. =Septuagint= The third-century BC translators who produced the Septuagint in Koine Greek rendered the phrase \\"God took him\\" with the Greek verb metatithemi ()5:24 Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œµ·ΩêŒ∑œÅŒ≠œÉœÑŒ∑œÉŒµŒΩ ŒïŒΩœâœá œÑ·ø∑ Œ∏Œµ·ø∑ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œø·Ωêœá Œ∑·ΩëœÅŒØœÉŒ∫ŒµœÑŒø ·ΩÖœÑŒπ ŒºŒµœÑŒ≠Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ΩÅ Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ meaning moving from one place to another.LSJ metatithemi Sirach 44:16, from about the same period, states that \\"Enoch pleased God and was translated into paradise that he may give repentance to the nations.\\" The Greek word used here for paradise, paradeisos (), was derived from an ancient Persian word meaning \\"enclosed garden\\", and was used in the Septuagint to describe the garden of Eden. Later, however, the term became synonymous for heaven, as is the case here.G3857 œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒµŒπœÉŒøœÇ Strong's Greek Lexicon.

One view regarding Enoch that was found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, which thought of Enoch as a pious man, taken to Heaven, and receiving the title of Safra rabba (Great scribe). After Christendom was completely separated from Judaism, this view became the prevailing rabbinical idea of Enoch's character and exaltation. According to RashiRashi's Commentary on . See also Commentary of Ibn Ezra. [from Genesis Rabbah25:1], \\"Enoch was a righteous man, but he could easily be swayed to return to do evil. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, hastened and took him away and caused him to die before his time. For this reason, Scripture changed [the wording] in [the account of] his demise and wrote, 'and he was no longer' in the world to complete his years.\\" Among the minor Midrashim, esoteric attributes of Enoch are expanded upon. In the Sefer Hekalot, Rabbi Ishmael is described as having visited the Seventh Heaven, where he met Enoch, who claims that earth had, in his time, been corrupted by the demons Shammazai, and Azazel, and so Enoch was taken to Heaven to prove that God was not cruel. Similar traditions are recorded in Sirach. Later elaborations of this interpretation treated Enoch as having been a pious ascetic, who, called to mix with others, preached repentance, and gathered (despite the small number of people on Earth) a vast collection of disciples, to the extent that he was proclaimed king. Under his wisdom, peace is said to have reigned on earth, to the extent that he is summoned to Heaven to rule over the sons of God. Enoch in Christianity Patriarch Enoch, a fresco by Theophanes the Greek, 14th century. =New Testament= The New Testament contains three references to Enoch. *The first is a brief mention in one of the genealogies of the ancestors of Jesus by Luke (Luke 3:37). *The second mention is in Hebrews 11: 5 (KJV) which says, \\"By faith, Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation, he had this testimony, that he pleased God.\\" This suggests he did not experience the mortal death ascribed to Adam's other descendants which is consistent with Genesis 5:24(KJV), which says, \\"And Enoch walked with God: and he [was] not; for God took him.\\" *The third mention is in the Epistle of Jude (1:14‚Äì15) where the author attributes to \\"Enoch, the Seventh from Adam\\" a passage not found in Catholic and Protestant canons of the Old Testament. The quotation is believed by most modern scholars to be taken from 1 Enoch 1:9 which exists in Greek, in Ge'ez (as part of the Ethiopian Orthodox canon), and also in Aramaic among the Dead Sea Scrolls.4Q Enoch (4Q204[4QENAR]) COL I 16‚Äì18Clontz, T.E. and J., \\"The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh\\", Cornerstone Publications, 2008, p. 711, Though the same scholars recognise that 1 Enoch 1:9 itself is a midrash of the words of Moses \\"he came from the ten thousands of holy ones\\" from Deuteronomy 33:2.\\"The initial oracle in chapters 1‚Äì5 is a paraphrase of part of Deuteronomy 33,24\\" George W.

Church Fathers such as Justin Martyr, Athenagoras of Athens, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, and Lactantius all speak highly of Enoch and contain many allusions to the Book of Enoch as well as in some instances advocating explicitly for the use of the Book of Enoch as Scripture. Because of the letter of Jude's citation of the Book of Enoch as prophetic text, this encouraged acceptance and usage of the Book of Enoch in early Christian circles. The main themes of Enoch about the Watchers corrupting humanity were commonly mentioned in early literature. This positive treatment of the Book of Enoch was associated with millennialism which was popular in the early Church. When amillennialism began to be common in Christianity, the Book of Enoch, being incompatible with amillennialism, started to be rejected widespread, and with the split of the Oriental Orthodox from the Catholic Church in the 5th century, use of the Book of Enoch was limited primarily to the Oriental Orthodox Church. Eventually, the usage of the Book of Enoch became limited to Ethiopian circles of the Oriental Orthodox Church. Another common element that some Church Fathers, like John of Damascus, spoke of, was that they considered Enoch to be one of the two witnesses mentioned in the Book of Revelation. This view still has many supporters today in Christianity. Elijah and Enoch ‚Äì seventeenth-century icon, Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland =In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints theology= Among the Latter Day Saint movement and particularly in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Enoch is viewed as having founded an exceptionally righteous city, named Zion, in the midst of an otherwise wicked world. This view is encountered in the standard works, the Pearl of Great Price and the Doctrine and Covenants, which states that not only Enoch, but the entire peoples of the city of Zion, were taken off this earth without death, because of their piety. (Zion is defined as \\"the pure in heart\\" and this city of Zion will return to the earth at the Second Coming of Jesus.) The Doctrine and Covenants further states that Enoch prophesied that one of his descendants, Noah, and his family, would survive a Great Flood and thus carry on the human race and preserve the Scripture. The Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price includes chapters that give an account of Enoch's preaching, visions, and conversations with God. They provide details concerning the wars, violence and natural disasters in Enoch's day, but also reference the miracles performed by Enoch. The Book of Moses is itself an excerpt from Joseph Smith's translation of the Bible, which is published in full, complete with these chapters concerning Enoch, by Community of Christ, in the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, where it appears as part of the Book of Genesis. D&C; 104:24 (CofC) / (LDS) states that Adam ordained Enoch to the higher priesthood (now called the Melchizedek, after the great king and high priest) at age 25, that he was 65 when Adam blessed him, and that he lived for an additional 365 years until he and his city were translated, making Enoch 430 years old at the time that \\"he was not, for God took him\\" (Genesis 5:24). Additionally in LDS theology, Enoch is implied to be the scribe who recorded Adam's blessings and prophecies at Adam-ondi-Ahman, as recorded in D&C; (LDS) / D&C; 104:29b (CofC). Enoch in Islam In Islam, Enoch () is commonly identified with Idris, as for example by the History of Al-Tabari interpretation and the Meadows of Gold.Alexander Philip S. Biblical Figures Outside the Bible p.118 ed. Michael E. Stone, Theodore A. Bergren 2002 p118 \\"twice in the Qur'an.. was commonly identified by Muslim scholars with the biblical Enoch, and that this identification opened the way for importing into Islam a substantial body of postbiblical Jewish legend about the character and ....\\" The Quran contains two references to Idris; in Surah Al-Anbiya (The Prophets) verse number 85, and in Surah Maryam (Mary) verses 56‚Äì57: *(The Prophets, 21:85): \\"And the same blessing was bestowed upon Ismail and Idris and Zul-Kifl, because they all practised fortitude.\\" *(Mary 19:56‚Äì57): \\"And remember Idris in the Book; he was indeed very truthful, a Prophet. And We lifted him to a lofty station\\". Idris is closely linked in Muslim tradition with the origin of writing and other technical arts of civilization,History of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, B. M. Wheeler, Enoch including the study of astronomical phenomena, both of which Enoch is credited with in the Testament of Abraham. Nonetheless, although some Muslims view Enoch and Idris as the same prophet while others do not, many Muslims still honor Enoch as one of the earliest prophets, regardless of which view they hold.Lives of the Prophets, L.

After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village such as Sin-√©, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labelsBrowne (2001), pp. 171‚Äì3 and Herb Cohen, the manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley,Browne (2001), p. 107 he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994. Over the following three years, the band toured extensively to promote the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer. In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four- track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, fully clothed, in the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4. Since his death, there have been many posthumous releases of his material, including a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk, expansions of Grace, and the Live at Sin-√© EP. Chart success also came posthumously: with his cover of Leonard Cohen's song \\"Hallelujah\\" he attained his first number one on Billboards Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached number two in the UK Singles Chart that December. Rolling Stone included Grace in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and included Buckley in their list of the greatest singers. Early life Born in Anaheim, California, Buckley was the only son of Mary Guibert and Tim Buckley. His mother was a Zonian of mixed Greek, French, and Panamanian descent, while his father was the son of an Irish American father and an Italian American mother.Browne (2001), p. 16 Buckley was raised by his mother and stepfather, Ron Moorhead, in Southern California, and had a half- brother, Corey Moorhead.Browne (2001), pp. 62‚Äì63 Buckley moved many times in and around Orange County while growing up, an upbringing Buckley called \\"rootless trailer trash\\". As a child, Buckley was known as Scott \\"Scottie\\" Moorhead based on his middle name and his stepfather's surname. His biological father, Tim Buckley, was a singer-songwriter who released a series of folk and jazz albums in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and whom, he said, he only met once, at the age of eight. After his biological father died of a drug overdose in 1975,Browne (2001), p. 11 he chose to go by Buckley and his real first name, which he found on his birth certificate.Browne (2001), p. 68 To members of his family he remained \\"Scottie\\". Buckley was brought up around music. His mother was a classically trained pianist and cellist. His stepfather introduced him to Led Zeppelin, Queen, Jimi Hendrix, the Who, and Pink Floyd at an early age. Buckley grew up singing around the house and in harmony with his mother, later noting that all his family sang. He began playing guitar at the age of five after discovering an acoustic guitar in his grandmother's closet. Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti was the first album he ever owned; the hard rock band Kiss was also an early favourite.Browne (2001), p. 64 At the age of 12, he decided to become a musician, and received his first electric guitar a black Les Paul at the age of 13.Browne (2001), p. 67 He attended Loara High School, and played in the school's jazz band.Browne (2001), p. 69 During this time, he developed an affinity for progressive rock bands such as Rush, Genesis, and Yes, as well as jazz fusion guitarist Al Di Meola.Browne (2001), p. 70 After graduating from high school, he moved north to Hollywood to attend the Musicians Institute,Browne (2001), p. 95 completing the one-year course at the age of 19.Browne (2001), p. 97 Buckley later told Rolling Stone the school was \\"the biggest waste of time\\", but noted in an interview with DoubleTake Magazine that he appreciated studying music theory there, saying, \\"I was attracted to really interesting harmonies, stuff that I would hear in Ravel, Ellington, Bart√≥k.\\" Career Buckley spent the next six years working in a hotel and playing guitar in various struggling bands playing in styles from jazz, reggae, and roots rock to heavy metal.Browne (2001), pp. 99‚Äì103 He toured with the dancehall reggae artist Shinehead and also played the occasional funk and R&B; studio session, collaborating with fledgling producer Michael J. Clouse to form X-Factor Productions.Browne (2001), pp. 98‚Äì99 Throughout this period, Buckley limited his singing to backing vocals. He moved to New York City in February 1990,Browne (2001), p. 104 but found few opportunities to work as a musician. He was introduced to Qawwali, the Sufi devotional music of India and Pakistan, and to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, one of its best-known singers.Browne (2001), pp. 106‚Äì07 Buckley was an impassioned fan of Khan, and during what he called his \\"cafe days\\", he often covered Khan's songs. In January 1996, he interviewed Khan for Interview and wrote liner notes for Khan's Supreme Collection, Vol. 1 compilation. He became interested in blues musician Robert Johnson and hardcore punk band Bad Brains during this time. Buckley moved back to Los Angeles in September when his father's former manager, Herb Cohen, offered to help him record his first demo of original songs. Buckley completed Babylon Dungeon Sessions, a four- song cassette that included the songs \\"Eternal Life\\", \\"Unforgiven\\" (later titled \\"Last Goodbye\\"), \\"Strawberry Street\\" (a different version of which appears on the Grace Legacy Edition), and punk screamer \\"Radio\\".Browne (2001), p. 205 Cohen and Buckley hoped to attract attention from the music industry with the demo tape.Browne (2001), pp. 108‚Äì09 Buckley flew back to New York early the following year to make his public singing debut at a tribute concert for his father called \\"Greetings from Tim Buckley\\".Browne (2001), pp. 130‚Äì134 The event, produced by show business veteran Hal Willner, was held at St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn on April 26, 1991. Buckley rejected the idea of the concert as a springboard to his career, instead citing personal reasons regarding his decision to sing at the tribute. With accompaniment by experimental rock guitarist Gary Lucas, Buckley performed \\"I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain\\", a song Tim Buckley wrote about an infant Jeff Buckley and his mother.Browne (2001), pp. 136‚Äì37 Buckley returned to the stage to play \\"Sefronia ‚Äì The King's Chain\\", \\"Phantasmagoria in Two\\", and concluded the concert with \\"Once I Was\\" performed acoustically with an impromptu a cappella ending, due to a snapped guitar string. Willner, the show's organizer, later recalled that Buckley's set closer made a strong impression. Buckley's performance at the concert was counter-intuitive to his desire to distance himself musically from his father. Buckley later explained his reasoning to Rolling Stone: \\"It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But it bothered me that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd never been able to tell him anything. I used that show to pay my last respects.\\" The concert proved to be his first step into the music industry that had eluded him for years.Browne (2001), p. 138 On subsequent trips to New York in mid-1991, Buckley began co-writing with Gary Lucas resulting in the songs \\"Grace\\" and \\"Mojo Pin\\",Browne (2001), pp. 140‚Äì141 and by late 1991 he began performing with Lucas' band Gods and Monsters around New York City. After being offered a development deal as a member of Gods and Monsters at Imago Records, Buckley moved back to New York to the Lower East Side at the end of 1991.Browne (2001), p. 142 The day after Gods and Monsters officially debuted in March 1992, he decided to leave the band.Browne (2001), p. 146 Buckley began performing at several clubs and caf√©s around Lower Manhattan, but Sin-√© in the East Village became his main venue. He first appeared at Sin-√© in April 1992,Browne (2001), p. 165 and quickly earned a regular Monday night slot there.Browne (2001), p. 167 His repertoire consisted of a diverse range of folk, rock, R&B;, blues and jazz cover songs, much of it music he had newly learned. During this period, he discovered singers such as Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Van Morrison, and Judy Garland.Browne (2001), p. 166 Buckley performed an eclectic selection of covers from a range of artists from Led Zeppelin, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Bob Dylan, √âdith Piaf, Elton John, the Smiths, Bad Brains, Leonard Cohen, Robert Johnson and Siouxsie Sioux.Untiedundone.com archives His version of \\"Killing Time\\" performed at the radio WFMU Studios, East Orange, New Jersey, 10.11.92 \\"Killing Time\\" is a Siouxsie/The Creatures song from the Creatures's Boomerang albumJeffBuckley-fr.net list of songs covered by Jeff Buckley including \\"Killing Time\\" composed by Siouxsie for The Creatures. Original songs from the Babylon Dungeon Sessions, and the songs he'd written with Gary Lucas were also included in his set lists. He performed solo, accompanying himself on a borrowed Fender Telecaster. Buckley stated that he learned how to perform onstage from playing to small audiences. Over the next few months, Buckley attracted admiring crowds and attention from record label executives.Browne (2001), pp. 170‚Äì71 Industry maven Clive Davis even dropped by to see him. By the summer of 1992, limos from executives eager to sign the singer lined the street outside Sin-√©. Buckley signed with Columbia Records, home of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen,Browne (2001), p. 174 for a three-album, essentially million-dollar deal in October 1992.Browne (2001), pp. 173, 177‚Äì179 Buckley spent three days in February 1993 in the studio with engineer Steve Addabbo and Columbia A&R; man, Steve Berkowitz, recording much of Buckley's solo repertoire. Buckley sang a cappella and also accompanied himself on acoustic and electric guitars, Wurlitzer electric piano, and harmonium. These tapes remain unreleased in the Columbia vaults, but much of this material later surfaced on the Grace album.Browne (2001) Recording dates were set for July and August 1993 for what would become Buckley's recording debut, an EP of four songs which included a cover of Van Morrison's \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\".Browne (2001), pp. 199‚Äì200 Live at Sin-√© was released on November 23, 1993, documenting this period of Buckley's life.Browne (2001), p. 223 Grace In mid-1993, Buckley began working on his first album with record producer Andy Wallace. Buckley assembled a band, composed of bassist Mick Gr√∏ndahl and drummer Matt Johnson, and spent several weeks rehearsing.Browne (2001), pp. 201‚Äì03 In September, the trio headed to Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York to spend six weeks recording basic tracks for what would become Grace. Buckley invited ex-bandmate Lucas to play guitar on the songs \\"Grace\\" and \\"Mojo Pin\\", and Woodstock-based jazz musician Karl Berger wrote and conducted string arrangements with Buckley assisting at times.Browne (2001), pp. 204‚Äì208 Buckley returned home for overdubbing at studios in Manhattan and New Jersey, where he performed take after take to capture the perfect vocals and experimented with ideas for additional instruments, and added textures to the songs.Browne (2001), pp. 224-26 In January 1994, Buckley left to go on his first solo North American tour to support Live at Sin-√©. It was followed by a 10-day European tour in March.Browne (2001), p. 230 Buckley played clubs and coffeehouses and made in-store appearances. After returning, Buckley invited guitarist Michael Tighe to join the band and a collaboration between the two resulted in \\"So Real\\", a song which was recorded with producer/engineer Clif Norrell as a late addition to the album.Browne (2001), p. 227Browne (2001), p. 228 In June, Buckley began his first full band tour called the \\"Peyote Radio Theatre Tour\\" that lasted into August. The Pretenders‚Äò Chrissie Hynde,Browne (2001), p. 231 Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, and The Edge from U2Browne (2001), p. 251 were among the attendees of these early shows. Grace was released on August 23, 1994. In addition to seven original songs, the album included three covers: \\"Lilac Wine\\", based on the version by Nina Simone; made famous by Elkie Brooks, \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\", from Benjamin Britten's A Boy was Born, Op.3, a composition that Buckley was introduced to in high school, based on a 15th-century hymn;Browne (2001), p. 75 and \\"Hallelujah\\" by Leonard Cohen, based on John Cale's recording from the Cohen tribute album, I'm Your Fan. His rendition of \\"Hallelujah\\" has been called \\"Buckley's best\\" and \\"one of the great songs\\" by Time, and is included on Happy Mag's list of \\"The 10 Best Covers Of All Time\\", and Rolling Stones list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". Sales of Grace were slow, and it garnered little radio airplay despite critical acclaim. The Sydney Morning Herald proclaimed it \\"a romantic masterpiece\\" and a \\"pivotal, defining work\\". Despite slow initial sales the album went gold in France and Australia over the next two years, achieving gold status in the U.S. in 2002, and selling over six times platinum in Australia in 2006. Grace won appreciation from a host of revered musicians and artists, including members of Buckley's biggest influence, Led Zeppelin.Browne (2001), p. 10 Jimmy Page considered Grace close to being his \\"favorite album of the decade\\". Robert Plant was also complimentary, as was Brad Pitt, saying of Buckley's work, \\"There's an undercurrent to his music, there's something you can't pinpoint. Like the best of films, or the best of art, there's something going on underneath, and there's a truth there. And I find his stuff absolutely haunting. It just ... it's under my skin.\\" Others who had influenced Buckley's music lauded him: Bob Dylan named Buckley \\"one of the great songwriters of this decade\\", and, in an interview with The Village Voice, David Bowie named Grace as one of 10 albums he'd bring with him to a desert island. The album eventually went on to feature in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, appearing at No. 303. Concert tours Buckley spent much of the next year and a half touring internationally to promote Grace. From the album's release, he played in numerous countries, from Australia, to the UK (Glastonbury Festival and the 1995 Meltdown Festival at which he sang Henry Purcell's \\"Dido's Lament\\" at the invitation of Elvis Costello).Browne (2001), p. 266 Following Buckley's Peyote Radio Theater tour, the band began a European tour on August 23, 1994, starting with performances in the UK and Ireland. The tour continued in Scandinavia and, throughout September, numerous concerts in Germany were played. The tour ended on September 22 with a concert in Paris. A gig on September 24 in New York dovetailed on to the end of the European tour and Buckley and band spent the next month relaxing and rehearsing. A tour of Canada and the U.S. began on October 19, 1994 at CBGB's. The tour was far reaching with concerts held on both East and West Coasts of the U.S. and a number of performances in central and southern states. The tour ended two months later on December 18 at Maxwell's in Hoboken, New Jersey. After another month of rest and rehearsal, the band commenced a second European tour, this time mainly for promotion purposes. The band began the tour in Dublin; Buckley has remained particularly popular in Ireland. The short tour largely consisted of promotional work in London and Paris. In late January, the band did their first tour of Japan, playing concerts and appearing for promotion of the album and newly released Japanese single \\"Last Goodbye\\". The band returned to Europe on February 6 and toured various Western European countries before returning to the U.S. on March 6. Among the gigs performed during this period, Buckley and his band performed at a 19th-century-built French venue, the Bataclan, and material from the concert was recorded and later released in October of that year as a four track EP, Live from the Bataclan. Songs from a performance on February 25, at the venue Nighttown in Rotterdam, were subsequently released as a promotional-only CD, So Real. Touring recommenced in April with dates across the U.S. and Canada. During this period Buckley and the band notably played Metro in Chicago, which was recorded on video and later released as Live in Chicago on VHS and later on DVD. In addition, on June 4 they played at Sony Music Studios for the Sony Music radio hour. Following this was a month- long European tour between June 20 and July 18 in which they played many summer music festivals. During the tour, Buckley played two concerts at the Paris Olympia, a venue made famous by the French vocalist √âdith Piaf. Although he had failed to fill out smaller American venues at that point of his career, both nights at the large Paris Olympia venue were sold out.Liner notes, Live √† L'Olympia. Jeff Buckley (2001). Shortly after this Buckley attended the Festival de la Musique Sacr√©e (Festival of Sacred Music), also held in France, and performed \\"What Will You Say\\" as a duet with Alim Qasimov, an Azerbaijani mugham singer. Sony BMG has since released a live album, 2001's Live √† L'Olympia, which has a selection of songs from both Olympia performances and the collaboration with Qasimov. Buckley's Mystery White Boy tour, playing concerts in both Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, lasted between August 28 and September 6 and recordings of these performances were compiled and released on the live album Mystery White Boy. Buckley was so well received during these concerts that his album Grace went gold in Australia, selling over 35,000 copies, and taking this into account he decided a longer tour was needed and returned for a tour of New Zealand and Australia in February the following year. Between the two Oceanian tours, Buckley and the band took a break from touring. Buckley played solo in the meantime with concerts at Sin-√© and a New Year's Eve concert at Mercury Lounge in New York. After the break, the band spent the majority of February on the Hard Luck Tour in Australia and New Zealand, but tensions had risen between the group and drummer Matt Johnson. The concert on March 1, 1996 was the last gig he played with Buckley and his band. Much of the material from the tours of 1995 and 1996 was recorded and released on either promotional EPs, such as the Grace EP, or posthumously on albums, such as Mystery White Boy (a reference to Buckley not using his real name) and Live √† L'Olympia. Many of the other concerts Buckley played during this period have surfaced on bootleg recordings. Following Johnson's departure, the band, now without a drummer, was put on hold and did not perform live again until February 12, 1997. Due to the pressure from extensive touring, Buckley spent the majority of the year away from the stage. However, from May 2 to 5, he played a short stint as bass guitarist with Mind Science of the Mind, with friend Nathan Larson, then guitarist of Shudder to Think. Buckley returned to playing live concerts when he went on his \\"phantom solo tour\\" of caf√©s in the Northeast in December 1996, appearing under a series of aliases: the Crackrobats, Possessed by Elves, Father Demo, Smackrobiotic, the Halfspeeds, Crit-Club, Topless America, Martha & the Nicotines, and A Puppet Show Named Julio. By way of justification, Buckley posted a note on his Internet site stating that he missed the anonymity of playing in cafes and local bars:  Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk  After completing touring in 1996, Buckley started writing a new album, to be called My Sweetheart the Drunk. He worked with Patti Smith on her 1996 album Gone Again and met collaborator Tom Verlaine, the lead singer for the punk band Television. Buckley asked Verlaine to be producer on the new album and he agreed. In mid-1996, Buckley and his band began recording sessions in Manhattan with Verlaine. Eric Eidel played the drums through these sessions as a stop-gap between the dates drummer Matt Johnson left and before Parker Kindred joined as full-time drummer. Around this time Buckley met Inger Lorre of The Nymphs in an East Village bar,Browne (2001), p. 283 and struck up a fast and close friendship. Together, they contributed a track to Kerouac: Kicks Joy Darkness, a Jack Kerouac tribute album. After Lorre's backup guitarist for an upcoming album quit the project, Buckley offered to fill in.Browne (2001), p. 296 He became attached to one of the songs from the album, \\"Yard of Blonde Girls\\", and covered it on Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk.Browne (2001), p.315 Another recording session in Manhattan followed in early 1997, but Buckley and the band were unsatisfied. On February 4, 1997, Buckley played a short set at The Knitting Factory's tenth anniversary concert featuring a selection of his new songs: \\"Jewel Box\\", \\"Morning Theft\\", \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\", \\"The Sky is a Landfill\\" and \\"Yard of Blonde Girls\\".Browne (2001), p. 299 Lou Reed was there to watch and expressed an interest in working with Buckley. The band played their first gig with Parker Kindred, their new drummer, at Arlene's Grocery in New York on February 9. The set featured much of Buckley's new material that would appear on Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk and a recording has become one of Buckley's most widely distributed bootlegs. Later that month, Buckley recorded a spoken word reading of the Edgar Allan Poe poem, \\"Ulalume\\", for the album Closed on Account of Rabies. It was his last recording in New York; shortly after, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee. Buckley became interested in recording at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, at the suggestion of friend Dave Shouse from the Grifters.Browne (2001), p. 294 He rented a shotgun house there, of which he was so fond he contacted the owner about the possibility of buying it.Browne (2001), p. 1 Throughout this period, February 12 to May 26, 1997, Buckley played at Barristers', a bar located in downtown Memphis underneath a parking garage in an alley off Jefferson Avenue. He played numerous times in order to work through the new material in a live atmosphere, at first with the band then solo as part of a Monday night residency. In early February, Buckley and the band did a third recording session with Verlaine, in Memphis, but Buckley expressed his dissatisfaction with the sessions and later called Grace producer, Andy Wallace, to step in as Verlaine's replacement. Buckley started recording demos on his own 4-track recorder in preparation for a forthcoming session with Wallace. Some of these demos were sent to his band in New York, who listened to them enthusiastically, and were excited to resume working on the album. These recordings would go on to compose the second disc of Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. However Buckley was not entirely happy with the results and he sent his band back to New York while he stayed behind to work on the songs. The band was scheduled to return to Memphis for rehearsals and recording sessions on May 29.  Death  Wolf River Harbor, with Memphis, Tennessee, in background On the evening of May 29, 1997, Buckley's band flew to Memphis to join him in his studio to work on his new material. The same evening, Buckley went swimming fully dressed in Wolf River Harbor, a slack water channel of the Mississippi River, singing the chorus of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" by Led Zeppelin. Keith Foti, a roadie in Buckley's band, remained on shore. After moving a radio and guitar out of reach of the wake from a passing tugboat, Foti looked up to see that Buckley had vanished. A rescue effort that night and the morning after by scuba teams and police failed to discover him. On June 4, passengers on the American Queen riverboat spotted his body in the Wolf River caught in some branches, and he was brought to land. Buckley's autopsy showed no signs of drugs or alcohol in his system, and the death was ruled an accidental drowning. The official Jeff Buckley website published a statement saying that his death was not mysterious and was not a suicide. =Tributes= Graffiti memorial by fans in Russia, 2015 * One-time friend Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins recorded the Massive Attack song \\"Teardrop\\" on the day he died, and later stated: \\"That was so weird ...

Musical style Buckley's voice was a particularly distinguished aspect of his music. He possessed a tenor vocal range that spanned around four octaves. Buckley made full use of this range in his performance, particularly in the songs from Grace, and reached peaks of high G in the tenor range at the culmination of \\"Grace\\". \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" was sung nearly entirely in a high falsetto. The pitch and volume of his singing was also highly variable, as songs such as \\"Mojo Pin\\" and \\"Dream Brother\\" began with mid-range quieter vocals before reaching louder, higher peaks near the ending of the songs.Dillon, Jared W. (May 26, 2006). Jeff Buckley Grace . Sputnik Music. Retrieved on February 13, 2012. Buckley played guitar in a variety of styles ranging from the distorted rock of \\"Sky is a Landfill\\", to the jazz of \\"Strange Fruit\\", the country styling of \\"Lost Highway\\", and the guitar fingerpicking style in \\"Hallelujah\\". He occasionally used slide guitar in live performances as a solo act and used a slide for the introduction of \\"Last Goodbye\\" when playing with a full band. His songs were written in various guitar tunings which, apart from the EADGBE standard tuning, included Drop D tuning and an Open G tuning. His guitar playing style varied from highly melodic songs, such as \\"The Twelfth of Never\\", to more percussive ones, such as \\"New Year's Prayer\\".Jeff Buckley: Grace and Other Songs-Guitar Tab Edition-Music Book.

Continuum. . = Equipment = Buckley mainly played a 1983 Fender Telecaster and a Rickenbacker 360/12, but also used several other guitars, including a black Gibson Les Paul Custom and a 1967 Guild F-50 acoustic. When on tour with his band, he used Fender Amplifiers for a clean sound and Mesa Boogie amps for his overdriven tones. He was primarily a singer and guitarist; however, he also played other instruments on various studio recordings and sessions, including bass, dobro, mandolin, harmonium (heard on the intro to \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\"), organ, dulcimer (\\"Dream Brother\\" intro), tabla, esraj, and harmonica. Personal life Shortly before recording Grace, Buckley was roommates with actress Brooke Smith. In 1994‚Äì95, Buckley had an intense relationship with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins. At the time of his death, Buckley was in a relationship with Joan Wasser, to whom he had reportedly proposed marriage.  Legacy  After Buckley's death, a collection of demo recordings and a full-length album he had been reworking for his second album were released as Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk the compilation being overseen by his mother, Mary Guibert, band members and old friend Michael J. Clouse, as well as Chris Cornell. The album achieved gold sales in Australia in 1998. Three other albums composed of live recordings have also been released, along with a live DVD of a performance in Chicago. A previously unreleased 1992 recording of \\"I Shall Be Released\\", sung by Buckley over the phone on live radio, was released on the album For New Orleans. Since his death, Buckley has been the subject of numerous documentaries: Fall in Light, a 1999 production for French TV; Goodbye and Hello, a program about Buckley and his father produced for Netherlands TV in 2000; and Everybody Here Wants You, a documentary made in 2002 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). An hour-long documentary about Buckley called Amazing Grace: Jeff Buckley has been shown at various film festivals to critical acclaim. The film was released worldwide in 2009 by Sony BMG Legacy as part of the Grace Around The World Deluxe Edition. In the spring of 2009 it was revealed that Ryan Jaffe, best known for scripting the movie The Rocker, had replaced Brian Jun as screenwriter for the upcoming film Mystery White Boy. Orion Williams is also set to co-produce the film with Michelle Sy. A separate project involving the book Dream Brother was allegedly cancelled. Buckley's premature death inspired many artists he knew or influenced to write songs in tribute to the late singer. PJ Harvey knew him personally and in the song \\"Memphis\\" she takes lines from a song on his unfinished album, \\"Morning Theft\\", and in her own words reflects on Buckley's death: \\"In Memphis ... die suddenly, at a wonderful age, we're ready to go\\". Chris Cornell wrote \\"Wave Goodbye\\", which appeared on his first solo album, Euphoria Morning, for Buckley. Rufus Wainwright, whose fledgling career had barely started when he met Buckley, wrote \\"Memphis Skyline\\" in tribute to him, singing \\"then came hallelujah sounding like Ophelia, for me in my room living, turn back and you will stay, under the Memphis Skyline\\". Duncan Sheik's \\"A Body Goes Down\\", from his 1998 album Humming, was a response to Buckley's death. Steve Adey wrote a song tribute entitled \\"Mississippi\\" on his 2006 album All Things Real. The song contains the lyrics \\"Until the morning thief steals the humming of the Lord\\", a reference to Buckley's song \\"Morning Theft\\".Steve Adey ‚Äì All Things Real . Stylusmagazine. Retrieved on February 13, 2012. In May and June 2007, Buckley's life and music were celebrated globally with tributes in Australia, Canada, UK, France, Iceland, Israel, Ireland, Republic of Macedonia, Portugal and the U.S. Many of Buckley's family members attended the various tribute concerts across the globe, some of which they helped organize. There are three annual Jeff Buckley tribute events: the Chicago-based Uncommon Ground, featuring a three-day concert schedule, An Evening With Jeff Buckley, an annual New York City tribute, and the Australia-based Fall In Light. The latter event is run by the Fall In Light Foundation, which in addition to the concerts, runs a \\"Guitars for Schools\\" program. The name of the foundation is taken from the lyrics of Buckley's \\"New Year's Prayer\\". In 2015, tapes of a 1993 recording session for Columbia Records were discovered by Sony executives doing research for the 20th anniversary of Grace. The recordings have been released on an album, You and I, in March 2016 and it features mostly covers of songs recorded previously by other artists. In 2012, at Toronto International Film Festival, Greetings from Tim Buckley premiered; the film explores the relationship Jeff Buckley had with his father. Buckley is referenced in the 2001 film Vanilla Sky, when Sofia asks David if he would rather listen to Jeff Buckley or Vikki Carr, to which he responds, \\"Both. Simultaneously.\\" As David is leaving Sofia's apartment, the music playing is the intro to Jeff Buckley's song \\"Last Goodbye\\", from his 1994 studio album Grace. =Resurgence= On March 7, 2008, Buckley's version of the Leonard Cohen song \\"Hallelujah\\" went to No. 1 on the iTunes chart, selling 178,000 downloads for the week, after being performed by Jason Castro on the seventh season of the television series American Idol. The song debuted at No. 1 that week on Billboards Hot Digital Songs chart, giving Buckley his first No. 1 on any Billboard chart. In a similar vein, the 2008 UK X Factor winner, Alexandra Burke, released a cover of \\"Hallelujah\\" with the intent to top the UK Singles Chart as the Christmas number one single. Buckley fans countered this, launching a campaign with the aim of propelling Buckley's version to the number one spot. Burke's version eventually reached Christmas Number One on the UK charts in December 2008. Buckley's version of the song entered the UK charts at No. 49 on November 30, and by December 21 it had reached No. 2 despite the fact that it had not been rereleased in a physical format.

It was marketed by Eastman Kodak under the brand name Advantix, by FujiFilm under the name Nexia, by Agfa under the name Futura and by Konica as Centuria.  Design  A typical low-end, fixed-focus APS compact camera The film is 24 mm wide, and has three image formats: * H for \\"High Definition\\" (30.2 √ó 16.7 mm; aspect ratio 16:9; 4√ó7\\" print) (1.25 crop compared to 36x24mm full frame) * C for \\"Classic\\" (25.1 √ó 16.7 mm; aspect ratio 3:2; 4√ó6\\" print) (1.44 crop compared to 36x24mm full frame) * P for \\"Panoramic\\" (30.2 √ó 9.5 mm; aspect ratio 3:1; 4√ó11\\" print) (1.36 crop compared to 36x24mm full frame) The \\"C\\" and \\"P\\" formats are formed by cropping the 30.2 √ó 16.7 mm \\"High Definition\\" image. The full image is recorded on the film, and an image recorded in one aspect ratio can be reprinted in another. The \\"C\\" format has an equivalent aspect ratio to a 135 film image. Most APS cameras (with the exception of some disposable cameras) can record all three formats; the format selection is indicated on the film by a series of exposed squares alongside the image area or recorded on the magnetic coating depending on the camera. In the absence of an operator-specified format, the machine printing an APS roll will use these indicators to determine the output format of each print.  Film and cartridge  Visual indicators on an APS cartridge The film is on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) base, and is housed in a single-spool 39 mm long plastic cartridge. The basic diameter is 21 mm, while it measures 30 mm at the slot where the film exits. The slot is protected by a lightproof door. It is available in 40, 25 and 15 exposure lengths. The film surface has a transparent magnetic coating, and the camera uses this information exchange (IX) system for recording information about each exposure. The camera handles winding and rewinding automatically, to the extent that partially exposed films can, in certain cameras, be removed and used later. Numbered symbols (called 'visual indicators') on the cartridge end indicate the status: # Full circle: Unexposed # Half circle: Partly exposed # Cross sign: Fully exposed but not processed # Rectangle: Processed Additionally, a tab on this end of the cartridge indicates that the cartridge has been processed.  Information exchange  A major distinction of APS film was the ability to record information other than the image. This information exchange was most commonly used for print aspect ratio, but could also be used to record the date and time that the photograph was taken, store a caption, and record exposure data such as shutter speed and aperture setting. This information could be read by the photo printing equipment to determine the print aspect ratio, print information on the back (or, rarely, the front) of the photograph, or to improve print quality. Two methods for storing information on the film were employed: \\"magnetic IX\\" and \\"optical IX\\". Optical IX was employed on less expensive cameras and disposable cameras, and employed a light source to expose a small section of the film, outside of the image negative area. This method was limited to determining the print aspect ratio of the finished print. Magnetic IX was used in the more expensive cameras and allowed for more information exchange. Most cameras with magnetic IX automatically recorded the exposure date and time on the magnetic layer, with more advanced models allowing the user to specify a predetermined caption to be printed on the photo or record the exposure settings, as well as determine print aspect ratio. Magnetic IX caused some problems for photo processors, who found their magnetic reading heads had to be cleaned frequently, or that their equipment's ability to print this information was limited.  Processing  Unlike 135 film, processed (developed) APS film is stored in the original cartridge. For identification, every roll of APS film has a six-digit ID code on the label, which is also stored magnetically and is visible on either end of the processed negative. This ID is usually printed on the back of every individual print. This ID was designed to be an additional convenience both for the photoprocessor (who can easily match each strip of processed film with its cartridge, and each cartridge to a particular customer's order) and for the consumer, who can easily locate the correct cartridge if reprints are desired. To facilitate automatic processing of film, a unique DX number is assigned to the different types of film. APS film is typically processed by using a small machine to transfer the exposed APS film from the original cartridge to a reloadable one, then re-attached to the original cartridge and rewound using another machine after processing. An IX240 negative strip  Cameras  The Nikon Pronea 600i The format was introduced in 1996 by Kodak, Fujifilm, Minolta, Nikon, Canon and others. APS was mainly used for point and shoot amateur cameras, although some SLR systems were also created: Canon EOS IX, Minolta Vectis, Nikon Pronea with Nikon IX lenses. Of these the Canon EOS IX and the Nikon Pronea could use the existing 35 mm SLR lenses, whereas Minolta opted to create a new lens line-up later shared with an early digital SLR. Nikon developed the IX series of lens that were lighter and had a smaller image circle (similar to the Nikon DX format used since 2004). Although the Nikon IX series of lenses were not compatible with the Nikon 35 mm SLR, lenses for the Nikon 35 mm SLR were compatible with the Nikon Pronea. Using existing lenses meant that the field of view was reduced by around 1.6√ó, but had the advantage of a larger lens selection. Creating a new lens system on the other hand gave the possibility of creating smaller and lighter lenses as they had a smaller image circle to cover. APS SLR cameras were too expensive for the high-end amateur market when they first appeared, and professional photographers stuck with 35 mm cameras, which offered greater image quality and resolution. Presently the terms APS-C and APS-H are most often used in reference to various makes of digital SLR that contain imaging sensors that are (very) roughly equivalent to their respective film dimensions given above (see Crop factor). Concurrently to their APS SLR film cameras, some manufacturers released lenses intended for use on APS film cameras - such as the Canon EF 22-55mm - which had a wider field of view to account for the relative-to-35mm crop factor. Some of these lenses have survived and are now marketed towards use on \\"APS\\" digital SLRs for the same reason. In reference to digital cameras, APS may also mean active pixel sensor, a type of CMOS image sensor.  Adoption  An APS camera The Advanced Photo System was an attempt of a major upgrade of photographic technology for amateurs, but was soon overtaken by the popularity of digital photography. Despite the added features, APS never really caught on with professional photographers because of the significantly smaller film area (58% of 135 film). Color slide film, popular with professional photographers, proved unpopular in APS format and was soon discontinued (although chromogenic black-and-white IX240 film continued to be produced). Color print film was normally available only in a limited selection of film speeds. These developments, combined with the fact that auto-loading 35mm cameras could be made almost as compact, as convenient, and as inexpensive as APS-format cameras, prevented APS from attaining greater popularity. APS cameras found most of their success among the consumer point and shoot camera market, but this was too little too late: within five years of the format's launch, sales had dropped significantly. This was mainly due to the increasing quality and falling prices of digital cameras. In January 2004, Kodak announced it was ceasing APS camera production. Both Fuji and Kodak, the last two manufacturers of APS film, discontinued production in 2011.http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=1096&pq- locale;=en_GB&_requestid=17859  See also  *  Film formats * Film format * List of color film systems * List of film formats * Panoramic photography  References   External links  * Reviews and comments on APS * Photos of disassembled APS cassette and Elph/Ixus camera Film formats Audiovisual introductions in 1996 ","title":"Advanced Photo System"},{"id":"173708","text":"Al-Seerat an-Nabawiyyah (), commonly shortened to Seerah, and translated as prophetic biography, are the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad from which, in addition to the Quran and trustable Hadiths, most historical information about his life and the early period of Islam is derived. Ibn Ishaq's sƒ´rat ras≈´l allƒÅh has been preserved in the form of an edited copy of his oral reports collected by one of his students, al-Bakka'i, which were further edited by ibn Hisham.Guillaume, A. The Life of Muhammad, translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sira Rasul Allah, (Oxford, 1955) Of the other authors of sira, none of their books have survived to this day although some quotations and hadith have. Etymology In the Arabic language the word sƒ´ra or sƒ´rat () comes from the verb sƒÅra, which means to travel or to be on a journey. A person's sƒ´ra is that person‚Äôs journey through life, or biography, encompassing their birth, events in their life, manners and characteristics, and their death. In modern usage it may also refer to a person's resume. It is sometimes written as \\"seera\\", \\"sirah\\" or \\"sirat\\", all meaning \\"life\\" or \\"journey\\". In Islamic literature, the plural form, siyar, could also refer to the rules of war and dealing with non-Muslims. The phrase sƒ´rat ras≈´l allƒÅh, or al-sƒ´ra al-nabawiyya, refers to the study of the life of Muhammad. The term sƒ´ra was first linked to the biography of Muhammad by Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri, and later popularized by the work of Ibn Hisham. In the first two centuries of Islamic history, sƒ´ra was more commonly known as maghƒÅzƒ´ (literally, stories of military expeditions), which is now considered to be only a subset of sƒ´ra \\\\-- one that concerns the military campaigns of Muhammad. Early works of sƒ´ra consist of multiple historical reports, or akhbƒÅr, and each report is called a khabar. Sometimes the word tradition or hadith is used instead. Content The sƒ´ra literature includes a variety of heterogeneous materials, containing mainly narratives of military expeditions undertaken by Muhammad and his companions. These stories are intended as historical accounts and are used for veneration. The sƒ´ra also includes a number of written documents, such as political treaties (e.g., Treaty of Hudaybiyyah or Constitution of Medina), military enlistments, assignments of officials, letters to foreign rulers, and so forth. It also records some of the speeches and sermons made by Muhammad, like his speech at the Farewell Pilgrimage. Some of the sƒ´ra accounts include verses of poetry commemorating certain events and battles. At later periods, certain type of stories included in sƒ´ra developed into their own separate genres. One genre is concerned with stories of prophetic miracles, called a ølƒÅm al-nubuwa (literally, \\"proofs of prophethood\\"‚Äîthe first word is sometimes substituted for amƒÅrƒÅt or dalƒÅ æil). Another genre, called fa·∏çƒÅ æil wa mathƒÅlib ‚Äî tales that show the merits and faults of individual companions, enemies, and other notable contemporaries of Muhammad. Some works of sƒ´ra also positioned the story of Muhammad as part of a narrative that includes stories of earlier prophets, Persian Kings, pre-Islamic Arab tribes, and the Rashidun. Parts of sƒ´ra were inspired by, or elaborate upon, events mentioned in the Qur'an. These parts were often used by writers of tafsir and asbab al-nuzul to provide background information for events mentioned in certain ayat. Comparison to hadith In terms of structure, a hadith and a historical report (khabar) are very similar; they both contain isnads (chains of transmission). The main difference between a hadith and a khabar is that a hadith is not concerned with an event as such, and normally does not specify a time or place. Rather the purpose of hadith is to record a religious doctrine as an authoritative source of Islamic law. By contrast, while a khabar may carry some legal or theological implications, its main aim is to convey information about a certain event. Starting from the 8th and 9th century, many scholars have devoted their efforts to both kinds of texts equally. Some historians consider the sƒ´ra and maghƒÅzƒ´ literature to be a subset of Hadith. Reception During the early centuries of Islam, the sƒ´ra literature was taken less seriously compared to the hadiths. In Umayyad times, storytellers (qƒÅ·π£·π£, pl. qu·π£·π£ƒÅ·π£) used to tell stories of Muhammad and earlier prophets in private gatherings and mosques, given they obtained permission from the authorities. Many of these storytellers are now unknown. After the Umayyad period, their reputation deteriorated because of their inclination to exaggerate and fantasize, and for relying on the Isra'iliyat. Thus they were banned from preaching at mosques. In later periods, however, works of sƒ´ra became more prominent. More recently, Western historical criticism and debate concerning sƒ´ra have elicited a defensive attitude from some Muslims who wrote apologetic literature defending its content. Authenticity For centuries, Muslim scholars have recognized the problem of authenticity of hadith. Thus they have developed sophisticated methods (see Hadith studies) of evaluating isnƒÅds (chains of transmission). This was done in order to classify each hadith into \\"sound\\" (·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏•) for authentic reports, as opposed to \\"weak\\" (·∏ça øƒ´f) for ones that are probably fabricated, in addition to other categories. Since many sƒ´ra reports also contain isnƒÅd information and some of the sƒ´ra compilers (akhbƒÅrƒ´s) were themselves practicing jurists and hadƒ´th transmitters (mu·∏•addiths), it was possible to apply the same methods of hadƒ´th criticism to the sƒ´ra reports. However, some sƒ´ra reports were written using an imprecise form of isnƒÅd, or what modern historians call the \\"collective isnƒÅd\\" or \\"combined reports\\". The use of collective isnƒÅd meant that a report may be related on the authority of multiple persons without distinguishing the words of one person from another. This lack of precision led some hadith scholars to take any report that used a collective isnƒÅd to be lacking in authenticity. According to Wim Raven, it is often noted that a coherent image of Muhammad cannot be formed from the literature of sƒ´ra, whose authenticity and factual value have been questioned on a number of different grounds. He lists the following arguments against the authenticity of sƒ´ra, followed here by counter arguments: # Hardly any sƒ´ra work was compiled during the first century of Islam. However, Fred Donner points out that the earliest historical writings about the origins of Islam first emerged in AH 60-70, well within the first century of Hijra (see also List of biographies of Muhammad). Furthermore, the sources now extant, dating from the second, third, and fourth centuries AH, are mostly compilations of material derived from earlier sources.Raven, W., ‚ÄúSƒ´ra‚Äù, in: Brill Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, v.9 p.662 # The many discrepancies exhibited in different narrations found in sƒ´ra works. Yet, despite the lack of a single orthodoxy in Islam, there is still a marked agreement on the most general features of the traditional origins story. # Later sources claiming to know more about the time of Muhammad than earlier ones. Scholar Patricia Crone found a pattern, where the farther a commentary was removed in time from the life of Muhammad and the events in the Quran, the more information it provided, despite the fact it depended on the earlier sources for its content. Crone attributed this phenomenon to storytellers' embellishment. > If one storyteller should happen to mention a raid, the next storyteller > would know the date of this raid, while the third would know everything that > an audience might wish to hear about. In the case of Ibn Ishaq, there are no earlier sources we can consult to see if and how much embroidering was done by him and other earlier transmitters, but, Crone argues, \\"it is hard to avoid the conclusion that in the three generations between the Prophet and Ibn Ishaq\\" fictitious details were not also added. # Discrepancies compared to non-Muslim sources. But there are also similarities and agreements both in information specific to Muhammad, and concerning Muslim tradition at large. # Some parts or genres of sƒ´ra, namely those dealing with miracles, do not qualify as sources for scientific historiographical information about Muhammad, except for showing the beliefs and doctrines of his community. Nevertheless, other content of sƒ´ra, like the Constitution of Medina, are generally considered to be authentic. Early compilations of sƒ´ra The following is a list of some of the early Hadith collectors who specialized in collecting and compiling sƒ´ra and maghƒÅzƒ´ reports: *  øUrwa ibn al-Zubayr (d. 713). He wrote letters replying to inquiries of the Umayyad caliphs, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and al-Walid I, involving questions about certain events that happened in the time of the Prophet. Since Abd al-Malik did not appreciate the maghƒÅzƒ´ literature, these letters were not written in story form. He is not known to have written any books on the subject. * Wahb ibn Munabbih (d. during 725 to 737). Several books were ascribed to him but none of them are now extant. Some of his works survive as quotations found in works by Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Hisham, Ibn Jarir al- Tabari, and Ab≈´ Nu øaym al-I·π£fahƒÅnƒ´. * Ibn ShihƒÅb al-Zuhrƒ´ (d. c. 737), a central figure in sƒ´ra literature, who collected both ahadith and akhbƒÅr. His akhbƒÅr also contain chains of transmissions, or isnad. He was sponsored by the Umayyad court and asked to write two books, one on genealogy and another on maghƒÅzƒ´. The first was canceled and the one about maghƒÅzƒ´ is either not extant or has never been written. * Musa ibn  øUqba, a student of al-Zuhrƒ´, wrote KitƒÅb al-MaghƒÅzƒ´, a notebook used to teach his students; now lost. Some of his traditions have been preserved, although their attribution to him is disputed. * Muhammad ibn Ishaq (d. 767 or 761), another student of al-Zuhrƒ´, who collected oral traditions that formed the basis of an important biography of the Prophet. His traditions survived through a number of sources, most notably Ibn Hisham and Ibn Jarir al-Tabari.

Biographies of Muhammad Islamic terminology ","title":"Prophetic biography"},{"id":"173709","text":"Edwin Herbert Land, ForMemRS, FRPS, Hon.MRI (May 7, 1909 ‚Äì March 1, 1991) was an American scientist and inventor, best known as the co-founder of the Polaroid Corporation. He invented inexpensive filters for polarizing light, a practical system of in-camera instant photography, and the retinex theory of color vision, among other things. His Polaroid instant camera went on sale in late 1948 and made it possible for a picture to be taken and developed in 60 seconds or less.  Life and career  Edwin Land was born Jewish in Bridgeport, Connecticut to Matie () and Harry Land, a Russian scrap-metal dealer. Growing up, he was known to take apart household appliances, such as a mantel clock and the family's new gramophone, as well as blowing all the house's fuses when he was six years old. Land attended the Norwich Free Academy at Norwich, Connecticut, a semi-private high school, and graduated in the class of 1927. The library there was posthumously named for him, having been funded by grants from his family. He studied chemistry at Harvard University but left after his freshman year, moving to New York City. There he invented the first inexpensive filters capable of polarizing light, which he called Polaroid film. He was not associated with an educational institution and lacked the tools of a proper laboratory, making this a difficult endeavor, so he would sneak into a laboratory at Columbia University late at night to use their equipment. He also availed himself of the New York Public Library to scour the scientific literature for prior work on polarizing substances. His breakthrough came when he realized that, instead of attempting to grow a large single crystal of a polarizing substance, he could manufacture a film with millions of micron-sized polarizing crystals that were coaxed into perfect alignment with each other. Land returned to Harvard University after developing the polarizing film, but he did not finish his studies or receive a degree. According to biographer Peter Wensberg, once Land could see the solution to a problem in his head, he lost all motivation to write it down or prove his vision to others. Often his wife would extract from him the answers to homework problems, at the prodding of his instructor. She would then write up the homework and hand it in so that he could receive credit and not fail the course. =Polaroid= In 1932, he established the Land-Wheelwright Laboratories together with his Harvard physics instructor, George Wheelwright, to commercialize his polarizing technology. Wheelwright came from a family of financial means and agreed to fund the company. After a few early successes developing polarizing filters for sunglasses and photographic filters, Land obtained funding from a series of Wall Street investors for further expansion. The company was renamed the Polaroid Corporation in 1937. Land further developed and produced the sheet polarizers under the Polaroid trademark. Although the initial major application was for sunglasses and scientific work, it quickly found many additional applications: for color animation in the Wurlitzer 850 Peacock jukebox of 1942, for glasses in full-color stereoscopic (3-D) movies, to control brightness of light through a window, a necessary component of all LCDs, and many more. During World War II, he worked on military tasks, which included developing dark-adaptation goggles, target finders, the first passively guided smart bombs, and a special stereoscopic viewing system called the Vectograph which revealed camouflaged enemy positions in aerial photography. A little more than three years later, on February 21, 1947, Land demonstrated an instant camera and associated film to the Optical Society of America. Called the Land Camera, it was in commercial sale less than two years later. Polaroid originally manufactured sixty units of this first camera. Fifty-seven were put up for sale at the Jordan Marsh department store in Boston before the 1948 Christmas holiday. Polaroid marketers incorrectly guessed that the camera and film would remain in stock long enough to manufacture a second run based on customer demand. All fifty- seven cameras and all of the film were sold on the first day of demonstrations. During his time at Polaroid, Land was notorious for his marathon research sessions. When Land conceived of an idea, he would experiment and brainstorm until the problem was solved with no breaks of any kind. He needed to have food brought to him and to be reminded to eat. He once wore the same clothes for eighteen consecutive days while solving problems with the commercial production of polarizing film. As the Polaroid company grew, Land had teams of assistants working in shifts at his side. As one team wore out, the next team was brought in to continue the work. Elkan Blout, a close colleague of Edwin Land at Polaroid, wrote: \\"What was Land like? Knowing him was a unique experience. He was a true visionary; he saw things differently from other people, which is what led him to the idea of instant photography. He was a brilliant, driven man who did not spare himself and who enjoyed working with equally driven people.\\"Blout, E.R., 1996. \\"Polaroid: Dreams to Reality\\" in The Power of Boldness, ed. by E.R. Blout, Joseph Henry Press, pp. 60‚Äì75. =Contributions to photo intelligence= Beginning in the early years of the Cold War, Land played a major role in the development of photographic reconnaissance and intelligence gathering efforts. Projects included the Genetrix balloon borne cameras, the U-2 program, Corona and Samos photographic satellites, and the Manned Orbiting Laboratory. He was a frequent advisor to President Dwight D. Eisenhower on photographic reconnaissance matters. =Later years= In the 1950s, Edwin Land and his team helped design the optics of the revolutionary Lockheed U-2 spy plane. Also in this decade, Land first discovered a two-color system for projecting the entire spectrum of hues with only two colors of projecting light (he later found more specifically that one could achieve the same effect using very narrow bands of 579 nm and 599 nm light). Some of this work was later incorporated in his Retinex theory of color vision. In 1957, Harvard University awarded him an honorary doctorate, and Edwin H. Land Blvd., a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was later named in his memory. The street is at one end of Memorial Drive, in Cambridge, where the Polaroid company headquarters building was located (over a mile west on Memorial Drive from Land Blvd.). Polaroid occupied several buildings in various places in Cambridge. In the early 1970s, Land attempted to explain the previously known phenomenon of color constancy with his retinex theory. His popular demonstrations of color constancy raised much interest in the concept. He considered his leadership towards the development of integral instant color photography ‚Äî the SX-70 film and camera ‚Äî to be his crowning achievement. Although he led the Polaroid Corporation as a chief executive, Land was a scientist first and foremost, and as such made sure that he performed \\"an experiment each day\\". Despite the fact that he held no formal degree, employees, friends, and the press respected his scientific accomplishments by calling him Dr. Land. The only exception was the Wall Street Journal, which refused to use that honorific title throughout his lifetime. Land often made technical and management decisions based on what he felt was right as both a scientist and a humanist, much to the chagrin of Wall Street and his investors. From the beginning of his professional career, he hired women and trained them to be research scientists. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, he led Polaroid to the forefront of the affirmative action movement. He had an artistic vision. In his laboratory he built giant studio cameras the size of bedroom closets that produced large format (20 x 24 inch) prints. He gave photographers free access to these cameras in return for some of the prints they produced. This practice was continued by the company; the result was the Polaroid Collection. Compiled since the 1970s, the collection grew to between 16,000 and 24,000 photos shot by some of the world's greatest artists and photographers, including Ansel Adams, Chuck Close, Robert Frank and Andy Warhol. The collection, an asset of the Polaroid Corporation, remained intact until 2010 when, in controversial circumstances, it was broken up and put up for sale in lots. Despite the tremendous success of his instant cameras, Land's unsuccessful Polavision instant movie system was a financial disaster,Giambarba, Paul (2004-09-01)\\"The Last Hurrah ‚Äì Polavision, 1977\\", \\"The Branding of Polaroid 1957‚Äì1977\\".

In his retirement years, Land founded the Rowland Institute for Science. =Death= Edwin Land died on March 1, 1991 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the age of 81. Land's family declined to disclose the cause of his death. Land himself disliked being written about, wanting to leave behind a legacy of published scientific work, rather than a cult of personality, and so, on his death, Land's family had a laboratory associate shred his personal papers and notes, a task that would take three years to complete. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. =Public service= Land was:Garwin, Richard L., \\"EDWIN H.

He received the Pulitzer Prize for his The Soul of a New Machine (1981), about the creation of a new computer at Data General Corporation. He has received praise and awards for other works, including his biography of Paul Farmer, a doctor and anthropologist, titled Mountains Beyond Mountains (2003). Kidder is considered a literary journalist because of the strong story line and personal voice in his writing. He has cited as his writing influences John McPhee, A. J. Liebling, and George Orwell. In a 1984 interview he said, \\"McPhee has been my model. He's the most elegant of all the journalists writing today, I think.\\" Kidder wrote in a 1994 essay, \\"In fiction, believability may have nothing to do with reality or even plausibility. It has everything to do with those things in nonfiction. I think that the nonfiction writer's fundamental job is to make what is true believable.\\" Early life and education John Tracy Kidder was born November 12, 1945, in New York City. He graduated from Phillips Academy in 1963. He attended Harvard College, originally majoring in political science, but switching to English after taking a course in creative writing from Robert Fitzgerald. He received an AB degree from Harvard in 1967. Kidder served in the United States Army as a first lieutenant, Military Intelligence, Vietnam, from 1967 to 1969. After returning from Vietnam, he wrote for some time and was admitted to the Iowa Writers' Workshop. He received an MFA degree from the University of Iowa in 1974. Career Kidder wrote his first book, The Road to Yuba City: a Journey into the Juan Corona Murders, while at the University of Iowa. The Atlantic Monthly commissioned the work, and he continued writing as a freelancer for the magazine during the 1970s. The Road to Yuba City was a critical failure, and Kidder said in a 1995 interview that > I can't say anything intelligent about that book, except that I learned > never to write about a murder case. The whole experience was disgusting, so > disgusting, in fact, that in 1981 I went to Doubleday and bought back the > rights to the book. I don't want The Road to Yuba City to see the light of > day again. Kidder has said that, unlike many other writers, he was not much influenced by his Vietnam experience: \\"Of course, whenever you're in an experience like Vietnam, it is bound to influence your work; it's inevitable, but I really don't think it greatly shaped me as a writer.\\" His works for Atlantic Monthly include several essays and short stories about the Vietnam War, including \\"The Death of Major Great\\" (1974), \\"Soldiers of Misfortune\\" (1978), and \\"In Quarantine\\" (1980). Writing in 1997, David Bennett rated these three pieces \\"among the finest reporting to come out of Vietnam.\\" Kidder's second book, The Soul of a New Machine (1981), was much more successful than his first. His account of the complex community and environment of programming and computer development won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1982. He has continued to write nonfiction books and articles, and these have been well received by the critics. Kidder's 2009 book, Strength in What Remains, is a portrait of a man who survived the genocide in Burundi. He has explored a wide range of topics through his books, House (1985), a \\"biography\\" of a couple having their first house built, and the people involved in the project; Among Schoolchildren (1989), set in an elementary-school classroom in Holyoke, Massachusetts and reflecting on US education through the lives of these 20 children and their teacher (these two books were both bestsellers); and Old Friends (1993), which explored the daily lives and personal growth of a pair of elderly men in a nursing home. His books have made \\"Notable\\" annual lists of The New York Times and received positive praise from critics, in addition to awards. In fall 2010 Kidder was selected as the first A.M. Rosenthal Writer-in-Residence at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. At the center, he worked with his onetime editor at The Atlantic, Richard Todd, on a book about writing, titled Good Prose: The Art of Nonfiction. He lectured to students and did research to identify his next narrative subject.

Disc film is a discontinued still-photography film format that was aimed at the consumer market. It was introduced by Kodak in 1982. The film is in the form of a flat disc, and is fully housed within a plastic cartridge. Each disc holds fifteen 10 √ó 8 mm exposures, arranged around the outside of the disc, with the disc being rotated 24¬∞ between each image. The system was a consumer-oriented product, and most cameras are self-contained units with no expansion capability. The disc film allows them to be compact and considerably thinner than other cameras. The cameras are very simple to load and unload, and are generally completely automated. The cassette has a built-in dark slide to prevent stray light reaching the film when the disc is removed. As the film is rotated on a disc instead of over a spool, the cassette is very thin. The flat nature of the format also led to the potential advantage of greater sharpness over curved spool-based cassette formats (such as Minox film, 110 and 126 film). Disc film has a very thick acetate base, comparable thickness with 4√ó5\\" sheet film, which holds the film much flatter than the other formats of the time. Disc film did not prove hugely successful, mainly because the image on the negative is only 10 mm by 8 mm, leading to generally unacceptable grain and poor definition in the final prints from the analog imaging equipment used at the time. The film was intended to be printed with special 6-element lenses from Kodak, but many labs simply printed discs with standard 3-element lenses used for larger negative formats. The resulting prints often disappointed the consumer. Few labs made the investment required to get the best out of the small negative size. A problem with labs of the time was the manual nature of processing the color negative film. This was essentially a manual process, unlike spool-based films, whose chemical processing could be fully automated. The film was officially discontinued by the last manufacturer, Kodak, on December 31, 1999, though the cameras had disappeared from the market long before then. There were several different manufacturers of Disc film. Kodak produced films throughout the complete lifespan of the format, but 3M, Konica and Fuji also produced Disc film. While Kodak film was always eponymous, 3M and Konica made Disc film for many third parties, branded with the retailer's logo. As with most photographic film, for such white-label products the country of manufacture provides the best indication as to the actual manufacturer. The 1983 \\"Minolta Disc-7\\" camera introduced a predecessor of the selfie stick - a convex mirror on its front to allow the composition of self-portraits, and its packaging showed the camera mounted on a stick while used for such a purpose. In 2012, H√®rm Hofmeyer in The Netherlands and Film Rescue International in Canada cooperatively developed a method to produce fresh disc films, and about 30 fresh B&W; and colour discs were made. A detailed protocol on how to manufacture such discs at home was released in 2020 .

He is thus one of the most mentioned people in the Quran by reference; 25 times by the name Isa, third-person 48 times, first-person 35 times, and the rest as titles and attributes.Isa (25 times): 2:87, 2:136, 2:253, 3:45, 3:52, 3:55, 3:59, 3:84, 4:157, 4:163, 4:171, 5:46, 5:78, 5:110, 5:112, 5:114, 5:116, 6:85, 19:34, 33:7, 42:13, 43:63, 57:27, 61:6, 61:14.Messiah (Christ) / Ibn Maryam (23 times): 2:87, 2:253, 3:45, 4:157, 4:171, 5:17, 5:46, 5:72, 5:75, 5:78, 5:110, 5:112, 5:114, 5:116, 9:31, 19:34, 23:50, 33:7, 43:57, 57:27, 61:6, 61:14; Messiah / Al Masih (11 times): 3:45, 4:171, 4:172, 5:17, 5:72(2), 5:75, 9:30, 9:31; Spirit (of God) / rwh (11 times): 2:87, 2:253, 4:171, 5:110, 12:87, 15.29, 17:85(2), 19:17, 21:91, 58:22; child / pure boy (9 times): 19:19, 19:20, 19:21, 19:29, 19:35, 19:88, 19:91, 19:92, 21:91; Word (of God) / kalima (6 times): 3:39, 3:45, 3:48, 4:171, 5:46, 5:110; Messenger / Apostle / Prophet (5 times): 3:49, 4:157, 4:171, 19:30, 61:6; Sign (4 times): 19:21, 21:91, 23:50, 43:61; The Gift (1 time): 19:19; Mercy from Us (1 time): 19:21; Servant (1 time): 19:30; Blessed (1 time): 19:31; Word of Truth ~ Statement of Truth (1 time): 19:34; amazing thing ~ thing unheard of (1 time): 19:27; Example (1 time): 43:57; Straight Path ~ Right Way (1 time): 43:61; Witness (1 time): 4:159; His Name (1 time): 3:45.Parrinder 1965, p. 16.3rd person \\"He / Him / Thee\\" etc. (48 times): 2:87, 2:253, 3:46(2), 3:48, 3:52, 3:55(4), 4:157(3), 4.159(3), 5:110(11), 5:46(3), 5:75(2), 19:21, 19:22(2), 19:27(2), 19:29, 23:50, 43:58(2), 43:59(3), 43:63, 57:27(2), 61:6. The Quran and most hadiths (testimonial reports) mention Jesus to have been born a \\"pure boy\\" (without sin) to Mary () as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity. The Quran denies Jesus as a deity in several verses, including one and mentions that Jesus did not claim to be divine (Q.5:116). According to the Quran, he was neither crucified nor raised from the dead, but was rather saved by God. (Although the earliest Islamic traditions and exegesis quote somewhat conflicting reports regarding a death and its length, Muslims believe that Jesus did not die on the cross, but still believe that he was raised alive to heaven).Parrinder 1965, p. 61.Over the centuries, Muslim writers have referenced other miracles like casting out demons, having borrowed from some heretical pre-Islamic sources, and from canonical sources as legends about Jesus were expanded. In Islam, Jesus is believed to have been the precursor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is also called a Muslim, as he preached that his followers should adopt the \\"straight path\\". In Islamic eschatology, Jesus returns in a Second Coming to fight the Al-Masih ad-Dajjal or \\"False Messiah\\" and establish peace on earth. Birth of Jesus Jesus' lineage, going back to his great-grandfather The account of Jesus begins with a prologue narrated several times in the Quran first describing the birth of his mother, Mary, and her service in the Jerusalem temple, while under the care of the prophet and priest Zechariah, who was to be the father of John the Baptist. The birth narrative in the Quran for Jesus begins at Maryam (19) 16‚Äì34 and al-Imran (3) 45‚Äì53. The birth narrative has been recounted with certain variations and detailed additions by Islamic historians over the centuries. While Islamic theology affirms Mary as a pure vessel regarding the virgin birth of Jesus, it does not follow the concept of Immaculate Conception as related to Mary's birth in some Christian traditions.Cleo McNelly Kearns. (2008), The Virgin Mary, Monotheism and Sacrifice, New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 254‚Äì55 =Annunciation= Islamic exegesis affirms the virginal birth of Jesus similarly to the Gospel account and occurring in Bethlehem. The narrative of the virgin birth is an announcement to Mary by the angel Gabriel while Mary is being raised in the Temple after having been pledged to God by her mother. Gabriel states she is honored over all women of all nations and has brought her glad tidings of a holy son. A hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah (d. 681), an early companion of the Prophet, quotes Muhammad explaining that both Jesus and Mary were protected from Satan's touch at birth; a quoting of Al Imran 3:36. The Annunciation in miniature The angel declares the son is to be named Jesus, the Messiah, proclaiming he will be called a great prophet, and is the Spirit of God and Word of God, who will receive al-Injƒ´l (Arabic for the gospel). The angel tells Mary that Jesus will speak in infancy, and when mature, will be a companion to the most righteous. Mary, asking how she could conceive and have a child when no man had touched her, was answered by the angel that God can decree what He wills, and it shall come to pass. The conception of Jesus as described by Ibn Arabi (d. 1240), an Andalusian scholar, Sufi mystic, poet and philosopher, in the Bezels of Wisdom: Pseudo-Arabic on the Christ Child's blanket, Gentile da Fabriano The narrative from the Quran continues with Mary, overcome by the pains of childbirth, being provided a stream of water under her feet from which she could drink and a palm tree which she could shake so ripe dates would fall and be enjoyed. After giving birth, Mary carries baby Jesus back to the temple and she is asked by the temple elders about the child. Having been commanded by Gabriel to a vow of silence, she points to the infant Jesus and the infant proclaims: Jesus speaking from the cradle is one of six miracles attributed to him in the Quran. The speaking infant theme is also found in the Syriac Infancy Gospel, a pre-Islamic sixth-century work. =Birth narratives= According to the Quran, the pains of labor took Mary to the trunk of a palm tree. The Islamic faith echoed some strands within the Christian tradition that Mary (or Maryam) was a literal virgin when Jesus was conceived. The most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus is provided in Surah 3 (Al Imran) and 19 (Maryam) of the Quran where the story is narrated that God (Allah) sent an angel to announce that Maryam could shortly expect to bear a son, despite being a virgin.Sarker, Abraham,Understand My Muslim People, 2004, , p. 260. Some academics have noted that the account in Surah 19 is particularly close to that in the Christian Gospel of Luke.Jackson, Montell, Islam Revealed, 2003, , p. 73. The Annunciation to Mary is mentioned twice in the Quran and in both instances Mary/ Maryam is told that she was chosen by God to deliver a son. In the first instance, the bearer of the news (who is believed by most Muslims to be the archangel Gabriel), delivered the news in (3:42-47) as he takes the form of a man (19:16-22).Jestice, Phyllis G., Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia, Volume 1, 2004, , pp. 558‚Äì559 The details of the conception are not discussed but when Mary asks how she can bear a son in view of her chastity she is told that God creates what he wills and that these things are easy for God. The Quran (21:91 and 66:12) says that God blew through his angel into Mary and she, although being chaste bore Jesus without any father. Ibn Ishaq (d. 761 or 767), an Arab historian and hagiographer, wrote the account entitled Kitab al-Mubtada (In the Beginning), reporting that Zechariah is Mary's guardian briefly, and after being incapable of maintaining her, he entrusts her to a carpenter named George. Secluded in a church, she is joined by a young man named Joseph, and they help one another fetching water and other tasks. The account of the birth of Jesus follows the Quran's narrative, adding that the birth occurred in Bethlehem beside a palm tree with a manger. Al-Tabari (d. 923), a Persian scholar and historian, contributed to the Jesus birth narrative by mentioning envoys arriving from the king of Persia with gifts (similar to the Magi from the east) for the Messiah; the command to a man called Joseph (not specifically Mary's husband) to take her and the child to Egypt and later return to Nazareth. Childhood The Quran does not include the tradition of the Flight into Egypt, though s≈´ra XXIII, 50 could conceivably allude to it: \\"And we made the son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and we made them abide in an elevated place, full of quiet and watered with springs.\\"A. J. Wensinck and Penelope C. Johnstone, \\"Maryam\\", in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, ed. by P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs. Consulted online on 30 September 2018. , . However, narratives similar to the narrative found in the Gospels and non-canonical sources circulated in later Islamic tradition, with some details and elaborations being added over the centuries by Islamic writers and historians. Some narratives have Jesus and family staying in Egypt up to 12 years. Many moral stories and miraculous events of Jesus' youth are mentioned in Qisas al-anbiya (Stories of the Prophets), books composed over the centuries about pre-Islamic prophets and heroes. Al-Masudi wrote that Jesus as a boy studied the Jewish religion reading from the Psalms and found \\"traced in characters of light\\": with Jesus then claiming: =In Egypt= Several narratives show some disparity and similarity in Islamic writings about Jesus' early childhood, specifically his time in Egypt with regard to duration and events. Most of the narratives are found in non-canonical Christian sources like, for example, the pre-Islamic Gospel of Thomas. One such disparity is from al-Athir in his The Perfection of History which contains a birth narrative stating Jesus was born in Egypt instead of Bethlehem. Some other narratives of Jesus' childhood are popular Middle Eastern lore as highlighted by professor of interfaith studies Mahmoud M. Ayoub. Many miracles are attributed to a young Jesus while in Egypt (see ¬ß¬ß Miracles and Other miracles). Adulthood The Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized by Yahya ibn Zakariya (John the Baptist). =Mission= It is generally agreed that Jesus spoke Aramaic, the common language of Judea in the first century A.D. and the region at-large. The first and earliest view of Jesus formulated in Islamic thought is that of a prophet ‚Äì a human being chosen by God to present both a judgment upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one true God. From this basis, reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus is considered no more than a messenger repeating a repetitive message of the ages. The miracles of Jesus and the Quranic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus ‚Äì the same power behind the message of all prophets. Some Islamic traditions believe Jesus' mission was only to the people of Israel and his status as a prophet being confirmed by numerous miracles.Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 83. A second early high image of Jesus is an end-time figure. This concept arises mostly from the Hadith. Muslim tradition constructs a narrative similarly found in Christian theology, seeing Jesus arriving at the end of time and descending upon earth to fight the Antichrist. This narrative is understood to champion the cause of Islam, with some traditions narrating Jesus pointing to the primacy of Muhammad. Most traditions state Jesus will then die a natural death.Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 84. A third and distinctive image is of Jesus representing an ascetic figure ‚Äì a prophet of the heart. Although the Quran refers to the 'gospel' of Jesus, those specific teachings of his are not mentioned in the Quran or later religious texts. They are largely absent. The Sufi tradition is where Jesus became revered, acknowledged as a spiritual teacher with a distinctive voice from other prophets, including Muhammad. Sufism tends to explore the dimensions of union with God through many approaches, including asceticism, poetry, philosophy, speculative suggestion, and mystical methods. Although Sufism to the Western mind may seem to share similar origins or elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Buddhism, the ideology is distinctly Islamic since they adhere to the words of the Quran and pursue imitation of Muhammad as the perfect man.Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 85. =Preaching= The Islamic concepts of Jesus' preaching is believed to have originated in Kufa, Iraq, under the Rashidun Caliphate where the earliest writers of Muslim tradition and scholarship was formulated. The concepts of Jesus and his preaching ministry developed in Kufa was adopted from the early ascetic Christians of Egypt who opposed official church bishopric appointments from Rome. The earliest stories, numbering about 85, are found in two major collections of ascetic literature entitled Kitab al- Zuhd wa'l Raqa'iq (The Book of the Asceticism and Tender Mercies) by Ibn al- Mubarak (d. 797), and Kitab al-Zuhd (The Book of Asceticism) by Ibn Hanbal (d. 855). These sayings fall into four basic groups: a) eschatological sayings; b) quasi-Gospel sayings; c) ascetic sayings and stories; d) sayings echoing intra-Muslim polemics.Khalidi 2001, p. 31. The first group of sayings expands Jesus' archetype as portrayed in the Quran. The second group of stories, although containing a Gospel core, are expanded with a \\"distinctly Islamic stamp\\". The third group, being the largest of the four, portrays Jesus as a patron saint of Muslim asceticism. The last group builds upon the Islamic archetype and Muslim-centric definition of Jesus and his attributes, furthering esoteric ideas regarding terms such as \\"Spirit of God\\" and \\"Word of God\\".Khalidi 2001, p. 32-36. Miracles At least six miracles are attributed to Jesus in the Quran, with many more being added over the centuries by writers and historians. Miracles were attributed to Jesus as signs of his prophethood and his authority, according to educator and professor Ishaq Musa Al-Husayni (d. 1990), an author most known for Mudhakkirat Dajaja (Memoirs of a Hen) (Cairo: Dar al-Maarif, 1943; 2nd ed. 1967). In Christ in the Quran and in Modern Arabic Literature (1960), Al-Husayni said it is noteworthy Muhammad attributes no miracles to himself.Parrinder 1965, p. 83. These six miracles in the Quran are without detail unlike the Gospel and their non-canonical sources, which include details and mention other attributed miracles. Over the centuries, these six miracle narratives have been elaborated through Hadith and poetry, with religious writings including some of the other miracles mentioned in the Gospel, non-canonical sources, and from lore. =Speaking from the cradle= Speaking from the cradle is mentioned in three places in the Quran: al-Imran (3) 41, 46, al-Maida (5) 109‚Äì110 and Maryam (19) 29‚Äì30. Part of the narrative has the infant Jesus defending his mother Mary from the accusation of having given birth without a known husband.Parrinder 1965, p. 78. Early Islam was unclear about Joseph and his role. Jesus speaks as the angel Gabriel had mentioned at the annunciation: Jesus proclaims he is a servant of God, has been given a book, is a prophet, is blessed wherever he will go, blesses the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he is raised alive.Parrinder 1965, p. 75‚Äì76. Although this particular narrative is not found in the Bible, the theme of speaking from the cradle is found in the non-canonical pre-Islamic Syriac Infancy Gospel. That source has Jesus declaring himself the Son of God, the Word, and affirming what the angel Gabriel had previously announced to Mary as detailed in the Gospel. =Creating birds from clay= The miracle of creating birds from clay and breathing life into them when a child is mentioned in al-Imran (3) 43, 49 and al-Maida (5) 109‚Äì110. Although this miracle is also not mentioned the canonical Gospel, the same narrative is found in at least two pre-Islamic sources: the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and the Jewish Toledot Yeshu, with few variant details between the Quran and these two sources.Parrinder 1965, p. 83‚Äì84. =Healing the blind and the leper= Similar to the New Testament, the Quran mentions Jesus healing the blind and the lepers in al-Imran (3) 49. Muslim scholar and judge al-Baydawi (d. 1286) wrote how it was recorded that many thousands of people came to Jesus to be healed, and that Jesus healed these diseases through prayer only.Parrinder 1965, p. 85. Medieval scholar al- Tha'labi wrote about how these two particular diseases were beyond medical help, and Jesus' miracles were meant to be witnessed by others as clear signs of his message. =Raising the dead= Jesus is believed to have raised people from the dead, as mentioned in al-Imran (3) 49. Although no detail is given as to who was raised or the circumstance, at least three people are mentioned in detail in the Gospel (a daughter of Jairus, a widow's son at Nain, and Lazarus).Parrinder 1965, p. 86. =Prescience= Jesus was able to predict, or had foreknowledge, of what was hidden or unknown to others. One example is Jesus would answer correctly any and every question anyone asked him. Another example is Jesus knew what people had just eaten, as well as what they had stored in their homes. =Table of food from heaven= In the fifth chapter of the Quran, al-Ma'ida (5) 112‚Äì115, a narration mentions the disciples of Jesus requesting a table laden with food, and for it to be a special day of commemoration for them in the future. This may be a possible reference to the Eucharist according to professor of Islamic and Arabic studies W. Montgomery Watt (d. 2006). According to professor of comparative religions Geoffrey Parrinder (d. 2005), it is unclear if this story parallels the Gospel's Last Supper or the feeding the multitude, but may be tied to the Arabic word  øƒ´d (Muslim festival):Parrinder 1965, p. 87. In a record by the Sunni exegete Tabari, before the last supper, the threat of death made him anxious. Therefore, Jesus invited his disciples for a last supper. After the meal, he washed their hands and performed their ablutions to wipe their hands on his clothing. Afterwards Jesus replied to them: \\"As for that I have done to you tonight, in that I served you the meal and washed your hands in person, let it be an example for you. Since you indeed consider me to be better than you, do not be haughty in relation to each other but rather expand yourselve for each other as I have expanded myself for you.\\" After instructing the disciples in his teachings, Jesus foretells that one of them would deny him and another betray him. However, in accordance with Islamic denial of crucifixion, just a corpse in semblance of Jesus was caught and crucified and Jesus himself was raised to God.Neal Robinson, Christ in Islam and Christianity, SUNY Press 1991 p 129 =Other miracles= Many stories and narratives have been developed over the years about Jesus, containing certain inherent lessons or providing meaning due to the lack of detail in the Quran regarding Jesus. Some of these narratives are similar in nature to the New Testament, while some portray Jesus in a very human manner. Besides some detail summaries of miracles of Jesus mentioned by Muslim writers over the centuries, from adulthood (like walking on water ‚Äì also found in the Gospel ‚Äì and causing loaves of bread to come from the ground), some other miracles from childhood include: explaining the Muslim creed fundamentals to a schoolmaster, revealing who the thieves were to a wealthy chief, filling empty jars of something to drink, providing food and wine for a tyrannical king while also proving to this king his power in raising a dead man from the dead, raising a child accidentally killed, and causing the garments from a single-colored vat to come out with various colors. Healing a royal official's son Al-Tabari (d. 923) reports a story of an adult Jesus' encounter with a certain king in the region and the healing of his son. The identity of the king is not mentioned while legend suggests Philip the Tetrarch. The corresponding Bible reference is \\"the royal official's son\\". Greed and truth-telling A legendary story of a miracle by a young Jesus, used as a hard-learned lesson popularly found in Middle Eastern lore according to professor Ayoub, has to do with a Jewish man and loaves of bread. Although carrying a polemic tone, the lesson centers on greed with truth-telling weaved into the narration. It is a story found often in children's books. Inherent wisdom Another legendary miracle story is one regarding Jesus' childhood wisdom. This legend, reported through al- Tabari from ibn Ishaq, talks about Mary sending Jesus to a religious school and the teacher being astonished to find Jesus already knowing the information being taught / discussed. Food in children's homes Another story from al-Tabari tells of a young Jesus playing with the youths of his village and telling them what food their parents were preparing for them at home. According to the details of the narrative, some parents became annoyed and forbade their children to play with Jesus, suspecting he was a magician. As a result, the parents kept their children away from Jesus and gathered their children into a single house. One day, feeling lonely, Jesus went out looking for his friends, and coming upon this house he asked the parents where their children were. The parents lied, responding that the children were not there. After Jesus asks who, then, is in the house, the parents call Jesus a pig. Jesus then says \\"Let there be swine in this house\\", turning all the children into swine. Revelation Muslims believe that God revealed to Jesus a new scripture, al-Injƒ´l (the Gospel), while also declaring the truth of the previous revelations: al-Tawrat (the Torah) and al-Zabur (the Psalms). The Quran speaks favorably of al-Injƒ´l, which it describes as a scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and piety. Traditional Islamic exegesis claiming the biblical message to have been distorted or corrupted (tahrif), is termed ta'yin al-mubham (\\"resolution of ambiguity\\"). This polemic effort has its origins in the medieval period with Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad's writings. Regarding the Law of Moses, the Quran indicates that Jesus never abolished Jewish laws but rather confirmed them, while making partial abrogations only. Islam rejects Paul's theology of justification before God by faith alone as held by some Protestants or faith through grace as held by Catholics, Orthodox and most mainline Protestants. Jesus' legal perspective did not involve a New Covenant concerning works, but to simply modify those existing laws. Shabir Ally considers this understanding to corroborate with the canonical gospels that include Matthew 5:17. According to Yusuf al- Qaradawi in his book The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, the legal restrictions Jesus abrogated for Jews where those initially legislated by God as a punishment. Classical commentaries such as Tafsir al-Jalalayn specify they pertained to the consumption of fish and bird meat without spikes, or in general. Disciples The Quran states that Jesus was aided by a group of disciples who believed in His message. While not naming the disciples, the Quran does give a few instances of Jesus preaching the message to them. According to Christianity, the names of the twelve disciples were Peter, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James, Jude, Simon, and Judas. The Quran mentions in chapter 3, verses 52‚Äì53, that the disciples submitted to the faith of Islam: The longest narrative involving Jesus' disciples is when Jesus performs the miracle of bringing a table of food from heaven at their request, for further proof that his preaching is the true message. Death The primary Quranic verse dealing with the event of the crucifixion is Surah 4 Verse 157: Most Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir argue in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view. Professor and scholar Mahmoud M. Ayoub pr up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments: Some disagreement and discord can be seen beginning with Ibn Ishaq's (d. 761) report of a brief accounting of events leading up to the crucifixion, firstly stating that Jesus was replaced by someone named Sergius, while secondly reporting an account of Jesus' tomb being located at Medina and thirdly citing the places in the Quran (3:55; 4:158) that God took Jesus up to himself. An early interpretation of verse 3:55 (specifically \\"I will cause you to die and raise you to myself\\"), Al- Tabari (d. 923) records an interpretation attributed to Ibn 'Abbas, who used the literal \\"I will cause you to die\\" (mumayyitu-ka) in place of the metaphorical mutawaffi-ka \\"Jesus died\\", while Wahb ibn Munabbih, an early Jewish convert, is reported to have said \\"God caused Jesus, son of Mary, to die for three hours during the day, then took him up to himself.\\" Tabari further transmits from Ibn Ishaq: \\"God caused Jesus to die for seven hours\\",Zahniser 2008, page 56 while at another place reported that a person called Sergius was crucified in place of Jesus. Ibn-al-Athir forwarded the report that it was Judas, the betrayer, while also mentioning the possibility it was a man named Natlianus. Al-Masudi (d. 956) reported the death of Christ under Tiberius. Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) follows traditions which suggest that a crucifixion did occur, but not with Jesus.Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 119. After the event, Ibn Kathir reports the people were divided into three groups following three different narratives; The Jacobites believing \\"God remained with us as long as He willed and then He ascended to Heaven\\"; the Nestorians believing \\"The son of God was with us as long as he willed until God raised him to heaven\\"; and the Muslims believing \\"The servant and messenger of God, Jesus, remained with us as long as God willed until God raised him to Himself.\\"Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 121. Another report from Ibn Kathir quotes Ishaq Ibn Bishr, on authority of Idris, on authority of Wahb ibn Munabbih, that \\"God caused him to die for three days, then resurrected him, then raised him.\\"Robinson 1991, p. 122.Ayoub 1980, p. 108. [Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Shawkani, Fath al-Qadir al-Jami bayn Fannay al-Riwaya wa 'l Diraya min 'Ilm al-Tqfsir (Cairo: Mustafa al-Babi al- Halabi, n.d.), I, 346, citing Ibn Asakir, who reports on the authority of Ibn Munabbih.] Michael Cook notes that denial that Jesus died follows the Christian heresy of Docetism, who were \\"disturbed by that God should have died\\", but that this concern conflicts with another Islamic doctrine, that Jesus was a man, not God. Quranic commentators seem to have concluded the denial of the crucifixion of Jesus by following material interpreted in Tafsir that relied upon extra-biblical Judeo-Christian sources,Lawson 2009, page 12 with the earliest textual evidence having originated from a non-Muslim source; a misreading of the Christian writings of John of Damascus regarding the literal understandings of Docetism (exegetical doctrine describing spiritual and physical realities of Jesus as understood by men in logical terms) as opposed to their figurative explanations.Lawson 2009, page 7. John of Damascus highlighted the Quran's assertion that the Jews did not crucify Jesus being very different from saying that Jesus was not crucified, explaining that it is the varied Quranic exegetes in Tafsir, and not the Quran itself, that denies the crucifixion, further stating that the message in the 4:157 verse simply affirms the historicity of the event.Lawson 2009, page 12. Ja'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman (d. 958), Abu Hatim Ahmad ibn Hamdan al-Razi (d. 935), Abu Yaqub al- Sijistani (d. 971), Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi (d. 1078) and the group Ikhwan al-Safa also affirm the historicity of the Crucifixion, reporting Jesus was crucified and not substituted by another man as maintained by many other popular Quranic commentators and Tafsir. In reference to the Quranic quote \\"We have surely killed Jesus the Christ, son of Mary, the apostle of God\\", Muslim scholar Mahmoud Ayoub asserts this boast not as the repeating of a historical lie or the perpetuating of a false report, but an example of human arrogance and folly with an attitude of contempt towards God and His messenger(s). Ayoub furthers what modern scholars of Islam interpret regarding the historical death of Jesus, the man, as man's inability to kill off God's Word and the Spirit of God, which the Quran testifies were embodied in Jesus Christ. Ayoub continues highlighting the denial of the killing of Jesus as God denying men such power to vanquish and destroy the divine Word. The words, \\"they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him\\" speaks to the profound events of ephemeral human history, exposing mankind's heart and conscience towards God's will. The claim of humanity to have this power against God is illusory. \\"They did not slay him ...but it seemed so to them\\" speaks to the imaginations of mankind, not the denial of the actual event of Jesus dying physically on the cross.Ayoub 1980, p. 117. Islamic reformer Muhammad Rashid Rida agrees with contemporary commentators interpreting the physical killing of Christ's apostleship as a metaphorical interpretation.Ayoub 1980, p. 113. =Substitution= It is unclear exactly where the substitutionist interpretation originated, but some scholars consider the theory originating among certain Gnostic groups of the second century. Leirvik finds the Quran and Hadith to have been clearly influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia. Muslim commentators have been unable to convincingly disprove the crucifixion. Rather, the problem has been compounded by adding the conclusion of their substitutionist theories. The problem has been one of understanding.Ayoub 1980, p. 116. While most Western scholars,Crossan, John Dominic (1995). Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography. HarperOne. p. 145. . \\"That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both Josephus and Tacitus ... agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact.\\" Jews, and Christians believe Jesus died, orthodox Muslim theology teaches he ascended to Heaven without being put on the cross and God transformed another person, Simon of Cyrene, to appear exactly like Jesus who was crucified instead of Jesus (cf. Irenaeus' description of the heresy of Basilides, Book I, ch. XXIV, 4.). Ascension Modern Islamic scholars like Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i interpret the ascension of Jesus as spiritual, not physical. This interpretation is in accord with Mu øtazila and Shia metaphorical explanations regarding anthropomorphic references to God in the Quran. Although not popular with traditional Sunni interpretations of the depiction of crucifixion, there has been much speculation and discussion in the effort of logically reconciling this topic.Ayoub 1980, p. 100. In ascetic Shia writings, Jesus is depicted having \\"ascended to heaven wearing a woolen shirt, spun and sewed by Mary, his mother. As he reached the heavenly regions, he was addressed, 'O Jesus, cast away from you the adornment of the world.Ayoub 1980, p. 103. Second coming According to Islamic tradition which describes this graphically, Jesus' descent will be in the midst of wars fought by al-Mahdi (lit. \\"the rightly guided one\\"), known in Islamic eschatology as the redeemer of Islam, against al-Masih ad-Dajjal (the Antichrist \\"false messiah\\") and his followers.Sonn (2004) p. 209 Jesus will descend at the point of a white arcade, east of Damascus, dressed in yellow robes‚Äîhis head anointed. He will say prayer behind al-Mahdi then join him in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist, and then everyone who is one of the People of the Book (ahl al-kitƒÅb, referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam. Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 43: Kitab-ul-\`Ilm (Book of Knowledge), H√¢dith Number 656: After the death of al-Mahdi, Jesus will assume leadership. This is a time associated in Islamic narrative with universal peace and justice. Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (known also as Gog and Magog), ancient tribes which will disperse and cause disturbance on earth. God, in response to Jesus' prayers, will kill them by sending a type of worm in the napes of their necks, and send large birds to carry and clear their corpses from the land. Jesus' rule is said to be around forty years, after which he will die. Muslims will then perform the funeral prayer for him and then bury him in the city of Medina in a grave left vacant beside Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar (companions of Muhammad and the first and second Sunni caliphs (Rashidun) respectively. Islamic theology Jesus is described by various means in the Quran. The most common reference to Jesus occurs in the form of Ibn Maryam (son of Mary), sometimes preceded with another title. Jesus is also recognized as a nabƒ´ (prophet) and ras≈´l (messenger) of God. The terms \`abd-AllƒÅh (servant of God), wadjih (\\"worthy of esteem in this world and the next\\") and mubƒÅrak (\\"blessed\\", or \\"a source of benefit for others\\") are all used in reference to him. Islam sees Jesus as human, sent as the last prophet of Israel to Jews with the Gospel scripture, affirming but modifying the Mosaic Law. Mainstream traditions have historically rejected any divine notions of Jesus being God, or begotten Son of God, or the Trinity. Popular theology teaches such beliefs constitute shirk (the \\"association\\" of partners with God) and thereby a rejection of his divine oneness (tawhid) as the sole unpardonable sin.See: *Esposito (2002) p. 32, 74; *Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241 *Markham and Ruparell (2001) p. 348 A widespread polemic directed to these doctrinal origins are ascribed to Paul the Apostle, regarded by some Muslims as a heretic, as well as an evolution across the Greco-Roman world causing pagan influences to corrupt God's revelation. The theological absence of Original Sin in Islam renders the Christian concepts of Atonement and Redemption as redundant. Jesus simply conforms to the prophetic mission of his predecessors. Jesus is understood to have preached salvation through submission to God's will and worshipping God alone. Islam teaches Jesus will ultimately deny claiming divinity. Thus, he is considered to have been a Muslim by the religious definition of the term (i.e., one who submits to God's will), as understood in Islam regarding all other prophets that preceded him.Khalidi 2001 p. 75; *Fasching, deChant (2001) p. 241 Jesus and Mary in old Persian miniature. A frequent title of Jesus mentioned is al-Masƒ´·∏•, which translates to \\"the Messiah\\", as well as Christ. Although the Quran is silent on its significance, scholars disagree with the Christian concepts of the term, and lean towards a Jewish understanding. Muslim exegetes explain the use of the word masƒ´h in the Quran as referring to Jesus' status as the one anointed by means of blessings and honors; or as the one who helped cure the sick, by anointing the eyes of the blind, for example. Jesus also holds a description as both a word from God and a soul.https://quran.com/4/171 The interpretation behind Jesus as a spirit from God, is seen as his human soul. Some Muslim scholars occasionally see the spirit as the archangel Gabriel, but majority consider the spirit to be Jesus himself.Mufti Shafi Uthmani, Maariful Quran, Q. 19:16-21, Volume 6, p. 34. =Similitude with Adam= The Quran emphasizes the creationism of Jesus, through his similitude with Adam in regards to the absence of human origin. Islamic exegesis extrapolates a logical inconsistency behind the Christian argument of divine intervention, as such implications would have ascribed divinity to Adam who is understood only as creation. =Precursor to Muhammad= Muslims believe that Jesus was a precursor to Muhammad, and that he prophesied the latter's coming. This perspective is based on a verse of the Quran wherein Jesus speaks of a messenger to appear after him named \\"Ahmad\\".Quran 61:06 Islam associates Ahmad with Muhammad, both words deriving from the h-m-d triconsonantal root which refers to praiseworthiness. Muslims assert that evidence of Jesus' pronouncement is present in the New Testament, citing the mention of the Paraclete whose coming is foretold in the Gospel of John. Muslim commentators claim that the original Greek word used was periklutos, meaning famed, illustrious, or praiseworthy‚Äîrendered in Arabic as Ahmad; and that this was replaced by Christians with parakletos. This idea is debated, asking if the traditional understanding is supported by the text of the Quran. Islamic theology claims Jesus had foretold another prophet succeeding him according to Sura 61:6, with the mention of the name Ahmad. (Ahmad is an Arabic name from the same triconsonantal root ·∏§-M-D = [ÿ≠ - ŸÖ - ÿØ].) In responding to Ibn Ishaq's biography of Muhammad, the Sirat Rasul Allah, Islamic scholar Alfred Guillaume wrote: =Messianism= An alternative, more esoteric, interpretation is expounded by Messianic Muslims in the Sufi and Isma'ili traditions so as to unite Islam, Christianity and Judaism into a single religious continuum. Other Messianic Muslims hold a similar theological view regarding Jesus, without attempting to unite the religions. Making use of the New Testament's distinguishing between Jesus, Son of Man (being the physical human Jesus), and Christ, Son of God (being the Holy Spirit of God residing in the body of Jesus), the Holy Spirit, being immortal and immaterial, is not subject to crucifixion ‚Äî for it can never die, nor can it be touched by the earthly nails of the crucifixion, for it is a being of pure spirit. Thus, while the spirit of Christ avoided crucifixion by ascending unto God, the body that was Jesus was sacrificed on the cross, thereby bringing the Old Testament to final fulfillment. Thus Quranic passages on the death of Jesus affirm that while the Pharisees intended to destroy Jesus completely, they, in fact, succeeded only in killing the Son of Man, being his nasut (material being). Meanwhile, the Son of God, being his lahut (spiritual being) remained alive and undying ‚Äî because it is the Holy Spirit.Encyclopedia of Islam, Jesus article. cf. L. Massignon, Le Christ dans les √âvangiles selon Ghazali, in REI, 1932, 523-36, who cites texts of the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa, a passage of Abu Hatim al-Razi (about 934), and another of the Isma'ili da'i Mu'ayyad fid-din al-Shirazi (1077). Islamic literature Muhammad leads Jesus, Abraham, Moses and others in prayer. Medieval Persian miniature.alt=Muhammad, surrounded by fire, is depicted on the right. Jesus and others are on the left The Quran does not convey the specific teachings of Jesus. What has developed over the years was authored by later followers of Islam. What is found in the Quran about Jesus is that his teaching conformed to the prophetic model: a human sent by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one true God. In the case of Jesus, Muslims believe that his mission was to the people of Israel and that his status as a prophet was confirmed by numerous miracles.Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 90. The Quran's description of specific events at the end of Jesus‚Äô life have continued to be controversial between Christians and Muslims, while the classical commentaries have been interpreted differently to accommodate new information. Jesus is written about by some Muslim scholars as the perfect man.Parrinder 1965, p. 6. =Hadith= The Hadith are reported sayings of Muhammad and people around him. The Hadith containing Jesus legend have been influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia. The Hadith developed a canonical status in the third Muslim century as a source of authority for the Muslim community. The Muslim perception of Jesus emerging from the Hadith is of a miraculous, sinless, and eschatological figure, pointing people, again according to the Muslim's perspective of prophethood, to the Muslim faith (Muslim; one who submits to the will of God).Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 97. Hadith have played a very important part shaping Jesus' image among common Muslims, having become further developed when incorporating Hadiths and Tafsirs weaved into great amounts of legendary writings and reports. With the Muslim reshaping, the void of Jesus is surprising. What is instead written about is the ascetic magician, helped by the Holy Spirit. The Gospel is seen as a book to be preached and is only referred to in passing without mentioning actual teachings. Strikingly, the fictitious sayings and supposed teachings of Jesus are given preeminence in Hadith-collections, in Shia Islam, and in Sufi representations of Jesus. =Sunnism= In Kitab al- Milal wa al-Nihal, al-Shahrastani (d. 1153), an influential Persian historian, historiographer, scholar, philosopher and theologian, records a portrayal of Jesus very close to the orthodox tenets while continuing the Islamic narrative: > The Christians. (They are) the community (umma) of the Christ, Jesus, son of > Mary (peace upon him). He is who was truly sent (as prophet; mab'uth) after > Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him were > (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of the > dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and innate > disposition (fitra) are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, his > coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. For > all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age of) > forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the > cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at > (the age of) thirty. The duration of his (prophetic) mission (da'wa) was > three years and three months and three days. =Shiism= According to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, the great grandchild of Muhammad, between David and Jesus there were 400 years. The religion of Jesus was 'tawhid' (divine unity), 'ikhlas' (purity) and what Noah, Abraham and Moses had professed. The 'Injil' (Gospel) was sent down to him and the pledge that other prophets took was also taken from Jesus: to establish prayer with religion, enjoin the good and forbid the evil, allowing what is allowed and forbidding what has been forbidden. Admonitions and parables were sent down to him in the 'Injil', but there was no law of retribution in it nor precepts of retribution (ahkam al-hudud), and no obligations for inheritance. He was sent what was an alleviation of what was sent down to Moses in the Torah. (see al- Imran 50) Jesus commanded of his followers that they believe in the law of the Torah and the 'Injil'. =Sufism= Early Sufis adopted the sayings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount and an ascetic dimension. The submission and sacrifice Jesus exemplified shows the Muslim is to be set apart from worldly compromises. In poetry and mysticism, Jesus was celebrated as a prophet close to the heart of God achieving an uncommon degree of self-denial.name=\\"Gregg, Stephen 2010, p. 85\\" Although the writings developed over the centuries embellished Jesus‚Äô miracles, the lessons of Jesus can be seen as metaphors of the inner life. These rich and diverse presentations of Jesus in Sufi traditions are the largest body of Jesus-texts in any non-Christian tradition.Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 86. The miraculous birth and life of Jesus becomes a metaphor for Rumi of the spiritual rebirth that is possible within each human soul. This rebirth is not achieved without effort; one needs to practice silence, poverty, and fasting‚Äîthemes that were prominent in Jesus‚Äô life according to Islamic traditions.Gregg, Stephen; Barker, Gregory 2010, p. 112. Ibn Arabi stated Jesus was Al-InsƒÅn al-KƒÅmil, the spirit and simultaneously a servant of God. Jesus is held to be \\"one with God\\" in whole coincidence of will, not as a being. Due to the spirit of God dwelling in Jesus, God spoke and acted through him. Yet Jesus is not considered to be God, but a person within God's word and spirit and a manifestation of God's attributes, like a mirror.Clinton Bennett Understanding Christian-Muslim Relations: Past and Present A&C; Black 2008 page 155 =Ahmadiyya= The Ahmadiyya Movement considers Jesus was a prophet and a mortal man, who was crucified and remained on the cross for six hours, until darkness fell. Jesus was taken down from the cross alive and unconscious. He was treated for three days and nights by saint physician Necdemus in a cave like tomb (especially built for Joseph of Arimathea). Thereafter, Jesus recuperated from his wounds, met his trusted disciples on the Mount of Olives, and left Judea towards the sea of Galilee on his way to Damascus. After his dramatic escape from crucifixion, Jesus traveled to the eastern lands in search of the ten lost tribes of Israel. Finally, he died a natural death in Kashmir, India, as opposed to having been raised up alive to Heaven. =Ascetic literature= Jesus is widely venerated in Muslim ascetic and mystic literature, such as in Muslim mystic Al-Ghazali's Ihya \`ulum ad-Din (\\"The revival of the religious sciences\\"). These works lay stress upon Jesus' poverty, his preoccupation with worship, his detachment from worldly life and his miracles. Such depictions also include advice and sermons which are attributed to him. Later Sufic commentaries adapted material from Christian gospels which were consistent with their ascetic portrayal. Sufi philosopher Ibn Arabi described Jesus as \\"the seal of universal holiness\\" due to the quality of his faith and \\"because he holds in his hands the keys of living breath and because he is at present in a state of deprivation and journeying\\". The Gospel of Barnabas, which is generally agreed to correspond with the one found in the two known manuscripts and is reported to be contained in Morisco manuscript BNM MS 9653 in Madrid, claims that Jesus predicted the advent of Muhammad. This was written about 1634 by Ibrahim al-Taybili in Tunisia. While describing how the Bible predicts Muhammad, he speaks of the \\"Gospel of Saint Barnabas where one can find the light\\" (\\"y as√≠ mismo en Evangelio de San Bernab√©, donde se hallar√° la luz\\"). The first published account of the Gospel was in 1717, when a brief reference to the Spanish text is found in De religione Mohamedica by Adriaan Reland; and then in 1718, a much more detailed description of the Italian text by the Irish deist John Toland. Appearance Based upon several Hadith narrations of Muhammad, Jesus can be physically described thus (with any differences in Jesus‚Äô physical description being due to Muhammad describing him when seeing him at different occasions, such as during his ascension to Heaven, or when describing Jesus during Jesus' second coming):, , , , , , , , *A well-built man of medium/moderate/average height and stature with a broad chest. *Straight, lank, and long hair that fell between his shoulders.

It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974. The requirement that black holes lose energy into the wider universe, and therefore can \\"evaporate\\", and the radiated spectrum are both a result of analysing black hole thermal equilibrium combined with extreme redshifting effects very close to the event horizon, with some consideration of quantum entanglement effects. A pair of virtual waves/particles arises just beyond the event horizon due to ordinary quantum effects. Very close to the event horizon, these always manifest as a pair of photons. It may happen that one of these photons passes beyond the event horizon, while the other escapes into the wider universe (\\"to infinity\\").\\\\- Hawking Radiation, Scholarpedia. Authored by Prof. Renaud Parentani, Laboratoire de Physique Th√©orique d'Orsay, Univ. Paris-Sud 11, France, and Prof. Philippe Spindel, Universit√© de Mons, Belgium (2011), Scholarpedia, 6(12):6958 A close analysis shows that the exponential redshifting effect of extreme gravity very close to the event horizon almost tears the escaping photon apart, and in addition very slightly amplifies it. The amplification gives rise to a \\"partner wave\\", which carries negative energy and passes through the event horizon, where it remains trapped, reducing the total energy of the black hole. The escaping photon adds an equal amount of positive energy to the wider universe outside the black hole. In this way, no matter or energy ever actually leaves the black hole itself. A conservation law exists for the partner wave, which in theory shows that the emissions comprise an exact black body spectrum, bearing no information about the interior conditions. Hawking radiation reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that do not gain mass through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. For all except the smallest black holes, this would happen extremely slowly. The radiation temperature is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, so micro black holes are predicted to be larger emitters of radiation than more massive black holes and should thus shrink and dissipate faster. In June 2008, NASA launched the Fermi space telescope, which is searching for the terminal gamma-ray flashes expected from evaporating primordial black holes. In the event that speculative large extra dimension theories are correct, CERN's Large Hadron Collider may be able to create micro black holes and observe their evaporation. No such micro black hole has been observed at CERN. In September 2010, a signal that is closely related to black hole Hawking radiation (see Analog models of gravity) was claimed to have been observed in a laboratory experiment involving optical light pulses. However, the results remain unverified and debatable. Other projects have been launched to look for this radiation within the framework of analog models of gravity.  Overview  Black holes are astrophysical objects of interest due to their immense gravitational attraction. A black hole occurs when more than a certain amount of matter and/or energy is located within a small enough space. Given a large enough mass in a small enough space, the gravitational forces become large enough that within a nearby region of space, nothing - not even light - can escape from inside that region to the wider universe. The boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it cannot observe, become aware of, or be affected by events within the event horizon. This region is the black hole's boundary, in effect. It is unknown what exactly happens to the mass inside a black hole. It is possible that a gravitational singularity forms at the center - a point of zero size and infinite density - or perhaps quantum effects prevent that happening. However, in either case, the event horizon is at some distance from any such point, so the force of gravity is a little weaker at the event horizon (although still exceedingly strong). That means that regardless of the interior conditions, our current understandings of physics can be used to predict what may happen in the region of the event horizon. In 1974, British physicist Stephen Hawking used quantum field theory in curved spacetime to show that in theory, the force of gravity at the event horizon was strong enough to cause energy to \\"leak\\" into the wider universe within a tiny distance of the event horizon. In effect this energy acted as if the black hole itself was slowly evaporating (although it actually came from outside it). Hawking's insight was based on a phenomenon of quantum physics known as virtual particles, and their behaviour near the event horizon. Even in empty space, subatomic \\"virtual\\" particles and antiparticles come briefly into existence, then mutually annihilate and vanish again. Close to a black hole, this manifests as pairs of photons. One of these photons might be pulled beyond the event horizon, leaving the other to escape into the wider universe. Careful analysis showed that if this happened, quantum effects would cause a \\"partner wave\\" carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole, reducing the black hole's total mass, or energy. In effect to an observer it would appear as if the gravitational force had somehow allowed the black hole's energy to be reduced and the energy of the wider universe to be increased. Hence black holes must gradually lose energy and evaporate over time. Considering the thermal properties of black holes, and conservation laws affecting this process, Hawking calculated that the visible outcome would be a very low level of exact black-body radiation - electromagnetic radiation produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. Physical insight into the process may be gained by imagining that particle‚Äìantiparticle radiation is emitted from just beyond the event horizon. This radiation does not come directly from the black hole itself, but rather is a result of virtual particles being \\"boosted\\" by the black hole's gravitation into becoming real particles. As the particle‚Äìantiparticle pair was produced by the black hole's gravitational energy, the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole. An alternative view of the process is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particle‚Äìantiparticle pair to appear close to the event horizon of a black hole. One of the pair falls into the black hole while the other escapes. In order to preserve total energy, the particle that fell into the black hole must have had a negative energy (with respect to an observer far away from the black hole). This causes the black hole to lose mass, and, to an outside observer, it would appear that the black hole has just emitted a particle. In another model, the process is a quantum tunnelling effect, whereby particle‚Äìantiparticle pairs will form from the vacuum, and one will tunnel outside the event horizon. An important difference between the black hole radiation as computed by Hawking and thermal radiation emitted from a black body is that the latter is statistical in nature, and only its average satisfies what is known as Planck's law of black-body radiation, while the former fits the data better. Thus thermal radiation contains information about the body that emitted it, while Hawking radiation seems to contain no such information, and depends only on the mass, angular momentum, and charge of the black hole (the no-hair theorem). This leads to the black hole information paradox. However, according to the conjectured gauge-gravity duality (also known as the AdS/CFT correspondence), black holes in certain cases (and perhaps in general) are equivalent to solutions of quantum field theory at a non-zero temperature. This means that no information loss is expected in black holes (since the theory permits no such loss) and the radiation emitted by a black hole is probably the usual thermal radiation. If this is correct, then Hawking's original calculation should be corrected, though it is not known how (see below). A black hole of one solar mass () has a temperature of only 60 nanokelvins (60 billionths of a kelvin); in fact, such a black hole would absorb far more cosmic microwave background radiation than it emits. A black hole of (about the mass of the Moon, or about across) would be in equilibrium at 2.7 K, absorbing as much radiation as it emits.  Discovery  Hawking's discovery followed a visit to Moscow in 1973 where the Soviet scientists Yakov Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky convinced him that rotating black holes ought to create and emit particles. When Hawking did the calculation, he found to his surprise that even non-rotating black holes produce radiation.. In parallel, in 1972, Jacob Bekenstein conjectured that the black holes should have an entropy , where by the same year, he proposed no hair theorems. Bekenstein's discovery and results are commended by Stephen Hawking which also led him to think about radiation due to this formalism.  Trans-Planckian problem  The trans-Planckian problem is the issue that Hawking's original calculation includes quantum particles where the wavelength becomes shorter than the Planck length near the black hole's horizon. This is due to the peculiar behavior there, where time stops as measured from far away. A particle emitted from a black hole with a finite frequency, if traced back to the horizon, must have had an infinite frequency, and therefore a trans-Planckian wavelength. The Unruh effect and the Hawking effect both talk about field modes in the superficially stationary spacetime that change frequency relative to other coordinates that are regular across the horizon. This is necessarily so, since to stay outside a horizon requires acceleration that constantly Doppler shifts the modes. An outgoing photon of Hawking radiation, if the mode is traced back in time, has a frequency that diverges from that which it has at great distance, as it gets closer to the horizon, which requires the wavelength of the photon to \\"scrunch up\\" infinitely at the horizon of the black hole. In a maximally extended external Schwarzschild solution, that photon's frequency stays regular only if the mode is extended back into the past region where no observer can go. That region seems to be unobservable and is physically suspect, so Hawking used a black hole solution without a past region that forms at a finite time in the past. In that case, the source of all the outgoing photons can be identified: a microscopic point right at the moment that the black hole first formed. The quantum fluctuations at that tiny point, in Hawking's original calculation, contain all the outgoing radiation. The modes that eventually contain the outgoing radiation at long times are redshifted by such a huge amount by their long sojourn next to the event horizon, that they start off as modes with a wavelength much shorter than the Planck length. Since the laws of physics at such short distances are unknown, some find Hawking's original calculation unconvincing. The trans-Planckian problem is nowadays mostly considered a mathematical artifact of horizon calculations. The same effect occurs for regular matter falling onto a white hole solution. Matter that falls on the white hole accumulates on it, but has no future region into which it can go. Tracing the future of this matter, it is compressed onto the final singular endpoint of the white hole evolution, into a trans-Planckian region. The reason for these types of divergences is that modes that end at the horizon from the point of view of outside coordinates are singular in frequency there. The only way to determine what happens classically is to extend in some other coordinates that cross the horizon. There exist alternative physical pictures that give the Hawking radiation in which the trans-Planckian problem is addressed. The key point is that similar trans-Planckian problems occur when the modes occupied with Unruh radiation are traced back in time.For an alternative derivation and more detailed discussion of Hawking radiation as a form of Unruh radiation see In the Unruh effect, the magnitude of the temperature can be calculated from ordinary Minkowski field theory, and is not controversial. Emission process Hawking radiation is required by the Unruh effect and the equivalence principle applied to black hole horizons. Close to the event horizon of a black hole, a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in. An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath of particles that pop out of the local acceleration horizon, turn around, and free-fall back in. The condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity, which implies that some of these particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing Hawking radiation. A Schwarzschild black hole has a metric: :\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}s\\\\right)^2 = -\\\\left(1-\\\\tfrac{2M}{r}\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right)} \\\\,\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}r\\\\right)^2 + r^2 \\\\,\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\Omega\\\\right)^2\\\\, . The black hole is the background spacetime for a quantum field theory. The field theory is defined by a local path integral, so if the boundary conditions at the horizon are determined, the state of the field outside will be specified. To find the appropriate boundary conditions, consider a stationary observer just outside the horizon at position :r = 2M + \\\\frac{\\\\rho^2}{8M}\\\\,. The local metric to lowest order is :\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}s\\\\right)^2 \\\\;=\\\\; - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{4M}\\\\right)^2 \\\\,\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}X_\\\\perp\\\\right)^2 \\\\;=\\\\; - \\\\rho^2 \\\\,\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\mathrm{d}X_\\\\perp\\\\right)^2, which is Rindler in terms of . The metric describes a frame that is accelerating to keep from falling into the black hole. The local acceleration, , diverges as . The horizon is not a special boundary, and objects can fall in. So the local observer should feel accelerated in ordinary Minkowski space by the principle of equivalence. The near-horizon observer must see the field excited at a local temperature :T \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2\\\\pi} \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi\\\\rho} \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2Mr\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right)\\\\,}\\\\,}\\\\,; which is the Unruh effect. The gravitational redshift is given by the square root of the time component of the metric. So for the field theory state to consistently extend, there must be a thermal background everywhere with the local temperature redshift-matched to the near horizon temperature: :T\\\\left(r'\\\\right) \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{\\\\,4\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2Mr\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{2M}{r}\\\\right)\\\\,}\\\\,} \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{1 - \\\\frac{2M}{r}}{\\\\,1 - \\\\frac{2M}{r'}\\\\,} \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2Mr\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{2M}{r'}\\\\right)}}\\\\,. The inverse temperature redshifted to at infinity is :T(\\\\infty) = \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{2 M r}} and is the near-horizon position, near , so this is really: :T(\\\\infty) = \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi M} . So a field theory defined on a black hole background is in a thermal state whose temperature at infinity is: :T_\\\\text{H} = \\\\frac{1}{8 \\\\pi M} . This can be expressed in a cleaner way in terms of the surface gravity of the black hole; this is the parameter that determines the acceleration of a near-horizon observer. In Planck units (), the temperature is :T_\\\\text{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{\\\\,2 \\\\pi\\\\,}\\\\,, where is the surface gravity of the horizon. So a black hole can only be in equilibrium with a gas of radiation at a finite temperature. Since radiation incident on the black hole is absorbed, the black hole must emit an equal amount to maintain detailed balance. The black hole acts as a perfect blackbody radiating at this temperature. In SI units, the radiation from a Schwarzschild black hole is blackbody radiation with temperature :T = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\,c^3}{8\\\\pi G k_\\\\text{B} M} \\\\;\\\\approx\\\\; 1.2 \\\\times 10^{23} \\\\text{K}\\\\, \\\\times \\\\frac{1\\\\,\\\\text{kg}}{M} \\\\;=\\\\; 6 \\\\times 10^{-8}\\\\text{K}\\\\, \\\\times \\\\frac{M_\\\\odot}{M} \\\\,, where is the reduced Planck constant, is the speed of light, is the Boltzmann constant, is the gravitational constant, is the solar mass, and is the mass of the black hole. From the black hole temperature, it is straightforward to calculate the black hole entropy. The change in entropy when a quantity of heat is added is: :\\\\mathrm{d}S \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}Q}{T} \\\\;=\\\\; 8 \\\\pi M\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}Q\\\\,. The heat energy that enters serves to increase the total mass, so: :\\\\mathrm{d}S \\\\;=\\\\; 8 \\\\pi M\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}M \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\left(4 \\\\pi M^2\\\\right)\\\\, . The radius of a black hole is twice its mass in natural units, so the entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area: :S = \\\\pi R^2 = \\\\frac{A}{4} . Assuming that a small black hole has zero entropy, the integration constant is zero. Forming a black hole is the most efficient way to compress mass into a region, and this entropy is also a bound on the information content of any sphere in space time. The form of the result strongly suggests that the physical description of a gravitating theory can be somehow encoded onto a bounding surface. Black hole evaporation When particles escape, the black hole loses a small amount of its energy and therefore some of its mass (mass and energy are related by Einstein's equation ). Consequently, an evaporating black hole will have a finite lifespan. By dimensional analysis, the life span of a black hole can be shown to scale as the cube of its initial mass, and Hawking estimated that any black hole formed in the early universe with a mass of less than approximately 1015 g would have evaporated completely by the present day. In 1976, Don Page refined this estimate by calculating the power produced, and the time to evaporation, for a nonrotating, non-charged Schwarzschild black hole of mass . The time for the event horizon or entropy of a black hole to halve is know as the Page time. The calculations are complicated by the fact that a black hole, being of finite size, is not a perfect black body; the absorption cross section goes down in a complicated, spin-dependent manner as frequency decreases, especially when the wavelength becomes comparable to the size of the event horizon. Page concluded that primordial black holes could only survive to the present day if their initial mass were roughly or larger. Writing in 1976, Page using the understanding of neutrinos at the time erroneously worked on the assumption that neutrinos have no mass and that only two neutrino flavors exist, and therefore his results of black hole lifetimes do not match the modern results which take into account 3 flavors of neutrinos with nonzero masses. A 2008 calculation using the particle content of the Standard Model and the WMAP figure for the age of the universe yielded a mass bound of . If black holes evaporate under Hawking radiation, a solar mass black hole will evaporate over 1064 years which is vastly longer than the age of the universe.See page 596: table 1 and the \\"black hole decay\\" section and previous sentence on that page in A supermassive black hole with a mass of 1011 (100 billion) will evaporate in around . See in particular equation (27). Some monster black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow up to perhaps 1014 during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies. Even these would evaporate over a timescale of up to 10106 years. The power emitted by a black hole in the form of Hawking radiation can easily be estimated for the simplest case of a nonrotating, non-charged Schwarzschild black hole of mass . Combining the formulas for the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole, the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann law of blackbody radiation, the above formula for the temperature of the radiation, and the formula for the surface area of a sphere (the black hole's event horizon), several equations can be derived. The Hawking radiation temperature is:Hawking Radiation Calculator :T_\\\\mathrm{H} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar c^3}{8 \\\\pi G M k_\\\\mathrm{B}} The Bekenstein‚ÄìHawking luminosity of a black hole, under the assumption of pure photon emission (i.e. that no other particles are emitted) and under the assumption that the horizon is the radiating surface is: :P = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar c^6}{15360 \\\\pi G^2 M^2} where is the luminosity, i.e., the radiated power, is the reduced Planck constant, is the speed of light, is the gravitational constant and is the mass of the black hole. It is worth mentioning that the above formula has not yet been derived in the framework of semiclassical gravity. The time that the black hole takes to dissipate is: :t_\\\\mathrm{ev} = \\\\frac{5120 \\\\pi G^2 M^3}{\\\\hbar c^4} = \\\\frac{480 c^2 V}{\\\\hbar G} \\\\approx 2.1\\\\times10^{67}\\\\,\\\\text{years} \\\\ \\\\left(\\\\frac{M}{M_\\\\odot}\\\\right)^3, where and are the mass and (Schwarzschild) volume of the black hole. A black hole of one solar mass ( = ) takes more than to evaporate‚Äîmuch longer than the current age of the universe at . But for a black hole of , the evaporation time is . This is why some astronomers are searching for signs of exploding primordial black holes. However, since the universe contains the cosmic microwave background radiation, in order for the black hole to dissipate, the black hole must have a temperature greater than that of the present-day blackbody radiation of the universe of 2.7 K. This implies that must be less than 0.8% of the mass of the Earth ‚Äì approximately the mass of the Moon. Black hole evaporation has several significant consequences: * Black hole evaporation produces a more consistent view of black hole thermodynamics by showing how black holes interact thermally with the rest of the universe. * Unlike most objects, a black hole's temperature increases as it radiates away mass. The rate of temperature increase is exponential, with the most likely endpoint being the dissolution of the black hole in a violent burst of gamma rays. A complete description of this dissolution requires a model of quantum gravity, however, as it occurs when the black hole's mass approaches 1 Planck mass, when its radius will also approach two Planck lengths. * The simplest models of black hole evaporation lead to the black hole information paradox. The information content of a black hole appears to be lost when it dissipates, as under these models the Hawking radiation is random (it has no relation to the original information). A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed, including suggestions that Hawking radiation is perturbed to contain the missing information, that the Hawking evaporation leaves some form of remnant particle containing the missing information, and that information is allowed to be lost under these conditions. Large extra dimensions The formulae from the previous section are applicable only if the laws of gravity are approximately valid all the way down to the Planck scale. In particular, for black holes with masses below the Planck mass (~), they result in impossible lifetimes below the Planck time (~). This is normally seen as an indication that the Planck mass is the lower limit on the mass of a black hole. In a model with large extra dimensions (10 or 11), the values of Planck constants can be radically different, and the formulae for Hawking radiation have to be modified as well. In particular, the lifetime of a micro black hole with a radius below the scale of the extra dimensions is given by equation 9 in Cheung (2002) and equations 25 and 26 in Carr (2005). :\\\\tau \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{M_*} \\\\left( \\\\frac{M_\\\\mathrm{BH}}{M_*} \\\\right) ^\\\\frac{n+3}{n+1}\\\\,, where is the low energy scale, which could be as low as a few TeV, and is the number of large extra dimensions. This formula is now consistent with black holes as light as a few TeV, with lifetimes on the order of the \\"new Planck time\\" ~. In loop quantum gravity A detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole event horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity. Loop- quantization reproduces the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by Bekenstein and Hawking. Further, it led to the computation of quantum gravity corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes. Based on the fluctuations of the horizon area, a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the Hawking spectrum that would be observable were X-rays from Hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed. The quantum effects are centered at a set of discrete and unblended frequencies highly pronounced on top of Hawking radiation spectrum. Experimental observation Under experimentally achievable conditions for gravitational systems this effect is too small to be observed directly. However, in September 2010 an experimental set-up created a laboratory \\"white hole event horizon\\" that the experimenters claimed was shown to radiate an optical analog to Hawking radiation, although its status as a genuine confirmation remains in doubt. Some scientists predict that Hawking radiation could be studied by analogy using sonic black holes, in which sound perturbations are analogous to light in a gravitational black hole and the flow of an approximately perfect fluid is analogous to gravity.

Fought on August 21, 1981, at the Caesars Palace hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, it pitted Wilfredo G√≥mez, a Puerto Rican who had a record of 32 wins, 0 losses, 1 draw, and all his wins by knockout, and who was the world's Jr. Featherweight champion, against the lesser known Salvador S√°nchez, who hailed from Mexico with a record of 40 wins, 1 loss, 1 draw. Salvador Sanchez was defending his WBC world Featherweight crown. G√≥mez was the strong favorite at the betting windows due to his knockout win streak of 32 fights in a row and S√°nchez's relative obscurity. During the build-up to the fight, Gomez talked often of his intention to score an early knockout over Sanchez and the betting public seemed to be in agreement. The fight was broadcast on closed- circuit television to all of the United States and through many Latin American countries. S√°nchez began by surprising most fans and dropping G√≥mez 40 seconds into round one. G√≥mez got up but was battered around the ring by Sanchez for the remainder of the round, nearly going down again from an overhand right in Wilfredo's own corner. Gomez began to recover in round three and had his moments over the next three rounds, continually going forward and throwing combinations in an effort to turn the fight. However, G√≥mez's right eye started to swell by the third round and was nearly closed by the seventh. S√°nchez started zeroing into that area and landed a number of hard punches that repeatedly rocked Gomez. In the seventh round, Gomez finally landed the combination he wanted, a right-left to the chin that partially lifted Sanchez off his feet; however, he was able to shake off the effects and move away from the corner without further trouble. Round eight proved to be the final round. With G√≥mez almost blinded by his swollen eyes and the Mexican partisans shouting \\"Ole!\\" with every volley of punches, S√°nchez landed a straight right hand that had Gomez teetering and badly hurt on the ropes, followed by a series of punches that almost sent G√≥mez off the ring. Although G√≥mez was able to beat the count, referee Carlos Padilla stepped in and stopped the fight, giving S√°nchez an eighth-round technical knockout (TKO) win. In Mexico, a new legend was born. S√°nchez had, in their eyes, avenged the loss that G√≥mez had inflicted to Carlos Zarate some years before. He became recognized by many Mexicans and international fans as Mexico's greatest world champion ever, but that moment of glory was short lived, because almost a year after his fight with G√≥mez, on August 12 of 1982, S√°nchez was killed in a car accident. Soon, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez would replace him in the hearts of many Mexican boxing fans as their greatest fighter ever. In Puerto Rico, it was a moment to mourn for most boxing fans. Many businesses and stores were closed the day after, as G√≥mez was a national hero to most Puerto Ricans, and he was seen by many as invincible. It took, in the eyes of Puerto Rican boxing fans, 18 years to really avenge G√≥mez's defeat against S√°nchez, and that was when F√©lix Trinidad beat Oscar De La Hoya in 1999. G√≥mez went into a depression, but he roared back the next year and posted world title wins against many other boxers from there on until he retired in 1989. Among the fighters he would beat later were Lupe Pintor (who also is Mexican) at the Carnival of Champions, and Juan Laporte. G√≥mez joined the exclusive group of fighters to win titles in three different boxing divisions. It could be said that S√°nchez, in between the moment he beat G√≥mez and the moment he died almost a year later, warmed himself to the hearts of many Puerto Ricans. He granted interviews to many Puerto Rican television news shows, and was known for speaking well about Puerto Rico and its people. When S√°nchez died, news of his death were heard across Latin America, and many people both in Mexico and Puerto Rico were saddened by his passing. His funeral was shown live in Mexico, and in Puerto Rico, a tribute show to him was aired by WAPA-TV five days after his death, featuring his past interviews with that network's sportscasters, his story, and clips of his fights. G√≥mez himself also became a dear person to the people of Mexico after this fight. Although they knew him as the Mexican beater because of the many other fights he won against Mexican boxers, G√≥mez showed no ill feelings towards the people of Mexico by offering S√°nchez flowers after S√°nchez died, and becoming a frequent visitor to the S√°nchez family thereafter. On S√°nchez's small town, there is always a festival to commemorate S√°nchez's memory every year, around the week of August 12. G√≥mez has been named Grand Marischal of that festival three times already, and has been a guest of honor the thirty six times it has been celebrated after S√°nchez's passing. There had always been talks of a rematch between the two before S√°nchez died. What would have happened in a rematch will never be known, but the fact is that both G√≥mez and S√°nchez are now together in a place far different from a boxing ring: They are both in the International Boxing Hall Of Fame.

As the head of Fiat, he controlled 4.4% of Italy's GDP, 3.1% of its industrial workforce and 16.5% of its industrial investment in research. He was the richest man in modern Italian history. Agnelli was regarded as having an impeccable and slightly eccentric fashion sense, which has influenced both Italian and international men's fashion. Agnelli was awarded the decoration Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1967 and the title Knight of Labour (Cavaliere del lavoro) in 1977. Following his death in 2003, control of the firm was gradually passed to his grandson and chosen heir, John Elkann. Early life Agnelli was born in Turin, but maintained strong ties with the village of Villar Perosa, near Turin in the Piedmont region. His father was the prominent Italian industrialist Edoardo Agnelli and his mother was Princess Virginia Bourbon del Monte, daughter of Carlo, 4th Prince of San Faustino, head of a noble family established in Perugia. Agnelli was named after his grandfather Giovanni Agnelli, the founder of the Italian car manufacturer Fiat. His maternal grandmother was American. Gianni ‚Äì as he was known to differentiate from his grandfather, with whom he shared his first name ‚Äì inherited the command of Fiat and the Agnelli family assets in general in 1966, following a period in which Fiat was temporarily \\"ruled\\" by Vittorio Valletta while Gianni was learning how his family's company worked. Agnelli raised Fiat to become the most important company in Italy, and one of the major car-builders of Europe. He also developed the accessory business, with minor companies also operating in military industry. Agnelli and Fiat would come to share a common vision, Agnelli meaning Fiat and, more sensibly, Fiat meaning Agnelli. Giovanni Agnelli Sr. in 1940. Agnelli was educated at Pinerolo Cavalry Academy, and studied law at the University of Turin, although he never practiced law. He joined a tank regiment in June 1940 when Italy entered World War II on the side of the Axis powers. He fought on the Eastern Front, being wounded twice. He also served in a Fiat-built armoured-car division in North Africa, where he was shot in the arm by a German officer during a bar fight over a woman. After Italy surrendered, due to his fluency in English, Agnelli became a liaison officer with the occupying American troops. His grandfather, who had manufactured vehicles for the Axis powers during the war, was forced to retire from Fiat, but named Valletta to be his successor. Gianni's grandfather died, leaving Gianni head of the family but Valletta running the company. Fiat then began producing Italy's first inexpensive mass-produced car. Prior to his marriage on 19 November 1953 to Donna Marella Caracciolo dei principi di Castagneto ‚Äì a half-American, half-Neapolitan noblewoman who made a small but significant name as a fabric designer, and a bigger name as a tastemakerAlmanach de Gotha (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1942), 398‚Äì399. ‚Äì Agnelli was a noted playboy whose mistresses included the socialite Pamela Harriman and even Jackie Kennedy. Though Agnelli continued to be involved with other women during his marriage, including the film star Anita Ekberg and the American fashion designer Jackie Rogers, the Agnellis remained married until his death of prostate cancer in 2003 at the age of 81. For most of his life, he was considered to be a man of exquisite taste. He left his extraordinary paintings to the city of Turin in 2002. His only son, Edoardo Agnelli, was born seven months after the couple's wedding, in New York on 9 June 1954. Gianni gave up trying to groom him to take over Fiat, seeing how the boy was more interested in mysticism than making cars (he studied religion at Princeton University and took part in a world day of prayer in Assisi). Edoardo, who seemed burdened by the mantle of his surname, committed suicide on 15 November 2000 by jumping off a bridge near Turin; Gianni himself joined police at the scene. Edoardo never married, but he had one son (born out of wedlock in 1973) who was not recognized by Gianni Agnelli. The Agnellis had only one daughter, Countess Margherita Agnelli de Pahlen. She is the mother of John Elkann, Lapo Elkann and Ginevra Elkann. She has five other children from her second marriage to Count Serge de Pahlen. Maria de Pahlen, Peter de Pahlen, Anna de Pahlen and Tatiana de Pahlen. Head of Fiat Agnelli became president of Fiat in 1966. He opened factories in many places, including Russia (at the time the Soviet Union) and South America, and started international alliances and joint-ventures (like Iveco), which marked a new industrial mentality. In the 1970s, during the international petrol crisis, he sold part of the company to Lafico, a Libyan company owned by Colonel Qaddhafi; Agnelli would later repurchase these shares, however. Gianni Agnelli (in the center) and the FIAT board of directors meet President Sandro Pertini (at his left) during an official visit to the new Sevel Val di Sangro factory, 1981. His relationships with the Left, especially with Enrico Berlinguer's Communist Party, were the essence of the relationships between labour forces and Italian industry. The social conflicts related to Fiat's policies (some say politics) always saw Agnelli keeping the leading role; in the 1980s, during the last important trade union action, a dramatic situation in which a strike was blocking all of Fiat's production, he was able to organise the march of 40,000 workers who broke the pickets and re-entered the factories. This marked the demise of the power of trade unions, which to this day have not recovered their influence on Italy's politics and economy. In the 1970s, Fiat and its leaders were attacked, mostly by the Red Brigades, Prima Linea and NAP. Several people working for the group were killed, and trade unions were initially suspected of hiding some of the attackers in their organizations, though the same terrorists later targeted trade unionists like Guido Rossa. Agnelli's politics and the events at Fiat in the 1970s were the subject of Dario Fo's 1981 satirical play Trumpets and Raspberries. Agnelli was named senator for life in 1991 and subscribed to the independent parliamentary group; he was later named a member of the senate's defence commission. In the early 2000s, Agnelli made overtures to General Motors resulting in an agreement under which General Motors progressively became involved in Fiat. The recent serious crisis of Fiat found Agnelli already fighting against cancer, and he could take little part in these events. Agnelli was also closely connected with Juventus, the most renowned Italian football club, of which he was a fan and the direct owner. His phone calls, every morning at 6 am, from wherever he was, whatever was he doing, to the club's president Giampiero Boniperti, were legendary. Agnelli encountered a number of difficulties with Mediobanca through Cesare Romiti, who caused Agnelli profound anxiety. Mediobanca made a policy of constantly supervising the Fiat because of their financial interests in the company, often becoming significantly involved in executive decisions and important issues. Vincenzo Maranghi, who later became the CEO of the bank, eventually developed a close friendship with Agnelli, despite previous tensions. From left to right: Gianni Agnelli, investor and former chairman of Juventus, talks with some squad's footballers ‚Äî Cuccureddu, Marchetti, Zoff, Altafini and Anastasi ‚Äî in the summer of 1972. Nicknamed L'Avvocato (\\"The Lawyer\\") because he had a degree in law (though he was never admitted to the Order of Lawyers), Agnelli was the most important figure in Italian economy, the symbol of capitalism throughout the second half of 20th century, and regarded by many as the true \\"King of Italy\\". A cultivated man of keen intelligence and a peculiar sense of humour, he was perhaps the most famous Italian abroad, forming deep relationships with international bankers and politicians, largely through the Bilderberg Group, whose conferences he attended regularly since 1958. Some of the other Bilderberg regulars became close friends, among them Henry Kissinger. Another longtime associate was David Rockefeller (yet another Bilderberg regular), who appointed him to the International Advisory Committee (IAC) of Chase Manhattan Bank, of which Rockefeller was chairman; Agnelli sat on this committee for thirty years. He was also a member of a syndicate with Rockefeller that for a time in the 1980s owned Rockefeller Center.Association with David Rockefeller ‚Äì see his Memoirs, New York: Random House, 2002 (pp. 208, 479, 481) Later life and death Agnelli stepped down in 1996, but stayed on as honorary chairman until his death. Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, the son of Gianni's younger brother, Umberto Agnelli, died of a rare form of cancer in 1997 at age 33 while he was being groomed by his uncle to head the Fiat Group. John Elkann, the son of Gianni and Marella's daughter, Margherita, was expected to take over Fiat after Gianni's death. However, Umberto became chairman, taking over from Paolo Fresco. Fresco had diversified the Group's holdings, but Umberto refocused its activities on its auto and mechanics division. He then brought in Giuseppe Morchio to mastermind a rescue strategy for the company. Morchio was expected to continue to run the Fiat Group as it attempted to claw its way out of its latest financial crisis. However, upon Umberto's death, Ferrari chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo was named chairman, with Elkann as vice chairman; Morchio immediately offered his resignation. His successor Sergio Marchionne was an expert of reorganisation who between 2002 and 2004 led the Swiss certification company Societ√© G√©n√©rale de Surveillance (SGS). Gianni Agnelli died in 2003 of prostate cancer at age 81 in Turin. Fiat-owned Scuderia Ferrari named their 2003 F1 contender the F2003-GA, in tribute to Agnelli. Style Agnelli's fashion sense and style inspired and influenced menswear throughout the years in Italy and around the world. In his retirement speech, Milanese fashion designer Nino Cerruti named Agnelli as one of his biggest inspirations along with James Bond and John F. Kennedy. Esquire magazine named Agnelli as one of five best dressed men in the history of the World. Agnelli's dress style featured a foundation of classic suits. He had a large number of bespoke Caraceni suits, which were of high quality and classic design. He was known for wearing his wristwatch over his cuff and was regarded as conveying sprezzatura, the Italian art of making the difficult look easy.

It is a commune and sub-prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais department west-northwest of Lille on the railway to Calais. The town is named after Saint Audomar, who brought Christianity to the area.http://www.ecatholic2000.com/butler/vol9/september39.shtml The canalised portion of the river Aa begins at Saint-Omer, reaching the North Sea at Gravelines in northern France. Below its walls, the Aa connects with the Neufoss√© Canal, which ends at the River Lys. History Saint-Omer first appeared in the writings during the 7th century under the name of Sithiu (Sithieu or Sitdiu), around the Saint-Bertin abbey founded on the initiative of Audomar, Odemaars or Omer). Omer, bishop of Th√©rouanne, in the 7th century established the Abbey of Saint Bertin, from which that of Notre-Dame was an offshoot.http://www.informationfrance.com/st-omer.php Rivalry and dissension, which lasted till the French Revolution, soon sprang up between the two monasteries, becoming especially virulent when in 1559 St Omer became a bishopric and Notre-Dame was raised to the rank of cathedral. In the 9th century, the village that grew up round the monasteries took the name of St Omer. The Normans laid the place waste about 860 and 880. Ten years later the town and monastery had built fortified walls and were safe from their attack. Situated on the borders of territories frequently disputed by French, Flemish, English and Spaniards, St Omer for most of its history continued to be subject to sieges and military invasions. In 932 Arnulf of Flanders conquered the County of Artois and Saint-Omer (Sint-Omaars in Dutch) became part of the County of Flanders for the next three centuries. In 1071 Philip I and the teenage Count Arnulf III of Flanders were defeated at St Omer by Arnulf's uncle and former protector, Robert the Frisian, who subsequently became the Count of Flanders until his death in 1093. Along with its textile industry, St-Omer flourished in the 12th and 13th century. In 1127 the town received a communal charter from the count, William Clito, becoming the first town in West Flanders with city rights. Later on the city lost its leading position in the textile industry to Brugge. After the mysterious death of Count Baldwin I, the County of Flanders was weakened. In 1214 Philip II of France captured Baldwin's daughter Joan and her husband Ferdinand, Count of Flanders and forced them to sign the Treaty of Pont-√†-Vendin, in which Artois was yielded to France. Ferdinand did not take this lying down, and allied with Emperor Otto IV and John, King of England, he battled Philip II at Bouvines, but was defeated. Despite the political separation for the next 170 years, the city remained part of the economic network of Flanders. In 1340 a large battle was fought in the town's suburbs between an Anglo-Flemish army and a French one under Eudes IV, Duke of Burgundy, in which the Anglo-Flemish force was forced to withdraw. From 1384, St-Omer was part of the Burgundian Netherlands, from 1482 of the Habsburg Netherlands and from 1581 to 1678 of the Spanish Netherlands. The French made futile attempts against the town between 1551 and 1596. During the Thirty Years' War, the French attacked in 1638 (under Cardinal Richelieu) and again in 1647. Finally in 1677, after a seventeen-day siege, Louis XIV forced the town to capitulate. The peace of Nijmegen signed in the fall of 1678 permanently confirmed the conquest and its annexation by France.https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaties-of-Nijmegen In 1711, St-Omer was besieged by the Duke of Marlborough. On the verge of surrendering because of famine, Jacqueline Robin risked her life to bring provisions into the town, in memory of which in 1884 a large statue of her was erected in front of the cathedral. The College of Saint Omer was established in 1593 by Fr Robert Persons SJ, an English Jesuit, to educate English Catholics.http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=10335 After the Protestant Reformation, England had established penal laws against Catholic education in the country. The college operated in St Omer until 1762, when it migrated to Bruges and then to Li√®ge in 1773. It finally moved to England in 1794, settling at Stonyhurst, Lancashire. Former students of the College of Saint Omer include John Carroll, his brother Daniel and his cousin Charles. During World War I on 8 October 1914, the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) arrived in Saint-Omer and a headquarters was established at the aerodrome next to the local race course. For the following four years, Saint-Omer was a focal point for all RFC operations in the field. Although most squadrons only used Saint-Omer as a transit camp before moving on to other locations, the base grew in importance as it increased its logistic support to the RFC. Many Royal Air Force squadrons can trace their roots to formation at Saint-Omer during this period. Among which are No. IX Squadron RAF which was formed at Saint- Omer, 14 December 1914http://www.raf.mod.uk/organisation/9squadron.cfm and No. 16 Squadron RAF which was formed on 10 February 1915. During World War II, the Luftwaffe used the airfield. When the RAF's legless Battle of Britain ace, Douglas Bader, parachuted from his Spitfire during an aerial battle over France, he was initially treated at a Luftwaffe hospital at Saint-Omer. He had lost an artificial leg when bailing out,http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/airforce/p/World-War-Ii-Group-Captain- Sir-Douglas-Bader.htm and the RAF dropped him another one during a bombing raid. Main sites Cathedral The fortifications (which had been improved by Vauban in the 17th century) were demolished during the last decade of the 19th century, and boulevards and new thoroughfares built in their place. A section of the ramparts remains intact on the western side of the town, converted into a park known as the jardin public (public garden). There are two harbours outside the city and another within its limits. Saint-Omer has wide streets and spacious squares. 19th century Cavaill√©-Coll organ in the cathedral The old cathedral was constructed almost entirely in the 13th, 14th and centuries. A heavy square tower finished in 1499 surmounts the west portal. The church contains Biblical paintings, a colossal statue of Christ seated between the Virgin Mary and St John (13th century, originally belonging to the cathedral of Th√©rouanne and presented by the emperor Charles V), the cenotaph of Saint Audomare (Omer) (13th century) and numerous ex-votos. The richly decorated chapel in the transept contains a wooden figure of the Virgin (12th century), the object of pilgrimages. Of St Bertin church, part of the abbey (built between 1326 and 1520 on the site of previous churches) where Childeric III retired to end his days, there remain some arches and a lofty tower, which serve to adorn a public garden. Several other churches or convent chapels are of interest, among them St Sepulchre (14th century), which has a beautiful stone spire and stained-glass windows. The cathedral has a huge Cavaill√©-Coll organ, which is still playable. Main square and town hall Former Saint-Omer College English chapel A collection of records, a picture gallery, and a theatre are all situated in the town hall, built of the materials from the abbey of St Bertin. Several houses date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The H√¥tel Colbert, once the royal lodging, is now occupied by an archaeological museum. The military hospital occupies the former English College, founded by the English Jesuits in 1593. It is now part of the Lyc√©e Alexandre Ribot. Besides the Lyc√©e, there are schools of music and of art. The old episcopal palace adjoining the cathedral is used as a court-house. Saint-Omer is the seat of a court of assizes and tribunals, of a chamber of commerce, and of a board of trade arbitration. Until 1942, the chief statue in the town was that of Jacqueline Robin, who, according to the mythology, had helped the town resist a siege by Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy in in 1711. However, the statue disappeared during the German occupation, taken to be melted down. Today, the remaining statues of people associated with the city: * L‚Äôabb√© Suger * Pierre Alexandre Monsigny * Prince Ferdinand-Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans, duc d‚ÄôOrl√©ans Economy Over the better part of the last century, the economy of Saint Omer had depended largely on 1 enterprise, that of the glass maker Arc International (situated in the neighbouring town of Arques). The economy of Saint Omer has diversified over the course of the past 50 years. Aside from the glass works at Arc International, major employers in the area include: * Alphaglass * Brasserie Saint Omer * Brasserie Goudale * Les Fromageurs de Saint Omer * La Societe es Eaux de Saint Omer * Centre Hospitalier R√©gion de Saint-Omer * Bonduelle The creation of new enterprises has seen a steady growth in the past 10 years with 2 147 enterprises as of 2020 . In the town itself, there are a number of retail shops and services, as well as a large selection of restaurants, brasseries and caf√©s. Historically, the economy of Saint Omer had also developed in the wetlands outside the city, known locally as le marais, which remans one of the last cultivated marais in France. The Marais Audomarois is currently listed as a UNESCO heritage site The agricultural output from this area continues year-round, thanks to the mild climate and fertile soil. Among the specialties, cauliflower is a notable product and is exported throughout Europe. Other crops for which the area is know are carrots, endive, and watercress Nearby areas At the end of the marshes, on the borders of the forest of Clairmarais, are the ruins of the abbey founded in 1140 by Thierry of Alsace. Thomas Becket sought refuge here in 1165. To the south of Saint-Omer, on a hill commanding the Aa, lies the camp of Helfaut, often called the camp of Saint-Omer. On the Canal de Neufoss√©, near the town, is the Ascenseur des Fontinettes, a hydraulic lift which once raised and lowered canal boats to and from the Aa, over a height of 12m. This was replaced in 1967 by a large lock. During the Second World War, the area was chosen as a launch site for the V-2 rocket. The nearby blockhouse at √âperlecques and underground complex of La Coupole were built for this purpose and are open to the public. Culture and arts Saint-Omer is diverse in ethnic, linguistic and immigrant communities. Haut-Pont is a heavily West Flemish section of Saint-Omer which has Flemish/Belgian roots.http://www.france.com/regions/northern-france/ In the Southeast of the cathedral is a newly formed Turkish neighborhood; the majority of the local Turks are members of the Christian faith (i.e. Greek Orthodox or of ethnic Greek origin, Eastern Rite and Catholic converts), who arrived in France after World War I to escape religious persecution. Genealogists have noted the many cultural influences in the area, including British, Dutch, German, Austrian, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak and Polish. It is believed the region's mining and glass manufacturinghttp://www.tourisme-saintomer.com/en/annuaire/arques-its- history/ industries contributed to a revived post-war (WWI and WWII era) population. =Public library= The public library of Saint-Omer holds, in its rare books section,Document sans titre www.bibliotheque-st-omer.fr one of the three French copies of the 42-line Gutenberg Bible, originally from the library of the Abbey of Saint Bertin. The other two copies are in Paris. In November 2014, a previously unknown Shakespeare First Folio was found in a public library in Saint-Omer. The book had lain undisturbed in the library for 200 years. The first 30 pages were missing. A number of experts assisted in authenticating the folio, which also had a name, \\"Neville\\", written on the first surviving page, indicating that it may have once been owned by Edward Scarisbrick. Scarisbrick had fled England due to anti-Catholic repression and attended Saint-Omer College, a Jesuit institution. Confirmation of its authenticity came from a professor at the University of Nevada and one of the world's foremost authorities on Shakespeare, Eric Rasmussen, who happened to be in London at the time.Shakespeare Folio found in French library, 26 November 2014 (with video and images) The only other known copy of a First Folio in France is in the National Library in Paris.

It is primarily an undergraduate, liberal arts institution accompanied by the John M. and Mary Jo Boler College of Business. John Carroll has an enrollment of 3,650 students. The university offers undergraduate programs in the liberal arts, sciences, and business, and in selected areas at the master's level. John Carroll offers 70 academic programs of study for undergraduate students. History Saint Ignatius High School campus =Founding= John Carroll University was founded in 1886 by the Society of Jesuits under the title of St Ignatius College as a \\"college for men\\". It has been in continuous operation as a degree-granting institution since that time. Founded as the 19th of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, it is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. It was founded 97 years after Georgetown University, the first Catholic Jesuit University in the United States. In 1923 the college was renamed John Carroll University, honoring the first archbishop of the US Catholic Church, who founded Georgetown University. In 1935, it was moved from its original location on the west side of Cleveland to its present site in University Heights, a suburb east of downtown Cleveland. However, the high school section retained the original name and continues to operate on the original site in Cleveland. The city of University Heights had been renamed from \\"Idlewood\\" during the construction of the campus. John Carroll University administration building tower During World War II, John Carroll was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. =Expansion= In September 1968, the university made the transition from full-time male enrollment to a fully coeducational institution, admitting women to the College of Arts and Sciences for the first time. In recent years, the university has undergone extensive reconstruction and expansion. In 2003, the university opened the $66 million, 265,000 ft¬≤ (25,000 m¬≤) Dolan Center for Science and Technology, named after alumnus Charles Dolan, founder of Cablevision and HBO, and his wife Helen Dolan. The couple met while attending John Carroll. In 2011, the university completed the removal of the Bohannon Science building and celebrated the Hamlin Quad enhancement project. =Jesuit tradition= The Jesuits who founded St. Ignatius College were exiles from Germany, forced out by Bismarck's Kulturkampf. They brought with them the traditional structure of the Jesuit college as an extension of the apostolate of the religious community to prepare the student morally as well as intellectually. The principal instrument of this education was the classical course of seven years, in which the first three years were devoted to learning languages as necessary tools. The student was then considered prepared for university work. The next four years were devoted to the study of classical literature and Latin and Greek prose and poetry, and to developing the ability to express one's self in these languages, as well as in the vernacular, orally and in writing. The final year was devoted to philosophy. There were also electives in the sciences, history, and geography, as well as other subjects. If the student completed only six years, a certificate was given. Completion of the year of philosophy made the student eligible for the baccalaureate degree, which the college was empowered to grant when it was chartered in 1890. The first two degrees were awarded in 1895. John Carroll's core value and mission emphasizes social justice and service to the community and the broader world. The university also follows Jesuit traditions by focusing on educating the ‚Äúwhole‚Äù student, or the intellectual, spiritual, emotional, and physical development of each student. Although its curriculum and community are shaped by its Jesuit and Catholic nature, it welcomes faculty, staff, and students of all faiths and of no faith. The university announced in December, 2017 that its board of directors had named the school's first non-Jesuit president, Michael D. Johnson, PhD. Johnson had been the provost at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He began his tenure on July 1, 2018 and was officially inaugurated on September 6, 2018. Academics John Carroll University is organized into two schools: the College of Arts and Sciences and the AACSB-accredited Boler College of Business, each defining its own academic programs under the auspices of the Academic Vice President. All students need to fulfill the requirements in the core curriculum, as well as those required by their major field of study. =Core curriculum= The university requires a liberal arts core for all undergraduate students.

In addition, three teams have qualified for the national semifinals in team sporting events: the 2002 football team, the 2003‚Äì04 men's basketball team, and the 2016 football team. On November 12, 2016, John Carroll defeated the University of Mount Union 31-28, snapping the program's college football record of 112 straight regular season wins. There have been 22 individual national champions: 16 in wrestling, two in men's outdoor track & field, one in men's indoor track & field, one in women's outdoor track & field, one in women's diving, and one in men's swimming. The Men's and Women's Swimming and Diving team has won back to back OAC championship titles (2017, 2018), the men's tennis team has won four straight OAC titles (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), the women's tennis team won three straight OAC titles in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and the men's lacrosse team has won three consecutive titles in the regular season and tournament (2016, 2017, 2018). The JCU men's basketball team won the OAC regular season and tournament titles in 2018. Since joining the OAC in 1989‚Äì90, John Carroll has won twice as many regular season titles (11) in men's basketball than any other school (5) over that span of time. In club sports, the 2017‚Äì18 club rugby team qualified for the national championship.

Pyle is also notable for the columns he wrote as a roving human-interest reporter from 1935 through 1941 for the Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate that earned him wide acclaim for his simple accounts of ordinary people across North America. When the United States entered World War II, he lent the same distinctive, folksy style of his human-interest stories to his wartime reports from the European theater (1942‚Äì44) and Pacific theater (1945). Pyle won the Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for his newspaper accounts of \\"dogface\\" infantry soldiers from a first- person perspective. He was killed by enemy fire on Iejima (then known as Ie Shima) during the Battle of Okinawa. At the time of his death in 1945, Pyle was among the best-known American war correspondents. His syndicated column was published in 400 daily and 300 weekly newspapers nationwide. President Harry Truman said of Pyle, \\"No man in this war has so well told the story of the American fighting man as American fighting men wanted it told. He deserves the gratitude of all his countrymen.\\" Early life and education Ernie Pyle birthplace in Dana, Indiana Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Taylor Pyle was born on August 3, 1900, on the Sam Elder farm near Dana, Indiana, in rural Vermillion County, Indiana. His parents were Maria (Taylor) and William Clyde Pyle. At the time of Pyle's birth his father was a tenant farmer on the Elder property. Neither of Pyle's parents attended school beyond the eighth grade. Pyle, an only child, disliked farming and pursued a more adventurous life. After graduating from a local high school in Bono, Helt Township, Vermillion County, Indiana, he enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War I. Pyle began his training at the University of Illinois at Champaign‚ÄìUrbana, but the war ended before he could be transferred to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station for additional training.He served three months of active duty until the war ended, then finished his enlistment in the reserves and was discharged with the rank of Petty Officer Third Class. Pyle enrolled at Indiana University in 1919,Miller (1946), p. 13. aspiring to become a journalist. However, IU did not offer a degree in journalism at that time, so Pyle majored in economics and took as many journalism courses as he could. Pyle began studying journalism in his sophomore year, the same year he joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and began working on the Indiana Daily Student, the student-written newspaper. During his junior year Pyle became the newspaper's city editor and its news editor; he also worked on the Arbutus, the campus yearbook, although he did not enjoy the desk-bound work. Pyle's simple, storytelling writing style, which he developed while a student at IU, later became his trademark style as a professional journalist and earned him millions of readers as a columnist for Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate.Albright, pp. 6 and 8. In March 1922, during his junior year at IU, Pyle and three of his fraternity brothers dropped out of school for a semester to follow the IU baseball team on a trip to Japan. Pyle and his fraternity brothers found work aboard the S.S. Keystone State. During its voyage across the Pacific Ocean, the ship docked at ports such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, as well as in Japan before returning trip to the United States. Pyle's interest in traveling and exploring the world would continue in his later years as a reporter.Miller (1946), pp. 13‚Äì14.Albright, pp. 8 and 11. After his trip across the Pacific, Pyle returned to IU Bloomington, where he was named editor-in-chief of the Indiana Summer Student, the summer edition of the campus newspaper. During his senior year at IU, Pyle continued his work at the Daily Student and the Arbutus. He also joined Sigma Delta Chi, the journalism fraternity, and was active in other campus clubs. In addition, Pyle was selected as a senior manager of IU's football team, making him a letterman along with the other members of the team in 1922.Albright, p. 10. Pyle left school in January 1923 with only a semester remaining and without graduating from IU.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 25.Miller (1946), p. 15. He took a job as a newspaper reporter for the Daily Herald in La Porte, Indiana, earning $25 a week.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 27. Pyle worked at the Daily Herald for three months before moving to Washington, D.C., to join the staff of The Washington Daily News. Personal life Pyle met his future wife, Geraldine Elizabeth \\"Jerry\\" Siebolds (August 23, 1899 ‚Äì November 23, 1945), a native of Minnesota, at a Halloween party in Washington, D.C., in 1923. They married in July 1925.Brockman, pp. 46‚Äì47.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 30. See also: In the early years of their marriage the couple traveled the country together. In Pyle's newspaper columns describing their trips, he often referred to her as \\"That Girl who rides with me.\\"Albright, p. 11. In June 1940, Pyle purchased property about from downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, and had a modest, home built on the site. The residence served as the couple's home base in the United States for the remainder of their lives.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 51. Ernie and Jerry Pyle had a tempestuous relationship. He often complained of being ill, was a \\"heavy abuser of alcohol at times,\\" and suffered from bouts of depression, later made worse from the stress of his work as a war correspondent during World War II. His wife suffered from alcoholism and periods of mental illness (depression or bipolar disorder).Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 50.Miller (1950), pp. and 169‚Äì73. See also: She also made several suicide attempts.During one of Pyle's return visits to the United States during World War II, he wrote to his college roommate, Paige Cavanaugh: \\"Geraldine was drunk the afternoon I got home. From there she went on down. Went completely screwball. One night she tried the gas. Had to have a doctor.\\" See: Miller (1950), pp. 164. Pyle later described her as his \\"fearful and troubled wife ... desperate within herself since the day she was born.\\" Although the couple divorced on April 14, 1942, they remarried by proxy in March 1943, while Pyle was covering the war in North Africa.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 62.Miller (1950), pp. 63‚Äì64. They had no children. Newspapers reported that Jerry Pyle \\"took the news [of her husband's death] bravely\\", but her health declined rapidly in the months following his death on April 18, 1945, while he was covering operations of American troops on Ie Shima. Jerry Pyle died from complications of influenza at Albuquerque, New Mexico, on November 23, 1945. See also: Career =Staff reporter and aviation columnist= In 1923, Pyle moved to Washington, D.C., to join the staff as a reporter for the Washington Daily News, a new Scripps-Howard tabloid newspaper, and soon became a copy editor as well. Pyle was paid $30 a week for his services, beginning a career with Scripps-Howard that would continue for the remainder of his life. When Pyle joined the Daily News all the editors were young, including editor-in-chief John M. Gleissner, Lee G. Miller (who became a lifelong friend of Pyle)Miller later became Pyle's biographer and the author of An Ernie Pyle Album ‚Äì Indiana to Ie Shima (1946). See Charles M. Egan, Willis \\"June\\" Thornton Jr., and Paul McCrea.Miller (1946), pp. 16‚Äì17. By 1926, Pyle and his wife, Geraldine \\"Jerry\\", had quit their jobs. In ten weeks the couple traveled more than 9,000 miles across the United States in a Ford Model T roadster.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 31. After briefly working in New York City for the Evening World and the New York Post, Pyle returned to the Daily News in December 1927 to begin work on one of the country's first and its best-known aviation column, which he wrote for four years. Pyle's column appeared in syndication for the Scripps-Howard newspapers from 1928 to 1932. Although he never became an aircraft pilot, Pyle flew about as a passenger.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, pp. 32, 34.Johnson and Hays, p. 47. As Amelia Earhart later said, \\"Any aviator who didn't know Pyle was a nobody.\\" =Human-interest and columnist= In 1932, at the age of thirty-one, Pyle was named managing editor at the Daily News, serving in the position for three years before taking on a new writing assignment.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, pp. 33‚Äì34. In December 1934 Pyle took an extended vacation in the western United States to recuperate from a severe bout of influenza. Upon his return to Washington, D.C., and while he filled in for the paper's vacationing syndicated columnist Heywood Broun, Pyle wrote a series of eleven articles about his trip and the people he had met. The series proved popular with both readers and colleagues. G.B. (\\"Deac\\") Parker, editor-in- chief of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, said he had found in Pyle's vacation articles \\"a sort of Mark Twain quality and they knocked my eyes right out.\\"Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, pp. 38‚Äì39. In 1935, Pyle left his position as managing editor at the Daily News to write his own national column as a roving reporter of human-interest stories for the Scripps-Howard newspaper syndicate. Over the next six years, from 1935 until early 1942, Pyle and his wife, Jerry, whom Pyle identified in his columns as \\"That Girl who rides with me,\\" traveled the United States, Canada, and Mexico, as well as Central and South America, writing about the interesting places he saw and people he met. Pyle's column, published under the title of the \\"Hoosier Vagabond,\\" appeared six days a week in Scripps-Howard newspapers. The articles became popular with readers, earning Pyle national notoriety in the years preceding his even bigger fame as a war correspondent during World War II. Selected columns of Pyle's human interest stories were later compiled in Home Country (1947), published posthumously. Despite his growing popularity, Pyle lacked confidence and was perpetually dissatisfied with his writing; however, he was pleased when others recognized the quality of his work. Pyle's aviation and travel reports laid the groundwork for his life as a war correspondent. Pyle continued his daily travel column until 1942, but by that time he was also writing about American soldiers serving in World War II. =World War II correspondent= Pyle with a crew from the US Army's 191st Tank Battalion at the Anzio beachhead in 1944 Pyle initially went to London in 1940 to cover the Battle of Britain, but returned to Europe in 1942 as a war correspondent for Scripps-Howard newspapers. Beginning in North Africa in late 1942, Pyle spent time with the U.S. military during the North African Campaign, the Italian campaign, and the Normandy landings. He returned to the United States in September 1944, spending several weeks recuperating from combat stress before reluctantly agreeing to travel to the Asiatic-Pacific Theater in January 1945. Pyle was covering the invasion of Okinawa when he was killed in April 1945. European theater Pyle at Anzio, Italy, 1944 Pyle volunteered to go to London in December 1940 to cover the Battle of Britain. He witnessed the German firebombing of the city and reported on the growing conflict in Europe. His recollections of his experiences from this period were published in his book, Ernie Pyle in England (1941).Brockman, p. 47. After returning to the United States in March 1941 and taking a three-month leave of absence from work to care for his wife, Pyle made a second trip to Great Britain in June 1942, when he accepted an assignment to become a war correspondent for Scripps-Howard newspapers. Pyle's wartime columns usually described the war from the common man's perspective as he rotated among the various branches of the U.S. military and reported from the front lines. Pyle joined American troops in North Africa and Europe (1942‚Äì44), and the Asiatic-Pacific Theater (1945).Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, pp. 55‚Äì59 and 63. Collections of Pyle's newspaper columns from the campaigns he covered in the European theater are included in Here is Your War (1943) and Brave Men (1944). In his reports of the North African Campaign in late 1942 and early 1943, Pyle told stories of his early wartime experiences, which made interesting reading for Americans in the United States.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 64. Through his work, Pyle became friends of the enlisted men and officers, as well as those in leadership roles such as Generals Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 280. Pyle wrote that he was especially fond of the infantry \\"because they are the underdogs.\\" Pyle lived among the U.S servicemen and was free to interview anyone he wanted. As a noncombatant Pyle could also leave the front when he wanted. He interrupted his reporting in September 1943 and in September 1944 to return home to recuperate from the stresses of combatJohnson and Hays, pp. 49 and 53.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 65. and care for his wife when she was ill.Tobin, pp. 60‚Äì61, 123‚Äì24, 159‚Äì61, and 219‚Äì220. Reinforcing his status as the dogface G.I.'s best friend, Pyle wrote a column from Italy in 1944 proposing that soldiers in combat should get \\"fight pay,\\" just as airmen received \\"flight pay.\\" In May 1944 the U.S. Congress passed a law that became known as the Ernie Pyle bill. It authorized 50 percent extra pay for combat service. Pyle's most famous column, \\"The Death of Captain Waskow,\\" written in Italy in December 1943, was published on January 10, 1944, when Allied forces were fighting at the Anzio beachhead in Italy. The notable story also marked the peak of Pyle's writing career.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 78. After the North African and Italian campaigns, Pyle left Italy in April 1944, relocating to England to cover preparations for the Allied landing at Normandy. Pyle was among the twenty-eight war correspondents chosen to accompany U.S. troops during the initial invasion in June 1944. He landed with American troops at Omaha Beach aboard a LST.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, pp. 81‚Äì83. On D-Day Pyle wrote: > The best way I can describe this vast armada and the frantic urgency of the > traffic is to suggest that you visualize New York city on its busiest day of > the year and then just enlarge that scene until it takes in all the ocean > the human eye can reach clear around the horizon and over the horizon. There > are dozens of times that many.On preparations to invade at Normandy, see: In July 1944, Pyle was nearly caught in the accidental bombing by the U.S. Army Air Forces at the onset of Operation Cobra near Saint-L√¥ in Normandy .Tobin, pp. 195‚Äì96. A month after witnessing the liberation of Paris in August 1944, Pyle publicly apologized to his readers in a column on September 5, 1944, stating that \\"my spirit is wobbly and my mind is confused\\" and he said that if he \\"heard one more shot or saw one more dead man, I would go off my nut.\\" He later said he had \\"lost track of the point of the war\\" and that another two weeks of coverage would have seen him hospitalized with \\"war neurosis.\\" An exhausted Pyle wrote that he hoped that a rest at his home in New Mexico would restore his vigor to go \\"warhorsing around the Pacific\\".Tobin, p. 201. Pacific theater Pyle shares a cigarette with soldiers on Okinawa Pyle reluctantly headed for the Pacific theater in January 1945 for what became his final writing assignment. While covering the U.S. Navy and Marine forces in the Pacific, Pyle challenged the Navy's policy forbidding the use of the names of sailors in reporting the war. He won a partial but unsatisfying victory when the ban was lifted exclusively for him.Tobin, p. 234. Pyle travelled on board the aircraft carrier . He thought the naval crew had an easier life compared to the infantry in Europe, and wrote several unflattering portraits of the Navy.Tobin, pp. 228, 231, and 233‚Äì34. In response, fellow correspondents, newspaper editorialists and G.I.s criticized Pyle (who was a former member of the U.S. Naval Reserve) for his negative coverage of the Navy in his columns and for underestimating the difficulties of naval warfare in the Pacific. Pyle conceded that his heart was with the servicemen in Europe,Tobin, pp. 234 and 236. but he persevered. After traveling to Guam and resuming his writing, Pyle went on to report on naval action during the Battle of Okinawa, the largest amphibious assault in the Pacific theater during World War II. See also: Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 98. Death Ernie Pyle shortly after being killed on Iejima, April 18, 1945 On more than one occasion, Pyle was noted for having premonitions of his own death. Before landing he wrote letters to his friend Paige Cavanaugh, as well as playwright Robert E. Sherwood, predicting that he might not survive the war.Tobin, p. 238. On April 17, 1945, Pyle came ashore with the U.S. Army's 305th Infantry Regiment, 77th Infantry Division, on Ie Shima (now known as Iejima), a small island northwest of Okinawa that Allied forces had captured, but had not yet cleared of enemy soldiers. The following day, after local enemy opposition had supposedly been neutralized, Pyle was traveling by jeep with Lieutenant Colonel Joseph B. Coolidge, the commanding officer of the 305th and three additional officers toward Coolidge's new command post when the vehicle came under fire from a Japanese machine gun.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, pp. 106‚Äì07. The men immediately took cover in a nearby ditch. \\"A little later Pyle and I raised up to look around,\\" Coolidge reported. \\"Another burst hit the road over our heads ... I looked at Ernie and saw he had been hit.\\" A machine-gun bullet had entered Pyle's left temple just under his helmet, killing him instantly. The Ernie Pyle Memorial on Iejima, Japan Pyle was buried wearing his helmet, among other battle casualties on Ie Shima, between an infantry private and a combat engineer.Miller (1950), p. 42. In tribute to their friend, the men of the 77th Infantry Division erected a monument that still stands at the site of his death.N 26 42.656 E 127 47.877 (Google Earth) Its inscription reads: \\"At this spot the 77th Infantry Division lost a buddy, Ernie Pyle, 18 April 1945.\\" See also:\\"We pay our final respects to Ernie Pyle, the Doughboy's best friend.\\" Photo caption in Echoing the sentiment of the men serving in the Pacific theater, General Eisenhower said: \\"The GIs in Europe‚Äì‚Äìand that means all of us‚Äì‚Äìhave lost one of our best and most understanding friends.\\" Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who frequently quoted Pyle's war dispatches in her newspaper column, \\"My Day,\\" paid tribute to him in her column the day after his death: \\"I shall never forget how much I enjoyed meeting him here in the White House last year,\\" she wrote, \\"and how much I admired this frail and modest man who could endure hardships because he loved his job and our men.\\" President Harry S. Truman, who had been in office for less than a week following the death of Franklin Roosevelt on April 12, also paid tribute to Pyle: \\"No man in this war has so well told the story of the American fighting man as American fighting men wanted it told. He deserves the gratitude of all his countrymen.\\" After the war, Pyle's remains were moved to a U.S. military cemetery on Okinawa. In 1949, his remains were some of the first to be interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii. Writing style Pyle's signature storytelling style was developed at IU and during his early years as a human-interest reporter. As a war correspondent he generally wrote from the perspective of the common soldier, explaining how the war affected the men instead of recounting troop movements or the activities of generals. His descriptions of or reactions to an event in simple, informal stories are what set his Pyle's writing apart and made him famous during the war.Johnson and Hays, pp. 48‚Äì49. Fellow journalists praised Pyle's writing. Walter Morrow, editor of the Rocky Mountain News, claimed that Pyle's columns from his travels across the United States in the 1930s were \\"the most widely read thing in the paper.\\" During World War II Pyle continued to write about his experiences from the perspective of what he called \\"the worm's-eye view.\\" In addition to publication of his columns in newspapers in the United States, Pyle's writing was the only writing from a civilian correspondent to be regularly published in the U.S. armed forces newspaper, Stars and Stripes. Pyle's \\"everyman\\" approach to his wartime reporting earned him the Pulitzer Prize for journalism in 1944. Popularity Pyle was well known and popular among the American military.Johnson and Hays, p. 48. Unless the award was very prominent, most soldiers preferred appearing in a Pyle article to receiving a medal. According to Sergeant Mack Morris, whose essay appeared in the U.S. army's weekly newspaper, Yank: \\"The secret of Ernie's tremendous success and popularity, if there is any secret about it, is his ability to report a war on a personal plane.\\"Johnson and Hays, p. 53. Artist George Biddle wrote of how a battalion commander told him that Pyle was a poor writer, but was very popular because \\"he writes about and writes to the great, anonymous American average. They ... are thirsty for recognition and publicity\\". Pyle's newspaper columns were popular in the United States with readers in a wide range of ages from older readers to high school and college students. In November 1942 Pyle's columns were distributed to 42 newspapers, but the number had increased to 122 newspapers by April 1943. When he returned to the United States for a break during the war, reporters and photographers made increasing demands for his time. In 1943 Pyle also gave interviews on radio programs to help sell war bonds.Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, pp. 70, 72‚Äì73. At the time of Pyle's death his columns appeared in 400 daily and 300 weekly newspapers. Legacy Pyle's headstone at Memorial Cemetery in Honolulu Pyle is described as \\"the pre-eminent war correspondent of his era,\\" who achieved worldwide fame and readership for his World War II battlefield reports that were published from 1942 to 1945. Present-day war correspondents, World War II veterans, and historians still recognize Pyle's World War II dispatches as \\"the standard to which every other war correspondent should strive to emulate.\\"Brockman, p. 44. As Life magazine once described Pyle and his work: \\"He now occupies a place in American journalistic letters which no other correspondent of this war has achieved. His smooth, friendly prose succeeded in bridging a gap between soldier and civilian where written words usually fail.\\" Pyle is best remembered for his World War II newspaper reports of the firsthand experiences of ordinary Americans, especially the G.I.s serving in the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe in particular. His legacy also lies in the stories of soldiers who would otherwise be unknown. \\"The Death of Captain Waskow,\\" published in January 1944, is considered Pyle's most famous column. In describing the soldiers he had met, Pyle remarked: > Their life consisted wholly and solely of war, for they were and always had > been front-line infantrymen. They survived because the fates were kind to > them, certainly ‚Äì but also because they had become hard and immensely wise > in animal-like ways of self-preservation. In addition to his writing, Pyle's legacy includes the Ernie Pyle bill, whose content he proposed in one of his columns in early 1944. Congress passed formal legislation in May 1944 to provide American soldiers with a 50 percent increase in pay for their combat service. The U.S. army also adopted Pyle's suggestion of providing overseas service bars on uniforms to designate six months of overseas service.Johnson and Hays, p. 52. Pyle's papers and other archival materials related to his life and work are held at the Lilly Library, Indiana University Bloomington; the Ernie Pyle World War II Museum, Dana, Indiana;Boomhower, The Soldier's Friend, p. 121. the Indiana State Museum; and the Wisconsin State Historical Society. The Indiana Historical Society acquired Ernie and Jerry Pyle's personal library from IU Bloomington's School of Journalism in 2005 and moved the collection to its headquarters in Indianapolis.

Although it did not embody any technological breakthroughs, it is generally credited as the cornerstone of the world's first professional caliber 35mm SLR system.\\" It was produced until October 1973 and was replaced by the Nikon F2. Aspects of its design remain in all of Nikon's subsequent SLR cameras, through the current Nikon F6 film and Nikon D5 digital models (which still share its Nikon F-mount for lenses). The \\"F\\" in Nikon F was selected from the term \\"re-f-lex\\", since the pronunciation of the first letter \\"R\\" is not available in many Asian languages.[imaging.nikon.com/history/chronicle/history-f/ Debut of Nikon F - Design philosophy of single-lens reflex camera Nikon F system], nikon.com, retrieved 1 March 2018 That tradition was carried all the way through their top line of Nikon cameras until the introduction of the Nikon D1 (digital) cameras decades later. Specially modified Nikon F cameras were used in space in the early 1970s aboard the Skylab space station. History Nikon F professional SLR camera with eyelevel prism and early NIKKOR-S Auto 1:1,4 f=5,8cm (1959) The Nikon F was the first 35 mm SLR system to be widely adopted by professional photographers, especially photojournalists covering the Vietnam War, as well as for use by NASA astronauts Camera Systems Carried on Board the Command and Service Module (CSM) on Apollo Lunar Missions. It was originally priced at US$186 with 5 cm f/2 lens; in November 1963 the US price was $233 for the body with a standard prism plus $90 for a 5 cm f/2 lens or $155 for a 5 cm f/1.4. A combination of design elements made the Nikon F successful. It had interchangeable prisms and focusing screens; the camera had a depth-of-field preview button; the mirror had lock-up capability; it had a large bayonet mount and a large lens release button; a single-stroke ratcheted film advance lever; a titanium-foil focal plane shutter; various types of flash synchronization; a rapid rewind lever; a fully removable back. It was well-made, durable, and adhered closely to the successful design scheme of the Nikon rangefinder cameras. The camera was the first to use the F-mount bayonet lens mount system, which is still used as of 2020.

Nikon's Photomic FTn camera and finder Foreground: Nikon F with eyelevel prism; Nikon F with FTn Photomic prism; Nikon F with FTn Photomic prism and F36 motor drive The Nikon F evolved from a rangefinder camera, the Nikon SP. The prototype model, in particular, was an SP with a mirror box, pentaprism and larger lens mount grafted on.\\"The Nikon,\\" by Frank Mechelhoff The F was a modular system camera, with various assemblies such as viewfinders, focusing screens, and motor drives for 36-exposure and 250-exposure film cassettes. Third parties manufactured other film backs, such as two Speed Magny film backs‚Äîone using Polaroid 100 (later 600) type pack films, and another designed for 4x5 film accessories including Polaroid's own 4x5 instant film back. Each of these assemblies could be fitted and removed, allowing the camera to adapt to almost any task. The F36 motor drive, one of the first popular motor drives for SLR cameras, was capable of firing up to 4 frames per second with the mirror locked up or 3 frames per second with full reflex viewing maintained. The Nikon F had a wide range of lenses, covering 21 mm to 1000 mm focal length by 1962. Nikon was among the first companies to manufacture Catadioptric system lens designs, combining mirrors and lenses to make more-compact lenses with longer focal lengths. The Nikon F revolutionized the photographic market, stealing the thunder of German manufacturers Leica and Zeiss. The F had a reputation for being extremely resilient to damage or mechanical failure, becoming known as \\"the hockey puck.\\" In some markets, the camera was marketed as a \\"Nikkor F\\" due to trademark conflicts. In Germany, \\"Nikon\\" was seen as too similar to the Zeiss Ikon camera line. Nikkor F cameras have become collector's items. Example of a Nikon Photomic FTn image ‚Äì Timothy Leary, family, and band (1969). The first Nikon F Photomic viewfinder, delivered since 1962,Nikon F - Nikon F Metering Prisms and Meters Mir had an independent photocell. Then Nikon introduced the Photomic T (superseded by the Photomic Tn), which featured through-the-lens (TTL) metering. The final metering prism for the Nikon F, the Photomic FTn,The Nikon FTN finder introduced in 1968, provided 60% center-weighted TTL, which became the standard metering pattern for Nikon cameras for decades afterwards. Additional viewfinders included a waist-level viewer, a 6 power magnifying finder, and an \\"action finder\\" with a larger viewable area through which one could see the entire frame while wearing goggles and/or a helmet. The Nikon F was succeeded in 1972 by the Nikon F2 series after a production total of 862,600 bodies. Subsequent \\"single-digit\\" F cameras continued as the top of Nikon's professional line of film SLRs, through the Nikon F6 introduced in 2004. Since the introduction of the digital Nikon D1 in 1999, Nikon has continued to reserve single-digit model numbers for top-of-the-line cameras.

Sunglasses or sun glasses (informally called shades or sunnies; more names below) are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes. They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened. In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters then being an American slang term for glasses). Since the 1930s, sunglasses have been a popular fashion accessory, especially on the beach. The American Optometric Association recommends wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet radiation (UV) whenever a person is in the sunlightAmerican Optometric Association, \\"UV Protection ‚Äì Sunglasses Shopping Guide \\". Accessed August 27, 2015. to protect the eyes from UV and blue light, which can cause several serious eye problems. Its usage is mandatory immediately after some surgical procedures, such as LASIK, and recommended for a certain time period in dusty areas, when leaving the house and in front of a TV screen or computer monitor after LASEK. It is important to note that dark glasses that do not block UV radiation can be more damaging to the eyes than not wearing eye protection at all, since they tend to open the pupil and allow more UV rays into the eye.  History  = Precursors = Inuit snow goggles function by reducing exposure to sunlight, not by reducing its intensity Antoine Lavoisier conducting an experiment related to combustion generated by amplified sun light. In prehistoric and historic time, Inuit peoples wore flattened walrus ivory \\"glasses\\", looking through narrow slits to block harmful reflected rays of the Sun. Inuit hero 'Nanook' from the silent documentary film Nanook of the North (1922) wearing whale bone snow-goggles Retrieved December 5, 2014 It is said that the Roman emperor Nero liked to watch gladiator fights using cut emeralds. These, however, appear to have worked rather like mirrors. Sunglasses made from flat panes of smoky quartz, which offered no corrective powers but did protect the eyes from glare, were used in China in the 12th century or possibly earlier. Ancient documents describe the use of such crystal sunglasses by judges in ancient Chinese courts to conceal their facial expressions while questioning witnesses. James Ayscough began experimenting with tinted lenses in spectacles in the mid-18th century, around 1752. These were not \\"sunglasses\\" as that term is now used; Ayscough believed that blue- or green-tinted glass could correct for specific vision impairments. Protection from the Sun's rays was not a concern for him. One of the earliest surviving depictions of a person wearing sunglasses is of the scientist Antoine Lavoisier in 1772. Yellow/amber and brown-tinted spectacles were also a commonly prescribed item for people with syphilis in the 19th and early 20th centuries because sensitivity to light was one of the symptoms of the disease. = Modern developments = In 1913, Crookes lenses were introduced, made from glass containing cerium, which block ultraviolet light. In the early 1920s, the use of sunglasses started to become more widespread, especially among movie stars. Inexpensive mass-produced sunglasses made from celluloid were first produced by Sam Foster in 1929. Foster found a ready market on the beaches of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he began selling sunglasses under the name Foster Grant from a Woolworth on the Boardwalk. By 1938, Life magazine wrote of how sunglasses were a \\"new fad for wear on city streets ... a favorite affectation of thousands of women all over the U.S.\\" It stated that 20 million sunglasses were sold in the United States in 1937, but estimated that only about 25% of American wearers needed them to protect their eyes. Polarized sunglasses first became available in 1936, when Edwin H. Land began experimenting with making lenses with his patented Polaroid filter. In 1947, the Armorlite Company began producing lenses with CR-39 resin.http://www.ppgoptical.com/getmedia/47e39594-6472-48e7-8e2c-8f48015284c8/CR39_50years_booklet.pdf At present, Xiamen, China, is the world's largest producer of sunglasses, with its port exporting 120 million pairs each year.  Functions  Effect of pair of polarized filters = Visual clarity and comfort = Sunglasses can improve visual comfort and visual clarity by protecting the eye from glare. Various types of disposable sunglasses are dispensed to patients after receiving mydriatic eye drops during eye examinations. The lenses of polarized sunglasses reduce glare reflected at some angles off shiny non-metallic surfaces, such as water. They allow wearers to see into water when only surface glare would otherwise be seen, and eliminate glare from a road surface when driving into the sun. = Protection = Broad temple arms protect against \\"stray light\\" entering from the sides Sunglasses offer protection against excessive exposure to light, including its visible and invisible components. The most widespread protection is against ultraviolet radiation, which can cause short-term and long-term ocular problems such as photokeratitis, snow blindness, cataracts, pterygium, and various forms of eye cancer. Medical experts advise the public on the importance of wearing sunglasses to protect the eyes from UV; for adequate protection, experts recommend sunglasses that reflect or filter out 99% or more of UVA and UVB light, with wavelengths up to 400 nm. Sunglasses that meet this requirement are often labeled as \\"UV400\\". This is slightly more protection than the widely used standard of the European Union (see below), which requires that 95% of the radiation up to only 380 nm must be reflected or filtered out.Siegfried H√ºnig, in consultation with Albert J.

Special eyewear known as solar viewers are required for direct viewing of the sun. This type of eyewear can filter out UV radiation harmful to the eyes. More recently, high-energy visible light (HEV) has been implicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration; before, debates had already existed as to whether \\"blue blocking\\" or amber tinted lenses may have a protective effect.American Academy of Ophthalmollogy. \\"Information from Your Eye M.D.: Sunglasses.\\" November 2003. Some manufacturers already design glasses to block blue light; the insurance company Suva, which covers most Swiss employees, asked eye experts around Charlotte Rem√© (ETH Z√ºrich) to develop norms for blue blocking, leading to a recommended minimum of 95% of the blue light.Article by Charlotte Rem√©, who also developed the guidelines/norms for Switzerland: Sunglasses are especially important for children, as their ocular lenses are thought to transmit far more HEV light than adults (lenses \\"yellow\\" with age). There has been some speculation that sunglasses actually promote skin cancer. This is due to the eyes being tricked into producing less melanocyte- stimulating hormone in the body.  Assessing protection  Stanley Vexis safety sunglasses have a scratch resistant coating, block 99.9% UV, and meet ANSI Z87.1 and CSA Z94.3 standards. The only way to assess the protection of sunglasses is to have the lenses measured, either by the manufacturer or by a properly equipped optician. Several standards for sunglasses (see below) allow a general classification of the UV protection (but not the blue light protection), and manufacturers often indicate simply that the sunglasses meet the requirements of a specific standard rather than publish the exact figures. The only \\"visible\\" quality test for sunglasses is their fit. The lenses should fit close enough to the face that only very little \\"stray light\\" can reach the eye from their sides, or from above or below, but not so close that the eyelashes smear the lenses. To protect against \\"stray light\\" from the sides, the lenses should fit close enough to the temples and/or merge into broad temple arms or leather blinders. It is not possible to \\"see\\" the protection that sunglasses offer. Dark lenses do not automatically filter out more harmful UV radiation and blue light than light lenses. Inadequate dark lenses are even more harmful than inadequate light lenses (or wearing no sunglasses at all) because they provoke the pupil to open wider. As a result, more unfiltered radiation enters the eye. Depending on the manufacturing technology, sufficiently protective lenses can block much or little light, resulting in dark or light lenses. The lens color is not a guarantee either. Lenses of various colors can offer sufficient (or insufficient) UV protection. Regarding blue light, the color gives at least a first indication: Blue blocking lenses are commonly yellow or brown, whereas blue or gray lenses cannot offer the necessary blue light protection. However, not every yellow or brown lens blocks sufficient blue light. In rare cases, lenses can filter out too much blue light (i.e., 100%), which affects color vision and can be dangerous in traffic when colored signals are not properly recognized. High prices cannot guarantee sufficient protection as no correlation between high prices and increased UV protection has been demonstrated. A 1995 study reported that \\"Expensive brands and polarizing sunglasses do not guarantee optimal UVA protection.\\" The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has also reported that \\"[c]onsumers cannot rely on price as an indicator of quality\\". One survey even found that a $6.95 pair of generic glasses offered slightly better protection than expensive Salvatore Ferragamo shades. = Further functions = Protecting his eyes from exposure due to exophthalmos, sunglasses have become the trademark of German singer Heino While non-tinted glasses are very rarely worn without the practical purpose of correcting eyesight or protecting one's eyes, sunglasses have become popular for several further reasons, and are sometimes worn even indoors or at night. Sunglasses can be worn to hide one's eyes. They can make eye contact impossible, which can be intimidating to those not wearing sunglasses; the avoided eye contact can also demonstrate the wearer's detachment, which is considered desirable (or \\"cool\\") in some circles. Eye contact can be avoided even more effectively by using mirrored sunglasses. Sunglasses can also be used to hide emotions; this can range from hiding blinking to hiding weeping and its resulting red eyes. In all cases, hiding one's eyes has implications for nonverbal communication; this is useful in poker, and many professional poker players wear heavily tinted glasses indoors while playing, so that it is more difficult for opponents to read tells which involve eye movement and thus gain an advantage. Artist Elize Ryd wearing sunglasses as part of her costume for the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival.Fashion trends can be another reason for wearing sunglasses, particularly designer sunglasses from high-end fashion brands. Sunglasses of particular shapes may be in vogue as a fashion accessory. The relevance of sunglasses within the fashion industry has included prominent fashion editors' reviews of annual trends in sunglasses as well as runway fashion shows featuring sunglasses as a primary or secondary component of a look. Fashion trends can also draw on the \\"cool\\" image of sunglasses and association with a particular lifestyle, especially the close connection between sunglasses and beach life. In some cases, this connection serves as the core concept behind an entire brand. People may also wear sunglasses to hide an abnormal appearance of their eyes. This can be true for people with severe visual impairment, such as the blind, who may wear sunglasses to avoid making others uncomfortable. The assumption is that it may be more comfortable for another person not to see the hidden eyes rather than see abnormal eyes or eyes which seem to look in the wrong direction. People may also wear sunglasses to hide dilated or contracted pupils, bloodshot eyes due to drug use, chronic dark circles or crow's feet, recent physical abuse (such as a black eye), exophthalmos (bulging eyes), a cataract, or eyes which jerk uncontrollably (nystagmus). Lawbreakers have been known to wear sunglasses during or after committing a crime as an aid to hiding their identities.  Standards  The international standard for sunglasses is ISO 12312, which was published in 2013. Part 1 specifies the physical and optical characteristics of glasses, including a range of UV protection levels. Part 2 specifies the test methods used to validate conformance with Part 1.no author (2004). Requirements of European Directives and Standards Relating to Sunglasses. . Retrieved 21 September 2009.

Special-use  = Land vehicle driving = When driving a vehicle, particularly at high speed, dazzling glare caused by a low Sun, or by lights reflecting off snow, puddles, other vehicles, or even the front of the vehicle, can be lethal. Sunglasses can protect against glare when driving. Two criteria must be met: vision must be clear, and the glasses must let sufficient light get to the eyes for the driving conditions. General-purpose sunglasses may be too dark, or otherwise unsuitable for driving. The Automobile Association and the Federation of Manufacturing Opticians have produced guidance for selection of sunglasses for driving. Variable tint or photochromic lenses increase their optical density when exposed to UV light, reverting to their clear state when the UV brightness decreases. Car windscreens filter out UV light,The Globe and Mail , \\"Does my windshield protect me from the sun?\\", retrieved 6 April 2017 slowing and limiting the reaction of the lenses and making them unsuitable for driving as they could become too dark or too light for the conditions. Some manufacturers produce special photochromic lenses that adapt to the varying light conditions when driving. Lenses of fixed tint are graded according to the optical density of the tint; in the UK sunglasses must be labelled and show the filter category number. Lenses with light transmission less than 75% are unsuitable for night driving, and lenses with light transmission less than 8% (category 4) are unsuitable for driving at any time; they should by UK law be labelled 'Not suitable for driving and road use'. Yellow tinted lenses are also not recommended for night use. Due to the light levels within the car, filter category 2 lenses which transmit between 18% and 43% of light are recommended for daytime driving. Polarised lenses normally have a fixed tint, and can reduce reflected glare more than non-polarised lenses of the same density, particularly on wet roads. Graduated lenses, with the bottom part lighter than the top, can make it easier to see the controls within the car. All sunglasses should be marked as meeting the standard for the region where sold. An anti- reflection coating is recommended, and a hard coating to protect the lenses from scratches. Sunglasses with deep side arms can block side, or peripheral, vision and are not recommended for driving. Even though some of these glasses are proven good enough for driving at night, it is strongly recommended not to do so, due to the changes in a wide variety of light intensities, especially while using yellow tinted protection glasses. The main purpose of these glasses are to protect the wearer from dust and smog particles entering into the eyes while driving at high speeds. = Aircraft piloting = Many of the criteria for sunglasses worn when piloting an aircraft are similar to those for land vehicles. Protection against UV radiation is more important, as its intensity increases with altitude. Polarised glasses are undesirable as aircraft windscreens are often polarised, intentionally or unintentionally, showing Moir√© patterns on looking through the windscreen; and some LCDs used by instruments emit polarised light, and can dim or disappear when the pilot turns to look at them. = Sports = Sunglasses worn by an ocean kayaker Like corrective glasses, sunglasses have to meet special requirements when worn for sports. They need shatterproof and impact-resistant lenses; a strap or other fixing is typically used to keep glasses in place during sporting activities, and they have a nose cushion. For water sports, so-called water sunglasses (also: surf goggles or water eyewear) are specially adapted for use in turbulent water, such as the surf or whitewater. In addition to the features for sports glasses, water sunglasses can have increased buoyancy to stop them from sinking should they come off, and they can have a vent or other method to eliminate fogging. These sunglasses are used in water sports such as surfing, windsurfing, kiteboarding, wakeboarding, kayaking, jet skiing, bodyboarding, and water skiing. Mountain climbing or traveling across glaciers or snowfields requires above-average eye protection, because sunlight (including ultraviolet radiation) is more intense in higher altitudes, and snow and ice reflect additional light. Popular glasses for this use are a type called glacier glasses or glacier goggles. They typically have very dark round lenses and leather blinders at the sides, which protect the eyes by blocking the Sun's rays around the edges of the lenses. Special shaded visors were once allowed in American football; Jim McMahon, quarterback for the Chicago Bears and San Diego Chargers, famously used a sun visor during his professional football career due to a childhood eye injury and almost always wears dark sunglasses when not wearing a football helmet. Darkened visors now require a doctor's prescription at most levels of the game, mainly because concussion protocol requires officials to look a player in the eye, something made difficult by tinted visors. Seal Swim Goggles.jpgSwimming goggles = Space = 2006: Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang wears glasses during a construction mission for the International Space Station Special protection is required for space travel because the sunlight is far more intense and harmful than on Earth, where it is always filtered through the atmosphere. Sun protection is needed against much higher UV radiation and even against harmful infrared radiation, both within and outside the spacecraft. Within the spacecraft, astronauts wear sunglasses with darker lenses and a thin protective gold coating. During space walks, the visor of the astronauts' helmets, which also has a thin gold coating for extra protection, functions as strong sunglasses.no author (no date). Spinoff 2002. Space-Age Shades. Scientific and Technical Information (STI) on the NASA website (retrieved on 21 September 2009) The frames of sunglasses and corrective glasses used in space must meet special requirements. They must be flexible and durable, and must fit firmly in zero-gravity. Reliable fit is particularly important when wearing corrective glasses underneath tight helmets and in space suits: once inside the spacesuit, slipped glasses cannot be touched to push them back into place, sometimes for up to ten hours. Frames and glasses must be designed so that small pieces of the glasses such as screws and glass particles cannot become dislodged, then float and be inhaled. 90% of astronauts wear glasses in space, even if they do not require corrective glasses on Earth, because zero-gravity and pressure changes temporarily affect their vision. The first sunglasses used in a Moon landing were the original pilot sunglasses produced by American Optical. In 1969 they were used aboard the Eagle, the Lunar Module of Apollo 11, the first manned mission to land on the Moon. NASA research primarily by scientists James B. Stephens and Charles G. Miller at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) resulted in special lenses that protected against the light in space and during laser and welding work. The lenses used colored dyes and small particles of zinc oxide, which absorbs ultraviolet light and is also used in sunscreen lotions. The research was later broadened to further terrestrial applications, e.g., deserts, mountains, and fluorescent-lighted offices, and the technology was commercially marketed by a U.S. company.no author (2006).

These lenses are popular with skiers, hunters, boaters and pilots\\". * Blue or purple lenses are popular with shooters as they increase the contrast of orange targets against green foliage or grass backdrops. With the introduction of office computing, ergonomists may recommend mildly tinted glasses for use by display operators, in order to increase contrast. While some blue blocking sunglasses (see above) are produced as regular sunglasses for exposure to bright sunlight, others‚Äîespecially for macular degeneration patients‚Äîdo not block light or other colors in order to function well in regular daylight and even dim sunlight. The latter allow the passage of enough light so normal evening activities can continue, while blocking the light that prevents production of the hormone melatonin. Blue-blocking tinted glasses, i.e. amber or yellow, are sometimes recommended to treat insomnia; they are worn in artificial lighting after dark, to reestablish the circadian rhythm and treat delayed sleep phase disorder. Some models have polarized lenses, made of Polaroid polarized plastic sheeting, to reduce glare caused by light reflected from non-metallic surfaces such as water (see Brewster's angle for how this works) as well as by polarized diffuse sky radiation (skylight). This can be especially useful to see beneath the surface of the water when fishing. A mirrored coating can be applied to the lens. This mirrored coating deflects some of the light when it hits the lens so that it is not transmitted through the lens, making it useful in bright conditions; however, it does not necessarily reflect UV radiation as well. Mirrored coatings can be made any color by the manufacturer for styling and fashion purposes. The color of the mirrored surface is irrelevant to the color of the lens. For example, a gray lens can have a blue mirror coating, and a brown lens can have a silver coating. Sunglasses of this type are sometimes called mirrorshades. A mirror coating does not get hot in sunlight and it prevents scattering of rays in the lens bulk. Sunglass lenses are made of either glass, plastic, or SR-91. Plastic lenses are typically made from acrylic, polycarbonate, CR-39 or polyurethane. Glass lenses have the best optical clarity and scratch resistance, but are heavier than plastic lenses. They can also shatter or break on impact. Plastic lenses are lighter and shatter-resistant, but are more prone to scratching. Polycarbonate plastic lenses are the lightest, and are also almost shatterproof, making them good for impact protection. CR-39 is the most common plastic lens, due to low weight, high scratch resistance, and low transparency for ultraviolet and infrared radiation. SR-91 is a proprietary material that was introduced by Kaenon Polarized in 2001. Kaenon's lens formulation was the first non- polycarbonate material to pass the high-mass impact ANSI Z.87.1 testing. Additionally, it was the first to combine this passing score with the highest marks for lens clarity. Jerry Garcia's sunglasses had a polykrypton-C type of lens which was 'cutting edge' in 1995. Any of the above features, color, polarization, gradation, mirroring, and materials, can be combined into the lens for a pair of sunglasses. Gradient glasses are darker at the top of the lens where the sky is viewed and transparent at the bottom. Corrective lenses or glasses can be manufactured with either tinting or darkened to serve as sunglasses. An alternative is to use the corrective glasses with a secondary lenses such as oversize sunglasses that fit over the regular glasses, clip-on lens that are placed in front of the glasses, and flip-up glasses which feature a dark lens that can be flipped up when not in use (see below). Photochromic lenses gradually darken when exposed to ultraviolet light. = Frames = This sunglass eyeshield uses a nylon half-frame and interchangeable lenses Frames are generally made of plastic, nylon, a metal or a metal alloy. Nylon frames are usually used in sports because they are lightweight and flexible. They are able to bend slightly and return to their original shape instead of breaking when pressure is applied to them. This flex can also help the glasses grip better on the wearer's face. Metal frames are usually more rigid than nylon frames, thus they can be more easily damaged when the wearer participates in sport activities, but this is not to say that they cannot be used for such activities. Because metal frames are more rigid, some models have spring loaded hinges to help them grip the wearer's face better. The end of the resting hook and the bridge over the nose can be textured or have rubber or plastic material to improve hold. The ends of the resting hook are usually curved so that they wrap around the ear; however, some models have straight resting hooks. Oakley, for example, has straight resting hooks on all their glasses, preferring to call them \\"earstems\\". In recent years, manufacturers have started to use various types of woods to make frames for sunglasses. Materials such as bamboo, ebony, rosewood, pear wood, walnut and zebrawood, are used making them non-toxic and nearly allergy free. The construction of a wooden frame involves laser-cutting from planks of wood. Already cut and ground to a uniform size, a buffing wheel is used to sand and buff every piece separately before they are assembled. The laser-cutouts of wood are then glued together by hand (mostly), layer on layer, to produce wooden frames. Some brands have experimented with recycled wood from objects like skateboards, whiskey barrels and baseball bats. Shwood, for example have experimented with these materials, they have even used recycled newspaper to manufacture frames. Their final look can vary according to the color, type and finishing. With wooden sunglasses, various shades of brown, beige, burgundy or black are most common. Wooden sunglasses come in various designs and shapes. However, these sunglasses are usually more expensive than the conventional plastic, acetate or metal frames and require more care. They have been famously worn by the likes of Beyonc√©, Snoop Dogg and Machine Gun Kelly. Frames can be made to hold the lenses in several different ways. There are three common styles: full frame, half frame, and frameless. Full frame glasses have the frame go all around the lenses. Half frames go around only half the lens; typically the frames attach to the top of the lenses and on the side near the top. Frameless glasses have no frame around the lenses and the ear stems are attached directly to the lenses. There are two styles of frameless glasses: those that have a piece of frame material connecting the two lenses, and those that are a single lens with ear stems on each side. Some sports- optimized sunglasses have interchangeable lens options. Lenses can be easily removed and swapped for a different lens, usually of a different color. The purpose is to allow the wearer to easily change lenses when light conditions or activities change. The reasons are that the cost of a set of lenses is less than the cost of a separate pair of glasses, and carrying extra lenses is less bulky than carrying multiple pairs of glasses. It also allows easy replacement of a set of lenses if they are damaged. The most common type of sunglasses with interchangeable lenses has a single lens or shield that covers both eyes. Styles that use two lenses also exist, but are less common. = Nose bridge = Nose bridges provide support between the lens and the face. They also prevent pressure marks caused by the weight of the lens or frame on the cheeks. People with large noses may need a low nose bridge on their sunglasses. People with medium noses may need a low or medium nose bridge. People with small noses may need sunglasses with high nose bridges to allow clearance.  Fashion (alphabetically)  The following types are not all mutually exclusive; glasses may be in Aviator style with mirrored lenses, for example. = Aviator = Aviator sunglassesAviator sunglasses feature oversize teardrop-shaped lenses and a thin metal frame. The design was introduced in 1936 by Bausch & Lomb for issue to U.S. military aviators. As a fashion statement, aviator sunglasses are often made in mirrored, colored, and wrap- around styles. The model first gained popularity in the 1940s when Douglas MacArthur was seen sporting a pair at the Pacific Theatre. However, it was in the late 1960s when the frames became widely used with the rise of the hippie counterculture, which preferred large metallic sunglasses. The brand became an icon of the 1970s, worn by Paul McCartney and Freddie Mercury among others, and was also used as prescription eyeglasses. Aviators' association with disco culture led to a decline in their popularity by 1980. The model saw more limited use throughout the 1980s and 1990s, aided by a 1982 product placement deal, featured most notably in Top Gun and Cobra, with both films causing a 40% rise in 1986. Aviators became popular again around 2000, as the hippie movement experienced a brief revival, and was prominently featured in the MTV show Jackass. = Browline = Based on the eyeglass design of the same name, browline glasses have hard plastic or horn-rimmed arms and upper portions joined to a wire lower frame. A traditional, conservative style based on mid-20th century design, browlines were adapted into sunglasses form in the 1980s and rapidly became one of the most popular styles; it has ebbed and sprung in popularity in the decades that have followed. = Oversized = Oversized sunglasses √† la Jackie OOversized sunglasses, which were fashionable in the 1980s, are now often used for humorous purposes. They usually come in bright colors with colored lenses and can be purchased cheaply. The singer Elton John sometimes wore oversized sunglasses on stage in the mid-1970s as part of his Captain Fantastic act. Since the late 2000s, moderately oversized sunglasses have become a fashion trend. There are many variations, such as the \\"Onassis\\", discussed below, and Dior white sunglasses. Onassis glasses or \\"Jackie O's\\" are very large sunglasses worn by women. This style of sunglasses is said to mimic the kind most famously worn by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the 1960s. The glasses continue to be popular with women, and celebrities may use them, ostensibly to hide from paparazzi. Oversized sunglasses, because of their larger frames and lenses, are useful for individuals who are trying to minimize the apparent size or arch of their nose. Oversized sunglasses also offer more protection from sunburn due to the larger areas of skin they cover, although sunblock should still be used. = Shutter shades = Shutter shades were invented in the late 1940s, became a fad in the early 1980s and have experienced a revival in the early-to-mid 2010s. Instead of tinted lenses, they decrease sun exposure by means of a set of parallel, horizontal shutters (like a small window shutter). Analogous to Inuit goggles (see above), the principle is not to filter light, but to decrease the amount of sun rays falling into the wearer's eyes. To provide UV protection, shutter shades sometimes use lenses in addition to the shutters; if not, they provide very insufficient protection against ultraviolet radiation and blue light. = Teashades = Teashade sunglasses\\"Teashades\\" (sometimes also called \\"John Lennon glasses\\", \\"Round Metal\\", or, occasionally, \\"Granny Glasses\\") were a type of psychedelic art wire-rim sunglasses that were often worn, usually for purely aesthetic reasons, by members of the 1960s counterculture. Pop icons such as Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey, John Lennon, Jerry Garcia, Boy George, Liam Gallagher, Suggs, Ozzy Osbourne, Duckie (Jon Cryer) in Pretty in Pink and Jodie Foster's character in the film Taxi Driver all wore teashades. The original teashade design was made up of medium-sized, perfectly round lenses, supported by pads on the bridge of the nose and a thin wire frame. When teashades became popular in the late 1960s, they were often elaborated: Lenses were elaborately colored, mirrored, and produced in excessively large sizes, and with the wire earpieces exaggerated. A uniquely colored or darkened glass lens was usually preferred. Modern versions tend to have plastic lenses, as do many other sunglasses. Teashades are hard to find in shops today; however, they can still be found at many costume Web sites and in some countries. The term has now fallen into disuse, although references can still be found in literature of the time. \\"Teashades\\" was also used to describe glasses worn to hide the effects of recreational drugs such as marijuana (conjunctival injection) or heroin (pupillary constriction) or just bloodshot eyes. = Wayfarer = Original Ray-Ban WayfarerThe Ray-Ban Wayfarer is a (mostly) plastic-framed design for sunglasses produced by the Ray-Ban company. Introduced in 1952, the trapezoidal lenses are wider at the top than the bottom (inspired by the Browline eyeglasses popular at the time), and were famously worn by James Dean, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Bob Marley, The Beatles and other actors and singers. The original frames were black; frames in many different colors were later introduced. There is often a silver piece on the corners as well. Since the early 1980s, makers have also developed variants of the model, most notably the Clubmaster model, introduced in 1982, essentially Browlines made of plastic. These were mostly popular in the late 1950s and during the 1960s (being linked to the rock-and-roll/blues and Mod cultures), before plastic glasses were displaced by metallic rims popular among the counter-culture. In the late 1970s, the rise of New wave music, New Romanticism and the popularity of The Blues Brothers aside from 50s and 1960s nostalgia and the anti-disco backlash later on brought the model out of near- retirement, becoming the most sold model between 1980 and 1999 aided by a lucrative 1982 product placement deal, which put it on many movies and TV shows such as The Breakfast Club and Moonlighting. 1980s nostalgia and the influence of the hipster subculture and the television series Mad Men boosted Wayfarers once again after a slump in the 1990s and 2000s, also aided by a 2000 redesign (New Wayfarer), surpassing Aviators since 2012. = Wrap-around = Mirrored wrap-around sunglassesWrap-arounds are a style of sunglasses characterized by being strongly curved, to wrap around the face. They may have a single curved semi-circular lens that covers both eyes and much of the same area of the face covered by protective goggles, usually with a minimal plastic frame and single piece of plastic serving as a nosepiece. Glasses described as wraparound may alternatively have two lenses, but again with a strongly curved frame. These were first made in the 1960s as variants of the Aviator model, used by Yoko Ono and Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry films. The modern variant surged in the mid-1980s, heavily based on the then-popular Wayfarer, but adapting it to a more futuristic look. As a backlash against 80s fashion occurred in the 1990s, wraparounds became one of the favorite frames of the decade.  Variants  = Clip-on = Clip-on sunglasses Clip-on glasses are a form of tinted glasses that can be clipped on to eyeglasses for protection from the Sun. An alternative are flip-up glasses. = Gradient lenses = Glasses with gradient lensesGradient lenses go from a darker shade at the top to a lighter one at the bottom, so there will be more protection from sunlight the higher one looks through the lens, but the lower one looks through the lens, the less protection is offered. An advantage is that one can wear them indoors without fear of tripping over something and also allowing the user to see. Wearing sunglasses to nightclubs has become common in recent times, where the gradient lens comes in handy. Gradient lenses may also be advantageous for activities such as flying airplanes and driving automobiles, as they allow the operator a clear view of the instrument panel, low in his line of sight and usually hidden in shadow, while still reducing glare from the view out the windscreen. The Independent (London), has also referred to these style of sunglasses as the Murphy Lens. Double gradient lenses are dark at the top, light in the middle and dark at the bottom. Gradients should not be confused with bifocals and progressive lenses. = Flip-up = Flip-up sunglasses add the benefits of sunglasses to corrective eyeglasses, allowing the wearer to flip up the tinted lenses for indoor use. Alternatives include: clip-on glasses, and wrap around sunglasses that fit over the eyeglasses. = Mirrored = Mirrored aviatorsMirrored lenses have a metallic, partially reflective coating on the outer surface combined with a tinted glass lens. Mirrored lenses of different colors can expand the range of fashion styles.  Other names  There are various words referring to eyepieces with darkened lenses: * Shades is a term used in North America. * Glares is a term popular in India if the glass is dark. * Glints is a term for glasses originating from the \\"glint\\" that is noticeable when somebody wearing glasses moves their head. * Sun spectacles is a term used by some opticians. * Spekkies is a term used predominantly in southern Australia. * Sun specs (also sunspecs) is the shortened form of sun spectacles. * Sunglass a monocle version. * Sun-shades can also refer to the sun-shading eyepiece-type, although the term is not exclusive to these. Also in use is the derivative abbreviation, \\"shades\\". * Dark glasses (also preceded by pair of) ‚Äî generic term in common usage. * Sunnies is used in Australian, South African, UK and New Zealand slang. * Smoked spectacles usually refers to the darkened eyepieces worn by blind people. * Solar shields Usually refers to models of sunglasses with large lenses. * Stunna shades Used as a slang term in the hyphy movement, usually referring to sunglasses with oversized lenses. * Glecks is Scottish slang for glasses or sunglasses. * Cooling glasses is a term used in Southern India (predominantly Kerala) and the Middle East for sunglasses.

Nebelungs have long bodies, wide-set green eyes, long and dense fur, and mild dispositions. The name Nebelung ‚Äî apparently a portmanteau of the German word Nebel ('mist' or 'fog'), and the name of a medieval Germanic saga, Nibelungen-Lied ‚Äî is perhaps derived from the cat's distinctive silky blue-grey coat and from the breed's progenitors, who were named after the two major figures in the Nibelungen- Lied, the German warrior Siegfried and the Icelandic queen Brunhilde. Origin Nebelung male The American foundation of this cat breed was laid by the cats Siegfried (1984) and Brunhilde (1985). Cora Cobb, the owner of Siegfried and Brunhilde, was very impressed by the beauty of her blue-grey cats. Siegfried and Brunhilde looked like a Russian Blue but with a semi-long coat. To find out if it was possible to start a new breed with these cats, Cora got in touch with the geneticist of the American Cat Association. This geneticist, Solveig Pfleuger, said that the breed was best defined as semi- long haired Russian Blue. Supported by Pfleuger, Cobb wrote the breeding standard according to the Russian Blue, but with a difference: its coat length. Russian Blue breeders from The International Cat Association (TICA), however, objected to this, and the breed standard was thus revised to describe a unique breed, resembling blue-grey cats that had been imported from Russia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. TICA was the first association to recognize the Nebelung and provides the breed standard. The goal of the Nebelung breeding program is to produce a blue cat with the same type as those early Russian imports and to combine this type with a thick shimmering coat of medium length. The body and tail are long, the ears large in proportion to the head, and the eyes range in color from yellowish green to green. Size is medium and the body well-muscled. The coat is medium long on the body and longer on the tail, with lighter colored guard hairs. The overall appearance is long, sturdy and well muscled. The Nebelung around the globe The Nebelung is a rather new breed, with breeders in America, Canada, Russia, and Europe. In addition to TICA, the Nebelung is recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA),http://www.acfacat.com/ the World Cat Federation (WCF), Livre Officiel des Origines F√©lines (LOOF), and independent cat associations in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. The breed's availability is still rather limited. Characteristics = Physical characteristics = Nebelungs' eyes range from green to yellowish-green. Nebelung cats are characterized by a long, graceful neck and body, long legs, long coat, and long tail. Slightly oval eyes are a vivid green color, or sometimes a yellow-green. Large, pointed ears sit atop a modified wedge-shaped head that is more pointed than rounded. The overall appearance is of a long, sturdy, well-muscled cat. The soft double coat feels fine and silky; it is gray in color and is tipped with silver. Males and, to a lesser extent, females have a ruff around the neck. The fur on the tail is longer than that on the body. Tufts of fur are found behind the ears and in-between the toes, and the hind legs sport pantaloons. The adult coat reaches its full development when the cat is approximately two years old. Life span of a Nebelung is 16+ years. A Nebelung weighs between 3.5 kg (7.11 lbs) for female and 6.5 kg (14.5 lbs) for male sterilized. =Behavioral characteristics= Nebelung cats are lively, playful, affectionate, good-natured, and intelligent A male nebelung cat showing his belly, ready to receive affection Nebelung cats are lively, playful, affectionate, good-natured, and intelligent. The cat's mild-mannered state and personality may not always reflect the relatively high level of intelligence often found in the breed. In spite of the fact that it is an active cat, it can live very well indoors. Nebelungs prefer their own families and often keep a distance from strangers. They tend to bond with a select few humans and stay loving and devoted throughout their lives. It is, however, a cat that gladly accepts company of its people or of another cat. Nebelungs are very good communicators and will remind their owners of problems. This happens often since Nebelungs can be very picky about things such as litter cleanliness and food type. Many owners of Nebelung cats say that they can act more like dogs at times, being extremely loyal to their owner and family. At times a Nebelung may choose or bond with a specific person within a family group more so than others. They will still enjoy the company of others within the social group but will tend to spend most of their time with said chosen person. They are also known for being easily leash trained with use of a proper harness. It enjoys sitting in a lap and being petted, and will follow its favorite person devotedly from room to room. This is a cat that likes routine, and may require a little time to adjust to changes in the household. Early socialization can help it become more adaptable. In popular culture The Nebelung was featured on the Animal Planet show Cats 101. The character Hairball in the movie Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw was a Nebelung voiced by Frank Welker. The Nebelung is one of the animals which can be given as a Patronus in answer to the user's personality test on Pottermore. In the movie Garden State (film), a Nebelung is featured in a scene with Zack Braff, Peter Sarsgaard and Jean Smart.http://www.cinemacats.com/?p=9916 In the movie Go (film), a Nebelung is in multiple scenes with Timothy Olyphant, the dealer of drugs, Todd.

It covered topics aimed at computer programmers. When launched in 1976, DDJ was the first regular periodical focused on microcomputer software, rather than hardware. In its last years of publication, it was distributed as a PDF monthly, although the principal delivery of Dr. Dobb's content was through the magazine's website. Publication ceased at the end of 2014, with the archived website continuing to be available online. History =Origins= Bob Albrecht edited an eccentric newspaper about computer games programmed in the BASIC computer language, with the same name as the tiny nonprofit educational corporation that he had founded, People's Computer Company (PCC). Dennis Allison was a longtime computer consultant on the San Francisco Peninsula and sometime instructor at Stanford University. The Dobbs title was based on a mashup of the first letters of their names: Dennis and Bob. =First issues= In the first three quarterly issues of the PCC newspaper published in 1975, Albrecht had published articles written by Allison, describing how to design and implement a stripped-down version of an interpreter for the BASIC language, with limited features to be easier to implement. He called it Tiny BASIC. At the end of the final part, Allison asked computer hobbyists who implemented it to send their implementations to PCC, and they would circulate copies of any implementations to anyone who sent a self-addressed stamped envelope. Allison said, Let us stand on each others' shoulders; not each others' toes. The journal was originally intended to be a three-issue xerographed publication. Titled dr. dobb's journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia (with the subtitle Running Light Without Overbyte) it was created to distribute the implementations of Tiny BASIC. The original title was created by Eric Bakalinsky, who did occasional paste-up work for PCC. Dobb's was a contraction of Dennis and Bob. It was at a time when computer memory was very expensive, so compact coding was important. Microcomputer hobbyists needed to avoid using too many bytes of memory. After the first photocopies were mailed to those who had sent stamped addressed envelopes, PCC was flooded with requests that the publication become an ongoing periodical devoted to general microcomputer software. PCC agreed, and hired Jim Warren as its first editor. He immediately changed the title to Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia prior to publishing the first issue in January 1976. =Early years= Jim Warren was DDJ's editor for about a year and a half. While he went on to make a splash with his series of West Coast Computer Faires, subsequent DDJ editors like Marlin Ouverson,Ouverson, Marlin (December 5, 2001). \\"The People's Computer Company Alumni Pages - Marlin Ouverson\\". SVIPX.com.Ouverson, Marlin (December 12, 2009). Preceding, cited essay at author's own site.

Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor, Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw were the co-founders of what would be named the IMAX Corporation (founded in September 1967 as Multiscreen Corporation, Limited), and they developed the first IMAX cinema projection standards in the late 1960s and early 1970s in Canada. Unlike conventional film projectors, the film runs horizontally so that the image width can be greater than the width of the film stock. History A comparison between 35 mm and 15/70 mm negative areas. The IMAX film standard uses 70 mm film run through the projector horizontally. This technique produces an area that is nine times larger than the 35 mm format, and three times larger than 70 mm film which was run conventionally through the projector in a vertical orientation.How Regular Movies Become \\"IMAX\\" Films, by Mark Wilson (Gizmodo.com, published May 29, 2009) The desire to increase the visual impact of film has a long history. In 1929, Fox introduced Fox Grandeur, the first 70 mm film format, but it quickly fell from use.70 mm Grandeur film In the 1950s, the potential of 35 mm film to provide wider projected images was explored in the processes of CinemaScope (1953) and VistaVision (1954), following multi-projector systems such as Cinerama (1952). While impressive, Cinerama was difficult to install and maintain, requiring careful alignment and synchronization of the multiple projectors. During Expo 67 in Montreal, the National Film Board of Canada's In the Labyrinth and Ferguson's Man and the Polar Regions both used complex multi-projector, multi- screen systems. Each encountered technical difficulties that led them to found a company called \\"Multiscreen\\", with a goal of developing a simpler approach. =Multiscreen Corporation= The single-projector/single-camera system they eventually settled upon was designed and built by Shaw based upon a novel \\"Rolling Loop\\" film-transport technology purchased from Peter Ronald Wright Jones, a machine shop worker from Brisbane, Australia.see Film projectors do not continuously flow the film in front of the bulb, but instead \\"stutter\\" the film travel so that each frame can be illuminated in a momentarily-paused still image. This requires a mechanical apparatus to buffer the jerky travel of the film strip. The older technology of running 70 mm film vertically through the projector used only five sprocket perforations on the sides of each frame; however, the IMAX method used fifteen perforations per frame. The previous mechanism was inadequate to handle this intermittent mechanical movement that was three times longer, and so Jones's invention was necessary for the novel IMAX projector method with its horizontal film feed. As it became clear that a single, large-screen image had more impact than multiple smaller ones and was a more viable product direction, Multiscreen changed its name to IMAX. Cofounder Graeme Ferguson explained how the name IMAX originated: > \\"... the incorporation date [of the company was] September 1967. ... [The > name change] came a year or two later. We first called the company > Multiscreen Corporation because that, in fact, was what people knew us as. > ... After about a year, our attorney informed us that we could never > copyright or trademark Multivision. It was too generic. It was a descriptive > word. The words that you can copyright are words like Kleenex or Xerox or > Coca-Cola. If the name is descriptive, you can't trademark it so you have to > make up a word. So we were sitting at lunch one day in a Hungarian > restaurant in Montreal and we worked out a name on a placemat on which we > wrote all the possible names we could think of. We kept working with the > idea of maximum image. We turned it around and came up with IMAX.\\"IMAX at > 30: An Interview with Graeme Ferguson by Wyndham Wise (originally published > in Take One magazine, Issue #17, Fall 1997) The name change actually happened more than two years later, because a key patent filed on January 16, 1970, was assigned under the original name Multiscreen Corporation, Limited. IMAX Chief Administration Officer Mary Ruby was quoted as saying, \\"Although many people may think \\"IMAX\\" is an acronym, it is, in fact, a made-up word.\\" =IMAX Corporation= IMAX projector with horizontal film reel Tiger Child, the first IMAX film, was demonstrated at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan. The first permanent IMAX installation was built at the Cinesphere theatre at Ontario Place in Toronto. It debuted in May 1971, showing the film North of Superior. The installation remained in place during Ontario Place's hiatus for redevelopment. The Cinesphere was renovated while Ontario Place was closed and re-opened on November 3, 2017 with IMAX 70mm and IMAX with laser illumination. During Expo '74 in Spokane, Washington, an IMAX screen that measured was featured in the US Pavilion (the largest structure in the expo). It became the first IMAX Theatre to not be partnered with any other brand of movie theatres. About five million visitors viewed the screen, which covered the viewer's total visual field when looking directly forward. This created a sensation of motion in most viewers, and motion sickness in some. Another IMAX 3D theatre was also built in Spokane; however, its screen-size is less than half. Due to protests, the City of Spokane officials decided to work with the IMAX Corporation to demolish the theatre, under the condition they renovate the former US Pavilion itself into IMAX's first permanent outdoor giant-screen theatre. The plan was to use material on the inside of the structure similar to that used when first constructed. However, it was expected to last only five years, due to weather conditions destroying previous materials. Concept art has been released in videos featured on Spokane's renovation site, and its budget revealed that seating is planned for more than 2,000. The first permanent IMAX Dome installation, the Eugene Heikoff and Marilyn Jacobs Heikoff Dome Theatre at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, opened in San Diego's Balboa Park in 1973. It doubles as a planetarium theater. The first permanent IMAX 3D theatre was built in Vancouver, British Columbia for Transitions at Expo '86, and was in use until September 30, 2009. (official site). It was located at the tip of Canada Place, a Vancouver landmark. = Digital projection = In 2008, IMAX extended its brand into traditional theaters with the introduction of Digital IMAX, a lower-cost system that uses two 2K digital projectors to project on a 1.90:1 aspect ratio screen. This lower-cost option, which allowed for the conversion of existing multiplex theater auditoriums, helped IMAX to grow from 299 screens worldwide at the end of 2007 to over 1,000 screens by the end of 2015. As of September 2017, there were 1,302 IMAX theatres located in 75 countries, of which 1,203 were in commercial multiplexes. The switch to digital projection came at a steep cost in image quality, with 2K projectors having roughly an order of magnitude less resolution than traditional IMAX film projectors. Maintaining the same 7-story screen size would only make this loss more noticeable, so many new theaters were instead built with significantly smaller screens. These newer theaters with much lower resolution and much smaller screens soon began to be referred to by the derogatory name \\"LieMAX\\", particularly because the company still marketed the new screens similarly to the old ones, without making the major differences clear to the public, going so far as to market the smallest \\"IMAX\\" screen, having 10 times less area, similarly to the largest while persisting with the same brand name.Maintaining The IMAX Experience, From Museum To Multiplex, by Elizabeth Blair (NPR.org, May 2, 2014)The Shrinking IMAX Screen, originally published in the LF Examiner, April 2010 Since 2002, some feature films have been converted into IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres, and some have also been (partially) shot in IMAX. By late 2017, 1,302 IMAX theatre systems were installed in 1,203 commercial multiplexes, 13 commercial destinations, and 86 institutional settings in 75 countries, with less than a quarter of those having the capability to show 70mm film at the resolution of the large format as originally conceived. Technical aspects =Camera= An IMAX cinema camera, displayed at the National Media Museum, Bradford, UK Film cameras The IMAX cinema process increases the image resolution by using larger film frame; in relative terms, a frame of IMAX format film has three times the theoretical horizontal resolution of a frame of 35mm film. To achieve such increased image resolution, which IMAX estimates at approximately 12,000 lines of horizontal resolution (12K), 65mm film stock passes horizontally through the IMAX movie camera, 15 perforations at a time. At 24 frames per second, this means that the film moves through the camera at 102.7 metres per minute (just over 6 km/h). In a conventional 65mm camera, the film passes vertically through the camera, five perforations at a time, or 34 metres per minute. In comparison, in a conventional 35mm camera, 35mm film passes vertically through the camera, at four (smaller) perforations at a time, which translates to 27.4 metres per minute. In the Todd-AO 70mm-format of widescreen cinema, the image area of a 65mm film-frame is ; in the IMAX-format of widescreen cinema, the film-frame dimensions are . To match the standard image resolution of the moving image produced with the film-speed of 24 frames per second, an IMAX film requires three times the length of (negative) film stock required for a 65mm film of comparable scope and cinematic technique. Phantom 65 IMAX 3D digital camera In 2011, IMAX announced a 4K 3D digital camera. The camera was developed alongside Vision Research and AbelCine, integrating two Phantom 65 engines. A prototype camera was used for the documentary Born to be Wild, in which approximately 10% of the finished film was shot with the system. The company has said they have no intention of replacing the higher resolution film cameras with the new digital camera, but the latter can be used in scenes that require a lightweight or relatively small 3D camera. While IMAX has completed the production camera and has placed it in service on several films, they have no plans to produce an IMAX film solely with the new digital system. Transformers: Age of Extinction is the first feature film partially filmed with the Phantom 65 IMAX 3D camera. ARRI Alexa IMAX digital camera In 2015, IMAX announced a 2D digital camera that was developed alongside Arri, the camera being based on the latter company's Arri Alexa 65 technology. The first production to use the camera was Captain America: Civil War. The Russo brothers have stated that they solely used the Arri Alexa IMAX on Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). For Transformers: The Last Knight, two ARRI Alexa IMAX cameras were combined in a rig to provide native 3D, with the film containing 98% of IMAX footage. =Film stock= The IMAX format is generically called \\"15/70\\" film, the name referring to the 15 sprocket holes or perforations per frame. The film's bulk and weight require horizontal platters, rather than conventional vertically-mounted film reels. IMAX film is fed through the projector horizontally, and the film is drawn from the inner circumference of the platter, not from the outer circumference like in conventional film reels. A system is in place to keep the film in the outer circumference from flying outwards due to centrifugal force while the platter is spinning. IMAX film is shipped to theaters in several small reels that are spliced into one continuous length that is then wound into a platter, a process that may take hours to complete. Films may be several kilometers in length: Avatar, which was 2:45 hours long, was close to 16 kilometers long. Platters are handled using special forklifts. IMAX platters range from diameter to accommodate 1 to 2.75 hours of film. Platters with a 2.5 hour feature film weigh . IMAX uses ESTAR-based print filmKodak's trade name for biaxially oriented PET film in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based print film provides greater precision. The chemical development process does not change the size or shape of ESTAR print film, and IMAX's pin registration system (especially that of the camera mechanism) does not tolerate either sprocket-hole or film-thickness variations, but the film can still swell or shrink under varying temperature and humidity, this requires projection booths to be kept at a temperature of between 20 and 23.8¬∞C and a humidity of 50%. The film is too large to be moved using its sprokets, so they are instead used for registration, to aid in aligning the film. A feature film platter can cost US$36,000 to print. The camera negative is actually 65mm film stock, but it runs horizontally and with 15 perforations per frame. The camera, like the projector, has a vacuum system; this makes the camera noisy, forbidding the recording of quiet scenes. The camera has enough film for 3 minutes of shooting. The large frame of the film also imposes optical limitations such as an extremely shallow depth of field when shooting with an open aperture. =Soundtrack - double-system= To use more of the image area, IMAX film does not include an embedded soundtrack. Instead, the IMAX system specifies a separate six-channel magnetic film, recorded and played back on a film follower locked to picture, just as Vitaphone had been (utilizing 16-inch 33 1/3 RPM electrical transcription discs) in the early 20th century, and was the same technology used to provide the 7-channel soundtrack accompanying films photographed and exhibited in the Cinerama process in the mid-1950s. By the early 1990s, a separate DTS-based 6-track digital sound system was used, similarly locked to the projector by a SMPTE time code synchronization apparatus, the audio played off a series of proprietarily encoded CD-ROM discs. In the late 1990s, IMAX upgraded this system to use a hard drive that carries a single uncompressed audio file that contains the six channels. These are converted directly to analogue rather than processed through a decoding method such as DTS. Like conventional theatres, IMAX theatres place speakers both directly behind the acoustically- transparent screen, and around the theatre to create a \\"surround sound\\" effect. IMAX also provides a \\"top center\\" speaker in addition to the centre speaker found in conventional theatres. This extra channel allows the sound mix engineers to take advantage of the screen's greater height. =Projectors= Xenon short-arc lamp used in IMAX projectors Transporting the large film stock through the optical system presented challenges for both the camera and the projector. Conventional 70 mm systems were not steady enough for the 586√ó magnification. On the projector side, William Shaw adapted an Australian patent (no. 291,375) for film transport called the \\"rolling loop\\" by adding a compressed air \\"puffer\\" to accelerate the film, and put a cylindrical lens in the projector's \\"aperture block\\". The rolling loop mechanism is used to move the film in projectors and cameras; the sprokets in the film are only used for registration as the film is too large to be moved with sprokets at the necessary speeds for projection and filming without damage. The projector uses a vacuum to pull the film into contact with this lens. Thus the \\"field flattener\\" flattens the image field. The lens is twice the height of the film and connects to a pneumatic piston so it can be moved up or down while the projector is running. This way, if a piece of dust comes off the film and sticks to the lens, the projectionist can switch to a clean portion of the lens at the push of a button. The lens also has \\"wiper bars\\" made of a felt or brush-like material that wipes dust off the lens as it moves up or down. The projector uses a vacuum to keep the film flat and oriented correctly for projection. The shutter of an IMAX projector is also kept open for longer than a 35mm projector shutter to increase image brightness. IMAX projectors are pin-stabilized; this means that four registration pins engage the perforations at the corners of the projected frame to ensure perfect alignment. Shaw added cam-controlled arms to decelerate each frame to eliminate the microscopic shaking as the frame \\"settled\\" onto the registration pins. The projector's shutter is open around 20% longer than in conventional equipment, and the light source is brighter. The xenon short-arc lamps are made with a thin envelope of fused quartz and contain xenon gas at a pressure of about 25 atmospheres (). Because of this, projectionists are required to wear protective body armor when changing or handling the lamp in case it breaks (e.g., due to a drop to the floor) because of the danger from flying quartz shards propelled by the high pressure of the xenon gas within; this applies to all projection xenon lamps. An IMAX xenon lamp runs on DC power, lasts for 1000 hours and requires its own pump and water cooler, also the projector's optics require compressed air cooling. An IMAX projector weighs up to 1.8 tonnes (2 short tons) and is over tall and long. The projector is raised and locked into position before each screening. IMAX Corporation has released four projector types that use its 15-perforation, 70 mm film format: GT (Grand Theatre), GT 3D (dual rotor), SR (Small Rotor), and MPX, which was designed for retrofitted theatres. In July 2008, the company introduced a digital projection system, which it has not given a distinct name or brand, designed for multiplex theatres with screens no wider than . All IMAX projectors, except the standard GT system, can project 3D images. GT 3D projectors require two separate lamps and polarized projection optics. Digital projection AMC Barton Creek Square 14 in Austin, Texas The digital cinema IMAX projection system, debuted in 2008, is designed to use with shorter 1.90:1 aspect ratio screens. The system uses two 2K projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in DCI or IMAX Digital Format (IDF) (which in itself is a superset of DCI). IDF initially used 2K-resolution Christie xenon projectors, with a Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing (DLP) engine, but in 2012 IMAX announced that they would be switching to Barco as their primary supplier. The two 2K images are projected superimposed on each other with a half-pixel offset, using super-resolution imaging to increase the perceived resolution to approximately 2.9K. For 3D presentations, one projector is used to display the image for each eye, while 2D presentations use the superimposed images to allow for a brighter 22-foot lambert image. The Digital IMAX projection system includes a proprietary IMAX Image Enhancer that modifies the output of the digital media server based on feedback from cameras and microphones in the auditorium, and maintains alignment with sub-pixel accuracy. Mainly because the system facilitates inexpensive distribution of IMAX features, the company announced in February 2012 that they were re-renovating specially selected locations around the world to present both 70mm analog as well as digital presentations. To do so, IMAX developed a rail system that moves the projectors in and out to accommodate either a full-frame film print or a digital-only release. These theaters were prepared in time for the release of The Dark Knight Rises in July 2012. Laser projection In April 2012, IMAX began testing a new 4K laser projection system, based on patents licensed from Eastman Kodak. Like the 3D film and digital systems, it used two projectors, but it improved over the smaller digital screens by retaining the traditional IMAX aspect ratio and let films be shown on screens wide or more. In December 2014, IMAX began rolling out its new Dual 4K laser projector system, dubbed \\"IMAX with Laser\\", with the first installation occurring at the Cineplex ScotiaBank Theatre in Toronto. The system allows digital projection on the full 1.43:1 aspect ratio surface of a traditional IMAX screen, but can also be used on wider screens such as the 1.90:1-aspect-ratio TCL Chinese Theater. The system replaces the xenon arc lamp of a traditional digital projector with a laser light source, and is capable of 60 fps with \\"50 percent greater\\" brightness than the Digital Cinema Initiatives spec, a contrast ratio \\"double\\" that of IMAX 15/70mm film projection and \\"higher\\" than the 2500:1 contrast ratio of IMAX's xenon lamp- based projection systems, and displaying the full Rec. 2020 color gamut/space. The system also features a new 12-channel surround sound system, which adds an additional speaker on either side of the theater as well as four new overhead speakers. While still not matching the theoretical resolution of traditional IMAX film, which is estimated at up to 12 thousand lines of horizontal resolution on the 65mm camera negative (12K) and approximately 6 thousand on a 35mm release print (6K), the new laser system features dual-4K resolution projectors, each capable of displaying four times the detail of one Digital IMAX projector. Like Digital IMAX, images from the two projectors are projected superimposed on each other with a half-pixel offset, using super- resolution imaging, which makes the perceived resolution greater than 4K. In- theater cameras and microphones are used to automatically calibrate the projectors and sound system between showings. For 3D presentations, one projector is used to display the image for each eye, while 2D presentations use the superimposed images to allow for a brighter image. For 3D presentations, IMAX with Laser systems use dichroic filter glasses, similar to those used by Dolby 3D, as opposed to the linear polarization glasses used in Digital IMAX theaters. On April 24, 2018, IMAX announced that they would begin rolling out a new single-unit version of their laser projector system later that year, with this iteration designed to replace the IMAX Xenon digital projection system for 1.90:1 screens. =Theatres= IMAX theatres are described as either \\"Classic Design\\" (purpose-built structures), or \\"Multiplex Design\\" (retrofitted auditoriums). Classic IMAX theatre construction differs significantly from conventional theatres. The increased resolution lets the audience be much closer to the screen. Typically all rows are within one screen height ‚Äî conventional theatre seating runs 8 to 12-screen heights. Also, the rows of seats are set at a steep angle (up to 30¬∞ in some domed theatres) so that the audience is facing the screen directly. A standard IMAX screen is , but can be significantly larger. Until 2016, the world's largest IMAX screen was in Darling Harbour, Sydney, Australia, and measured .World's biggest movie screen - 29.7m high and 35.7m wide - installed at Sydney Imax . News.com.au - February 10, 2012. Retrieved September 14, 2013.. Retrieved September 14, 2013. Since then, the current largest operating IMAX screen is in Melbourne, Australia and measures . The Sydney IMAX reconstruction, which began in 2016 and is due to be completed in late 2020, includes an even larger screen ensuring it retains the record as the largest IMAX screen. Variations =Dome and Omnimax= Outside of the IMAX dome in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico Planetario Alfa, museum, astronomical observatory and IMAX Dome system, Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico The frame layout of the IMAX Dome film The control room of an IMAX Dome theatre at Cosmonova at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, Sweden Closeup of an IMAX Dome 70mm film reel at Cosmonova In the late-1960s, the San Diego Hall of Science (now known as the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center) began searching North America for a large-format film system to project on the dome of their planned tilted dome planetarium. The standard IMAX projector was unsuitable for use inside a dome because it had a tall lamp house on top. IMAX Corporation redesigned its system, adding an elevator to lift the projector to the center of the dome from the projection booth below. Spectra Physics designed a suitable lamphouse that took smaller, lamps and placed the bulb behind the lens instead of above the projector. In 1970, Ernst Leitz Canada, Ltd. (now ELCAN Optical Technologies) won a contract to develop and manufacture a fisheye lens projection system optimized to project an image onto a dome instead of a flat screen. The dome system, which the San Diego Hall of Science called \\"Omnimax\\", uses films shot with a camera equipped with a fisheye lens that squeezes a highly-distorted anamorphic 180¬∞ field of view onto the 65 mm IMAX film. The lens is aligned below the center of the frame, and most of the bottom half of the circular field falls beyond the edge of the film. The part of the field that would fall below the edge of the dome is masked. When filming, the camera is aimed upward at an angle that matches the tilt of the dome. When projected through a matching fisheye lens onto a dome, the original panoramic view is recreated. Omnimax wraps 180¬∞ horizontally, 100¬∞ above the horizon and 22¬∞ below the horizon for a viewer at the center of the dome. Omnimax premiered in 1973, showing Voyage to the Outer Planets (produced by Graphic Films) and Garden Isle (by Roger Tilton Films) on a double bill. IMAX has since renamed the system \\"IMAX Dome\\", but some theaters (primarily those opened before the 2000s) continue to call it \\"Omnimax\\". IMAX Dome theatres are used in theme parks and many North American museums, particularly those with a scientific focus, where the technical aspects of the system may be highlighted as part of the attraction. The projection room is often windowed to allow public viewing of the equipment in operation, and it is often accompanied by informational placards like other exhibits. For some theaters, before the show begins, the screen can be backlit to show the speakers and girders behind it. The screen may be a permanent fixture, such as at the Museum of Science and Industry (Henry Crown Space Center) in Chicago, Illinois; the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History; the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the St. Louis Science Center; Boston's Museum of Science; Richmond's Science Museum of Virginia; the Charlotte Observer IMAX Dome Theatre at Discovery Place, Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama's McWane Science Center; US Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama; the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal and Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, Ohio, and the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Alternatively, the dome may be lowered and raised as needed, such as at the Science Museum of Minnesota, and the former installation at the Canadian Museum of History (where it shared an auditorium with a standard IMAX screen, all replaced with a Barco CINE+ digital theatre system in 2016). The entire dome could be raised to show flat screen features, and repositioned for immersive features. While the majority of museum installations focus on educational and documentary films, on special occasions entertainment films are also shown, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. The largest screen in North America is at the Science World in Vancouver, British Columbia, which has a dome screen in size. Due to the age of the IMAX Dome format as well as its entirely analogue nature, some theatres may opt to replace their existing IMAX Dome systems with newer, more versatile digital systems. Examples of former IMAX Dome theatres that have had their IMAX equipment replaced with newer equipment include Tietomaa Science Centre in Oulu, Finland (which replaced its IMAX 8/70 equipment from 1988 with a Barco DP4K-32B 4K projection system in 2013), the Omni-Theatre at Science Centre Singapore, the National Museum of Natural Science in Taichung, Taiwan (which both had their original IMAX Dome 1570 projection systems installed respectively in 1987 and 1985 replaced with Evans & Sutherland Digistar 5 8K digital systems in 2015), and the Jennifer Chalsty Planetarium at Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey, which replaced its IMAX Dome 1570 projection system from 1993 (when built was the largest IMAX Dome/OMNIMAX theatre in the world) with an Evans & Sutherland Digistar 6 \\"True8K\\" digital system in 2017. In November 2018, the Hackworth IMAX dome in The Tech Museum (now The Tech Interactive) replaced its 70mm IMAX projector with a 4K IMAX Laser projector. It became the first digital IMAX Laser dome theater in the world. = 3D = To create the illusion of depth, the IMAX 3D process uses two separate camera lenses that represent the left and right eyes. The lenses are separated by a distance of , the average distance between a human's eyes. Two separate rolls of film are used to capture the images they produce. The IMAX 3D camera weighs over . By projecting the two films superimposed on the screen and using one of several available methods to direct only the correct image to each eye, viewers see a 3D image on a 2D screen. One method is to use polarizing filters to oppositely polarize the light used in projecting each image. The viewer wears glasses with polarizing filters oriented to match the projector filters, so that the filter over each eye blocks the light used to project the images intended for the other eye. In another method, the two projections rapidly alternate. While one image is being shown, the projection of its mate is blocked. Each frame is shown more than once to increase the rate and suppress flicker. The viewer wears shutter glasses with liquid crystal shutters that block or transmit light in sync with the projectors, so each eye sees only the images meant for it. Several of the early films that had been produced in digital 3D for release in conventional theaters were also presented in IMAX 3D, including Avatar, Gravity and The Amazing Spider-Man. The first full-color IMAX 3D film was the 1986 short documentary Transitions, produced for Expo 86 in Vancouver. =HD= Variations on IMAX included the 48 frames per second IMAX HD process, which sought to produce smoother, more lifelike motion, while also reducing the blurring of moving objects, by doubling the normal film rate. The IMAX HD system was tested in 1992 at the Canada Pavilion of the Seville Expo '92 with the film Momentum. Higher production costs, and the high \\"wear-and-tear\\" on the prints and projectors, doomed the IMAX HD system, but, not before many theatres had been retrofitted to project at 48 frames, especially in Canada, in order to play Momentum. In the 1990s theme parks in Thailand, Germany, and Las Vegas used IMAX HD for their Motion Simulator rides. The Disney parks attraction Soarin' Over California features a modification of both IMAX HD and IMAX Dome, projecting in 48 frames per second. = Digital = Because 70mm film and projectors are costly and difficult to mass produce, and because the size of auditoriums that house full-size IMAX screens make them expensive to construct, IMAX debuted a digital projection system in 2008 to use with shorter 1.90:1 aspect ratio screens. It uses two 2K-resolution projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in DCI or IMAX Digital Format (IDF) (which in itself is a superset of DCI). The digital installations have caused some controversy, as many theaters have branded their screens as IMAX after merely retrofitting standard auditoriums with IMAX digital projectors. The screen sizes in these auditoriums are much smaller than those in the purpose-built auditoriums of the original 15/70 IMAX format, and are limited to the 1.90:1 aspect ratio. Another disadvantage is the much lower resolution of digital IMAX. The technology has a maximum perceived resolution of 2.9K, compared to traditional IMAX 70mm projection, which has an estimated resolution of 12K. Some reviewers have also noted that many non-IMAX theaters are projecting films at 4K resolution through competing brands such as Dolby Cinema and UltraAVX. IMAX has held to a uniform branding of \\"The IMAX Experience\\" across various underlying technologies and screen sizes.Hyder, James (October 16, 2008). Is IMAX the next \\"New Coke\\"? LF Examiner, October 16, 2008. Retrieved from LFexaminer.com. Some have criticized the company's marketing approach, with the format being dubbed \\"Lie-MAX\\". The company has defended the format by saying it has a bigger screen, brighter picture and better sound than standard theatres. Despite the differences with digital IMAX, the cost-effective format has aided in the company's worldwide growth, especially in Russia and China. =IMAXShift= In May 2016, IMAX announced the test launch of IMAXShift, a multimedia indoor cycling concept, but decided to discontinue it June 4, 2017. =Virtual reality= On September 2, 2016, IMAX announced plans to include virtual reality (VR) into the IMAX theater experience with the opening of a new VR center in Los Angeles that would use a new StarVR headset created by Acer. The VR experience was intended for short but interactive videos. IMAX opened a total of seven IMAX VR centers and established a fund for the creation of VR content, as well as partnering with Google for the production of IMAX VR cameras. However, , four out of the seven IMAX VR centers have closed, and the remaining three are slated to close in early 2019. Films = Entertainment = Audiences view a film using 3D glasses. In the US, IMAX has mostly been used for specialty applications. The expense and logistical challenges of producing and presenting IMAX films have led to approximately 40 minute shorter running times than conventional films. Most are documentaries suited for institutional venues such as museums and science centers. IMAX cameras have been used while orbiting the Earth, climbing Mount Everest, exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and visiting the Antarctic. A film about the Mars Exploration Rovers, titled Roving Mars (2006), used exclusive data from the rovers. An early attempt at presenting mainstream entertainment in IMAX format was The Rolling Stones: Live at the Max (1991), an 85-minute compilation of concert footage filmed in IMAX during the rock band's 1990 Steel Wheels tour, edited to give the impression of a single concert. In the 1990s, more entertainment short films were created, notably T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous in 1998, and Haunted Castle in 2001 (both in 3D). In 1995, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud directed Wings of Courage, the first dramatic picture shot for IMAX. In 1998 and 1999, More and The Old Man and the Sea became the first short films produced using the IMAX format; both earned Academy Award nominations, with Old Man and the Sea becoming the only IMAX film to win an Oscar. In 2000, Disney produced Fantasia 2000, the first full- length animated feature initially released exclusively in the IMAX format. = Use in Hollywood productions = Before the end of the 1990s, theatrical features were deemed impossible to run in IMAX venues at the time, as there was a technical limitation on the size of the film reel where films had to run around two hours. Originally, IMAX and Pixar considered releasing Toy Story in IMAX 3D, but test results showed that the render resolution could not match the size of the IMAX image. DreamWorks in the early 2000s wanted to re-release Shrek in IMAX 3D, but this too was canceled as a result of creative changes in the studio. These failed attempts at re-releases did inspire IMAX to experiment and improve their ability in presenting computer animation in their theaters. Their compilation CyberWorld was the result, which contained new original animation and IMAX-presented versions of computer animated tests and music videos. Cyberworld even presented open-matte 3D versions of the bar sequence from Antz and the \\"Homer3\\" segment from The Simpsons; both coincidentally were animated at Pacific Data Images. Walt Disney Pictures became the first studio to release theatrical films in the IMAX process. Released on New Year's Day in 2000, Fantasia 2000 was the studio's first IMAX release and the first theatrical feature presented in IMAX theaters. It was originally planned as a standard theatrical release, but in agreeing with the company to release the film, the IMAX sound system incorporated a multi- channel and multi-layer stereo system for the orchestrated soundtrack, similar to the Fantasound system Walt Disney had envisioned for the original film in 1940. The company agreed to Disney's terms and conditions to gain the exclusive first showings of the film. These included a limited engagement of four months (from January 1 to April 30) and 50% of the box office receipts. Not all IMAX cinemas were prepared to accept Disney's terms to present the film; however, following the IMAX release, a standard 35mm run followed in June at regular theaters. Although Fantasia 2000 had a lukewarm financial run, the critical praise for its use of the IMAX format convinced Disney to put more releases in the giant-screen format in the pipeline. In 2002, IMAX re- issues of Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King were released in select theaters over the winter and Christmas seasons of that year. New digital masters were created from the original CAPS production files and select scenes of animation were cleaned up to make use of the high resolution IMAX film negatives. Treasure Planet was also released in select IMAX theaters and was the first theatrical film released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously. But all of these releases had underwhelming box office returns and Disney canceled later big-screen re-releases, including Aladdin. With the unveiling of the DMR process (see below), Warner Bros. Pictures especially embraced the format beginning in 2003 with the two Matrix sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions. Since The Prisoner of Azkaban in 2004, Warner Bros. began releasing the Harry Potter film franchise in IMAX to strong financial success. Also in 2004 the studio released Robert Zemeckis' motion-capture film The Polar Express in IMAX 3D. Polar Express became the most successful film released in IMAX theaters, producing at least a quarter of the film's gross of $302 million from fewer than 100 IMAX screens. Success for Warner Bros. and IMAX followed in later years with I Am Legend, Happy Feet, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Progressively other studios became further interested in releasing films in IMAX through the DMR process and have earned success through it. In May 2009, J. J. Abrams's Star Trek was released in IMAX venues for the initial two weeks of its theatrical run and opened to $8.3 million dollars. The IMAX opening weekends of The Avengers and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 have since grossed $15 million. Though they were not filmed with IMAX cameras, Skyfall and The Amazing Spider-Man were optimized for IMAX digital screens when they were released. Both movies were filmed in high-resolution cameras and the digital negative ratio was equal to that of the IMAX Digital frame. Skyfall increased the visual information of the entire film while Amazing Spider-Man optimized the finale battle with the Lizard. When James Cameron's Titanic was restored and re-released in theaters there was also specially made an open-matte version for IMAX. In 2010 after years of successful IMAX DMR releases, Warner Bros. signed a deal to release up to 20 feature films in IMAX up to 2013, including educational documentaries that were in production. In May 2015, Marvel Studios announced that its next two Avengers films ‚Äî Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) ‚Äî would be filmed entirely in IMAX, the first Hollywood feature films to do so, using a modified version of Arri's Alexa 65 digital camera. The camera was used first to film select sequences in another Marvel production, 2016's Captain America: Civil War. =DMR (Digital Media Remastering)= IMAX's proprietary DMR (Digital Media Remastering) process up-converts conventional films to IMAX format. This special digital intermediate technology let IMAX venues show films shot on 35mm for conventional theaters. In 2002, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones and an IMAX-format re-release of the 1995 film Apollo 13, were the first official applications of the DMR process. Because of projection limitations at the time, the studios had to edit Apollo 13 and Attack of the Clones to have a shorter playing time. As IMAX updated the system and expanded the size of the platters, the later DMR releases did not have this limitation; current platters provide a run time of up to 175 minutes. Reviewers have generally praised the results of the DMR blowup process, which are visually and audibly superior to the same films projected in 35mm. But some filmmakers, such as producer Frank Marshall, point out that DMR blowups are not comparable to films created directly in the 70 mm 15 perf IMAX format, and that directors Ron Howard and George Lucas expected better. They note that the decline of Cinerama coincided roughly with its replacement by a simpler, cheaper, technically inferior version, and view DMR with alarm. IMAX originally reserved the phrase \\"the IMAX experience\\" for true 70 mm productions, but now allows its use on DMR productions as well. After The Lion King in 2003, no Hollywood studio engaged in re-releasing and restoring classic films through the IMAX DMR process until 2012 although ongoing conversion of new releases continued and continued to grow in number. James Cameron's Titanic underwent both 3D conversion and DMR conversion to 3D in 2012 as did Men in Black 3. In August 2012 IMAX and Paramount Pictures announced a one-week exclusive re-release of Raiders of the Lost Ark on September 7, 2012, to promote the release of the Blu-Ray collection. The film, before it underwent DMR, was already restored in a 4K digital intermediate with 7.1 surround sound from the original negative. The process for IMAX theaters, like with the complete restoration, was supervised by Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt. \\"I didn't know if the 1981 print would stand up to a full IMAX transfer, so I came expecting a sort of grainy, muddy, and overly enlarged representation of the movie I had made years ago\\", Spielberg said. \\"I was blown away by the fact that it looked better than the movie I had made years ago.\\" =Feature films= Christopher Nolan has been a vocal supporter of the IMAX 70 mm film format, and has collaborated with the company since the mid-2000s. Many recent features have employed IMAX cameras for select scenes, however, before 2018 no full-length feature film was shot entirely using IMAX cameras due to the numerous difficulties presented with the format ‚Äì the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras and the noise they produced made dialogue recording difficult. The 70mm cameras have short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes and the cost of the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. However, these issues have been minimized thanks to the digital Arri Alexa IMAX camera, with two films having been shot entirely with the camera. The Dark Knight features six sequences (a total of 28 minutes) shot using IMAX. According to the film's press notes, this was the \\"first time ever that a major feature film has been even partially shot using IMAX cameras\\".Warner Bros. Pictures press notes, The Dark Knight Even before Dark Knight, Nolan had wanted to shoot a film in the IMAX format, and he also used it for quiet scenes that it would make pictorially interesting. Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: \\"if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie.\\" Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative to eliminate generation loss, while scenes that were digitally mastered were scanned and printed out at 8 thousand lines of horizontal resolution (8K). When the film opened in 94 IMAX venues in 2008, all of them were sold out for the opening weekend. A year later, director Michael Bay was inspired by IMAX's use in The Dark Knight to feature big-screen sequences in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The film's co-writer Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, but Bay later said that considering himself an \\"old school\\" filmmaker, he found 3D gimmicky and added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras. The IMAX version of the film, in the end, contained almost ten minutes of IMAX-filmed footage out of the two and a half hour film. Bay later partially filmed the third Transformers film, Dark of the Moon in 3D but without IMAX. Bay returned to IMAX for the fourth film, Age of Extinction, in 2014. It was the first feature film shot using digital IMAX 3D cameras. He again used IMAX 3D cameras while shooting the fifth film, Transformers: The Last Knight, filming 98% of the film with 2 Alexa/IMAX cameras attached together to a special mount. Two years later, Brad Bird's Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol had 25 minutes of footage shot using IMAX cameras. Bird believed that using IMAX format would bring back \\"a level of showmanship\\" to the presentation of Hollywood films, which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in multiplexes as opposed to grand theaters, and vetoing \\"first runs\\" in favor of wider initial releases. He also added that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion than digital 3D due to its brighter, higher quality image, which is projected on a larger screen, without the need for specialised glasses. Ghost Protocol opened on December 16, 2011, in almost 500 IMAX venues worldwide a week before its wide release where it earned third place in the box office and $12 million dollars. As with The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan decided to film sequences of the sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, in 15/70mm IMAX. Nolan elected not to film in 3D and stated that he intends to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. In a then-Hollywood record, The Dark Knight Rises featured 72 minutes of footage shot in 70mm IMAX (roughly 2.5 times that of The Dark Knight's 28 minutes, however, this record was later overtaken by another Nolan film, Dunkirk, which featured 79 minutes of IMAX) Because of the considerable noise IMAX cameras make, they used standard 65mm cameras to shoot dialogue scenes, and dubbed dialogue in scenes shot with IMAX cameras. Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX plans to run the film in its theaters for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks in some theaters. J. J. Abrams's Star Trek Into Darkness, Francis Lawrence's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Luc Besson's Lucy, and Christopher Nolan's Interstellar are films that were released between 2013 and 2014 that had sequences filmed with 15/70mm IMAX cameras. On July 9, 2014, Bad Robot (J. J. Abrams's production company) confirmed via a picture uploaded to Twitter that one sequence in Disney and Lucasfilm's Star Wars: The Force Awakens would be captured with the IMAX 15/70 perf film camera, in addition to the standard 35mm film cameras that Abrams and his cinematographer Dan Mindel have employed for shooting the movie. The next installment in the franchise Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi, released in December 2017, also included sequences shot with 15/70mm IMAX cameras. Adele's music video \\"Hello\\", released in 2015, became the first music video that was partially filmed with IMAX cameras. In April 2015, Marvel Studios announced that Russo brothers' Captain America: Civil War would be the first film to use the new ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D digital camera, which was used to shoot approximately 15 minutes of the film. In May 2015, the Russo brothers announced that their films Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, released in 2018 and 2019, the first Hollywood feature films shot entirely in IMAX, albeit using ARRI Alexa IMAX cameras instead of 15/70 perf film. Rihanna's music video \\"Sledgehammer\\", released in 2016, was the second music video to use the new ARRI Alexa IMAX camera. Other films between 2016 to 2021 that captured with IMAX cameras were Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Clint Eastwood's Sully, Damien Chazelle's First Man, Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman 1984 and Cary Joji Fukunaga's No Time to Die. Sully was filmed with ARRI Alexa IMAX cameras for almost the entire film. The rest had sequences that were filmed with 15/70mm IMAX cameras. Three Chinese titles have been captured with IMAX digital cameras; selected scenes in Jiang Wen's Gone with the Bullets in 2014, the entirety of Guan Hu's The Eight Hundred and almost all of Detective Chinatown 3 in 2020. Christopher Nolan used 15/70mm IMAX cameras again on his next film, Dunkirk. However, unlike the previous films, where he used the cameras for select sequences, Nolan used IMAX as the primary shooting format, with 75% (about 79 minutes) of the 106-minute film featuring footage shot in 70mm IMAX (breaking the aforementioned record that a previous Nolan film, The Dark Knight Rises, held). This was possible due to the sparsity of dialogue in the film, as 15/70mm IMAX cameras are notoriously noisy (a few dialogue-heavy scenes were shot with regular 70mm film cameras from Panavision). IMAX cameras were also used hand-held for the first time, as Nolan was advised by both Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard that it was the best way to shoot on vessels. Dunkirk received the widest release on 70mm IMAX since his last film, Interstellar, with the film being released on the format in 37 theaters around the world. The director's 2020 film, Tenet was filmed 50% of the entire film with 15/70mm IMAX cameras, the rest of the film was shot with regular 70mm film cameras from Panavision. The film's six-minute opening sequence was shown before IMAX screenings of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Tenet was shown over 13 theaters globally in 70mm IMAX. In September 2020, IMAX announced a new program called 'Filmed in IMAX', a new partnership with the world's leading camera manufacturers to meet filmmaker demand for The IMAX Experience. Through the program, IMAX will certify high- end, best-in-class digital cameras with leading brands including ARRI, Panavision, Red Digital Cinema and Sony to work in the IMAX format when paired with its proprietary post-production process. The new program certifies the ARRI Alexa LF and Mini LF, Panavision Millennium DXL2, Red Ranger Monstro and Sony's CineAlta Venice cameras along with the ARRI Alexa IMAX camera previously announced with ARRI Rental. As part of the program, IMAX will also certify independent camera rental houses who can supply certified cameras worldwide, starting with Panavision, ARRI and Keslow Camera. IMAX will select only a limited number of films to participate in the program each year. Joseph Kosinski‚Äôs Top Gun: Maverick was shot with the Sony CineAlta Venice and Denis Villeneuve‚Äôs Dune was shot on the ARRI Alexa LF and the Mini LF, both will be among the first releases certified as 'Filmed in IMAX' through the new program.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imax-launches-new-filmed-in- imax-program-with-worlds-leading-digital-camera-brands-301133476.html = In space exploration = STS 41-C mission specialist Terry J. Hart, holds a 70-pound IMAX camera in the mid deck of the space shuttle Challenger in 1984. IMAX cameras have flown in space on 17 occasions, NASA astronauts have used handheld IMAX cameras to document missions, and an IMAX camera has also been mounted in the payload bay of the Shuttle. Space shuttle mission STS-41-C filmed the deployment of the LDEF (Long duration exposure facility) and the repair of the Solar Max satellite. This footage was included in the 1985 IMAX movie The Dream is Alive. Kennedy Space Center in Florida has two IMAX 3D theaters. These show space movies, including footage shot on missions and narrated by celebrities. Two of the IMAX cameras used by NASA are now on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.  Awards  In 1996, IMAX was awarded the Oscar for Scientific and Technical Achievement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The award cited IMAX's innovations in creating and developing a method of filming and exhibiting large-format, wide-angle motion pictures. To date, ten native-format IMAX format films have received Academy Awards nomination, with one winner. While on technical aspects and the usage of the IMAX system, only Wally Pfister's cinematography on The Dark Knight has earned a nomination. * The Eruption of Mount St. Helens!, 1980 Documentary Short Subject * Fires of Kuwait, 1992 Documentary Feature * The Living Sea, 1995 Documentary Short Subject * Special Effects: Anything Can Happen, 1996 Documentary Short Subject * Cosmic Voyage, 1996 Documentary Short Subject * Amazon, 1997 Documentary Short Subject * Alaska: Spirit of the Wild, 1997 Documentary Short Subject * More, 1998 Animated Short Film * The Old Man and the Sea, Winner 1999 Animated Short Film * Dolphins, 2000 Documentary Short Subject Other uses IMAX Filming at Paranal Observatory.

For some legal purposes, this period may be extended to 11 May 1945 to include the end of the Prague Offensive.–§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω ‚Ññ 5-–§–ó –æ—Ç 12 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è 1995, \\"–û –≤–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞—Ö\\" The end of the Great Patriotic War is commemorated on the 9th of May.  History  The term \\"Patriotic War\\" refers to the Russian resistance to the French invasion of Russia under Napoleon I, which became known as the Patriotic War of 1812. In Russian, the term originally referred to a war on one's own territory ( means \\"the fatherland\\"), as opposed to a campaign abroad (),For example, one of the books published shortly after the war was titled —Å 1812 –ø–æ 1815 –≥–æ–¥...\\" (Fyodor Glinka, Moscow, 1815‚Äì1816; the title was translated as \\"Letters of a Russian Officer on Poland, the Austrian Domains, Prussia and France; with a detailed description of the Russian campaign against the French in 1805 and 1806, and also _the Fatherland and foreign war_ from 1812 to 1815...\\" in: A. Herzen, Letters from France and Italy, 1847-1851, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995, p. 272). and later was reinterpreted as a war the fatherland, i.e. a defensive war for one's homeland. Sometimes the Patriotic War of 1812 was also referred to as the Great Patriotic War (); the phrase first appeared in 1844It can be found in Vissarion Belinsky's essay \\"Russian literature in 1843\\" first printed in magazine Otechestvennye Zapiski, vol. 32 (1844), see page 34 of section 5 \\"Critics\\" (each section has its own pagination). and became popular on the eve of the centenary of the Patriotic War of 1812.For example, several books had the phrase in their titles, as: After 1914, the phrase was applied to World War I. It was the name of a special war-time appendix to the magazine Theater and Life () in Saint Petersburg, and referred to the Eastern Front of World War I, where Russia fought against the German Empire and the Austro- Hungarian Empire. The phrases Second Patriotic War () and Great World Patriotic War () were also used during World War I in Russia. The term Great Patriotic War re-appeared in the Soviet newspaper Pravda on 23 June 1941, just a day after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. It was found in the title of \\"The Great Patriotic War of the Soviet People\\" (), a long article by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, a member of Pravda editors' collegium.The dictionary of modern citations and catch phrases, by Konstantin Dushenko, 2006. The phrase was intended to motivate the population to defend the Soviet fatherland and to expel the invader, and a reference to the Patriotic War of 1812 was seen as a great morale booster. The term (Patriotic War or Fatherland War) was officially recognized by establishment of the Order of the Patriotic War on 20 May 1942, awarded for heroic deeds.  Usage  Belarusian veterans of the Great Patriotic War in 2017. The term is not generally used outside the former Soviet Union, and the closest term is Eastern Front of World War II (1941-1945). Neither term covers the initial phase of World War II in Eastern Europe, during which the USSR, then still in a non-aggression pact with Germany, invaded eastern Poland (1939), the Baltic states (1940), Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (1940) and Finland (1939-1940). In Russia and some other post-Soviet countries, the term is given great significance; it is accepted as a representation of the most important part of WWII. Uzbekistan is the only nation in the Commonwealth of Independent States that does not recognize the term, referring to it as World War Two as well as the Victory Day holiday as the Day of Remembrance and Honour.https://www.rferl.org/a/1058790.html On 9 April 2015, the Ukrainian parliament replaced the term \\"Great Patriotic War\\" (Velyka vitchyzniana viina) in the country's law with \\"Second World War\\" (Druha svitova viina),Ukraine Purges Symbols of Its Communist Past, Newsweek, (10 April 2015) as part of a set of decommunization laws. The term is political; accepting it means accepting the Soviet Union's views on WWII, and rejecting the term means breaking away from the Soviet heritage, as in the case of Ukraine.

Family and personal life Isabella Gr√§fin von Zeppelin Ferdinand was the scion of a noble family. Zepelin, the family's eponymous hometown, is a small community outside the town of B√ºtzow in Mecklenburg. Ferdinand von Zeppelin in Virginia, June 1863 Ferdinand was the son of W√ºrttemberg Minister and Hofmarschall Friedrich Jer√¥me Wilhelm Karl Graf von Zeppelin (1807‚Äì1886) and his wife Am√©lie Fran√ßoise Pauline (born Macaire d'Hogguer) (1816‚Äì1852). Ferdinand spent his childhood with his sister and brother at their Girsberg manor near Konstanz, where he was educated by private tutors and lived there until his death. On 7 August 1869 Ferdinand married Isabella Freiin von Wolff in Berlin. She was from the house of Alt-Schwanenburg (present day ‚Äî Gulbene town in Latvia, then part of Livonia). They had a daughter, Helene (Hella) von Zeppelin (1879‚Äì1967) who in 1909 married Alexander Graf von Brandenstein-Zeppelin (1881‚Äì1949). Ferdinand had a nephew Baron Max von Gemmingen who was to later volunteer at the start of World War I, after he was past military age, to become general staff officer assigned to the military airship LZ 12 Sachsen.Lehmann Army career In uniform as adjutant to Charles I of W√ºrttemberg, 1865 Zeppelin in 1900 In 1853 Count Zeppelin left to attend the polytechnic at Stuttgart, and in 1855 he became a cadet of the military school at Ludwigsburg and then started his career as an army officer in the army of W√ºrttemberg. By 1858, Zeppelin had been promoted to lieutenant, and that year he was given leave to study science, engineering and chemistry at T√ºbingen. The Prussians' mobilising for the Austro-Sardinian War interrupted this study in 1859 when he was called up to the ' (Prussian engineering corps) at Ulm. In 1863 Zeppelin took leave to act as an observer for the Union's Army of the Potomac in the American Civil War in Virginia. Later, he travelled to the Upper Midwest with a party that probably included two Russians. Led by Native American (probably Ojibwe) guides, they canoed and portaged from the western end of Lake Superior up the St. Louis River and across to Crow Wing, Minnesota, on the Upper Mississippi River. On reaching St. Paul (via stagecoach and hired carriage), Zeppelin encountered German-born itinerant balloonist John Steiner and made his first aerial ascent with him from a site near the International Hotel in downtown St. Paul on 19 August. Many years later he attributed the beginning of his thinking about dirigible lighter-than-air craft to this experience. In 1865 Zeppelin was appointed adjutant of the King of W√ºrttemberg and as general staff officer participated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He was awarded the Ritterkreuz (Knight's Cross) of the Order of Distinguished Service of W√ºrttemberg. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871 a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, during which he narrowly avoided capture, made him famous among Germans. From 1882 until 1885 Zeppelin was commander of the 19th Uhlans in Ulm, and was then appointed to be the envoy of W√ºrttemberg in Berlin. In 1890 he gave up this post to return to army service, being given command of a Prussian cavalry brigade. His handling of this at the 1890 autumn manoeuvres was severely criticised and he was forced to retire from the Army, albeit with the rank of generalleutnant. Airships Ferdinand von Zeppelin served as an official observer with the Union Army during the American Civil War. During the Peninsular Campaign, he visited the balloon camp of Thaddeus S. C. Lowe shortly after Lowe's services were terminated by the Army. Von Zeppelin then travelled to St. Paul, MN where the German-born former Army balloonist John Steiner offered tethered flights. His first ascent in a balloon, made at Saint Paul, Minnesota during this visit, is said to have been the inspiration of his later interest in aeronautics. Zeppelin's ideas for large airships were first expressed in a diary entry dated 25 March 1874. Inspired by a recent lecture given by Heinrich von Stephan on the subject of \\"World Postal Services and Air Travel\\", he outlined the basic principle of his later craft: a large rigidly- framed outer envelope containing a number of separate gasbags.Robinson 1973 p.13 In 1887 the success of Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs' airship La France prompted him to send a letter to the King of W√ºrttemberg about the military necessity for dirigibles and the lack of German development in this field.Dooley 2004, p.176 After his resignation from the army in 1891 at age 52, Zeppelin devoted his full attention to airships. He hired the engineer Theodor Gross to make tests of possible materials and to assess available engines for both fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio. He also had air propellers tested and strove to obtain higher purity hydrogen gas from suppliers.Dooley 2004, p.177 Zeppelin was so confident of his concept that in June 1891 he wrote to the King of W√ºrttemberg's secretary, announcing he was to start building, and shortly after requested a review from the Prussian Army's Chief of General Staff. The next day Zeppelin almost gave up as he realized he had underestimated air resistance,Dooley 2004, p.178 but resumed work on hearing that Rudolf Hans Bartsch von Sigsfeld made light but powerful engines, information soon shown to be overoptimistic. Whereupon Zeppelin urged his supporter Max von Duttenhofer to press Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft for more efficient engines so as not to fall behind the French.Dooley 2004, p.179 Duttenhofer wrote to Gross threatening to withdraw support, and Zeppelin shortly afterwards sacked Gross, citing Gross' lack of support and writing that he was \\"an obstacle in my path\\". Despite these setbacks Zeppelin's organization had refined his idea: a rigid aluminium framework covered in a fabric envelope; separate multiple internal gas cells, each free to expand and contract thus obviating the need for ballonets; modular frame allowing addition of sections and gas cells; controls, engines and gondola rigidly attached. After publishing the idea in March 1892 he hired the engineer Theodor Kober who started work testing and further refining the design.Dooley 2004, p.181 Zeppelin submitted Kober's 1893 detailed designs to the Prussian Airship Service,Dooley 2004, p.187 whose committee reviewed it in 1894. In June 1895 this committee recommended minimum funds be granted, but withdrew this offer and rejected the design in July.Dooley 2004, p.188 One month later, in August 1895, Zeppelin received a patent for Kober's design, described as an \\"airship-train\\" (' [Steerable airship-train with several carrier structures arranged one behind another].)Dooley 2004, p.190 The patent describes an airship consisting of three rigid sections flexibly connected. The front section, intended to contain the crew and engines, was long with a gas capacity of 9514 cu m (336,000 cu ft): the middle section was long with an intended useful load of and the rear section long with an intended load of Robinson 1973 pp.15-6 In early 1896, Zeppelin's lecture on steerable airship designs given to the Association of German Engineers (VDI) so impressed them that the VDI launched a public appeal for financial support for him. This led to a first contact with Carl Berg who supplied aluminium alloys which Zeppelin had tested, and by May 1898 they, together with Philipp Holzmann, Daimler, Max von Eyth, Carl von Linde, and Friedrich Voith, had formed the joint stock company Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der Luftschiffart. Zeppelin invested 441,000 Marks, over half the total capital.Dooley 2004, pp.193-194 Actual construction then started of what was to be the first successful rigid airship, the Zeppelin LZ1. Berg's involvement with the project would later be the cause of allegations that Zeppelin had used the patent and designs of David Schwarz's airship of 1897. Berg had signed a contract with Schwartz under the terms of which he undertook not to supply aluminium to any other airship manufacturer. He later made a payment to Schwartz's widow as compensation for dissolving this arrangement.Dooley 2004, p.193 Claims that Zeppelin had been influenced by Schwartz were denied by Eckener in 1938Eckener 1938, pp 210‚Äì211. \\"It is obvious at the first glance that the Zeppelin ship had nothing but its aluminium in common with the Schwarz machine, not to mention that Count Zeppelin had fixed the essential features long before Schwarz' ship appeared.\\" and also rejected by later historians. Zeppelin's design was \\"radically different\\"Dooley 2004, p.191 in both its scale and its framework from that of Schwarz. First flight of the LZ 1 On 2 July 1900, Zeppelin made the first flight with the LZ 1 over Lake Constance near Friedrichshafen in southern Germany. The airship rose from the ground and remained in the air for 20 minutes, but was damaged on landing. After repairs and some modifications two further flights were made by LZ 1 in October 1900, However the airship was not considered successful enough to justify investment by the government, and since the experiments had exhausted Count Zeppelins funds, he was forced to suspend his work.Robinson 1973 p.28 Zeppelin still enjoyed the support of the King of W√ºrttemberg, who authorised a state lottery which raised 124,000 marks. A contribution of 50,000 marks was received from Prussia, and Zeppelin raised the remainder of the necessary money by mortgaging his wife's estates. Still supported by Daimler and Carl Berg, construction of his second airship, the LZ 2, was started in April 1905. It was completed by 30 November, when it was first taken out of its hangar, but a ground-handling mishap caused the bows to be pulled into the water, damaging the forward control surfaces. Repairs were completed by 17 January 1906, when LZ 2 made its only flight. Too much ballast was jettisoned on takeoff, causing the airship to rise to an altitude of . Here a stiff breeze was encountered, and although the airship was at first able to overcome this, the failure of the forward engine due to cooling problems followed by the failure of the other due to a broken clutch-spring left the airship at the mercy of the wind. It was brought down near Kisslegg in the Allg√§u mountains, with some damage caused by the stern's striking some trees during mooring, but was more severely damaged by high winds the following night, and had to be dismantled.Robinson 1973 p.30 In May 1906, work as started on a third airship, LZ 3\\\\. This was the same size and configuration as LZ 2, but had a greater gas capacity. Finished by the end of the year, it made two successful flights at a speed of , and in 1907 attained a speed of . The success of LZ 3 produced a change in the official attitude to his work, and the Reichstag voted that he should be awarded 500,000 marks to continue his work.Robinson 1973, p.33 However the purchase by the Government of an airship was made conditional on the successful completion of a 24‚Äëhour trial flight. Knowing that this was beyond the capabilities of LZ 3, work was started on a larger airship, the LZ 4\\\\. This first flew on 20 June 1908. The final financial breakthrough only came after the Zeppelin LZ 4 was destroyed by fire at Echterdingen after breaking free of its moorings during a storm. The airship's earlier flights had excited public interest in the development of the airships, and a subsequent collection campaign raised over 6 million German marks. The money was used to create the 'Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin GmbH' and the Zeppelin foundation (Zeppelin Stiftung).Dooley 2004, p.200 Following the destruction of LZ 4, LZ 3, which had been damaged when the floating hangar broke free of its mooring during a storm, was repaired: at the same time it was lengthened by 8 m. It was re-inflated on 21 October 1908 and after a series of short test flights a flight lasting 5 hours 55 minutes took place on 27 October with the Kaiser's brother, Admiral Prince Heinrich, on board. On 7 November, with Crown Prince William as a passenger, it flew to Donaueschingen, where the Kaiser was then staying. In spite of poor weather conditions, the flight succeeded: two days later LZ 3 was officially accepted by the Government and on 10 November Zeppelin was rewarded with an official visit to Friedrichshafen by the Kaiser, during which a short demonstration flight over Lake Constance was made and Zeppelin awarded the Order of the Black Eagle.Robinson p.43. Although a replacement for LZ 4, the LZ 5 was built and accepted into Army service as L II, Zeppelin's relationship with the military authorities continued to be poor, and deteriorated considerably due to his criticism of the Army following the loss of L II, which was carried away from its moorings and wrecked on 25 April 1910.Robinson 1973, p. 48. However, the business director of Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, Alfred Colsman, came up with a scheme to capitalise on the public enthusiasm for Zeppelin's airships by establishing a passenger- carrying business. Up until 1914 the German Aviation Association (Deutsche Luftschiffahrtsgesellschaft or DELAG) transported 37,250 people on over 1,600 flights without an incident. Lehmann Chapter I \\"All told, 37,250 passengers had been carried, 1,600 flights made, 3,200 hours spent in the air and 90,000 miles flown without accident\\" Within a few years the zeppelin revolution began creating the age of air transportation.

McGarvey, owner of the oil wells of Galicia and his wife, Helena J. Wesolowska. A former Count von Zeppelin married a granddaughter of the 1st Earl of Ranfurly. Legacy Bust of Zeppelin in the Aeronauticum at Nordholz Count Zeppelin died in 1917, before the end of World War I, therefore he did not witness either the provisional shutdown of the Zeppelin project due to the Treaty of Versailles or the second resurgence of the Zeppelins under his successor Hugo Eckener. The unfinished World War II German aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelin, and two rigid airships, the world-circling LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, and LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II, twin to the Hindenburg, were named after him. The name of the British rock group Led Zeppelin derives from his airship as well. His granddaughter Countess Eva von Zeppelin once threatened to sue them for illegal use of their family name while they were performing in Copenhagen.Led Zeppelin - Official Website at ledzeppelin.com A 1974 episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus (Series 4, Episode 1, The Golden Age Of Ballooning) features a skit in which Count Zeppelin (Graham Chapman) has taken various members of the government up in his ship for a promotional flight, only to get angry and throw each guest out of the ship's gondola (while still in the air) over the perceived insult of everyone referring to the craft as a balloon instead of his preferred airship or Zeppelin.

His next novel, Atomised, published in 1998, brought him international fame as well as controversy. Platform followed in 2001. He published several books of poetry, including The Art of Struggle in 1996. An offhand remark about Islam during a publicity tour for his 2001 novel Platform led to Houellebecq being taken to court for inciting racial hatred (he was eventually cleared of all charges). He subsequently moved to Ireland for several years,The Sex Export the Independent on Sunday, 21 August 2005 before moving back to France, where he currently resides. He was described in 2015 as \\"France‚Äôs biggest literary export and, some say, greatest living writer.\\"Angelique Chrisafis. Michel Houellebecq: ‚ÄúAm I Islamophobic?

In 2010, he published The Map and the Territory, which won the prestigious Prix Goncourt. In 2015, his next novel, Submission, sparked another controversy for its depiction of Islam. His latest novel, Serotonin, was published in 2019. Personal Life Houellebecq was born in 1956 on the French island of R√©union, the son of Lucie Ceccaldi, a French doctor born in Algeria of Corsican descent, and Ren√© Thomas, a ski instructor and mountain guide. He lived in Algeria from the age of five months until 1961, with his maternal grandmother. In a lengthy autobiographical article published on his website (now defunct), he states that his parents \\"lost interest in [his] existence pretty quickly\\", and at the age of six, he was sent to France to live with his paternal grandmother, a communist, while his mother left to live a hippie lifestyle in Brazil with her recent boyfriend. His grandmother's maiden name was Houellebecq, which he took as his pen name. Later, he went to Lyc√©e Henri Moissan, a high school at Meaux in the north-east of Paris, as a boarder. He then went to Lyc√©e Chaptal in Paris to follow preparation courses in order to qualify for grandes √©coles (elite schools). He began attending the Institut National Agronomique Paris- Grignon in 1975. He started a literary review called Karamazov (named after Fyodor Dostoevsky's last novel) and wrote poetry. He graduated in 1980, married and had a son; then he divorced, and became depressed. He married his second wife, Marie-Pierre Gauthier, in 1998. They divorced in 2010. His third marriage was in September 2018 to Qianyun Lysis Li, a Chinese woman 34 years his junior, and a student of his works.https://www.france.tv/france-2/complement-d-enquete/1054403-michel- houellebecq-moi-moche-et-mechant.htmlhttps://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/spa- ing-partners/ Works and rise to fame Michel Houellebecq, Warsaw, June 2008 Houellebecq's first poems appeared in 1985 in the magazine La Nouvelle Revue. Six years later, in 1991, he published a biographical essay on the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft, a teenage passion, with the programmatic subtitle Against the World, Against Life. A short poetical essay named Rester vivant : m√©thode (To Stay Alive) appeared the same year, dealing with the art of writing as a way of life ‚Äì or rather, a way of not-dying and being able to write in spite of apathy and disgust for life (a film adaptation was made in 2016). It was followed by his first collection of poetry, La poursuite du bonheur (The pursuit of happiness). Meanwhile, he worked as a computer administrator in Paris, including at the French National Assembly, before he became the so-called \\"pop star of the single generation\\", starting to gain fame in 1994 with his debut novel Extension du domaine de la lutte, published by Maurice Nadeau (translated in English by Paul Hammond and published as Whatever). It reads as a first person narrative, alternating between realistic accounts of the (unnamed) protagonist's bleak and solitary life as a computer programmer, and his idiosyncratic musings about society, some of which are presented in the form of \\"animal fictions\\"; he teams up with an even more desperate colleague (he is virgin at the age of 28) who later gets killed in a car accident, which triggers the narrator's mental breakdown and eventual admission in a psychiatric hospital; even there, he theorizes about his condition being the direct result of the contemporary social configuration, rather than a personal failure or mental illness. Throughout the 1990s, Houellebecq published several books of poetry, including Le sens du combat in 1996 (translated as The Art of Struggle, which, in a 2005 video interview for the magazine Les Inrockuptibles, he cited as his most accomplished book to date, the one he would usually choose if compelled to read whatever he wanted among his published works), and articles in magazines (such as Les Inrockuptibles) or more confidential literary publications (such as L'Infini edited by Philippe Sollers). Most of those texts were later collected in Interventions (1998). At that time, he lived at the same address as fellow writer Marc-√âdouard Nabe, at 103, rue de la Convention in Paris. Nabe wrote about this proximity in Le Vingt-Septi√®me Livre (2006), comparing both neighbours' careers and the way their writings were met by critics and audiences. His second novel, Les Particules √âl√©mentaires (translated by Frank Wynne and published in the English-speaking world as Atomised in the UK, or The Elementary Particles in the USA) was a breakthrough, bringing him national and soon international fame and controversy for its intricate mix of brutally honest social commentary and pornographic depictions (two years earlier, in 1996, while working on that novel, being interviewed by Andrew Hussey, he had presciently said : \\"It will either destroy me or make me famous\\"). It narrates the fate of two half brothers who grew up in the troubled 1960s: Michel Djerzinski, who became a prominent biologist, highly successful as a scientist but utterly withdrawn and depressed, and Bruno Cl√©ment, a French teacher, deeply disturbed and obsessed by sex; Djerzinski eventually triggers what is labeled as the \\"third metaphysical mutation\\" by retro-engineering the human species into immortal neo-humans. The book won the 1998 Prix Novembre (which was renamed Prix D√©cembre, following the resignation of its founder who disapproved of the prize being given to Houellebecq), missing the more prestigious Prix Goncourt for which it was the favorite. The novel became an instant \\"nihilistic classic\\", and was mostly praised for the boldness of its ideas and thought-provoking qualities, although it was also heavily criticized for its relentless bleakness and vivid depictions of racism, paedophilia, torture, as well as for being an apology for eugenics (Michiko Kakutani described it in The New York Times as \\"a deeply repugnant read\\"). The novel won Houellebecq (along with his translator, Frank Wynne) the International Dublin Literary Award in 2002. In 2000, Houellebecq published the short fiction Lanzarote (published in France with a volume of his photographs), in which he explores a number of the themes he would develop in later novels, including sex tourism and fringe religions. His subsequent novel, Plateforme (Platform, 2001), was another critical and commercial success. A first-person romance narrated by a 40-year-old male arts administrator named Michel (who shares many real life characteristics with the author, including his apathy and low self-esteem), it includes a hopeless depiction of life as well as numerous sex scenes, some of which display an approving attitude towards prostitution and sex tourism. The novel's explicit criticism of Islam (the story ends with the depiction of a terrorist attack on a sex tourism venue, later compared to the Bali bombings which happened the following year), together with an interview its author gave to the magazine Lire (in which he described Islam as \\"the dumbest religion\\"), led to accusations of incitement to ethnic or racial hatred against Houellebecq by several organisations, including France's Human Rights League, the Mecca-based World Islamic League as well as the mosques of Paris and Lyon. Charges were brought to trial, but a panel of three judges, delivering their verdict to a packed Paris courtroom, acquitted the author of having provoked 'racial' hatred, ascribing Houellebecq's opinions to the legitimate right of criticizing religions. The huge controversy in the media subsided following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. His next novel, La Possibilit√© d'une √Æle (The Possibility of an Island, 2005), cycles between three characters' narratives: Daniel 1, a contemporary stand-up comedian and movie maker renowned for his extreme causticity, alternating with Daniel 24 and then Daniel 25, neo-human clones of Daniel 1 in a far future; Daniel 1 witnesses dramatic events by which a sect named the Elohimites (based on Ra√´lism) changes the course of history, and his autobiography constitutes a canonical account that his clones are compelled to study, both in order to acquaint themselves with their model / ancestor's troubled character (since the Elohimites' chief scientist's purported project of mind uploading turned out to be a failure) and to distance themselves from the flaws of humans. Houellebecq later adapted and directed a movie based on this novel, which was a critical and commercial failure. In 2008, Flammarion published Ennemis publics (Public Enemies), a conversation via e-mail between Michel Houellebecq and Bernard-Henri L√©vy, in which both reflected on their controversial reception by the mainstream media, and elaborated on their tastes and influences in literature, among other topics. Houellebecq has also released three music albums on which he recites or sings selected excerpts from his poetry. Two of them were recorded with composer Jean-Jacques Birg√©: Le sens du combat (1996, Radio France) and √âtablissement d'un ciel d'alternance (2007, Grrr Records, which Houellebecq considers the best of his recording endeavours, as handwritten in the libretto). Pr√©sence humaine (released in 2000 on Bertrand Burgalat's Tricatel label, and featuring musical arrangements by Burgalat himself), has a rock band backing him, and has been compared to the works of Serge Gainsbourg in the 1970s; it was re-released in 2016 with two additional tracks arranged by Jean-Claude Vannier (who famously worked on Histoire de Melody Nelson) and a booklet featuring notes by Mishka Assayas and texts by Fernando Arrabal. A recurrent theme in Houellebecq's novels is the intrusion of free-market economics into human relationships and sexuality. The original French title of Whatever, Extension du domaine de la lutte (literally \\"broadening of the field of struggle\\"), alludes to economic competition extending into the search for relationships. As the book says, a free market has absolute winners and absolute losers, and the same applies to relationships in a society that does not value monogamy but rather exhorts people to seek the happiness that always eludes them through the path of sexual consumerism, in pursuit of narcissistic satisfaction. Similarly, Platform carries to its logical conclusion the touristic phenomenon, where Westerners of both sexes go on organized trips to developing countries in search of exotic locations and climates. In the novel, a similar popular demand arises for sex tourism, organized and sold in a corporate and professional fashion. Sex tourists are willing to sacrifice financially to experience the instinctual expression of sexuality, which has been better preserved in poor countries whose people are focused on the struggle for survival. Although Houellebecq's work is often credited with building on conservative, if not reactionary, ideas, his critical depiction of the hippie movement, New Age ideology and the May 1968 generation, especially in Atomised, echoes the thesis of Marxist sociologist Michel Clouscard. His novel La Carte et le Territoire (The Map and the Territory) was released in September 2010 by Flammarion and finally won its author the prestigious Prix Goncourt. This is the tale of an accidental art star and is full of insights on the contemporary art scene. Slate magazine accused him of plagiarising some passages of this book from French Wikipedia.Davies, Lizzy (8 September 2010). \\"Houellebecq fights off claims of plagiarism in new novel\\". The Guardian, Main section, p. 16. Published online (7 September 2010) as \\"Michel Houellebecq novel ruffles literary world again\\" . Retrieved 15 September 2010. Houellebecq denied the accusation of plagiarism, stating that \\"taking passages word for word was not stealing so long as the motives were to recycle them for artistic purposes\\", evoking the influence of Georges Perec, Lautreamont or Jorge Luis Borges, and advocated the use of all sorts of raw materials in literature, including advertising, recipes or mathematics problems. On 7 January 2015, the date of the Charlie Hebdo shooting, the novel Submission was published. The book describes a future situation in France, set in 2022, when a Muslim party, following a victory against the National Front, is ruling the country according to Islamic law, which again generated heated controversy and accusations of Islamophobia. On the same date, a cartoon of Houellebecq appeared on the cover page of Charlie Hebdo with the caption \\"The Predictions of Wizard Houellebecq,\\" eerily ironic in retrospect. For the second time, his fictional work appeared to echo real events involving Islamic terrorism (although Submission does not feature acts of terrorism and eventually presents conversion to Islam as an attractive choice for the protagonist, a typically \\"houellebecquian\\" middle-aged man with a fixation for young women). A friend of his, Bernard Maris, was killed in that shooting. In an interview with Antoine de Caunes after the shooting, Houellebecq stated he was unwell and had cancelled the promotional tour for Submission. In January 2019, Houellebecq was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. His novel S√©rotonine was published (translated as Serotonin) in the same month. This time, one of the novel's main themes, a violent revolt from desperate farmers, appeared to echo the Yellow Vests movement.  Adaptations  Extension du domaine de la lutte has been adapted into a film with the same title by Philippe Harel, and later adapted as a play in Danish by Jens Albinus for the Royal Danish Theatre. The English translation of his novel Platform was adapted as a play by the theatre company Carnal Acts for the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London in December 2004. A Spanish adaptation of the novel by Calixto Bieito, performed by Companyia Teatre Romea, premiered at the 2006 Edinburgh International Festival. Houellebecq and Bieito appeared together that same year in a TV program named Au c≈ìur de la nuit / Durch die Nacht (Through the night) for the French-German channel Arte. Along with Loo Hui Phang, Houellebecq wrote the screenplay for the film Monde ext√©rieur (2002) by David Rault and David Warren. Atomised has been made into a German film, Elementarteilchen, directed by Oskar Roehler, starring Moritz Bleibtreu and Franka Potente. The film premiered in 2006 at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival. It was poorly received and generally considered as watered-down take on the novel's bleakness and thought-provoking ideas. The film La Possibilit√© d'une √Æle, directed by Houellebecq himself and based on his novel, premiered in France on 10 September 2008. It was a critical and commercial failure, sometimes even considered as one of the worst films ever made in France, alongside Bernard Henri Levy's Le Jour et la Nuit, although some authors found him intriguing and recognized redeeming qualities. American rock singer and \\"godfather of punk\\" Iggy Pop released in 2009 the unusually quiet album Pr√©liminaires, which he described as influenced by his reading of Michel Houellebecq's novel The Possibility of an Island (one track 'A Machine for Loving' even consists in the singer merely reading a passage from the book over a musical accompaniment.). The author considered it a great honour, as he was himself deeply affected as a teenager by Iggy Pop's music with The Stooges, even going so far as to say that he was, for once, \\"completely happy\\". In 2016 he participated, together with Iggy Pop and several others, in Erik Lieshout's documentary To Stay Alive: A Method, based on his 1991 essay. Views on politics and religion In 2014, Houellebecq drew up a \\"project for a new constitution\\" based on direct democracy which would render the president of the republic elected for life, but instantly revocable by a simple popular referendum, and would permit the people to elect judges. During his 21 June 2016 appearance on Le Petit Journal, Houellebecq said that he voted for the Socialist Party ticket headed by Anne Hidalgo and J√©r√¥me Coumet in the 2014 Paris municipal election. In 2017 Houellebecq explained that he \\"doesn't believe in an ideological vote, but a vote based on class\\" and that \\"there is a class which votes for Le Pen, a class which votes for M√©lenchon, a class which votes for Macron, and a class which votes for Fillon. I am part of the France which votes for Macron, because I am too rich to vote for Le Pen or M√©lenchon.\\" Houellebecq has been accused of putting on polemical stunts for the media. In particular, the author's statements in interviews and from his novels have led to accusations of his being anti-Islamic. In 2002, during an interview about his book Platform published in the literary magazine Lire, Houellebecq remarked: > Islam is a dangerous religion, and has been from the moment it appeared. > Fortunately, it is doomed. On one hand, because God does not exist, and even > if someone is an idiot, he will eventually realize that. In the long run, > the truth will triumph. On the other hand, Islam is undermined from the > inside by capitalism. We can only hope that it will triumph rapidly. > Materialism is a lesser evil. Its values are contemptible, but nevertheless > less destructive, less cruel than those of Islam. He faced trial on charges of racial hatred after calling Islam \\"the dumbest religion\\" (\\"la religion la plus con\\") in the same interview. He told a court in Paris that his words had been twisted, saying: \\"I have never displayed the least contempt for Muslims [but] I have as much contempt as ever for Islam\\". The court acquitted him.The Australian (10 August 2010) 'Has Mad, Bad Michel Houellebecq Come in From The Cold?' Arts Section ] He was sued by a civil- rights group for hate speech and won on the grounds of freedom of expression. Houellebecq extended his critique to monotheistic religions in general: > The fundamental monotheistic texts preach neither peace nor love nor > tolerance. From the start, they were texts of hatred. Criticisms Literary critics have labeled Michel Houellebecq's novels \\"vulgar\\", \\"pamphlet literature\\" and \\"pornography\\"; he has been accused of obscenity, racism, misogyny and Islamophobia. His works, particularly Atomised, have received high praise from the French literary intelligentsia, with generally positive international critical response, though there have been notably poor reviews in The New York Times by Michiko Kakutani and Anthony Quinn, in the London Review of Books by Perry Anderson,Perry Anderson, D√©gringolade , London Review of Books, September 2004. as well as mixed reviews from The Wall Street Journal. However, without ignoring the book's grotesqueries, Lorin Stein from Salon, later editor of The Paris Review, made a spirited defense: Ten years later, Houllebecq responded to critical reviews: Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi has criticised Houellebecq's stance on Lovecraft.\\"Why Michel Houellebecq is Wrong About Lovecraft's Racism\\". Lovecraft Annual (2018) NY: Hippocampus Press An essay by Todd Spaulding makes the case for why Houellebecq portrayed Lovecraft as an 'obsolete reactionary' whose work was based largely on 'racial hatred.'Todd Spaulding, \\"Lovecraft and Houllebecq: Two Against the World\\", Lovecraft Annual No 9 (2015):182-213.

Pears' Soap launched the original Pears' Shilling Cyclopaedia in December 1897, the year of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The first edition contained an English dictionary, a medical dictionary, a gazetteer and atlas, desk information and a compendium of general knowledge entitled \\"A Mass of Curious and Useful Information and Things that everyone ought to know in Commerce, History, Science, Religion, Literature and the other Topics of Ordinary Conversation\\". Each edition traditionally featured an atlas, a gazetteer, a chronological list of events, a list of prominent people (past and present), a miniature encyclopaedia of general information and around a dozen or more other sections on various subjects such as cinema, classical mythology, current events, wine, astronomy, ideas and beliefs, gardening, medicine, etc. The selection of subjects varied slightly over the years, and in later years the world atlas section was dropped, leaving a world and European map inside the front and rear covers and with the Gazetteer limited to the British Isles. From 1953 it was published annually. It was published by Pelham Books from 1959 to 1988, and from then until the final, 2017 edition by Penguin Books. Dr. Chris Cook was the editor from 1977 until the final edition. During the 1950s, Pears' awarded the Silver Pears' Trophy annually to a prominent person for \\"outstanding British achievement in any field.\\" Pears' Cyclopaedia, The Final Edition The 2017‚Äì2018 edition, released on 31 August 2017, is subtitled \\"THE FINAL EDITION\\". The publisher confirmed it is the last: \\"In the age of the internet, Pears' has continued to be a uniquely British almanac, reaching readers across generations. It is with great sadness that we stop publishing it as Dr. Cook retires but we celebrate his dedication and generosity over the past four decades.\\" According to The Bookseller, \\"Statistics from Nielsen BookScan have also revealed volume sales of the work have sharply declined in recent years: the 2001/02 edition sold 24,229 copies whereas the 2016/17 edition sold only 2,854.\\" Over its history, Pears' had \\"produced sales over 3 million copies by the 1930s and at least as many since\\" . The Guardian's article on the final edition cites total sales over the last decade (2007‚Äì2017) of \\"more than 120,000\\", adding that, \\"according to Penguin, it did particularly well in election years\\". Sam Leith writes in The Times Literary Supplement: \\"Now, rendered quite redundant in that respect by Wikipedia (among many, many other things), Pears‚Äô is more a curiosity than a serious reference resource.\\" But he continues: \\"You‚Äôre more likely, as I did, to open this Cyclopaedia to see whether something‚Äôs in it than in the hopes of finding out about that something. Which said, on that level it is full of interest. To the very great credit of Dr. Chris Cook, who has been annually (and manually) updating the Cyclopaedia since 1977, it has done a semi- successful job of its madly quixotic project of keeping up with the times.\\" The final page of the final edition summarizes \\"The Story of Pears, 1897‚Äì2017\\" and concludes: \\"The single most important factor in the Pears success story, and the key to its truly unique publishing phenomenon, is that it is [was] the only book of its kind to be fully revised and updated by a team of experts every year. Schools and colleges, offices and libraries, students and researchers, newspapers, radio and TV stations ‚Äì for all these and many more, for whom readily accessible, reliable facts at their fingertips are needed, Pears' Cyclopaedia remained an invaluable companion. Now, the ready availability of electronic information has made the printed reference work no longer commercially competitive. That is progress. But many will regret the passing of a famous book that, in its heyday, had become not only a national institution but also the reliable pathway for successive generations of working-class families to a better education.\\" References  External links  favorite texts Pears' shilling cyclop√¶dia 1898 ed.

In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. Waters initially served solely as the bassist, but following the departure of singer-songwriter Syd Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist, co-lead vocalist, and conceptual leader. Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute over the use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987. Waters' solo work includes the studio albums The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984), Radio K.A.O.S. (1987), Amused to Death (1992), and Is This the Life We Really Want? (2017). In 2005, he released ', an opera translated from √âtienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto about the French Revolution. In 1990, Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin, with an attendance of 450,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Nick Mason, Richard Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event, the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999; he performed The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006‚Äì2008, and the Wall Live tour of 2010‚Äì13 was the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist at the time. Early years Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (n√©e Whyte; 1913‚Äì2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914‚Äì1944), in Great Bookham, Surrey. His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. In the early years of the Second World War, Waters' father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz. Waters' father later changed his stance on pacifism, joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia, during the Battle of Anzio, when Roger was five months old. He is commemorated in Aprilia and at the Cassino War Cemetery. On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. Waters' earliest memory is of the V-J Day celebrations. Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College) with Syd Barrett, while future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour lived nearby on Mill Road and attended the Perse School. At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND), having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation. He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams. Waters was unhappy at school, saying: \\"I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one ... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers.\\" Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) school of architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well suited to that field. He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering. 1965‚Äì1985: Pink Floyd =Formation and Barrett-led period= Waters performing with Pink Floyd at alt=A monochrome image of Roger Waters playing bass guitar. He has shoulder-length hair, black attire, and is standing in front of a microphone. By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic.: (secondary source); : (primary source). Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe.: (secondary source); : (primary source). They usually called themselves Sigma 6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided occasional vocals. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic. When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and guitarist Bob Klose to join.: (primary source); : (secondary source). Waters switched to the bass and by January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. In late 1965, the Tea Set had changed their name to the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and, by early 1966, Pink Floyd.: (primary source); : (secondary source). By early 1966, Barrett was Pink Floyd's frontman, guitarist, and songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, released in August 1967. Waters contributed the song \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" (his first sole writing credit) to the album. By late 1967, Barrett's deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour, rendered him \\"unable or unwilling\\" to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd's singer- songwriter and lead guitarist. In early March 1968, to discuss the band's future, Barrett, Mason, Waters, and Wright met with the band's managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King of the rock music management company they had all founded: Blackhill Enterprises. Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band \\"agreed to Blackhill's entitlement in perpetuity\\" regarding \\"past activities\\". The band's new manager Steve O'Rourke made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of David Gilmour in April 1968. =Waters-led period= A live performance of The Dark Side of the Moon at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, shortly after its release in 1973: (l‚Äìr) David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Dick Parry, Roger Waters Filling the void left by Barrett's departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became a dominant songwriter and the band's principal lyricist, sharing lead vocals with Gilmour and sometimes Wright, and throughout the latter half of the 1970s, would become the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote most of the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his departure, starting with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album from The Dark Side of the Moon onwards has been a concept album. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, The Dark Side of the Moon was one of the most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart‚Äîuntil July 1988‚Äîand sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark Side of the Moon is the world's second best-selling album and the United States' 21st-bestselling album. In 1970 Waters composed Music from The Body in collaboration with Ron Geesin, a soundtrack album to Roy Battersby's documentary film The Body. Waters produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for the Pink Floyd concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979)‚Äîwritten largely by Waters‚Äîand The Final Cut (1983)‚Äîwritten entirely by Waters. He referred or alluded to the cost of war and the loss of his father throughout his work, from \\"Corporal Clegg\\" (A Saucerful of Secrets, 1968) and \\"Free Four\\" (Obscured by Clouds, 1972) to \\"Us and Them\\" from The Dark Side of the Moon, \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\", first used in the feature film, The Wall (1982), later included with \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" on The Final Cut, an album dedicated to his father. The theme and composition of The Wall was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War. The double album The Wall was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on his life story. Having sold over 23 million RIAA certified units in the US as of 2013, is one of the top three best-selling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA. Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the sleeve art. The band embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of The Wall was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later. In March 1983, the last Waters‚ÄìGilmour‚ÄìMason collaboration, The Final Cut, was released. The album was subtitled: \\"A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd\\". Waters wrote all the album's lyrics and music. His lyrics were critical of the Conservative Party government of the day and mention Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by name. At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name \\"disappeared\\" from the production credits, though he retained his pay. Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder describing it as \\"a superlative achievement\\" and \\"art rock's crowning masterpiece\\".: \\"art rock's crowning masterpiece\\"; : \\"a superlative achievement\\". Loder viewed the work as \\"essentially a Roger Waters solo album\\". =Departure and lawsuit= Amidst creative differences, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the band regarding their continued use of the name and material. In December 1985, Waters issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the \\"Leaving Member\\" clause in his contract. In October 1986, he initiated High Court proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a \\"spent force creatively\\". Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters claims to have been forced to resign like Wright had been years earlier, and decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, saying: \\"If I hadn't, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely.\\" In December 1987, Waters and Pink Floyd reached an agreement. Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to the Wall concept and the inflatable Animals pig. Pink Floyd released three studio albums without him: A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), The Division Bell (1994) and The Endless River (2014). In 2005, Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: \\"I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity.\\" In 2013, he said he regretted the lawsuit, saying: 1984‚Äìpresent: solo career = 1984‚Äì1989: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking and Radio K.A.O.S. = Waters performing The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin, Germany, on 21 July 1990 The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin, 21 July 1990 In 1984, Waters released his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, which dealt with Waters' feelings about monogamy and family life versus \\"the call of the wild\\". The protagonist, Reg, finally chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist Eric Clapton, jazz saxophonist David Sanborn, and artwork by Gerald Scarfe. Kurt Loder described The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking as a \\"strangely static, faintly hideous record\\". Rolling Stone rated the album a \\"rock bottom one star\\". Years later, Mike DeGagne of AllMusic praised its \\"ingenious symbolism\\" and \\"brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm\\", rating it four out of five stars. Waters toured the album with Clapton, a new band, and new material; the shows included a selection of Pink Floyd songs. Waters d√©buted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. The tour drew poor ticket sales and some performances at larger venues were cancelled; Waters estimated that he lost ¬£400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff‚ÄîNorth America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA. In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated film When the Wind Blows, based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name. His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band. In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S., a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987. = 1989‚Äì1999: The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin and Amused to Death = In November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest and most elaborate rock concerts in history, The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin, on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. The show reported an official attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers. Leonard Cheshire asked him to do the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters' group of musicians included Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Scorpions, and Sin√©ad O'Connor. Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the US 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25 metres tall and 170 metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not. Waters released a live double-album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA. In 1990, Waters hired manager Mark Fenwick and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, Amused to Death, in 1992. The record is heavily influenced by the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the Gulf War, and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman. Patrick Leonard, who worked on A Momentary Lapse of Reason, co-produced the album. Jeff Beck played lead guitar on many of the album's tracks, which were recorded with a cast of musicians at ten different recording studios. It is Waters' most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering comparison to his work with Pink Floyd. Waters described the record as, a \\"stunning piece of work\\", ranking the album with Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall as one of the best of his career. The album had one hit, the song \\"What God Wants, Pt. 1\\", which reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US. Amused to Death was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry. Sales of Amused to Death topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his In the Flesh tour. In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK Rock and Roll Halls of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. =1999‚Äì2004: In the Flesh tour and Wall Broadway production= In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US; though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones. The tour eventually stretched across the world and spanned three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, In the Flesh ‚Äì Live. During the tour, Waters played two new songs \\"Flickering Flame\\" and \\"Each Small Candle\\" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue. Miramax announced in 2004 that a production of The Wall was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from The Wall, but also songs from Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material. On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its overture, were played on the occasion of the Welcome Europe celebrations in the accession country of Malta. Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over Grand Harbour in Valletta. In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks online: \\"To Kill the Child\\", inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and \\"Leaving Beirut\\", an anti- war song inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager. = 2005‚Äì2015: Pink Floyd reunion, ', and further touring = alt=A concert stage lit by purple lighting.

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for their final performance together at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of The Wall at Earls Court London 24 years earlier. They played a 23-minute set consisting of \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\"/\\"Breathe (Reprise)\\", \\"Money\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". Waters told the Associated Press that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be \\"slight\\" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences. Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he \\"agreed to roll over for one night only\\". In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who. In September 2005, Waters released ' (pronounced , French for \\"it will be fine\\"; Waters added the subtitle, \\"There is Hope\\"), an opera in three acts translated from the late √âtienne Roda-Gil's French libretto based on the historical subject of the French Revolution. ' was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang and tenor Paul Groves. Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989, and said about the composition: \\"I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, Berlioz and Borodin ... This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music.\\" Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused instead on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would \\"take in stride\\", a sign Pink Floyd biographer Mark Blake believes is \\"a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy\\". ' reached number 5 on the Billboard Classical Music Chart in the United States. In June 2006, Waters commenced The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, a two-year, world-spanning effort that began in Europe in June and North America in September. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters' solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon, the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of The Wall. He used elaborate staging by concert lighting designer Marc Brickman complete with laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a \\"handler\\" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree quadraphonic sound system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for The Dark Side of the Moon set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates. Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June. In March 2007, the Waters song \\"Hello (I Love You)\\" was featured in the science fiction film The Last Mimzy. The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as \\"a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day\\". He performed at California's Coachella Festival in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists performing at Live Earth 2008 in Mumbai, India in December 2008, but the concert was cancelled in light of the 26 November terrorist attacks in Mumbai. In April 2008, Waters discussed a possible new album with the tentative name Heartland. =2010‚Äìpresent: The Wall Live and Is This the Life We Really Want? = Waters in Barcelona during The Wall Live in 2011In June 2010, he released a cover of \\"We Shall Overcome\\", a protest song rewritten and arranged by Guy Carawan and Pete Seeger. He performed with Gilmour at the Hoping Foundation Benefit Evening in July 2010. The set comprised a cover of the Phil Spector song \\"To Know Him Is to Love Him\\", which was played in early Pink Floyd soundchecks, followed by \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", and \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part Two)\\". In September 2010, Waters commenced the Wall Live tour, an updated version of the original Pink Floyd shows, featuring a complete performance of The Wall. Waters told the Associated Press that the tour would likely be his last, stating: \\"I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters. I'm not a great vocalist or a great instrumentalist or whatever, but I still have the fire in my belly, and I have something to say. I have a swan song in me and I think this will probably be it.\\" At The O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason once again appeared with Waters and Gilmour performing \\"Comfortably Numb\\", and Gilmour and Mason joining Waters for \\"Outside the Wall\\". For the first half of 2012, Waters' tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally.\\"Roger Waters tops worldwide ticket sales for 2012\\". BBC News. Retrieved 14 July 2012 By 2013, The Wall Live had become the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist up to that date. Waters performed at the Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. On 24 July 2015, Waters headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island.

The tour title is derived from the track \\"Us and Them,\\" from The Dark Side of the Moon. Waters released his first solo album in nearly 25 years, Is This the Life We Really Want?, on 2 June 2017. It was produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich; Godrich was critical of Waters' earlier solo work, and encouraged him to make a concise album showcasing his lyrics. The album was promoted with the Us + Them Tour. In 2018, Waters narrated an adaptation of Igor Stravinsky's theatrical work The Soldier's Tale recorded with the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival. It was released on 26 October via Sony Classical Masterworks. On 18 April 2019, Waters joined Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets on stage at the Beacon Theatre to sing the lead vocals on \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\". In 2019, Pollstar named Waters as one of the top ten grossing concert acts of the decade.  Personal life  In 1969, Waters married his childhood sweetheart Judith Trim, a successful potter; she was featured on the gatefold sleeve of the original release of Ummagumma, but excised from subsequent CD reissues. They had no children and divorced in 1975. Trim died in 2001. In 1976, Waters married Lady Carolyne Christie, the niece of the 3rd Marquess of Zetland.

Waters is an atheist.Roger Waters ‚Äì Freedom From Religion FoundationRoger Waters Weighs In On Politics, Religion, & Money  On The Table Ep. 5 Full  Reserve Channel Activism =Israel and Palestine= Waters first saw the Israeli West Bank barrier in 2006, at the request of Palestinian supporters, when he was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv. After viewing the barrier, he moved his Tel Aviv concert to Neve Shalom, because he believed his presence in Tel Aviv would \\"inadvertently legitimise the oppression [he] had seen\\". He described the barrier as \\"an appalling edifice to behold\\" which had turned Gaza into a \\"virtual prison\\". This experience convinced him that a cultural boycott of Israel was needed. He has spoken out against the West Bank barrier since then and in 2011 said: In December 2009, Waters pledged his support to the Gaza Freedom March. In 2011, he announced that he had joined the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and called on Israel to end the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, remove the West Bank barrier, grant full equality and rights to Arab citizens of Israel and allow all Palestinian refugees to return to their homes. In a December 2013 interview with CounterPunch, Waters said that he is part of the BDS movement because he believed it was wrong \\"for an artist to go and play in a country that occupies other people‚Äôs land and oppresses them the way Israel does\\". He said that many people pretended that the oppression of the Jews was not going on in the period 1933 to 1946. \\"So this is not a new scenario. Except that this time it‚Äôs the Palestinian People being murdered\\". Abraham Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League, accused Waters of antisemitism for comparing the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust. In 2013, rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, accused Waters of antisemitism for including a giant pig balloon with a Star of David on its back at one of his concerts. In response, Waters said: \\"I will continue my non-violent protests as long as the government of Israel continues with these policies. ... It is difficult to make arguments to defend the Israeli government's policies, so would-be defenders often use a diversionary tactic, they routinely drag the critic into a public arena and accuse them of being an antisemite\\". The Anti-Defamation League initially said that it believed Waters had no antisemitic intent in using the balloon and star as he had a long history of using the symbols. However, the League later concluded that Waters was indeed an anti-Semite after his \\"relentless attacks against Israel and calls for a boycott of the Jewish State\\", as said by the League in an open letter to the songwriter. The League's director, Abraham Foxman, told the Times of Israel that anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have ‚Äúseeped into the totality‚Äù of the songwriter's views. On 2 October 2015, Waters published an open letter in Salon criticising Bon Jovi for performing in Tel Aviv, which led radio host Howard Stern to criticise Waters on his show. Waters also joined more than 50 prominent figures urging Radiohead to cancel a 2017 Tel Aviv performance. In October 2017, Waters was one of the signatories to an open letter addressed to Nick Cave asking him to cancel his scheduled concerts in Tel Aviv. In October 2016, Waters lost $4 million in sponsorship after American Express refused to fund his North America tour due to his ‚Äúanti- Israel rhetoric‚Äù at a previous festival. In November 2016, Citibank joined American Express in cutting ties to Waters. Waters narrated the 2016 documentary The Occupation of the American Mind: Israel‚Äôs Public Relations War in the United States about the methods used by Israel to shape American public opinion. In June 2017, an organisation known as We Don't Need No Roger Waters started to boycott Waters for his support of BDS. Waters' concerts in Germany have been boycotted by Germany's organisation of public broadcasters ARD. Waters took part in a panel discussion entitled \\"Israel, Free Speech, and the Battle for Palestinian Human Rights\\" at the University of Massachusetts Amherst on 4 May 2019. A group of students sought to stop the discussion through the courts on the grounds that it was antisemitic and they would \\"suffer irreparable harm\\" but a Superior Court judge ruled that the event could go ahead. Waters welcomed the court action as a way of publicising the Palestinian cause and said \\"criticism of the Israeli government‚Äôs flouting of international law and abuses of human rights has nothing to do with the Jewish faith or Jewish people\\". In February 2020, following the showing of advertisements for his This Is Not a Drill concert series on some Major League Baseball platforms, Jewish organisation B'nai B'rith criticised the league's decision to show the ads and sponsor the tour. The organisation wrote a letter to commissioner Rob Manfred in which it stated that Waters‚Äô views on Israel \\"far exceed the boundaries of civil discourse\\". Following the criticism, the league decided to stop running ads for Water's tour on its platforms. On 20 June 2020, during an interview with Shehab News Agency, Waters described American business magnate Sheldon Adelson as a \\"puppet master pulling the strings of Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo, and ... the Ambassador [to Israel]\\", and called Zionism an \\"ugly stain\\" that \\"needs to be gently removed\\". He said Israel was indirectly responsible for the killing of George Floyd, an American man killed by a police officer, as the \\"Israeli Defense Forces invented the restriction technique of kneeling on necks\\". Waters was accused by several publications of making antisemitic comments. On 25 June, Waters issued an apology, expressing regret for using \\"words that evoked metaphorical imagery which (...) were 'harmful to Jewish people and to the movement for Palestinian rights\\". He said that his claim that Israel had introduced the kneeling-on- neck technique to American police was wrong. =Other activism= After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster, Waters performed \\"Wish You Were Here\\" with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network NBC. Waters was outspoken against the Hunting Act of 2004, and performed a concert for, and attended marches supporting, the Countryside Alliance. Waters explained that whether he supported hunting or not, it was important to defend it as a right. He left the UK soon afterwards. He clarified in October 2005 that he had not left the country in protest against the hunting legislation but for family reasons, and that he often returned to the UK. The Wall Live in Kansas City, 30 October 2010 alt=In this scene, Waters punches the wall, while the projections simulate the wall crumbling as a result, revealing a bright sunset behind After leaving Britain, Waters moved to Long Island in New York with his fianc√© Laurie Durning. In June 2007, he became a spokesman for Millennium Promise, a non-profit organisation fighting poverty and malaria, and wrote an opinion piece for CNN in support of the topic. In July, he participated in the American leg of the Live Earth concert, an international multi-venue concert aimed at raising awareness about global climate change, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademarked inflatable pig. Waters told David Fricke why he thinks The Wall is still relevant today: Water is supportive of veterans, which he partly attributes to the death of his father in the second world war. He allocates a block of tickets for veterans at each of his shows. For a few years he performed with a group of wounded veterans that was arranged through the United States National Military Medical Center. In 2012, Waters led a benefit for United States military veterans called Stand Up for Heroes. He invited a music group of combat-wounded veterans called MusiCorps to perform with him. In June 2013, Waters and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning. Waters performing in Gda≈Ñsk in August 2018 during the Us + Them Tour, criticising the Polish government's treatment of the courts and media. Waters is an opponent of Brexit (the UK leaving the European Union). Following the June 2016 referendum which saw the British public vote to leave the EU, he said: \\"If I had voted, I would have voted obviously to stay in the European Union ... I thought we were better than that. I was wrong.\\" Waters has criticised US president Donald Trump and his policies. In 2017, Waters condemned Trump's plan to build a wall separating the US and Mexico, saying that the Pink Floyd album The Wall was \\"very relevant now with Mr. Trump and all of this talk of building walls and creating as much enmity as possible between races and religions\\". Following the Douma chemical attack in Syria in April 2018, Waters described the White Helmets volunteer group that had first reported the attack as a \\"fake organisation\\" that created propaganda for \\"jihadists and terrorists\\". Jonathan Freedland in The Guardian wrote: \\"That claim, which has been repeatedly debunked, was instantly applauded and spread by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad‚Äôs online cheerleaders.\\" In October 2018, Waters drew praise and criticism when he included Brazilian far-right then- presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro in a list of \\"neo-fascists\\" displayed on a big screen at his concert in S√£o Paulo. In a concert in Rio de Janeiro later in October, Waters paid homage to murdered Brazilian councilwoman Marielle Franco and brought her daughter, sister and widow on stage during his performance. In February 2019, Waters used his Twitter account to publicise an \\"emergency demonstration\\" at the US Mission to the United Nations in New York against US interference in Venezuela. He also alleged that the US was trying to destroy Venezuelan democracy so that \\"the 1% can plunder their oil\\". Twitter users, including the Venezuelan band La Vida Boh√®me, criticised him for supporting the Venezuelan government amid the presidential crisis, and claiming that Venezuela enjoyed \\"true democracy\\". Waters was critical of Richard Branson for organising the Venezuela Live Aid concert saying \\"it has nothing to do with the needs of the Venezuelan people, it has nothing to do with democracy, it has nothing to do with freedom, and it has nothing to do with aid\\". On 2 September 2019, Waters spoke at a rally outside London's Home Office calling for the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and dedicated a performance of \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to him. On 22 February 2020, Waters spoke at a rally in support of Assange outside parliament in London. Waters is a supporter of Steven Donziger, an American lawyer embroiled in environmental litigation against Chevron corporation who has been described by 29 Nobel laureates as a victim of judicial harassment. In November 2019, along with other public figures, Waters signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \\"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \\"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\\" In February 2020, Waters participated in a protest in London against the extradition of Julian Assange. While introducing the Indian poet and activist Aamir Aziz from the Jamia Milllia Islamia at the rally, Waters referred to the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, describing it as \\"fascist\\" and \\"racist\\". Equipment and instruments Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar. He briefly played a H√∂fner bass but replaced it with a Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S, until 1970 when it was stolen along with the rest of the band's equipment in New Orleans. He began using Fender Precision Basses in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar. On 2 October 2010, it became the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model. Waters endorses RotoSound Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings. Throughout his career he has used Selmer, WEM, Hiwatt and Ashdown amplifiers but has used Ampeg for the last few tours. He has employed delay, tremolo, chorus, stereo panning and phaser effects in his bass playing. Waters experimented with the EMS Synthi A and VCS 3 synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as \\"On the Run\\", \\"Welcome to the Machine\\", and \\"In the Flesh?\\" He played electric and acoustic guitar on Pink Floyd tracks using Fender, Martin, Ovation and Washburn guitars. He played electric guitar on the Pink Floyd song \\"Sheep\\", from Animals, and acoustic guitar on several Pink Floyd recordings, such as \\"Pigs on the Wing 1 & 2\\", also from Animals, \\"Southampton Dock\\" from The Final Cut, and on \\"Mother\\" from The Wall. A Binson Echorec 2 echo effect was used on his bass lead track \\"One of These Days\\". Waters plays trumpet during concert performances of \\"Outside the Wall\\".

The term Freedonia was later popularized by the 1933 Marx Brothers movie Duck Soup. Over time, however, the word has come to have a more generic meaning. It can be anything from a noun describing a plausible yet fictional country, to an adjective (\\"Freedonian\\") used to characterize a place like the Freedonia of Duck Soup. Because the Marx Brothers' Freedonia had so many qualities‚Äîautocracy, diminutiveness, and obscurity, to name but a few‚Äîa place can be described as \\"Freedonian\\" for having any one of these qualities.  Usage  = 1800s =  As a name for the United States  Dr Samuel Mitchill suggested that 'Fredonian' be used by citizens of the United States (\\"Fredon\\") after the American Revolution in place of the demonym \\"American\\", which was then being used as a pejorative term by the metropolitan English to refer to \\"their inferior and far-removed colonists\\". In Vol. VI, Part IV, of the Medical Repository, 1803, pp. 449‚Äì50, Mitchill, wrote the following under the heading of \\"Medical and Philosophical News\\":  Republic of Fredonia  In December 1826, a group of Anglo-American settlers and filibusters led by Empresario Haden Edwards in what is now Texas, declared the \\"Republic of Fredonia\\" centered in the town of Nacogdoches. This was the first attempt by Anglo settlers in Texas to secede from Mexico and form an independent state. The republic was short-lived however, lasting only from December 21, 1826 ‚Äì January 23, 1827 when Mexican soldiers and Anglo militia men from Stephen F. Austin's colony put the rebellion down. = 1930s = In the Marx Brother's film Duck Soup, the tiny fictitious county of Freedonia (\\"Land of the Brave, and Free\\") is suffering from severe financial problems and government leaders request a loan from wealthy widow Mrs. Teasdale to keep things afloat. The widow agrees on the condition that Rufus T. Firefly, played by Groucho Marx, take control and run the country. In the musical number that accompanies Firefly's first day in office, Groucho lets the audience know how things will run, singing lyrics such as \\"The last man nearly ruined this place, he didn't know what to do with it / If you think this country's bad off now, just wait 'til I get through with it.\\" Firefly insults and angers Ambassador Trentino from the neighboring nation of Sylvania, which leads Freedonia into war. When the film was first released, the village of Fredonia, New York, complained about the possible negative impact the film might have on them. The Marx Brothers replied \\"Change the name of your town. It is hurting our picture.\\" The satirical depiction of Freedonia is said to have led Benito Mussolini to ban the film in Italy. = 1960s = In the 1960s, Woody Allen, working on Candid Camera, used Freedonia as a practical joke by asking passersby what they thought of the bid for independence for Freedonia. = 1970s = In the film Jabberwocky (1977), Freedonia is one of the kingdoms conquered by the King Bruno the Questionable. = 1980s = The American game publisher FASA's name was originally supposed to stand for \\"Freedonian Aeronautics and Space Administration.\\" In their first publication (a set of starship deck plans for the game Traveller), the accompanying introduction was signed \\"Rufus T Firefly, Director\\". = 1990s = In the Sierra Entertainment PC game Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire (1990), the character Ali Chica is a parody of Chico Marx. If a non-player character is asked about Ali Chica after his disappearance, the player is told that he went to Fredonia. In the 1990s, the satirical magazine Spy pulled a practical joke on several members of the United States Congress. Impersonating a New York radio host (Henry Rose), the magazine successfully convinced several newcomers to Congress to comment on the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in Freedonia, without their realizing that Freedonia was a fictional country.\\"Parliament of suckers: Spy says 'Welcome' to freshman Congress class.\\" Spy, \\"July‚ÄìAugust 1994\\". (The dating is obscure. The story itself is dated February 1992. There is commentary on it dated early 1993.)

Retrieved 12 January 2011 Principality of Freedonia The Principality of Freedonia was a micronation based on libertarian principles. It was created as a \\"hypothetical project\\" by a group of teenagers in the United States in 1992. The project was formalized as a new country project in 1997, which included attempts in 2001 to lease territory in Somaliland. The attempt to lease land was rejected. = 2000s = Duck Soup is used as in-joke amongst characters portrayed as knowledgeable about the film in a Season 3 (2001‚Äì2002) episode of The West Wing, while another episode in Season 6 (2004‚Äì2005) recalls the general plot details of Duck Soup. In \\"Enemies Foreign and Domestic\\", C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn, and Toby Ziegler are discussing the relevancy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in a post-Soviet world. C.J., being briefed by Sam on a number of countries she has to mention as possible new candidates for NATO membership, wonders why Freedonia's being left out of the mix. She goes on to reference Groucho Marx by singing \\"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\\" (which was his character in Animal Crackers) under her breath. When upbraided by Toby for not taking the briefing seriously, she asks why her attempt at humor is less valid than Sam's or his. Toby responds that he's heard her joke before, implying that he's seen Duck Soup. Determined that her Marx Brothers references be respected, she ends the sequences of references by offering to pay Toby $500 if he will sing \\"Lydia the Tattooed Lady\\" (a song sung by J. Cheever Loophole (Groucho) in \\"At the Circus\\"). During Season 6 the question of the \\"situation in Freedonia\\" was asked of a candidate in a Senate debate, and after the candidate said he was studying it, there was no allowed time for the other candidates to challenge him about the existence of the country. United Kingdom games \\"Democracy\\" (2005) and \\"Democracy 2\\" (2007) featured Freedonia as a playable country. In the game Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek (2007) the character Yanni Volkstaia is an Olympic skier from Fredonia. In the Doctor Who episode \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" (2007), the Doctor claims his companion Martha Jones is from Freedonia. He also claims this in the Doctor Who novel Sting of the Zygons (2007). Although the usage may be intended simply as a plausible name for a country of which the listener (William Shakespeare in the former case) has not heard, it is specifically linked to Duck Soup in at least one official reference work. = 2010s = In the film Despicable Me 3 (2017), Gru's brother Dru lives in Freedonia, and the place was shown to have a cheese festival.  Use in general English  \\"Freedonia\\" is sometimes used in political editorials and news stories to illustrate a point about another, real country. Sometimes the point being made is that a particular country is so small or remote as to be unknown to its readers. Other times, the term may negatively connote that a real country is run by an autocratic leader who is out of step with his or her people. Still other times the author may simply use \\"Freedonia\\" to mean \\"a fictitious country for the purposes of illustration\\".Freedonia on the Potomac McNamee, Mike. \\"Invest in Freedonia!\\" Business Week website.

It is served by the Central line and the branch of the Northern line. The station will also be served by the Elizabeth line when the core section opens. On the Central line it is between and , and on the Northern line it is between and . The station is located at St Giles Circus, the junction of Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road and is in Travelcard Zone 1. History =Central London Railway= The station opened as part of the Central London Railway (CLR) on 30 July 1900.Clive's Underground Line Guides ‚Äì Central Line, Dates From that date until 24 September 1933, the next station eastbound on the Central line was the now-defunct ; the next stop in that direction is now . The platforms are under Oxford Street west of St Giles' Circus, and were originally connected to the ticket hall via lifts at the east end of the platforms. The original station building is in Oxford Street and was designed in common with other CLR stations by Harry Bell Measures. Much modified, it now forms part of the station entrance, and some elements of the original facade survive above the canopy. Apart from those very limited original features of the entrance, the station building otherwise together with a whole row of other elegant old buildings were demolished in 2009. =Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway= The Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR;, now part of the Northern line) arrived here on 22 June 1907Clive's Underground Line Guides ‚Äì Northern Line, Dates but used the name Oxford Street until an interchange (linking the eastbound Central line with the southbound Northern line via the ends of the platform) was opened on 3 September 1908 from when the present name was used for both lines. The next station north on the Northern line was originally called Tottenham Court Road, but was renamed to at this time. The original ticket office was directly beneath St Giles circus and was accessed from stairs on three street corners around the Circus. Its original lift shafts and emergency stairs are still extant. A set of emergency stairs can used as access down to the ends of the Northern line platform. The lift shafts are used for offices and station facilities. =Early Improvements= Like a number of other central area stations, Tottenham Court Road underwent improvements during the 1920s to replace the original sets of lifts with escalators. Works commenced in 1923; a new subsurface ticket hall, under St Giles Circus, was constructed and the escalators came into service on 28 September 1926 (upper set) and 1 February 1926 (lower set).Railways Through The Clay; Croome & Jackson; London; 1993; p169 A shaft for three escalators was driven from the ticket hall under the junction down to the east end of the Central line platforms ending at an intermediate circulation space. A further pair of escalators descend from this level to the north end of the Northern line platforms. The lifts were removed and the redundant shafts were used as ventilation ducts. In 1938 a chiller plant began operating at the station. This was decommissioned in 1949. Passenger congestion entering and leaving the Northern line platforms was partially eased by the addition of a short single escalator at the centre of the platform leading up to a passageway linking to the intermediate circulation area. However, this was in itself a cause of congestion, as traffic trying to leave the station from the Northern line found itself in the path of traffic entering and travelling to the Central line. In 1984 the entire station was redecorated, losing the distinctive Leslie Green-designed platform tiling pattern of the Yerkes tube lines (which included the CCE&HR;), and the plain white platform tiles of the CLR. The 1980s design includes panels of tessellated and hand cut smalti mural mosaic by Eduardo Paolozzi (whose signature appears at several places within the station), and is a distinct and noticeable feature of the station. The mosaic's frenetic design is intended to reflect the station's position adjacent to Tottenham Court Road's large concentration of hi-fi and electronics shops. During the expansion works for the expansion of the station for Crossrail sections of the mosaic were restored, moved or replaced while other section were destroyed, some sections of which have been removed to be conserved at the University of Edinburgh. =Upgrade and expansion= The station had four entrances to the sub-surface ticket hall from the north-east, south-west and north-west corners of the junction and from a subway beneath the Centre Point building which starts on Andrew Borde Street. The entrances were frequently congested leading to occasions during peak periods of the day when they were briefly closed to prevent overcrowding in the station. In the aftermath of the King's Cross fire in 1987, London Underground was recommended to investigate \\"passenger flow and congestion in stations and take remedial action\\". A Parliamentary bill was tabled in 1991 to permit London Underground to improve and expand the frequently congested station, however this was not proceeded with. In 2000, London Underground consulted on an station upgrade including a new larger ticket hall, new escalators and step free access, which would have taken 4 years to construct. The station was eventually reconstructed and upgraded in the mid 2010s as part of the Crossrail project, with the ¬£500m station upgrade taking 8 years. The works involved building a much larger ticket hall under the forecourt of Centre Point, new sets of escalators to reach the central section of the Northern line platforms from the ticket hall, step-free access to the platforms, as well as escalators down to the eastern end of the future Crossrail station. The subway to Andrew Borde Street was replaced as part of this development.Crossrail ‚Äì Proposal for eastern ticket hall To enable this expansion to occur, both the Astoria theatres and the original Central line entrance were demolished. As part of the expansion of the ticket hall, Art on the Underground commissioned an artwork by Daniel Buren, a French conceptual artist. This piece, 'Diamonds and Circles' permanent works 'in situ', was Buren's first permanent public commission in the UK. The artwork comprises colourful diamond and circle shapes, which contrast with Buren's trademark stripes in black and white, fixed to internal glass walls throughout the ticket hall. The piece was completed in 2017.Daniel Buren's artwork. From 2 April until 28 November 2011, the Northern line platforms were closed for structural upgrade works and Northern line trains ran non-stop through the station. From 5 January until 7 December 2015, the Central line platforms were closed, meaning Central line trains did not stop at the station. On 12 January 2015, the first part of the new ticket hall opened for the first time. The station which previously required commuters going through the Central line level concourse to get to the Northern line, via a one-way system, now has escalators directly to Northern line level followed by stairs to the platforms. The escalators are among the longest in the tube, and take a minute top to bottom. Current developments =Crossrail= In addition to the eastern ticket hall expansion, a new western entrance and ticket hall is being built under Dean StreetCrossrail ‚Äì Proposal for western ticket hall as part of the Crossrail project, leading to both the Crossrail platforms and to the parallel Central line platforms. The Crossrail station 'box' was constructed as part of the Underground ticket hall works, and completed in an un-fitted form by 12 January 2015. Similar to the situation with Thameslink platforms at St Pancras, the line developers are responsible for the fitting-out works which create the actual station infrastructure.

This would be the only planned interchange between Crossrail 1 and Crossrail 2. A massive boost in capacity to the existing station will be needed to host both lines. The station was safeguarded as part of the route in 1991 and 2007. Redevelopment of the station will include space for platforms on the line.

It is managed by the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society. It uses steam trains which operate between and , with intermediate stations at and . It is the first preserved standard gauge steam-operated passenger railway in the world to operate a public service. The society ran its first train on 7 August 1960, less than three years after the line from East Grinstead to Lewes had been closed by British Railways. On 23 March 2013, the Bluebell Railway started to run through to its new terminus station. At East Grinstead there is a connection to the national rail network, the first connection of the Bluebell Railway to the national network in 50 years, since the Horsted Keynes ‚Äì line closed in 1963. Today the railway is managed and run largely by volunteers. Having preserved a number of steam locomotives even before steam stopped running on British mainline railways in 1968, today it has over 30 steam locomotives ‚Äì the largest collection in the UK after the National Railway Museum. The Bluebell also has almost 150 carriages and wagons, most of them pre-1939.  History  In 1877 an Act of Parliament authorised construction of the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway (L&EGR;)., pp 189-190. The line was sponsored by local landowners, including the Earl of Sheffield. A year later another Act enabled the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company (LB&SCR;), chaired by Samuel Laing, to acquire and operate the line. The line had six stations, but only Barcombe was within walking distance of a village. Chailey parish had two stations, one at and the other at . It was customary for a rural line supported by a company or individuals to have stations close to the residences of its sponsors. Thus Sheffield Park station was built for the Earl of Sheffield, and Newick and Chailey for Newick Park and Reedens, the homes of two other sponsors. The other stations were at , and . A branch ran from a junction at Horsted Keynes to and on the LB&SCR; main line. The 1877 and 1878 Acts included a clause that: This imposed a legal requirement to provide a service, and the only way to remove this obligation was to pass another Act. Designed under instructions from LB&SCR; Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the line was constructed to take double track. However, only the section between East Grinstead and Horsted Keynes (and thence to Haywards Heath via Ardingly) was laid as such; south of the junction at Horsted Keynes the line was single track with passing loops at stations. The line was opened in 1882. Goods traffic on the line consisted of local produce; milk: farm products and coal, and timber to and from Albert Turner & Son, a sawmill. The only time Sheffield Park received a substantial number of passengers was when Lord Sheffield entertained the Australian cricket team, with a match between them and Lord Sheffield's own team. =Accident= On 31 July 1943, newlyweds Ronald Knapp and Winifred Standing were killed when they were pulled under a train from Lewes to East Grinstead.Article on local news website The couple walked along the railway on a dark rainy night. When the train got to Horsted Keynes, the guard found a raincoat covered with blood on the engine. Another coat was found near two bodies in the middle of the tracks. The ganger who found them told the inquest the couple must have been walking with their backs to the train. \\"There was a very heavy squall at the time and the couple would probably have not heard a thing,\\" he said. The coroner said Ronald and Winifred were trespassing and no blame could be attached to any railway worker. Little more than a week after they were married, the couple's funeral was at St Giles' Church, Horsted Keynes, where they are buried together in a grave marked by a War Graves Commission headstone. =Closure= In 1954, long before the Beeching Axe, the branch line committee of British Railways proposed closing the line from East Grinstead to Culver Junction near Lewes. This was challenged by local residents, but closure was agreed in February 1955 for 15 June 1955, although the line closed on 29 May due to a rail strike. An acrimonious battle between British Railways and the users of the Bluebell Line then ensued, and lasted three years. Shortly after closure, Margery Bessemer of Chailey discovered in the 1877 and 1878 Acts the clause relating to the \\"Statutory Line\\", and demanded British Railways reinstate services. On 7 August 1956 British Railways reopened the line, with trains stopping at stations mentioned in the Acts. British Railways took the case to the House of Commons in 1957, resulting in a public inquiry. British Railways were censured, but later the Transport Commission persuaded Parliament to repeal the special section of the Act. By this means the line was finally closed on 17 March 1958. Preservation On 15 March 1959 a group that included the future president of the society, Bernard Holden, met in Ardingly and formed the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway Preservation Society. The society elected John Leroy as the first chairman, and ¬£940 was raised in donations to start the society. On a vote at the meeting, the society changed its name to the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society. The society's initial aim was to reopen the whole line from East Grinstead to Culver Junction as a commercial service, using a two-car DMU. The plans came to nothing: the society failed to buy the whole line, and most local residents were not interested. The committee then recommended that the stretch of track between Sheffield Park and Horsted Keynes could be run as a tourist attraction, with vintage locomotives and stock operated by unpaid volunteer staff. =Sheffield Park to Horsted Keynes= As BR still ran an electrified line from Horsted Keynes to Ardingly, the society leased a stretch of track from BR just south of this. In 1960 the interim line was opened, running from Sheffield Park to Bluebell Halt, south of Horsted Keynes. In 1962 the society extended services to Horsted Keynes. Also in 1962 a halt was opened at Holywell (Waterworks). However, this was closed the following year. BR withdrew passenger services from Horsted Keynes to Haywards Heath in 1963; and with complete closure of the line north of Horsted Keynes, the Bluebell Line was severed from the BR system. =Horsted Keynes to Kingscote= In 1974 the society purchased the freehold of the demolished West Hoathly station, allowing the first steps to be taken towards an extension northwards towards East Grinstead station. It then purchased the freehold of the site of Kingscote station in January 1985. These efforts culminated in a public inquiry, with the Secretaries of State for the Environment and Transport giving planning permission and a Light Railway Order for an extension to East Grinstead in 1985. The Bluebell Railway Preservation Society completed the extension from Horsted Keynes to Kingscote in April 1994, re-laying track through Sharpthorne Tunnel, which at is the longest on a UK heritage railway. At the north end of Sharpthorne Tunnel, the line passes through the site of the former West Hoathly railway station. It was demolished in 1967, but remains of the platforms and goods dock are still visible. 2010 marked the Bluebell's 50th anniversary of running trains. To mark the event, the railway held a gala over 6‚Äì8 August 2010 with all available home engines and two visitor engines.50th Anniversary Events Some of the society's founder members gathered at Horsted Keynes to mark the arrival of a commemorative LB&SCR; A1X class No.55 Stepney-hauled steam train. The entourage then travelled towards Sheffield Park. =Kingscote to East Grinstead via Imberhorne= This cutting between Kingscote and East Grinstead had been used as a rubbish tip, and the waste material had to be cleared before the line could be reopened. The track northeast of this point was relaid to allow the waste to be removed by rail. From its inception, the society had always planned to work northwards towards East Grinstead, where the line would connect with the national network. BR donated Imberhorne Viaduct to the railway in 1992, but the purchase of the final pieces of the by then privately owned track bed north to East Grinstead was only completed in 2003, allowing physical civil engineering activity to be undertaken from that year. A major problem was the former landfill site in the cutting just south of Imberhorne Viaduct. It had been filled with domestic waste by East Grinstead Town Council in the 1960s and 1970s, but tests undertaken by contractors working for both the society and the borough council found the of waste within the cutting were not toxic. The excavated clay-cap covering the landfill site was taken south by rail, to fill the site of a removed viaduct and embankment on the old Ardingly spur. In January 2008 agreement was given to start clearing foliage on the section of the tip between Imberhorne Lane and Hill Place bridges. In a public launch event, BBC newsreader Nicholas Owen‚Äîa local resident and society volunteer‚Äîstarted removal of the actual waste on 25 November 2008. Initially rubbish was removed from the site by lorry, but, due to the substantial volume and cost of about ¬£45/tonne, in 2009 a trial removal of spoil by rail was carried out by DB Schenker Rail (UK). At ¬£25,000 per train and now undertaken by GB Railfreight, this practice continued periodically as funds became available. However, an increase in the landfill tax was announced in 2008, and this was due to take effect from April 2012. It would increase the cost of removal from ¬£25/tonne to ¬£90/tonne. So the society formed an appeal to complete the removal of the landfill waste by the end of March 2012. With the receiving site changed to Appleford, Oxfordshire and thanks to the \\"tenner for the tip\\" appeal, the cash target was met and the rubbish was removed by rail in time. In autumn 2008 work started on site clearance at East Grinstead for construction of the new station about south of the national rail station. At the railway's 50th anniversary celebration weekend in 2010, East Sussex resident Dame Vera Lynn launched a ¬£3.8 million appeal; the greater part of this amount would be put towards reconnecting the line to East Grinstead. Mid Sussex District Council responded with a one-off donation of ¬£50,000 towards the reconnection. On 7 March 2013, the last section of track was formally joined using a white fishplate, with the honour of tightening the four bolts being given to Barbara Watkins, a long-standing Bluebell Railway volunteer. The extension to East Grinstead was officially opened on Saturday 23 March, with a two-week opening festival starting that day. =West: Horsted Keynes to Haywards Heath via Ardingly= The Ardingly spur, just south of Hanson Aggregates depot, Originally built as a double-track line, it was electrified in the 1930s, with 2-NOL units used for the Seaford-Horsted Keynes service. The line between Horsted Keynes and Ardingly was operated as single-track in its final years, with 2-BIL/Class 401 and 2-HAL/Class 402 units. The second track was left in place and used for carriage storage, most notably the new Kent Coast electric stock prior to its introduction and later the steam-hauled stock that it replaced. After the line's closure in 1963, the trackbed was purchased in its entirety by a member of the local gentry. In the 1990s the society bought the abandoned trackbed west between Horsted Keynes and Ardingly from his estate. This included up to the Hanson Aggregates depot built on the former Ardingly station site. The society plans to reconnect the line with Network Rail at Copyhold Junction, to allow access to the London to Brighton main line. Stations could either be located at Copyhold or Haywards Heath. There is a proposal that the line could be restored as third rail electrified, allowing operation of the society's electric stock. While the Lywood Tunnel remains in good condition, there are two major areas of work that would be required to re-open the line, these being the replacement of a short girder-bridge span bridge and the Sheriff Mill Viaduct, which was demolished in 1969. The removed clay-cap from Imberhorne cutting has been deposited on the banks of the former Sherriff Mill viaduct to allow later bridging of the gap. Also in 2013, the former Tewkesbury and Malvern Railway bridge that crossed over the M50 motorway were donated to the railway for eventual installation in the replacement bridge. =South: Sheffield Park to Lewes= Looking south towards the former line to Newick and Chailey and to Lewes, from Sheffield Park By the late Victorian era, Lewes station was the convergence point of three lines from the East Sussex coast and three lines to the north all of which reached London via Croydon. Today, Lewes has a line to the north which joins the Brighton main Line at Burgess Hill and from there on to Gatwick Airport, East Croydon and London, a line west towards Brighton, a line south to Newhaven and Seaford, and a line east to Eastbourne, Hastings and Ashford. Originally the Bluebell Line was the straightest and quickest route from Lewes to London. The Bluebell Railway ran directly south from Sheffield Park to Culver Junction (at Culver Farm just south of Barcombe Mills), with intermediate stations at and . At Culver Junction it joined the 1858 Wealden Line (part of which is now restored as the nearby Heritage Lavender Line), thereby gaining access to Lewes. The section from East Grinstead to Culver Junction was closed in 1958, and the Lewes to Uckfield line in 1969 by British Rail. Bluebell supporters and committee members have expressed interest in re-building the line south by three more stations to Lewes. However, a substantial number of large civil engineering obstacles and intrusions onto the former trackbed make this a difficult project to envisage the completion of. For execution, the project would require: *The bridging of the raised, widened and re-aligned A275 road immediately south of Sheffield Park *The re-excavation of waste-infill under the former road bridges just south of Sheffield Park and Barcombe stations *The in-filling since of the cutting and former route under the A272 road *The re-excavation of waste-infill at the former , which includes industrial waste producing large amounts of methane gas discharges *The fact that a large private housing estate has been built on and surrounding the former Newick and Chailey site The remaining undeveloped line from Lewes to Sheffield Park has been safeguarded as a bridleway and footpath.Lewes District Council Local Plan, Chapter 9, paragraph 9.19  Stations  Sheffield Park station Horsted Keynes station Kingscote station with AEC Routemaster bus on Route 473 East Grinstead - Kingscote service The various stations have been restored to show different periods of the railway's life: *Sheffield Park has been restored to a Victorian ambience, as it would have appeared during the time of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (up to 1922) *Horsted Keynes emulates the Southern Railway from 1922 to 1948 *West Hoathly (if built) will emulate the British Railways of the late 1940s *Kingscote echoes the British Railways of the 1950s * East Grinstead is an amalgam of British Railways of the 1950s and 1960s =Heritage railway= ;East Grinstead to Sheffield Park *East Grinstead (closed) Bluebell Halt (closed) * Holywell (Waterworks) (closed) * Freshfield Halt (closed) * Ketches Halt (closed) * ;Horsted Keynes to Ardingly (proposed) (proposed) = Original stations = ;Lewes to East Grinstead (Low Level) * *Kingscote *West Hoathly *Horsted Keynes *Sheffield Park *Newick and Chailey *Barcombe *Lewes  Rolling stock  Sheffield Park The Bluebell Railway preserved a number of steam locomotives before the cessation of steam service on British mainline railways in 1968. Today it has the largest collection - over 30 - of steam locomotives in the UK after the National Railway Museum (NRM). The society also has a collection of almost 150 carriages and wagons, most of them pre-war. A project is under way to recreate a long-lost type of locomotive (LB&SCR; H2 class Atlantic) from a few surviving parts. In April 2008, the Heritage Lottery Fund provided a ¬£2.8M grant towards new buildings next to , to provide weatherproof shelter for up to 17 carriages. The funds were also used to: create a museum and interpretation area; create new facilities for locomotive crews; create a rainwater catchment system from the roof of the carriage building, which is then processed and used to fill the steam engines' boilers; restore the railway's historic platform buildings. Twinning The Bluebell Railway is twinned with the Museumstoomtram Hoorn ‚Äì Medemblik, which links Hoorn and Medemblik, Noord Holland, the Netherlands.

A \\"woman of letters\\" who published in multiple genres, Barbauld had a successful writing career at a time when women rarely wrote professionally. She was a noted teacher at the Palgrave Academy and an innovative writer of works for children; her primers provided a model for more than a century.William McCarthy, \\"Mother of All Discourses: Anna Barbauld's Lessons for Children\\"; Culturing the Child, 1690‚Äì1914: Essays in Memory of Mitzi Myers, ed. Donelle Ruwe. Lanham, MD: The Children's Literature Association and the Scarecrow Press, Inc. (2005). Her essays showed it was possible for a woman to be publicly engaged in politics; other women authors such as Elizabeth Benger emulated her.Armstrong, Isobel. \\"The Gush of the Feminine: How Can we Read Women's Poetry of the Romantic Period?\\" Romantic Women Writers: Voices and Countervoices, eds Paula R.

John Beer. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press (1995). Barbauld's literary career spanned numerous periods in British literary history: her work promoted the values of the Enlightenment and of sensibility, while her poetry made a founding contribution to the development of British Romanticism.Anne Janowitz, Women Romantic Poets: Anna Barbauld and Mary Robinson. Tavistock: Northcote House (2003). Barbauld was also a literary critic. Her anthology of 18th-century novels helped to establish the canon as it is known today. Barbauld's career as a poet ended abruptly in 1812, with the publication of Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime.Anna Letitia Barbauld, Anna Letitia Barbauld: Selected Poetry and Prose, eds. William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft. Peterborough: Broadview Press Ltd. (2002), p. 160. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the 19th century, and largely forgotten in the 20th, until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.William McCarthy, \\"A 'High-Minded Christian Lady': The Posthumous Reception of Anna Letitia Barbauld.\\" Romanticism and Women Poets: Opening the Doors of Reception, eds. Harriet Kramer Linkin and Stephen C. Behrendt. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, (1999). Sources Much of what is known about Barbauld's life comes from two memoirs, the first published in 1825 and written by her niece, Lucy Aikin, and the second published in 1874, written by her great-niece Anna Letitia Le Breton. Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist. However, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that resulted from the London blitz in 1940.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. xvi. Early life Barbauld and her brother, John Aikin (shown here in later years), became literary partners Barbauld was born on 20 June 1743 at Kibworth Harcourt in Leicestershire to Jane and John Aikin. She was named after her maternal grandmother and referred to as \\"Nancy\\" (a nickname for Anna). She was baptised by her mother's brother, John Jennings, in Huntingdonshire two weeks after her birth.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 7. Barbauld's father was headmaster of the dissenting academy in Kibworth Harcourt and minister at a nearby Presbyterian church. She spent her childhood in what Barbauld scholar William McCarthy describes as \\"one of the best houses in Kibworth and in the very middle of the village square.\\" She was much in the public eye, as the house was also a boys' school. The family had a comfortable standard of living. McCarthy suggests they may have ranked with large freeholders, well- to-do tradesmen, and manufacturers. At Barbauld's father's death in 1780, his estate was valued at more than ¬£2,500.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, pp. 17‚Äì18. Barbauld commented to her husband in 1773: \\"For the early part of my life I conversed little with my own Sex. In the Village where I was, there was none to converse with.\\"Quoted in McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 23. Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin's memoir, what resulted was \\"a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve\\" in Barbauld's character.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, pp. 23‚Äì24. Barbauld was uncomfortable with her identity as a woman and believed she had failed to live up to the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would focus on issues central to women, and her outsider perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity being made in the 18th century.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, pp. 28‚Äì29. Barbauld demanded that her father teach her the classics and after much pestering, he did.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 32. She had the opportunity to learn not only Latin and Greek, but French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unnecessary for women at the time.Betsy Rodgers, Georgian Chronicle: Mrs Barbauld & her Family. London: Methuen & Co. Ltd. (1958), p. 30. Barbauld's penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism. The two were never so close as Barbauld and her father.Rodgers, p. 30. Yet Barbauld's mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter, \\"I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall.\\"Quoted in Anna Letitia Le Breton, Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld, including Letters and Notices of Her Family and Friends. London: George Bell and Sons (1874), pp. 23‚Äì24. Barbauld's brother, John Aikin, described their father as \\"the best parent, the wisest counsellor, the most affectionate friend, every thing that could command love and veneration\\".Quoted in McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 30. Barbauld's father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 31. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her only sibling during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship: \\"How few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have been through so long a course of years!\\"McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. 36. Warrington Academy in 1757 In 1758, the family moved to Warrington Academy, halfway between the growing industrial cities of Liverpool and Manchester, where Barbauld's father had been offered a teaching position. Some of the founders of the academy were members of Octagon Chapel, whose creedless and liberal \\"Liverpool Liturgy\\" formed a starting point for her beliefs and writings McCarthy, pp. 152‚Äì3. The Academy drew many luminaries of the day, such as the natural philosopher and Unitarian theologian Joseph Priestley, and came to be known as \\"the Athens of the North\\" for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere.Rodgers, p. 38. Another instructor may have been the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat. School records suggest he taught French there in the 1770s. He may also have been a suitor to Barbauld ‚Äì he allegedly wrote to John Aikin declaring his intention to become an English citizen and marry her.Rodgers, p. 44. Archibald Hamilton Rowan also fell in love with Barbauld, describing her later as \\"possessed of great beauty, distinct traces of which she retained to the latest of her life. Her person was slender, her complexion exquisitely fair with the bloom of perfect health; her features regular and elegant, and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit and fancy.\\"Quoted in Rodgers, pp. 51‚Äì52. Despite her mother's anxiety, Barbauld received many offers of marriage around this time ‚Äì all of which she declined. First literary successes and marriage Joseph Priestley (c. 1763): \\"Mrs. Barbauld has told me that it was the perusal of some verses of mine that first induced her to write any thing in verse.\\"Robert E. Schofield, The Enlightenment of Joseph Priestley: A Stud of His Life and Work from 1733 to 1773. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press (1997), p. 93. In 1773, Barbauld brought out her first book of poems, after her friends had praised them and convinced her to publish them.Rodgers, p. 57. The collection, entitled simply Poems, went through four editions in a single year and surprised Barbauld by its success. Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of Poems alone. In the same year, she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to those of Samuel Johnson.Rodgers, pp. 61‚Äì62. In May 1774, despite some \\"misgivings\\", Barbauld married Rochemont Barbauld (1749‚Äì1808), the grandson of a French Huguenot and a former pupil at Warrington. According to Barbauld's niece, Lucy Aikin: After the wedding, the couple moved to Suffolk, near where Rochemont had been offered a congregation and a school for boys.Rodgers, pp. 63‚Äì64. Barbauld took this time and rewrote some of the psalms, a common pastime in the 18th century, publishing them as Devotional Pieces Compiled from the Psalms and the Book of Job. Attached to this work is her essay \\"Thoughts on the Devotional Taste, on Sects and on Establishments\\", which explains her theory of religious feeling and the problems inherent in institutionalising religion. It seems that Barbauld and her husband were concerned that they would never have a child of their own, and in 1775, after only a year of marriage, Barbauld suggested to her brother that they adopt one of his children: After a time, her brother conceded and the couple adopted Charles. it was for him that Barbauld wrote her most famous books: Lessons for Children (1778‚Äì79) and Hymns in Prose for Children (1781). Palgrave Academy Barbauld and her husband spent eleven years teaching at Palgrave Academy in Suffolk. Early on, Barbauld was responsible not only for running her own household, but also the school's, to which she served as accountant, maid, and housekeeper.William McCarthy, \\"The Celebrated Academy at Palgrave: A Documentary History of Anna Letitia Barbauld's School.\\" The Age of Johnson: A Scholarly Annual 8 (1997), p. 282. The school opened with only eight boys, but the number had risen to about forty by the time the Barbaulds left in 1785, which reflects the excellent reputation the school had acquired.McCarthy, \\"Academy,\\" pp. 284‚Äì85. The Barbaulds' educational philosophy attracted Dissenters as well as Anglicans. Palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as Eton, which often used corporal punishment, with a system of \\"fines and jobations\\" and even, it seems likely, \\"juvenile trials,\\" that is, trials run by and for the students themselves.McCarthy, \\"Academy,\\" p. 292. Moreover, instead of the traditional classical studies, the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages. Barbauld herself taught the foundation subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys, and geography, history, composition, rhetoric and science to higher grade levels.McCarthy, \\"Academy,\\" p. 298. She was a dedicated teacher, producing a \\"weekly chronicle\\" for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform.McCarthy, \\"Academy,\\" p. 306. Barbauld had a profound effect on many of her students. One who went on to great success was William Taylor, a pre-eminent scholar of German literature, who referred to Barbauld as \\"the mother of his mind.\\"Quoted in Rodgers, p. 75. Political involvement and Hampstead Design for the medallion of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade (formed 1787), struck by Josiah Wedgwood In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave for a tour of France. By this time Rochemont's mental health was deteriorating and he was no longer able to carry out his teaching duties.Rodgers, p. 92. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often boarded one or two pupils recommended by personal friends.Rodgers, pp. 101‚Äì102. Barbauld lived on Hampstead's Church Row in the early 1800s, though it is not known exactly which house she occupied. During this time, the heyday of the French Revolution, Barbauld published her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts (see Test Act). Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce's attempt to outlaw the slave trade had failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abolish slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: \\"We are called upon to repent of national sins, because we can help them, and because we ought to help them.\\"Anna Letitia Barbauld, \\"Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation.\\" Anna Letitia Barbauld: Selected Poetry and Prose. eds. William McCarthy and Elizabeth Kraft. Ontario: Broadview Press, Ltd. (2002), p. 300. Stoke Newington: an end to a literary career In 1802, the Barbaulds moved to Stoke Newington, where they lived at 113 Church Street. Rochemont took over the pastoral duties of the Unitarian Chapel at Newington Green. Barbauld herself was happy to be nearer her brother, John, as her husband's mind was rapidly failing.Rodgers, pp. 128‚Äì29. Rochemont developed a \\"violent antipathy to his wife and he was liable to fits of insane fury directed against her. One day at dinner he seized a knife and chased her round the table so that she only saved herself by jumping out of the window.\\"Rodgers, p. 136; Le Breton, pp. 121‚Äì22. Such scenes repeated themselves to Barbauld's great sadness and real danger, but she refused to leave him. Rochemont drowned himself in the nearby New River in 1808 and Barbauld was overcome with grief. When she returned to writing, she produced the radical poem Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812), which depicted England as a ruin. It was reviewed so viciously that Barbauld never published another work in her lifetime, although it is now often viewed by scholars as her greatest poetic achievement.Rodgers, pp. 139‚Äì141. She died in 1825, a renowned writer, and was buried in the family vault in St Mary's, Stoke Newington. After her death, a marble tablet was erected in the Newington Green Chapel with the following inscription: In Memory of ANNA LETITIA BARBAULD, Daughter of John Aikin, D.D. And Wife of The Rev. Rochemont Barbauld, Formerly the Respected Minister of this Congregation. She was born at Kibworth in Leicestershire, 20 June 1743, and died at Stoke Newington, 9 March 1825. Endowed by the Giver of all Good With Wit, Genius, Poetic Talent, and a Vigorous Understanding She Employed these High Gifts in Promoting the Cause of Humanity, Peace, and Justice, of Civil and Religious Liberty, of Pure, Ardent, and Affectionate Devotion. Let the Young, Nurtured by her Writings in the Pure Spirit of Christian Morality; Let those of Maturer Years, Capable of Appreciating the Acuteness, the Brilliant Fancy, and Sound Reasoning of her Literary Compositions; Let the Surviving few who shared her Delightful and Instructive Conversation, Bear Witness That this Monument Records No Exaggerated Praise.Le Breton, p. 197. Original title page from Eighteen Hundred and Eleven Legacy Engraving, published in 1785 At her death, Barbauld was lauded in the Newcastle Magazine as \\"unquestionably the first [i.e., best] of our female poets, and one of the most eloquent and powerful of our prose writers\\" and the Imperial Magazine declared \\"so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain, or wherever the English language shall be known, so long will the name of this lady be respected.\\"Quoted in McCarthy, \\"Posthumous Reception,\\" p. 165. She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson ‚Äì no mean feat for a woman writer in the 18th century.McCarthy, \\"Posthumous Reception,\\" p. 166. By 1925, however, she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism in the academic world of the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history. Barbauld's remarkable disappearance from the literary landscape took place for a number of reasons. One of the most important was the disdain heaped upon her by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, poets who in their youthful, radical days had looked to her poetry for inspiration, but in their later, conservative years dismissed her work. Once these poets had become canonised, their opinions held sway.McCarthy, \\"Posthumous Reception,\\" pp. 167‚Äì168. Moreover, the intellectual ferment of which Barbauld was an important part of ‚Äì particularly at the Dissenting academies ‚Äì had by the end of the 19th century come to be associated with the \\"philistine\\" middle class, as Matthew Arnold put it. The reformist 18th-century middle class was later held responsible for the excesses and abuses of the industrial age.McCarthy, \\"Posthumous Reception,\\" p. 169. Finally, the Victorians viewed Barbauld as \\"an icon of sentimental saintliness\\" and \\"erased her political courage, her tough mindedness, [and] her talent for humor and irony\\", to arrive at a literary figure that modernists despised.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, pp. xiii‚Äìxiv. As literary studies developed into a discipline at the end of the 19th century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it. According to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age.McCarthy, \\"Posthumous Reception,\\" pp. 174‚Äì175. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman ‚Äì one who was angry, who resisted the gender roles of her time, and who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women.McCarthy, \\"Posthumous Reception,\\" p. 182. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories. Indeed, it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re- examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice that Barbauld had contributed. Barbauld's works fell out of print and no full-length scholarly biography of her was written until William McCarthy's Anna Letitia Barbauld: Voice of the Enlightenment in 2009.McCarthy, Voice of the Enlightenment, p. xv. Barbauld's adopted son Charles grew up to be a doctor and chemist. He married a daughter of Gilbert Wakefield. Their child, Anna Letitia Le Breton, wrote literary memoirs, which included a Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld, including Letters and Notices of her Family and Friends in 1874. Literary analysis =Poetry= \\"The Mouse's Petition\\" from Barbauld's Poems (1773) Barbauld's wide-ranging poetry has been read primarily by feminist literary critics interested in recovering women writers important in their own time, but forgotten in literary history. Isobel Armstrong's work represents one way to do such a study; she argues that Barbauld, like other Romantic women poets: In her subsequent analysis of \\"Inscription for an Ice-House\\" Armstrong points to Barbauld's challenge of Edmund Burke's characterisation of the sublime and the beautiful and Adam Smith's economic theories in the Wealth of Nations as evidence for this interpretation.Armstrong, pp. 18 and 22‚Äì23. Poems (1777) The work of Marlon Ross and Anne K. Mellor represents a second way to apply the insights of feminist theory to the recovery of women writers. They argue that Barbauld and other Romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere. As a woman and a dissenter, Barbauld had a unique perspective on society, according to Ross, and it was this specific position that obliged her to publish social commentary.Marlon B. Ross, \\"Configurations of Feminine Reform: The Woman Writers and the Tradition of Dissent.\\" Re-visioning Romanticism: British Women Writers, 1776‚Äì1837, eds Carol Shiner Wilson and Joel Haefner. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press (1994), p. 93. Ross points out, however, that women were in a double bind: \\"They could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes, and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion, or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable 'feminine' decorum, again risking a softening of their political agenda.\\"Ross, p. 94. So Barbauld and other Romantic women poets often wrote \\"occasional poems\\". These had traditionally commented, often satirically, on national events, but by the end of the 18th century were increasingly serious and personal. Women wrote sentimental poems, a style then much in vogue, on personal occasions such as the birth of a child and argued that in commenting on the small occurrences of daily life, they would establish a moral foundation for the nation.Ross, pp. 96‚Äì97. Scholars such as Ross and Mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way in which women poets created a feminine Romanticism. =Political essays and poems= Nine Living Muses of Great Britain by Richard Samuel (1779), from left: Elizabeth Carter, Barbauld gesturing, Angelica Kauffmann, Elizabeth Linleyalt=Detail from a painting, showing four women dressed in classical- inspired costumes in front of a pillar Barbauld's most significant political texts are: An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts (1790), Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade (1791), Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation (1793), and Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812). As Harriet Guest explains, \\"The theme Barbauld's essays of the 1790s repeatedly return to is that of the constitution of the public as a religious, civic, and national body, and she is always concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in capaciously inclusive terms.\\"Harriet Guest, Small Change: Women, Learning, Patriotism, 1750‚Äì1810. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (2000), p. 235. For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters had been attempting to convince Parliament to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which limited the civil rights of Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after \\"nine years of silence\\".McCarthy and Kraft, p. 261. Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone. It opens, \\"We thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them.\\"Anna Letitia Barbauld, \\"An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts\\". Anna Letitia Barbauld: Selected Poetry and Prose, eds. McCarthy and Kraft. Peterborough: Broadview Press Ltd. (2002), p. 263. She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: \\"We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects.\\"Barbauld, \\"An Appeal\\", p. 266. Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship.Barbauld, \\"An Appeal\\", pp. 269‚Äì270. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in extending liberty.Barbauld, \\"An Appeal\\", pp. 278‚Äì79. In the following year, after one of William Wilberforce's many efforts to suppress the slave trade failed to pass Parliament, Barbauld wrote her Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade (1791). In it, she calls Britain to account for the sin of slavery. She condemns in harsh tones the \\"avarice\\" of a country content to allow its wealth and prosperity to be supported by the labour of enslaved human beings. Moreover, she draws a picture of the plantation mistress and master that reveals all of the failings of the \\"colonial enterprise: [an] indolent, voluptuous, monstrous woman\\" and a \\"degenerate, enfeebled man\\".Suvir Kaul, Poems of Nation, Anthems of Empire: English Verse in the Long Eighteenth Century. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press (2000), p. 262. In 1793, when the British government called on the nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: \\"Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved? observe the Fast, but preach against the war? defy the Proclamation and refuse to take any part in the Fast?\\"McCarthy and Kraft, p. 297. Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation, on the moral responsibility of the individual. For her, each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state, and while she argues that \\"insubordination\\" can undermine a government, she admits there are lines of \\"conscience\\" that cannot be crossed in obeying a government.Barbauld, \\"Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation,\\" pp. 316‚Äì17. The text has been seen as a classic consideration of the idea of an \\"unjust war\\". In Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812), written after Britain had been at war with France for a decade and was on the brink of losing the Napoleonic Wars, Barbauld presented a shocking Juvenalian satire: she argued that the British Empire was waning and the American Empire waxing. It is to America that Britain's wealth and fame will now go, she contended, and Britain will become a mere empty ruin. She tied this decline directly to Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars: Not surprisingly, this pessimistic view of the future was poorly received: \\"Reviews, whether in liberal or conservative magazines, ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive.\\"McCarthy and Kraft, p. 160. Barbauld, stunned by the reaction, retreated from the public eye. Even when Britain was on the verge of winning the war, Barbauld could not be joyous. She wrote to a friend, \\"I do not know how to rejoice at this victory, splendid as it is, over Buonaparte, when I consider the horrible waste of life, the mass of misery, which such gigantic combats must occasion.\\"Quoted in Le Breton, p. 132. =Children's literature= Lessons for Children of Three Years Old, Part I Barbauld's Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children made a revolution in children's literature. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them, and even more importantly, she developed a style of \\"informal dialogue between parent and child\\" that would dominate children's literature for a generation.McCarthy, \\"Mother of All Discourses,\\" pp. 88‚Äì89. In Lessons for Children, a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. It is more than likely that many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld's experience of teaching her own son, Charles. The series is far more than a way to acquire literacy ‚Äì it also introduces the reader to \\"elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility.\\"McCarthy, \\"Mother of All Discourses,\\" p. 93. Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of \\"botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy.\\"McCarthy, \\"Mother of All Discourses,\\" p. 100. The series was relatively popular. Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, Practical Education (1798): it is \\"one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared.\\"Edgeworth, Maria. Practical Education, The Novels and Selected Works of Maria Edgeworth, ed. Susan Manly, Vol. 11. London: Pickering and Chatto (2003), p. 195. Some at the time saw Barbauld's work as marking a shift in children's literature from fantasy to didacticism. Sarah Burney, in her popular novel Traits of Nature (1812), has the 14-year-old Christina Cleveland remark, \\"Well, then; you know fairy-tales are forbidden pleasures in all modern school-rooms. Mrs. Barbauld, and Mrs. Trimmer, and Miss Edgeworth, and a hundred others, have written good books for children, which have thrown poor Mother Goose, and the Arabian Nights, quite out of favour; ‚Äì at least, with papas and mamas.\\"Miss [Sarah] Burney: Traits of Nature (London: Henry Colburn, 1812), Vol. II, pp. 68‚Äì69. A more strident criticism was made by the Lambs, telling of Mary's abortive search for a copy of Goody Two Shoes, which her brother claimed was because \\"Mrs. Barbauld's stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery.\\"The Letters of Charles and Mary Anne Lamb, ed. Edwin W. Marrs, Jr. (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1976). Vol. 2, pp. 81‚Äì82. To Samuel Taylor Coleridge dated 23 October 1802. Quoted in Norma Clarke: \\"The Cursed Barbauld Crew...\\" In: Hilton, Mary, et al.: Opening the Nursery Door: Reading, Writing and Childhood 1600‚Äì1900. London: Routledge, 1997, p. 91. Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose had, for children's books, an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Jane Taylor,McCarthy, \\"Mother of All Discourses,\\" pp. 85‚Äì86; Ruwe, \\"Barbauld and the Body-Part Game,\\" 36‚Äì38. they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren. Children's literature scholar William McCarthy states, \\"Elizabeth Barrett Browning could still quote the opening lines of Lessons for Children at age thirty- nine.\\"McCarthy, \\"Mother of All Discourses,\\" p. 85. Although both Samuel Johnson and Charles James Fox ridiculed Barbauld's children's books and believed that she was wasting her talents,Rodgers, p. 71. Barbauld herself saw such writing as noble and encouraged others to follow her. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer explains, \\"She gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard.\\"Rodgers, p. 72. In fact, because of Barbauld, Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were inspired to write for poor children as well as organise a large-scale Sunday School movement, Ellenor Fenn to write and design a series of readers and games for middle- class children, and Richard Lovell Edgeworth to begin one of the first systematic studies of childhood development, which would culminate in an educational treatise authored by Maria Edgeworth and him, and in a large body of children's stories by Maria.Mitzi Myers, \\"Of Mice and Mothers: Mrs. Barbauld's 'New Walk' and Gendered Codes in Children's Literature\\". Feminine Principles and Women's Experience in American Composition and Rhetoric, eds. Louise Wetherbee Phelps and Janet Ennig. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press (1995), p. 261. Barbauld also collaborated with her brother John Aikin on the six-volume series Evenings at Home (1793). It is a miscellany of stories, fables, dramas, poems, and dialogues. In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an Enlightenment education: \\"curiosity, observation, and reasoning.\\"Fyfe, Aileen. \\"Reading Children's Books in Late Eighteenth-Century Dissenting Families.\\" The Historical Journal 43.2 (2000), p. 469. For example, the stories encourage the learning of science through hands-on activities: in \\"A Tea Lecture\\" the child learns that tea-making is \\"properly an operation of chemistry\\" and lessons on evaporation, and condensation follow.Anna Laetitia Barbauld and John Aikin, Evenings at Home; or, The Juvenile Budget Opened, 6 vols, 2nd ed. London: Printed for J. Johnson (1794) 2: p. 69. The text also emphasises rationality: in \\"Things by Their Right Names,\\" a child demands that his father tell him a story about \\"a bloody murder.\\" The father does so, using some of the fictional tropes of fairy tales such as \\"once upon a time\\", but confounding his son with details, such as the murderers all \\"had steel caps on.\\" In the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle, and his father comments \\"I do not know of any murders half so bloody.\\"Barbauld and Aikin, 1: pp. 150‚Äì152. Both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally, along with the anti-war message of this tale, prevail throughout Evenings at Home. In fact, Michelle Levy, a scholar of the period, argued that the series encouraged readers to \\"become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to authority.\\"Levy, Michelle. \\"The Radical Education of Evenings at Home.\\" Eighteenth-Century Fiction 19.1‚Äì2 (2006‚Äì07), p. 123. This resistance is learned and practised in the home; according to Levy, \\"Evenings at Home... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family.\\"Levy, p. 127. It is families that are responsible for the nation's progress or regression. According to Lucy Aikin, Barbauld's niece, Barbauld's contributions to Evenings at Home consisted of the following pieces: \\"The Young Mouse,\\" \\"The Wasp and Bee,\\" \\"Alfred, a drama,\\" \\"Animals and Countries,\\" \\"Canute's Reproof,\\" \\"The Masque of Nature,\\" \\"Things by their right Names,\\" \\"The Goose and Horse,\\" \\"On Manufactures,\\" \\"The Flying-fish,\\" \\"A Lesson in the Art of Distinguishing,\\" \\"The Phoenix and Dove,\\" \\"The Manufacture of Paper,\\" \\"The Four Sisters,\\" and \\"Live Dolls.\\"Aikin, Lucy. \\"Memoir.\\" The Works of Anna Laetitia Barbauld. 2 vols. London: Routledge (1996), pp. xxxvi‚Äìxxxvii. =Editorial work= Barbauld edited several major works towards the end of her life, all of which helped to shape the canon as known today. First, in 1804, she edited Samuel Richardson's correspondence and wrote an extensive biographical introduction of the man who was perhaps the most influential novelist of the 18th century. Her \\"212-page essay on his life and works [was] the first substantial Richardson biography.\\"McCarthy and Kraft, p. 360. The following year she edited Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder, with a Preliminary Essay, a volume of essays emphasising \\"wit\\", \\"manners\\" and \\"taste\\".Anna Barbauld, \\"Introduction.\\" Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder, with a Preliminary Essay. Quoted in 14 February 2007. In 1811, she assembled The Female Speaker, an anthology of literature chosen specifically for young girls. Because, according to Barbauld's philosophy, what one reads when one is young is formative, she carefully considered the \\"delicacy\\" of her female readers and \\"direct[ed] her choice to subjects more particularly appropriate to the duties, the employments, and the dispositions of the softer sex.\\"Anna Laetitia Barbauld, The Female Speaker; or, Miscellaneous Pieces, in Prose and Verse, Selected from the Best Writers, and Adapted to the Use of Young Women. 2nd ed. London: Printed for Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, etc. (1816), p. vi. The anthology is subdivided into sections such as \\"moral and didactic pieces\\" and \\"descriptive and pathetic pieces\\"; it includes poetry and prose by, among others, Alexander Pope, Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, Samuel Johnson, James Thomson and Hester Chapone. Barbauld's 50-volume series of The British Novelists, published in 1810 with a broad introductory essay on the history of the novel, allowed her to place her mark on literary history. It was \\"the first English edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims\\" and was in every respect \\"a canon-making enterprise\\".McCarthy and Kraft, p. 375. In an insightful essay, Barbauld legitimises the novel, then still a controversial genre, by connecting it to ancient Persian and Greek literature. For her, a good novel is \\"an epic in prose, with more of character and less (indeed in modern novels nothing) of the supernatural machinery.\\"Barbauld, Anna Laetitia. The British Novelists; with An Essay; and Prefaces, Biographical and Critical, by Mrs. Barbauld. London: Printed for F. C. and J. Rivington, [etc.] (1810), p. 3. Barbauld maintains that novel-reading has a multiplicity of benefits. Not only is it a \\"domestic pleasure\\", but it is also a way to \\"infus[e] principles and moral feelings\\" into the population.Barbauld, The British Novelists, pp. 47‚Äì48. Barbauld also provided introductions to each of the fifty authors included in the series.

Current The Dominion was home to the long-running musical We Will Rock You played at the theatre from 14 May 2002 until 31 May 2014. It was also home to the London auditions of Britain's Got Talent and from February to April 2016 to War of the Worlds. Over several years, the theatre has undergone a rolling programme of refurbishment which has included reclaiming the area above the main foyer as a studio for rehearsals or events (2008), and reclaiming the offices in Nederlander House, which were originally part of the theatre but had been rented as commercial office space. Within this area, originally listed on the theatre plans as a 'Boardroom', a new Boardroom space has been created (2011). Following the closure of We Will Rock You, the theatre remained dark for 15 weeks, during which time owners undertook a mass programme of refurbishment, including replacing carpets, painting and restoring architectural features, refurbishing seats, renovating the 'front of house' toilets and bars, and updating much of the backstage facilities, including the flying system. This ¬£6 million restoration programme was completed in 2017 with the unveiling of a brand new double-sided LED screen, the largest and highest resolution projecting screen on the exterior of a West End theatre. Since re-opening on 16 September 2014, the Dominion Theatre has been home to a number of short run musicals and spectaculars, including Evita (September 2014), White Christmas (November 2014), Lord of the Dance (March 2015) and the London premiere of Elf (October 2015). Between March 2017 ‚Äì January 2018, the Dominion Theatre was home to An American in Paris. In addition to hosting musicals in recent years, the theatre has also hosted a number of regular charity events, including MADTrust's West End Eurovision (2012, 2013, 2014) and West End Heroes (2013, 2014, 2015). 'West End Heroes' was produced by the theatre and brought together stars from current West End Shows, with musicians, from all the armed forces. The second event, in 2014, was hosted by Michael Ball. The Dominion is also currently home to Hillsong Church every Sunday. Construction and restoration The restored facade, as seen in 2017, illuminated at night. Construction of The Dominion began in March 1928 with a design by W and TR Milburn and a budget of ¬£460,000. The site was the location of the former Horse Shoe Brewery, which was the site of the 1814 London Beer Flood. The first performance was 3 October 1929. The Tottenham Court Road fa√ßade features a ground level entry sheltered by a broad marquee with the second through fourth levels framed by large pilasters. The central portion is concave and faced with Portland stone. A three-bay bow window extends the height of the second and third storeys and is surmounted by sculpture of two griffins. Behind the griffin statue are three square openings which hold decorative iron grates. The griffins were removed in 1932 to mount an aeroplane for the musical Silver Wings. The remainder of the bow window was hidden during the run of We Will Rock You by a large shimmer curtain and statue of Freddie Mercury. These elements were reinstalled as part of the restoration. In addition to restoring the Tottenham Court Road fa√ßade, the stonework and windows of the dressing room block at the rear of the theatre were cleaned and replaced. When the Dominion was built, it was linked to the building on Great Russell Street now known as Nederlander House. This building had been separated from the theatre and rented as office space for many decades. In 2011, the Dominion spent ¬£200K reinstating the connection between the theatre, with this building returning its use to that the original theatre builders intended. It is now home to the theatre management offices plus a refurbished Boardroom space on the top floor. This Boardroom is marked as such on the original 1929 plans and it is now being hired out by the theatre's Dominion Events department for meeting, training and conference bookings. Other areas above the main foyer, which the Rank Organisation converted to office space, have been restored and now house 'The Studio' a rehearsal and audition space. The auditorium currently has a seating capacity of 2,069 in two tiers of galleries, down from the 1940 capacity of 2,858 following the closure many decades ago of the upper circle. The theatre retains its 1920s light fittings and art deco plasterwork. History After initial success, including the London premiere of Charlie Chaplin's City Lights in February 1931, with Chaplin himself attending, the theatre began a financial slide until the company was liquidated 30 May 1932. In 1933, Associated Provincial Picture Houses assumed control of the facility and adapted the auditorium for films. In 1940, Associated became part of the Rank Organisation. The Dominion temporarily closed because of the Blitz early in October 1940 and reopened on 12 January 1941. After World War II, the theatre hosted both movies and live shows. Bill Haley and the Comets opened their UK tour at the Dominion in February 1957. Its first major live show was The Judy Garland Show which ran for a month in 1957 and it has been a popular venue for musical theatre since. Soon after, the theatre received a Todd-AO system with two Philips 70mm / 35mm projectors and a wide screen. The film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific opened 21 April 1958 and played four years and 22 weeks grossing $3.9 million. In 1963, Elizabeth Taylor appeared at the European opening of Cleopatra which played for almost two years. On 29 March 1965 the film The Sound of Music was screened here until 29 June 1968, the longest run of screenings of the film at any venue in the world. The re- release of David Lean's 1962 Lawrence of Arabia had its screening here from 11 September 1970. During the 1980s, it became a popular venue for music concerts. It was where Tangerine Dream recorded the album Logos in 1982, which contains a tribute tune called \\"Dominion\\". Dolly Parton filmed her 1983 concert at the Dominion and released it as a television special, Dolly in London. Other performers to appear during this era included Duran Duran, Adam and The Ants, Billy Bragg, Bon Jovi, The Boomtown Rats, Boy George, David Bowie, Ian Drury and the Blockheads, Manfred Mann, Sinead O‚ÄôConnor, Thin Lizzy, U2 and Van Morrison. In 1986, the Dominion hosted the musical Time, whose producers altered the interior extensively to accommodate the production. Since the early 1990s the Dominion has hosted several musicals including a new production of Grease by David Ian and Paul Nicholas, Scrooge: The Musical, Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, Disney's Beauty and the Beast, a return of Grease, and Notre Dame de Paris. In 2002, the hit stage musical We Will Rock You, based on the songs of Queen, created by Queen guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor together with British comedian Ben Elton opened. The show was scheduled to close in October 2006 before embarking on a UK tour, but due to popular demand was extended indefinitely. Statue of Freddie Mercury at the Dominion Theatre where Queen and Ben Elton's musical We Will Rock You was performed from 2002 to 2014In 2012, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of We Will Rock You, the theatre created the Freddie Mercury Suite, which displays pictures from the Queen singer's lifetime. This area was previously housed memorabilia of Judy Garland. In March 2014, producers announced that We Will Rock You would close on 31 May 2014. The Theatre played host to a \\"re- imagined\\" production of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version Of The War Of The Worlds from February to April 2016 and featured direction by Bob Thompson, an onstage orchestra conducted by Jeff Wayne and Liam Neeson as the Journalist in 3D holography. The Dominion hosted the Royal Variety Performance 1992 through 1996 and in 2000 and 2001. Ownership The Dominion has had a variety of owners during its history. The Rank Organisation and Apollo Leisure operated it from 1988 to 1999. In 1999, SFX Entertainment acquired Apollo Leisure and in 2001 Clear Channel Entertainment, part of the US based multinational, purchased SFX. Clear Channel spun-off its venues as Live Nation UK who operated Clear Channel's venues on behalf of the Nederlander Organization. On 23 October 2009 the Nederlander Organization took full control of the venue, purchasing Live Nation's portion of ownership.

The hills of Hampstead and Highgate, not visible from street level, can be seen on the horizon. Tottenham Court Road (occasionally abbreviated as TCR) is a major road in Central London, almost entirely within the London Borough of Camden. The road runs from Euston Road in the north to St Giles Circus in the south; Tottenham Court Road tube station lies just beyond the southern end of the road. Historically a market street, it became well known for selling electronics and white goods in the 20th century. The street takes its name from the Manor (estate) of Tottenham Court, whose lands lay toward the north and west of the road, in the parish of St Pancras. Tottenham Court was not directly connected to the district of Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey. Geography Tottenham Court Road looking south to Centre Point Tottenham Court Road runs from Euston Road in the north, to St Giles Circus (the junction of Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road) at its southern end. The road lies almost entirely within the London Borough of Camden near its boundary with the City of Westminster, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km). South of Torrington Place (originally Francis Street) the road marks the traditional boundary of the parishes of St Pancras (of which the manor of Tottenham Court was part) to the west, and St Giles to the east (Due to long-standing shared administrative arrangements, St Giles is often described as a part of Bloomsbury). North of Torrington Place both sides of the road are in St Pancras. The term Fitzrovia was first coined in the late 1930s as an informal description for some of the surrounding area. Tottenham Court Road is sometimes used to distinguish Fitzrovia to the west from Bloomsbury to the east (St Giles often being thought of as part of Bloomsbury). Fitzrovia has never had any formal limits applied, and its informal extent is sometimes also said to extend further east to Gower Street, thus potentially overlapping with the more formal definitions applied to St Giles and Bloomsbury. The south end of the road is close to the British Museum and to Centre Point, the West End's tallest building. There are a number of buildings belonging to University College London along the road, and University College Hospital is near the north end of the road. History The origin of the road's name is that it is the road to the Manor of Tottenham Court. The manor house lay just to the north of the roads junction with Euston Road. =Manor of Tottenham Court= The first surviving record of the manor is from a charter from around AD 1000.Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, Eilert Ekwall, 4th edition The manor was subsequently described as Totehele in the Domesday Book of 1086. The area was described as Totenhale in 1184 and Totenhale Court by 1487. Although the road's name has a similar word root to Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey, the two are not directly related. The manor house of Toten Hall, circa 1813 The Manor occupied the south-western part of the parish of St Pancras, whose boundaries are now used to delineate most of the south-west of the wider modern London Borough of Camden, of which St Pancras is the principle component. South of Torrington Place, Tottenham Court (and therefore St Pancras) lay between Tottenham Court Road and what is now the borough boundary with the City of Westminster. North of Torrington Place Tottenham Court (and hence also St Pancras) occupied both the east and west sides of the road. The manor house lay just to the north of what is now Euston Road (which wasn't built until 1756). The manor is mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral. In the time of Henry III (1216‚Äì1272), a manor house slightly north-west of what is now the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Euston Road belonged to one William de Tottenhall. In about the 15th century, the area was known variously as Totten, Totham, or Totting Hall. After changing hands several times, the manor was leased for 99 years to Queen Elizabeth, and it came to be popularly called Tottenham Court. In 1639, the land was leased to Charles I until his execution ten years later, when it was sold to Ralph Harrison. It regained Crown ownership upon the Restoration of the Monarchy, where it was given a 41-year lease to Charles II. =Urbanisation= The manor became the property of the Fitzroys, who built Fitzroy Square on a part of the manor estate towards the end of the 18th century. There was a manor house at the northwest end of the road, this subsequently became the Adam and Eve pub. This was demolished to build the Euston Tower. Tottenham Court Road had become a place of entertainment by the mid-17th century. In 1645, three people were fined for drinking on a Sunday. A Gooseberry Fair was held sporadically throughout the century, and featured numerous booths with street entertainers. The Horse Shoe Brewery was established in 1764 on the junction of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. The current Horseshoe pub was built in the 19th century. Whitefield's Tabernacle was built in 1756 for the Reverend George Whitefield, and subsequently became the world's largest Methodist church after it was extended in 1760. It was rebuilt in 1857 after being destroyed by fire, and again in 1888 after the building collapsed. It was bombed during World War II and rebuilt as the Memorial Chapel. Tottenham Court Road was predominantly rural in nature until well into the 19th century. When Heal's was established on former farmland, the lease stipulated there must be appropriate accommodation for 40 cows. These cowsheds were destroyed in a fire in 1877. A 17th century farmhouse at the rear of No. 196 Tottenham Court Road was demolished in 1917. =Fairyland shooting range= Fairyland, 92 Tottenham Court Road circa 1905 During the period leading up to and during World War I, a shooting range called Fairyland was at No. 92 Tottenham Court Road. In 1909, Madan Lal Dhingra practised shooting here prior to his assassination of Sir William Hutt Curzon Wyllie. Other residents of India House and members of Abhinav Bharat practised shooting at the range and rehearsed assassinations they planned to carry out. Also in 1909 it was reported in a police investigation that the range was being used by two Suffragettes in a possible conspiracy to assassinate prime minister H. H. Asquith. It was also where Donald Lesbini shot Alice Eliza Storey. R v Lesbini (1914) was a case that established in British, Canadian and Australian law that, with regard to voluntary manslaughter, a reasonable man always has reasonable powers of self-control and is never intoxicated. The shooting range was owned and run by Henry Stanton Morley (1875-1916). Transport The road was, for many years, a one- way street: all three lanes were northbound only; the corresponding southbound traffic used the parallel Gower Street, to the east. The road is served by three stations on the London Underground‚Äîfrom south to north these are Tottenham Court Road, Goodge Street and Warren Street‚Äîand by numerous bus routes. When it opens, the Elizabeth line is expected to increase passenger traffic at Tottenham Court Road station by 40 percent. On 3 June 2014 Camden Council announced plans to reserve the road for buses and bicycles only, during daylight hours from Monday to Saturday. The council claimed it would make the street safer and boost business ahead of the opening of the new Crossrail station. The current one-way system would be replaced with two-way traffic flows. Wider pavements, cycle lanes and safer pedestrian crossings would also be installed as part of the ¬£26m plan. As of Spring 2019, Tottenham Court Road has been 2-way, with buses, cycles and motorbikes permitted to use the southbound road towards the junction towards (New) Oxford Street. Economy =Entertainment= The Dominion Theatre opened in 1929, on the site of the old Horseshoe Brewery on Tottenham Court Road. It became a cinema in 1932, before reverting to being a theatre. It has a capacity of 2,000. =Retail= Tottenham Court Road looking north with the Euston Tower in the distance Tottenham Court Road is a significant shopping street, best known for its high concentration of consumer electronics shops, which range from shops specialising in cables and computer components to those dealing in package computers and audio-video systems. Further north there are several furniture shops, including Habitat and Heal's. Another well-known store was the furniture maker Maple & Co. In the 1950s and 1960s, Tottenham Court Road and a few of the adjoining streets became well known for stores selling World War II surplus radio and electronics equipment and all kinds of electro-mechanical and radio parts. Shops such as Proops Brothers (established in 1946) lined both sides of the road at that time. By the 1960s they were also selling Japanese transistor radios, audio mixers and other electronic gadgets. Many British-made valve stereos were offered too. In the early twenty-first century, the growth of e-commerce has reduced the importance of electronics retailing in the area, and cafes and fashion stores like Primark have become more prevalent. Whilst Tottenham Court Road still has some specialist furniture and electronics retailers, it is becoming more of a general business district. However, some of the original electronics stores on Tottenham Court Road still trade, such as House of Computers, well-known in the area for offering a range of computers and accessories. Whitfield Gardens Opposite Habitat and Heal's is a small public open space called Whitfield Gardens, built on the former site of a chapel. On the side of a house is a painting, the \\"Fitzrovia Mural\\", which is about 20 metres (over 60 feet) high and shows many people at work and at leisure. It was painted in 1980 in a style resembling that of Diego Rivera. The mural has suffered from neglect and has been daubed with graffiti. There is a proposal to restore the mural after the current works to renovate the gardens are completed.Mural could return to its former grace , News Reporters, 6 September 2010, Fitzrovia News, accessed 20 September 2010Iconic London mural could be restored, Wikinews, 20 September 2010 accessed 20 September 2010 In 2005, 12 so-called \\"Our Glass\\" panels were erected in the gardens. Each is about five feet (1.5 m) high, with two sides showing a collage of people associated with the area, from satirical cartoonist Hogarth to the popular singer Boy George. There is a 13th panel showing an index of the people depicted. In popular culture =Art= William Hogarth's painting The March of the Guards to Finchley is set outside the Adam and Eve at the northwest end of Tottenham Court Road. =Music= Pink Floyd played many early concerts at the UFO Club at 31 Tottenham Court Road where they were the house band.\\"Syd Barrett\\" (obituary), Daily Telegraph, London, 12 July 2006. The road is referred to in the lyrics of Underworld's Born Slippy .NUXX. The Kinks reference the road in their song Denmark Street (1970). The Pogues mention Tottenham Court Road in the song Transmetropolitan (1984), written by Shane MacGowan. David Gray references Tottenham Court Road in the song Everytime on his 1996 album Sell, Sell, Sell. =Books= Tottenham Court Road is mentioned in many works of fiction. It is featured briefly in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling when Harry and his friends are escaping from Death Eaters; in The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins; in Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf; in Postern of Fate by Agatha Christie; in Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw and its musical adaptation, My Fair Lady; in Saturday and Atonement by Ian McEwan; in several Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; in the Saki story Reginald on Christmas Presents; several stories by John Collier; in A Room with a View by E.M. Forster; in The London Eye Mystery by Siobhan Dowd; in The Late Mr Elvesham and The Invisible ManThe Invisible Man, Chapter 21 and 22 by H. G. Wells; in The Wish House by Celia Rees; in the short story Rumpole and the Judge's Elbow from the book Rumpole's Last Case by John Mortimer; in a The Matrix-based story, Goliath, by Neil Gaiman. It features often in novels by Mark Billingham and in The Lonely Londoners by Sam Selvon. Sherlock Holmes once said that he purchased his Stradivarius from \\"a Jew broker in the Tottenham Court Road.\\" =Films= It is mentioned briefly as the location where 'I' was allegedly arrested for 'toilet trading' in the 1986 Bruce Robinson cult-classic movie Withnail and I. Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Freddy's mother, lives in Tottenham Court Road, according to Professor Henry Higgins (My Fair Lady). Also it is where one person becomes victim to the werewolf's rampage in An American Werewolf In London. =Musicals= In the Lerner-Loewe musical My Fair Lady, Tottenham Court Road is mentioned as the place where Eliza Doolittle sells her flowers. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats references the area in the song Grizabella the Glamour Cat, the lyrics coming from an unpublished poem fragment by T. S. Eliot. Tottenham Court Road station was replicated as part of the set for the Queen musical We Will Rock You, which played at the Dominion Theatre between 2002 and 2014, directly above the actual Underground station.

She also published under pseudonyms such as Mary Godolphin. Her literary-minded family included her aunt Anna Laetitia Barbauld, a writer of poetry, essays and children's books. Early life Born at Warrington, then Lancashire, in 1781, Aikin was the fourth child of a physician, John Aikin (1747‚Äì1822), and his wife, Martha Jennings (died 1830).Barbara Brandon Schnorrenberg, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 Retrieved 6 November 2018. Theirs was a literary family of prominent Unitarians. Lucy's father was also a historian, and her grandfather, likewise called John Aikin (1713‚Äì1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with Warrington Academy. Lucy's aunt was Anna Laetitia Barbauld, a prominent children's writer, while her brother Arthur Aikin (1773‚Äì1854) was a chemist, mineralogist and scientific writer, and their brother Charles Rochemont (1775‚Äì1847) was adopted by Barbauld and became a doctor and chemist. Another brother, the architect Edmund Aikin (1780‚Äì1820), wrote influential works about architecture. Lucy Aikin lived with her parents in Great Yarmouth and Stoke Newington until the death of her father in 1822, when she moved to Hampstead. There, apart from a short interval in Wimbledon, she spent the remainder of her life. She briefly attended a day school in Yarmouth, but was largely educated privately by her father and her aunt, an early critic of the education system. She \\"read widely in English, French, Italian, and Latin literature and history,\\" began publishing for magazines at the age of 17, and was soon assisting her father as an editor of his writings. Works Aikin's works delve into the artistic, social, and literary sides of her period, rather than its religious, military or parliamentary history. In 1810 appeared her first considerable work, Epistles on Women, Exemplifying their Character and Condition in Various Ages and Nations, with Miscellaneous Poems, and in 1814 her only work of fiction, entitled Lorimer, a Tale. Those were just early efforts, but her reputation was gained wholly by historical works published between 1818 and 1843: Memoirs of the Court of Queen Elizabeth (1818); Memoirs of the Court of James I. (1822); Memoirs of the Court of Charles I. (1833); and the Life of Addison (1843). The last of these, containing many letters of Addison never before published, was the subject of an essay by Macaulay, who while praising Aikin's other works, and especially her Memoirs of the Court of James I, observed that she was \\"far more at home among the ruffs and peaked beards of Theobalds than among the steenkirks and flowing periwigs which surrounded Queen Anne's tea table at Hampton.\\" Of her other memoirs, she herself wrote on completing her Charles I, \\"I am resolved against proceeding farther with English sovereigns. Charles II is no theme for me: it would make me condemn my species.\\" Aikin also wrote a life of her father, and of her aunt, Mrs Barbauld, and many minor pieces. Like Barbauld, Aikin was interested in early education, and as such published several works to assist young readers: Poetry for Children: Consisting of Short Pieces to be Committed to Memory (1801), Juvenile Correspondence or Letters, Designed as Examples of the Epistolary Style, for Children of Both Sexes (1811), An English Lesson Book, for the Junior Classes (1828), and The Acts of Life: of Providing Food, of Providing Clothing, of Providing Shelter (1858). Under the pseudonym Mary Godolphin, Aikin also contributed as an editor to versions of Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson Crusoe, Swiss Family Robinson, Aesop's Fables, Evenings at Home (by her father and aunt), and Sandford and Merton written \\"in Words of One Syllable\\". Letters and translations Aikin's conversational powers were remarkable, and she was a graceful and graphic letter writer. Her letters to her relatives and intimate friends showed her relish for society, and were full of wit and lively anecdotes of distinguished literary persons. She maintained for almost 16 years (1826‚Äì1842) a graver correspondence with the Rev. Dr William Ellery Channing, an American Unitarian theologian in Boston, on religion, philosophy, politics, and literature. Aikin's letters were known for criticizing leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, and for criticisms of various authors, male and female. Her letters also showed an appreciation for classic and contemporary literature. Aikin also translated French texts: Louis Francois Jauffret's The Travels of Rolando (publication around 1804), and Jean Gaspard Hess's The Life of Ulrich Zwingli (1812), on a leader of the Reformation in Switzerland. Personal life Aikin never married or had children. She lived her whole life with family, notably her parents and her niece, although she did briefly live with her nephew in London. Politically Aikin was a staunch feminist and religiously a Unitarian. Death and legacy Lucy Aikin died of influenza in 1864 in Hampstead, then just north of London, where she had lived for 40 years. At the time of her death, Aikin had less than ‚Ç¨9,000. Her niece Anna Letitia Le Breton took over her literary legacy. Aikin's Memoirs, Miscellanies, and Letters were published in 1864, as was an edited version of her correspondence with Channing ten years later.

Lady Mary was considered to be the illegitimate child of the famous playwright William Congreve, with whom Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough, was having a long-term relationship. She was, however, recognised by Francis as his own daughter, and was raised by him with the other Godolphin children. Despite this, gossip spread rapidly about Lady Mary's paternity, and her maternal grandmother did not recognise her until 1740, when the two reconciled their differences. It was at this time that Sarah, Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, arranged Lady Mary's marriage to Thomas Osborne, 4th Duke of Leeds; they were married on 26 June 1740. They had one surviving child, Francis Godolphin Osborne (styled Marquess of Carmarthen, later 5th Duke of Leeds and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), who was born on 29 January 1751.

One of the first programs to run on the Mark I was initiated on 29 March 1944Bernard Cohen, p.164 (2000) by John von Neumann. At that time, von Neumann was working on the Manhattan Project, and needed to determine whether implosion was a viable choice to detonate the atomic bomb that would be used a year later. The Mark I also computed and printed mathematical tables, which had been the initial goal of British inventor Charles Babbage for his \\"analytical engine\\". The Mark I was disassembled in 1959, but portions of it are displayed in the Science Center as part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. Other sections of the original machine were transferred to IBM and the Smithsonian Institution. Origins The original concept was presented to IBM by Howard Aiken in November 1937.Bernard Cohen, p. 53 (2000) After a feasibility study by IBM engineers, the company chairman Thomas Watson Sr. personally approved the project and its funding in February 1939. Howard Aiken had started to look for a company to design and build his calculator in early 1937. After two rejections,Bernard Cohen, p.39 (2000) It was first rejected by the Monroe Calculator Company and then by Harvard University. he was shown a demonstration set that Charles Babbage‚Äôs son had given to Harvard University 70 years earlier. This led him to study Babbage and to add references of the Analytical Engine to his proposal; the resulting machine \\"brought Babbage‚Äôs principles of the Analytical Engine almost to full realization, while adding important new features.\\" The ASCC was developed and built by IBM at their Endicott plant and shipped to Harvard in February 1944. It began computations for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships in May and was officially presented to the university on August 7, 1944.

It used 765,000 electromechanical components and hundreds of miles of wire, comprising a volume of ‚Äì in length, in height, and deep. It weighed about .

It could do 3 additions or subtractions in a second. A multiplication took 6 seconds, a division took 15.3 seconds, and a logarithm or a trigonometric function took over one minute. The Mark I read its instructions from a 24-channel punched paper tape. It executed the current instruction and then read in the next one. A separate tape could contain numbers for input, but the tape formats were not interchangeable. Instructions could not be executed from the storage registers. This separation of data and instructions is known as the Harvard architecture (although the exact nature of this separation that makes a machine Harvard, rather than Von Neumann, has been obscured with the passage of time; see Modified Harvard architecture). Main sequence mechanism was unidirectional. This meant that complex programs had to be physically lengthy. A program loop was accomplished by loop unrolling or by joining the end of the paper tape containing the program back to the beginning of the tape (literally creating a loop). At first, conditional branching in the Mark I was performed manually. Later modifications in 1946 introduced automatic program branching (by subroutine call). ASCC operational manual, subsidiary sequence control, pp. 22, 50, 57, 73, 91 The first programmers of the Mark I were computing pioneers Richard Milton Bloch, Robert Campbell, and Grace Hopper.Wexelblat, Richard L. (Ed.) (1981). History of Programming Languages, p. 20. New York: Academic Press. There was also a small technical team whose purpose was to actually operate the machine, some of whom were IBM employees before being required to join the Navy to work on the machine. This technical team was not informed of the purpose of their work while at Harvard.

Each accumulator, each set of switches, and the registers associated with the input, output, and arithmetic units were assigned a unique identifying index number. These numbers were represented in binary on the control tape. The first field was the binary index of the result of the operation, the second was the source datum for the operation and the third field was a code for the operation to be performed. Contribution to the Manhattan Project In 1928 L.J. Comrie was the first to turn IBM \\"punched-card equipment to scientific use: computation of astronomical tables by the method of finite differences, as envisioned by Babbage 100 years earlier for his Difference Engine\\". Very soon after, IBM started to modify its tabulators to facilitate this kind of computation. One of these tabulators, built in 1931, was The Columbia Difference Tabulator. John von Neumann had a team at Los Alamos that used \\"modified IBM punched-card machines\\"#AIKEN, Bernard Cohen p.166 (2000) to determine the effects of implosion. In March 1944, he proposed to run certain problems regarding implosion on the Mark I, and in 1944 he arrived with two mathematicians to write a simulation program to study the implosion of the first atomic bomb.Bernard Cohen, p. 164 (2000) > The Los Alamos group completed its work in a much shorter time than the > Cambridge group. However, the punched-card machine operation computed values > to six decimal places, whereas the Mark I computed values to eighteen > decimal places. Additionally, Mark I integrated the partial differential > equation at a much smaller interval size [or smaller mesh] and so...achieved > far greater precision. \\"Von Neumann joined the Manhattan Project in 1943, working on the immense number of calculations needed to build the atomic bomb. He showed that the implosion design, which would later be used in the Trinity and Fat Man bombs, was likely faster and more efficient than the gun design.\\" Aiken and IBM Aiken published a press release announcing the Mark I listing himself as the sole ‚Äúinventor‚Äù. James W. Bryce was the only IBM person mentioned, even though several IBM engineers including Clair Lake and Frank Hamilton had helped to build various elements. IBM chairman Thomas J. Watson was enraged, and only reluctantly attended the dedication ceremony on August 7, 1944. Aiken, in turn, decided to build further machines without IBM‚Äôs help, and the ASCC came to be generally known as the \\"Harvard Mark I\\". IBM went on to build its Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC) to both test new technology and provide more publicity for the company's own efforts. Successors The Mark I was followed by the Harvard Mark II (1947 or 1948), Mark III/ADEC (September 1949), and Harvard Mark IV (1952) ‚Äì all the work of Aiken. The Mark II was an improvement over the Mark I, although it still was based on electromechanical relays. The Mark III used mostly electronic components‚Äîvacuum tubes and crystal diodes‚Äîbut also included mechanical components: rotating magnetic drums for storage, plus relays for transferring data between drums. The Mark IV was all-electronic, replacing the remaining mechanical components with magnetic core memory. The Mark II and Mark III were delivered to the US Navy base at Dahlgren, Virginia. The Mark IV was built for the US Air Force, but it stayed at Harvard. The Mark I was disassembled in 1959, but portions of it are displayed in the Science Center, as part of the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. Other sections of the original machine were transferred to IBM and to the Smithsonian Institution.

It is one of the many oxidation reactions commonly referred to as 'activated DMSO' oxidations. The reaction is known for its mild character and wide tolerance of functional groups. The Swern oxidation. The by-products are dimethyl sulfide (Me2S), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and‚Äîwhen triethylamine is used as base‚Äîtriethylammonium chloride (Et3NHCl). Of the volatile by-products, dimethyl sulfide has a strong, pervasive odour and carbon monoxide is acutely toxic, so the reaction and the work-up needs to be performed in a fume hood. Dimethyl sulfide is a volatile liquid (B.P. 37 ¬∞C) with an unpleasant odour at high concentrations. Mechanism The first step of the Swern oxidation is the low-temperature reaction of DMSO, 1a, formally as resonance contributor 1b, with oxalyl chloride, 2. The first intermediate, 3, quickly decomposes giving off carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and producing chloro(dimethyl)sulfonium chloride, 4. Dimethylchlorosulfonium chloride formation. After addition of the alcohol 5, the chloro(dimethyl)sulfonium chloride 4 reacts with the alcohol to give the key alkoxysulfonium ion intermediate, 6. The addition of at least 2 equivalents of base ‚Äî typically triethylamine ‚Äî will deprotonate the alkoxysulfonium ion to give the sulfur ylide 7. In a five-membered ring transition state, the sulfur ylide 7 decomposes to give dimethyl sulfide and the desired carbonyl compound 8. The mechanism of the Swern oxidation. Variations When using oxalyl chloride as the dehydration agent, the reaction must be kept colder than ‚àí60 ¬∞C to avoid side reactions. With cyanuric chloride or trifluoroacetic anhydride instead of oxalyl chloride, the reaction can be warmed to ‚àí30 ¬∞C without side reactions. Other methods for the activation of DMSO to initiate the formation of the key intermediate 6 are the use of carbodiimides (Pfitzner‚ÄìMoffatt oxidation), a sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (Parikh‚ÄìDoering oxidation) or acetic anhydride (Albright-Goldman oxidation). The intermediate 4 can also be prepared from dimethyl sulfide and N-chlorosuccinimide (the Corey‚ÄìKim oxidation). In some cases, the use of triethylamine as the base can lead to epimerisation at the carbon alpha the newly formed carbonyl. Using a bulkier base, such as diisopropylethylamine, can mitigate this side reaction. Considerations Dimethyl sulfide, a byproduct of the Swern oxidation, is one of the strongest odours known in organic chemistry. Humans can detect this compound in concentrations as low as 0.02 to 0.1 parts per million. A simple remedy for this problem is to rinse used glassware with bleach or oxone solution, which will oxidize the dimethyl sulfide back to dimethyl sulfoxide or to dimethyl sulfone, both of which are odourless and nontoxic. The reaction conditions allow oxidation of acid- sensitive compounds, which might decompose under the acidic oxidation conditions such as Jones oxidation. For example, in Thompson & Heathcock's synthesis of the sesquiterpene isovelleral, the final step uses the Swern protocol, avoiding rearrangement of the acid-sensitive cyclopropanemethanol moiety. center See also * Alcohol oxidation * Sulfonium-based oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes * Pyridinium chlorochromate * Jones oxidation * Oppenauer oxidation * Pfitzner‚ÄìMoffatt oxidation * Parikh‚ÄìDoering oxidation * Albright-Goldman oxidation * Corey‚ÄìKim oxidation * Dess‚ÄìMartin periodinane oxidation * Ley oxidation (TPAP oxidation) * TEMPO oxidation References External links * Organic Chemistry Portal Organic oxidation reactions Name reactions ","title":"Swern oxidation"},{"id":"173874","text":"Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) is random-access memory that retains data without applied power. This is in contrast to dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and static random-access memory (SRAM), which both maintain data only for as long as power is applied, or such forms of memory as magnetic tape, which cannot be randomly accessed but which retains data indefinitely without electric power. Read-only memory devices can be used to store system firmware in embedded systems such as an automotive ignition system control or home appliance. They are also used to hold the initial processor instructions required to bootstrap a computer system. Read-write memory can be used to store calibration constants, passwords, or setup information, and may be integrated into a microcontroller. If the main memory of a computer system were non-volatile, it would greatly reduce the time required to start a system after a power interruption. Current existing types of semiconductor non- volatile memory have limitations in memory size, power consumption, or operating life that make them impractical for main memory. Development is going on for the use of non-volatile memory chips as a system's main memory, as persistent memory. Known as NVDIMM-P, it is expected to be released in 2020. Early NVRAMs Early computers used core and drum memory systems which were non-volatile as a byproduct of their construction. The most common form of memory through the 1960s was magnetic-core memory, which stored data in the polarity of small magnets. Since the magnets held their state even with the power removed, core memory was also non-volatile. Other memory types required constant power to retain data, such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops, Williams tubes, and semiconductor memory (static or dynamic RAM). Advances in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s led to a new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory could not match on cost or density. Today dynamic RAM forms the vast majority of a typical computer's main memory. Many systems require at least some non-volatile memory. Desktop computers require permanent storage of the instructions required to load the operating system. Embedded systems, such as an engine control computer for a car, must retain their instructions when power is removed. Many systems used a combination of RAM and some form of ROM for these roles. Custom ROM integrated circuits were one solution. The memory contents were stored as a pattern of the last mask used for manufacturing the integrated circuit, and so could not be modified once completed. PROM improved on this design, allowing the chip to be written electrically by the end-user. PROM consists of a series of diodes that are initially all set to a single value, \\"1\\" for instance. By applying higher power than normal, a selected diode can be \\"burned out\\" (like a fuse), thereby permanently setting that bit to \\"0\\". PROM facilitated prototyping and small volume manufacturing. Many semiconductor manufacturers provided a PROM version of their mask ROM part, so that development firmware could be tested before ordering a mask ROM. Currently, the best-known form of both NV-RAM and EEPROM memory is flash memory. Some drawbacks to flash memory include the requirement to write it in larger blocks than many computers can automatically address, and the relatively limited longevity of flash memory due to its finite number of write-erase cycles (as of January 2010 most consumer flash products can withstand only around 100,000 rewrites before memory begins to deteriorate). Another drawback is the performance limitations preventing flash from matching the response times and, in some cases, the random addressability offered by traditional forms of RAM. Several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles, and some even claim to be a truly universal memory, offering the performance of the best SRAM devices with the non-volatility of flash.\\"A Survey Of Architectural Approaches for Managing Embedded DRAM and Non-volatile On-chip Caches\\", Mittal et al., IEEE TPDS, 2014. As of June 2018 these alternatives have not yet become mainstream. Those who required real RAM-like performance and non-volatility typically have had to use conventional RAM devices and a battery backup. For example, IBM PC's and successors beginning with the IBM PC AT used nonvolatile BIOS memory, often called CMOS RAM or parameter RAM, and this was a common solution in other early microcomputer systems like the original Apple Macintosh, which used a small amount of memory powered by a battery for storing basic setup information like the selected boot volume. (The original IBM PC and PC XT instead used DIP switches to represent up to 24 bits of system configuration data; DIP or similar switches are another, primitive type of programmable ROM device that was widely used in the 1970s and 1980s for very small amounts of data-- typically no more than 8 bytes.) Before industry standardization on the IBM PC architecture, some other microcomputer models used battery-backed RAM more extensively: for example, in the TRS-80 Model 100/Tandy 102, all of the main memory (8 KB minimum, 32 KB maximum) is battery-backed SRAM. Also, in the 1990s many video game software cartridges (e.g. for consoles such as the Sega Genesis) included battery-backed RAM to retain saved games, high scores, and similar data. Also, some arcade video game cabinets contain CPU modules that include battery-backed RAM containing keys for on-the-fly game software decryption. Much larger battery backed memories are still used today as caches for high-speed databases that require a performance level newer NVRAM devices have not yet managed to meet. Floating-gate MOSFET A huge advance in NVRAM technology was the introduction of the floating-gate MOSFET transistor, which led to the introduction of erasable programmable read-only memory, or EPROM. EPROM consists of a grid of transistors whose gate terminal (the \\"switch\\") is protected by a high-quality insulator. By \\"pushing\\" electrons onto the base with the application of higher-than-normal voltage, the electrons become trapped on the far side of the insulator, thereby permanently switching the transistor \\"on\\" (\\"1\\"). EPROM can be re-set to the \\"base state\\" (all \\"1\\"s or \\"0\\"s, depending on the design) by applying ultraviolet light (UV). The UV photons have enough energy to push the electrons through the insulator and return the base to a ground state. At that point the EPROM can be re-written from scratch. An improvement on EPROM, EEPROM, soon followed. The extra \\"E\\" stands for electrically, referring to the ability to reset EEPROM using electricity instead of UV, making the devices much easier to use in practice. The bits are re-set with the application of even higher power through the other terminals of the transistor (source and drain). This high power pulse, in effect, sucks the electrons through the insulator, returning it to the ground state. This process has the disadvantage of mechanically degrading the chip, however, so memory systems based on floating-gate transistors in general have short write-lifetimes, on the order of 105 writes to any particular bit. One approach to overcoming the rewrite count limitation is to have a standard SRAM where each bit is backed up by an EEPROM bit. In normal operation the chip functions as a fast SRAM and in case of power failure the content is quickly transferred to the EEPROM part, from where it gets loaded back at the next power up. Such chips were called NOVRAMs by their manufacturers. The basis of flash memory is identical to EEPROM, and differs largely in internal layout. Flash allows its memory to be written only in blocks, which greatly simplifies the internal wiring and allows for higher densities. Memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems, and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest cost solid-state memory devices available. Starting around 2000, demand for ever-greater quantities of flash have driven manufacturers to use only the latest fabrication systems in order to increase density as much as possible. Although fabrication limits are starting to come into play, new \\"multi-bit\\" techniques appear to be able to double or quadruple the density even at existing linewidths. Newer approaches Flash and EEPROM's limited write-cycles are a serious problem for any real RAM-like role, however. In addition, the high power needed to write the cells is a problem in low-power roles, where NVRAM is often used. The power also needs time to be \\"built up\\" in a device known as a charge pump, which makes writing dramatically slower than reading, often as much as 1,000 times. A number of new memory devices have been proposed to address these shortcomings. =Ferroelectric RAM= To date, the only such system to enter widespread production is ferroelectric RAM, or F-RAM (sometimes referred to as FeRAM). F-RAM is a random-access memory similar in construction to DRAM but (instead of a dielectric layer like in DRAM) contains a thin ferroelectric film of lead zirconate titanate [Pb(Zr,Ti)O3], commonly referred to as PZT. The Zr/Ti atoms in the PZT change polarity in an electric field, thereby producing a binary switch. Unlike RAM devices, F-RAM retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted, due to the PZT crystal maintaining polarity. Due to this crystal structure and how it is influenced, F-RAM offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory options, including extremely high endurance (exceeding 1016 access cycles for 3.3 V devices), ultra low power consumption (since F-RAM does not require a charge pump like other non- volatile memories), single-cycle write speeds, and gamma radiation tolerance. Ramtron International has developed, produced, and licensed ferroelectric RAM (F-RAM), and other companies that have licensed and produced F-RAM technology include Texas Instruments, Rohm, and Fujitsu. =Magnetoresistive RAM= Another approach to see major development effort is magnetoresistive random- access memory, or MRAM, which uses magnetic elements and in general operates in a fashion similar to core, at least for the first-generation technology. Only one MRAM chip has entered production to date: Everspin Technologies' 4 Mbit part, which is a first-generation MRAM that utilizes cross-point field induced writing. Two second-generation techniques are currently in development: Thermal Assisted Switching (TAS), which is being developed by Crocus Technology, and spin-transfer torque (STT) on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and several other companies are working. STT-MRAM appears to allow for much higher densities than those of the first generation, but is lagging behind flash for the same reasons as FeRAM - enormous competitive pressures in the flash market. =Phase-change RAM= Another solid-state technology to see more than purely experimental development is Phase-change RAM, or PRAM. PRAM is based on the same storage mechanism as writable CDs and DVDs, but reads them based on their changes in electrical resistance rather than changes in their optical properties. Considered a \\"dark horse\\" for some time, in 2006 Samsung announced the availability of a 512 Mbit part, considerably higher capacity than either MRAM or FeRAM. The areal density of these parts appears to be even higher than modern flash devices, the lower overall storage being due to the lack of multi-bit encoding. This announcement was followed by one from Intel and STMicroelectronics, who demonstrated their own PRAM devices at the 2006 Intel Developer Forum in October. Intel and STMicroelectronics are now selling PRAM based devices to consumers, under the names 3D XPoint Optane, and QuantX. =Millipede memory= Perhaps one of the more innovative solutions is millipede memory, developed by IBM. Millipede is in essence a punched card rendered using nanotechnology in order to dramatically increase areal density. Although it was planned to introduce Millipede as early as 2003, unexpected problems in development delayed this until 2005, by which point it was no longer competitive with flash. In theory the technology offers storage densities on the order of 1 Tbit/in¬≤ (‚âà394 Gbit/cm¬≤), greater than even the best hard drive technologies currently in use (perpendicular recording offers 636 Gbit/in¬≤ (‚âà250.4 Gbit/cm¬≤) as of Dec. 2011), but future heat-assisted magnetic recording and patterned media together could support densities of 10 Tbit/in¬≤ (‚âà3.95 Tbit/cm¬≤). However, slow read and write times for memories this large seem to limit this technology to hard drive replacements as opposed to high-speed RAM-like uses, although to a very large degree the same is true of flash as well. =FeFET memory= An alternative application of (hafnium oxide based) ferroelectrics is Fe FET based memory, which utilises a ferroelectric between the gate and device of a field-effect transistor. Such devices are claimed to have the advantage that the utilise the same technology as HKMG (high-L metal gate) based lithography, and scale to the same size as a conventional FET at a given process node. As of 2017 32Mbit devices have been demonstrated at 22 nm. =Others= A number of more esoteric devices have been proposed, including Nano-RAM based on carbon nanotube technology, but these are currently far from commercialization. The advantages that nanostructures such as quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and nanowires offer over their silicon-based predecessors include their tiny size, speed and their density. Several concepts of molecular-scale memory devices have been developed recently. Research has also been done in designing racetrack memory, also called domain wall memory. Also seeing renewed interest is silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) memory.

This algorithm has an exponential search time to find the optimal next move, so general methods for speeding it up are very useful. Barbara Liskov created the general heuristic to speed tree search in a computer program to play chess endgames for her Ph.D. thesis. Alpha-beta pruning works best when the best moves are considered first. This is because the best moves are the ones most likely to produce a cutoff, a condition where the game playing program knows that the position it is considering could not possibly have resulted from best play by both sides and so need not be considered further. I.e. the game playing program will always make its best available move for each position. It only needs to consider the other player's possible responses to that best move, and can skip evaluation of responses to (worse) moves it will not make. The killer heuristic attempts to produce a cutoff by assuming that a move that produced a cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely to produce a cutoff in the present position, that is to say that a move that was a very good move from a different (but possibly similar) position might also be a good move in the present position. By trying the killer move before other moves, a game playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal moves from a position. In practical implementation, game playing programs frequently keep track of two killer moves for each depth of the game tree (greater than depth of 1) and see if either of these moves, if legal, produces a cutoff before the program generates and considers the rest of the possible moves. If a non-killer move produces a cutoff, it replaces one of the two killer moves at its depth. This idea can be generalized into a set of refutation tables. A generalization of the killer heuristic is the history heuristic. The history heuristic can be implemented as a table that is indexed by some characteristic of the move, for example \\"from\\" and \\"to\\" squares or piece moving and the \\"to\\" square. When there is a cutoff, the appropriate entry in the table is incremented, such as by adding d¬≤ or 2d where d is the current search depth. This information is used when ordering moves.

Major tributaries include the Vorma River, which drains Lake Mj√∏sa, joining the Glomma River at √Örnes in Nes. The L√•gen drains into Lake Mj√∏sa, collecting drainage from the large Gudbrandsdalen and significantly increasing the Glomma's flow. Because it flows through some of the richest forest districts, it has historically been Norway's leading log-floating river. The combination of raw materials, water power, and easy transport has over the centuries encouraged industry along the Glomma. Some of the country's largest manufacturing and processing concerns are found around its mouth, where supplies of timber and hydropower have been backed by excellent port facilities. The Vorma, a major tributary, flows into the Glomma just north of √Örnes The upper limit of the Glomma valley farms is variable, but typically runs about in √òsterdalen, slightly lower than in the Gudbrandsdalen, which reflects the colder climate. The treeline, with a light birch forest, rises to about in √òsterdalen. Above R√∏ros the forest is restricted to the valley floor. The upper river valleys of Norwegian rivers have distinctive names which are vestiges of earlier cultural distinctions such as building styles, traditional clothing or bunad and domestic crafts. The upper valley of the Glomma is the √òsterdal (or East Valley). Upon entering Lake √òyeren at Fetsund, the Glomma has formed Europe's largest inland delta which reaches the opposite side of the lake, across its short axis. Some of the vast amount of silt that the Glomma deposits in Lake √òyeren is extracted to manufacture LECA building blocks widely used for in the construction of foundations in Norway. Name The form Glomma is used in √òstfold and Akershus counties, while in Innlandet and Tr√∏ndelag counties the river is called (and written) Gl√•ma.

In most earthquakes, the epicenter is the point where the greatest damage takes place, but the length of the subsurface fault rupture may indeed be a long one, and damage can be spread on the surface across the entire rupture zone. As an example, in the magnitude 7.9 2002 Denali earthquake in Alaska, the epicenter was at the western end of the rupture, but the greatest damage was about away at the eastern end. Focal depths of earthquakes occurring in continental crust mostly range from . Continental earthquakes below are rare whereas in subduction zones earthquakes can originate at depths deeper than .  Epicentral distance  During an earthquake, seismic waves propagate in all directions from the hypocenter. Seismic shadowing occurs on the opposite side of the Earth from the earthquake epicenter because the planet's liquid outer core refracts the longitudinal or compressional (P-waves) while it absorbs the transverse or shear waves (S-waves). Outside the seismic shadow zone, both types of wave can be detected but, because of their different velocities and paths through the Earth, they arrive at different times. By measuring the time difference on any seismograph and the distance on a travel-time graph on which the P-wave and S-wave have the same separation, geologists can calculate the distance to the quake's epicenter. This distance is called the epicentral distance, commonly measured in ¬∞ (degrees) and denoted as Œî (delta) in seismology. The L√°ska's empirical rule provides an approximation of epicentral distance in the range of 2 000 ‚àí 10 000 km. Once distances from the epicenter have been calculated from at least three seismographic measuring stations, the point can be located, using trilateration. Epicentral distance is also used in calculating seismic magnitudes as developed by Richter and Gutenberg.  Fault rupture  The point at which fault slipping begins is referred to as the focus of the earthquake. The fault rupture begins at the focus and then expands along the fault surface. The rupture stops where the stresses become insufficient to continue breaking the fault (because the rocks are stronger) or where the rupture enters ductile material. The magnitude of an earthquake is related to the total area of its fault rupture. Most earthquakes are small, with rupture dimensions less than the depth of the focus so the rupture doesn't break the surface, but in high magnitude, destructive earthquakes, surface breaks are common. Fault ruptures in large earthquakes can extend for more than . When a fault ruptures unilaterally (with the epicenter at or near the end of the fault break) the waves are stronger in one direction along the fault. Derivation and usage The word is derived from the New Latin noun epicentrum, the latinisation of the ancient Greek adjective ·ºêœÄŒØŒ∫ŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÇ (translgrcepikentros}}), \\"occupying a cardinal point, situated on a centre\\",·ºêœÄŒØŒ∫ŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus from ·ºêœÄŒØ (epi) \\"on, upon, at\\"·ºêœÄŒØ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus and Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ (kentron) \\"centre\\".epicentre, on Oxford Dictionaries The term was coined by the Irish seismologist Robert Mallet.

Garner also refers to a William Safire article in which Safire quotes a geophysicist as attributing the use of the term to \\"spurious erudition on the part of writers combined with scientific illiteracy on the part of copy editors\\". Nevertheless, Garner has noted that these usages may describe \\"focal points of unstable and potentially destructive environments.\\"  References  Seismology Geometric centers ","title":"Epicenter"},{"id":"173902","text":"Einar Benediktsson statue at the H√∂f√∞i house in Reykjavik, Iceland Einar Benediktsson, often referred to as Einar Ben, (31 October 1864 ‚Äì 12 January 1940) was an Icelandic poet and lawyer. Einar Benediktsson's poetry was a significant contribution to the nationalistic revival which led to Iceland's independence. To this end, he was active both in founding the Landvarnarflokkurinn in 1902, and as the editor of Iceland's first daily newspaper, Dagskr√°, from 1896 to 1898. As a poet, he may be classified as a Neo-Romantic. He advocated for Greenland to become part of an independent Iceland. He pioneered as a strong advocate of inward foreign investment to utilize Iceland's natural resources. In 1906 he joined the management of two companies, Skj√°lfanda and Gigant, formed to build and operate hydroelectric power plants, particularly the northern waterfalls of the Skj√°lfandaflj√≥t and J√∂kuls√° √° Fj√∂llum rivers. Fund raising began, but there was opposition from people who objected to foreign involvement. In 1914 Einar Benediktsson was one of the founders of Fossaf√©lagi√∞ T√≠tan and three sister companies Sirius, Orion and Taurus, established to harness the power of the √ûj√≥rs√° waterfalls. His translations include English, and American poetry, and a masterpiece in rendering Henrik Ibsen's epic, Peer Gynt, into Icelandic. Einar Benediktsson was buried at Iceland's national shrine, √ûingvellir. He has descendants living today in Iceland, other European countries, and the United States, most notably including former ambassador and namesake Einar Benediktsson (b. 1931).

He also serves as the director of the Joint Center for Translational Medicine, which joins Caltech and UCLA in a program to translate basic science discoveries into clinical realities. He is the president emeritus and Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology at Caltech. He also served as president of Rockefeller University from 1990 to 1991, and was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007. Baltimore has profoundly influenced international science, including key contributions to immunology, virology, cancer research, biotechnology, and recombinant DNA research, through his accomplishments as a researcher, administrator, educator, and public advocate for science and engineering. He has trained many doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, several of whom have gone on to notable and distinguished research careers. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he has received a number of awards, including the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1999. Baltimore sits on the Board of Sponsors for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and is a consultant to the Science Philanthropy Alliance. Early life and education Baltimore in the 1970s Baltimore was born on March 7, 1938, in New York City to Gertrude (Lipschitz) and Richard Baltimore. Raised in the Queens neighborhoods of Forest Hills and Rego Park, Queens, he moved with his family to suburban Great Neck, New York while he was in second grade because his mother felt that the city schools were inadequate. His father had been raised as an Orthodox Jew and his mother was an atheist, and Baltimore observed Jewish holidays and would attend synagogue with his father through his Bar Mitzvah.David Baltimore ‚Äì Interviewed by Sara Lippincott; October ‚Äì November 2009, California Institute of Technology. Accessed February 21, 2013. \\"But she was also committed to her family and to my father's right to have his religion, and we celebrated the major holidays, we fasted on Yom Kippur, and I walked with my father to the shul, which was a long walk from where we lived.\\" He graduated from Great Neck North High School in 1956, and credits his interest in biology to a high-school summer spent at the Jackson Laboratory's Summer Student Program in Bar Harbor, Maine.Nobel Prize autobiography.

Accessed October 23, 2007. \\"David Baltimore, 1975 Nobel laureate and one of the nation's best-known scientists, is a good case in point. The 60-year-old Baltimore, who graduated from Great Neck High School in 1956...\\" Baltimore earned his Bachelor's degree with high honors at Swarthmore College in 1960. He credits his interest in molecular biology to George Streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for one summer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Baltimore's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered MIT's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science. His early interest in phage genetics quickly yielded to a passion for animal viruses. He took the Cold Spring Harbor course on animal virology in 1961 and he moved to Richard Franklin's lab at the Rockefeller Institute at New York City which was one of the few labs pioneering molecular research on animal virology. There he made fundamental discoveries on virus replication and its effect on cell metabolism, including the first description of an RNA replicase. He completed his PhD thesis work in 1964. Career and research After his PhD, Baltimore returned to MIT for postdoctoral research with James Darnell in 1963. He continued his work on virus replication using poliovirus and pursued training in enzymology with Jerard Hurwitz at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1964/1965. =Independent investigator= In February 1965, Baltimore was recruited by Renato Dulbecco to the newly established Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla as an independent research associate. There he investigated poliovirus RNA replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists' early careers including Marc Girard, and Michael Jacobson. They discovered the mechanism of proteolytic cleavage of viral polyprotein precursors, pointing to the importance of proteolytic processing in the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins. He also met his future wife, Alice Huang, who began working with Baltimore at Salk in 1967. He and Alice together carried out key experiments on defective interfering particles and viral pseudo types. During this work, he made a key discovery that polio produced its viral proteins as a single large polyprotein that was subsequently processed into individual functional peptides. =Massachusetts Institute of Technology=  Reverse transcriptase  In 1968, he was recruited by soon-to-be Nobel laureate Salvador Luria to the department of biology at MIT as an associate professor of microbiology. Alice S. Huang also moved to MIT to continue her research on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). They became a couple, and married in October 1968. At MIT, Huang, Baltimore, and graduate student Martha Stampfer discovered that VSV involved an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase within the virus particle, and used a novel replication strategy to replicate its RNA genome. VSV entered a host cell as a single negative strand of RNA, but brought with it RNA polymerase to stimulate the processes of transcription and replication of more RNA. Baltimore extended this work and examined two RNA tumor viruses, Rauscher murine leukemia virus and Rous sarcoma virus. He went on to discover reverse transcriptase (RTase or RT) ‚Äì the enzyme that polymerizes DNA from an RNA template. In doing so, he discovered a distinct class of viruses, later name retroviruses, that use an RNA template to catalyze synthesis of viral DNA. This overturned the simplified version of the central dogma of molecular biology that stated that genetic information flows unidirectionally from DNA to RNA to proteins. Reverse transcriptase is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses, allowing such viruses to turn viral RNA strands into viral DNA strands. The viruses that fall into this category include HIV. The discovery of reverse transcriptase, made contemporaneously with Howard Temin, who had proposed the provirus hypothesis, showed that genetic information could traffic bidirectionally between DNA and RNA. They published these findings in back-to- back papers in the prestigious journal, Nature. This discovery was heralded as evidence that molecular and virological approaches to understanding cancer would yield new cures for the dreaded disease. This may have influenced President Richard Nixon's War on Cancer which was launched in 1971 and substantially increased research funding for the disease. In 1972, at the age of 34, Baltimore was awarded tenure as a professor of biology at MIT, a post that he held until 1997. Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA Baltimore also helped Paul Berg and Maxine Singer to organize the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, held in February 1975. The conference discussed possible dangers of new biotechnology, drew up voluntary safety guidelines, and issued a call for an ongoing moratorium on certain types of experiments and review of possible experiments. Baltimore was well aware of the importance of the changes occurring in the laboratory: \\"The whole Asilomar process opened up to the world that modern biology had new powers that you had never conceived of before.\\" =MIT Cancer Center= In 1973, he was awarded a prestigious American Cancer Society Professor of Microbiology that provided substantial salary support. Also in 1973, he became one of the early faculty members in the newly organized MIT Center for Cancer capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase. The MIT CRC was led by Salvador E. Luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including Baltimore, Phillips Robbins, Herman Eisen, Philip Sharp, and Robert Weinberg, who all went on to illustrious research careers. Baltimore was honored as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. He returned to New York City in 1975, for a year- long sabbatical at Rockefeller University working with Jim Darnell. In 1975, at the age of 37, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. The citation reads, \\"for their discoveries concerning the interaction between tumor viruses and the genetic material of the cell.\\" At the time, Baltimore's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase (Rtase or RT) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as HIV and was discovered independently, and at about the same time, by Mizutani and Temin. After winning the Nobel Prize, Baltimore reorganized his laboratory, refocusing on immunology and virology, with immunoglobulin gene expression as a major area of interest. He tackled new problems such as the pathogenesis of Abelson murine leukemia virus (AMuLV), lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology. In 1980, his group isolated the oncogene in AMuLV and showed it was a member of a new class of protein kinases that used the amino acid tyrosine as a phosphoacceptor. This type of enzymatic activity was also discovered by Tony Hunter, who has done extensive work in the area. He also continued to pursue fundamental questions in RNA viruses and in 1981, Baltimore and Vincent Racaniello, a post-doctoral fellow in his laboratory, used recombinant DNA technology to generate a plasmid encoding the genome of poliovirus, an animal RNA virus. The plasmid DNA was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced. The infectious clone, DNA encoding the genome of a virus, is a standard tool used today in virology. =Whitehead Institute of Biomedical Research= In 1982, with a charitable donation by businessman and philanthropist Edwin C. \\"Jack\\" Whitehead, Baltimore was asked to help establish a self-governed research institute dedicated to basic biomedical research. They devised a unique structure of an independent research institute composed of \\"members\\" with a close relationship with the department of biology of MIT. The Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (WIBR) was launched with $35 million to construct and equip a new building located across the street from the MIT cancer center in Cambridge Massachusetts. The institute also received $5 million per year in guaranteed income and a substantial endowment in his will (for a total gift of $135 million). Under Baltimore's leadership, a distinguished group of founding members including Gerald Fink, Rudolf Jaenisch, Harvey Lodish, and Robert Weinberg was assembled and eventually grew to 20 members in disciplines ranging from immunology, genetics, and oncology to fundamental developmental studies in mice and fruit flies. Whitehead Institute's contributions to bioscience have long been second to none. Less than a decade after its founding with continued leadership by Baltimore, the Whitehead Institute was named the top research institution in the world in molecular biology and genetics, and over a recent 10-year period, papers published by Whitehead scientists were the most cited papers of any biological research institute. After establishing the institute in a beautiful newly constructed research building across the street from the MIT cancer center, he served as director of the WIBR serving to expand the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics. The Whitehead Institute has been rated as doing \\"World leading research in genetics and molecular biology\\", and was an important partner in the Human Genome Project. During this time, Baltimore's own research program thrived in the new Institute. Important breakthroughs from Baltimore's lab include the discovery of the key transcription factor NF-Œ∫B by Dr. Ranjan Sen and David Baltimore in 1986. Their intention was to identify nuclear factors required for lg gene expression in B lymphocytes. What they discovered, NF-Œ∫B, turned out to have much broader importance. NF-Œ∫B is involved in regulating cellular responses and belongs to the category of \\"rapid-acting\\" primary transcription factors. Their discovery led to an \\"information explosion\\" involving \\"one of the most intensely studied signaling paradigms of the last two decades.\\" As early as 1984, Rudolf Grosschedl and David Weaver, postdoctoral fellows, in Baltimore's laboratory, were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease. They suggested that \\"control of lg gene rearrangement might be the only mechanism that determines the specificity of heavy chain gene expression within the lymphoid cell lineage.\\" in 1987, they created transgenic mice with the fused gene that developed fatal leukemia. David G. Schatz and Marjorie Oettinger, as students in Baltimore's research group in 1988 and 1989, identified the protein pair that rearranges immunoglobulin genes, the recombination-activating gene RAG-1 and RAG-2. this was a key discovery in determining how the immune system can have specificity for a given molecule out of many possibilities, and was considered by Baltimore as of 2005 to be \\"our most significant discovery in immunology\\". In 1990, as a student in David Baltimore's laboratory at MIT, George Q. Daley demonstrated that a fusion protein called bcr-abl is sufficient to stimulate cell growth and cause chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This work helped to identify a class of proteins that become hyperactive in specific types of cancer cells. It helped to lay the groundwork for a new type of drug, attacking cancer at the genetic level: Brian Druker's development of the anti- cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec), which deactivates bcr-abl proteins. Gleevec has shown impressive results in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia and also promise in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). =Rockefeller University= Baltimore served as the director of the Whitehead Institute until July 1, 1990, when he was appointed the sixth president of Rockefeller University in New York City. He moved his research group to New York and continued to make creative contributions to virology and cellular regulation. He also began important reforms in faculty management and promoted the status of junior faculty at the university. After resigning on December 3, 1991, Baltimore remained on the Rockefeller University faculty and continued research until spring of 1994. He then rejoined the MIT faculty as the Ivan R. Cottrell Professor of Molecular Biology and Immunology. =California Institute of Technology= JPL Director Charles Elachi, La Canada-Flintridge Mayor Greg Brown, Baltimore and JPL Deputy Director Eugene Tattini (2006).

During Baltimore's tenure at Caltech, United States President Bill Clinton awarded Baltimore the National Medal of Science in 1999 for his numerous contributions to the scientific world. In 2004, Rockefeller University gave Baltimore its highest honor, Doctor of Science (honoris causa). In 2003, as a postdoctoral fellow in David Baltimore's lab at Caltech, Matthew Porteus (now professor of Pediatrics at Stanford University and cofounder of CRISPR Therapeutics) was the first to demonstrate precise gene editing in human cells using chimeric nucleases. In October 2005, Baltimore resigned the office of the president at Caltech (see Luk van Parijs case). Former Georgia Tech Provost Jean-Lou Chameau succeeded Baltimore as president of Caltech. Baltimore remains the Millikan Professor of Biology at Caltech and is an active member of the institute's community. His laboratory at Caltech is focused on two major research areas: understanding the mammalian immune system and creating viral vectors to make the immune system more effective in resisting cancer. Understanding the diverse activity of the NF-Œ∫B transcription factor is one focus. NF-Œ∫B is now known to activate as many as 1000 genes in response to various stimuli. It is also known to play different roles in different cells. Another focus is understanding the functions of microRNA. MicroRNAs provide fine control over gene expression by regulating the amount of protein made by particular messenger RNAs. In recent research led by Jimmy Zhao, Baltimore's team has discovered a small RNA molecule called microRNA-146a (miR-146a) and bred a strain of mice that lacks miR146a. They have used the miR146a(-) mice as a model to study the effects of chronic inflammation on the activity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Their results suggest that microRNA-146a protects HSCs during chronic inflammation, and that its lack may contribute to blood cancers and bone marrow failure. =Public policy= Baltimore recently joined with other scientists to call for a worldwide moratorium on use of a new genome-editing technique to alter inheritable human DNA. A key step enabling researchers to slice up any DNA sequence they choose was developed by Emmanuelle Charpentier, then at Umea University in Sweden, and Jennifer A. Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley. Reminiscent of the Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA in 1975, those involved want both scientists and the public to be more aware of the ethical issues and risks involved with new techniques for genome modification. In addition to his influence on public policy for recombinant DNA research, Baltimore has influenced national policy concerning the AIDS epidemic. In 1986, he and Sheldon M. Wolff were invited by the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine to coauthor an independent report: Confronting AIDS (1986), in which they called for a $1 billion research program for HIV/AIDS. As of 1996 he was appointed head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Vaccine Research Committee (AVRC). Baltimore is a member of the National Academy of Sciences USA (NAS), 1974; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1974; the NAS Institute of Medicine (IOM), 1974; the American Association of Immunologists, 1984. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1987; the French Academy of Sciences, 2000; and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). He is also a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 1978. In 2006 Baltimore was elected to a three-year term as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Baltimore is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board and an Xconomist (an editorial advisor for the tech news and media company, Xconomy). Baltimore also serves on The Jackson Laboratory's board of trustees, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists' Board of Sponsors, Amgen, Inc.'s board of directors, and numerous other organizations and their boards. =Controversies= Imanishi-Kari case During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Thereza Imanishi-Kari, a scientist who was not in Baltimore's laboratory but in a separate, independent laboratory at MIT, was implicated in a case of scientific fraud. The case received extensive news coverage and a Congressional investigation. The case was linked to Baltimore's name because of his scientific collaboration with and later his strong defense of Imanishi-Kari against accusations of fraud. In 1986, while a professor of biology at MIT and director at Whitehead, Baltimore co-authored a scientific paper on immunology with Thereza Imanishi-Kari (an assistant professor of biology who had her own laboratory at MIT) as well as four others. A postdoctoral fellow in Imanishi-Kari's laboratory, Margot O'Toole, who was not an author, reported concerns about the paper, ultimately accusing Imanishi-Kari of fabricating data in a cover-up. Baltimore, however, refused to retract the paper. O'Toole soon dropped her challenge, but the NIH, which had funded the contested paper's research, began investigating, at the insistence of Walter W. Stewart, a self-appointed fraud buster, and Ned Feder, his lab head at the NIH. Representative John Dingell (D-MI) also aggressively pursued it, eventually calling in U.S. Secret Service (USSS; U.S. Treasury) document examiners.\\"Fraud in NIH Grant Programs,\\" April 12, 1988; \\"Scientific Fraud,\\" May 4 & 9, 1989; and \\"Scientific Fraud (Part 2),\\" May 14, 1990 (transcript includes April 30, 1990 hearing on R. Gallo's NIH lab) Around October 1989, when Baltimore was appointed president of Rockefeller University, around a third of the faculty opposed his appointment because of concerns about his behaviour in the Imanishi-Kari case. He visited every laboratory, one by one, to hear those concerns directly from each group of researchers. In a draft report dated March 14, 1991 and based mainly on USSS forensics findings, NIH's fraud unit, then called the Office of Scientific Integrity (OSI), accused Imanishi-Kari of falsifying and fabricating data. It also criticized Baltimore for failing to embrace O'Toole's challenge. Less than a week later, the report was leaked to the press.Hilts, Philip J. (March 21, 1991) \\"Crucial Data Were Fabricated In Report Signed by Top Biologist\\". New York Times, pp. A1, B10 Baltimore and three co-authors then retracted the paper; Imanishi-Kari and Moema H. Reis did not sign the retraction. In the report, Baltimore admitted that he was \\"too willing to accept\\" Imanishi-Kari's explanations, and felt he \\"did too little to seek an independent verification of her data and conclusions.\\" Baltimore publicly apologized for not taking a whistle-blower's charge seriously. Amid concerns raised by negative publicity in connection with the scandal, Baltimore resigned as president of Rockefeller University and rejoined the MIT Biology faculty.Angier, Natalie (May 19, 1992) \\"Embattled Biologist Will Return to M.I.T.\\" New York Times, p. C5. In July 1992, the US Attorney for the District of Maryland, who had been investigating the case, announced he would bring neither criminal nor civil charges against Imanishi-Kari.Gladwell, Malcolm (July 14, 1992) \\"Prosecutors Halt Scientific Fraud Probe; Researcher Baltimore Claims Vindication, Plans to 'Unretract' Paper\\". Washington Post, p. A3 In October 1994, however, OSI's successor, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI; HHS) found Imanishi-Kari guilty on 19 counts of research misconduct, basing its conclusions largely on Secret Service analysis of laboratory notebooks. An HHS appeals panel began meeting in June 1995 to review all charges in detail. In June 1996, the panel ruled that the ORI had failed to prove even one of its 19 charges. After throwing out much of the documentary evidence gathered by the ORI, the panel dismissed all charges against Imanishi-Kari. As their final report stated, the HHS panel \\"found that much of what ORI presented was irrelevant, had limited probative value, was internally inconsistent, lacked reliability or foundation, was not credible or not corroborated, or was based on unwarranted assumptions.\\" It did conclude that \\"The Cell paper as a whole is rife with errors of all sorts ... [including] some which, despite all these years and layers of review, have never previously been pointed out or corrected. Responsibility ... must be shared by all participants.\\" Neither OSI nor ORI ever accused Baltimore of research misconduct. The reputations of Stewart and Feder, who had pushed for the investigation, were very damaged. Baltimore has been both defended and criticized for his actions in this matter. In 1993, Yale University mathematician Serge Lang strongly criticized Baltimore's behavior. Historian of science Daniel Kevles, writing after the exoneration of Imanishi-Kari, recounted the affair in his 1998 book, The Baltimore Case. Horace Freeland Judson also gives a critical assessment of Baltimore's actions in The Great Betrayal: Fraud In Science. Baltimore has also written his own analysis.David Baltimore, 1989 (updated 2003) . Issues.org (July 9, 2003). Retrieved on 2012-02-17. Luk van Parijs case In October 2005, Baltimore resigned the office of the president of Caltech, saying, \\"This is not a decision that I have made easily, but I am convinced that the interests of the Institute will be best served by a presidential transition at this particular time in its history...\\" Soon after, at Baltimore's request, Caltech began investigating the work Luk van Parijs had conducted while a postdoc in Baltimore's laboratory.Beckett, Lois E. (October 31, 2005) \\"MIT Professor Fired for Faking Data; MIT biologist and HMS grad may also have falsified data in work at Harvard\\".Harvard Crimson. Van Parijs first came under suspicion at MIT, for work done after he had left Baltimore's lab. After van Parijs had been fired by MIT, his doctoral supervisor also noted problems with work van Parijs did at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, before leaving Harvard to go to Baltimore's lab. The Caltech investigation concluded in March 2007.

He is known for his studies on the heritability of IQ. Shortly after he died, his studies of inheritance of intelligence were discredited after evidence emerged indicating he had falsified research data, inventing correlations in separated twins which did not exist. Childhood and education Burt was born on 3 March 1883, the first child of Cyril Cecil Barrow Burt (b. 1857), a medical practitioner, and his wife Martha. He was born in London (some sources give his place of birth as Stratford-upon-Avon, probably because his entry in Who's Who gave his father's address as Snitterfield, Stratford; in fact the Burt family moved to Snitterfield when he was ten).Hearnshaw, (1979), p2. . The birth of Cyril Lodowic Burt was recorded in the General Register Office (now part of the Office for National Statistics) index of births in England and Wales for the June quarter of 1883:-BURT, Cyril Lodowic St. Geo. H. Sq. 1a 486 (The Registration district was St. Georges, Hanover Square, which included parts of Westminster) Burt's father initially kept a chemist shop to support his family while he studied medicine. On qualifying, he became the assistant house surgeon and obstetrical assistant at Westminster Hospital, London.Hearnshaw, (1979), p2 The younger Cyril Burt's education began in London at a Board school near St James's Park. In 1890, the family briefly moved to Jersey then to Snitterfield, Warwickshire in 1893, where Burt's father opened a rural practice. Early in Burt's life he showed a precocious nature, so much so that his father often took the young Burt with him on his medical rounds.Hearnshaw, (1979), p. 7. One of the elder Burt's more famous patients was Darwin Galton, brother of Francis Galton. The visits the Burts made to the Galton estate not only allowed the young Burt to learn about the work of Francis Galton, but also allowed Burt to meet him on multiple occasions and to be strongly drawn to his ideas; especially his studies in statistics and individual differences, two defining characters of the London School of Psychology whose membership includes both Galton and Burt. He attended King's (now known as Warwick) School, in the county town, from 1892 to 1895, and later won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital, then located in London, where he developed his interest in psychology. From 1902, he attended Jesus College, Oxford, where he studied Classics and took an interest in philosophy and psychology, the latter under William McDougall. McDougall, knowing Burt's interest in Galton's work, taught him the elements of psychometrics, thus helping Burt with his first steps in the development and structure of mental tests, an interest that would last the rest of his life. Burt was one of a group of students who worked with McDougall, which included William Brown, John Fl√ºgel, and May Smith, who all went on to have distinguished careers in psychology.Hearnshaw, (1979), p. 11. Burt graduated with second-class honours in Literae Humaniores (Classics) in 1906, taking a special paper in Psychology in his Final Examinations. He subsequently supplemented his BA with a teaching diploma. In 1907, McDougall invited Burt to help with a nationwide survey of physical and mental characteristics of the British people, proposed by Francis Galton, in which he was to work on the standardization of psychological tests. This work brought Burt into contact with eugenics, Charles Spearman, and Karl Pearson. In the summer of 1908, Burt visited the University of W√ºrzburg, Germany, where he first met the psychologist Oswald K√ºlpe.Hearnshaw, (1979), p13 Work in educational psychology Burt (at the time psychologist to the London County Council) measuring the speed of the thought of a child with a chronoscope In 1908, Burt took up the post of Lecturer in Psychology and Assistant Lecturer in Physiology at Liverpool University, where he was to work under the famed physiologist Sir Charles Sherrington. In 1909 Burt made use of Charles Spearman's model of general intelligence to analyse his data on the performance of schoolchildren in a battery of tests. This first research project was to define Burt's life's work in quantitative intelligence testing, eugenics, and the inheritance of intelligence. One of the conclusions in his 1909 paper was that upper-class children in private preparatory schools did better in the tests than those in the ordinary elementary schools, and that the difference was innate. In 1913, Burt took the part-time position of a school psychologist for the London County Council (LCC), with the responsibility of picking out the \\"feeble-minded\\" children, in accordance with the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913. He notably established that girls were equal to boys in general intelligence. The post also allowed him to work in Spearman's laboratory, and receive research assistants from the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, including Winifred Raphael. Burt was much involved in the initiation of child guidance in Great Britain and his 1925 publication The Young Delinquent led to opening of the London Child Guidance Clinic in Islington in 1927.Hearnshaw (1979) p. 44. In 1924 Burt was also appointed part-time professor of educational psychology at the London Day Training College (LDTC), and carried out much of his child guidance work on the premises. Later career In 1931 Burt resigned his position at the LCC and the LDTC after he was appointed Professor and Chair of Psychology at University College London, taking over the position from Charles Spearman, thus ending his almost 20-year career as a school psychological practitioner. One of his students, Reuben Conrad, recalled that he once arrived at the university with a chimpanzee that he had borrowed from London Zoo, though Conrad could not recall what point Burt was trying to make.D. Bishop, July 2016 The Psychologist Vol.29 (pp.578‚Äì579) https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-29/july/quality-and-longevity While at London, Burt influenced many students, including Raymond Cattell and Hans Eysenck, and toward the end of his life, Arthur Jensen and Chris Brand. Burt was a consultant with the committees that developed the 11-plus examinations. This issue, and the allegations of fraudulent scholarship against him, are discussed in various books and articles listed below, including Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed and The Mismeasure of Man. Despite his lasting reputation as a statistical psychologist Cyril Burt was also involved in psychoanalysis. He was a member of the Tavistock Clinic Council in the early 1930sHenry Dicks, 50 years of the Tavistock Clinic. Routledge 1970, p. 47. and of the British Psychoanalytical Society.Malcolm Pines, \\"The Development of the Psychodynamic Movement\\", in: 150 Years of British Psychiatry, 1841‚Äì1991. In The Young Delinquent,C. Burt, The Young Delinquent, London: University of London Press, 1925. he expressed the view that \\"nearly every tragedy of crime is in its origin a drama of domestic life.\\"Quoted by Adrian Wooldridge, Measuring the Mind: Education and Psychology in England, c. 1860 ‚Äì c. 1990. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 99. In 1942 Burt was elected President of the British Psychological Society. In 1946 he became the first British psychologist to be knighted for his contributions to psychological testing and for making educational opportunities more widely available, according to an account by J. Philippe Rushton. Burt was a member of the London School of Differential Psychology, and of the British Eugenics Society. Because he had suggested on radio in 1946 the formation of an organization for people with high IQ scores, he was made honorary president of Mensa in 1960. He officially joined Mensa soon thereafter. Burt retired in 1951 at the age of 68, but continued writing articles and books. He died of cancer at age 88 in London on 10 October 1971. \\"The Burt Affair\\" Over the course of his career, Burt published numerous articles and books on a host of topics ranging from psychometrics through philosophy of science to parapsychology. It is his research in behaviour genetics, most notably in studying the heritability of intelligence (as measured in IQ tests) using twin studies, that has created the most controversy, frequently referred to as \\"the Burt Affair.\\" Joynson, R. B. (1989). The Burt Affair. London: Routledge.Fletcher, R. (1991). Science, Ideology and the Media: The Cyril Burt Scandal. New Brunswick, US: Transaction Publishers.Mackintosh, N. J. (1995). Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed? Oxford Oxford University Press. Shortly after Burt died it became known that all of his notes and records had been burnt, and he was accused of falsifying research data. From the late 1970s, it has been generally accepted that \\"he had fabricated some of the data, though some of his earlier work remained unaffected by this revelation.\\" This was due in large part to research by Oliver Gillie (1976) and Leon Kamin (1974).Kamin, L. J. (1974). The Science and Politics of IQ. Potomac, Maryland: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.Gillie, O. (24 October 1976). Crucial data was faked by eminent psychologist. London: Sunday Times. The 2007 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica noted that it is widely acknowledged that his later work was flawed and many academics agree that data were falsified, though his earlier work is generally accepted as valid.\\"Sir Cyril Burt.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Britannica Concise Encyclop√¶dia. 19 April 2007. \\"Burt, Cyril Lodowic.\\" The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2005. The possibility of fabrication was first brought to the attention of the scientific community when Kamin noticed that Burt's correlation coefficients of monozygotic and dizygotic twins' IQ scores were the same to three decimal places, across articles ‚Äì even when new data were twice added to the sample of twins. Leslie Hearnshaw, a close friend of Burt and his official biographer, concluded after examining the criticisms that most of Burt's data from after World War II were unreliable or fraudulent.Hearnshaw, L.S. (1979). Cyril Burt: Psychologist. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. William H. Tucker argued in a 1997 article that: \\"A comparison of his twin sample with that from other well documented studies, however, leaves little doubt that he committed fraud.\\" Two other psychologists Arthur Jensen and J. Philippe Rushton, themselves involved in controversy for their views on race,See, for example: Francisco Gil-White, Resurrecting Racism, Chapter 10 * *Douglas Wahlsten (2001) Book Review of Race, Evolution and Behavior have claimed that the contentious correlations reported by Burt are in line with the correlations found in other twin studies.Miele, Frank (2002). Intelligence, Race, And Genetics: Conversations with Arthur R. Jensen, pp. 99‚Äì103. Oxford: Westview Press. Rushton (1997) wrote that five different studies on twins reared apart by independent researchers corroborated Cyril Burt's findings and had given almost the same heritability estimate (average estimate 0.75 vs. 0.77 by Burt). Jensen has also argued that \\"[n]o one with any statistical sophistication, and Burt had plenty, would report exactly the same correlation, 0.77, three times in succession if he were trying to fake the data.\\" Burt's statistical sophistication was, however, called into question by his student Charlotte Banks, who in a foreword to Burt's last book, published posthumously, wrote that he combined samples gathered from schoolchildren in different earlier years in his later papers without comment. A paper Burt published in 1943, Burt states an average IQ of 153.2 for the parents in the higher professional or administrative classes, at a time when there were no standardised IQ tests for adults in the upper ranges of IQ. In 1961, Burt revised this figure to 139.7 and, in other papers, noted that he had arrived at such figures by \\"assessment\\", or guesswork, rather than testing. According to Earl B. Hunt, it may never be found out whether Burt was intentionally fraudulent or merely careless. Noting that other studies on the heritability of IQ have produced results very similar to those of Burt's, Hunt argues that Burt did not harm science in the narrow sense of misleading scientists with false results, but that in the broader sense science in general and behaviour genetics in particular were profoundly harmed by the Burt Affair, leading to a general rejection of genetic studies of intelligence and a drying up of funding for such studies.Hunt, Earl (2011). Human Intelligence. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 234‚Äì35. Gillie's 1976 article in The Sunday Times, reprinted in The Phi Delta Kappan in 1977, summarised attempts to trace two of Burt's supposed collaborators, Margaret Howard and J. Conway. Publications attributed to these two were published in a journal edited by Burt between 1952 and 1959, including a joint paper of Burt and Howard,Burt, C., & Howard, M. (1956). The multifactorial theory of inheritance and its application to intelligence. British Journal of Statistical Psychology, 9, 95‚Äì131. remarkable as one of the few, if not the only, research paper not authored solely by Burt. The papers in the names of Howard or Conway were published after Burt's retirement from University College although their affiliations were said to be with University College, Howard's specifically with its Psychology Department. No-one with these names was registered as a member of staff or student at University College between 1914 and 1976, or in any other institution within the University of London, and its Psychology Department could not trace either of them. Between 1952 and 1959, Burt lived in London and had two associates, Charlotte Banks and Gertrude Keir, neither of who ever met Howard or Conway. Although they suggested to Gillie that Burt may have corresponded with the two, there was no trace of any such correspondence in Burt's papers. Burt's housekeeper from 1950 recalled to Gillie that she had questioned Burt on why he had written papers in the names of Howard and Conway; his response was that they had done the research and should be credited. He explained their absence and lack of contact by adding that both had emigrated and he had lost their addresses. Based on his investigation, Gillie considered it likely that neither Howard nor Conway existed, but were a fantasy of the ageing Burt himself. Arthur Jensen was given the opportunity to respond to Gillie's article in the same issue of the same journal, and described the claims as libellous, without evidence and driven by opposition to Burt's theories. However, he does not address the central issue, that Burt wrote scientific papers and published them as editor of a journal under false names and without the consent of the supposed authors. In response to articles by Fletcher, claiming that his biography of Burt and attacks by others were motivated by ideological or political malice, Hernshaw added to Gillie's claims by stating that Burt's detailed records of visitors contained no records of visits by Howard or Conway in the years they were supposed to have collaborated with him on collecting and testing 32 pairs of separated monozygotic twins, that his papers contained no correspondence with or written material from them, and that no one close to Burt had met them. He added that testing separated twins was expensive: Burt had no research funds to pay research workers and his own finances were too stretched to pay for it himself. Further, he instanced two other example of what he terms Burt's deviousness ignored by Fletcher. The first was Burt's falsification of the early history of factorial analysis and his untruthful claim to have been the first to use that technique. The second was that Burt could not have obtained the results on the declining levels of scholastic attainments in the 1950s and 1960s that he claimed to have. Finally, Hernshaw claimed that Burt's failings in his years of retirement went far beyond carelessness. In his 1991 book, Fletcher questioned Gillie's claim of the lack of independent articles published by Howard or Conway in scientific journals other than the Journal of Statistical Psychology edited by Burt, claiming Howard was also said to be mentioned in the membership list of the British Psychological Society, Prof. John Cohen was said to have remembered her well during the 1930s,Fletcher, Ronald (1991). Science, Ideology & the Media: The Cyril Burt Scandal. New Brunswick, N J: Transaction Publishers, p. 392. and Prof. Donald MacRae had personally received an article from her in 1949 and 1950. According to Ronald Fletcher, there is documentary evidence of the existence of Conway . Other writers have suggested that Howard and Conway may have existed, but that Burt had simply used their names to support his research, as he had been shown to have done with another named so- called researcher. Robert Joynson (in 1989) and Ronald Fletcher (in 1991) published books in support of Burt. However Joynson accepted that Burt frequently used assumed names to publish (in the journal Burt edited, the Journal of Statistical Psychology) papers that Burt had written himself: the names he used included those of Howard and Conway. Burt's defenders have claimed that everyone knew that, after his retirement, Burt's data was flawed and that he published articles under pseudonyms, adding that the British Psychological Society could have stopped this if it had violated accepted ethical norms of the time.L. J. Cronbach, (1979), Hearnshaw on Burt, Science, Vol. 206, p. 1392 However, although it is clear that some individual members of the British Psychological Society were aware of Burt's questionable conduct, the reason why he was not censured were as likely to be that it would have been in bad taste to call such a great man to public account, a fault of a profession and its members that could tolerate at the time, and apologise later, for Burt's behaviour.C. Karier, (1980). In Praise of Great Men: essay review of Cyril Burt, Psychologist. History of Education Quarterly, Vol. 20, No. 4, p. 481 Nicholas Mackintosh edited Cyril Burt: Fraud or Framed?, which was presented by the publisher as arguing that \\"his defenders have sometimes, but by no means always, been correct, and that his critics have often jumped to hasty conclusions. In their haste, however, these critics have missed crucial evidence that is not easily reconciled with Burt's total innocence, leaving the perception that both the defence and prosecution cases are seriously flawed.\\"Publisher's book description. https://www.amazon.com/Cyril- Burt-N-J-Mackintosh/dp/019852336X the first use of \\"critics\\" refers to Burt's attackers; the second use of \\"critics\\" refers to Burt's defenders, so is confusing W. D. Hamilton claimed in a 2000 book review shortly before Hamilton's death that the claims made by his detractors in the so-called \\"Burt Affair\\" had been either wrong or grossly exaggerated. However, Nicholas Mackintosh himself, then Emeritus Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Cambridge, expressed his own opinions in 1995. He summed up the evidence against Burt, saying that the data Burt presented were \\"so woefully inadequate and riddled with error\\", that consequently \\"no reliance (could) be placed on the numbers he present(ed)\\", and went on to confirm his agreement with Kamin's original conclusion, that Burt had fabricated his data.Mackintosh, 1995 Further reading =Biographies= Valentine, Charles (1965). \\"Cyril Burt: A Biographical Sketch and Appreciation.\\" In C.

In machine learning, one aims to construct algorithms that are able to learn to predict a certain target output. To achieve this, the learning algorithm is presented some training examples that demonstrate the intended relation of input and output values. Then the learner is supposed to approximate the correct output, even for examples that have not been shown during training. Without any additional assumptions, this problem cannot be solved since unseen situations might have an arbitrary output value. The kind of necessary assumptions about the nature of the target function are subsumed in the phrase inductive bias. A classical example of an inductive bias is Occam's razor, assuming that the simplest consistent hypothesis about the target function is actually the best. Here consistent means that the hypothesis of the learner yields correct outputs for all of the examples that have been given to the algorithm. Approaches to a more formal definition of inductive bias are based on mathematical logic. Here, the inductive bias is a logical formula that, together with the training data, logically entails the hypothesis generated by the learner. However, this strict formalism fails in many practical cases, where the inductive bias can only be given as a rough description (e.g. in the case of artificial neural networks), or not at all. Types The following is a list of common inductive biases in machine learning algorithms. * Maximum conditional independence: if the hypothesis can be cast in a Bayesian framework, try to maximize conditional independence. This is the bias used in the Naive Bayes classifier. * Minimum cross- validation error: when trying to choose among hypotheses, select the hypothesis with the lowest cross-validation error. Although cross-validation may seem to be free of bias, the \\"no free lunch\\" theorems show that cross- validation must be biased. * Maximum margin: when drawing a boundary between two classes, attempt to maximize the width of the boundary. This is the bias used in support vector machines. The assumption is that distinct classes tend to be separated by wide boundaries. * Minimum description length: when forming a hypothesis, attempt to minimize the length of the description of the hypothesis. The assumption is that simpler hypotheses are more likely to be true. See Occam's razor. * Minimum features: unless there is good evidence that a feature is useful, it should be deleted. This is the assumption behind feature selection algorithms. * Nearest neighbors: assume that most of the cases in a small neighborhood in feature space belong to the same class. Given a case for which the class is unknown, guess that it belongs to the same class as the majority in its immediate neighborhood. This is the bias used in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The assumption is that cases that are near each other tend to belong to the same class. Shift of bias Although most learning algorithms have a static bias, some algorithms are designed to shift their bias as they acquire more data. This does not avoid bias, since the bias shifting process itself must have a bias.

He wrote a book showing how the Poisson distribution, a discrete probability distribution, can be useful in applied statistics, and he made contributions to mathematical economics. He lived most of his professional life in Germany, where he taught at Strassburg University (Privatdozent, 1895‚Äì1897) and Berlin University (1901‚Äì1931). Life and work Bortkiewicz was born in Saint Petersburg, Imperial Russia, where he graduated from the Law Faculty in 1890. In 1898 he published a book about the Poisson distribution, titled The Law of Small Numbers.Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen [The law of small numbers] (Leipzig, Germany: B.G. Teubner, 1898). On page 1, Bortkiewicz presents the Poisson distribution. On pages 23‚Äì25, Bortkiewicz presents his famous analysis of \\"4. Beispiel: Die durch Schlag eines Pferdes im preussischen Heere Get√∂teten.\\" (4. Example: Those killed in the Prussian army by a horse's kick.). On pages 17‚Äì20 Bortkiewicz presents his analysis of \\"1. Beispiel: Die Selbstmorde von Kindern in Preussen.\\" (1. Example: Suicides of children in Prussia.). Bortkiewicz's book is reviewed in: L. v. Bortkewitsch (1898) \\"Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen,\\" Monatshefte f√ºr Mathematik, vol. 9, pages 39‚Äì41. In this book he first noted that events with low frequency in a large population follow a Poisson distribution even when the probabilities of the events varied. It was that book that made the Prussian horse-kicking data famous. The data gave the number of soldiers killed by being kicked by a horse each year in each of 14 cavalry corps over a 20-year period. Bortkiewicz showed that those numbers followed a Poisson distribution. The book also examined data on child-suicides. Somep.e. I J Good, Some statistical applications of Poisson's work, Statist. Sci. 1 (2) (1986), 157-180\\\\. JSTOR link have suggested that the Poisson distribution should have been named the \\"Bortkiewicz distribution.\\" Bortkiewicz' 1971 book The economic theory of Marx In political economy, Bortkiewicz is important for his analysis of Karl Marx's reproduction schema in the last two volumes of Capital. Bortkiewicz identified a transformation problem in Marx's work. Making use of Dmitriev's analysis of Ricardo, Bortkiewicz proved that the data used by Marx was sufficient to calculate the general profit rate and relative prices. Though Marx's transformation procedure was not correct‚Äîbecause it did not calculate prices and profit rate simultaneously, but sequentially‚ÄîBortkiewicz has shown that it is possible to get the correct results using the Marxian framework, i.e. using the marxian variables constant capital and variable capital it is possible to obtain the profit rate and the relative prices in a three-sector model. This \\"correction of the Marxian system\\" has been the great contribution of Bortkiewicz to classical and Marxian economics but it was completely unnoticed until Paul Sweezy's 1942 book \\"Theory of Capitalist Development\\". Piero Sraffa (1960) has provided the complete generalization of the simultaneous method for classical and Marxian analysis. Bortkiewicz died in Berlin, Germany. His papers, including a voluminous correspondence file (some 1,000 letters 1876‚Äì1931), were deposited at Uppsala University in Sweden,L.v.Bortkiewicz Archiv, Manuskript & Musik Abteilung, Universit√§tsbibliothek Uppsala, except for his correspondence with L√©on Walras which went into the collection of the Walras scholar William Jaff√© in the USA.

Definition Astronomer William Keel explains: > The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a > sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for > all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that > the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the > same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that > the universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists. The cosmological principle depends on a definition of \\"observer,\\" and contains an implicit qualification and two testable consequences. \\"Observers\\" means any observer at any location in the universe, not simply any human observer at any location on Earth: as Andrew Liddle puts it, \\"the cosmological principle [means that] the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are.\\" The qualification is that variation in physical structures can be overlooked, provided this does not imperil the uniformity of conclusions drawn from observation: the Sun is different from the Earth, our galaxy is different from a black hole, some galaxies advance toward rather than recede from us, and the universe has a \\"foamy\\" texture of galaxy clusters and voids, but none of these different structures appears to violate the basic laws of physics. The two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe (\\"the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample\\"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe (\\"the same physical laws apply throughout\\" ). The principles are distinct but closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous.  Origin  The cosmological principle is first clearly asserted in the Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687) of Isaac Newton. In contrast to earlier classical or medieval cosmologies, in which Earth rested at the center of universe, Newton conceptualized the Earth as a sphere in orbital motion around the Sun within an empty space that extended uniformly in all directions to immeasurably large distances. He then showed, through a series of mathematical proofs on detailed observational data of the motions of planets and comets, that their motions could be explained by a single principle of \\"universal gravitation\\" that applied as well to the orbits of the Galilean moons around Jupiter, the Moon around the Earth, the Earth around the Sun, and to falling bodies on Earth. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the Solar System, the identical nature of the Sun and distant stars and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of Earth itself.  Implications  Observations show that more distant galaxies are closer together and have lower content of chemical elements heavier than lithium.:Image:CMB Timeline75.jpg ‚Äì NASA (public domain image) Applying the cosmological principle, this suggests that heavier elements were not created in the Big Bang but were produced by nucleosynthesis in giant stars and expelled across a series of supernovae explosions and new star formation from the supernovae remnants, which means heavier elements would accumulate over time. Another observation is that the furthest galaxies (earlier time) are often more fragmentary, interacting and unusually shaped than local galaxies (recent time), suggesting evolution in galaxy structure as well. A related implication of the cosmological principle is that the largest discrete structures in the universe are in mechanical equilibrium. Homogeneity and isotropy of matter at the largest scales would suggest that the largest discrete structures are parts of a single indiscrete form, like the crumbs which make up the interior of a cake. At extreme cosmological distances, the property of mechanical equilibrium in surfaces lateral to the line of sight can be empirically tested; however, under the assumption of the cosmological principle, it cannot be detected parallel to the line of sight (see timeline of the universe). Cosmologists agree that in accordance with observations of distant galaxies, a universe must be non-static if it follows the cosmological principle. In 1923, Alexander Friedmann set out a variant of Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity that describe the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic universe.. Independently, Georges Lema√Ætre derived in 1927 the equations of an expanding universe from the General Relativity equations. translated by A. S. Eddington: Thus, a non-static universe is also implied, independent of observations of distant galaxies, as the result of applying the cosmological principle to general relativity.  Criticism  Karl Popper criticized the cosmological principle on the grounds that it makes \\"our lack of knowledge a principle of knowing something\\". He summarized his position as: :the ‚Äúcosmological principles‚Äù were, I fear, dogmas that should not have been proposed.Helge Kragh: ‚ÄúThe most philosophically of all the sciences‚Äù: Karl Popper and physical cosmology (2012)  Observations  Although the universe is inhomogeneous at smaller scales, it is statistically homogeneous on scales larger than 250 million light years. The cosmic microwave background is isotropic, that is to say that its intensity is about the same whichever direction we look at. However, recent findings have called this view into question. Data from the Planck Mission shows hemispheric bias in 2 respects: one with respect to average temperature (i.e. temperature fluctuations), the second with respect to larger variations in the degree of perturbations (i.e. densities). Therefore, the European Space Agency (the governing body of the Planck Mission) has concluded that these anisotropies are, in fact, statistically significant and can no longer be ignored. =Inconsistencies= The cosmological principle implies that at a sufficiently large scale, the universe is homogeneous. Based on N-body simulations in a ŒõCDM universe, Yadav and his colleagues showed that the spatial distribution of galaxies is statistically homogeneous if averaged over scales 260/h Mpc or more. A number of observations have been reported to be in conflict with predictions of maximal structure sizes: * The Clowes‚ÄìCampusano LQG, discovered in 1991, has a length of 580 Mpc, and is marginally larger than the consistent scale. * The Sloan Great Wall, discovered in 2003, has a length of 423 Mpc, which is only just consistent with the cosmological principle. * U1.11, a large quasar group discovered in 2011, has a length of 780 Mpc, and is two times larger than the upper limit of the homogeneity scale. * The Huge-LQG, discovered in 2012, is three times longer than, and twice as wide as is predicted possible according to these current models, and so challenges our understanding of the universe on large scales. * In November 2013, a new structure 10 billion light years away measuring 2000‚Äì3000 Mpc (more than seven times that of the SGW) has been discovered, the Hercules‚ÄìCorona Borealis Great Wall, putting further doubt on the validity of the cosmological principle. However, as pointed out by Seshadri Nadathur in 2013, the existence of structures larger than the homogeneous scale (260/h Mpc by Yadav's estimation) does not necessarily violate the cosmological principle (see Huge-LQG#Dispute). While the isotropy of the universe around Earth is confirmed at high significance by studies of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps, its homogeneity over cosmological scales is still a matter of debate. Perfect cosmological principle The perfect cosmological principle is an extension of the cosmological principle, and states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space and time. In this view the universe looks the same everywhere (on the large scale), the same as it always has and always will. The perfect cosmological principle underpins Steady State theory and emerges from chaotic inflation theory.

The term bhajanam (Sanskrit: ‡§≠‡§ú‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç) means reverence and originates from the root word bhaj (Sanskrit: ‡§≠‡§ú‡§§‡§ø), means to revere, as in \\"bhaja govindam\\". The term \\"bhajana\\" also means sharing. The term 'bhajan' is also commonly used to refer a group event, with one or more lead singers, accompanied with music, and sometimes dancing. Minimally there is a percussion accompaniment such as tabla, a dholak or tambourine. Handheld small cymbals (kartals) are commonly used to maintain the beat, rhythm. A bhajan may be sung in a temple, in a home, under a tree in the open, near a river bank or a place of historic significance.Anna King, John Brockington, The Intimate Other: Love Divine in Indic Religions, Orient Longman 2005, p 179. As a bhajan has no prescribed form, or set rules, it is in free form, normally lyrical and based on melodic ragas. It belongs to a genre of music and arts that developed with the Bhakti movement. It is found in the various traditions of Hinduism but particularly in Vaishnavism. It is also found in Jainism (different religion from Hinduism). Ideas from scriptures, legendary epics, the teachings of saints and loving devotion to a deity are the typical subjects of bhajans. South Indian bhakti pioneers, but bhajans have been widely composed anonymously and shared as a musical and arts tradition. Its genre such as Nirguni, Gorakhanathi, Vallabhapanthi, Ashtachhap, Madhura-bhakti and the traditional South Indian form Sampradya Bhajan each have their own repertoire and methods of singing. Etymology The Sanskrit word bhajan or bhajana is derived from the root , which means \\"divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to\\". The word also connotes \\"attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation\\". Hinduism =Historical roots= In Hinduism, Bhajan and its Bhakti analog Kirtan, have roots in the ancient metric and musical traditions of the Vedic era, particularly the Samaveda. The Samaveda Samhita is not meant to be read as a text, it is like a musical score sheet that must be heard.Frits Staal (2009), Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights, Penguin, , pages 107-112 Other late Vedic texts mention the two scholars Shilalin (IAST: ≈öilƒÅlin) and Krishashva (K·πõ≈õa≈õva), credited to be pioneers in the studies of ancient drama, singing and dance. The art schools of Shilalin and Krishashva may have been associated with the performance of Vedic rituals, which involved story telling with embedded ethical values. The Vedic traditions integrated rituals with performance arts, such as a dramatic play, where not only praises to gods were recited or sung, but the dialogues were part of a dramatic representation and discussion of spiritual themes.ML Varadpande (1990), History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1, Abhinav, , pages 45‚Äì47 The Vedas and Upanishads celebrate Nada-Brahman, where certain sounds are considered elemental, triggering emotional feelings without necessarily having a literal meaning, and this is deemed sacred, liminal experience of the primeval ultimate reality and supreme truth. This supreme truth is, states Guy Beck, considered as full of bliss and rasa (emotional taste) in the Hindu thought, and melodic sound considered a part of human spiritual experience. Devotional music genre such as Bhajan are part of a tradition that emerged from these roots. =Hindu Bhajans= A Bhajan in Hindu traditions is an informal, loosely structured devotional song with music in a regional language. They are found all over India and Nepal, but are particularly popular among the Vaishnavism sub-traditions such as those driven by devotion to avatars of Vishnu such as Krishna, Rama, Vitthal and Narayana (often with their consorts). In Southern India, Bhajanais follow a tradition (Sampradaya) called the Dakshina Bharatha Sampradaya Bhajanai. This involves a tradition that has been followed for the last several centuries and includes Songs/Krithis/Lyrics from great composers all over India encompassing many Indian languages. A Bhajan may be sung individually, or more commonly together as a choral event wherein the lyrics include religious or spiritual themes in the local language. The themes are loving devotion to a deity, legends from the Epics or the Puranas, compositions of Bhakti movement saints, or spiritual themes from Hindu scriptures. The Bhajans in many Hindu traditions are a form of congregational singing and bonding, that gives the individual an opportunity to share in the music-driven spiritual and liturgical experience as well as the community a shared sense of identity, wherein people share food, meet and reconnect. The bhajans have played a significant role in community organization in 19th and 20th century colonial era, when Indian workers were brought to distant lands such as Trinidad, Fiji and South Africa as cheap labor on plantations. Some Bhajan songs are centuries old, popular on a pan-regional basis, passed down as a community tradition, while others newly composed. Everyone in Hindu tradition is free to compose a Bhajan with whatever ideas or in praise of any deity of their wish, but since they are sung, they typically follow meters of classical Indian music, the raga and the tala to go with the musical instruments. They are sung in open air, inside temples such as those of Swaminarayan movement, in Vaishnava monasteries, during festivals or special events, and at pilgrimage centers. =Bhajan versus Kirtan in the Hindu traditions= A Bhajan is closely related to Kirtan, with both sharing common aims, subjects, musical themes and being devotional performance arts. A Bhajan is more free in form, and can be singular melody that is performed by a single singer with or without one and more musical instruments. Kirtan, in contrast, differs in being a more structured team performance, typically with a call and response musical structure, similar to an intimate conversation or gentle sharing of ideas, and it includes two or more musical instruments, with roots in the prosody principles of the Vedic era. Many Kirtan are structured for more audience participation, where the singer calls a spiritual chant, a hymn, a mantra or a theme, the audience then responds back by repeating the chant or by chanting back a reply of their shared beliefs.Sara Brown (2012), Every Word Is a Song, Every Step Is a Dance, PhD Thesis, Florida State University (Advisor: Michael Bakan), pages 25-26, 87-88, 277 A Bhajan, in contrast, is either experienced in silence or a \\"sing along\\". Jainism Stavan is a form of popular and historically pervasive genre of devotional music in Jainism. The subject of a Stavan varies, ranging from praise of Jina, Jain religious ideas and its philosophy, in a manner similar to Bhakti Bhajans. Jainism rejects any Creator god, but accepts protector deities and rebirth of souls as heavenly beings, and its devotional singing traditions integrate these beliefs. Stavan may include dancing and worship rituals. Known as Bhajan in north and west Indian regional languages, a Stavan is typically sung as folk melodies by groups of Jain women, and are formal part of ceremonies and celebrations within Jainism. Nowadays Many old and new Jain Stavans are being sung and recorded by Jain singers. Sikhism The Sikh tradition places major emphasis on devotional worship to one formless God, and Bhajans are a part of this worship. A more common form of community singing is called Shabad Kirtan in Sikhism. A Shabad Kirtan is performed by professional religious musicians, wherein bani (word, hymns) from the Sikh scripture are sung to a certain raga and tala. Modern composers and singers of Bhajans Local musicians singing bhajan at Kamakhya temple, Guwahati, Assam, India A modern Bhajan has no fixed form: it may be as simple as a mantra or kirtan or as sophisticated as the dhrupad, thumri or kriti with music based on classical ragas and talas.David Courtney: http://www.chandrakantha.com/articles/indian_music/bhajan.html V. D. Paluskar and V. N. Bhatkhande have combined Indian classical music with bhajan. Pandit Kumar Gandharva made famous the Nirguni Bhajans of Sant Kabir and Malwa Region. The dancer Mallika Sarabhai has produced performances based on bhajans. Abhinaya Chakravathi Sri JS Eswara Prasad Rao of Hyderabad, who is the disciple of AL Krishnamurthy Bhagavathar, Pudukkottai system, has produced performances based on Sampradaya bhajans under the title \\"Nitrya Sankeerthnam\\". Bhajans of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism traditions, Vedic mantras and Yoga chants have been composed, published in Western musical sheet format or recorded by western singers such as Krishna Das, Deva Premal, Miten, and by various West Indies singers influenced by East Indian heritage. The Stavan compositions and literature of the Jainism tradition are extensive, with a historic overview provided by Sri Sudhara Stavan Sangrah, traditionally preserved in \\"puja box\\" by Jain families.

He was well connected to the circles around John Knox, Bullinger, and Calvin, and firmly resisted the continuance of the English liturgy during the Marian exile. At last, he was ordained by the Presbyterians in Geneva. Upon his return to England, he became a well-known opponent to the rites of the Church of England. Through the patronage of the Earl of Leicester, he was collated to the Deanery of Durham, but in 1579 action was started to deprive him of all holy orders on account of his Presbyterian ordination. The process of deprivation was in process, when Whittingham died in 1579. The full record of Whittingham's appointment and trial may be found in Strype's Annals, II.ii., pp. 167, 168, 620. Early life Born at Chester about 1524, he was son of William Whittingham, by his wife, a daughter of Haughton of Hoghton Tower, Lancashire. In 1540, at the age of sixteen, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating B.A. and being elected fellow of All Souls' College in 1545. In 1547 he became senior student of Christ Church, Oxford earning the M.A. on 5 Feb 1547‚Äì8. On 17 May 1550, he was granted leave to travel for three years to study languages and civil law. He went to France, where he spent his time chiefly at the University of Orleans, but he also visited Lyon and studied at Paris, where his services as interpreter were used by the English ambassador, Sir John Mason or Sir William Pickering. Towards the end of 1552 Whittingham visited universities in Germany and Geneva. He briefly returned to England in May 1553. Whittingham had adopted radical Puritan views, but the accession of Queen Mary, the return of Anglo-Italian ecclesiastical policies of De Haeretico Comburendo in the form of Cardinal Pole's repatriation to England, and the vulnerabilities and liabilities associated with burnings-to-come (e.g. William Tyndale, 1536), anticipated persecutions, interfered with hopes of usefulness in ministerial labours. Late in August, however, he made intercession, which was ultimately successful, for the release of Peter Martyr; but after a few weeks he himself left England with difficulty by way of Dover to France. At Frankfort In the spring of 1554 Frankfort was the ecclesiastical centre for the English Marian exiles on the continent, and Whittingham was one of the first who reached the city on 27 June 1554; he sent out invitations to exiles in other cities to join them. Difficulties soon arose, however, between the party led by Whittingham and John Knox which sought to abolish all English liturgies and adopt the Genevan and Presbyterian mode of worship; and those who sought to retain the Anglican Prayerbooks, in particular Edward VI's second prayer-book. Whittingham was one of those appointed to draw up a service-book. He procured a letter from John Calvin, dated 18 January 1555, which prevailed; but the compromise adopted was disturbed by the arrival and public disruptions of Richard Cox, an uncompromising champion of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. In the party with Cox was John Jewel, the famed later bishop of Salisbury, who resolutely opposed Whittingham and Knox in their program. In the ensuing struggle between the two parties, Whittingham was Knox's chief supporter. However, he failed to prevent Knox's expulsion from Frankfort on 26 March; he gave his support to the form of church government established at Frankfort under Cox's influence. He was dissatisfied with the outcome, however. About 22 September 1555, he followed Knox to Geneva, a veritable beehive of growing scholarship and, in time, international influence. There he became ordained in the Presbyterian manner. There exists a nearly eye-witness narrative of the conflict, published in 1575, entitled 'A Brieff Discours off the Troubles begonne at Franckford in Germany, anno Domini 1554. Abowte the Booke off Common Prayer and Ceremonies, and continued by the Englishe men theyre to thende off Q. Maries Raigne,' 1575.'A Brieff Discours off the Troubles begonne at Franckford in Germany, anno Domini 1554. Abowte the Booke off Common Prayer and Ceremonies, and continued by the Englishe men theyre to thende off Q. Maries Raigne,' 1575. It bears no place or printer's name, but was printed probably at Geneva, and in the same type as Thomas Cartwright's tracts; one copy of the original edition is dated mdlxxiv. It was reprinted at London in 1642, in vol. ii. of 'The Phenix,' 1708; again in 1846 (ed. M'Crie), and in vol. iv. of 'Knox's Works' (Bannatyne Club). Recent scholars have argued that Whittingham is indeed the author of the narrative. At Geneva On 16 December 1555, and again in December 1556, Whittingham was elected a Presbyterian elder; on 16 December 1558, he was ordained as a deacon, and in 1559 he succeeded Knox as Presbyterian minister at Calvin's insistence. Upon Queen Mary's death, most of the exiles at Geneva returned to England, but Whittingham remained to complete the translation of the Geneva Bible. He had laboured with other scholars in the review of earlier English editions‚ÄîTyndale's, Coverdale's, the Thomas Matthew's Bible and other versions. He had already produced a version of the New Testament, which was issued at Geneva by Conrad Badius on 10 June 1557. He also took part in the minor revisions of the Old Testament. The critical and explanatory notes were largely textual and explanatory. It was printed at Geneva by Rowland Hall in 1560; after 1611, its popularity was not lost. More than 150 editions were printed up to 1644. It was an influential version for at least one hundred years. By the 17th century, as Laudian influences would gain ascendancy, all- things-Genevan grew to be condemned. Besides the translation of the Bible, Whittingham issued metrical versions some of Psalms. Seven of these were included among the fifty-one psalms published at Geneva in 1556; others were revised versions of Thomas Sternhold's psalms. A metrical rendering of the Ten Commandments by Whittingham was appended. Another edition of 1558, now lost, is believed to have contained nine fresh psalms of Whittingham; these were reprinted in the edition of 1561, to which Whittingham also contributed a version of the 'Song of Simeon' and two of the Lord's Prayer. Besides these, Whittingham translated four psalms in the Scottish psalter. These do not appear in any English edition. Whittingham revised for press Knox's work on predestination, published at Geneva in 1560. He contributed a dedicatory epistle to Christopher Goodman's 'How Superior Powers ought to be obeyed' (Geneva, 1558). As well, he was the Latin translator of the martyr Nicholas Ridley's 'Brief Declaration of the Lord's Supper' (Oxford, 1555); regarding his translation, a recent editor of the Declaration said this: > \\"... the Latin Version, to a reader who has learnt to love Ridley's noble > combination of courage and decision with fairness of thought and restraint > of expression, is a painful study. Its diffuseness is such as to make it > much more a parahprase than a version; and this diffuseness is largely > displayed in the rendering of Ridley's quiet English into an embittered > rhetoric, or in quite gratuitous and disputable additions. A few examples > may suffice...\\" Return to England Whittingham took formal leave of the council at Geneva on 30 May 1560. In January 1561, he was appointed to attend Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford during his embassy to the French court. In the following year he became a chaplain to Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, a minister at Le Havre, then occupied by the English under Warwick. He won general praise; but William Cecil complained of his neglect of conformity to the English Book of Common Prayer. Owing to the support of Warwick and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, another Puritan sympathizer, Whittingham was collated on 19 July 1563 to the deanery of Durham. In keeping with his past, Whittingham took his duties seriously, holding two services a day, devoting time to his grammar school and song school, and church music. Before the outbreak of the Rising of the North in 1569 he unsuccessfully urged James Pilkington, the bishop of Durham, to put the city in a state of defence, but he was more successful at Newcastle, which resisted the rebels. In 1572, when Lord Burghley became lord treasurer, Whittingham was suggested, probably by Leicester, as his successor in the office of secretary. In 1577, Leicester also promised Whittingham aid in securing the see of York or Durham, both being vacant; but Whittingham did not press for preferment. A Dean of Durham In 1564, Whittingham wrote a long letter to Leicester protesting against the 'old popish apparel' and the historic associations with Massing- vestments and theology. He refused to wear the surplice and cope, and proceedings by Church officials were begun against him in 1566. Whittingham eventually yielded, taking Calvin's moderating advice not to leave the ministry for external and minor matters of order. In 1577, however, he incurred the enmity of Edwin Sandys, the new archbishop of York, by resisting his claim to visit Durham Cathedral. According to William Hutchinson a commission had been issued in 1576 or 1577 to examine complaints against him. But this proved ineffectual because the Earl of Huntingdon and Matthew Hutton sided with the dean against the third commissioner, Sandys. A fresh commission was issued on 14 May 1578. This included the three former commissioners and about a dozen others. The articles against Whittingham are printed from the domestic state papers in the 'Camden Miscellany'; the charge that 'he is defamed of ' is entered as 'partly proved' and that of drunkenness as 'proved;' but the real allegation against Whittingham was the alleged inadequacy and invalidity of his ordination in Geneva. He admitted to not having been ordained according to the rites of the church of England. Archbishop Sandys further added that Whittingham had not even been validly ordained even according to Genevan standards, but had been elected preacher without the imposition of hands. Huntingdon repudiated the Archbishop and suggested a stay of the proceedings against Whittingham, arguing that 'it could not but be ill-taken of all the godly learned both at home and in all the reformed churches abroad, that we should allow of the popish massing priests in our ministry, and disallow of the ministers made in a reformed church'. However Archbishop Richard Bancroft, in 'Dangerous Positions', referred to him as 'afterward unworthily Dean of Durham', and ranks him with Goodman, Gilby, and other Puritans. So does Roger L'Estrange in his violent philippic, 'The Holy Cheat'. As the proceedings to deprive Whittingham of holy orders were proceeding, he was met with death, on 10 June 1579. He was buried in Durham Cathedral, where his tomb (ironically) was destroyed by the Presbyterian Scots in 1640. His will, dated 18 April 1579, is printed in 'Durham Wills and Inventories' (Surtees Soc. ii. 14‚Äì19). Family Whittingham's wife Catherine, daughter of Louis Jaqueman, was probably born not before 1535 and married to Whittingham on 15 November 1556. Her eldest son, Zachary, was baptised on 17 August 1557, and her eldest daughter, Susanna, on 11 December 1558; both died young. Whittingham was survived by two sons, Sir Timothy and Daniel, and four daughters.

Britannica Online Encyclopedia. In Jewish apocrypha and early kabbalah, \\"Metatron\\" is the name that Enoch received after his transformation into an angel.  Origins  From Hellenistic times, mention of a second divine figure, either beside YHWH or beneath him, occur in a number of Jewish texts, mostly apocryphal. These Jewish traditions implying a divine dualism were most frequently associated with Enoch. In the rabbinic period they centre on 'Metatron', often in the context of debates over the heretical doctrine of 'two powers in heaven' (shtei rashunot ba- shammayim).Alan Segal, Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and Gnosticism, BRILL 2002 pp.60ff. Ultimately these ideas appear to go back to differing interpretations of the heavenly enthronement passages at Exodus 24:10f., Daniel 7:9f. and perhaps even Ezekiel 1:26f.Segal ibid. p.60 interpretations that came to distinguish what was orthodox from what was heretical in Judaism. Among the pseudepigrapha 1 Enoch: Book of Parables presents two figures: the son of man and Enoch. At first, these two characters seem to be separate entities. Enoch views the son of man enthroned in Heaven. Later, however, they prove to be one and the same. Many scholars believe that the final chapters in the Book of Parables are a later addition. Others think they are not and that the son of man is Enoch's heavenly double similarly to the Prayer of Joseph where Jacob is depicted as an angel. The Book of Daniel displays two similar characters: the Ancient of Days and the one like a man. Parts of the text in Daniel are Aramaic and may have been changed in translation. The Septuagint reads that the son of man came as the Ancient of Days. All other translations say the son of man gained access to the Ancient of Days and was brought before that one. The identification of Metatron with the gnostic 3 Enoch, where the name first appears, is not explicitly made in the Talmud although it does refer to a Prince of the World who was young but now is old. However, some of the earliest kabbalists assumed the connection. There also seems to be two Metatrons, one spelled with six letters (◊û◊ò◊ò◊®◊ï◊ü), and one spelled with seven (◊û◊ô◊ò◊ò◊®◊ï◊ü). The former may be the transformed Enoch, Prince of the Countenance within the divine palace; the latter, the Primordial Metatron, an emanation of the \\"Cause of Causes\\", specifically the tenth and last emanation, identified with the earthly Divine Presence. Furthermore, the Merkabah text Re' uyot Yehezkel identifies the Ancient of Days from the Book of Daniel as Metatron. =Scholem's scholastic analysis= Many scholars see a discontinuity between how Enoch is portrayed in the early Enoch literature and how Metatron is portrayed. Scholars commonly see the character of Metatron as being based on an amalgam of Jewish literature, in addition to Enoch, Michael, Melchizedek, and Yahoel among others are seen as influences. Gershom Scholem argues Metatron's character was influenced by two streams of thought. One of which linked Metatron with Enoch, while the second was a fusing of different obscure entities and mythic motifs. Scholem argues that this second tradition was originally separate but later became fused with the Enoch tradition. He points to texts where this second Metatron is a primordial angel and referred to as Metatron Rabbah. Scholem theorizes that the two Hebrew spellings of Metatron's name are representative of these two separate traditions. In his view the second Metatron is linked to Yahoel. Scholem also links Yahoel with Michael. In the Apocalypse of Abraham Yahoel is assigned duties normally reserved for Michael. Yahoel's name is commonly seen as a substitute for the Ineffable Name. In 2 Enoch, Enoch is assigned titles commonly used by Metatron such as \\"the Youth, the Prince of the Presence and the Prince of the World.\\" However we do not see Enoch referred to as the Lesser YHWH. In 3 Enoch, Metatron is called the lesser YHWH. This raises a problem since the name Metatron does not seem to be directly related to the name of God YHWH. Scholem proposes this is because the lesser YHWH is a reference to Yahoel. In Maaseh Merkabah the text reasons that Metatron is called the lesser YHWH because in Hebrew gematria Metatron is numerically equivalent to another name of God Shaddai. Scholem does not find this convincing. Scholem point to the fact that both Yahoel and Metatron were known as the lesser YHWH. In 3 Enoch 48D1 Metatron is called both Yahoel Yah and Yahoel. In addition to being one of the seventy names of Metatron from 3 Enoch 48D. Yahoel and Metatron are also linked in Aramaic incantation bowl inscriptions.  Talmud  The Babylonian Talmud mentions Metatron by name in three places: Hagigah 15a, Sanhedrin 38b and Avodah Zarah 3b. Hagigah 15a describes Elisha ben Abuyah in Paradise seeing Metatron sitting down (an action that is not done in the presence of God). Elishah ben Abuyah therefore looks to Metatron as a deity and says heretically: \\"There are indeed two powers in Heaven!\\"Hagigah 15a The rabbis explain that Metatron had permission to sit because of his function as the Heavenly Scribe, writing down the deeds of Israel. The Talmud states, it was proved to Elisha that Metatron could not be a second deity by the fact that Metatron received 60 \\"strokes with fiery rods\\" to demonstrate that Metatron was not a god, but an angel, and could be punished. In Sanhedrin 38b one of the minim tells Rabbi Idith that Metatron should be worshiped because he has a name like his master. Rabbi Idith uses the same passage Exodus 23:21 to show that Metatron was an angel and not a deity and thus should not be worshiped. Furthermore, as an angel Metatron has no power to pardon transgressions nor was he to be received even as a messenger of forgiveness.Sanhedrin 38a In Avodah Zarah 3b, the Talmud hypothesizes as to how God spends His day. It is suggested that in the fourth quarter of the day God sits and instructs the school children, while in the preceding three quarters Metatron may take God's place or God may do this among other tasks.Avodah Zarah 3b Yevamot 16b records an utterance, \\"I have been young; also I have been old\\" found in Psalm 37:25. The Talmud here attributes this utterance to the Chief Angel and Prince of the World, whom the rabbinic tradition identifies as Metatron.  Kirkisani  The tenth century Karaite scholar Jacob Qirqisani believed that rabbinic Judaism was the heresy of Jeroboam of the Kingdom of Israel. He quoted a version of Sanhedrin 38b, which he claimed contained a reference to the \\"lesser YHVH.\\" Gershom Scholem suggests that the name was deliberately omitted from later copies of the Talmud. However, Qirqisani may have misrepresented the Talmud in order to embarrass his Rabbanite opponents with evidence of polytheism. Extra- talmudic mystical texts such as Sefer Hekhalot do speak of a \\"lesser YHWH\\", apparently deriving the concept from Exodus 23:21, which mentions an angel of whom God says \\"my name [understood as YHVH, the usual divine Proper Name] is in him\\".  Merkabah, Zohar and other mystical writings  Metatron also appears in the Pseudepigrapha including Shi'ur Qomah, and most prominently in the Hebrew Merkabah Book of Enoch, also called 3 Enoch or Sefer Hekhalot (Book of [the Heavenly] Palaces). The book describes the link between Enoch, son of Jared (great grandfather of Noah) and his transformation into the angel Metatron. His grand title \\"the lesser YHVH\\" resurfaces here. The word Metatron is numerically equivalent to Shaddai (God) in Hebrew gematria; therefore, he is said to have a \\"Name like his Master\\". Metatron says, \\"He [the Holy One]... called me, 'The lesser YHVH' in the presence of his whole household in the height, as it is written, 'my name is in him.'\\" (12:5, Alexander's translation.) The narrator of this book, supposedly Rabbi Ishmael, tells how Metatron guided him through Heaven and explained its wonders. 3 Enoch presents Metatron in two ways: as a primordial angel (9:2‚Äì13:2) and as the transformation of Enoch after he was assumed into Heaven.\\"Enoch as Metatron and conversion of Moses from flesh to fire\\" , Journal of the Royal Asiastic Society, 1893.. Metatron \\"the Youth\\", a title previously used in 3 Enoch, where it appears to mean \\"servant\\". It identifies him as the angel that led the people of Israel through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt (again referring to Exodus 23:21, see above), and describes him as a heavenly priest. In the later Ecstatic Kabbalah, Metatron is a messianic figure. The Zohar describes Metatron as the \\"King of the angels.\\" and associates the concept of Metatron with that of the divine name Shadday. Zohar commentaries such as the \\"Ohr Yakar\\" by Moses ben Jacob Cordovero explain the Zohar as meaning that Metaron as the head of Yetzira This corresponds closely with Maimonides' description of the Talmudic \\"Prince of the World\\", traditionally associated with Metatron, as the core \\"Active Intellect.\\" The Zohar describes several biblical figures as metaphors for Metatron. Examples are Enoch, Joseph, Eliezer, Joshua, and others. The Zohar finds the word \\"youth\\" used to describe Joseph and Joshua a hint that the figures are a metaphor to Metatron, and also the concept of \\"servant\\" by Eliezer as a reference to Metatron. The Staff of Moses is also described by the Zohar as a reference to Metatron. The Zohar also states that the two tets in \\"totaphot\\" of the phylacteries are a reference to Metatron. The Zohar draws distinction between Metatron and Michael. While Michael is described repeatedly in the Zohar as the figure represented by the High Priest, Metatron is represented by the structure of the tabernacle itself.  Apocalyptic texts  In the Apocalypse of Zerubbabel Metatron is not identified as Enoch. Instead he is identified as the archangel Michael. The text also records that Metatron in gematria is the equivalent of Shadday. While he also appears in other apocalyptic writings he is most prominent in the Apocalypse of Zerubbabel. In these writings he plays the role of heavenly interlocutor delivering knowledge about the coming messianic age.  Islam  The earliest account of Metatron within Islamic scriptures might derive directly from the Quran itself. Uzair, according to Surah 9:30-31 venerated as a Son of God by Jews, is another name for the prophet Ezra, who was also identified with Metatron in Merkabah Mysticism.Steven M. Wasserstrom Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam Princeton University Press 2014 p. 184 Islamic heresiologists repeatedly accused Jews for venerating an angel as a lesser god (or an Incarnation of God), especially for celebrating Rosh Hashanah.Hava Lazarus-Yafeh Intertwined Worlds: Medieval Islam and Bible Criticism Princeton University Press 2004 p. 32 The name itself is attested early in Islam by Al-Kindi and Al-Masudi.Steven M. Wasserstrom Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam Princeton University Press 2014 p. 192 In a Druze text about cosmology, he is mentioned among the canonical Archangels in Islamic traditions.Steven M.

Wasserstrom Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam Princeton University Press 2014 p. 193 He is also frequently mentioned in the magical works by Ahmad al-Buni, who describes Metatron as wearing a crown and a lance, probably constituting the Staff of Moses.Steven M. Wasserstrom Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam Princeton University Press 2014 p. 198 In other magical practises, he is invoked to ward off evil jinn, demons, sorcerers and other magical threats.Steven M. Wasserstrom Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam Princeton University Press 2014 p. 199  Etymology  There are numerous possible etymologies for the name Metatron.Andrei A. Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition (TSAJ, 107; Tuebingen: Mohr-Siebeck, 2005) 92-97 However, some scholars, such as Philip Alexander, believe if the name Metatron originated in Hekhalot-Merkabah texts (such as 3 Enoch), then it may be a magic word like Adiriron and Dapdapiron.Alexander, P. \\"3 Enoch\\", 1.243; idem, \\"The Historical Settings of the Hebrew Book of Enoch\\", 162. Hugo Odeberg, Adolf JellinekJellinek. A. \\"Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Kabbala\\" (Leipzig c.l. Fritzsche 1852) Page 4 and Marcus JastrowJastrow. M. \\"A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature.\\" Page 767 suggest the name may originate from either Mattara (◊û◊ò◊®◊ê) \\"keeper of the watch\\" or the verb Memater (◊û◊û◊ò◊®) \\"to guard, to protect\\". An early derivation of this can be seen in Shimmusha Rabbah, where Enoch is clothed in light and is the guardian of the souls ascending to heaven. Odeberg also suggests that the name Metatron might be taken from the Old Persian name Mithra. Citing Wiesner,in Ben Chananja, 1862, p. 384; 1866, pp. 600-625 he lays out a number of parallels between Mithra and Metatron based on their positions in heaven and duties. Metatron seems to be made up of two Greek words for after and throne, (meta thronos), taken together as \\"one who serves behind the throne\\" or \\"one who occupies the throne next to the throne of glory\\". The two words do not appear separately in any text known to Gershom Scholem, who therefore dismisses the ideaScholem, Major Trends, 69. with the words \\"this widely repeated etymology...has no merit.\\"Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 91, and 43. The word (synthronos) is used as \\"co-occupant of the divine throne\\";sunthronos, the Greek term metaturannos, which can be translated as \\"the one next to the ruler\\". Philip Alexander, \\"3 Enoch\\" however, like the above etymology, it is not found in any source materials. It is supported by Saul Lieberman and Peter Sch√§fer, who give further reasons why this might be a viable etymology.Lieberman, Saul. \\"Metatron, the Meaning of His Name and His Functions in: I. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism\\" Leiden, Brill, 1980. 235‚Äì241. The Latin word Metator (messenger, guide, leader, measurer) had been suggested by Eleazar of Worms (c. 1165 ‚Äì c. 1230), Nachmanides, and brought to light again by Hugo Odeberg. When transliterated into the Hebrew language, we get ◊û◊ò◊ô◊ò◊ï◊® or ◊û◊ô◊ò◊ò◊ï◊®. Gershom Scholem argues that there is no data to justify the conversion of metator to metatron. Philip Alexander also suggests this as a possible origin of Metatron, stating that the word Metator also occurs in Greek as mitator‚Äìa word for an officer in the Roman army who acted as a forerunner. Using this etymology, Alexander suggests the name may have come about as a description of \\"the angel of the Lord who led the Israelites through the wilderness: acting like a Roman army metator guiding the Israelites on their way\\".Alexander, P. \\"From Son of Adam to a Second God\\" and Alexander, P. \\"3 Enoch\\"Urbach, Ephra√Øm Elimelech. \\"The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs\\" Cambridge, Maa. : Harvard University Press, 1987, ¬©1979. OCLC: 15489564 Another possible interpretation is that of Enoch as a metator showing them \\"how they could escape from the wilderness of this world into the promised land of heaven\\". Because we see this as a word in Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, and Greek, Alexander believes this gives even more strength to this etymology. Other ideas include (metron, \\"a measure\\").Black, Matthew. \\"The Origin of the Name of Metatron\\". Can be linked back to the title praemetitor in Philos QG which can be connected to the Greek word for Metator \\"measurer\\". Charles Mopsik believes that the name Metatron may be related to the sentence from Genesis 5:24 \\"Enoch walked with God, then he was no more, because God took him.\\"Mopsik, C. Le Livre h√©breu d‚ÄôH√©noch ou Livre des palais. Paris: Verdier, 1989. The Greek version of the Hebrew word \\"to take\\" is (he was transferred). (RON) is a standard addition to (Metatron) and other angelic names in the Jewish faith. According to Mopsik, (MTT) is a transliteration from the Greek . In the entry entitled \\"Paradigmata\\" in his study, \\"'The Written' as the Vocation of Conceiving Jewishly\\", John W McGinley gives an accounting of how this name functions in the Bavli's version of \\"four entered pardes\\".McGinley, John W; \\"The Written\\" as the Vocation of Conceiving Jewishly. . The entry \\"Paradigmatia\\" gives an accounting of the meaning of \\"Metatron\\" as it is used in the Bavli's version of \\"four entered pardes\\". This account maintains that \\"Ishmael ben Elisha\\" is a rabbinically sanctioned cognomen for Elisha ben Abbuyah (the \\"Akher\\" of the Bavli's account). This hypothesis explains why the generators of the \\"chambers\\" portion of the Heikhalot literature make \\"Ishmael ben Elisha\\" the major protagonist of their writings even though this Rabbi Ishmael was not directly mentioned in the Bavli's account (in the Gemara to tractate Khaggigah) of \\"The Work of the Chariot\\". Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport in Igrot Shir suggests that Metatron is a combination of two Greek words which mean to \\"change\\" and \\"pass away\\" referring to Chanoch (Enoch) who \\"changed\\" into an angel and \\"passed away\\" from the world.

Tomson was a Calvinist, and his annotations reflect that system of theology. Life He was born in Northamptonshire, and was admitted a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1553. He graduated B.A. in 1559, was elected a fellow of his college, and commenced M.A. in 1564. He accompanied Sir Thomas Hoby on his embassy to France in 1566; and in 1569 he resigned his fellowship. Between 1575 and 1587 Tomson represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the House of Commons, and he was member for Downton in 1588‚Äì9. In 1582 he was in attendance at court at Windsor Castle. According to his epitaph he travelled in Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and France; was conversant with twelve languages; and at one period gave public lectures on the Hebrew language at Geneva. He was employed in political affairs by Sir Francis Walsingham, after whose death he retired into private life. Tomson died on 29 March 1608, and was buried in the chancel of the church at Chertsey, Surrey, where a black marble was erected to his memory with a curious Latin inscription.

This is the point to which a force may be applied to cause a linear acceleration without an angular acceleration. Calculations in mechanics are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass. It is a hypothetical point where the entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion. In other words, the center of mass is the particle equivalent of a given object for application of Newton's laws of motion. In the case of a single rigid body, the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the centroid. The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is sometimes the case for hollow or open-shaped objects, such as a horseshoe. In the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the planets of the Solar System, the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system. The center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in mechanics that involve masses distributed in space, such as the linear and angular momentum of planetary bodies and rigid body dynamics. In orbital mechanics, the equations of motion of planets are formulated as point masses located at the centers of mass. The center of mass frame is an inertial frame in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system. History The concept of \\"center of mass\\" in the form of the center of gravity was first introduced by the great ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer Archimedes of Syracuse. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the torque exerted on a lever by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point‚Äîtheir center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes. Later mathematicians who developed the theory of the center of mass include Pappus of Alexandria, Guido Ubaldi, Francesco Maurolico, Federico Commandino, Simon Stevin, Luca Valerio, Jean- Charles de la Faille, Paul Guldin, John Wallis, Louis Carr√©, Pierre Varignon, and Alexis Clairaut. Newton's second law is reformulated with respect to the center of mass in Euler's first law. Diagram of an educational toy that balances on a point: the center of mass (C) settles below its support (P) Definition The center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. In analogy to statistics, the center of mass is the mean location of a distribution of mass in space. =A system of particles= In the case of a system of particles , each with mass that are located in space with coordinates , the coordinates R of the center of mass satisfy the condition : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}) = 0. Solving this equation for R yields the formula :\\\\mathbf{R} = \\\\frac 1M \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\mathbf{r}_i, where is the sum of the masses of all of the particles. =A continuous volume= If the mass distribution is continuous with the density œÅ(r) within a solid Q, then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this volume relative to the center of mass R over the volume V is zero, that is :\\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q} \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r})(\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R})dV = 0. Solve this equation for the coordinates R to obtain :\\\\mathbf R = \\\\frac 1M \\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\mathbf{r} dV, where M is the total mass in the volume. If a continuous mass distribution has uniform density, which means œÅ is constant, then the center of mass is the same as the centroid of the volume. =Barycentric coordinates= The coordinates R of the center of mass of a two-particle system, P1 and P2, with masses m1 and m2 is given by : \\\\mathbf{R} = \\\\frac{1}{m_1+m_2}(m_1 \\\\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2\\\\mathbf{r}_2). Let the percentage of the total mass divided between these two particles vary from 100% P1 and 0% P2 through 50% P1 and 50% P2 to 0% P1 and 100% P2, then the center of mass R moves along the line from P1 to P2. The percentages of mass at each point can be viewed as projective coordinates of the point R on this line, and are termed barycentric coordinates. Another way of interpreting the process here is the mechanical balancing of moments about an arbitrary point. The numerator gives the total moment that is then balanced by an equivalent total force at the center of mass. This can be generalized to three points and four points to define projective coordinates in the plane, and in space, respectively. =Systems with periodic boundary conditions= For particles in a system with periodic boundary conditions two particles can be neighbours even though they are on opposite sides of the system. This occurs often in molecular dynamics simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems is to treat each coordinate, x and y and/or z, as if it were on a circle instead of a line. The calculation takes every particle's x coordinate and maps it to an angle, :\\\\theta_i = \\\\frac{x_i}{x_{max}} 2 \\\\pi where xmax is the system size in the x direction and x_i\\\\in[0,x_{max}). From this angle, two new points (\\\\xi_i,\\\\zeta_i) can be generated, which can be weighted by the mass of the particle x_{i} for the center of mass or given a value of 1 for the geometric center: : \\\\xi_i = \\\\cos(\\\\theta_i) : \\\\zeta_i = \\\\sin(\\\\theta_i) In the (\\\\xi,\\\\zeta) plane, these coordinates lie on a circle of radius 1. From the collection of \\\\xi_i and \\\\zeta_i values from all the particles, the averages \\\\overline{\\\\xi} and \\\\overline{\\\\zeta} are calculated. :\\\\overline{\\\\xi} = \\\\frac 1M \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\xi_i, :\\\\overline{\\\\zeta} = \\\\frac 1M \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\zeta_i, where is the sum of the masses of all of the particles. These values are mapped back into a new angle, \\\\overline{\\\\theta}, from which the x coordinate of the center of mass can be obtained: : \\\\overline{\\\\theta} = \\\\mathrm{atan2}(-\\\\overline{\\\\zeta},-\\\\overline{\\\\xi}) + \\\\pi : x_{com} = x_{max} \\\\frac{ \\\\overline{\\\\theta}}{2 \\\\pi} The process can be repeated for all dimensions of the system to determine the complete center of mass. The utility of the algorithm is that it allows the mathematics to determine where the \\"best\\" center of mass is, instead of guessing or using cluster analysis to \\"unfold\\" a cluster straddling the periodic boundaries. If both average values are zero, (\\\\overline{\\\\xi},\\\\overline{\\\\zeta}) = (0,0), then \\\\overline{\\\\theta} is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their x coordinates are mathematically identical in a periodic system. Center of gravity A body's center of gravity is the point around which the resultant torque due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same. However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field between closer-to (stronger) and further-from (weaker) the planet can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical. In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center. Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an applied torque. It is useful to note that the mass-center is a fixed property for a given rigid body (e.g. with no slosh or articulation), whereas the center-of-gravity may, in addition, depend upon its orientation in a non-uniform gravitational field. In the latter case, the center-of-gravity will always be located somewhat closer to the main attractive body as compared to the mass-center, and thus will change its position in the body of interest as its orientation is changed. In the study of the dynamics of aircraft, vehicles and vessels, forces and moments need to be resolved relative to the mass center. That is true independent of whether gravity itself is a consideration. Referring to the mass-center as the center- of-gravity is something of a colloquialism, but it is in common usage and when gravity gradient effects are negligible, center-of-gravity and mass-center are the same and are used interchangeably. In physics the benefits of using the center of mass to model a mass distribution can be seen by considering the resultant of the gravity forces on a continuous body. Consider a body Q of volume V with density œÅ(r) at each point r in the volume. In a parallel gravity field the force f at each point r is given by, : \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = -dm\\\\, g\\\\vec{k}= -\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r})dV\\\\,g\\\\vec{k}, where dm is the mass at the point r, g is the acceleration of gravity, and k is a unit vector defining the vertical direction. Choose a reference point R in the volume and compute the resultant force and torque at this point, : \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q} \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{r})dV = \\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q}\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r})dV( -g\\\\vec{k}) = -Mg\\\\vec{k}, and : \\\\mathbf{T} = \\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q} (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{r})dV = \\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q} (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times (-g\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r})dV\\\\vec{k} )= \\\\left(\\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q} \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R})dV \\\\right)\\\\times (-g\\\\vec{k}) . If the reference point R is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then : \\\\iiint\\\\limits_{Q} \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) (\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R})dV =0, which means the resultant torque T=0. Because the resultant torque is zero the body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the center of mass. By selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass. Linear and angular momentum The linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified by measuring the position and velocity of the particles relative to the center of mass. Let the system of particles Pi, i=1,...,n of masses mi be located at the coordinates ri with velocities vi. Select a reference point R and compute the relative position and velocity vectors, : \\\\mathbf{r}_i = (\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}) + \\\\mathbf{R}, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{v}_i = \\\\frac{d}{dt}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}) + \\\\mathbf{v}. The total linear momentum and angular momentum of the system are : \\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R})\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{v}, and : \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\\\mathbf{r}_i-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times \\\\frac{d}{dt}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}) + \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\right) \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{R} \\\\times \\\\frac{d}{dt}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}) + (\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\right] + \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\right)\\\\mathbf{R} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} If R is chosen as the center of mass these equations simplify to : \\\\mathbf{p} = m\\\\mathbf{v},\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\\\mathbf{r}_i-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times \\\\frac{d}{dt}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} where m is the total mass of all the particles, p is the linear momentum, and L is the angular momentum. The Law of Conservation of Momentum predicts that for any system not subjected to external forces the momentum of the system will remain constant, which means the center of mass will move with constant velocity. This applies for all systems with classical internal forces, including magnetic fields, electric fields, chemical reactions, and so on. More formally, this is true for any internal forces that cancel in accordance with Newton's Third Law. Locating the center of mass Plumb line method The experimental determination of the center of mass of a body uses gravity forces on the body and relies on the fact that in the parallel gravity field near the surface of the earth the center of mass is the same as the center of gravity. The center of mass of a body with an axis of symmetry and constant density must lie on this axis. Thus, the center of mass of a circular cylinder of constant density has its center of mass on the axis of the cylinder. In the same way, the center of mass of a spherically symmetric body of constant density is at the center of the sphere. In general, for any symmetry of a body, its center of mass will be a fixed point of that symmetry. =In two dimensions= An experimental method for locating the center of mass is to suspend the object from two locations and to drop plumb lines from the suspension points. The intersection of the two lines is the center of mass. The shape of an object might already be mathematically determined, but it may be too complex to use a known formula. In this case, one can subdivide the complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers. This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be accounted for as negative masses. A direct development of the planimeter known as an integraph, or integerometer, can be used to establish the position of the centroid or center of mass of an irregular two-dimensional shape. This method can be applied to a shape with an irregular, smooth or complex boundary where other methods are too difficult. It was regularly used by ship builders to compare with the required displacement and center of buoyancy of a ship, and ensure it would not capsize. =In three dimensions= An experimental method to locate the three-dimensional coordinates of the center of mass begins by supporting the object at three points and measuring the forces, F1, F2, and F3 that resist the weight of the object, \\\\mathbf{W} = -W\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{k}} (\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{k}} is the unit vector in the vertical direction). Let r1, r2, and r3 be the position coordinates of the support points, then the coordinates R of the center of mass satisfy the condition that the resultant torque is zero, :\\\\mathbf{T}= (\\\\mathbf{r}_1-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_1+(\\\\mathbf{r}_2-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_2+(\\\\mathbf{r}_3-\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_3=0, or :\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\times(-W\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{k}})= \\\\mathbf{r}_1\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_1+\\\\mathbf{r}_2\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_2+\\\\mathbf{r}_3\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_3. This equation yields the coordinates of the center of mass R* in the horizontal plane as, : \\\\mathbf{R}^* =-\\\\frac{1}{W} \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{k}}\\\\times(\\\\mathbf{r}_1\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_1+\\\\mathbf{r}_2\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_2+\\\\mathbf{r}_3\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_3). The center of mass lies on the vertical line L, given by : \\\\mathbf{L}(t) = \\\\mathbf{R}^* + t\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{k}}. The three-dimensional coordinates of the center of mass are determined by performing this experiment twice with the object positioned so that these forces are measured for two different horizontal planes through the object. The center of mass will be the intersection of the two lines L1 and L2 obtained from the two experiments.  Applications  = Engineering designs =  Automotive applications  Engineers try to design a sports car so that its center of mass is lowered to make the car handle better, that is maintaining traction while executing relatively sharp turns. The characteristic low profile of the U. S. military Humvee was designed in part to allow it tilt farther than taller vehicles, without a rollover, because its low center of mass would stay over the space bounded the four wheels even at angles far from the horizontal.  Aeronautics  The center of mass is an important point on an aircraft, which significantly affects the stability of the aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to be safe to fly, the center of mass must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass is ahead of the forward limit, the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly to the point of being unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing. If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly unstable enough so as to be impossible to fly. The moment arm of the elevator will also be reduced, which makes it more difficult to recover from a stalled condition. For helicopters in hover, the center of mass is always directly below the rotorhead. In forward flight, the center of mass will move forward to balance the negative pitch torque produced by applying cyclic control to propel the helicopter forward; consequently a cruising helicopter flies \\"nose-down\\" in level flight. = Astronomy = Two bodies orbiting their barycenter (red cross) The center of mass plays an important role in astronomy and astrophysics, where it is commonly referred to as the barycenter. The barycenter is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the center of mass where two or more celestial bodies orbit each other. When a moon orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body. For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth, but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710 km (1,062 miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun. If the masses are more similar, e.g., Pluto and Charon, the barycenter will fall outside both bodies. = Rigging and safety = Knowing the location of the center of gravity when rigging is crucial, possibly resulting in severe injury or death if assumed incorrectly. A center of gravity that is at or above the lift point will most likely result in a tip-over incident. In general, the further the center of gravity below the pick point, the more safe the lift. There are other things to consider, such as shifting loads, strength of the load and mass, distance between pick points, and number of pick points. Specifically, when selecting lift points, it's very important to place the center of gravity at the center and well below the lift points. = Body motion = In kinesiology and biomechanics, the center of mass is an important parameter that assists people in understanding their human locomotion. Typically, a human's center of mass is detected with one of two methods: The reaction board method is a static analysis that involves the person lying down on that instrument, and use of their static equilibrium equation to find their center of mass; the segmentation method relies on a mathematical solution based on the physical principle that the summation of the torques of individual body sections, relative to a specified axis, must equal the torque of the whole system that constitutes the body, measured relative to the same axis.

Classical mechanics Mass Mass ","title":"Center of mass"},{"id":"173966","text":"David Hartley (; baptized 21 June 1705 Old Style; died 28 August 1757) was an English philosopher and founder of the Associationist school of psychology. Early life and family history David Hartley was born in 1705 in the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months after his birth. His father, an Anglican clergyman, died when David was fifteen. Hartley was educated at Bradford Grammar School and in 1722 was admitted as a Sizar to Jesus College, Cambridge. He received his BA in 1726 and MA in 1729. In April 1730 he became the first layperson to be Master of Magnus Grammar School (Magnus Church of England Academy), Newark, and it was there that he began to practice medicine. On 21 April 1730, Hartley married Alice Rowley (1705‚Äì31). The couple moved to Bury St Edmunds, and Alice died there giving birth to their son David Hartley (the Younger) (1731‚Äì1813). While in Bury, Hartley met his second wife, Elizabeth Packer (1713‚Äì78), the fifth child and only daughter of Robert Packer (died 1731) and Mary Winchcombe, a wealthy and influential family with estates in Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire, including Donnington Castle, Shellingford, and Bucklebury, Berks. (Mary Winchcombe was the daughter of Sir Henry Winchcombe, Bart., and the sister of Frances, wife of Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke.) Despite the opposition of Elizabeth's family, David and Elizabeth wed on 25 August 1735, after agreeing to a severe set of restrictions that kept the ¬£5,000 Elizabeth received upon her marriage completely out of the hands of her husband.Allen 1999, pp. 35‚Äì37. Their first child, Mary (1736‚Äì1803), was born eleven months later. In 1736 the family moved to London, and then in 1742 to Bath, Somerset. When Elizabeth's last surviving elder brother died without issue in 1746, their son Winchcombe Henry (1740‚Äì94) inherited the family estates, making the family (though not Hartley himself) the possessors of significant wealth. Hartley died in Bath on 28 August 1757. He was buried at St. John the Baptist Church, Old Sodbury, Glos. Education and professional career At Cambridge, Hartley studied with Nicholas Saunderson, who, though blind since infancy, became the fourth Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. Hartley was later instrumental in raising the subscription for the posthumous publication of Saunderson's Elements of Algebra (1740). Upon graduation, Hartley declined to sign the Thirty-nine Articles, a requirement for ordination in the Church of England. Although one point at issue may have been the doctrine of the Trinity, Hartley's main dissent from orthodox teaching was his commitment to universal reconciliation. Writing to his friend Joseph Lister in 1736, Hartley stated he believed ‚ÄúThat Universal Happiness is the Fundamental Doctrine both of Reason & Scripture,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúnothing is so irreconcilable [with] Reason as eternal Punishment, nothing so contrary to all the Intimations God has given us in his Works. Have you read Sr. Is. Newton‚Äôs Commt. upon Danl. & the Apocalypse?\\"Hartley to Lister, 13 March 1736, quoted in Allen 1999, p. 44. For Hartley, on the gates of hell there could be no locks. In the same letter to Lister, Hartley writes that \\"a Man who disregards himself, who entirely abandons Self-Interest & devotes his Labours to the Service of Mankind, or in that beautiful and expressive phrase of the Scriptures, who loves his neighbor as himself is sure to meet with private Happiness.‚ÄùQuoted in Allen 1999, p. 44. This conviction became a guiding principle in Hartley's life, and it led him to devote himself to a various philanthropic projects. These include the publication of Saunderson's Elements of Algebra and the promotion of the shorthand system of his friend John Byrom (a system that Hartley believed could be a ‚Äúuniversal character‚Äù and step toward the creation of a philosophical language).Allen 1999, 231‚Äì33. Moreover, shortly after turning to medicine, Hartley became an advocate of variola inoculation for smallpox. Variolation confers personal immunity, and if widespread would be a ‚Äúservice to mankind‚Äù by furthering herd immunity. However, deliberate infection with the smallpox virus ran the risk of disfigurement or death. (Queen Caroline, wife of George II, was an advocate and had three of their children variolated, but Jonathan Edwards died from it in 1758.) The public good, then, could appear to be at odds with private interest. In his first publication, Some Reasons why the Practice of Inoculation ought to be Introduced into the Town of Bury at Present (1733), Hartley developed a statistical argument to show that the conflict is only apparent, that being inoculated furthers both the public good and a person's self-interest. By the time of his move to London in 1736, Hartley was known other campaigners of variolation, such as Hans Sloane and James Jurin, president of the Royal Society. He also had the support of important Whig families in Suffolk, notably of Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (‚ÄòTurnip‚Äô Townshend). Hartley's daughter Mary wrote that ‚Äúthe old Lord Townshend (then Secretary of State) treated him with as much kindness as he had had been an additional son, and all the sons and daughters as an additional brother‚Äù.Quoted in Allen 1999, p. 53. He was inducted into the Royal Society, and he also became a physician to Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, and his wife. In 1736 he offered to ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù John Byrom to George II.Allen 1999, p. 49. By 1740, Hartley was known to every physician in London and to other medical men throughout Europe. He had thrown himself into a controversial attempt to harmonize private interest and public good. Hartley had started to experience symptoms of ‚Äúthe stone‚Äù (bladder stone) in early 1736. A bladder stone, sometimes as large as an egg, could function as a ball-cock on a toilet tank, causing an inability to urinate, excruciating pain, and sometimes death. (Benjamin Franklin, a sufferer, sometimes had to stand on his head to relieve himself.) Treatment by surgical removal (lithotomy) was a procedure many failed to survive. Hartley thought a Mrs. Joanna Stephens had developed a lithontriptic, an oral medicine that would dissolve a stone in situ. He published Ten Cases of Persons who have Taken Mrs. Stephens‚Äôs Medicines for the Stone (1738), which includes an unsparing account of his own agonies. To make a proprietary medicine freely available to the public, Hartley convinced Parliament to pay Stephens ¬£5,000 for her ‚Äúsecret‚Äù.Allen 1999, p. 61. With Stephens's recipe in hand, Hartley set to work with Stephen Hales, along with two colleagues in France, to locate the medicine's chemically active ingredients. These were slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and Alicant soap (predominantly potassium oleate, like other soaps an alkaline salt of a fatty acid). Hales had shown that some bladder stones rapidly dissolved in boiled soap-lye (caustic potash, potassium hydroxide). What was needed, then, was a safely ingestible preparation that would turn a person's urine alkaline; and this, they concluded, is what the slaked lime and soap combination did. In 1739 Hales won the Copley Medal for his work, and the following year Hartley published their results in a Latin volume, De Lithontriptico, in Basel and Leiden, the latter being home at the time to the foremost medical school in Europe. In 1742 Hartley and his family moved to Bath, Somerset. He continued to practise medicine, and he devoted himself to writing his major work, Observations on Man, His Frame, His Duty, and His Expectations, published in 1749 by Samuel Richardson. He was a vegetarian. Observations on Man: \\"A New and Most Extensive Science\\" Title page from the first edition of the Observations In the 18th century, ‚ÄúObservations‚Äù appears in the titles of scientific works ‚Äî compare Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs Experiments and Observations on Electricity (1751) and Joseph Priestley's Experiments and Observations of Different Kinds of Air (1774). Priestley, Hartley‚Äôs champion, would declare that Hartley‚Äôs work ‚Äúcontains a new and most extensive science. ‚Ä¶ [T]he study of it will be like entering upon a new world. ‚Ä¶‚Äù The science is the science of ‚Äúman,‚Äù and the ‚Äúnew world‚Äù is the one embodied in the human ‚Äúframe‚Äù itself. The result, on the one hand, is a ‚Äúvast haystack of a book.‚Äù As one would expect from a physician with an inquiring mind and active medical practice, Hartley draws together a wide range of observations ‚Äî to name a few, on phantom limbs, savant syndrome, and the experiences and mental development of the blind and the deaf (OM 1, props. 34, 69, 78, 80, and 93).Because the text of the Observations is unchanged throughout the editions, citation is to part, chapter, section, and proposition. The 1791 folio edition numbers all the propositions consecutively, so that prop. 1 of part 2 is given as proposition 100, prop. 2 as 101, etc. On the other hand, just as Newton's law of universal gravitation unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics, Hartley proposed a single ‚Äúlaw‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äúassociation‚Äù ‚Äî to account for any and all observations of ‚Äúman.‚Äù Hartley's many observations are meant to be illustrations of the law. Moreover, ‚Äúassociation‚Äù has explanatory power. For example, in the section ‚ÄúThe Affections by which we rejoice at the Misery of Others‚Äù (OM 1.1.4.97‚Äì98), Hartley presents a detailed analysis of the process by which an abused, bullied child becomes an abusive, bullying adult.See Allen 1999, pp. 19‚Äì21. He traces out how the child's automatic gesture of raising an arm to ward off a blow becomes, through a series of associative substitutions, the fist the adult raises to strike a child. An initial defensive gesture becomes a general aggressive stance, and thus the source of the insulting words and threatening actions by which the adult ‚Äúgoes on multiplying perpetually ‚Ä¶ the occasions of anger and the expressions of it.‚Äù Nonetheless, Hartley believed that it was no-one's destiny to be permanently trapped in such a hell. He was, rather, a religious visionary, and his fundamental belief breathtakingly optimistic: that association ‚Äúhas a tendency to reduce the state of those who have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, back again to a paradisiacal one‚Äù (OM 1.1.2.14, Cor. 9). From this vantage point, Hartley's Observations on Man is a psychological epic, a story of ‚Äúparadise regained‚Äù ‚Äî but an epic describing, ultimately, the life of each human being. Hartley's theories The outlines of Hartley's theory are as follows. Like John Locke, he asserted that, prior to sensation, the human mind is a blank slate. By a growth from simple sensations, those states of consciousness which appear most remote from sensation come into being. And the one law of growth of which Hartley took account was the law of contiguity, synchronous and successive. By this law he sought to explain, not only the phenomena of memory, which others had similarly explained before him, but also the phenomena of emotion, of reasoning, and of voluntary and involuntary action (see Association of Ideas). A friend, associate, and one of his chief advocates, was Joseph Priestley (1733‚Äì1804), the discoverer of oxygen. Priestley was one of the foremost scientists of his age. = Doctrine of vibrations = Hartley's physical theory gave birth to the modern study of the intimate connection of physiological and psychical facts. He believed that sensation is the result of a vibration of the minute particles of the medullary substance of the nerves, to account for which he postulated, with Newton, a subtle elastic ether, rare in the interstices of solid bodies and in their close neighbourhood, and denser as it recedes from them. Pleasure is the result of moderate vibrations, pain of vibrations so violent as to break the continuity of the nerves. These vibrations leave behind them in the brain a tendency to fainter vibrations or \\"vibratiuncles\\" of a similar kind, which correspond to \\"ideas of sensation.\\" This accounts for memory. = Doctrine of associations = The course of reminiscence and of the thoughts generally, when not immediately dependent upon external sensation, is accounted for by the idea that there are always vibrations in the brain on account of its heat and the pulsation of its arteries. The nature of these vibrations is determined by each man's past experience, and by the circumstances of the moment, which causes one or another tendency to prevail over the rest. Sensations which are often associated together become each associated with the ideas corresponding to the others; and the ideas corresponding to the associated sensations become associated together, sometimes so intimately that they form what appears to be a new simple idea, not without careful analysis resolvable into its component parts. = Free will = Starting from a detailed account of the phenomena of the senses, Hartley tried to show how, by the above laws, all the emotions, which he analyses with considerable skill, may be explained. Locke's phrase \\"association of ideas\\" is employed throughout, \\"idea\\" being taken as including every mental state but sensation. He emphatically asserts the existence of pure disinterested sentiment, while declaring it to be a growth from the self- regarding feelings. Voluntary action is explained as the result of a firm connexion between a motion and a sensation or \\"idea,\\" and, on the physical side, between an \\"ideal\\" and a motory vibration. Therefore, in the Freewill controversy Hartley took his place as a determinist. It was only with reluctance, and when his speculations were nearly complete, that he came to a conclusion on this subject in accordance with his theory.

He was sympathetic to the early ideas of the French Revolution and helped Thomas Paine publish the first part of The Rights of Man. Early life Holcroft was born in Orange Court, Leicester Fields, London. His father had a shoemaker's shop and kept riding horses for hire, but he fell into difficulties and was reduced to the status of a hawking pedlar. The son accompanied his parents on their travels. He obtained work as a stable boy at Newmarket, at the stables of Hon. Richard Vernon, where he spent his evenings chiefly on miscellaneous reading and the study of music. He gradually obtained a knowledge of French, German and Italian. When Holcroft's job at the stables came to an end, he returned to assist his father, who had resumed his trade of shoemaker in London. Around 1765, he became a teacher in a small school in Liverpool. However, he failed in an attempt to set up a private school, and instead became the prompter in a Dublin theatre. He went on to act in various strolling companies until 1778, when he produced the play The Crisis; or, Love and Famine, at Drury Lane. Duplicity followed in 1781. Literary and political career Two years later Holcroft went to Paris as correspondent of the Morning Herald. Here he attended the performances of Beaumarchais's Mariage de Figaro until he had memorized the whole. His translation of it, with the title The Follies of the Day, was produced at Drury Lane in 1784. His comedy The Road to Ruin,archive.org his most successful play, was produced in 1792; a revival in 1873 ran for 118 nights. His novels include Alwyn (1780), an account, largely autobiographical, of a strolling comedian, Anna St. Ives (the first British Jacobin novel, published in 1792), and The Adventures of Hugh Trevor (1794‚Äì1797). He also wrote Travels from Hamburg through Westphalia, Holland and the Netherlands to Paris, some volumes of verse, and translations from French and German. One of these was Letters Between Frederic II and M. De Voltaire (1789). Sympathetic to the early ideals of the French Revolution, Holcroft assisted in publishing the first part of Thomas Paine's The Rights of Man in 1791. He joined the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI) in 1792 and was appointed a member of a liaison committee to work with the LCS in early 1794. As a result of his activism, Holcroft was indicted in the autumn of 1794 for high treason and held in Newgate Prison whilst three other treason trials proceeded. In early December 1794 Holcroft was discharged without trial after those cases, against London Corresponding Society secretary Thomas Hardy, and SCI figure John Horne Tooke, resulted in acquittals.For more on Holcroft's activities in the SCI, and the connections between his theatrical and political dissent, see: As one of what Secretary of War William Windham called \\"acquitted felons\\", Holcroft's post-arrest reputation meant that his plays achieved little success after 1795, although he was instrumental in bringing melodrama to Britain at the end of the decade with his Deaf and Dumb (1801) and A Tale of Mystery (1802, an unacknowledged translation of de Pixer√©court's C≈ìlina, ou, l'enfant du myst√®re). Despite a modicum of success with A Tale of Mystery, the remainder of the decade was marked by unsuccessful attempts to return to the public eye. He died in 1809, not long after a deathbed reconciliation with his closest friend from the 1790s (lately estranged), William Godwin. His Memoirs written by Himself and continued down to the Time of his Death, from his Diary, Notes and other Papers, by William Hazlitt, appeared in 1816, and was reprinted, in a slightly abridged form, in 1852. Personal life Thomas Holcroft married four times. From his first wife, whom he married around 1765 and whose name is unknown,There is no proof for saying he married his cousin, half-sister of Major Charles Marsack of Caversham Park. In 1765, Holcroft's cousin Margaretta, daughter of his uncle John Holcroft (or \\"Houldcraft\\") by his second marriage in 1754 with Margaret Marsack, was just ten years old. Till her death in January 1785 she remained unmarried, although a mother of three children by a relationship with William Roome. According to her will (National Archives PROB 11/1126/89, Kew, dated 1 February 1785), \\"Margaretta Holcroft Roome, Spinster of Saint Marylebone, Middlesex\\" named her half-brother Charles Marsack as her executor. he had a daughter Ann (1766‚Äì1841), who in 1797 married Colonel William Tooke Harwood (1757‚Äì1824), a close associate of John Horne Tooke (1736‚Äì1812) and a fervent follower of Joanna Southcott (1750‚Äì1814). In 1772 Holcroft married Matilda Tipler from Nottingham and had with her two children: a son William (1773‚Äì1789), who being only sixteen, committed suicide while attempting to escape to the West Indies after robbing his father of ¬£40 (Memoirs, pp. 140‚Äì142), and a daughter Sophia (1775‚Äì1850), who in 1794 married William Cole, a merchant from Exeter. She resided later at Hamburg, and in 1805, after Cole's death, was married to Georges Danton's cousin Georges Nicholas Mergez (1772‚Äì1846), a general in the Napoleonic army. In 1778, three years after the death of his second wife, Holcroft married Diana Robinson, who died in 1780 after giving birth to a daughter Fanny Margaretta (1780‚Äì1844). Fanny Holcroft was the author of the noted Romantic anti-slavery poem, \\"The Negro\\" (1797), as well as novels such as Fortitude and Frailty (1817) and The Wife and the Lover (1813‚Äì14).Corvey Library catalogue: Retrieved 30 July 2012. From 1805 to 1806, she also translated seven plays (from German, Italian, and Spanish) for her father's \\"Theatrical Recorder\\" and later wrote a melodrama of her own. After nine years as a widower, Holcroft married his fourth wife, Louisa Mercier (1779‚Äì1853), in March 1799. She was the daughter of a longstanding friend, the French dramatist Louis-S√©bastien Mercier (1740‚Äì1814). From this marriage came four sons and two daughters. The daughter Louisa (1801‚Äì1869) became the wife of Carlyle's friend John Badams (Carlyle, Reminiscences, ed. C. E. Norton, 1887, i., pp. 93‚Äì95) in 1828; after Badam's death (1833), she in 1835 married Barham Cole Mergez, her half-sister's Sophia son from her second marriage who in 1846 inherited the title \\"baron\\" from his father. The son Thomas Holcroft Jr. (1803‚Äì1852) was a clerk in the House of Commons and spent several years in India, before becoming a journalist in 1822, who some time was Paris correspondent for the Morning Herald and secretary of the Asiatic Society. The widowed Louisa Mercier Holcroft remarried James Kenney (1780‚Äì1849), the dramatist, in 1812 and became the mother of three sons and three daughters.

Bunyan began his work while in the Bedfordshire county prison for violations of the Conventicle Act of 1664, which prohibited the holding of religious services outside the auspices of the established Church of England. Early Bunyan scholars such as John Brown believed The Pilgrim's Progress was begun in Bunyan's second, shorter imprisonment for six months in 1675,John Brown, John Bunyan: His Life, Times and Work, (1885, revised edition 1928) but more recent scholars such as Roger Sharrock believe that it was begun during Bunyan's initial, more lengthy imprisonment from 1660 to 1672 right after he had written his spiritual autobiography Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, edited with an introduction by Roger Sharrock, (Harmondsworth: Penguins Books, Ltd., 1965), 10, 59, 94, 326‚Äì27, 375. The English text comprises 108,260 words and is divided into two parts, each reading as a continuous narrative with no chapter divisions. The first part was completed in 1677 and entered into the Stationers' Register on 22 December 1677. It was licensed and entered in the \\"Term Catalogue\\" on 18 February 1678, which is looked upon as the date of first publication.\\"The copy for the first edition of the First Part of The Pilgrim's Progress was entered in the Stationers' Register on 22 December 1677 ... The book was licensed and entered in the Term Catalogue for the following Hilary Term, 18 February 1678; this date would customarily indicate the time of publication, or only slightly precede it\\" [John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, James Blanton Wharey and Roger Sharrock, eds., Second Edition, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1960), xxi]. After the first edition of the first part in 1678, an expanded edition, with additions written after Bunyan was freed, appeared in 1679. The Second Part appeared in 1684. There were eleven editions of the first part in John Bunyan's lifetime, published in successive years from 1678 to 1685 and in 1688, and there were two editions of the second part, published in 1684 and 1686.  Plot summary  = First Part = The entire book is presented as a dream sequence narrated by an omniscient narrator. The allegory's protagonist, Christian, is an everyman character, and the plot centres on his journey from his hometown, the \\"City of Destruction\\" (\\"this world\\"), to the \\"Celestial City\\" (\\"that which is to come\\": Heaven) atop Mount Zion. Christian is weighed down by a great burden‚Äîthe knowledge of his sin‚Äîwhich he believed came from his reading \\"the book in his hand\\" (the Bible). This burden, which would cause him to sink into Hell, is so unbearable that Christian must seek deliverance. He meets Evangelist as he is walking out in the fields, who directs him to the \\"Wicket Gate\\" for deliverance. Since Christian cannot see the \\"Wicket Gate\\" in the distance, Evangelist directs him to go to a \\"shining light,\\" which Christian thinks he sees.2 Peter 1:19: \\"a lamp shining in a dark place\\" Christian leaves his home, his wife, and children to save himself: he cannot persuade them to accompany him. Obstinate and Pliable go after Christian to bring him back, but Christian refuses. Obstinate returns disgusted, but Pliable is persuaded to go with Christian, hoping to take advantage of the Paradise that Christian claims lies at the end of his journey. Pliable's journey with Christian is cut short when the two of them fall into the Slough of Despond, a boggy mire-like swamp where pilgrims' doubts, fears, temptations, lusts, shames, guilts, and sins of their present condition of being a sinner are used to sink them into the mud of the swamp. It is there in that bog where Pliable abandons Christian after getting himself out. After struggling to the other side of the slough, Christian is pulled out by Help, who has heard his cries and tells him the swamp is made out of the decadence, scum, and filth of sin, but the ground is good at the narrow Wicket Gate. Burdened Christian flees from home On his way to the Wicket Gate, Christian is diverted by the secular ethics of Mr. Worldly Wiseman into seeking deliverance from his burden through the Law, supposedly with the help of a Mr. Legality and his son Civility in the village of Morality, rather than through Christ, allegorically by way of the Wicket Gate. Evangelist meets the wayward Christian as he stops before Mount Sinai on the way to Mr. Legality's home. It hangs over the road and threatens to crush any who would pass it; also the mountain flashed with fire. Evangelist exposes Worldly Wiseman, Legality, and Civility for the frauds they are: they would have the pilgrim leave the true path by trusting in his own good deeds to remove his burden. Evangelist directs Christian to return to the way to the Wicket Gate, and Christian complies. At the Wicket Gate begins the \\"straight and narrow\\" King's Highway, and Christian is directed onto it by the gatekeeper Goodwill who saves him from Beelzebub's archers at Beelzebub's castle near the Wicket Gate and shows him the heavenly way he must go. In the Second Part, Goodwill is shown to be Jesus himself.Go to section 1.2.3.1 Mr. Sagacity leaves the author To Christian's query about relief from his burden, Goodwill directs him forward to \\"the place of deliverance.\\"A marginal note indicates, \\"There is no deliverance from the guilt and burden of sin, but by the death and blood of Christ\\" cf. Sharrock, page 59. Christian makes his way from there to the House of the Interpreter, where he is shown pictures and tableaux that portray or dramatize aspects of the Christian faith and life. Roger Sharrock denotes them \\"emblems\\".\\"Many of the pictures in the House of the Interpreter seem to be derived from emblem books or to be created in the manner and spirit of the emblem. ... Usually, each emblem occupied a page and consisted of an allegorical picture at the top with underneath it a device or motto, a short Latin verse, and a poem explaining the allegory. Bunyan himself wrote an emblem book, A Book for Boys and Girls (1688) ...\\", cf. Sharrock, p. 375. From the House of the Interpreter, Christian finally reaches the \\"place of deliverance\\" (allegorically, the cross of Calvary and the open sepulchre of Christ), where the \\"straps\\" that bound Christian's burden to him break, and it rolls away into the open sepulcher. This event happens relatively early in the narrative: the immediate need of Christian at the beginning of the story is quickly remedied. After Christian is relieved of his burden, he is greeted by three angels, who give him the greeting of peace, new garments, and a scroll as a passport into the Celestial City. Encouraged by all this, Christian happily continues his journey until he comes upon three men named Simple, Sloth, and Presumption. Christian tries to help them, but they disregard his advice. Before coming to the Hill of Difficulty, Christian meets two well- dressed men named Formality and Hypocrisy who prove to be false Christians that perish in the two dangerous bypasses near the hill, named Danger and Destruction. Christian falls asleep at the arbor above the hill and loses his scroll, forcing him to go back and get it. Near the top of the Hill of Difficulty, he meets two weak pilgrims named Mistrust and Timorous who tell him of the great lions of the Palace Beautiful. Christian frightfully avoids the lions through Watchful the porter who tells them that they are chained and put there to test the faith of pilgrims. Atop the Hill of Difficulty, Christian makes his first stop for the night at the House of the Palace Beautiful, which is a place built by God for the refresh of pilgrims and godly travelers. Christian spends three days here, and leaves clothed with the Armour of God (Eph. 6:11‚Äì18),\\"the whole armour (panoply) of God\\" which stands him in good stead in his battle against the demonic dragon-like Apollyon (the lord and god of the City of Destruction) in the Valley of Humiliation. This battle lasts \\"over half a day\\" until Christian manages to wound and stab Apollyon with his two-edged sword (a reference to the Bible, Heb. 4:12).\\"the whole armor (panoply) of God\\" \\"And with that Apollyon spread his dragon wings and sped away.\\" William Blake: Christian Reading in His Book (Plate 2, 1824‚Äì27) As night falls, Christian enters the fearful Valley of the Shadow of Death. When he is in the middle of the Valley amidst the gloom, terror, and demons, he hears the words of the Twenty-third Psalm, spoken possibly by his friend Faithful: > Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no > evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. (Psalm > 23:4.) As he leaves this valley the sun rises on a new day. Just outside the Valley of the Shadow of Death he meets Faithful, also a former resident of the City of Destruction, who accompanies him to Vanity Fair, a place built by Beelzebub where every thing to a human's taste, delight, and lust is sold daily, where both are arrested and detained because of their disdain for the wares and business of the Fair. Faithful is put on trial and executed by burning at the stake as a martyr. A celestial chariot then takes Faithful to the Celestial City, martyrdom being a shortcut there. Hopeful, a resident of Vanity Fair, takes Faithful's place to be Christian's companion for the rest of the way. Christian and Hopeful then come to a mining hill called Lucre. Its owner named Demas offers them all the silver of the mine but Christian sees through Demas's trickery and they avoid the mine. Afterward, a false pilgrim named By- Ends and his friends, who followed Christian and Hopeful only to take advantage of them, perish at the Hill Lucre, never to be seen or heard from again. On a rough, stony stretch of road, Christian and Hopeful leave the highway to travel on the easier By-Path Meadow, where a rainstorm forces them to spend the night. In the morning they are captured by Giant Despair, who is known for his savage cruelty, and his wife Diffidence; the pilgrims are taken to the Giant's Doubting Castle, where they are imprisoned, beaten and starved. The Giant and the Giantess want them to commit suicide, but they endure the ordeal until Christian realizes that a key he has, called Promise, will open all the doors and gates of Doubting Castle. Using the key and the Giant's weakness to sunlight, they escape. The Delectable Mountains form the next stage of Christian and Hopeful's journey, where the shepherds show them some of the wonders of the place also known as \\"Immanuel's Land\\". The pilgrims are shown sights that strengthen their faith and warn them against sinning, like the Hill Error or the Mountain Caution. On Mount Clear, they are able to see the Celestial City through the shepherd's \\"perspective glass\\", which serves as a telescope. (This device is given to Mercy in the Second Part at her request.) The shepherds tell the pilgrims to beware of the Flatterer and to avoid the Enchanted Ground. Soon they come to a crossroad and a man dressed in white comes to help them. Thinking he is a \\"shining one\\" (angel), the pilgrims follow the man, but soon get stuck in a net and realize their so-called angelic guide was the Flatterer. A true shining one comes and frees them from the net. The Angel punishes them for following the Flatterer and then puts them back on the right path. The pilgrims meet an Atheist, who tells them Heaven and God do not exist, but Christian and Hopeful remember the shepherds and pay no attention to the man. Christian and Hopeful come to a place where a man named Wanton Professor is chained by the ropes of seven demons who take him to a shortcut to the Lake of Fire (Hell). This reminds them of a man named Little Faith, who had been mugged by thieves that stole his jewels, although the thieves did not take Little Faith's scroll. On the way, Christian and Hopeful meet a lad named Ignorance, who believes that he will be allowed into the Celestial City through his own good deeds rather than as a gift of God's grace. Christian and Hopeful meet up with him twice and try to persuade him to journey to the Celestial City in the right way. Ignorance persists in his own way that he thinks will lead him into Heaven. After getting over the River of Death on the ferry boat of Vain Hope without overcoming the hazards of wading across it, Ignorance appears before the gates of Celestial City without a passport, which he would have acquired had he gone into the King's Highway through the Wicket Gate. The Lord of the Celestial City orders the shining ones (angels) to take Ignorance to one of the byways of Hell and throw him in. Christian and Hopeful make it through the dangerous Enchanted Ground (a place where the air makes them sleepy and if they fall asleep, they never wake up) into the Land of Beulah, where they ready themselves to cross the dreaded River of Death on foot to Mount Zion and the Celestial City. Christian has a rough time of it because of his past sins wearing him down, but Hopeful helps him over, and they are welcomed into the Celestial City. = Second Part = A Plan of the Road From the City of Destruction to the Celestial City, Adapted to The Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan, 1821. The Second Part of The Pilgrim's Progress presents the pilgrimage of Christian's wife, Christiana; their sons; and the maiden, Mercy. They visit the same stopping places that Christian visited, with the addition of Gaius' Inn between the Valley of the Shadow of Death and Vanity Fair, but they take a longer time in order to accommodate marriage and childbirth for the four sons and their wives. The hero of the story is Greatheart, a servant of the Interpreter, who is the pilgrims' guide to the Celestial City. He kills four giants called Giant Grim, Giant Maul, Giant Slay-Good, and Giant Despair and participates in the slaying of a monster called Legion that terrorizes the city of Vanity Fair. When Christiana's party leaves Gaius's Inn and Mr. Feeble-Mind lingers in order to be left behind, he is encouraged to accompany the party by Greatheart. Christiana, Matthew, Joseph, Samuel, James, Mercy, Greatheart, Mr. Feeble- Mind, and Mr. Ready-To-Halt come to Bypath-Meadow and, after much fight and difficulty, slay the cruel Giant Despair and the wicked Giantess Diffidence, and demolish Doubting Castle for Christian and Hopeful who were oppressed there. They free a pale man named Mr. Despondency and his daughter named Much- Afraid from the castle's dungeons. When the pilgrims end up in the Land of Beulah, they cross over the River of Death by appointment. As a matter of importance to Christians of Bunyan's persuasion reflected in the narrative of The Pilgrim's Progress, the last words of the pilgrims as they cross over the River of Death are recorded. The four sons of Christian and their families do not cross but remain for the support of the church in that place.  Characters  = First Part = Christian enters the Wicket Gate, opened by Goodwill. Engraving from a 1778 edition printed in England. \\"Beelzebub and them that are with him shoot arrows\\" * Christian, who was born with the name Graceless, the protagonist in the First Part, whose journey to the Celestial City is the plot of the story. * Evangelist, the religious man who puts Christian on the path to the Celestial City. He also shows Christian a book, which readers assume to be the Bible. * Obstinate, one of the two residents of the City of Destruction, who run after Christian when he first sets out, in order to bring him back. Like his name, he is stubborn and is disgusted with Christian and with Pliable for making a journey that he thinks is nonsense. * Pliable, the other of the two, who goes with Christian until both of them fall into the Slough of Despond, a boggy mire composed of the decadence and filthiness of sin and a swamp that makes the fears and doubts of a present and past sinner real. Pliable escapes from the slough and returns home. Like his name, he is insecure and goes along with some things for a little while but quickly gives up on them. * Help, Christian's rescuer from the Slough of Despond. * Mr. Worldly Wiseman, a resident of a place called Carnal Policy, who persuades Christian to go out of his way to being helped by a friend named Mr. Legality and then move to the City of Morality (which focuses salvation on the Law and good deeds instead of faith and love in Jesus Christ). His real advice is from the world and not from God, meaning his advice is flawed and consists of three objectives: getting Christian off the right path, making the cross of Jesus Christ offensive to him, and binding him to the Law so he would die with his sins. Worldly Wiseman has brought down many innocent pilgrims and there will be many more to come. * Goodwill, the keeper of the Wicket Gate through which one enters the \\"straight and narrow way\\" (also referred to as \\"the King's Highway\\") to the Celestial City. In the Second Part, we find that this character is none other than Jesus Christ Himself. * Beelzebub, literally \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" is one of Satan's companion archdemons, who has erected a fort near the Wicket Gate from which he and his soldiers can shoot arrows of fire at those about to enter the Wicket Gate so they will never enter it. He is also the Lord, God, King, Master, and Prince of Vanity Fair. Christian calls him \\"captain\\" of the Foul Fiend Apollyon, who he later met in the Valley of Humiliation. * The Interpreter, the one who has his House along the way as a rest stop for travelers to check in to see pictures and dioramas to teach them the right way to live the Christian life. He has been identified in the Second Part as the Holy Spirit. * Shining Ones, the messengers and servants of \\"the Lord of the Hill,\\" God. They are obviously the holy angels. * Formalist, one of two travelers and false pilgrims on the King's Highway, who do not come in by the Wicket Gate, but climb over the wall that encloses it, at least from the hill and sepulchers up to the Hill Difficulty. He and his companion Hypocrisy come from the land of Vainglory. He takes one of the two bypaths that avoid the Hill Difficulty but is lost. * Hypocrisy, the companion of Formalist and the other false pilgrim. He takes the other of the two bypaths and is also lost. * Timorous, one of two men who try to persuade Christian to go back for fear of the chained lions near the House Beautiful. He is a relative of Mrs. Timorous of the Second Part. His companion is Mistrust. * Watchful, the porter of the House Beautiful. He also appears in the Second Part and receives \\"a gold angel\\" coin from Christiana for his kindness and service to her and her companions. \\"Watchful\\" is also the name of one of the Delectable Mountains' shepherds. * Discretion, one of the beautiful maids of the house, who decides to allow Christian to stay there. * Prudence, another of the House Beautiful maidens. She appears in the Second Part. * Piety, another of the House Beautiful maidens. She appears in the Second Part. * Charity, another of the House Beautiful maidens. She appears in the Second Part. * Apollyon, literally \\"Destroyer;\\" the King, Lord, God, Master, Prince, Owner, Landlord, Ruler, Governor, and Leader of the City of Destruction where Christian was born. He is one of Satan's companion archdemons, who tries to force Christian to return to his domain and service. His battle with Christian takes place in the Valley of Humiliation, just below the House Beautiful. He appears as a huge demonic creature with fish's scales, the mouth of a lion, feet of a bear, second mouth on his belly, and dragon's wings. He takes fiery darts from his body to throw at his opponents. Apollyon is finally defeated when Christian uses the Sword of the Spirit to wound him two times. * \\"Pope\\" and \\"Pagan,\\" giants living in a cave at the end of the fearsome Valley of the Shadow of Death. They are allegories of Roman Catholicism and paganism as persecutors of Protestant Christians. \\"Pagan\\" is dead, indicating the end of pagan persecution with Antiquity, and \\"Pope\\" is alive but decrepit, indicating the then-diminished power and influence of the Roman Catholic pope. In the Second Part, Pagan is resurrected by a demon from the bottomless pit of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, representing the new age of pagan persecution, and Pope is revived of his deadly wounds and is no longer stiff and unable to move, representing the beginning of the Christian's troubles with Roman Catholic popes. * Faithful, Christian's friend from the City of Destruction, who is also going on pilgrimage. Christian meets Faithful just after getting through the Valley of The Shadow of Death. He dies later in Vanity Fair for his strong faith and first reaches the Celestial City. * Wanton, a temptress who tries to get Faithful to leave his journey to the Celestial City. She may be the popular resident of the City of Destruction, Madam Wanton, who hosted a house party for friends of Mrs. Timorous. * Adam the First, \\"the old man\\" (representing carnality and deceit) who tries to persuade Faithful to leave his journey and come live with his three daughters: the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life. * Moses, the severe, violent avenger (representing the Law, which knows no mercy) who tries to kill Faithful for his momentary weakness in wanting to go with Adam the First out of the way. Moses is sent away by Jesus Christ. * Talkative, a pilgrim that Faithful and Christian meet after going through the Valley of the Shadow of Death. He is known to Christian as a fellow resident of the City of Destruction, living on Prating Row. He is the son of Say-Well and Mrs. Talk-About-The-Right Things. He is said to be better-looking from a distance than close up. His enthusiasm for talking about his faith to Faithful deceives him into thinking that he is a sincere man. Christian lets Faithful know about his unsavory past, and in a conversation that Faithful strikes up with him, he is exposed as shallow and hypocritical in his Christianity. * Lord Hate-Good, the evil judge who tries Faithful in Vanity Fair. Lord Hate-Good is the opposite of a judge, he hates right and loves wrong because he does wrong himself. His jury is twelve vicious rogue men. * Envy, the first witness against Faithful who falsely accuses that Faithful shows no respect for their prince, Lord Beelzebub. * Superstition, the second witness against Faithful who falsely accuses Faithful of saying that their religion is vain. * Pick-Thank, the third witness against Faithful who falsely accuses Faithful of going against their prince, their people, their laws, their \\"honorable\\" friends, and the judge himself. * Hopeful, the resident of Vanity Fair, who takes Faithful's place as Christian's fellow traveler. The character Hopeful poses an inconsistency in that there is a necessity imposed on the pilgrims that they enter the \\"King's Highway\\" by the Wicket Gate. Hopeful, did not; however, of him, we read \\"... one died to bear testimony to the truth, and another rises out of his ashes to be a companion with Christian in his pilgrimage.\\" Hopeful assumes Faithful's place by God's design. Theologically and allegorically it would follow in that \\"faith\\" is trust in God as far as things present are concerned, and \\"hope,\\" biblically the same as \\"faith,\\" is trust in God as far as things of the future are concerned. Hopeful would follow Faithful. The other factor is that Vanity Fair is right on the straight and narrow way. Ignorance, in contrast to Hopeful, was unconcerned about the end times of God, unconcerned with true faith in Jesus Christ, and gave false hope about the future. Ignorance was told by Christian and Hopeful that he should have entered the highway through the Wicket Gate. * Mr. By-Ends, a false pilgrim met by Christian and Hopeful after they leave Vanity Fair. He makes it his aim to avoid any hardship or persecution that Christians may have to undergo. He supposedly perishes in the Hill Lucre (a dangerous silver mine) with three of his friends, Hold-the- World, Money-Love, and Save-All, at the behest of Demas, who invites passersby to come and see the mine. A \\"by-end\\" is a pursuit that is achieved indirectly. For By-Ends and his companions, it is the by-end of financial gain through religion. * Demas, a deceiver, who beckons to pilgrims at the Hill Lucre to come and join in the supposed silver mining going on in it. He is first mentioned in the Book of Second Timothy by the disciple Paul when he said, \\"Demas has deserted us because he loved the world\\". Demas tries two ways to trick Christian and Hopeful: first, he claims that the mine is safe and they will be rich, and then he claims that he is a pilgrim and will join them on their journey. Christian, filled with the Holy Spirit, is able to rebuke Demas and expose his lies. * Giant Despair, the savage owner of Doubting Castle, where pilgrims are imprisoned and murdered. He is slain by Greatheart in the Second Part. * Giantess Diffidence, Despair's wife, known to be cruel, savage, violent, and evil like her husband. She is slain by Old Honest in the Second Part. * Knowledge, one of the shepherds of the Delectable Mountains. * Experience, another of the Delectable Mountains shepherds. * Watchful, another of the Delectable Mountains shepherds. * Sincere, another of the Delectable Mountains shepherds. * Ignorance, \\"the brisk young lad\\", (representing foolishness and conceit) who joins the \\"King's Highway\\" by way of the \\"crooked lane\\" that comes from his native country, called \\"Conceit.\\" He follows Christian and Hopeful and on two occasions talks with them. He believes that he will be received into the Celestial City because of his doing good works in accordance with God's will. For him, Jesus Christ is only an example, not a Savior. Christian and Hopeful try to set him right, but they fail. He gets a ferryman, Vain-Hope, to ferry him across the River of Death rather than cross it on foot as one is supposed to do. When he gets to the gates of the Celestial City, he is asked for a \\"certificate\\" needed for entry, which he does not have. The King upon hearing this, then, orders that he be bound and cast into Hell. * The Flatterer, a deceiver dressed as an angel who leads Christian and Hopeful out of their way, when they fail to look at the road map given them by the Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains. * Atheist, a mocker of Christian and Hopeful, who goes the opposite way on the \\"King's Highway\\" because he boasts that he knows that God and the Celestial City do not exist. = Second Part II = * Mr. Sagacity, a guest narrator who meets Bunyan himself in his new dream and recounts the events of the Second Part up to the arrival at the Wicket Gate. * Christiana, wife of Christian, who leads her four sons and neighbor Mercy on pilgrimage. * Matthew, Christian and Christiana's eldest son, who marries Mercy. * Samuel, the second son, who marries Grace, Mr. Mnason's daughter. * Joseph, the third son, who marries Martha, Mr. Mnason's daughter. * James, fourth and youngest son, who marries Phoebe, Gaius's daughter. * Mercy, Christiana's neighbor, who goes with her on pilgrimage and marries Matthew. * Mrs. Timorous, a relative of the Timorous of the First Part, who comes with Mercy to see Christiana before she sets out on pilgrimage. * Mrs. Bat's-Eyes, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. Since she has a bat's eyes, she would be blind or nearly blind, so her characterization of Christiana as blind in her desire to go on pilgrimage is hypocritical. * Mrs. Inconsiderate, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. She characterizes Christiana's departure \\"a good riddance\\" as an inconsiderate person would. * Mrs. Light- Mind, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. She changes the subject from Christiana to gossip about being at a bawdy party at Madam Wanton's home. * Mrs. Know-Nothing, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. She wonders if Christiana will actually go on pilgrimage. * Ill-favoured Ones, two evil characters Christiana sees in her dream, whom she and Mercy actually encounter when they leave the Wicket Gate. The two Ill Ones are driven off by Great-Heart himself. * Innocent, a young serving maid of the Interpreter, who answers the door of the house when Christiana and her companions arrive; and who conducts them to the garden bath, which signifies Christian baptism. * Mr. Greatheart, the guide and bodyguard sent by the Interpreter with Christiana and her companions from his house to their journey's end. He proves to be one of the main protagonists in the Second Part. * Giant Grim, a Giant who \\"backs the [chained] lions\\" near the House Beautiful, slain by Great-Heart. He is also known as \\"Bloody-Man\\" because he has killed many pilgrims or sent them on mazes of detours, where they were lost forever. * Humble-Mind, one of the maidens of the House Beautiful, who makes her appearance in the Second Part. She questions Matthew, James, Samuel, and Joseph about their godly faith and their hearts to the Lord God. * Mr. Brisk, a suitor of Mercy's, who gives up courting her when he finds out that she makes clothing only to give away to the poor. He is shown to be a foppish, worldly-minded person who is double-minded about his beliefs. * Mr. Skill, the godly physician called to the House Beautiful to cure Matthew of his illness, which is caused by eating the forbidden apples and fruits of Beelzebub which his mother told him not to, but he did it anyway. * Giant Maul, a Giant whom Greatheart kills as the pilgrims leave the Valley of the Shadow of Death. He holds a grudge against Greatheart for doing his duty of saving pilgrims from damnation and bringing them from darkness to light, from evil to good, and from Satan, the Devil to Jesus Christ, the Savior. * Old Honest, a pilgrim from the frozen town of Stupidity who joins them, a welcome companion to Greatheart. Old Honest tells the stories of Mr. Fearing and a prideful villain named Mr. Self-Will. * Mr. Fearing, a fearful pilgrim from the City of Destruction whom Greatheart had \\"conducted\\" to the Celestial City in an earlier pilgrimage. Noted for his timidness of Godly Fears such as temptations and doubts. He is Mr. Feeble-Mind's uncle. * Gaius, an innkeeper with whom the pilgrims stay for some years after they leave the Valley of the Shadow of Death. He gives his daughter Phoebe to James in marriage. The lodging fee for his inn is paid by the Good Samaritan. Gaius tells them of the wicked Giant Slay-Good. * Giant Slay-Good, a Giant who enlists the help of evildoers on the King's Highway to abduct, murder, and consume pilgrims before they get to Vanity Fair. He is killed by Greatheart. * Mr. Feeble-Mind, rescued from Slay-Good by Mr. Greatheart, who joins Christiana's company of pilgrims. He is the nephew of Mr. Fearing. * Phoebe, Gaius's daughter, who marries James. * Mr. Ready-to-Halt, a pilgrim who meets Christiana's train of pilgrims at Gaius's door, and becomes the companion of Mr. Feeble-Mind, to whom he gives one of his crutches. * Mr. Mnason, a resident of the town of Vanity, who puts up the pilgrims for a time, and gives his daughters Grace and Martha in marriage to Samuel and Joseph respectively. * Grace, Mnason's daughter, who marries Samuel. * Martha, Mnason's daughter, who marries Joseph. * Mr. Despondency, a rescued prisoner from Doubting Castle owned by the miserable Giant Despair. * Much-Afraid, his daughter. * Mr. Valiant, a pilgrim they find all bloody, with his sword in his hand, after leaving the Delectable Mountains. He fought and defeated three robbers called Faint-Heart, Mistrust, and Guilt. * Mr. Stand-Fast For-Truth, a pilgrim found while praying for deliverance from Madame Bubble. * Madame Bubble, a witch whose enchantments made the Enchanted Ground enchanted with an air that makes foolish pilgrims sleepy and never wake up again. She is the adulterous woman mentioned in the Biblical Book of Proverbs. Mr. Self-Will went over a bridge to meet her and never came back again.  Places in The Pilgrim's Progress  A map of the places Pilgrim travels through on his progress; a fold-out map from an edition printed in England in 1778 * City of Destruction, Christian's home, representative of the world (cf. Isaiah 19:18) * Slough of Despond, the miry swamp on the way to the Wicket Gate; one of the hazards of the journey to the Celestial City. In the First Part, Christian falling into it, sank further under the weight of his sins (his burden) and his sense of their guilt. * Mount Sinai, a frightening mountain near the Village of Morality that threatens all who would go there. * Wicket Gate, the entry point of the straight and narrow way to the Celestial City. Pilgrims are required to enter by way of the Wicket Gate. Beelzebub's castle was built not very far from the Gate. * House of the Interpreter, a type of spiritual museum to guide the pilgrims to the Celestial City, emblematic of Calvary and the tomb of Christ. * Hill Difficulty, both the hill and the road up is called \\"Difficulty\\"; it is flanked by two treacherous byways \\"Danger\\" and \\"Destruction.\\" There are three choices: Christian takes \\"Difficulty\\" (the right way), and Formalist and Hypocrisy take the two other ways, which prove to be fatal dead ends. * House Beautiful, a palace that serves as a rest stop for pilgrims to the Celestial City. It apparently sits atop the Hill Difficulty. From the House Beautiful one can see forward to the Delectable Mountains. It represents the Christian congregation, and Bunyan takes its name from a gate of the Jerusalem temple (Acts 3:2, 10). * Valley of Humiliation, the Valley on the other side of the Hill Difficulty, going down into which is said to be extremely slippery by the House Beautiful's damsel Prudence. It is where Christian, protected by God's Armor, meets Apollyon and they had that dreadful, long fight where Christian was victorious over his enemy by impaling Apollyon on his Sword of the Spirit (Word of God) which caused the Foul Fiend to fly away. Apollyon met Christian in the place known as \\"Forgetful Green.\\" This Valley had been a delight to the \\"Lord of the Hill\\", Jesus Christ, in his \\"state of humiliation.\\" * Valley of the Shadow of Death, a treacherous, devilish Valley filled with demons, dragons, fiends, satyrs, goblins, hobgoblins, monsters, creatures from the bottomless pit, beasts from the mouth of Hell, darkness, terror, and horror with a quicksand bog on one side and a deep chasm/ditch on the other side of the King's Highway going through it (cf. Psalm 23:4). * Gaius' Inn, a rest stop in the Second Part of the Pilgrim's Progress. * Vanity Fair, a city through which the King's Highway passes and the yearlong Fair that is held there. * Plain Ease, a pleasant area traversed by the pilgrims. * Hill Lucre, location of a reputed silver mine that proves to be the place where By-Ends and his companions are lost. * The Pillar of Salt, which was Lot's wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. The pilgrim's note that its location near the Hill Lucre is a fitting warning to those who are tempted by Demas to go into the Lucre silver mine. * River of God or River of the Water of Life, a place of solace for the pilgrims. It flows through a meadow, green all year long and filled with lush fruit trees. In the Second Part the Good Shepherd is found there to whom Christiana's grandchildren are entrusted. * By-Path Meadow, the place leading to the grounds of Doubting Castle. * Doubting Castle, the home of Giant Despair and his Giantess wife, Diffidence; only one key could open its doors and gates, the key Promise. * The Delectable Mountains, known as \\"Immanuel's Land.\\" Lush country from whose heights one can see many delights and curiosities. It is inhabited by sheep and their shepherds, and from Mount Clear one can see the Celestial City. * The Enchanted Ground, an area through which the King's Highway passes that has air that makes pilgrims want to stop to sleep. If one goes to sleep in this place, one never wakes up. The shepherds of the Delectable Mountains warn pilgrims about this. * The Land of Beulah, a lush garden area just this side of the River of Death. * The River of Death, the dreadful river that surrounds Mount Zion, deeper or shallower depending on the faith of the one traversing it. * The Celestial City, the \\"Desired Country\\" of pilgrims, heaven, the dwelling place of the \\"Lord of the Hill\\", God. It is situated on Mount Zion.  Geographical and topographical features behind the fictional places  Scholars have pointed out that Bunyan may have been influenced in the creation of places in The Pilgrim's Progress by his own surrounding environment. Albert FosterAlbert J. Foster, Bunyan's Country: Studies in the Topography of Pilgrim's Progress, (London: H. Virtue, 1911) describes the natural features of Bedfordshire that apparently turn up in The Pilgrim's Progress. Vera Brittain in her thoroughly researched biography of Bunyan, identifies seven locations that appear in the allegory. Other connections are suggested in books not directly associated with either John Bunyan or The Pilgrim's Progress. At least twenty-one natural or man-made geographical or topographical features from The Pilgrim's Progress have been identified‚Äîplaces and structures John Bunyan regularly would have seen as a child and, later, in his travels on foot or horseback. The entire journey from The City of Destruction to the Celestial City may have been based on Bunyan's own usual journey from Bedford, on the main road that runs less than a mile behind his cottage in Elstow, through Ampthill, Dunstable and St Albans, to London. In the same sequence as these subjects appear in The Pilgrim's Progress, the geographical realities are as follows: # The plain (across which Christian fled) is Bedford Plain, which is fifteen miles wide with the town of Bedford in the middle and the river Ouse meandering through the northern half; # The \\"Slough of Despond\\" (a major obstacle for Christian and Pliable: \\"a very miry slough\\") is the large deposits of gray clay, which supplied London Brick's works in Stewartby, which was closed in 2008. On either side of the Bedford to Ampthill road these deposits match Bunyan's description exactly. Presumably, the road was built on the \\"twenty thousand cart loads\\" of fill mentioned in The Pilgrim's Progress;John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 17 However, the area beside Elstow brook, where John grew up, may also have been an early inspiration ‚Äì on the north side of this brook, either side of the path to Elstow was (and still is) boggy and John would have known to avoid straying off the main path. # \\"Mount Sinai\\", the high hill on the way to the village of Morality, whose side \\"that was next the wayside, did hang so much over,\\"John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 20. is the red sandy cliffs just north of Ridgmont (i.e. \\"Rouge Mont\\"); # The \\"Wicket Gate\\" could be the wooden gate at the entrance to the Elstow parish churchSee article on John Bunyan or the wicket gate (small door) in the northern wooden entrance door at the west end of Elstow Abbey Church. # The castle, from which arrows were shot at those who would enter the Wicket Gate, could be the stand- alone belltower, beside Elstow Abbey church. # The \\"House of the Interpreter\\" is the rectory of St John's church in the south side of Bedford, where Bunyan was mentored by the pastor John Gifford; # The wall \\"Salvation\\" that fenced in the King's Highway coming after the House of the InterpreterJohn Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 37. is the red brick wall, over four miles long, beside the Ridgmont to Woburn road, marking the boundary of the Duke of Bedford's estate; # The \\"place somewhat ascending ... [with] a cross ... and a sepulcher\\" is the village cross and well that stands by the church at opposite ends of the sloping main street of Stevington, a small village five miles west of Bedford. Bunyan would often preach in a wood by the River Ouse just outside the village. # The \\"Hill Difficulty\\" is Ampthill Hill, on the main Bedford road, the steepest hill in the county. A sandy range of hills stretches across Bedfordshire from Woburn through Ampthill to Potton. These hills are characterized by dark, dense and dismal woods reminiscent of the byways \\"Danger\\" and \\"Destruction\\", the alternatives to the way \\"Difficulty\\" that goes up the hill;John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 41‚Äì42. # The pleasant arbor on the way up the Hill Difficulty is a small \\"lay-by\\", part way up Ampthill Hill, on the east side. A photo, taken in 1908, shows a cyclist resting there;A. Underwood, Ampthill in old picture postcards, (Zaltbommel, Netherlands: European Library, 1989). # The \\"very narrow passage\\" to the \\"Palace Beautiful\\"John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 45. is an entrance cut into the high bank by the roadside to the east at the top of Ampthill Hill; # The \\"Palace Beautiful\\" is Houghton (formerly Ampthill) House, built in 1621 but a ruin since 1800. The house faced north; and, because of the dramatic view over the Bedford plain, it was a popular picnic site during the first half of the twentieth century when many families could not travel far afield;.A. Underwood, Ampthill in Old Picture Cards, (Zaltbommel, Netherlands: European Library, 1989) The tradesman's entrance was on the south side looking out over the town of Ampthill and towards the Chilterns, the model of \\"The Delectable Mountains\\". There is also an earlier source of inspiration; As a young boy, John would have regularly seen, and been impressed by, \\"Elstow Place\\"‚Äîthe grand mansion behind Elstow Church, built for Sir Thomas Hillersden from the cloister buildings of Elstow Abbey. # The \\"Valley of the Shadow of Death\\" is Millbrook gorge to the west of Ampthill; # \\"Vanity Fair\\" is probably also drawn from a number of sources. Some argue that local fairs in Elstow, Bedford and Ampthill were too small to fit Bunyan's descriptionJohn Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 85‚Äì86. but Elstow's May fairs are known to have been large and rowdy and would certainly have made a big impression on the young Bunyan. Stourbridge Fair, held in Cambridge during late August and early September fits John Bunyan's account of the fair's antiquity and its vast variety of goods soldE. South and O. Cook, Prospect of Cambridge, (London: Batsford, 1985). and sermons were preached each Sunday during Stourbridge Fair in an area called the \\"Dodderey.\\" John Bunyan preached often in Toft, just four miles west of Cambridge, and there is a place known as \\"Bunyan's Barn\\" in Toft,Vera Brittain, In the Steps of John Bunyan, (London: Rich & Cowan, 1949) so it is surmised that Bunyan visited the notable Stourbridge Fair; # The \\"pillar of salt\\", Lot's wife,John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 105. is a weather-beaten statue that looks much like a person-sized salt pillar. It is on small island in the River Ouse just north of Turvey bridge, eight miles west of Bedford near Stevington; # The \\"River of the Water of Life\\", with trees along each bankJohn Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 107. is the River Ouse east of Bedford, where John Bunyan as a boy would fish with his sister Margaret. It might also be the valley of river Flit, flowing through Flitton and Flitwick south of Ampthill; # \\"Doubting Castle\\" is Ampthill Castle, built in the early 15th century and often visited by King Henry VIII as a hunting lodge. Henry, corpulent and dour, may have been considered by Bunyan to be a model for Giant Despair. Amphill Castle was used for the \\"house arrest\\" of Queen Catherine of Aragon and her retinue in 1535‚Äì36 before she was taken to Kimbolton. The castle was dismantled soon after 1660, so Bunyan could have seen its towers in the 1650s and known of the empty castle plateau in the 1670s.A.J. Foster, Ampthill Towers, (London: Thomas Nelson, 1910). Giant Despair was killed and Doubting Castle was demolished in the second part of The Pilgrim's Progress.John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 262‚Äì64. # The \\"Delectable Mountains\\" are the Chiltern Hills that can be seen from the second floor of Houghton House. \\"Chalk hills, stretching fifty miles from the Thames to Dunstable Downs, have beautiful blue flowers and butterflies, with glorious beech trees.\\"J. Hadfield, The Shell Guide to England, (London: Michael Joseph, 1970) Reminiscent of the possibility of seeing the Celestial City from Mount Clear,John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 119. on a clear day one can see London's buildings from Dunstable Downs near Whipsnade Zoo; # The \\"Land of Beulah\\" is Middlesex county north and west of London, which then (over 150 years before modern suburban sprawl started) had pretty villages, market gardens, and estates containing beautiful parks and gardens): \\"woods of Islington to the green hills of Hampstead & Highgate\\";E. Rutherfurd, London: The Novel, (New York: Crown Publishers, 1997). # The \\"very deep river\\"John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 147. is the River Thames, one thousand feet wide at high tide; however, here Bunyan varied from geographical reality and put the city south of the river, and without a bridge. # The \\"Celestial City\\" in London, the physical center of John Bunyan's world‚Äîmost of his neighbors never traveled that far. In the 1670s, after the Great Fire of 1666, London sported a new gleaming city centre with forty Wren churches.H. V. Morton, In Search of London, (London: Methuen & Co., 1952) In the last decade of Bunyan's life (1678‚Äì1688) some of his best Christian friends lived in London, including a Lord Mayor.  Cultural influence  The frontispiece and title-page from an edition printed in England in 1778 The allegory of this book has antecedents in a large number of Christian devotional works that speak of the soul's path to Heaven, from the Lyke-Wake Dirge forward. Bunyan's allegory stands out above his predecessors because of his simple and effective prose style, steeped in Biblical texts and cadences. He confesses his own na√Øvet√© in the verse prologue to the book: Bunyan's inspiration? Due to many similarities‚Äîsome more definite than others‚Äîit could be argued that he had access to Dante's Commedia. The Pilgrim's Progress may, therefore, be a distillation of the entire 'pilgrimage' that the 14th Century Italian penned. Because of the widespread longtime popularity of The Pilgrim's Progress, Christian's hazards‚Äîwhether originally from Bunyan or borrowed by him from the Bible‚Äîthe \\"Slough of Despond\\", the \\"Hill Difficulty\\", \\"Valley of the Shadow of Death\\", \\"Doubting Castle\\", and the \\"Enchanted Ground\\", his temptations (the wares of \\"Vanity Fair\\" and the pleasantness of \\"By-Path Meadow\\"), his foes (\\"Apollyon\\" and \\"Giant Despair\\"), and the helpful stopping places he visits (the \\"House of the Interpreter\\", the \\"House Beautiful\\", the \\"Delectable Mountains\\", and the \\"Land of Beulah\\") have become commonly used phrases proverbial in English. For example, \\"One has one's own Slough of Despond to trudge through.\\" = Context in Christendom = The Pilgrim's Progress was much more popular than its predecessors. Bunyan's plain style breathes life into the abstractions of the anthropomorphized temptations and abstractions that Christian encounters and with whom he converses on his course to Heaven. Samuel Johnson said that \\"this is the great merit of the book, that the most cultivated man cannot find anything to praise more highly, and the child knows nothing more amusing.\\" Three years after its publication (1681), it was reprinted in colonial America, and was widely read in the Puritan colonies. Because of its English Protestant theology, The Pilgrim's Progress shares the then-popular English antipathy toward the Catholic Church. It was published over the years of the Popish Plot (1678‚Äì1681) and ten years before the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and it shows the influence of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments. Bunyan presents a decrepit and harmless giant to confront Christian at the end of the Valley of the Shadow of Death that is explicitly named \\"Pope\\": > Now I saw in my Dream, that at the end of this Valley lay blood, bones, > ashes, and mangled bodies of men, even of Pilgrims that had gone this way > formerly: And while I was musing what should be the reason, I espied a > little before me a Cave, where two Giants, Pope and Pagan, dwelt in old > times, by whose Power and Tyranny the Men whose bones, blood ashes, &c.; lay > there, were cruelly put to death. But by this place Christian went without > much danger, whereat I somewhat wondered; but I have learnt since, that > Pagan has been dead many a day; and as for the other, though he be yet > alive, he is by reason of age, and also of the many shrewd brushes that he > met with in his younger dayes, grown so crazy and stiff in his joynts, that > he can now do little more than sit in his Caves mouth, grinning at Pilgrims > as they go by, and biting his nails, because he cannot come at them.John > Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., Oxford World's Classics > (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 66, 299. When Christian and Faithful travel through Vanity Fair, Bunyan adds the editorial comment: > But as in other fairs, some one Commodity is as the chief of all the fair, > so the Ware of Rome and her Merchandize is greatly promoted in this fair: > Only our English Nation, with some others, have taken a dislike thereat.John > Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., Oxford World's Classics > (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 86, 301. In the Second Part, while Christiana and her group of pilgrims led by Greatheart stay for some time in Vanity, the city is terrorized by a seven- headed beastRevelation 17:1‚Äì18. which is driven away by Greatheart and other stalwarts.John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., Oxford World's Classics (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 258‚Äì59. In his endnotes W.R. Owens notes about the woman that governs the beast: \\"This woman was believed by Protestants to represent Antichrist, the Church of Rome. In a posthumously published treatise, Of Antichrist, and his Ruine (1692), Bunyan gave an extended account of the rise and (shortly expected) fall of Antichrist.\\"John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's Progress, W.R. Owens, ed., Oxford World's Classics (Oxford: University Press, 2003), 318: \\"See Misc. Works, xiii. 421‚Äì504.\\" = Foreign-language versions = African version of Pilgrim's Progress from 1902 Not long after its initial publication, The Pilgrim's Progress was being translated into multiple languages starting with Dutch in 1681, German in 1703 and Swedish in 1727, as well as over eighty African languages. Beginning in the 1850s, illustrated versions of The Pilgrim's Progress in Chinese were printed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Fuzhou and widely distributed by Protestant missionaries. Hong Xiuquan, the leader of the Christianity-inspired Taiping Rebellion, declared that the book was his favorite reading.Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son, 1996. pp. 280‚Äì82 Little did the missionaries who distributed The Pilgrim's Progress know that the foreigners would appropriate it to make sense of their own experiences. Heaven was often a place designed to resemble what they had gone through in life. For example, in South Africa, a version was written where the injustices which took place in that country were reformulated.Hofmeyr, I. (2002). Dreams, Documents and 'Fetishes': African Christian Interpretations of The Pilgrim's Progress. Journal of Religion In Africa, 32(4), 440‚Äì55. There are collections of old foreign language versions of The Pilgrim's Progress at both Elstow's Moot Hall museum, and at the John Bunyan Museum in Mill Street Bedford. = The \\"Third Part\\" = Tender-Conscience, hero of Part Three, awakens from sleep in the palace of Carnal-SecurityThe Third Part of the Pilgrim's Progress was written by an anonymous author; beginning in 1693, it was published with Bunyan's authentic two parts. It continued to be republished with Bunyan's work until 1852.\\"A third part falsely attributed to Bunyan appeared in 1693, and was reprinted as late as 1852,\\" (New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia, vol. 2 under \\"John Bunyan\\" ) This third part presented the pilgrimage of Tender-Conscience and his companions. = Dramatic and musical settings = The book was the basis of a condensed radio adaptation, originally presented in 1942 and starring John Gielgud, which included, as background music, several excerpts from Vaughan Williams' orchestral works. The book was the basis of The Pilgrim's Progress (opera) by Ralph Vaughan Williams, premiered in 1951. The radio version was newly recorded by Hyperion Records in 1990, in a performance conducted by Matthew Best. It again starred Gielgud, and featured Richard Pasco and Ursula Howells. English composer Ernest Austin set the whole story as a huge narrative tone poem for solo organ, with optional 6-part choir and narrator, lasting approximately 2¬Ω hours. Under the name The Similitude of a Dream, the progressive rock band of Neal Morse released a concept album based on The Pilgrim's Progress in November 2016. = Art and Poetry = A number of illustrations created by Henry Melville appear in the Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books under the editorship of Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Each is accompanied by a poem, either by Bernard Barton or by Miss Landon herself. These plates are as follows: * 1835 ** (L. E. L.) ** Christian and Hopeful Escaping from the Doubting Castle (Bernard Barton) ** Christian Got up at the Gate (Bernard Barton) ** The Shepherd Boy in the Valley of Humiliation as (L. E. L.) * 1836 ** The Pilgrims (Bernard Barton) ** The Land of Beulah (Bernard Barton) ** Destruction of the Doubting Castle (Bernard Barton) ** (L. E. L.) * 1837 ** (L. E. L.) The Pilgrim's Progress was a favorite subject among painters in 1840s America, including major figures of the Hudson River School and others associated with the National Academy of Design. Daniel Huntington, Jasper Cropsey, Frederic Edwin Church, Jesse Talbot, Edward Harrison May, and others completed canvases based on the work. Thomas Cole's The Voyage of Life was inspired by The Pilgrim's Progress.Cole was reading The Pilgrim's Progress as he worked on this series. Paul D. Schweizer, \\"The Voyage of Life: A Chronology\\" in Thomas Cole's Voyage of Life (Utica, NY: Munson-Williams- Proctor Institute, 1985). In 1850, Huntington, Cropsey, and Church contributed designs to a moving panorama based on The Pilgrim's Progress, conceptualized by May and fellow artist Joseph Kyle, which debuted in New York and traveled all over the country.Jessica Skwire Routhier, Kevin J. Avery, and Thomas Hardiman Jr., The Painters‚Äô Panorama: Narrative, Art, and Faith in the Moving Panorama of Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress (Hanover: University Press of New England, 2015). A second version of the panorama, organized by Kyle and artist Jacob Dallas, premiered in 1851.Routhier et al, The Painters' Panorama. The second version exists today in the collections of the Saco Museum. = References in literature = Charles Dickens' book Oliver Twist (1838) is subtitled 'The Parish Boy's Progress'. The titular character of The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1839) and his companion Smike start to read it but are interrupted. The title of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1847‚Äì48 novel Vanity Fair alludes to the location in Bunyan's work. Mark Twain gave his 1869 travelogue, The Innocents Abroad, the alternative title The New Pilgrims' Progress. In Twain's later work Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the titular character mentions The Pilgrim's Progress as he describes the works of literature in the Grangerfords' library. Twain uses this to satirize the Protestant Southern aristocracy. E. E. Cummings makes numerous references to it in his prose work, The Enormous Room. Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story, \\"The Celestial Railroad\\", recreates Christian's journey in Hawthorne's time. Progressive thinkers have replaced the footpath by a railroad, and pilgrims may now travel under steam power. The journey is considerably faster, but somewhat more questionable. Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter makes reference to it by way of the author John Bunyan with a metaphor comparing a main character's eyes with the fire depicted in the entrance to Hell in The Pilgrim's Progress. John Buchan was an admirer of Bunyan's, and Pilgrim's Progress features significantly in his third Richard Hannay novel, Mr. Standfast, which also takes its title from one of Bunyan's characters. Alan Moore, in his League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, enlists The Pilgrim's Progress protagonist, Christian, as a member of the earliest version of this group, Prospero's Men, having become wayward on his journey during his visit in Vanity Fair, stepping down an alleyway and found himself in London in the 1670s, and unable to return to his homeland. This group disbanded in 1690 after Prospero vanished into the Blazing World; however, some parts of the text seem to imply that Christian resigned from Prospero's League before its disbanding and that Christian traveled to the Blazing World before Prospero himself. The apparent implication is that; within the context of the League stories; the Celestial City Christian seeks and the Blazing World may in fact be one and the same. In Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, the protagonist Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the novel, and try to follow the good example of Bunyan's Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times to Pilgrim's Progress and liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. A number of chapter titles directly reference characters and places from Pilgrim's Progress. The cartoonist Winsor McCay drew an allegorical comic strip, entitled A Pilgrim's Progress, in the New York Evening Telegram. The strip ran from 26 June 1905 to 18 December 1910. In it, the protagonist Mr. Bunion is constantly frustrated in his attempts to improve his life by ridding himself of his burdonsome valise, \\"Dull Care\\".Canemaker, John (1987), Winsor McCay: His Life and Art, Cross River Press, New York C. S. Lewis wrote a book inspired by The Pilgrim's Progress, called The Pilgrim's Regress, in which a character named John follows a vision to escape from The Landlord, a less friendly version of The Owner in The Pilgrim's Regress. It is an allegory of C. S. Lewis' own journey from a religious childhood to a pagan adulthood in which he rediscovers his Christian God. Henry Williamson's The Patriot's Progress references the title of The Pilgrim's Progress and the symbolic nature of John Bunyan's work. The protagonist of the semi-autobiographical novel is John Bullock, the quintessential English soldier during World War I. The character of Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's novel, Slaughterhouse-5: The Children's Crusade, is a clear homage to a similar journey to enlightenment experienced by Christian, although Billy's journey leads him to an existential acceptance of life and of a fatalist human condition. Vonnegut's parallel to The Pilgrim's Progress is deliberate and evident in Billy's surname. Charlotte Bront√´ refers to Pilgrim's Progress in most of her novels, including Jane Eyre,Bront√´, Charlotte. Jane Eyre. Ed. Richard J. Dunn. WW Norton: 2001. p. 385. Shirley,Bront√´, Charlotte. Shirley. Oxford University Press: 2008. p. 48, 236. and Villette.Bront√´, Charlotte. Villette. Ed. Tim Dolin. Oxford University Press: 2008, pp. 6, 44. Her alterations to the quest-narrative have led to much critical interest, particular with the ending of Jane Eyre.Beaty, Jerome. \\"St. John's Way and the Wayward Reader\\". Bront√´, Charlotte. Jane Eyre. Ed. Richard J. Dunn. WW Norton: 2001. 491‚Äì503 [501] Walt Willis and Bob Shaw's classic science fiction fan novelette, The Enchanted Duplicator, is explicitly modeled on The Pilgrim's Progress and has been repeatedly reprinted over the decades since its first appearance in 1954: in professional publications, in fanzines, and as a monograph. Enid Blyton wrote The Land of Far Beyond (1942) as a children's version of The Pilgrim's Progress. John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath mentions The Pilgrim's Progress as one of an (anonymous) character's favorite books. Steinbeck's novel was itself an allegorical spiritual journey by Tom Joad through America during the Great Depression, and often made Christian allusions to sacrifice and redemption in a world of social injustice. The book was commonly referenced in African American slave narratives, such as \\"Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom\\" by Ellen and William Craft, to emphasize the moral and religious implications of slavery. Hannah Hurnard's novel Hinds' Feet on High Places (1955) uses a similar allegorical structure to The Pilgrim's Progress and takes Bunyan's character Much-Afraid as its protagonist. In Lois McMaster Bujold's The Borders of Infinity (1989), Miles Vorkosigan uses half a page torn from The Pilgrim's Progress as a coded message to his fleet to rescue him and 9,000 others from a POW camp. Sir Walter Scott uses Bunyan's tale in chapter 32 of his novel The Heart of Midlothian (1818) to illustrate the relationship between Madge Wildfire and Jeanie Deans. Madge explains: \\"But it is all over now.‚ÄîBut we'll knock at the gate and then the keeper will admit Christiana, but Mercy will be left out‚Äîand then I'll stand at the door trembling and crying, and then Christiana‚Äîthat's you, Jeanie,‚Äîwill intercede for me. And then Mercy,‚Äîthat's me, ye ken,‚Äîwill faint[.]\\" In Marguerite Young's novel, Miss MacIntosh, My Darling, the titular character always carries a copy of Pilgrim's Progress with her. The structure of the novel is inspired by Pilgrim's Progress too, being composed largely of the narrator's seemingly omniscient reminiscences about other characters' inner lives and dreams.  Dramatizations, music, and film  * In 1850, a moving panorama of Pilgrim's Progress, known as the Bunyan Tableuax or the Grand Moving Panorama of Pilgrim's Progress was painted by Joseph Kyle and Edward Harrison May and displayed in New York; an early copy of this panorama survives and is at the Saco Museum in Maine. * The novel was made into a film, Pilgrim's Progress, in 1912. * In 1950 an hour-long animated version was made by Baptista Films. This version was edited down to 35 minutes and re-released with new music in 1978. As of 2007 the original version is difficult to find, but the 1978 version has been released on both VHS and DVD. * In 1951 the first performance of the opera The Pilgrim's Progress was composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams, at the Royal Opera of Covent Garden * In 1978, another film version was made by Ken Anderson, in which Liam Neeson, in his film debut, played the role of the Evangelist and also appeared as the crucified Christ. Maurice O'Callaghan played Appolyon and Worldly Wiseman, and Peter Thomas played The Pilgrim/Christian. A sequel, Christiana, followed later. * In 1978 a musical based loosely on Bunyan's characters and the story was written by Nick Taylor and Alex Learmont. The musical [originally titled Pilgrim] was produced for the Natal Performing Arts Council under the title \\"Christian!\\" or Follow the Man with the Big Bass Drum in the Holy Glory Band, and ran to capacity houses for the 1979/80 summer season in Durban's Old Alhambra Theatre. The show moved to Johannesburg in March 1980 and ran for a further three months at His Majesty's Theatre. After a substantial re-write Christian! was again mounted at the new Playhouse in Durban for the 1984 Christmas season. The musical has been performed many times since by schools and amateur theatrical groups in South Africa. After 30 years the show is again attracting attention both locally and abroad and the score and libretto are being updated and made more flexible for large and small productions.Nick Taylor [singer/songwriter] & Alex Learmont [film maker and lyricist] * In 1985 Yorkshire Television produced a 129-minute nine-part serial presentation of The Pilgrim's Progress with animated stills by Alan Parry and narrated by Paul Copley entitled Dangerous Journey. * In 1989, Orion's Gate, a producer of Biblical / Spiritual audio dramas produced The Pilgrim's Progress as a six-hour audio dramatization.

The duo consisted of vocalist Marc Almond and instrumentalist David Ball. The band are primarily known for their 1981 hit version of \\"Tainted Love\\" and their platinum-selling debut album Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret. In the United Kingdom, Soft Cell had twelve top 40 hits, including \\"Tainted Love\\" (#1), \\"Torch\\" (#2), \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\", \\"What\\" (both #3), and \\"Bedsitter\\" (#4). They also had four top 20 albums between 1981 and 1984. In 1984, the duo split; however, they reformed in 2001 to tour and release a new album and held a final reunion concert in London in 2018. Soft Cell's songs have been covered by various artists, including David Gray, Marilyn Manson, Coil and Nine Inch Nails. Their track \\"Memorabilia\\" earned recognition for the band as pioneers of the synth-oriented techno genre. The duo have sold ten million records world-wide. History =Mutant Moments and \\"Memorabilia\\"= Plaque honouring Soft Cell at Leeds Beckett University (formerly Leeds Polytechnic) Soft Cell was initiated during 1977 after Almond and Ball met at Leeds Polytechnic. Their initial efforts at recording resulted that year in an EP titled Mutant Moments which was funded by a loan of ¬£2,000 from Dave Ball's mother and made with a simple 2-track recorder.Almond, Marc (1999). Tainted Life. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. . Soft Cell's next recording, \\"The Girl with the Patent Leather Face\\", appeared as a contribution to the Some Bizzare Album, which featured bands such as Depeche Mode, The The, and Blancmange. The duo ultimately signed to the Some Bizzare label, backed by Phonogram Records. Their first single, \\"A Man Could Get Lost\\" b/w \\"Memorabilia\\" on 7\\" and \\"Memorabilia\\" b/w \\"Persuasion\\" on 12\\", was produced by Daniel Miller who founded Mute Records. While \\"Memorabilia\\" was a success in nightclubs, Soft Cell would remain essentially unknown until their next release. =\\"Tainted Love\\"= After the chart failure of \\"Memorabilia\\", Phonogram Records allowed Soft Cell to record a second and final single in an attempt to score a chart success. The band opted to record a cover version of \\"Tainted Love\\", an obscure 1965 northern soul track originally released by Gloria Jones (the girlfriend of Marc Bolan at the time of his death) and written by Ed Cobb of The Four Preps. Released in 1981, Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\" was a No. 1 hit in 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, as well as a No. 8 single in the United States during 1982, and went on to set a Guinness World Record at the time for the longest consecutive stay (43 weeks) on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song's popularity developed slowly, needing 19 weeks to enter the US Top 40. The A-side of the 12-inch single of \\"Tainted Love\\" actually featured a two-song medley, with \\"Tainted Love\\" blending into the Motown classic \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\" (originally recorded by the Supremes, in 1964). =Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret= The duo's first album, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, hit UK No. 5 and further explored the now-trademark Soft Cell themes of squalor and sleaze. \\"Seedy Films\\" talks of long nights in porno cinemas, while \\"Frustration\\" and \\"Secret Life\\" deal with the boredom and hypocrisy associated with suburban life. A companion video titled Non-Stop Exotic Video Show was released alongside the album and featured videos directed by Tim Pope. The video generated some controversy in Britain, mainly due to a scandal involved with the \\"Sex Dwarf\\" clip. The original version of the music video was confiscated by police and censored before it was even released. Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret garnered two additional hits: \\"Bedsitter\\" dealt with the loneliness and lifestyle of a young man having recently left home to live in a bedsit while partying hard. \\"Bedsitter\\" reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1981. The song was highly acclaimed in a retrospective review by AllMusic journalist Ned Raggett who wrote that it \\"ranks as one of the best, most realistic portrayals of urban life recorded.\\" The final single on the album, the ballad \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\", peaked at No. 3 in February 1982 and was subsequently covered by David Gray nearly 20 years later when his version reached No. 26 in the UK. During 1982, the duo spent most of their time recording and relaxing in New York City, where they met a woman named Cindy Ecstasy whom Almond would later confirm was his drug supplier (it was Cindy Ecstasy who introduced them to the new nightclub drug of the same name). Soon after \\"Say Hello Wave Goodbye\\" dropped out of the chart, Soft Cell released a brand new song: \\"Torch\\", a love song which was to prove the closest the band ever got to having a No. 1 hit with one of their own songs. The song entered straight into the Top 20 and peaked at No. 2. The duo released their second album entitled Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing, a 6-track mini album containing remixes of older material along with their new hit single, \\"What!\\". This was a cover of the 1965 song by Melinda Marx. It was later covered in 1968 by Judy Street, whose version became extremely popular on the Northern Soul scene. Almond later admitted that the album was recorded and mixed under the influence of ecstasy.Interview with Marc Almond BBC TV programme 'Young Guns Go for It' \\"What!\\" placed at No. 101 in the US Charts, but was a major hit in the UK and reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart in August of that year. =Decline and dissolution= By 1983, fame and nearly constant drug use were having a bad effect on the duo. Marc Almond also formed the group Marc and the Mambas, featuring collaborations with The The's Matt Johnson and future Almond collaborator Annie Hogan, as an offshoot to experiment out of the glare of the Soft Cell spotlight. Soft Cell's third album release, appropriately titled The Art of Falling Apart, was a Top 5 hit in the UK but the singles were only modest successes. The first single \\"Where The Heart Is\\" only reached 21, while the double A-side \\"Numbers\\"/\\"Barriers\\" peaked at 25. \\"Numbers\\" also generated controversy due to references in the song to the drug speed. In September 1983, the duo released a new single \\"Soul Inside\\", which returned them to the UK Top 20, but by early 1984 the duo had amicably decided to end Soft Cell. They played farewell concerts at Hammersmith Palais in January, and released one final album called This Last Night in Sodom (UK No. 12) in March. Headed by the duo's final single \\"Down in the Subway\\" (UK No. 24), the album departed from its predecessors by featuring more live drums and guitars than previous albums. =Reunions= Almond and Ball reunited as Soft Cell in 2001 with a series of live dates. They performed at the opening of the Ocean nightclub in London during March 2001. A mini-tour followed later in the year. The track \\"God Shaped Hole\\" featured on the Some Bizzare compilation titled I'd Rather Shout at a Returning Echo than Kid Someone's Listening, released during 2001. A new Soft Cell album, Cruelty Without Beauty, was released during late 2002, followed by a European tour and a small US tour during early 2003. The second single from the album, a cover of The Four Seasons \\"The Night\\", reached No. 39 in the UK. Soft Cell had considered recording \\"The Night\\" in place of \\"Tainted Love\\" during 1981, though keyboardist David Ball stated in a 2003 interview with the BBC, \\"I think history has kind of shown that we did make the right choice [in 1981].\\" In November 2008, the band released a remix album entitled Heat. The album included Soft Cell tracks remixed by such acts as Paul Dakeyne, The Grid, Manhattan Clique, Cicada, Richard X, Ladytron, MHC, Atomizer, Mark Moore, Spektrum, The Dark Poets and many more. In February 2018, Soft Cell announced that they would reunite for one last reunion concert. On 21 August 2018, Almond revealed on the Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2 that Soft Cell were releasing two new tracks ahead of the concert: \\"Northern Lights\\" and \\"Guilty (Cos I Say You Are)\\". Entitled \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\", the reunion concert took place at the O2 Arena in London on 30 September 2018. In 2019 Ball stated that a new Soft Cell album is currently in the works. In May 2019, a new book 'To Show You, I've Been There' was released, which came with a vinyl copy of the Magick Mutants EP, a sequel to their debut Mutant Moments EP. For June 2020, the Mutant Moments EP is to have its first official release. Originally to be part of the UK June Record Store Day 2020, the 10 inch EP is now to be sold directly through the band's website, as the event was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Influences The group cited David Bowie, Marc Bolan and Suicide as primary influences. Almond also named Siouxsie Sioux as a major influence for his early performance style.

Born in exile in his mother's native Sicily, he was heir to the House of Orl√©ans from birth. Following his father's succession as King of the French in 1830, he became the Prince Royal and subsequently Duke of Orl√©ans (French: Duc d'Orl√©ans), the title by which he is best known. He died in 1842, never to succeed his father or see the collapse of the July Monarchy and subsequent exile of his family to England. Early life Born in Palermo in September 1810, during his parents' exile, he was given the title Duke of Chartres (and was called Chartres within the family circle). He was baptised Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Henri and known as Ferdinand Philippe in honour of his grandfathers, Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Philippe √âgalit√©. Despite having been born in exile, he held the rank of prince of the blood and was styled Serene Highness. As the eldest son, he was the heir to the title of Duke of Orl√©ans, head of the House of Orl√©ans (a cadet branch of the Bourbons of France descended from the only brother of Louis XIV). The young prince first visited France in 1814 during the First Restoration, settling there more permanently in 1817. In 1819 his father put him in the care of a tutor, M. de Boismilon, at the Coll√®ge Henri- IV. Louis Philippe wished his son to receive a liberal education on a foundation of complete equality with his fellow students. Ferdinand Philippe was highly successful in his studies and took courses at the √âcole polytechnique. After a trip to Great Britain (visiting both England and Scotland) in 1819, he went to Lun√©ville to join the 1er r√©giment de hussards, of which he was made colonel by Charles X in 1824. In September 1824, King Charles X granted him the style \\"Royal Highness\\", a style maintained by Ferdinand Philippe at his father's accession to the throne six years later. July Revolution Ferdinand Philippe with his mother in 1819. His parents' coats of arms can be seen on the column. Painting by Louis Joseph Noyal In 1830, during the July Revolution, the young Duke of Chartres was on garrison duty at Joigny. He made his regiment wear the cockade of France and quickly led them to aid the uprising in Paris. He was temporarily stopped at Montrouge, and entered Paris on 3 August at the head of his regiment. When his father was offered the French throne by the Chamber of Deputies, Prince Ferdinand Philippe received the title of Duke of Orl√©ans, Prince of Orl√©ans, and also became Prince Royal, the heir apparent to the throne. Upon entering the Conseil (at his father's bidding), Ferdinand Philippe, who had something of a temper, criticised the time lost by ministers' prevarications and was frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the doctrinaires, to whom he wished to impart the sentiments of revolutionary youth. When Casimir Periero was nominated president of the Conseil in March 1831, he accepted the post only on condition that Ferdinand Philippe be excluded from the Conseil. In November 1831, the young Duke of Orl√©ans and Mar√©chal d'Empire Nicolas Soult, Duc de Dalmatie, were sent to repress the Canut revolts. He acquitted himself of this difficult task without violence and managed to rapidly appease opponents of the July Monarchy, even gaining a certain popularity. During the cholera outbreak in 1831, he did not hesitate to take real risks in visiting the most sickly patients at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris, accompanied by Casimir Perier (who caught the disease and died). In the eyes of the people and the press he was seen as a generous prince, sincerely preoccupied with the plight of the poor, and he became a sort of icon for the dynastic opposition of politician Odilon Barrot, who saw in him the only prince capable of reconciling modern France's democratic aspirations with the heritage of its monarchical past. On 2 March 1832 he was granted an annual income of 1 million francs under his father's new Civil List. Military career In 1831, under Mar√©chal Count G√©rard, Ferdinand Philippe and his young brother Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours, set out on their first campaign. When the princes entered Belgium in 1831, they eagerly visited the plain of Jemmapes, where their father had fought in 1792. The following year, Ferdinand Philippe returned to Belgium in command of the vanguard brigade of the Arm√©e du Nord. On 20 November 1832 he was before the citadel of Antwerp, and commanded the trenches on the night of 29/30 November. During the attack on the Saint-Laurent Lunette, he launched himself onto the parapet amidst a hail of projectiles to lead the action and arouse his soldiers' courage. In 1835, when Mar√©chal Count Clauzel was sent to Algeria as Governor General, the young Prince Royal asked his father for permission to accompany him, so he could fight the Emir Abd El-Kader. He participated with Clauzel's army in the Battle of Habrah, where he was wounded, and in the capture of Mascara in December 1835. He then participated in the taking of Tlemcen in January 1836. When he returned to Paris, it was with an aura of military glory, and he returned to Algeria in autumn 1839 to take possession of the country's interior (from Constantine to Algiers) for France alongside Mar√©chal Count Val√©e. He left Constantine on 16 October, three days after the second anniversary of the town's capture, and reached Algiers on 2 November via S√©tif and the Iron Gates pass. Abd-el-Kader saw this as a violation of the Treaty of Tafna and unleashed jihad upon the French. This led to an escalation in tension and, ultimately, Algeria's wholesale occupation by France. Ferdinand Philippe set out for Algeria a third time in March 1840, taking with him his younger brother the Duke of Aumale, tutoring him in his first military experience. Present at the battles of Affroun, Oued'Ger and Bois des Oliviers, he was put in charge of directing the attackers in the capture of Teniah de Mouza√Øa. After this campaign he was recalled to France for good. This brilliant military career increased his popularity and prestige. He also devoted himself to the improvement of the troops' living conditions and morale. At Saint-Omer he organised the chasseurs de Vincennes, who became the chasseurs d'Orl√©ans in 1836, and re-formed the chasseurs de Vincennes √† pied. He laid the foundations for a Histoire des R√©giments, commissioned by order of the Minister of War, and began writing the regimental histories of the two regiments he had himself commanded. Marriage negotiations Ferdinand Philippe's marriage had long been one of the July Monarchy's major political affairs. Had it not been for the 1830 Revolution, he would have married the sister of Henri, Count of Chambord, Mademoiselle (1819‚Äì1864). Her family called off the marriage plans when Ferdinand Philippe's branch of the family 'usurped' the throne. From 1835, after an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Fieschi and his co-conspirators, Ferdinand Philippe's father had been obsessed with the marital prospects of his son, then 25. Blanche-Jos√©phine Le Bascle d'Argenteuil noted, in her Souvenirs, that if the Prince Royal died young after having fathered a male heir, the July Monarchy would be faced with the prospect of a regency, in all its political uncertainty ‚Äì thus, for her, the wisest course consisted of marrying off the King's third son, then the fourth, then the fifth, guaranteeing Louis Philippe descendants, all the while leaving several men around the throne who could take over from him if he died suddenly. At this time the July Monarchy was searching for new allies in Continental Europe so they would not have to depend solely on the United Kingdom. Talleyrand, fresh from renouncing his embassy to London and close to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, pointed in this direction. The King at first envisaged a rapprochement with Russia via W√ºrttemberg. King Wilhelm I, widower of Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, had two daughters of marriageable age, Princesses Marie (born 1816) and Sophie (born 1818). Wilhelm I's sister Catharina had already made an inauspicious French marriage alliance to J√©r√¥me Bonaparte and so Wilhelm declined the proposition as humiliating. He later was to accept Marie's even more humiliating marriage to Count Alfred von Neipperg in 1840. Queen Louise wrote to her parents on Marie's marriage that \\"We see singular things. It was not at all probable that this daughter, who the king of W√ºrttemberg did not wish to give to Chartres for fear of his ending his days [in exile] in America, should end up marrying a miserable little Austrian officer without illustriousness and of very ordinary birth.\\"cited by Guy Antonetti, Op. cit. (p. 756) Louis Philippe next envisaged an alliance with Austria via the marriage of his son to Archduchess Maria Theresa (born 1816), daughter of Archduke Karl, Duke of Teschen (German: Herzog von Teschen). Queen Marie Am√©lie was highly favourable to such a match as she was herself a daughter of an Austrian archduchess (Maria Carolina of Austria), and Archduke Karl was not opposed to it. However, Karl faced determined opponents on two sides ‚Äì Prince Metternich, who did not want to repeat his error in marrying Marie Louise to Napol√©on I, and Archduchess Sophie, a Bavarian princess and sister-in-law of the new Kaiser Ferdinand I, who dominated the Vienna court with her strong personality, and was awaiting her son Franz-Josef's ascent to the imperial throne. France's ambassador to Vienna, the Count of Sainte-Aulaire, who had been put in charge of preparing the ground for an Austrian match, felt the possibility was difficult if not completely impossible. The new President of the Conseil, Adolphe Thiers, dreamed of concluding such a match and becoming a new Duke of Choiseul as the maker of a spectacular reversal in the alliances of Europe. Ferdinand Philippe and his younger brother, the Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours, set out on a European tour on 2 May 1836. Ferdinand Philippe and Queen Marie-Am√©lie got off to a bad start when the young French Prince Royal refused to shave off the proud beard that had set a fashion among French youth. She wrote back to Queen Louise complaining that \\"there was a lack of tact there and of sentiments of convenience that afflicted me. [...] I believe that Leopold I can say to him that a goatee beard on the face of a prince royal is contrary to all German manners. Here, [such a beard] is neither handsome nor fortunate, there it can be fatal.\\"Cited by Guy Antonetti, Op. cit., p. 757 The two French princes were a great success in Berlin and Vienna, staying at the latter from 29 May to 11 June. However, the Marquis de S√©monville commented that \\"everyone has shaken their hand, but no one was close to them\\". Even if the young Prince Royal decidedly liked Archduke Karl and his daughter, Prince Metternich and the Archduchess Sophie put up a major barrage of problems, and news of Thiers (impatient to conclude the match) being on his way was enough to convince Louis Philippe to make a marriage proposal. He was refused, though to play to French susceptibilities the official version was that the refusal was because of the \\"feelings\\" of Archduchess Marie-Th√©r√®se. Queen Louise wrote to her mother on 14 June 1836: \\"I am upset to see that you have thrown your all behind the cause of Austria [...] I have always thought that Chartres was of too high birth to marry she who seems to him the most minor princess in Germany; and I avow that I would better like to see him marry a princess from Lippe or Waldeck who was good and pretty and of robust health, rather than an archduchess of Austria who would bring us all sorts of evils in her dowry. [...] Napoleon, in this situation, was able to make sacrifices to ally himself with Austria; and we all saw what profit he got from it. But we are not upstarts, and have no need of ennobling ourselves by uniting with the house of Lorraine\\". The two young princes returned to France via Italy. At Trent they were received by Her Imperial Majesty Marie Louise, the former Empress Consort of the French, who could not refrain from tears at the similarity between the Prince Royal and her son, the late Duke of Reichstadt. At Milan they stayed with Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria, Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, where they heard the news of Alibaud's assassination attempt on King Louis Philippe on 25 June. After the Austrians' refusal of the match, only two potential Catholic princesses remained (Louis-Philippe confided to one of his familiars \\"I would prefer her to be a Catholic. You believe it is nothing, the Carlists believe it is everything; and I myself believe that it is neither here nor there\\"Cited by Guy Antonetti, Op. cit., p. 782), and these were both very young for marriage (born in 1821): Princess Januaria of Brazil, daughter of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, and the Infanta Isabella of Spain, daughter of the Infante Francisco de Paula, younger brother of King Ferdinand VII. The former was excluded by her remoteness, and the latter due to her family's unfortunate history (her mother Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies, niece of Queen Marie-Am√©lie, was monstrously obese) and her physical appearance (she was red-haired and thin; Queen Louise wrote to Queen Marie-Am√©lie on 21 November 1836 that \\"I send you her portrait, that Leopold found hideous. Her hair especially is frightening in terms of the children she will have. If all her family are ginger, this will afflict them [too]\\".cited by Guy Antonetti, Op. cit., p. 781) Marriage Some possibilities were also seen among the Protestant German princesses. Via his great-niece the Duchess of Dino, Talleyrand suggested Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel (born 1817 to a cousin of the Elector of Hesse and his wife, a Danish princess), whilst Queen Louise suggested Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg (born 1818 to the Duke of Saxe- Altenburg and Princess Amelia of Wurtemberg, and who finally ended up marrying King George V of Hanover in 1843), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (daughter of an elder brother of King Leopold I of the Belgians; she was actually raised a Catholic and married the Prince Royal's younger brother, the Duke of Nemours, in 1840).

However, the negotiators' choice finally came to rest on Duchess Helene Luise Elisabeth of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (known as H√©l√®ne, 1814‚Äì1858), daughter of the late Prince Frederick Louis, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and his wife Princess Caroline Louise of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach. For Ferdinand Philippe, it was a convenient alliance but one without much attraction; Metternich quipped that she was \\"petite but of a good house\\". She was the niece of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia, whose wife was born Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (this did not avoid difficulties for the marriage in Berlin, which the French ambassador there, the Count Bresson, succeeded in resolving). Nicholas I of Russia, for his part, affected disdain of the marriage, proclaiming that such a minor marriage was not worth the trouble to prevent. The Duke of Broglie was sent to Germany as ambassador extraordinary with the aim of presenting the official marriage request and bringing the princess back to France. An anonymous but virulent libel against the House of Orl√©ans was published by a prince of the House of Mecklenburg. That House avoided the marriage, so that Duchess H√©l√®ne was only accompanied to France by her father's third widow, Augusta of Hesse-Homburg. The marriage was celebrated on 30 May 1837 at the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, since Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu√©len, the Archbishop of Paris, had used the pretext of religious differences to forbid it from taking place in Notre Dame de Paris. The civil ceremony occurred in the galerie Henri II on 30 May 1837, presided over by the Baron Pasquier, whom the King rewarded on 27 May by making him Lord Chancellor of France. The Catholic ceremony was presided over by Romain- Fr√©d√©ric Gallard, Bishop of Meaux, in the chapel of Henri IV, whilst the Lutheran one was celebrated by Pastor Cuvier in the Salon Louis Philippe. As his witnesses, Ferdinand Philippe had the four vice-presidents of the Chamber of Peers: Baron S√©guier, Count Portalis, the Duke of Broglie, and the Count de Bastard; the president and four vice presidents of the Chamber of Deputies: Dupin, Jean-Louis Calmon, Delessert, Jacqueminot, Cunin-Gridaine; three mar√©chals: the Duke of Dalmatie, the Count de Lobau and G√©rard, as well as the Prince de Talleyrand, the Duke of Choiseul, and Count Bresson, France's minister to Berlin. The ceremony was well attended, but there was a notable lack of foreign ambassadors, except for Baron de Werther (Prussia), Count Le Hon (Belgium), and the charg√© d'affaires of Mecklembourg. The reception was brilliant; the Duchesse de Maill√© observed: The marriage was very happy and produced two children: Prince Philippe, Count of Paris (1838‚Äì1894), who was Prince Royal, and Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres (1840‚Äì1910). Patron of the arts Ferdinand Philippe loved literature, music, and the fine arts, and had a pronounced taste for collecting, \\"making his choice slowly, like a true lover [of the arts]\\".Anonyme, L'Artiste, 1836, vol. II, p. 164 Each year he spent 100,000 to 150,000 francs from his Civil List allowance on art purchases or cultural patronage. In his vast apartments in the Palais des Tuileries he gathered medieval and Renaissance objects, ceramics by Bernard Palissy, Hispano-Moorish majolica and ceramics, Chinese and Japanese porcelain, and furniture by Caffieri, Oeben, Riesener, and Jacob. \\"The fatherland in danger\\" Lithograph by Ferdinand-Philippe d'Orl√©ans (1830) He was passionate about modern painters, buying several canvasses from Ary Scheffer and Newton Fielding, both of whom had taught Ferdinand Philippe landscape painting from 1822 to 1830. He possessed works by Ferdinand-Victor-Eug√®ne Delacroix (The Prisoner of Chillon, The Assassination of the Bishop of Li√®ge, Hamlet and Horatio in the Graveyard), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (The Defeat of the Cimbri), Eug√®ne Lami, Ernest Meissonnier, and Paul Delaroche. He loved landscapes by painters of the Barbizon school, notably Camille Corot, Paul Huet, and Th√©odore Rousseau. He commissioned Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres to paint Antiochus and Stratonice (1833), bought his ≈ídipus and the Sphinx in 1839, and commissioned his portrait from him in 1840. Himself a talented draughtsman, Ferdinand Philippe made amateur engravings ‚Äì twelve etchings and lithographs by him are known,Henri B√©raldi, Les Graveurs du XIXe si√®cle, vol X, 1890, p. 234-236. including a satire showing the sleeping Gulliver with Lilliputians all round him on foot and on horseback and a sign referring to the alarmist proclamation of 11 July 1792 by the Legislative Assembly that declared the fatherland to be in danger. Death Pradier, after his death mask, 1842, Louvre In 1842, the Duke was scheduled to leave for Saint-Omer to review part of the army of which he had been made the commander that was engaged at the Marne. He planned to travel from the Tuileries Palace to Neuilly-sur-Seine on 13 July 1842 to say goodbye to his family, and, for the sake of expediency, opted for an open carriage. When the horses of his carriage ran out of control at Sablonville in the Hauts-de-Seine d√©partement; he lost his balance and fractured his skull, and, despite the best attentions of his doctors, the 31-year-old Duke died some hours later, surrounded by family members who had rushed to the scene. Alfred de Musset evoked the accident in his poem Le Treize Juillet (in the collection Po√©sies nouvelles). Ferdinand Philippe's funeral service was held in Notre Dame which was covered not in black fabric (of which there wasn't enough) but, at the suggestion of the architect Visconti, black paper. He was interred in an elaborate tomb in the Chapelle Royale, in Dreux, Eure-et-Loir. Deprived of the popular support his eldest son had had, Louis Philippe and his r√©gime fell six years later. He, his family, and Ferdinand Philippe's widow Princess H√©l√®ne went into exile in Great Britain. There, H√©l√®ne died nearly 16 years after her husband, on 18 May 1858 in Richmond, Surrey. Because H√©l√®ne was a Protestant, she could not be buried in the Catholic Chapelle Royale at Dreux. Instead, a room with a separate entrance was built attached to the chapel and a window was opened between her tomb and her husband's. The sculpture of the Protestant princess rests atop her tomb, depicting her reaching through the opening to the tomb of her beloved Catholic prince.

He is sometimes known as the \\"Shakespeare of Divines\\" for his poetic style of expression, and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest prose writers in the English language. He is remembered in the Church of England's calendar of saints with a Lesser Festival on 13 August. Taylor was under the patronage of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. He went on to become chaplain in ordinary to King Charles I as a result of Laud's sponsorship. This made him politically suspect when Laud was tried for treason and executed in January 1644/5 by the Puritan parliament during the English Civil War. After the parliamentary victory over the King, he was briefly imprisoned several times. Eventually, he was allowed to live quietly in Wales, where he became the private chaplain of the Earl of Carbery. After the Restoration, he was made Bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland. He also became vice-chancellor of the University of Dublin.  Early life  Taylor was born in Cambridge, the son of a barber, Nathaniel.Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 He was baptised on 15 August 1613. His father was educated and taught him grammar and mathematics. He was then educated at the Perse School, Cambridge,Cambridge News (The Perse School 400 year anniversary supplement) 16 September 2015, p. 34. before going to Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University where he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1630/1631 and a Master of Arts degree in 1634. The best evidence of his diligence as a student is the enormous learning of which he showed so easy a command in later years. In 1633, although still below the canonical age, he took holy orders, and accepted the invitation of Thomas Risden, a former fellow-student, to supply his place for a short time as lecturer at St Paul's Cathedral.  Career under Laud  Archbishop William Laud sent for Taylor to preach in his presence at Lambeth, and took the young man under his wing. Taylor did not vacate his fellowship at Cambridge before 1636, but he spent, apparently, much of his time in London, for Laud desired that his considerable talents should receive better opportunities of study and improvement than the obligations of constant preaching would permit. In November 1635 he had been nominated by Laud to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford,\\"Jeremy Taylor\\", CCEL where, says Wood (Athen. Oxon., Ed. Bliss, iii. 781), love and admiration still waited on him. He seems, however, to have spent little time there. He became chaplain to his patron the archbishop, and chaplain in ordinary to Charles I.Kiefer, James E., \\"Jeremy Taylor, Bishop and Theoloian\\", Biographical Sketches of memorable Christians of the past At Oxford, William Chillingworth was then busy with his magnum opus, The Religion of Protestants, and it is possible that through his discussions with Chillingworth Taylor may have been turned towards the liberal movement of his age. After two years in Oxford, he was presented, in March 1638, by William Juxon, Bishop of London, to the rectory of Uppingham, in Rutland. There he settled down to the work of a country priest. In the next year he married Phoebe Langsdale, by whom he had six children: William (d.1642), George (?), Richard (the last two died c.1656/7), Charles, Phoebe and Mary.Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 This Mary married Francis Marsh (1626-93), Archbishop of Dublin. In the autumn of the same year he was appointed to preach in St Mary's on the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, and apparently used the occasion to clear himself of a suspicion, which, however, haunted him through life, of a secret leaning to the Roman Catholic position. This suspicion seems to have arisen chiefly from his intimacy with Christopher Davenport, better known as Francis a Sancta Clara, a learned Franciscan friar who became chaplain to Queen Henrietta; but it may have been strengthened by his known connection with Laud, as well as by his ascetic habits. More serious consequences followed his attachment to the Royalist cause. The author of The Sacred Order and Offices of Episcopacy or Episcopacy Asserted against the Arians and Acephali New and Old (1642), could scarcely hope to retain his parish, which was not, however, sequestrated until 1644. Taylor probably accompanied the king to Oxford. In 1643 he was presented to the rectory of Overstone, Northamptonshire, by Charles I. There he would be in close connection with his friend and patron Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton.  Royalist prisoner  Jeremy Taylor with figures representing youth, maturity and old age by Pierre Lombart (1650) During the next fifteen years Taylor's movements are not easily traced. He seems to have been in London during the last weeks of Charles I in 1649, from whom he is said to have received his watch and some jewels which had ornamented the ebony case in which he kept his Bible. He had been taken prisoner with other Royalists in the siege of Cardigan Castle on 4 February 1645. In 1646 he is found in partnership with two other deprived clergymen, keeping a school at Newton Hall, in the parish of Llanfihangel Aberbythych, Carmarthenshire. Here he became private chaplain to and benefited from the hospitality of Richard Vaughan, 2nd Earl of Carbery, whose mansion, Golden Grove, is immortalised in the title of Taylor's still popular manual of devotion, and whose first wife was a constant friend of Taylor. Taylor wrote some of his most distinguished works at Golden Grove. Alice, the third Lady Carbery, was the original of the Lady in John Milton's Comus. Taylor's first wife had died early in 1651. His second wife was Joanna Bridges or Brydges, said to be a natural daughter of Charles I; there is no good evidence for this.Edmund Gosse, 'Jeremy Taylor', 1904. She owned a good estate, though probably impoverished by Parliamentarian exactions, at Mandinam, in Carmarthenshire. Several years following their marriage, they moved to Ireland. From time to time Taylor appears in London in the company of his friend John Evelyn, in whose Diary and correspondence his name repeatedly occurs. He was imprisoned three times: in 1645 for an injudicious preface to his Golden Grove; again in Chepstow Castle, from May to October 1655, on what charge does not appear; and a third time in the Tower in 1657, because of the indiscretion of his publisher, Richard Royston, who had decorated his Collection of Offices with a print representing Christ in the attitude of prayer.

The scope of the work is described on the title-page. it deals with the means and instruments of obtaining every virtue, and the remedies against every vice, and considerations serving to the resisting all temptations, together with prayers containing the whole Duty of a Christian. Holy Dying was perhaps even more popular. A very charming piece of work of a lighter kind was inspired by a question from his friend, Mrs Katherine Phillips (the matchless Orinda), asking How far is a dear and perfect friendship authorised by the principles of Christianity? In answer to this he dedicated to the most ingenious and excellent Mrs Katherine Phillips his Discourse of the Nature, Offices and Measures of Friendship (1657). His Ductor Dubitantium, or the Rule of Conscience . . . (1660) was intended to be the standard manual of casuistry and ethics for the Christian people.J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 86‚Äì88. His works were translated into Welsh by Nathanael Jones.  Bishop in Ireland (Ulster) at the Restoration  He probably left Wales in 1657, and his immediate connection with Golden Grove seems to have ceased two years earlier. In 1658, through the kind offices of his friend John Evelyn, Taylor was offered a lectureship in Lisburn, Co. Antrim, by Edward Conway, 2nd Viscount Conway. At first he declined a post in which the duty as to be shared with a Presbyterian, or, as he expressed it, where a Presbyterian and myself shall be like Castor and Pollux, the one up and the other down, and to which also a very meagre salary was attached. He was, however, induced to take it, and found in his patron's property at Portmore, on Lough Neagh, a congenial retreat. At the Restoration, instead of being recalled to England, as he probably expected and certainly desired, he was appointed to the see of Down and Connor, to which was shortly added the additional responsibility for overviewing the adjacent diocese of Dromore. As bishop he commissioned in 1661 the building of a new cathedral at Dromore for the Dromore diocese. He was also made a member of the Irish privy council and vice-chancellor of the University of Dublin. None of these positions was a sinecure. Of the university he wrote: Accordingly, he set himself vigorously to the task of framing and enforcing regulations for the admission and conduct of members of the university, and also of establishing lectureships. His episcopal labours were still more arduous. There were, at the date of the Restoration, about seventy Presbyterian ministers in the north of Ireland, and most of these were from the west of Scotland, with a dislike for Episcopacy which distinguished the Covenanting party. No wonder that Taylor, writing to James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde shortly after his consecration, should have said, \\"I perceive myself thrown into a place of torment\\". His letters perhaps somewhat exaggerate the danger in which he lived, but there is no doubt that his authority was resisted and his overtures rejected. This was Taylor's golden opportunity to show the wise toleration he had earlier advocated, but the new bishop had nothing to offer the Presbyterian clergy but the alternative of submission to episcopal ordination and jurisdiction or deprivation. Consequently, at his first visitation, he declared thirty-six churches to be vacant; and repossession was secured on his orders. At the same time many of the gentry were apparently won over by his undoubted sincerity and devotedness as well as by his eloquence. With the Roman Catholic element of the population he was less successful. Not knowing the English language, and firmly attached to their traditional forms of worship, they were nonetheless compelled to attend a service they considered profane, conducted in a language they could not understand. As Reginald Heber says Taylor died at Lisburn on 13 August 1667. He was buried at Dromore Cathedral where an Apsidal Chancel was later built over the crypt where he was laid to rest.  Family  Jeremy Taylor is said to have been a lineal descendant of Rowland Taylor, but the assertion has not been proved. Through his daughter, Mary, who married Archbishop Francis Marsh, he had numerous descendants.Burke's Peerage, 1857, p.664: Sir Henry Marsh, Baronet; Burke's Landed Gentry, 1871, Vol. II, p. 888, Marsh of Springmount Notes  References  *  External links   * Brief Biography of Jeremy Taylor (Archive of 13 Aug 2006) * Works of Jeremy Taylor online Church of Ireland Prayers 1613 births 1667 deaths 17th-century Christian mystics People from Cambridge People educated at The Perse School Fellows of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge English non-fiction writers Bishops of Down and Connor (Church of Ireland) Anglican bishops of Dromore English theologians English Anglican theologians Anglican saints Protestant mystics English male non-fiction writers Arminian writers Arminian ministers Arminian theologians ","title":"Jeremy Taylor"},{"id":"174001","text":"Thomas Carlyle Ford (born August 27, 1961) is an American fashion designer and filmmaker.

The Plain Dealer (March 14, 1996).  Fashion career  = Early career = When interviewing for jobs after graduation, Ford said that he had attended The New School's Parsons division, but concealed that he graduated in architecture, and that his work at Chlo√© was a low-level public relations position. Despite his lack of experience in fashion, Ford called American designer Cathy Hardwick every day for a month in hopes of securing a job at her sportswear company. Hardwick eventually agreed to interview him. She later recalled the incident: \\"I had every intention of giving him no hope. I asked him who his favorite European designers were. He said, 'Armani and Chanel.' Months later I asked him why he said that, and he said, 'Because you were wearing something Armani'. Is it any wonder he got the job?\\" Ford worked as a design assistant for Hardwick for two years. In 1988, Ford moved to Perry Ellis, where he knew both Robert McDonald, the company's president, and Marc Jacobs, its designer, socially. He worked at the company for two years, but grew tired of working in American fashion. In a later interview with The New York Times, he commented, \\"If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America. My own culture was inhibiting me. Too much style in America is tacky. It's looked down upon to be too stylish. Europeans, however, appreciate style.\\" At the time, Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling financially and was seeking to strengthen its women's ready-to-wear presence as a part of a brand overhaul. The company's creative director, Dawn Mello said, \\"no one would dream of wearing Gucci\\". In 1990, Mello hired Ford as the brand's chief women's ready-to-wear designer and Ford moved to Milan. \\"I was talking to a lot of people, and most didn't want the job,\\" Mello said. \\"For an American designer to move to Italy to join a company that was far from being a brand would have been pretty risky.\\" Ford and his longtime partner, fashion journalist Richard Buckley, relocated to Milan that September. Ford's role at Gucci rapidly expanded; he was designing menswear within six months, and shoes soon after that. When Richard Lambertson left as design director in 1992, Ford took over his position, heading the brand's ready-to-wear, fragrances, image, advertising, and store design. In 1993, when he was in charge of designing eleven product lines, Ford worked eighteen-hour days. During these years, there were creative tensions between Ford and Maurizio Gucci, the company's chairman and 50% owner. According to Mello, \\"Maurizio always wanted everything to be round and brown, and Tom wanted to make it square and black.\\" Though Maurizio Gucci wanted to fire Ford, Domenico De Sole insisted that he remain. Nonetheless, Ford's work during the early 1990s was primarily behind the scenes; his contributions to Gucci were overshadowed by those of Mello, who was the company's public face. = Creative Director of Gucci and Saint Laurent = Evening dress by Tom Ford for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche. Selected as Dress of the Year for 2004 In 1994, Ford was promoted to Creative Director of Gucci. In his first year at the helm, he introduced Halston-style velvet hipsters, skinny satin shirts and car-finish metallic patent boots. In 1995, he brought in French stylist Carine Roitfeld and photographer Mario Testino to create a series of new ad campaigns for the company. Between 1995 and 1996, sales at Gucci increased by 90%. At one point, Ford was the largest individual shareholder of Gucci stock and options. By 1999, the house, which had been almost bankrupt when Ford joined, was valued at more than $4 billion. When Gucci acquired the house of Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) in 1999, Ford was named Creative Director of that label as well. Saint Laurent did not hide his displeasure with Ford's designs, stating \\"The poor man does what he can.\\" During his time as creative director for YSL, Ford nonetheless won numerous Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards. Like his work at Gucci, which included shaving the letter G in a model's pubic hair, Ford was able to pull the classic fashion house back into the mainstream. His advertising campaigns for the YSL fragrances Opium (with a red-haired Sophie Dahl naked wearing only a necklace and stiletto heels in a sexually suggestive pose) and YSL M7 (with martial arts champion Samuel de Cubber in complete full-frontal nudity) were controversial and provocative. In April 2004, Ford parted ways with the Gucci group after he and CEO Domenico de Sole, who is credited as Ford's partner in Gucci's success, failed to agree with Pinault Printemps Redoute's boss over control of the Group. He has since referred to this experience as \\"devastating\\" and as a \\"midlife crisis\\" because he had \\"put everything into that for fifteen years\\". When Ford left in 2004, Gucci Group was valued at $10 billion. Four people were hired to split the work Ford had done. = Tom Ford label = A Tom Ford boutique in Toronto After leaving Gucci, Ford launched a line of menswear, beauty, eyewear, and accessories in 2006, named after himself, \\"Tom Ford\\". De Sole became chairman of the label. Ford has described \\"the Tom Ford customer\\" as international, cultured, well-traveled, and possessing disposable income. For women, he added \\"strong women, ‚Ä¶ intelligent women who know their own style\\". First Lady Michelle Obama wore an ivory floor-length evening gown designed by Ford to Buckingham Palace in 2011. He has also dressed Beyonc√©, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway, Daniel Craig, Tom Hanks, Johnny Depp, Ryan Gosling, Will Smith, Julianne Moore, Hugh Jackman, Jon Hamm, and Henry Cavill. Ford designed Daniel Craig's suits for his last three James Bond films: Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, and Spectre. In 2013, Ford was mentioned in Justin Timberlake's song \\"Suit & Tie\\", which was a collaboration with Jay Z. Ford created the suits, shirts, and accessories for the Grammy winning \\"Suit & Tie\\" music video. He went on to dress Timberlake's 20/20 Experience World Tour, designing over 600 pieces for the tour. The same year, Jay Z released a song titled \\"Tom Ford\\" with \\"Tom Ford\\" rapped numerous times within the song. Ford responded that he was flattered and \\"it means that one has really penetrated and made an impact on popular culture.\\" Following the song's release, Ford received a huge spike in online search engine queries. The song would go on to sell over a million copies and become certified platinum. In May 2019, Ford's design for an evening gown was featured in the 2019 Met Gala in New York as worn by Hollywood actor Gemma Chan on the runway and staircase of the event.\\"The Exact $88 Eye Shadow Palette Gemma Chan Wore to the 2019 Met Gala\\". Allure. May 7, 2019. = Controversies = Ford has been criticized for using naked women in various ad campaigns. Various journalists asserted that the ads were vulgar, sexist, or objectified women. One ad featured a nude woman holding a bottle of the perfume between her legs. Another featured a naked woman ironing a man's pants while he read a newspaper. A separate ad was banned in Italy. Responding to criticism that he objectified women, Ford stated he is an \\"equal opportunity objectifier\\" and is \\"just as happy to objectify men\\". He argued \\"you can't show male nudity in our culture in the way you can show female nudity\\" and pointed out that he did a male nude ad while at Yves Saint Laurent which got pulled. In 2014, Ford released a new product, called the \\"Penis Pendant Necklace\\". The product caused some controversy, with Christians calling it offensive due to the pendant being shaped similar to a Christian cross or crucifix. Ford replied that \\"it was not meant to be a cross, it was a phallus\\" and \\"people read into things what they want to\\".  Career as a film director  = A Single Man = Ford at the 66th Venice Film Festival, with A Single Man's Julianne Moore and Colin Firth, 2009 In March 2005, Ford announced the launch of his film production company, Fade to Black. In 2009 he made his directorial debut with A Single Man, based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood. The drama stars Colin Firth as an LA-based, gay college professor, alongside Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult and Matthew Goode. The novel was adapted by David Scearce and Ford; Ford was also one of the producers. A Single Man premiered on September 11, 2009, at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, where it was nominated for top award the Golden Lion. Colin Firth was awarded the Volpi Cup as Best Actor for his performance. He won a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and was nominated for an Academy Award,\\"Movie Guide\\" (February 12, 2010) Arlington Heights Daily Herald Golden Globe,\\"Saucy Globes heavy on dark, sober themes\\" (January 17, 2010) Doylestown Intelligencer Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award and won AFI Film of the Year and the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film ‚Äì Wide Release. Other nominations for the film included two further Golden Globe categories: Julianne Moore for Best Supporting Actress, and Abel Korzeniowski for Best Original Score. At the Independent Spirit Awards, the film was nominated for Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay.\\"Spirit Awards 2010  Tom Ford: 'I have always been obsessed by film.'\\", Indiewire, February 17, 2013. Ford and Scearce also received a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. = Nocturnal Animals = In 2015, Ford became attached to direct Nocturnal Animals, an adaptation of the Austin Wright novel Tony and Susan. The film was released in 2016. Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams played the lead roles of Tony and Susan, and Michael Shannon, Armie Hammer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Isla Fisher co-starred. The film received praise from critics, as well as winning the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. The film has an approval rating of 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 143 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10, and the site's critical consensus reading: \\"Well-acted and lovely to look at, Nocturnal Animals further underscores writer-director Tom Ford's distinctive visual and narrative skill.\\"  Personal life  Ford is married to Richard Buckley (b. 1948), a journalist and former editor in chief of Vogue Hommes International; they have been in a relationship since meeting in 1986. The couple have a son, Alexander John \\"Jack\\" Buckley Ford, born in September 2012 via gestational surrogate.http://celebritybabies.people.com/2012/10/05/tom-ford-welcomes-son- alexander-john/ \\"Tom Ford Welcomes Son Alexander John\\", People, October 5, 2012.] The family lived in Italy, where Ford moved from New York in 1990, and in London for 17 years. They live in his residences in New York, Los Angeles, Santa Fe, and London. Ford and Buckley have owned smooth fox terriers, which have appeared on the runway and in his film A Single Man. Ford also has a nephew with whom he shares a strong bond named Alex Ford Davis, the son of his sister. Ford constructed a 24,000-acre private tract designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, in Santa Fe. It is called Cerro Pelon Ranch and has additional structures that were designed by Marmol Radziner. The property also has a fictional town known as Silverado that is used as a filming location for Western movies. He told Vogue he had adopted a vegan diet after viewing a Netflix documentary called What the Health.\\"Tom Ford adopted vegan diet after watching health documentary,\\" Yahoo Media, December 22, 2017. As of 2019, he has been a teetotaler and has been open about using fillers and Botox. He has said in multiple interviews that his first lover was the artist Ian Falconer,\\"Tom Ford, The Marquis de Sex\\" by Michael Hainey, GQ, October 31, 2004, https://www.gq.com/story/tom-ford-gucci-designer-book\\"The Mourning After\\" by Peter Bowen, Filmmaker, http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/winter2010/a-single-man.php who went on to write and illustrate the very popular Olivia the Pig children's book series.

He opposed America's invasion of Iraq in 2003, stating that it made him feel \\"ashamed to be an American\\". His comment drew public criticism within America. He hosted a fundraiser for Obama. He voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US general election. Ford has advocated for federal recognition of same- sex marriage in the United States. In a 2009 interview, he said he preferred the term \\"civil partnership\\" for both opposite-sex and same-sex partnerships, and to leave \\"marriage\\" to religion to decide. Ford maintains a policy of not dressing politicians regardless of party. > I think that whoever is the President, or the First Lady, should be wearing > clothes at a price point that are accessible to most Americans, and wearing > clothes made in America.

Public image and legacy  Ford has been included in several best-dressed lists, such as International Best Dressed List, The Guardians \\"The 50 best- dressed over-50s\\", and British GQs \\"50 Best Dressed Men in Britain 2015\\". He was featured on the cover of the 2011 spring/summer issue of Another Man, giving his opinion on what makes the modern day gentleman. He has been called a \\"fashion icon\\" and a \\"style icon\\", and he was included in \\"All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons\\" list. He won many awards including several VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards and Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Awards. In 2014, the CFDA awarded him the Geoffery Beene Lifetime Achievement Award. While Ford has been in a monogamous relationship for many years, he \\"continues to promote himself with a youthful and sexually charged image\\". He is known for sexy clothes, making provocative statements, and creating racy advertisements. Ford's designs convey a \\"sophisticated sex appeal\\" and he has been credited for \\"bringing sexy back\\". His advertisement campaigns have drawn controversy for use of nudity and \\"provocative sexual imagery\\". Ford is also known to pose with celebrities and models in his ad campaigns. He has been called the \\"King of Sex\\" and \\"the straightest gay man in the world\\". Ford saved Gucci from near bankruptcy and transformed it into a fashion powerhouse. His decade as the creative director was a \\"golden era\\" for Gucci. He turned the brand around, replacing the \\"grunge look\\" with \\"sexy, yet sophisticated, clothes\\".

Biography He was born at Grenoble into a legal family, the youngest of three brothers. His two older brothers Jean and Gabriel took names associated with one of the family's properties at Mably, Loire, and were each known as \\"Bonnot de Mably\\". √âtienne identified with another property at Condillac, Dr√¥me, was known as \\"Bonnot de Condillac\\". Like his brother Gabriel, Condillac took holy orders (1733‚Äì1740) at Saint-Sulpice church in Paris. He was appointed as Abbot of Mureau. Birthplace of de Condillac in 13 Grande Rue √† Grenoble Condillac devoted his whole life, with the exception of an interval as a court-appointed tutor to the court of Parma, to speculative thought. His works are: * ' (1746); * ' (1749); * ' (1754); *' (1755); * a comprehensive Cours d'√©tudes (1767‚Äì1773) in 13 vols., written for the young Duke Ferdinand of Parma, a grandson of Louis XV; * ' (1776); and two posthumous works, * ' (1781) and the unfinished ' (1798). In Paris, Condillac was involved with the circle of Denis Diderot, the philosopher who was co-contributor to the Encyclop√©die. He developed a friendship with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which lasted in some measure to the end of his life. It likely started when Rousseau was a tutor to two of his brother Jean's sons in Lyon‚ÄîJean Bonnot de Mably was then provost of the police and known as Monsieur de Mably. Together with his brother Gabriel, who became the well-known political writer known as Abb√© de Mably, Condillac introduced Rousseau to an intellectual circle. Condillac's relations with unorthodox philosophers did not injure his career. He had already published several works when the French court sent him to Parma to educate the orphan duke, then a child of seven years. On his return from Italy, Condillac was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1768. Contrary to the popular idea that he attended only one meeting, he was a frequent attendee until two years before his death. He spent his later years in retirement at Flux, a small property which he had purchased near Beaugency on the Loire River. He died there on 2 or 3 August 1780. Work Condillac is important both as a psychologist and as having established systematically in France the principles of John Locke. Voltaire had made the English philosopher fashionable. Condillac developed his concept of empirical sensationism, and demonstrated \\"lucidity, brevity, moderation, and an earnest striving after logical method.\\" His first book, the Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines, keeps close to his English master. He accepts with some reluctance Locke's deduction of our knowledge from two sources, sensation and reflection. He uses as his main principle of explanation the association of ideas. His next book, the Trait√© des syst√®mes, is a vigorous criticism of those modern systems which are based upon abstract principles or upon unsound hypotheses. His polemic, which is inspired throughout by Locke, is directed against the innate ideas of the Cartesians, Malebranche's faculty-psychology, Leibniz's monadism and pre-established harmony, and, above all, against the conception of substance set forth in the first part of the Ethics of Baruch Spinoza. By far the most important of his works is the Trait√© des sensations, in which Condillac treats psychology in his own characteristic way. He questioned Locke's doctrine that the senses give us intuitive knowledge of objects, that the eye, for example, naturally judges shapes, sizes, positions, and distances. He believed it was necessary to study the senses separately, to distinguish precisely what ideas are owed to each sense, to observe how the senses are trained, and how one sense aids another. He believed that the conclusion has to be that all human faculty and knowledge are transformed sensation only, to the exclusion of any other principle, such as reflection. The author imagines a statue organized inwardly like a man, animated by a soul which has never received an idea, into which no sense-impression has ever penetrated. He unlocks its senses one by one, beginning with smell, as the sense that contributes least to human knowledge. At its first experience of smell, the consciousness of the statue is entirely occupied by it; and this occupancy of consciousness is attention. The statue's smell-experience will produce pleasure or pain; and pleasure and pain will thenceforward be the master-principle which, determining all the operations of its mind, will raise it by degrees to all the knowledge of which it is capable. The next stage is memory, which is the lingering impression of the smell experience upon the attention: \\"memory is nothing more than a mode of feeling.\\" From memory springs comparison: the statue experiences the smell, say, of a rose, while remembering that of a carnation; and \\"comparison is nothing more than giving one's attention to two things simultaneously.\\" And \\"as soon as the statue has comparison it has judgment.\\" Comparisons and judgments become habitual, are stored in the mind and formed into series, and thus arises the powerful principle of the association of ideas. From comparison of past and present experiences in respect of their pleasure-giving quality arises desire; it is desire that determines the operation of our faculties, stimulates the memory and imagination, and gives rise to the passions. The passions, also, are nothing but sensation transformed. These indications will suffice to show the general course of the argument in the first section of the Trait√© des sensations. He thoroughly developed this idea through the subsequent chapters: \\"Of the Ideas of a Man limited to the Sense of Smell,\\" \\"Of a Man limited to the Sense of Hearing,\\" \\"Of Smell and Hearing combined,\\" \\"Of Taste by itself, and of Taste combined with Smell and Hearing,\\" \\"Of a Man limited to the Sense of Sight.\\" In the second section of the treatise, Condillac invests his statue with the sense of touch, which first informs it of the existence of external objects. In a very careful and elaborate analysis, he distinguishes the various elements in our tactile experiences-the touching of one's own body, the touching of objects other than one's own body, the experience of movement, the exploration of surfaces by the hands: he traces the growth of the statue's perceptions of extension, distance and shape. The third section deals with the combination of touch with the other senses. The fourth section deals with the desires, activities and ideas of an isolated man who enjoys possession of all the senses; and ends with observations on a \\"wild boy\\" who was found living among bears in the forests of Lithuania. The conclusion of the whole work is that in the natural order of things, everything has its source in sensation, and yet that this source is not equally abundant in all men; men differ greatly in the degree of vividness with which they feel. Finally, he says that man is nothing but what he has acquired; all innate faculties and ideas are to be swept away. Modern theories of evolution and heredity have differed from this. Condillac's work on politics and history, in his Cours d'√©tudes, is considered of less interest. In logic, on which he wrote extensively, he is far less successful than in psychology. He enlarges with much iteration on the supremacy of the analytic method; argues that reasoning consists in the substitution of one proposition for another which is identical with it; and lays it down that science is the same thing as a well-constructed language, a proposition which in his , he tries to prove by the example of arithmetic. His logic is limited by his study of sensations and lack of knowledge of science other than mathematics. He rejects the medieval apparatus of the syllogism; but is precluded by his standpoint from understanding the active, spiritual character of thought; nor had he that interest in natural science and appreciation of inductive reasoning which form the chief merit of JS Mill. Some might claim that Condillac's anti-spiritual psychology, with its explanation of personality as an aggregate of sensations, leads straight to atheism and determinism. However, he denies both these consequences. What he says upon religion is always in harmony with his profession; and he vindicated the freedom of the will in a dissertation that has very little in common with the ' to which it is appended. The common reproach of materialism should certainly not be made against him. He always asserts the substantive reality of the soul; and in the opening words of his ', \\"Whether we rise to heaven, or descend to the abyss, we never get outside ourselves‚Äîit is always our own thoughts that we perceive,\\" we have the subjectivist principle that forms the starting-point of Berkeley. Language Condillac considered language as the vehicle by which senses and emotions were transformed into higher mental faculties. He believed that the structure of language reflects the structure of thought, and compared ideas to the sounds of a harpsichord. His theories had a major effect on the development of linguistics. Condillac promoted \\"sensationalism,\\" a theory that says all knowledge comes from the senses and there are no innate ideas. Condillac promoted an expressionist theory of linguistic creation that anticipates the prime features of later thoughts about language by German theorist Johann Gottfried Herder (1744‚Äì1803).George Albert Wells, The Origin of Language: Aspects of the Discussion from Condillac to Wundt (1987) Economics Condillac's 'Le Commerce et le Gouvernement' (published in 1776, the same year as Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations) attempted to place economics in a coherent logical framework. He was a friend of Fran√ßois Quesnay ‚Äì leader of the Physiocrats. Much of Condillac's work reflected mainstream Physiocrats, particularly his analysis of the structure of taxation and proposals for the revival of the economy, but he also proposed another line of argument, claiming that producers work to obtain utility. Most physiocrats rejected utility and the idea was ignored until his 'rediscovery' by Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger in 1871. In his theory of \\"vrai prix\\" [true price], Condillac proposed a theory of human history divided into two phases: progress and decline. Progress is marked by a rational development and use of resources; decline is precipitated by bad behavior from the upper classes that then trickles down to the workers, encouraging excess, luxury, and false prices that harm the masses. Condillac saw the remedy to this as \\"vrai prix,\\" a true price created by the unimpeded interaction of supply and demand, to be achieved by complete deregulation. People would be taught to work toward their best interest in an open market through a reshaping of their perceptions. By advocating of a free market economy in contrast to the prevailing contemporary policy of state control in France, Condillac influenced classical liberal economicsOrain (2006) History Condillac's Histoire ancienne and Histoire moderne (1758‚Äì1767) demonstrated how the experience and observation of the past aided man. History was not a mere retelling of the past, but a source of information and inspiration as well. Reason and critical thinking can improve man's lot and destroy superstition and fanaticism. History thus served as a moral, political, and philosophical textbook which taught man to live better. Thus the two histories present the basic program of the Enlightenment in crystallized form. Legacy As was fitting to a disciple of Locke, Condillac's ideas have had most importance in their effect upon English thought. In matters connected with the association of ideas, the supremacy of pleasure and pain, and the general explanation of all mental contents as sensations or transformed sensations, his influence can be traced upon the Mills and upon Bain and Herbert Spencer. And, apart from any definite propositions, Condillac did a notable work in the direction of making psychology a science; it is a great step from the desultory, genial observation of Locke to the rigorous analysis of Condillac, short-sighted and defective as that analysis may seem to us in the light of fuller knowledge. His method, however, of imaginative reconstruction was by no means suited to English ways of thinking. In spite of his protests against abstraction, hypothesis and synthesis, his allegory of the statue is in the highest degree abstract, hypothetical and synthetic. James Mill, who stood more by the study of concrete realities, put Condillac into the hands of his youthful son with the warning that here was an example of what to avoid in the method of psychology. A modern historian has comparedHobbs, Catherine, Rhetoric on the Margin of Modernity, Vico, Condillac, Monboddo, Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois (2002) Condillac with Scottish Enlightenment philosopher and pre-evolutionary thinker Lord Monboddo, who had a similar fascination with abstraction and ideas. In France Condillac's doctrine, so congenial to the tone of 18th century philosophism, reigned in the schools for over fifty years, challenged only by a few who, like Maine de Biran, saw that it gave no sufficient account of volitional experience. Early in the 19th century, the romantic awakening of Germany had spread to France, and sensationism was displaced by the eclectic spiritualism of Victor Cousin. Condillac's collected works were published in 1798 (23 vols.) and two or three times subsequently; the last edition (1822) has an introductory dissertation by A. F. Th√©ry. The ' has a very long article on Condillac by Naigeon. Biographical details and criticism of the ' in J. P. Damiron's ', tome iii.; a full criticism in V Cousin's ', ser. i. tome iii.

He wrote 6 symphonies, 15 operas, 14 ballet scores and a large body of orchestral, chamber, vocal and instrumental works. He became a violinist in the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and briefly studied under Czech composer and violinist Josef Suk. After leaving Czechoslovakia in 1923 for Paris, Martin≈Ø deliberately withdrew from the Romantic style in which he had been trained. During the 1920s he experimented with modern French stylistic developments, exemplified by his orchestral works Half-time and La Bagarre. He also adopted jazz idioms, for instance in his Kitchen Revue (Kuchy≈àsk√° revue). In the early 1930s he found his main fount for compositional style: neoclassicism, creating textures far denser than those found in composers treating Stravinsky as a model. He was prolific, quickly composing chamber, orchestral, choral and instrumental works. His Concerto Grosso and the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano and Timpani are among his best-known works from this period. Among his operas, Juliette and The Greek Passion are considered the finest. He has been compared to Prokofiev and Bart√≥k in his innovative incorporation of Czech folk elements into his music. He continued using Bohemian and Moravian folk melodies throughout his oeuvre, for instance in The Opening of the Springs (Otv√≠r√°n√≠ stud√°nek). His symphonic career began when he emigrated to the United States in 1941, fleeing the German invasion of France. His six symphonies were performed by all the major US orchestras. Eventually Martin≈Ø returned to live in Europe for two years starting in 1953, then was back in New York until returning to Europe in May 1956. He died in Switzerland in August 1959.  Life  = 1890‚Äì1923: Poliƒçka and Prague = Martin≈Ø as a child playing the violin (c. 1896) The setting of Martin≈Ø's birth was unusual. He was born in the tower of the St. Jakub Church in Poliƒçka, a town in Bohemia, close to the Moravian border. His father Ferdinand, a shoemaker, also worked as the church sexton and town fire watchman. For this, he and his family were allowed to live in the tower apartment. As a small boy Bohuslav was sickly, and frequently had to be carried up the 193 steps to the tower on the back of his father or his older sister. In school he was known to be very shy, and did not participate in the plays or pageants with his classmates. But as violinist, he excelled and developed a strong reputation, giving his first public concert in his hometown in 1905. The townspeople raised enough money to fund his schooling, and in 1906 he left the countryside to begin studies at the Prague Conservatory. Whilst there he fared poorly as a student, showing little interest in the rigid pedagogy, nor the hours of violin practice required. He was far more interested in exploring Prague and learning on his own, attending concerts and reading books on many subjects. This was in contrast to his roommate, Stanislav Nov√°k, who was an excellent student and a brilliant violinist. They frequently attended concerts together at which Martin≈Ø became engrossed in analysing new music, particularly French impressionist works. He could memorize much of it, to the extent that when back in their room, he could write out large parts of the score almost perfectly. Nov√°k became astonished at how meticulously Martin≈Ø could do this. He became convinced that his roommate, while lacking in other subjects, possessed an incredible brain for analysing and memorizing music.Rybka, F. James, p 22. They became friends for life. Dropped from the violin program, Martin≈Ø was moved to the organ department that taught composition, but he was finally dismissed in 1910 for \\"incorrigible negligence\\".Jan Smaczny, \\"Martin≈Ø, Bohuslav\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001), vol. 15, 939. Martin≈Ø spent the next several years living back home in Poliƒçka, attempting to gain some standing in the musical world. He had written several compositions by this time, including the Elegie for violin and piano, and the symphonic poems Angel of Death (Andƒõl smrti) and Death of Tintagiles (Smrt Tintagilova), and submitted samples of his work to Josef Suk, a leading Czech composer. Suk encouraged him to pursue formal composition training, but this would not be possible until years later. In the meantime, he passed the state teaching examination and maintained a studio in Poliƒçka throughout World War I, while continuing to compose and study on his own. It was during this time that he studied the ancient choral hymns of the Bohemian Brethren, which would influence his style and musical scope. As World War I drew to a close and Czechoslovakia was declared an independent republic, Martin≈Ø composed the celebratory cantata Czech Rhapsody (ƒåesk√° rapsodie), which was premiered in 1919 to great acclaim. He toured Europe as a violinist with the National Theatre Orchestra, and in 1920 became a full member of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra that was led by the inspired young conductor V√°clav Talich, who was the first major conductor to promote Martin≈Ø. He also began formal composition study under Suk. During these last years in Prague he completed his first string quartet and two ballets: Who is the Most Powerful in the World? (Kdo je na svƒõtƒõ nejmocnƒõj≈°√≠?) and Istar. = 1923‚Äì40: Paris = Martin≈Ø finally departed for Paris in 1923, having received a small scholarship from the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education. He sought out Albert Roussel, whose individualistic style he respected, and began a series of informal lessons with him. Roussel would teach Martin≈Ø until his death in 1937 by helping him focus and bring order to his compositions, rather than instructing him in a specific style. During his first years in Paris, Martin≈Ø incorporated many of the trends at the time, including jazz, neoclassicism, and surrealism. He was particularly attracted to Stravinsky, whose novel, angular, propulsive rhythms and sonorities reflected the industrial revolution, sports events and motorised transportation.Martinu, Bohuslav, 1924 Texts on Stravinsky, Lucie Berna, editor, Martinu Revue, May‚ÄìAugust 2013, vol XIII, No 2. Ballets were his favorite medium for experimentation, including The Revolt (1925), The Butterfly That Stamped (1926), Le raid merveilleux (1927), La revue de cuisine (1927), and Les larmes du couteau (1928). Martin≈Ø found friends in the Czechoslovak artistic community in Paris and would always retain close ties to his homeland, frequently returning during the summer. He continued to look to his Bohemian and Moravian roots for musical ideas. His best-known work from this time is the ballet ≈†pal√≠ƒçek (1932‚Äì33), which incorporates Czech folk tunes and nursery rhymes. The prime leader of new symphonic music in Paris at this time was Serge Koussevitzsky, who presented the biannual Concerts Koussevitzsky (1921‚Äì29). He became the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1924, but still returned to Paris each summer to conduct his Concerts. In 1927, Martin≈Ø happened to see him at a caf√©, introduced himself, and gave him the score of a symphonic triptych, La bagarre, that was inspired by Charles Lindbergh's recent landing. The maestro was impressed, and scheduled its premiere with the Boston Symphony in November 1927.Safranek, Milos,Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, The Man and his Music, pp. 32‚Äì33. In 1926, Martin≈Ø met Charlotte Quennehen (1894‚Äì1978), a French seamstress from Picardy. She was employed at a large garment factory and, after their romance began, she moved into his small flat and helped to support him. She would become an important force in his life, handling the cuisine and business matters that he found trying. They married in 1931. Culturally, however, the two were quite different, a fact that would cause problems in their marriage over the years.Rybka, pp.62‚Äì63 By 1930, Martin≈Ø had withdrawn from his seven years of experimentation to settle on a neo-classical style. In 1932, he won the Coolidge prize for the best of 145 chamber music works for his String Sextet with Orchestra. This was performed by Koussevitzsky with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1932.Safranek, M. p. 43. Martinu finished his opera Julietta in 1936; this was based upon a surrealistic play by Georges Neveux that he had seen in 1927. Its premiere was given in Prague under V√°clav Talich on 14 March 1938. In 1937, Martin≈Ø became acquainted with a young Czech woman, V√≠tƒõzslava Kapr√°lov√°. Born in Brno in 1915, she was already a highly accomplished musician when she arrived in Paris, supported by a small Czech government grant to study conducting with Charles Munch and composition with Martin≈Ø. Their relationship soon developed beyond that of student-teacher as he fell madly in love with her. After she returned to Czechoslovakia, Martin≈Ø wrote her many long, passionate letters. In one of these, he proposed that he would divorce Charlotte and then take her to America. It was while he was in this distraught, frenzied state that Martin≈Ø composed one of his greatest works, the Double Concerto for two string orchestras, piano and timpani. It was finished just a few days before the Munich Agreement was sealed between Hitler and Chamberlain (30 September 1938).Rybka, FJ pp. 82‚Äì83. After the Munich Agreement, President Edvard Bene≈° began to form a Czechoslovak government in exile set up in France and England. As a significant number of troops became organized into a Czech resistance force, Martin≈Ø tried to join them but was rejected because of his age. However, in 1939, he composed a tribute to this force, the Field Mass for baritone, chorus and orchestra. It was broadcast from England and was picked up in occupied Czechoslovakia. For this, Martin≈Ø was blacklisted by the Nazis and sentenced in absentia. In 1940, as the German army approached Paris, the Martin≈Øs fled. They were sheltered by Charles Munch who had a place near Limoges. Soon, they journeyed on to Aix-en-Provence, where they stayed for six months while trying to find transit out of Vichy France. He was helped by the Czech artistic community, particularly Rudolf Kundera, along with Edmonde Charles-Roux and the Countess Lily Pastr√©. Despite the harsh conditions, he found inspiration in Aix and composed several works, notably the Sinfonietta giocosa. Charlotte wrote: \\"We fell in love with Aix: the delicate murmur of its fountains calmed our agitated feelings and later Bohus was inspired by them.\\"Charlotte Martin≈Ø, My Life with Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, Prague: Orbis, 1978. Finally, on 8 January 1941, they left Marseilles for Madrid and Portugal, eventually reaching the United States in 1941 with the help of his friend, the diplomat Milo≈° ≈†afr√°nek, and especially from Martin≈Ø's Swiss benefactor, Paul Sacher, the conductor of the Basel Chamber Orchestra, who arranged and paid for their passages.Rybka, FJ p 93 = 1941‚Äì53: US = Life in the United States was difficult for him initially, just as it was for many other artist √©migr√©s in similar circumstances. Lack of knowledge of English, of funds, and of opportunities to use their talents were common to them. When they first arrived in New York, the Martin≈Øs rented a studio apartment at the Great Northern Hotel on 57th St. They were helped by several musician friends, including pianist Rudolf Firku≈°n√Ω, violinist Samuel Dushkin, cellist Frank Rybka, diplomat Milo≈° ≈†afr√°nek, and multi-lingual lawyer Jan L√∂wenbach. Martin≈Ø soon found that he was unable to resume composing in noisy Manhattan, so for the following season they leased a small apartment in Jamaica Estates, Queens, close to the Rybkas. This leafy, residential neighborhood was conducive for him to take long solitary walks at night, during which he would work out music scores in his head. On several occasions he would \\"zone out\\" in deep concentration about the music, becoming oblivious of his surroundings and getting lost, and would then call a friend with a car to come find him and take him back home.Rybka, FJ p. 110p Thereafter, he began to compose actively. When he contacted Serge Koussevitzsky, the conductor told him that his Concerto Grosso would receive its premiere in Boston the following season. One of the first compositions Martin≈Ø wrote in New York was the Concerto da Camera for violin and small orchestra, in fulfillment of a commission he had been awarded before the war by Paul Sacher.Rybka, FJ pp. 59, 105 The following year, they moved back to Manhattan into an apartment in a brownstone on 58th St, across from the Hotel Plaza. That was where they lived for the rest of their years in America. Composer David Diamond, who sub-leased this apartment in 1954, has described it in an interview.Rybka, FJ pp. 126‚Äì127. As the War was coming to an end, the Martin≈Øs encountered marital difficulties. Charlotte, who never did like America, wanted strongly to return to France. He did not, so when he accepted Koussevitzky's offer to teach at the Berkshire Music School for the summer of 1946, she went to France alone for a prolonged visit. In Great Barrington, Massachusetts, he was lodged with the students in Searles Castle, and his magnificent master bedroom opened onto a terrace. One night, Martin≈Ø took his customary walk on the terrace, a section of which had no railing, and he fell off, landing on concrete, and was hospitalized with a fractured skull and concussion. He drifted in and out of a coma, but survived. After several weeks he was released to recuperate with friends. By this time, Roe Barstow had entered his life. She was an attractive divorcee of independent means, who lived alone in Greenwich Village. With Charlotte away in France, she was at Martin≈Ø's side, assisting in his recovery, during which their relationship deepened. After Charlotte returned in the late fall, she found that her husband was a different man: gaunt, irritable, crippled and in pain from the accident.Rybka, FJ pp 151‚Äì154, 157, 161‚Äì165. It required a few years before he was able to return to his former state as a solid composer. Apart from his domestic problems, Martin≈Ø was unsure about which country he would live in. He had considered returning to Czechoslovakia as a teacher, despite having a powerful enemy there in the communist politician Zdenƒõk Nejedl√Ω. Any plans to return were further hampered by the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat. With the communists' seizure of power, music, along with the other arts, became an instrument of propaganda along Soviet ideological lines. Martin≈Ø was branded as a formalist and √©migr√© traitor, and he chose wisely not to pursue any kind of professional engagement in his native land from this time forward.Svatos, Thomas, \\"Sovietizing Czechoslovak Music: The \\"Hatchet Man\\" Miroslav Barvik and his Speech,The Composers Go with the People Music and Politics vol IV/1 (2010) 1‚Äì35 Martin≈Ø was indeed reluctant to leave America which had been very supportive of him. He taught at the Mannes College of Music for most of the period from 1948 to 1956. He also taught at Princeton UniversityRybka, FJ pp 182‚Äì87 and the Berkshire Music School (Tanglewood). At Princeton he was warmly received by faculty and students. His six symphonies were written in the eleven-year period 1942‚Äì1953, the first five being produced between 1942 and 1946. In addition, he composed the Violin Concerto No. 2, Memorial to Lidice (Pam√°tn√≠k Lidic√≠m) for orchestra, Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, Piano Concerto No. 3, Concerto da Camera for violin and small orchestra, Sinfonietta La Jolla for piano and small orchestra, Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3 for cello and piano, many chamber compositions, and a television opera, The Marriage (≈Ωenitba). His symphonic scores were performed by most of the major orchestras: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and he generally received fine reviews from the leading critics. Owing to the extraordinary volume of Martin≈Ø's oeuvre, some critics who never knew the man have stated that he composed too much, too fast, and therefore must have been careless in quality. However, he has been defended strongly by musicians and critics who did know him. Olin Downes knew Martin≈Ø better. For his interviews of Martin≈Ø, he had the benefit of having Jan L√∂wenbach, a friend of both men, present as an interpreter. Downes' defense of the composer came out in an article, \\"Martinu at 60\\".The New York Times January 7, 1951. \\"Martinu [‚Ä¶] is incapable of an unthorough or conscienceless job. He works very hard, systematically, scrupulously, modestly. He produces so much music because in the first place, his nature necessitates this. He has to write music. In the second place, he knows his business and loves it.\\"Rybka, FJ, pp. 321‚Äì22. The composer David Diamond knew Martin≈Ø both in Paris and New York. In an interview years later, he expressed amazement at how extraordinary Martin≈Ø's mind was in developing a whole orchestral score while taking a walk.Rybka, FJ pp. 134‚Äì35. Martin≈Ø's notable students include Burt Bacharach, Alan Hovhaness, V√≠tƒõzslava Kapr√°lov√°, Louis Lane, Jan Nov√°k, H. Owen Reed, Howard Shanet and Chou Wen-chung. = 1953‚Äì59: Europe = In 1953, Martin≈Ø left the United States for France and settled in Nice, and completed his Fantaisies symphoniques; the following year he composed Mirandolina and piano sonata, and met Nikos Kazantzakis, beginning work on The Greek Passion. During 1955 he created several key works: the oratorio Gilgames (The Epic of Gilgamesh), the Oboe Concerto, Les Fresques de Piero della Francesca, and the cantata Otvirani studanek (The Opening of the Wells); Charles Munch conducted the Fantaisies symphoniques premiere in Boston which gained the composer the annual New York critics' prize for the work.Bohuslav Martin≈Ø 1890-1959 : Life and Work. Divadelni Ustav, Praha, 1990, p7-8. In 1956, he took up an appointment as composer-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome and composed Incantation (his fourth piano concerto) and much of The Greek Passion, which he completed in January the following year. Jan Smaczny commented that in the compositions of Martin≈Ø's last years \\"we find the composer attempting through his music a vicarious homecoming\\",Smaczny, Jan. The Mystery which unites. In: Welsh National Opera, The Greek Passion - programme book. 1984, p33. although he never returned to Czechoslovakia. His prolific output continued in 1958 with The Parables for orchestra and the opera Ariane. The following year he attended the first production of Julietta since the premiere in Prague, in Wiesbaden. Further composition continued up to his death: the second version of The Greek Passion, the Nonet, the Madrigaly, and the cantatas Mike≈° z hor (Mike≈° from the Mountains) and The Prophecy of Isaiah. He died in Liestal, Switzerland, on 28 August 1959. His remains were moved and buried in Poliƒçka, Czechoslovakia, in 1979.  Music  :For a comprehensive list, see List of compositions by Bohuslav Martin≈Ø Martin≈Ø was a prolific composer who wrote almost 400 pieces. Many of his works are regularly performed or recorded, among them his oratorio The Epic of Gilgamesh (1955, Epos o Gilgame≈°ovi), his six symphonies, concertos (these number almost thirty ‚Äì four violin concertos, eight compositions for solo piano, four cello concertos, one of each for harpsichord, viola, and oboe, five double concertos, two triple concertos, and two concertos for four solo instruments and orchestra), an anti-war opera Comedy on the Bridge (Veselohra na mostƒõ), chamber music (including eight string quartetsMartin≈Ø is usually credited with seven string quartets, but his String Quartet in E-flat major of 1917 (Halbreich no. 103) was premi√®red in 1994. There is also believed to have been a string quartet from 1912, given the number H. 60 but which is missing, and likewise two other missing quartet works from 1912 (H. 63 and 64); the composer's first known work, Three Horsemen (T≈ôi jezdci, H. 1, ca. 1902), is also for string quartet (Simon, pp. 35‚Äì6.)), three piano quintets,from 1911 (premiered 2012) (H.35), 1933 (premiered 1934) (H.229) and 1944 (premiered 1945) (H.298). See Simon, pp. 36‚Äì38. a piano quartet,and one other quartet with piano, one with oboe, violin and cello from 1947 a flute sonata, a clarinet sonatina and many others.Simon, p.39 Bohuslav Martin≈Ø in New York, around 1942, at the piano working on his second symphony A characteristic feature of his orchestral writing is the near-omnipresent piano; many of his orchestral works include a prominent part for piano, including his small Concerto for harpsichord and chamber orchestra. The bulk of his writing from the 1930s into the 1950s was in a neoclassical vein, but with his last works he opened up his style to include more rhapsodic gestures and a looser, more spontaneous sense of form. This is easiest to hear by comparing his Fantaisies symphoniques (Symphony No. 6), H 343, with its five predecessors, all from the 1940s. One of Martin≈Ø's lesser known works features the theremin. Martin≈Ø started working on his Fantasia for theremin, oboe, string quartet and piano in the summer of 1944, and finished it on October 1. He dedicated it to Lucie Bigelow Rosen, who had commissioned it and was the theremin soloist at its premiere at New York's Town Hall on 3 November 1945, joined by the Koutzen Quartet, Robert Bloom (oboe), and Carlos Salzedo (piano).Simon, p.38 His opera The Greek Passion is based on the novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis, and his orchestral work Memorial to Lidice (Pam√°tn√≠k Lidic√≠m) was written in remembrance of the village of Lidice that was destroyed by the Nazis in reprisal for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in the late spring of 1942. It was completed in August 1943 whilst he was in New York, and premiered there in October of that year.Simon, pp.22, 197‚Äì98, and sources summarised especially D√∂ge, Klaus. \\"Das entsetzliche Grauen zum Ausdruck gebracht: Anmerkungen zu Martin≈Øs Memorial to Lidice, in Bohuslav Martin≈Ø (ed. by Ulrich Tadday), Munich: Text und Kritik, 2009. . .  Personality  There has been many discussions about Martin≈Ø's personality, manners and possible Asperger syndrome. Frank James Rybka has promoted the idea that Martin≈Ø suffered from this kind of autism spectrum disorder. He met Martin≈Ø in 1941, when the composer was 51 and Rybka was only six years old; later on he met him in 1951 and then in 1959, a month before the composer died. According to Rybka, Martin≈Ø was quiet, introverted, and emotionally stolid when meeting persons he did not know well. He typically answered questions very slowly, even when conversing in his native Czech. He might fail to reciprocate socially when people would compliment his music, or do favors for him.Rybka and Osonoff, p. 42. Close friends found him to be a kind, gentle, self-effacing, unbiased person. In 2009, Rybka launched a retrospective study of the composer's unusual personality, based upon interviews of people who knew him, as well as a study of letters he had written to his family and friends. Evidence of his having an autism spectrum disorder was compiled and evaluated, using the established criteria found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disease (DSM-IV). This evidence was reviewed by a well-known autism neuroscientist who concurred that the composer had good evidence of having had an autistic spectrum disorder, most likely Asperger syndrome. This was described in their publication.Martinu's Impressive Quiet, Czech Music, 23 (2009), 31‚Äì50 In 2011, Rybka published a Martin≈Ø biography, in which such traits are reviewed, such as his failure of social reciprocity, his flat affect and stolidity, his phobias and extreme stage fright, his strict adherence to a ritualized schedule, and his zoning out into an aura, while walking with his mind deeply engrossed in composing.Rybka, FJ pp. 293‚Äì307. The biography concludes that there were both positive and negative ways Asperger's affected his life. It seems to have facilitated his extraordinary memory for music, and his ability to compose prolifically and skillfully, but it also left him unable to promote or showcase his music in public.Rybka, FJ pp 315‚Äì23. Against this, Eric Entwistle in his review of Rybka's publication emphasized three main points contradicting Rybka's conclusions. These are: firstly, that it is impossible to diagnose someone so many years after his death; secondly, that Asperger syndrome officially does not exist as a separate syndrome; and finally, that according to Entwistle, Rybka became obsessed with the idea of Martin≈Ø's disorder, finding evidence for his claim everywhere.

It involves dissolving aluminium oxide (alumina) (obtained most often from bauxite, aluminium's chief ore, through the Bayer process) in molten cryolite, and electrolysing the molten salt bath, typically in a purpose-built cell. The Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process applied at industrial scale happens at 940‚Äì980 ¬∞C and produces 99.5‚Äì99.8% pure aluminium. Recycled aluminum requires no electrolysis, thus it does not end up in this process. This process contributes to climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide in the electrolytic reaction.{ Process =Challenge= Elemental aluminium cannot be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt, because hydronium ions readily oxidize elemental aluminium. Although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead, aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 ¬∞C so electrolysing it is impractical. In the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process, alumina, Al2O3, is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite, Na3AlF6, to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis. The carbon source is generally a coke (fossil fuel).{ =Theory= A Hall‚ÄìH√©roult industrial cell In the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes: Cathode: Anode: Overall: In reality, much more CO2 is formed at the anode than CO: Pure cryolite has a melting point of . With a small percentage of alumina dissolved in it, its melting point drops to about 1000 ¬∞C. Besides having a relatively low melting point, cryolite is used as an electrolyte because, among other things, it also dissolves alumina well, conducts electricity, dissociates electrolytically at higher voltage than alumina, and also has a lower density than aluminum at the temperatures required by the electrolysis. Aluminium fluoride (AlF3) is usually added to the electrolyte. The ratio NaF/AlF3 is called the cryolite ratio and it is 3 in pure cryolite. In industrial production, AlF3 is added so that the cryolite ratio is 2‚Äì3 to further reduce the melting point, so that the electrolysis can happen at temperatures between 940 and 980 ¬∞C. The density of liquid aluminum is 2.3 g/ml at temperatures between 950 and 1000 ¬∞C. The density of the electrolyte should be less than 2.1 g/ml, so that the molten aluminum separates from the electrolyte and settles properly to the bottom of the electrolysis cell. In addition to AlF3, other additives like lithium fluoride may be added to alter different properties (melting point, density, conductivity etc.) of the electrolyte. The mixture is electrolysed by passing a low voltage (under 5 V) direct current at through it. This causes liquid aluminium metal to be deposited at the cathode, while the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon from the anode to produce mostly carbon dioxide. The theoretical minimum energy requirement for this process is 6.23 kWh/(kg of Al), but the process commonly requires 15.37 kWh. =Cell operation= Cells in factories are operated 24 hours a day so that the molten material in them will not solidify. Temperature within the cell is maintained via electrical resistance. Oxidation of the carbon anode increases the electrical efficiency at a cost of consuming the carbon electrodes and producing carbon dioxide. While solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature, liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around . The aluminium sinks to the bottom of the electrolytic cell, where it is periodically collected. The liquid aluminium is removed from the cell via a siphon every 1 to 3 days in order to avoid having to use extremely high temperature valves and pumps. Alumina is added to the cells as the aluminum is removed. Collected aluminium from different cells in a factory is finally melted together to ensure uniform product and made into e.g. metal sheets. The electrolytic mixture is sprinkled with coke to prevent the anode's oxidation by the oxygen evolved. The cell produces gases at the anode. The exhaust is primarily CO2 produced from the anode consumption and hydrogen fluoride (HF) from the cryolite and flux (AlF3). In modern facilities, fluorides are almost completely recycled to the cells and therefore used again in the electrolysis. Escaped HF can be neutralized to its sodium salt, sodium fluoride. Particulates are captured using electrostatic or bag filters. The CO2 is usually vented into the atmosphere. Agitation of the molten material in the cell increases its production rate at the expense of an increase in cryolite impurities in the product. Properly designed cells can leverage magnetohydrodynamic forces induced by the electrolysing current to agitate the electrolyte. In non-agitating static pool cells, the impurities either rise to the top of the metallic aluminium, or sink to the bottom, leaving high-purity aluminium in the middle area. =Electrodes= Electrodes in cells are mostly coke which has been purified at high temperatures. Pitch resin or tar is used as a binder. The materials most often used in anodes, coke and pitch resin, are mainly residues from the petroleum industry and need to be of high enough purity so no impurities end up into the molten aluminum or the electrolyte. There are two primary anode technologies using the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process: S√∂derberg technology and prebaked technology. In cells using S√∂derberg or self-baking anodes, there is a single anode per electrolysis cell. The anode is contained within a frame and, as the bottom of the anode turns mainly into CO2 during the electrolysis, the anode loses mass and, being amorphous, it slowly sinks within its frame. More material to the top of the anode is continuously added in the form of briquettes made from coke and pitch. The lost heat from the smelting operation is used to bake the briquettes into the carbon form required for the reaction with alumina. The baking process in S√∂derberg anodes during electrolysis releases more carcinogenic PAHs and other pollutants than electrolysis with prebaked anodes and, partially for this reason, prebaked anode-using cells have become more common in the aluminium industry. More alumina is added to the electrolyte from the sides of the S√∂derberg anode after the crust on top of the electrolyte mixture is broken. Prebaked anodes are baked in very large gas-fired ovens at high temperature before being lowered by various heavy industrial lifting systems into the electrolytic solution. There are usually 24 prebaked anodes in two rows per cell. Each anode is lowered vertically and individually by a computer, as the bottom surfaces of the anodes are eaten away during the electrolysis. Compared to S√∂derberg anodes, computer-controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis. This smaller distance decreases the resistance caused by the electrolyte mixture and increases the efficiency of prebaked anodes over S√∂derberg anodes. Prebake technology also has much lower risk of the anode effect (see below), but cells using it are more expensive to build and labor-intensive to use, as each prebaked anode in a cell needs to be removed and replaced once it has been used. Alumina is added to the electrolyte from between the anodes in prebake cells. Prebaked anodes contain a smaller percentage of pitch, as they need to be more solid than S√∂derberg anodes. The remains of prebaked anodes are used to make more new prebaked anodes. Prebaked anodes are either made in the same factory where electrolysis happens, or are brought there from elsewhere. The inside of the cell's bath is lined with cathode made from coke and pitch. Cathodes also degrade during electrolysis, but much more slowly than anodes do, and thus they need neither be as high in purity, nor be maintained as often. Cathodes are typically replaced every 2‚Äì6 years. This requires the whole cell to be shut down. =Anode effect= The anode effect is a situation where too many gas bubbles form at the bottom of the anode and join together, forming a layer. This increases the resistance of the cell, because smaller areas of the electrolyte touch the anode. These areas of the electrolyte and anode heat up when the density of the electric current of the cell focuses to go through only them. This heats up the gas layer and causes it to expand, thus further reducing the surface area where electrolyte and anode are in contact with each other. The anode effect decreases the energy-efficiency and the aluminium production of the cell. It also induces the formation of tetrafluoromethane (CF4) in significant quantities, increases formation of CO and, to a lesser extent, also causes the formation of hexafluoroethane (C2F6). CF4 and C2F6 are not CFCs, and, although not detrimental to the ozone layer, are still potent greenhouse gases. The anode effect is mainly a problem in S√∂derberg technology cells, not in prebaked. History =Existing need= Aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust, but it is rarely found in its elemental state. It occurs in many minerals, but its primary commercial source is bauxite, a mixture of hydrated aluminium oxides and compounds of other elements such as iron. Prior to the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process, elemental aluminium was made by heating ore along with elemental sodium or potassium in a vacuum. The method was complicated and consumed materials that were in themselves expensive at that time. This meant that the cost to produce the small amount of aluminium made in the early 19th century was very high, higher than for gold or platinum. Bars of aluminium were exhibited alongside the French crown jewels at the Exposition Universelle of 1855, and Emperor Napoleon III of France was said to have reserved his few sets of aluminium dinner plates and eating utensils for his most honored guests. Production costs using older methods did come down, but when aluminium was selected as the material for the cap/lightning rod to sit atop the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., it was still more expensive than silver. =Independent discovery= The Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process was invented independently and almost simultaneously in 1886 by the American chemist Charles Martin Hall and by the Frenchman Paul H√©roultH√©roult, Paul; French patent no. 175,711 (filed: 23 April 1886; issued: 1 September 1886).‚Äîboth 22 years old. Some authors claim Hall was assisted by his sister Julia Brainerd Hall; however, the extent to which she was involved has been disputed. In 1888, Hall opened the first large-scale aluminium production plant in Pittsburgh. It later became the Alcoa corporation. In 1997, the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in recognition of the importance of the process in the commercialization of aluminium. =Economic impact= Aluminum produced via the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process, in combination with cheaper electric power, helped make aluminium (and incidentally magnesium) an inexpensive commodity rather than a precious metal. This, in turn, helped make it possible for pioneers like Hugo Junkers to utilize aluminium and aluminium-magnesium alloys to make items like metal airplanes by the thousands, or Howard Lund to make aluminium fishing boats.Lund Boat Company Founder Dies at 91 In 2012 it was estimated that 12.7 tons of CO2 emissions are generated per ton of aluminium produced.

Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils to move an armature bar up and down. Connected to the armature bar is a barred needle grouping that pushes ink into the skin. Tattoo artists generally use the term \\"machine\\", pen, or even \\"iron\\", to refer to their equipment. The word \\"gun\\" is occasionally used but is widely considered derogatory or even offensive by some professional artists. In addition to \\"coiled\\" tattoo machines, there are also rotary tattoo machines, which are powered by regulated motors rather than electromagnetic coils. \\"The basic machine is pretty much unchanged today, in recent years variations of the theme have crept into the market, namely Manfred Kohr‚Äôs Rotary machine of 1976 or Carson Hill‚Äôs pneumatic machine that uses compressed air rather than electricity, but the principle is essentially the same.\\"Jamie Dwelly in History of tattoos, 2015 AETN UK History , Stencil-Pens The predecessor to the tattoo machine was the electric pen invented by Thomas Alva Edison and patented under the title Stencil-Pens in Newark, New Jersey, United States in 1876. It was originally intended to be used as a duplicating device, but in 1891, Samuel O'Reilly discovered that Edison's machine could be modified and used to introduce ink into the skin, and later patented a tube and needle system to provide an ink reservoir. While O'Reilly's machine was based on the tattoo rotary technology of Edison's device, modern tattoo machines use electromagnets. The first machine based on this technology was a single coil machine patented by Thomas Riley of London, just twenty days after O'Reilly filed the patent for his rotary machine. For his machine, Riley placed a modified doorbell assembly in a brass box. The modern two-coil configuration was patented by Alfred Charles South, also of London. Because it was so heavy, a spring was often attached to the top of the machine and the ceiling to take most of the weight off the operator's hand. Most modern tattoo machines can control needle depth, speed, and force of application, which has allowed tattooing to become a very precise art form. Such advances in precision have also produced a style of facial tattooing that has attained mainstream popularity in America called dermapigmentation, or \\"permanent cosmetics\\" creating results such as addition/removal of freckles, beauty spots and scars. Classification Tattoo equipment, Fred Harris Studio, Sydney, Australia, by Ray Olsen, 1937There are many types of machines. Liners and shaders are the more common machines from a technical standpoint. Mechanically, there are coil tattoo machines; also pneumatic machines, and rotary, or linear, tattoo machines. * Manfred Kohrs 1978 - Rotary tattoo machineRotary tattoo machine: An excenter-rotary tattoo machine, built in 1978 by Manfred Kohrs of Germany.Stadtkind Hannovermagazin, Ausgabe Juli 2016, S. 44-49: Nadelstiche. Im Interview:Manfred Kohrs.Tattoo Nation - Tattoo Magazine, Issue # 1, July 10 2014, Page 35. Rotary tattoo machines were the original machines, based on rotary technology, which was invented by Samuel O'Reilly and improved by the tattoo artists through the years. Rotary type machines use an electric motor to drive the needles. Some recent upgrades include using an armature bar to increase efficiency, a characteristic of coil machines.John Reardon: The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting a Tattoo. Penguin 2008, , p. 70. Recently, there have been improvements to make this type of machine pneumatic, in place of the electric motor used now. * Two-coil tattoo machineCoil tattoo machine: Coil tattoo machines are the most commonly seen and used. These machines use an electromagnetic circuit to move the needle grouping. There are many variations, from single-coiled machines to triple-coiled machines. They can be made from many different materials and in many different sizes and shapes. Dual-coiled machines are considered to be standard. The coils generally range from 8 to 10 wrap. The coils create the impedance, or resistance, used to properly regulate the machine's speed and power. This causes less trauma to the skin.C. R. Jordan: Basic Fundamentals of Modern Tattoo: Tattoo Apprentice Basics. Tattoo Books Online LLC 2009, . * Liner tattoo machine: The purpose of a liner machine is to lay the ink in the skin in one single pass to create a dominant line. It uses a short contact circuit (about 1.5mm‚Äì2mm), which causes the machine to cycle faster. * Shader tattoo machine: The shader machine is commonly used to shade black or variants of black ink, though colors other than black are also used in this type of machine. The saturation level of this machine is low. It uses a bigger contact gap than a liner (about 2mm‚Äì3.5mm) to make it cycle slightly slower. This machine is also used for sculpting lines. Some artists will use this type of machine for all lines, as it allows the lines to be retraced with less trauma to the skin. * Pneumatic tattoo machine: Tattoo artist Carson Hill in the year 2000 invented the first pneumatic tattoo machine and began the patent process. A pneumatic tattoo machine is powered by an air compressor and is extremely lightweight. Pneumatic tattoo machines use pressurized air to drive the needles up and down.Margo DeMello: Inked: Tattoos and Body Art around the World. ABC-CLIO 2014, , p. 370. These tattoo machines are easily sterilised as the entire machine can be placed in an autoclave without any major disassembly (unlike traditional coil machines which require complete disassembly before being placed in an autoclave). Tattoo machines are not limited to just these types. A common variant is having a \\"cutback\\", which uses stiffer front springs. This is more commonly used in liners, but is known to be used on shader machines, more typically for portrait work. Machines are usually categorized into long stroke and short stroke varieties. The longer- stroked machines are good for coloring and shading, as well as sculpting lines, while doing less damage to clients' skin. Shorter-stroke machines are commonly used for lining in a single pass style, and also in a shader setup to achieve a more subtle gradation of black such as would be found in portraits. Length, width, tension, angle, and stiffness of the spring varies the functionality of the machine. The contact gaps, as well as capacitors and even the style of machine and its angles of deflection, can also all be variants in machine tuning. The proper tuning of the machine is essential for the type of machine being used, also for the type of tattoo the artist is doing.

In his works, he sought to synthesize the thought of St. Augustine and Descartes, in order to demonstrate the active role of God in every aspect of the world. Malebranche is best known for his doctrines of vision in God, occasionalism and ontologism. Biography =Early years= Malebranche was born in Paris in 1638, the youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche, secretary to King Louis XIII of France, and Catherine de Lauzon, sister of Jean de Lauson, a Governor of New France. Because of a malformed spine, Malebranche received his elementary education from a private tutor. He left home at the age of sixteen to pursue a course of philosophy at the Coll√®ge de la Marche, and subsequently to study theology at the Coll√®ge de Sorbonne, both colleges from the University of Paris. He eventually left the Sorbonne, having rejected scholasticism, and entered the Oratory in 1660. There, he devoted himself to ecclesiastical history, linguistics, the Bible, and the works of Saint Augustine. Malebranche was ordained a priest in 1664. In 1664, Malebranche first read Descartes' Treatise on Man, an account of the physiology of the human body. Malebranche‚Äôs biographer, Father Yves Andr√© reported that Malebranche was influenced by Descartes‚Äô book because it allowed him to view the natural world without Aristotelian scholasticism. Malebranche spent the next decade studying the Cartesian system. =Philosophical career= In 1674‚Äì75, Malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work. Entitled Concerning the Search after Truth. In which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences (), the book laid the foundation for Malebranche‚Äôs philosophical reputation and ideas. It dealt with the causes of human error and on how to avoid such mistakes. Most importantly, in the third book, which discussed pure understanding, he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in God. Malebranche's first critic was the Abb√© Simon Foucher, who attacked the Search even before its second volume had been published. Malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume, and then, in the 1678 third edition, he added 50% to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of (eventually) seventeen Elucidations. These responded to further criticisms, but they also expanded on the original arguments, and developed them in new ways. In the Tenth Elucidation, for instance, Malebranche introduced his theory of \\"intelligible extension\\", a single, archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved. In others, Malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation, and particularly on his contention that God acted for the most part through \\"general volitions\\" and only rarely, as in the case of miracles, through \\"particular volitions\\". Malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published Treatise on Nature and Grace. Here, he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby God regulated His behaviour extended not only to His activity in the natural world but also applied to His gift of grace to human beings. The book was attacked by fellow Cartesian philosopher Antoine Arnauld, and, although Arnauld's initial concerns were theological ones, the bitter dispute which ensued very quickly branched out into most other areas of their respective systems. Over the next few years, the two men wrote enough polemics against one another to fill four volumes of Malebranche's collected works and three of Arnauld's. Arnauld's supporters managed to persuade the Roman Catholic Church to place Nature and Grace on its Index of Prohibited Books in 1690, and it was followed there by the Search nineteen years later. (Ironically, the Index already contained several works by the Jansenist Arnauld himself.) Other critics with whom Malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow Cartesian, Pierre Sylvain Regis, as well as Dortous de Mairan. De Mairan was sympathetic to the views of Baruch Spinoza, and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of Malebranche: Malebranche assiduously resisted such an association. =Timeline= * 1638 - Born in Paris to Nicolas Malebranche and Catherine de Lauzon. * 1654 - Enters the Coll√®ge de la Marche and later the Sorbonne to study philosophy and theology. * 1660 - Ordained as a member of the French Oratory. * 1664 - First reads Descartes' Treatise on Man and spends the next ten years studying philosophy. * 1674‚Äì75 - Publishes The Search After Truth. * 1678 - Adds Elucidations to new edition of the Search. * 1680 - Publishes Treatise Of Nature And Grace. * 1683 - Publishes Christian and Metaphysical Meditations.

Philosophy =Vision in God= Just as all human action (along with the action of any other creature) is entirely dependent on God, so too is all human cognition. Malebranche argued that human knowledge is dependent on divine understanding in a way analogous to that in which the motion of bodies is dependent on divine will. Like Ren√© Descartes, Malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas ‚Äì immaterial representations present to the mind. But whereas Descartes believed ideas are mental entities, Malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in God. These ideas, therefore, are uncreated and independent of finite minds. When we access them intellectually, we apprehend objective truth. Malebranche defined \\"truth\\" as a relation between ideas: since these ideas are in God, they are eternal and immutable, and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable. Malebranche divided these relations between ideas into two categories: relations of magnitude and relations of quality or perfection. The former constitute \\"speculative\\" truths, such as those of geometry, while the latter constitute the \\"practical\\" truths of ethics. Ethical principles, for Malebranche, are therefore divine in their foundation, universal in their application, and to be discovered by intellectual contemplation, just as geometrical principles are. With regard to this account of intellectual knowledge, Malebranche was more or less following Saint Augustine. His great innovation was to explain how these same divine ideas could also serve as the immediate objects of human minds in sensual perception. The problem there is that the divine ideas are universal, whereas all perception seems to be of particulars. Malebranche's solution was to suggest that, whereas the mind's intellectual conception of these ideas is pure and direct, its sensual perception of them will be modified by \\"sensations\\". These sensations, unlike the ideas, are indeed proper to individual created minds, and subsist as modes thereof. The idea will represent only the geometrical or mechanical properties of bodies (size, shape, motion), while the sensation will consist in colour or some other sensible quality. The latter will limit the mind's apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind. To a different mind, one with a different sensation, the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind. In the Dialogues On Metaphysics And Religion (dialogue 1), Malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for (the mental as opposed to the physiological element in) imagination, in this case where the idea only \\"lightly touches\\" the mind. Malebranche was strongly influenced by Descartes but did not accept his philosophy uncritically. He is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in God and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and 'occasionalism' to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body. However, his attribution of epistemological and explanatory primacy to God leads to difficulties. (1) If we see all things in God in the sense that He puts the ideas into our minds we can have no direct knowledge of the external world. We can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things, but it is God who is ultimately responsible for our ideas. (2) If all things are under the direct control of God, subject to His will, what of human freedom? Malebranche's view that we have freedom to choose but only in relation to finite goods is not convincing, denying as it does the possibility of resistance of movement towards God as the universal good. (This may be a misrepresentation of Malebranche's view; see the first chapter of The Search for Truth, where he specifies that while we cannot but desire the good in general, we are free to apply that love to particulars, and can do so in a disordered fashion that leads to sin. His account is no different from St. Augustine's in this regard.) (3) In so far as God is not to be identified with the archetypal eternal truths in his mind, Malebranche is not a pantheist. But, as in mediaeval philosophy, this gives rise to the problem of reconciling God's freedom with His supposed immutability. =Theodicy= Malebranche's theodicy is his solution to the problem of evil. Although he conceded that God had the power to create a more perfect world, free from all defects, such a world would have necessitated a greater complexity in divine ways. Thus, God produces the natural evils that follow from simple laws not because he wills those particular effects, but because he wills a world that best reflects his wisdom by achieving the best possible balance between the intrinsic perfection of the work and the simplicity and generality of its laws. =Malebranche's dualism= Whereas Malebranche followed Augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge, in his approach to mind‚Äìbody problems he began as a follower of Descartes. But in contrast to Descartes, who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind, Malebranche argues in the Dialogues on Metaphysics, a dialogue between Theodore and Aristes, that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind, and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind. > I am unable, when I turn to myself, to recognize any of my faculties or my > capacities. The inner sensation which I have of myself informs me that I am, > that I think, that I will, that I have sensory awareness, that I suffer, and > so on; but it provides me with no knowledge whatever of what I am ‚Äì of the > nature of my thought, my sensations, my passions, or my pain ‚Äì or of the > mutual relations that obtain between all these things. ...I have no idea > whatever of my soul. This leads Theodore to declare that 'I am not my own light to myself'; the nature of our own minds is highly obscure. What is more, with regard to psycho-physical interaction, Malebranche argues that body could not act on mind, nor mind on body. The only active power (hence the only efficient cause of change in the world) is God. When I will that my arm should rise, my volition is the \\"occasion\\" or the \\"occasional cause\\" of the movement of my arm; the efficient cause of both my volition and the movement of my arm is God. Malebranche's doctrine, which could be found in contemporary commentaries on Aristotle, and which first appeared in certain Arab philosophers, is therefore called \\"occasionalism\\". =Occasionalism= In general, occasionalism is the view that there are no efficient causes in the full sense other than God. Created things are at best \\"occasions\\" for divine activity. Bodies and minds act neither on themselves nor on each other; God alone brings about all the phenomena of nature and the mind. Changes occurring in created things will exhibit regularities (and will thus satisfy a Humean definition of causation) because God in creating the world observes what Malebranche calls \\"order\\": he binds himself to act according to laws of nature chosen in accordance with his general will that the world be as good as possible, and thus (for example) that the laws be simple and few in number. In particular, there will be laws governing what we would customarily call the \\"interaction\\" of body and mind, so that similar movements in the body will \\"occasion\\" similar ideas in the mind. That relation has some features of the causal relation (it satisfies, for example, universal conditionals of the form \\"Whenever C occurs, E occurs\\"). But in reality both the idea in the mind and the movement in the body are caused by God. Scientific contributions Although better known for his philosophical work, Malebranche made some notable contributions to physics, working within a broadly Cartesian framework but nevertheless prepared to depart from Descartes where necessary. In 1699, he delivered an address to the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences on the nature of light and color, wherein he argued that different colors resulted out of different frequencies in the pressure vibrations of subtle matter, much as different musical tones derived from different frequencies in the vibrations of air. His theory was presented as a corrective to Descartes' view, rather than a refutation thereof, but it has important parallels with the rival optical theory of Isaac Newton. Newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier, but Malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the Opticks of 1704, or, more likely, in its Latin translation of 1706. When Malebranche revised his 1699 paper for inclusion as the Sixteenth Elucidation of the 1712 edition of The Search After Truth, he inserted a number of references to \\"Newton's excellent work\\". In addition, Malebranche wrote on the laws of motion, a topic he discussed extensively with Leibniz. He also wrote on mathematics and, although he made no major mathematical discoveries of his own, he was instrumental in introducing and disseminating the contributions of Descartes and Leibniz in France. Malebranche introduced l'H√¥pital to Johann Bernoulli, with the ultimate result being the publication of the first textbook in infinitesimal calculus. Malebranche also developed an original theory related to preformationism, postulating that each embryo probably contained even smaller embryos ad infinitum, like an idealized Matryoshka doll. According to Malebranche, \\"an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg, but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence\\" (Magner 158‚Äì9). Magner, Lois. A History of the Life Sciences. New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc, 2002 Legacy Aside, perhaps, from John Norris (who, in any case, drew at least as much from Malebranche's own sources, primarily Saint Augustine, as he did from Malebranche himself), there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of Malebranche in all matters. He was, however, held in widespread high regard within his own lifetime and for some time afterwards, and the influence of certain of his ideas can be discerned in the works of several important figures. Pierre Bayle regarded Malebranche as \\"one of the greatest philosophers of this age\\" (though, admittedly, not as the greatest, as is often reported).See Bayle's Historical and Critical Dictionary, article on \\"Epicurus\\", note S. In note H to his \\"Zeno of Elea\\" article, Bayle discussed Malebranche's views on material substance with particular approval. Occasionalism and the vision in God seem to make the real existence of material substance redundant. Not only is it unable to be directly perceived, but it cannot actually affect us or anything else in any way at all. Descartes had also maintained that matter was not directly perceivable, but he had argued that the veracity of God could support a proof of its certain existence. Malebranche, however, weakened Descartes' argument, concluding that, from a philosophical point of view, its existence could only be shown to be probable. Bayle pushed even further down this same path, thereby laying much of the ground work for the immaterialism of George Berkeley. Berkeley, influenced both by Bayle and directly by Malebranche himself, simply took the final step to a full denial of the existence of material substance. (Arthur Collier, who was also influenced directly by Malebranche, and by Norris, made the same move at around the same time as Berkeley did, but, it would appear, entirely independently of him.) Berkeley, admittedly, did reject the theory of vision in God. \\"It is evident\\", he insisted, \\"that the things I perceive are my own ideas.\\"Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, second dialogue. But he was influenced by Malebranche's occasionalism, even though he excluded the activity of created minds from its domain. In addition, Berkeley agreed with Malebranche, against Descartes, that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself. John Locke had also argued for this, but he had made no distinction between minds and bodies on this point, whereas both Berkeley and Malebranche maintained (each in his own way) that we could have ideas of bodies but not of minds. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (who met Malebranche in Paris in about 1675 and corresponded with him thereafter) also rejected the vision in God, and his theory of pre-established harmony was designed as a new alternative to occasionalism as well as to the more traditional theory of efficient causal interaction. However, in his own theodicy, even if it was somewhat more elaborate than Malebranche's, he did at least agree with Malebranche's fundamental contention that the simplicity of God's ways had to be given as much regard as the world's perfection. David Hume supported and drew upon Malebranche's negative arguments to show that no genuine causal connections could be conceived between distinct mundane entities. However, when it came to finding a positive replacement for such causal connections, he turned inwards to the workings of the human mind, instead of turning upwards to God. With regard to this second half of Malebranche's occasionalism, Hume wrote: :We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory. ...Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses.An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, section 7, part 1. Hume's empiricist epistemology led him to distrust Malebranche's confidence in discovering abstruse metaphysical truths through an intellectual union with God. Likewise, Locke felt that Malebranche's metaphysical speculations lacked a proper foundation, and, though ingenious, were ultimately unintelligible. In a somewhat similar manner, Arthur Schopenhauer regarded the theory of vision in God as \\"explaining something unknown by something even more unknown.\\"Parerga and Paralipomena, Vol. I, \\"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real\\" Locke withheld his \\"An Examination of P[√®re] Malebranche's Opinion Of Seeing All Things In God\\" from publication, \\"because he looked upon it to be an opinion that would not spread but was like to die of itself, or at least to do no great harm.\\" \\"Advertisement To The Reader\\" of Locke's Posthumous Works. Much as Locke predicted, Malebranche's reputation outside France (where he always enjoyed high esteem) did begin to diminish during the 18th century, and remained low thereafter. However, over the last three or four decades, Malebranche's work has drawn renewed and ever-increasing interest. Several of his works have been translated into English for the first time, as scholars have been reassessing his ideas. Many have begun to argue that the originality and unity of his philosophical system merits him a place alongside such figures as Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz.

Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, time value of money and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors. Oftentimes, it is even more difficult to determine the BATNA of the other party. However, the information is crucial as the BATNA determines the other side's negotiation power. Sometimes, conclusions can be drawn by determining his/her main interests and the negotiation itself can be used to verify or falsify the assumptions. If, for example, it is assumed that a very early delivery date is of key importance to the negotiating partner, deliberately setting a later delivery date can be proposed. If this late delivery date is decidedly rejected, the desired delivery date is likely to be of great importance.Jung/Krebs, p. 42.  BATNA based tactics  Because of the importance of the BATNA for the negotiation success, several tactics focus on weakening the opponent's BATNA. This may be achieved e.g. by striving for exclusive negotiations, delaying or accelerating the ongoing negotiations or limiting the negotiation partner to technical systems. If a negotiator is faced with such tactics it is his/her task to examine the possible consequences for the own BATNA and to prevent or counteract any deterioration of the own party's BATNA.Jung/Krebs, p. 143.  BATNA and the order of negotiations  The BATNA can also influence the order in which negotiations are taken up with potential contracting partners. Favourable is a sequential approach. Here one starts negotiations with the less favoured partners and proceed negotiations with the preferred option afterwards. In this way there is the BATNA of a contract with the less favoured partner.Jung/Krebs, p. 44. Overview The BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value,Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement however, without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria.Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement  YArooms Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options. This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating. Negotiators also need to be aware of the other negotiator's BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.Negotiation, Readings, Exercises and Cases, Roy J. Lewicki Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques. This is known as a hard negotiation style; a theoretical example of this is adversarial approach style negotiation. Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding. According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long-term relationship between the parties. Attractive alternatives are needed to develop a strong BATNA. In the best-selling book Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In, the authors give three suggestions of how to accomplish this: # Creating a list of actions one might take if no agreement is reached # Converting some of the more promising ideas and transforming them into tangible and partial alternatives # Selecting the alternative that sounds best In negotiations involving different cultures, all parties need to account for cultural cognitive behaviors and should not let judgments and biases affect the negotiation. The individual should be separate from the objective. The purpose here, as Philip Gulliver mentions, is for negotiation parties to be aware. Preparation at all levels, including prejudice-free thoughts, emotion-free behavior, bias-free behavior are helpful according to Morris and Gelfand.  History  BATNA was developed by negotiation researchers Roger Fisher and William Ury of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON), in their series of books on principled negotiation that started with Getting to YES, unwittingly duplicating the game theory concept of a disagreement point from bargaining problems pioneered by Nobel Laureate John Forbes Nash decades earlier. A Nash Equilibrium is reached among a group of players when no player can benefit from changing strategies if every other player sticks to their current strategy. For example, Amy and Phil are in Nash Equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can, taking into account Phil's decision, and Phil is making the best decision he can, taking into account Amy's decision. Likewise, a group of players are in Nash Equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others.

A sphere is not a Euclidean space, but locally the laws of the Euclidean geometry are good approximations. In a small triangle on the face of the earth, the sum of the angles is only slightly more than 180 degrees. The surface of a sphere can be represented by a collection of two dimensional maps. Therefore, it is a two dimensional manifold. A sphere with a triangle on it. Spherical geometry is the geometry of the two-dimensional surface of a sphere. It is an example of a geometry that is not Euclidean. Two practical applications of the principles of spherical geometry are navigation and astronomy. Overview In plane (Euclidean) geometry, the basic concepts are points and (straight) lines. On a sphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The equivalents of lines are not defined in the usual sense of \\"straight line\\" in Euclidean geometry, but in the sense of \\"the shortest paths between points\\", which are called geodesics. On a sphere, the geodesics are the great circles; other geometric concepts are defined as in plane geometry, but with straight lines replaced by great circles. Thus, in spherical geometry, angles are defined between great circles, resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects; for example, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle exceeds 180 degrees. Spherical geometry is not elliptic geometry, but is rather a subset of elliptic geometry. For example, it shares with that geometry the property that a line has no parallels through a given point. Contrast this with Euclidean geometry, in which a line has one parallel through a given point, and hyperbolic geometry, in which a line has two parallels and an infinite number of ultraparallels through a given point. An important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points (pairs of opposite points) on the sphere. Locally, the projective plane has all the properties of spherical geometry, but it has different global properties. In particular, it is non-orientable, or one-sided. Concepts of spherical geometry may also be applied to the oblong sphere, though minor modifications must be implemented on certain formulas. Higher-dimensional spherical geometries exist; see elliptic geometry. History = Greek antiquity= The earliest mathematical work of antiquity to come down to our time is On the rotating sphere (Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ œÉœÜŒ±ŒØœÅŒ±œÇ‚Äé, Peri kinoumenes sphairas) by Autolycus of Pitane, who lived at the end of the fourth century BC. Spherical trigonometry was studied by early Greek mathematicians such as Theodosius of Bithynia, a Greek astronomer and mathematician who wrote the Sphaerics, a book on the geometry of the sphere, and Menelaus of Alexandria, who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called Sphaerica and developed Menelaus' theorem. =Islamic world= The Book of Unknown Arcs of a Sphere written by the Islamic mathematician Al-Jayyani is considered to be the first treatise on spherical trigonometry. The book contains formulae for right-handed triangles, the general law of sines, and the solution of a spherical triangle by means of the polar triangle.School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences University of St Andrews The book On Triangles by Regiomontanus, written around 1463, is the first pure trigonometrical work in Europe. However, Gerolamo Cardano noted a century later that much of its material on spherical trigonometry was taken from the twelfth-century work of the Andalusi scholar Jabir ibn Aflah.Victor J.

Properties With points defined as the points on a sphere and lines as the great circles of that sphere, a spherical geometry has the following properties: * Any two lines intersect in two diametrically opposite points, called antipodal points. * Any two points that are not antipodal points determine a unique line. * There is a natural unit of angle measurement (based on a revolution), a natural unit of length (based on the circumference of a great circle) and a natural unit of area (based on the area of the sphere). * Each line is associated with a pair of antipodal points, called the poles of the line, which are the common intersections of the set of lines perpendicular to the given line. * Each point is associated with a unique line, called the polar line of the point, which is the line on the plane through the centre of the sphere and perpendicular to the diameter of the sphere through the given point. As there are two arcs (line segments) determined by a pair of points, which are not antipodal, on the line they determine, three non-collinear points do not determine a unique triangle. However, if we only consider triangles whose sides are minor arcs of great circles, we have the following properties: * The angle sum of a triangle is greater than 180¬∞ and less than 540¬∞. * The area of a triangle is proportional to the excess of its angle sum over 180¬∞. * Two triangles with the same angle sum are equal in area. * There is an upper bound for the area of triangles. * The composition (product) of two (orthogonal) line reflections may be considered as a rotation about either of the points of intersection of their axes. * Two triangles are congruent if and only if they correspond under a finite product of line reflections. * Two triangles with corresponding angles equal are congruent (i.e., all similar triangles are congruent). Relation to Euclid's postulates Spherical geometry obeys two of Euclid's postulates: the second postulate (\\"to produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line\\") and the fourth postulate (\\"that all right angles are equal to one another\\"). However, it violates the other three: contrary to the first postulate, there is not a unique shortest route between any two points (antipodal points such as the north and south poles on a spherical globe are counterexamples); contrary to the third postulate, a sphere does not contain circles of arbitrarily great radius; and contrary to the fifth (parallel) postulate, there is no point through which a line can be drawn that never intersects a given line.Gowers, Timothy, Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2002: pp. 94 and 98. A statement that is equivalent to the parallel postulate is that there exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180¬∞. Since spherical geometry violates the parallel postulate, there exists no such triangle on the surface of a sphere. The sum of the angles of a triangle on a sphere is , where f is the fraction of the sphere's surface that is enclosed by the triangle. For any positive value of f, this exceeds 180¬∞.

In brief, the sample undergoes protein denaturation, followed by gel electrophoresis. A synthetic or animal-derived antibody (known as the primary antibody) is created that recognises and binds to a specific target protein. The electrophoresis membrane is washed in a solution containing the primary antibody, before excess antibody is washed off. A secondary antibody is added which recognises and binds to the primary antibody. The secondary antibody is visualised through various methods such as staining, immunofluorescence, and radioactivity, allowing indirect detection of the specific target protein. Other related techniques include dot blot analysis, quantitative dot blot, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry, where antibodies are used to detect proteins in tissues and cells by immunostaining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The name western blot is a play on the Southern blot, a technique for DNA detection named after its inventor, English biologist Edwin Southern. Similarly, detection of RNA is termed as northern blot. The term \\"western blot\\" was given by W. Neal Burnette in 1981, although the method itself originated in 1979 in the laboratory of Harry Towbin at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel, Switzerland. Between 1979 and 2019 \\"it has been mentioned in the titles, abstracts, and keywords of more than 400,000 PubMed-listed publications\\" and may still be the most used protein-analytical technique. Applications The western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein- modifications (such as post-translational modifications). At least 8-9% of all protein-related publications are estimated to apply western blots. It is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins. A semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and color intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane. In addition, applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration. The western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning. It is also used in medical diagnostics, e.g., in the HIV test or BSE-Test. The confirmatory HIV test employs a western blot to detect anti-HIV antibody in a human serum sample. Proteins from known HIV-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above. Then, the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step; free antibody is washed away, and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added. The stained bands then indicate the proteins to which the patient's serum contains antibody. A western blot is also used as the definitive test for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a type of prion disease linked to the consumption of contaminated beef from cattle with Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly referred to as 'mad cow disease'). Another application is in the diagnosis of tularemia. An evaluation of the western blot's ability to detect antibodies against F. tularensis revealed that its sensitivity is almost 100% and the specificity is 99.6%. Some forms of Lyme disease testing employ western blotting. A western blot can also be used as a confirmatory test for Hepatitis B infection and HSV-2 (Herpes Type 2) infection. In veterinary medicine, a western blot is sometimes used to confirm FIV+ status in cats. Further applications of the western blot technique include its use by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Blood doping is the misuse of certain techniques and/or substances to increase one's red blood cell mass, which allows the body to transport more oxygen to muscles and therefore increase stamina and performance. There are three widely known substances or methods used for blood doping, namely, erythropoietin (EPO), synthetic oxygen carriers and blood transfusions. Each is prohibited under WADA's List of Prohibited Substances and Methods. The western blot technique was used during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in the anti-doping campaign for that event. In total, over 1000 samples were collected and analyzed by Reichel, et al. in the WADA accredited Laboratory of Lausanne, Switzerland. Recent research utilizing the western blot technique showed an improved detection of EPO in blood and urine based on novel Velum SAR precast horizontal gels optimized for routine analysis.https://precisionbiosystems.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/10/Application_Note_Improvements-for-EPO- detection_Schwenke_2015.pdf With the adoption of the horizontal SAR-PAGE in combination with the precast film-supported Velum SAR gels the discriminatory capacity of micro-dose application of rEPO was significantly enhanced. Procedure The western blot method is composed of a gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide, followed by an electrophoretic transfer onto a membrane (mostly PVDF or Nitrocellulose) and an immunostaining procedure to visualize a certain protein on the blot membrane. SDS-PAGE is generally used for the denaturing electrophoretic separation of proteins. SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non- specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies. =Gel electrophoresis= The proteins of the sample are separated using gel electrophoresis. Separation of proteins may be by isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight, electric charge, or a combination of these factors. The nature of the separation depends on the treatment of the sample and the nature of the gel. By far the most common type of gel electrophoresis employs polyacrylamide gels and buffers loaded with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). SDS- PAGE (SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) maintains polypeptides in a denatured state once they have been treated with strong reducing agents to remove secondary and tertiary structure (e.g. disulfide bonds [S-S] to sulfhydryl groups [SH and SH]) and thus allows separation of proteins by their molecular mass. Sampled proteins become covered in the negatively charged SDS, effectively becoming anionic, and migrate towards the positively charged (higher voltage) anode (usually having a red wire) through the acrylamide mesh of the gel. Smaller proteins migrate faster through this mesh, and the proteins are thus separated according to size (usually measured in kilodaltons, kDa). The concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel - the greater the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins. The lower the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins. Proteins travel only in one dimension along the gel for most blots. Samples are loaded into wells in the gel. One lane is usually reserved for a marker or ladder, which is a commercially available mixture of proteins of known molecular weights, typically stained so as to form visible, coloured bands. When voltage is applied along the gel, proteins migrate through it at different speeds dependent on their size. These different rates of advancement (different electrophoretic mobilities) separate into bands within each lane. Protein bands can then be compared to the ladder bands, allowing estimation of the protein's molecular weight. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis It is also possible to use a two-dimensional gel which spreads the proteins from a single sample out in two dimensions. Proteins are separated according to isoelectric point (pH at which they have a neutral net charge) in the first dimension, and according to their molecular weight in the second dimension. =Transfer= To make the proteins accessible to antibody detection, they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose (NC) or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The most commonly used method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting. Electroblotting uses an electric current to pull the negatively charged proteins from the gel towards the positively charged anode, and into the PVDF or NC membrane. The proteins move from within the gel onto the membrane while maintaining the organization they had within the gel. An older method of transfer involves placing a membrane on top of the gel, and a stack of filter papers on top of that. The entire stack is placed in a buffer solution which moves up the paper by capillary action, bringing the proteins with it. In practice this method is not commonly used due to the lengthy procedure time. As a result of either transfer process, the proteins are exposed on a thin membrane layer for detection. Both varieties of membrane are chosen for their non-specific protein binding properties (i.e. binds all proteins equally well). Protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions, as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein. Nitrocellulose membranes are cheaper than PVDF, but are far more fragile and cannot withstand repeated probings. Western blot transfer =Total protein staining= Total protein staining allows the total protein that has been successfully transferred to the membrane to be visualised, allowing the user to check the uniformity of protein transfer and to perform subsequent normalization of the target protein with the actual protein amount per lane. Normalization with the so-called \\"loading control\\" was based on immunostaining of housekeeping proteins in the classical procedure, but is heading toward total protein staining recently, due to multiple benefits. At least seven different approaches for total protein staining have been described for western blot normalization: Ponceau S, stain-free techniques, Sypro Ruby, Epicocconone, Coomassie R-350, Amido Black, and Cy5. In order to avoid noise of signal, total protein staining should be performed before blocking of the membrane. Nevertheless, post-antibody stainings have been described as well. =Blocking= Since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins, steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein. Blocking of non-specific binding is achieved by placing the membrane in a dilute solution of protein ‚Äì typically 3‚Äì5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or non-fat dry milk (both are inexpensive) in tris-buffered saline (TBS) or I-Block, with a minute percentage (0.1%) of detergent such as Tween 20 or Triton X-100. Although non-fat dry milk is preferred due to its availability, an appropriate blocking solution is needed as not all proteins in milk are compatible with all the detection bands. The protein in the dilute solution attaches to the membrane in all places where the target proteins have not attached. Thus, when the antibody is added, it cannot bind to the membrane, and therefore the only available binding site is the specific target protein. This reduces background in the final product of the western blot, leading to clearer results, and eliminates false positives. =Incubation= During the detection process the membrane is \\"probed\\" for the protein of interest with a modified antibody which is linked to a reporter enzyme; when exposed to an appropriate substrate, this enzyme drives a colorimetric reaction and produces a color. For a variety of reasons, this traditionally takes place in a two-step process, although there are now one- step detection methods available for certain applications. Primary antibody The primary antibodies are generated when a host species or immune cell culture is exposed to the protein of interest (or a part thereof). Normally, this is part of the immune response, whereas here they are harvested and used as sensitive and specific detection tools that bind the protein directly. After blocking, a solution of primary antibody (generally between 0.5 and 5 micrograms/mL) diluted in either PBS or TBST wash buffer is incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation for typically an hour at room temperature, or overnight at 4¬∞C. The antibody solution is incubated with the membrane for anywhere from 30 minutes to overnight. It can also be incubated at different temperatures, with lesser temperatures being associated with more binding, both specific (to the target protein, the \\"signal\\") and non-specific (\\"noise\\"). Following incubation, the membrane is washed several times in wash buffer to remove unbound primary antibody, and thereby minimize background. Typically, the wash buffer solution is composed of buffered saline solution with a small percentage of detergent, and sometimes with powdered milk or BSA. Secondary antibody After rinsing the membrane to remove unbound primary antibody, the membrane is exposed to another antibody known as the secondary antibody. Antibodies come from animal sources (or animal sourced hybridoma cultures). The secondary antibody recognises and binds to the species-specific portion of the primary antibody. Therefore, an anti-mouse secondary antibody will bind to almost any mouse-sourced primary antibody, and can be referred to as an 'anti-species' antibody (e.g. anti-mouse, anti-goat etc.). To allow detection of the target protein, the secondary antibody is commonly linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. This means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one primary antibody and enhance the signal, allowing the detection of proteins of a much lower concentration than would be visible by SDS-PAGE alone. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is commonly linked to secondary antibodies to allow the detection of the target protein by chemiluminescence. The chemiluminscent substrate is cleaved by HRP, resulting in the production of luminescence. Therefore, the production of luminescence is proportional to the amount of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and therefore, indirectly measures the presence of the target protein. A sensitive sheet of photographic film is placed against the membrane, and exposure to the light from the reaction creates an image of the antibodies bound to the blot. A cheaper but less sensitive approach utilizes a 4-chloronaphthol stain with 1% hydrogen peroxide; the reaction of peroxide radicals with 4-chloronaphthol produces a dark purple stain that can be photographed without using specialized photographic film. Western blot binding As with the ELISPOT and ELISA procedures, the enzyme can be provided with a substrate molecule that will be converted by the enzyme to a colored reaction product that will be visible on the membrane (see the figure below with blue bands). Another method of secondary antibody detection utilizes a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore-linked antibody. The light produced from the excitation of a fluorescent dye is static, making fluorescent detection a more precise and accurate measure of the difference in the signal produced by labeled antibodies bound to proteins on a western blot. Proteins can be accurately quantified because the signal generated by the different amounts of proteins on the membranes is measured in a static state, as compared to chemiluminescence, in which light is measured in a dynamic state. A third alternative is to use a radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or Streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage of this approach is the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant). One step Historically, the probing process was performed in two steps because of the relative ease of producing primary and secondary antibodies in separate processes. This gives researchers and corporations huge advantages in terms of flexibility, reduction of cost, and adds an amplification step to the detection process. Given the advent of high- throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection, however, there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems that would allow the process to occur faster and with fewer consumables. This requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label, probes which are often available for known protein tags. The primary probe is incubated with the membrane in a manner similar to that for the primary antibody in a two-step process, and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps. Western blot using radioactive detection system =Detection and visualization= After the unbound probes are washed away, the western blot is ready for detection of the probes that are labeled and bound to the protein of interest. In practical terms, not all westerns reveal protein only at one band in a membrane. Size approximations are taken by comparing the stained bands to that of the marker or ladder loaded during electrophoresis. The process is commonly repeated for a structural protein, such as actin or tubulin, that should not change between samples. The amount of target protein is normalized to the structural protein to control between groups. A superior strategy is the normalization to the total protein visualized with trichloroethanol or epicocconone. This practice ensures correction for the amount of total protein on the membrane in case of errors or incomplete transfers. (see western blot normalization) Colorimetric detection The colorimetric detection method depends on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the secondary antibody. This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different color that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels are evaluated through densitometry (how intense the stain is) or spectrophotometry. Chemiluminescent detection Chemiluminescent detection methods depend on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody. The light is then detected by CCD cameras which capture a digital image of the western blot or photographic film. The use of film for western blot detection is slowly disappearing because of non linearity of the image (non accurate quantification). The image is analysed by densitometry, which evaluates the relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density. Newer software allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis if appropriate standards are used. Western blot chemiluminescent detection Radioactive detection Radioactive labels do not require enzyme substrates, but rather, allow the placement of medical X-ray film directly against the western blot, which develops as it is exposed to the label and creates dark regions which correspond to the protein bands of interest (see image above). The importance of radioactive detections methods is declining due to its hazardous radiation , because it is very expensive, health and safety risks are high, and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) provides a useful alternative. Fluorescent detection The fluorescently labeled probe is excited by light and the emission of the excitation is then detected by a photosensor such as a CCD camera equipped with appropriate emission filters which captures a digital image of the western blot and allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis and a quantitative western blot analysis. Fluorescence is considered to be one of the best methods for quantification but is less sensitive than chemiluminescence. =Secondary probing= One major difference between nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes relates to the ability of each to support \\"stripping\\" antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes. While there are well- established protocols available for stripping nitrocellulose membranes, the sturdier PVDF allows for easier stripping, and for more reuse before background noise limits experiments. Another difference is that, unlike nitrocellulose, PVDF must be soaked in 95% ethanol, isopropanol or methanol before use. PVDF membranes also tend to be thicker and more resistant to damage during use.mugilan 2-D gel electrophoresis Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE uses the principles and techniques outlined above. 2-D SDS-PAGE, as the name suggests, involves the migration of polypeptides in 2 dimensions. For example, in the first dimension, polypeptides are separated according to isoelectric point, while in the second dimension, polypeptides are separated according to their molecular weight. The isoelectric point of a given protein is determined by the relative number of positively (e.g. lysine, arginine) and negatively (e.g. glutamate, aspartate) charged amino acids, with negatively charged amino acids contributing to a low isoelectric point and positively charged amino acids contributing to a high isoelectric point. Samples could also be separated first under nonreducing conditions using SDS-PAGE, and under reducing conditions in the second dimension, which breaks apart disulfide bonds that hold subunits together. SDS-PAGE might also be coupled with urea- PAGE for a 2-dimensional gel. In principle, this method allows for the separation of all cellular proteins on a single large gel. A major advantage of this method is that it often distinguishes between different isoforms of a particular protein - e.g. a protein that has been phosphorylated (by addition of a negatively charged group). Proteins that have been separated can be cut out of the gel and then analysed by mass spectrometry, which identifies their molecular weight.

During World War II, in which Sweden maintained a policy of neutrality, he presided over a government of national unity that included all major parties in the Riksdag with the exception of the Communist Party.Swedish Encyclopedia \\"Bonniers Lexikon\\", 1960s, known as \\"the Apple\\", vol 6:15, article \\"Hansson, Per Albin\\", column 837 \\"Han ombildade dec. 1939 regeringen till en √§ven folkpartiet och h√∂gern ommfattande samlingsminist√§r, som fungerade till juli 1945. Genom f√∂rsiktig utrikespolitik s√∂kte han bevara Sveriges neutralitet\\" Forging the Social Democratic grip on Swedish politics that would last throughout the century, Hansson left an astounding legacy on his party as well as creating the idea of Sweden to become \\"Folkhemmet\\", \\"The People's Home\\".Swedish Encyclopedia \\"Bonniers Lexikon\\", 1960s, known as \\"the Apple\\", vol 6:15, article \\"Hansson, Per Albin\\", column 836-837 \\"Partiets m√•ls√§ttning skulle enligt Hansson (1928) vara att g√∂ra Sverige till ett 'folkhem' \\". This remained intact until the early 1990s, including a strict policy of neutrality, a wide-stretching welfare state through parliamentary legislation, and reformist social corporatism rather than Marxist socialization of the means of production. Following the war, Hansson formed a Social Democratic cabinet enjoying absolute majority in the Riksdag before succumbing to a heart attack on his way home from work late at night on 6 October 1946. During Hansson's fourteen years as Prime Minister of Sweden, a wide range of reforms were realised, such as subsidised dental care, income-tested child allowances for invalidity pensioners and widows, maternity allowances through voluntary sickness insurance, and a 1935 law that introduced state subsidies for the construction of apartment houses for families with three or more children, combined with housing allowances for families with more than two children living in these houses.Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora Early life and career The birthplace of Per Albin Hansson Per Albin Hansson was born in Kulladal, a neighborhood in Malm√∂, Sweden, on 28 October 1885. One of the first professional politicians of Sweden, Hansson participated in the creation of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth in 1903 and presided over it as its chairman in 1908‚Äì09, a period in which universal suffrage and proportional representation was gradually to be enacted for all Swedish males by Conservative Prime Minister Arvid Lindman, later a rival of Hansson. Influenced generally by Karl Kautsky's views on socialism, Hansson succeeded Hjalmar Branting as editor of Social-Demokraten in 1917 and was appointed his Minister of Defence in Sweden's first Social Democratic cabinet in 1920, following a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition enacting equal suffrage for men and women (in effect as of the 1921 election). Per Albin Hansson held this office in all of Branting's three cabinets between 1920 and 1925 (years which saw eight governments), performing numerous cut-backs on the military budget. Upon Branting's death in 1925, Hansson rose to be embraced as chairman of the party. His legitimacy remained under dispute, however, and only in 1927 did he become the head of the Riksdag faction, before having been confirmed undisputedly as Branting's successor in a 1928 congress. Upon losing power to Carl Gustaf Ekman's pro-prohibition Liberals in 1926, Hansson worked from the opposition bench and, although heading what was to remain the largest party of the Riksdag to date, faced a major setback upon cooperating with the Communists in the infamous election of 1928. Hansson's party did poorly as a result, and not until the 2010 election would the Social Democrats and the Communists (the latter changed its name, in 1995, to the Left Party) would the two parties run in tandem again. In opposition to the Conservative ‚Äì though equally pragmatic and staunchly anti-fascist ‚Äì Lindman cabinet, Hansson pressed for the introduction of a welfare state rather than wide-scale nationalizations. He called his vision Folkhemmet (\\"the People's Home\\") in a Riksdag debate in 1928. Following the fall of Ekman in 1932 due to a corruption scandal involving the recently deceased industrialist Ivar Kreuger, the Social Democrats made gains, which altogether gave them 104 Riksdag seats and 41.7% of the popular vote. Though this left them short of a majority, they benefited from the inability of the Liberal parties (themselves unable to form a single faction until 1934), the Conservatives and the Agrarians to form a stable administration of their own. This inability gave Hansson his chance. He courted and eventually obtained support from the Farmers' League, through promising an agriculture policy favoring the interests of the League (kohandeln), although he stopped short of giving League parliamentarians any cabinet posts. In June 1936, the combined efforts of the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Agrarians brought the Hansson-led government to an end and ensured Hansson's own resignation as Prime Minister. Following Hansson's departure, League chairman Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp was able to form a three- month \\"Vacation Cabinet\\". That lasted until the elections in September, which saw a rise in support of the Social Democrats. This time Hansson invited certain League members into the cabinet, and Pehrsson-Brahmstorp therefore became Minister of Agriculture. The administration enjoyed a substantial parliamentary majority that lasted until 1939. World War II Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Hansson declared strict neutrality and called for the formation of a broad coalition government involving all major parties under his leadership, which was realized in December except only the pro-Stalinist Communist Party and its short-lived pro-German splinter faction, the Socialist Party.http://www.ne.se/school/lang/socialistiska- partiet Alone in Europe save for Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Ireland and the Vatican, Sweden maintained neutrality throughout all World War II, but like the mentioned countries, cooperated and traded with both sides. Winston Churchill claimed that Sweden during World War II ignored the greater moral issues and played both sides for profit, a criticism mimicked in criticism towards Sweden's policy towards the German occupation of Denmark and Norway upheld partly by transportation reinforcement through Swedish territory, sanctioned by Hansson's cabinet.Winston Churchill ‚Äì The Second World War. The German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Operation Barbarossa sparked an ultimatum known as the Midsommarkrisen by the government of Nazi Germany to Hansson's cabinet, demanding some military concessions, including German troop transports on Swedish railways in order to support Germany's ally Finland. Political deliberations surrounding this ultimatum have been dubbed the \\"midsummer crisis\\", which ultimately, allegedly following King Gustav V's decision to resign should the concessions not be made, fell out in favor of the Axis. The 83-year-old king formally (although having not directly intervened in the government's policies since 1914) had the powers to appoint his own cabinet, and his open intervention in the issue was seen as a threat to the stability of the government and, given the ongoing war, to the sovereignty of the nation. Recent research by Carl-Gustaf Scott argues however that there never was a \\"crisis\\" and that \\"the crisis was created in historical hindsight in order to protect the political legacy of the Social Democratic Party and its leader Per Albin Hansson.\\" Carl-Gustaf Scott, \\"The Swedish Midsummer Crisis of 1941: The Crisis that Never Was\\" Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 37, No. 3, 371‚Äì394 (2002) (SAGE JOURNALS ONLINE) To get the steel required by the German Ruhr and Upper Silesia industry, Germany was, in 1939‚Äì1940, dependent on shipments of Swedish iron ore, since access to the supplies from the mines in France, the traditional supplier, were cut off until the invasion of France. In 1939‚Äì1940 the Allies tried various ways to stop the shipments of Swedish ore, for example by mining Norwegian territorial waters. A downed stray V2 rocket was also sold to the Allies in 1942, passing details of advanced Nazi rocket engineering over. In effect, the main political priority was to avoid direct war engagement of Sweden during World War II. Following Germany's setbacks around 1942‚Äì43, Sweden was no longer seriously threatened by invasion from the Third Reich and subsequently rolled back most of its concessions. Death and political legacy Following the surrender of Germany, Hansson wanted to maintain a Social Democratic-led coalition government of all non-Communist parties. However, he failed to achieve this as a result of strong opposition within his own party which favoured a radical reformist agenda following the war. Hansson reluctantly agreed to a single-party government. He had abandoned his early revolutionary and strictly anti-militarist views in favor of social corporatism, class collaboration and a reformist agenda involving few nationalizations but stable armed forces in order to secure neutrality. He died from a heart attack in Stockholm on 6 October 1946 while stepping off a tram at the √Ölstens G√•rd station. He was succeeded as party chairman and Prime Minister by Minister of Education Tage Erlander, who held both offices concurrently until 1969, completing most of Hansson's legacy. Per Albin Hansson, seen often as the most successful Prime Minister in Swedish history, is interred in Norra Begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

She has been called \\"the greatest Flamenco dancer ever Clarke, Mary & Crisp, Clement 1981. The history of dance. Orbis, London. p60 and \\"the most extraordinary personality of all time in flamenco dance.\\"Clarke, Mary & Vaughan, David 1977. The encyclopedia of dance & ballet. Pitman, London. p316 She was the first female flamenco dancer to master footwork previously reserved for the best male dancers, due to its speed and intensity. She sometimes danced in high-waisted trousers as a symbol of her strong character. Biography She was born to a Gypsy Spanish family, to Jos√© Amaya Amaya \\"El Chino ( \\"The Chinaman\\"),\\" a guitar player, and Micaela Amaya Moreno. Carmen was the second of eleven children, although only six (three sisters and two brothers) survived to adulthood. Her date of birth is disputed. Montse Madridejos and David P√©rez Merinero name 1918 as year of birth. They name Barcelano's inhabitanta list of 1930, in which a family AmallaThe pronunciation of Amaya and Amalla in Spanish is essentially equal. There are also later documents such as event posters and photos, in which Carmen Amaya's family name is spelled Amalla, see e.g. with a 12-year-old daughter Carmen is mentioned. They claim that no birth document is available and the document of baptism was lost due to a church fire.Madridejos & P√©rez Merinero, p. 21 Furthermore, a 1920 oil painting by Julio Mois√©s named Maternidad, showing a mother with a small girl, due to them portraits Carmen and her mother Micaela.Madridejos & P√©rez Merinero, p. 24 According to them, photografies showing Carmen Amaya as a teenage child also speak for 1918 as the year of birth.Madridejos & P√©rez Merinero, p. 46‚Äì49 Her ethnicity could also be a factor in her birth date's ambiguity, according to Montse Madridejos, professor of Music History at the University of Barcelona and a flamenco history researcher, who has a special interest in Carmen Amaya: ‚ÄúAt this time, a gypsy was neither baptized, nor registered‚Äù. However Jos√© Luis Navarro Garc√≠a, c√°tedra de flamencolog√≠a,university professor of flamencology as well as most other sourcessee e.g. or name November 2, 1913. His point of view is supported by performances in a club in Madrid in 1923, unlikely for a 5-year- old child, and a quote by Carmen Amaya herself in which she refers to her performance at the 1929 world exhibition: > ¬´... en la Exposici√≥n de Barcelona de 1929, yo ten√≠a dieciseis a√±os ...¬ª > ‚Äú... at the Barcelona exhibition in 1929, when i was sixteen years old ...‚Äù After all her death certificate names November 1, 1915 as date of birth,Madridejos & P√©rez Merinero, p. 65 and so does the Library of Congress. Amaya started in the flamenco world accompanied by her father, a poor guitarist who made a living by playing in pubs day and night. When Carmen was only 4 years old, she started going out with her father at night. He accompanied her on the guitar while she performed. Afterwards, they begged and picked the small change that the public would throw on the floor. Soon earned her first nickname, \\"La Capitana.\\" At the same time, she started to appear in some lesser known theatres but thanks to Josep Santpere, a bright variety shows businessman, who was the first one who showed interest in Carmen and introduced her to a more prestigious category, she made her debut at the Spanish Theatre in Barcelona at the age of six. Soon after, she was performing at the Palace Theatre in Paris. Inconveniently, because of her age, she wasn't eligible to work legally, and therefore it is likely that the artist's date of birth is not entirely accurate, according to recent findings. The first time her name appeared in print was during the International Fair of Barcelona in 1929 thanks to Sebasti√† Gasch, an art critic who saw her and wrote an article in the weekly newspaper . Sebastian Gash wrote: > Suddenly a jump! And the gypsy girl danced. Indescribable. Soul. Pure Soul. > Feeling made flesh. The floorboards vibrated with unprecedented brutality > and incredible precision. La Capitana was a gross product of Nature. Like > all gypsies, She must have been born dancing.

At this point Vicente Escudero, an important businessman, saw her dancing and promised that Carmen would create a flamenco revolution because of her perfect synthesis of two important styles: the style of the old dancer, and the quivering style of the dancer in their varieties. In 1930, she was part of the Manuel Vallejo company, performing all over Spain. On her return to Barcelona she danced at the Teatro Espa√±ol, recommended by Jos√© Cepero. In 1929, she appeared in the tablao Villa Rosa poster in Madrid and in 1930, she performed in the International Exhibition. That year she worked in the Zarzuela Theatre, also known as the Coliseum, in Madrid with Conchita Piquer, Miguel de Molina, and other famous artists, and at the Fontalba Theatre. That was the authentic success of Carmen nationwide. She played a small roll in La hija de Juan Sim√≥n and Maria de la O, and she also worked for a musical magazine in Barcelona. From her first performance‚Äù in 1935 to her last performance in ‚ÄúLos Tarantos‚Äù her dancing showcases the value of the purest form of the flamenco. Her films are momentous in the sense that there have been very few cases in which films have been created around one figure and there is where all the dancers who define their dance as being ‚Äúof temperament‚Äù can find a model. Very seldom in the history of New York have dance and flamenco reached such success as they reached under Carmen Amaya's influence. Juan Carceller hired her for a tour. She traveled to several capitals, including San Sebasti√°n. In 1935, Luisita Esteo presented her in Madrid, in a show at the Coliseum. On The 18th of July in 1936, when the coup in Spain took place, Carmen and her team were in the Zorrilla Theatre in Valladolid, working for Carcell√©'s company. At that time, they were financially secure and she had bought her first car. They were due to go to Lisbon to sign the lease, but the car was requisitioned and they could not travel to Portugal until November. In 1952 she married guitarist Juan Antonio Ag√ºero, a member of her troupe. A man belonging to a distinguished family from Santander, who was not a gypsy. They lived an authentic love story and celebrated an intimate wedding. In 1959, Carmen experienced one of the most exciting moments of her life, when the inauguration ceremony of the fountain whose name was put on was held. The fountain was placed on the Paseo Mar√≠timo de Barcelona, which crosses the neighborhood of Somorrostro, the same places where she had walked by many years before, barefoot and dragging her misery as a child. In 1988 the Tablao de Carmen was founded in the Poble Espanyol as an homage to Carmen Amaya in the very place where she danced for the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII, during the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition inauguration. Tablao de Carmen displays some of the photo legacy of Carmen Amaya. The guitar of her husband Juan Antonio Ag√ºero (by Santos Hern√°ndez 1930) is a part of the patrimony of the founder family of Tablao de Carmen and it is played in Tablao on special occasions. =Beginning of international success: South America and Central America (1936-1940)= In 1936, when the Spanish Civil War had just begun, Carmen Amaya and her troupe were on tour in Valladolid with Luisita Esteso's show. They crossed the border from Spain to Portugal and, after a short time arrived in Lisbon, they sailed for Buenos Aires on the ship Monte Pascoal, which took fifteen days to cross the Atlantic and put in at Brazil and Uruguay. She debuted in Buenos Aires, accompanied by Ram√≥n Montoya and Sabicas at the Maravillas Theatre. During this stage of her life, she added to her artistic group several members of her family. She made films in Buenos Aires with Miguel de Molina and won the admiration of musicians Arturo Toscanini and Leopold Stokowski, who publicly praised her. The success of Carmen Amaya and her family exceeded all expectations. They planned to stay for only four weeks and, finally, they stayed there for nine months, since every time Carmen performed the theatre was filled and tickets were even sold two months in advance. A good example of the enormous popularity that the artist achieved in this South American country is the construction of the theatre that bears her name: el Teatro Amaya. In addition, it seems that during most of those years in America the bailaora maintained a personal relationship with Sabicas, who declared shortly before his death that he and Carmen had been dating for nine years, and that they had split up in Mexico. =Consolidation in the United States (1941-1947)= In The US , Carmen Amaya met many of the most influential people of that time. She went several times to Hollywood to film some movies and the most important personalities of cinema, music or culture wanted to see her dance. The musician Toscanini saw one of her performances once and declared that he had never seen an artist with more rhythm and more fire than her. She improvised continuously, as quickly as perfectly. She traveled to New York in 1941 and performed at Carnegie Hall with Sabicas and Antonio de Triana. When in the United States, she also met Franklin Roosevelt, President of the United States. It was reported that after seeing her, the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, gave her a bowling jacket with brilliants and invited her to dance at the White House. She returned to Europe and performed at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, to do so later in London, when she got to meet the Queen of England. =Return to Spain= When Carmen Amaya returned to Spain in 1947, she already was an indisputable universal figure. The years that she had been in America made her not only to professionally establish her art, but also to make her legend grow unstoppable. By then, her dance was the bravest flamenco that had ever come to the theatre. But she did not stand out only because of her art, but also because of her fascinating personality, which won everyone she knew, both because of her dancing and because of her unpredictable behaviour. Besides, she was extraordinarily generous. She was a great success at the London Princess Theatre in 1948, and also on her next American tour. She toured Argentina again in 1950. She returned to dance in Spain the following year, performing at the Tivoli theatro in Barcelona after several performances in Rome. She continued her work in Madrid, Paris, London, and different cities in Germany, Italy, and other European countries. The queen of England congratulated her when she performed there; Carmen Amaya and Elizabeth II appeared together in a newspaper photograph entitled: \\"Two queens face to face.\\" In subsequent years she continued her work in northern Europe, France, Spain, the United States, Mexico, and South America. She triumphed at the Westminster Theatre in London and at La Zarzuela theatre in Madrid in 1959. At that time, Barcelona constructed a tribute to Carmen Amaya by building the Carmen Fountain in her old district, Somorrostro, to popular acclaim. She recorded her last film, Los Tarantos, by Rovira-Beleta in 1963, and she continued working. At the end, her illness prevented her from continuing in Gand√≠a. The last time she danced was in Malaga. Her illness was exacerbated by the filming of latest film, Los Tarantos, directed by Rovira-Beleta (1963). In spite of these inconveniences, Carmen strongly overcame, and, at the end of filming, she started a summer tour. The last time she performed in Madrid, Carmen Amaya was already deathly ill. Finally, her illness stopped her from performing, a kind of renal impairment that impeded her properly eliminating the toxins that her body accumulated. The doctors could not find any solution to her problem. She danced for the last time in Malaga. On August 8, 1963, whilst she was working in Gand√≠a, Carmen finished her performance. She was dancing when suddenly she said to Batista: \\"Andr√©s, we finished.\\" =Death= During the last ten years of her life, she lived surrounded by people and almost sanctified, not only for her audience, but for those who worked with her. Her nature was instinctive, animalistic, and had little to do with academic learning. Carmen Amaya died in Begur, Girona, northeast Catalonia, in 1963 and is buried in the Cemetery of Ciriego at Santander. She died due to kidney disease. Her death was a great loss to all the Flamenco world. She was awarded the Medal of Merit of Tourism in Barcelona, the Lasso of the Lady of the Order of Isabel la Cat√≥lica award, and given the title of Adoptive Daughter of Begur. Three years after her death (1966) she was honored by a monument constructed in the Amusement Park of Montjuic. Buenos Aires has a street dedicated to her. In Madrid in the \\"Tablao\\" Los Califas, she was honored by a tribute performance in which many artists participated, including Lucero Tena, Mariquilla, and Felix de Utrera. = Medals and recognition awards = Her death was a great loss for the entire Flamenco world, as she was awarded with the Medalla del M√©rito Tur√≠stico de Barcelona, Lazo de Isabel la Cat√≥lica and the title of Hija Adoptiva de Bagur. Her funeral summoned a large number of Roma People from different parts of Spain and even France. Buried in Bagur, where she spent her last days, her remains rest in the pantheon of her husband's family, in Santander. Three years after her death in 1966, her monument was inaugurated in the Parque de Montjuic in Barcelona, and in Buenos Aires, while in Madrid, in Tablao Los Califas, a tribute, led by Lucero Tena, among other artists, took place. She was also honored in Llafranch (Girona) in 1970. The personality of Carmen Amaya, has been glossed by critics, flamencologists and writers, as well as by poets, including Fernando Qui√±ones, author of the poem Soneto y letras en vivo para Car men Amaya. A selected transcription of these comments by Vicente Marrero, reads: Carmen Amaya can see the amazing conviction that sometimes tends to dance. \\"Gitanilla\\" ungainly, skinny, petite, almost disembodied. Brunette, with a tragic and remote idol face, Asian cheekbones, with long eyes full of omens, twisted arms. With her \\"repajolera\\" gypsy [Romani] grace, she is not just another millionaire in North America, but one of our great dancers, who has succeeded, with the secret of dance and her dance she was born to dance, and she danced phenomenally. Carmen Amaya, is her name, is not a different woman in each of her dances, as so often happens with other great dance figures. Carmen's flamenco legacy is still valid to this day. Dancing with force, meter, intensity and power. A way of expression which brought an end to the sweetness of flamenco which had endured until that point. The known producer Sol Hurok described Carmen as ‚ÄúThe Human Vesuvius.‚Äù Carmen Amaya has been the incarnation of the flamenco dance par excellent. Her dancing is reflected in a large number of films. Carmen Rupe took her name from Amaya.

In 1973, she founded the all-black female a cappella ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock, based in Washington, D.C. Reagon, along with other members of the SNCC Freedom Singers, realized the power of collective singing to unify the disparate groups who began to work together in the 1964 Freedom Summer protests in the South. > ‚ÄúAfter a song,‚Äù Reagon recalled, ‚Äúthe differences between us were not so > great.

Reagon devoted her life to social justice through music via recordings, activism, community singing, and scholarship. She earned her Ph.D. from Howard University becoming a cultural historian, centered on the role of music, and is an emeritus faculty member in the History Department at The American University. She has also been a scholar-in-residence at Stanford and received an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music. Early life and education Bernice Johnson was the daughter of Beatrice and J.J. Johnson, a Baptist minister. She was born and raised in southwest Georgia, where church and school were an integrated part of her life, with music heavily intertwined in both of those settings. Reagon began school at the age of three when she was asked by her teacher to attend early, and she passed that first year. By the time she was in the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade, she was requested to tutor students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and she claims it was because there had only been one teacher. She entered Albany State College in 1959 (since July 1996 Albany State University) where she began her study of music. She also became active in the local NAACP chapter and then the SNCC. After being expelled from Albany State because of an arrest as an activist, she briefly attended Spelman College. Later, she returned to Spelman to complete her undergraduate degree in 1970. She received a Ford Foundation fellowship to do graduate study at Howard University, where she was awarded the Ph.D. degree in 1975. Career =Activism= Reagon's first demonstration had been in protest against the arrest of Bertha Gober, and Blanton Hall, organized by SNCC along with the initial arrest of the two individuals, for they planned to be arrested in a discussion during a SNCC meeting. Reagon was an active participant in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. She was a member of The Freedom Singers, organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), for which she also served as a field secretary. Reagon explains her first encounter with SNCC as a confusion, for she did not understand the name, or its organization, but she claims that she understood that they were for freedom and full-time. The Freedom Singers were organized by Cordell Reagon in 1962. The group was the first of the civil rights singers to travel nationally. The singers realized that singing helped provide an outlet and unifier for protestors struggling with mob behavior and police brutality. Thanks to her roles with SNCC and the Freedom Singers, Reagon became a highly respected song leader during the Civil Rights Movement. Activist James Forman later said, \\"I remember seeing you lift your beautiful black head, stand squarely on your feet, your lips trembling as the melodious words 'Over my head, I see freedom in the air' came forth with an urgency and a pain that brought out a sense of intense renewal and commitment of liberation. And when the call came to protest the jailings, you were up front. You led the line. Your feet hit the dirty pavement with a sureness of direction. You walked proudly onward singing 'this little light of mine, 'and the people echoed, 'shine, shine, shine.'\\" =Academic= In 1974, Reagon was appointed as a cultural historian in music history at the Smithsonian Institution, where she directed a program called Black American Culture in 1976, and was later a curator of music history for the National Museum of American History. Ida Jones from the Smithsonian Institution had stated, \\"Dr. Reagon collected photographs,sheet music, and other primary and secondary sources chronicling the development of African American sacred music tradition from its birth during the period of slavery through the creation of concert spiritual, gospel music, jazz, and the performance of protest song in the century following Emancipation.\\" on behalf on Reagon's initial job at the museum. In 1989, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. After Reagon retired in 1993, she continued to work in African American Songs of Protest as a Curator Emeritus. She held an appointment as Distinguished Professor of History at American University (AU) in Washington DC from 1993 to 2003. Reagon has since been named Professor Emerita of History at AU, and holds the title of Curator Emeritus at the Smithsonian. =Music= Reagon claimed that she grew up in a church without a piano, so her early music was a cappella, and her first instruments were her hands and feet, and she explains, \\"that's the only way I can deal comfortably with creating music.\\" When Reagon speaks upon her upbringing in the musical culture, she explains that even her early schooling was heavily involved with music, not just the church. Reagon says that her teacher would lead the students outside to play games that entailed singing with their hands and feet, as well as their voices. There was also competitions among the students, and Reagon won first place as a child when running against the older students reciting Langston Hughes, \\"I've Known Rivers\\". Reagon is a specialist in African- American oral history, performance and protest traditions. She has served as music consultant, producer, composer, and performer on several award-winning film projects, notably PBS television productions such as Eyes on the Prize (1987) (in which she also appeared) and Ken Burns' The Civil War (1990). Reagon was also featured in a film, \\"We Shall Overcome\\" which was about the song and its placement in the movement, being produced by Ginger Records and made by Henry Hampton, the same creator of Eyes on The Prize. She was the conceptual producer and narrator of the Peabody Award-winning radio series, Wade in the Water, African American Sacred Music Traditions. Reagon claimed, \\"These days, I come as a 'songtalker', one who balances talk and song in the creation of a live performance conversation with those who gather within the sound of my voice.\\" Reagon joined her first and only gospel choir when she was eleven years old, which was organized by her sister at the Mt. Early Baptist Church. She and the choir would listen to the local radio station WGPC to learn black gospel for the choir to recite. As a child, the Five Blind Guys was her favorite quartet. Reagon states that her role models in terms of music are Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, and Bessie Jones, because they assisted her understanding of traditional singing and the fight for justice. She also sees Deacon Reardon as an importance to her work as a historian studying African American sacred worship traditions, and she states that he impacted both her spiritual and musical development. Reagon's work as a scholar and composer is reflected in her publications on African-American culture and history, including: a collection of essays entitled If You Don‚Äôt Go, Don‚Äôt Hinder Me: The African American Sacred Song Tradition (University of Nebraska Press, 2001); We Who Believe In Freedom: Sweet Honey In The Rock: Still on the Journey, (Anchor Books, 1993); and We'll Understand It Better By And By: Pioneering African American Gospel Composers (Smithsonian Press, 1992). Reagon has recorded several albums on Folkways Records including Folk Songs: The South, Wade in the Water, and Lest We Forget, Vol. 3: Sing for Freedom.Bernice Johnson Reagon Discography on Folkways. Folkways.si.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-09. In 1973 Reagon founded a six-member, all-female a cappella group called Sweet Honey in the Rock. In addition to Reagon, the women in the original group were: Ysaye Maria Barnwell, Nitanju Bolade Casle, Shirley Childress Johnson, Aisha Kahil, and Carol Maillard. The only instrument they used was their voices, along with shekere and tambourine. They have toured internationally, including to Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Australia. The group's fan base is of different ethnic backgrounds, religions, and sexual orientations. Reagon's musical roots come from the rural South Baptist Church. She has advocated \\"music's informational and transformative power to ask\\" and the strong effects that music has had on the Civil Rights Movement. Honors *In 1991 Reagon received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women. *In 1995 she received a Charles Frankel Prize for her contributions to the public understanding of the humanities.

Personal life In 1963 she married Cordell Reagon, another member of The Freedom Singers.Hopkinson, Natalie . Crisis, The. Sep/Oct 2003 Their daughter Toshi Reagon is also a singer-songwriter. Reagon believes that \\"Life's challenges are not supposed to paralyze you, they're supposed to help you discover who you are.\\" She believes that black people have created their own world. African Americans had to use what ever territory at their disposal to create a people. And that territory was not land, it was culture. She also said there was so much done because black culture was the only thing black people could call their own. That is why she feels black culture is the most powerful in the world.

Early life Edwin Catmull was born on March 31, 1945, in Parkersburg, West Virginia. His family later moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where his father first served as principal of Granite High School and then of Taylorsville High School. Early in life, Catmull found inspiration in Disney movies, including Peter Pan and Pinocchio, and dreamed of becoming a feature film animator. He also made animation using flip-books. Catmull graduated in 1969, with a B.S. in physics and computer science from the University of Utah. Initially interested in designing programming languages, Catmull encountered Ivan Sutherland, who had designed the computer drawing program Sketchpad, and changedhis interest to digital imaging. As a student of Sutherland, he was part of the university's ARPA program, sharing classes with James H. Clark, John Warnock and Alan Kay. From that point, his main goal and ambition were to make digitally realistic films.Innerview - Edwin Catmull During his time at the university, he made two new fundamental computer-graphics discoveries: texture mapping and bicubic patches; and invented algorithms for spatial anti- aliasing and refining subdivision surfaces. He also independently discovered Z-buffering,, which had been described, 8 months before, by Wolfgang Stra√üer in his PhD thesis.Stra√üer, Wolfgang. Schnelle Kurven- und Fl√§chendarstellung auf graphischen Sichtger√§ten, Dissertation, TU Berlin, submitted April 26, 1974 In 1972, Catmull made his earliest contribution to the film industry: an animated version of his left hand which was eventually picked up by a Hollywood producer and incorporated in the 1976 movie Futureworld, the first film to use 3D computer graphics and a science-fiction sequel to the 1973 film Westworld, which was the first to use a pixelated image generated by a computer. The one-minute sequence was created with Fred Parke at the University of Utah. Titled A Computer Animated Hand, the short film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in December 2011. Career =Early career= In 1974, Catmull earned his doctorate in computer science, was hired by a company called Applicon, and by November the same year had been contacted by the founder of the New York Institute of Technology, Alexander Schure, who offered him the position as the director of the new Computer Graphics Lab at NYIT. In that position in 1977 he invented Tween, software for 2D animation that automatically produced frames of motion in between two frames. However, Catmull's team lacked the ability to tell a story effectively via film, harming the effort to produce a motion picture via a computer. Catmull and his partner Alvy Ray Smith attempted to reach out to studios to alleviate this issue, but were generally unsuccessful until they attracted the attention of George Lucas at Lucasfilm. =Lucasfilm= Lucas approached Catmull in 1979 and asked him to lead a group to bring computer graphics, video editing, and digital audio into the entertainment field. Lucas had already made a deal with a computer company called Triple-I, and asked them to create a digital model of an X-wing fighter from Star Wars, which they did. In 1979 Catmull became the Vice President at Industrial Light & Magic computer graphics division at Lucasfilm. =Pixar= In 1986, Steve Jobs bought Lucasfilm's digital division and founded Pixar, where Catmull would work. Pixar would be acquired by Disney in 2006. In June 2007, Catmull and long-time Pixar digital animator and director John Lasseter were given control of Disneytoon Studios, a division of Disney Animation housed in a separate facility in Glendale. As president and chief creative officer, respectively, they have supervised three separate studios for Disney, each with its own production pipeline: Pixar, Disney Animation, and Disneytoon. While Disney Animation and Disneytoon are located in the Los Angeles area, Pixar is located over 350 miles (563 kilometers) northwest in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Catmull and Lasseter both live. Accordingly, they appointed a general manager for each studio to handle day- to-day affairs on their behalf, then began regularly commuting each week to both Pixar and Disney Animation and spending at least two days per week (usually Tuesdays and Wednesdays) at Disney Animation. While at Pixar Catmull was implicated in the High-Tech Employee Antitrust scandal, where Bay Area technology companies agreed, among other things, not to cold-call recruit from one another. Catmull defended his actions in a deposition, saying \\"While I have responsibility for the payroll, I have responsibility for the long term also.\\" Disney and its subsidiaries, including Pixar, ultimately paid $100m in compensation. In November 2014, the general managers of Disney Animation and Pixar were both promoted to president, but both continued to report to Catmull, who retained the title of president of Walt Disney and Pixar. On October 23, 2018, Catmull announced his plans to retire from Pixar and Disney Animation, staying on as an adviser through July 2019. Personal life In 2006, Catmull lived in Marin County, California, with his wife Susan and their three children. Awards and honors In 1993, Catmull received his first Academy Scientific and Technical Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \\"for the development of PhotoRealistic RenderMan software which produces images used in motion pictures from 3D computer descriptions of shape and appearance\\". He shared this award with Tom Porter. In 1995, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Again in 1996, he received an Academy Scientific and Technical Award \\"for pioneering inventions in Digital Image Compositing\\". In 2001, he received an Oscar \\"for significant advancements to the field of motion picture rendering as exemplified in Pixar's RenderMan\\". In 2006, he was awarded the IEEE John von Neumann Medal for pioneering contributions to the field of computer graphics in modeling, animation and rendering. At the 81st Academy Awards (2008, presented in February 2009), Catmull was awarded the Gordon E. Sawyer Award, which honors \\"an individual in the motion picture industry whose technological contributions have brought credit to the industry\\". In 2013, the Computer History Museum named him a Museum Fellow \\"for his pioneering work in computer graphics, animation and filmmaking\\". His book Creativity, Inc. was shortlisted for the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award (2014), and was a selection for Mark Zuckerberg book club in March 2015. Catmull shared the 2019 Turing Award with Pat Hanrahan for their pioneering work on computer-generated imagery.

He is counted among the founders of the Ricardian school of economics. He also wrote the monumental work The History of British India. He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British, a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies, but which is seen in recent decades as being deeply problematic. Mill was the father of John Stuart Mill, a noted philosopher of liberalism and utilitarianism, and a colonial administrator at the East India Company. Biography James Milne, later known as James Mill, was born in Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, Angus, Scotland, the son of James Milne, a shoemaker and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the Stuart rising, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and after the parish school they sent him on to the Montrose Academy, where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the University of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar. In October 1789, he was ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland, but met with little further success. According to John Stuart Mill's Autobiography his father, though \\"educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had by his own studies and reflections been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion.\\"https://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/mill/auto/auto.c02.html From 1790 to 1802, while supporting himself by various tutorships, he also pursued various historical and philosophical studies. With little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London, in company with Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn, then member of parliament for Kincardineshire, and devoted himself to his literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the Literary Journal, which tried to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the St James's Chronicle, published by the same proprietor. In 1804 he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade arguing against a tariff (or 'bounty') on the export of grain. In 1805 he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther by Charles de Villers on the Reformation, and an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system. About the end of this year he began work on The History of British India, which was to occupy him for twelve years rather than the three or four that he had expected. In that year too he married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in Hoxton. They took a house in Pentonville where their eldest son John Stuart Mill was born in 1806. The back of No. 19, York Street (1848). In 1651 John Milton moved into a \\"pretty garden-house\\" in Petty France. He lived there until the Restoration. Later it became No. 19 York Street, belonged to Jeremy Bentham, was occupied successively by James Mill and William Hazlitt, and was demolished in 1877. In 1808 he became acquainted with Jeremy Bentham, who was twenty-five years his senior, and for many years his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the Anti-Jacobin Review, the British Review and The Eclectic Review; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the more prominent Edinburgh Review, to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being \\"Money and Exchange\\". He also wrote on Spanish America, China, Francisco de Miranda, the East India Company, and freedom of the press. In the Annual Review for 1808 two articles of his are traced ‚Äì a \\"Review of Fox's History\\", and an article on \\"Bentham's Law Reforms\\", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811 he co-operated with William Allen (1770‚Äì1843), a Quaker and chemist, in a periodical called the Philanthropist. He contributed largely to every issue ‚Äì his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's Panopticon). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the Bell and Lancaster controversy, and took a part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the University of London in 1825. In 1814 he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of utilitarianism, for the supplement to the fifth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the most important being those on \\"Jurisprudence\\", \\"Prisons\\", \\"Government\\" and \\"Law of Nations\\". The History of British India was published in 1818, and obtained a great immediate and enduring success. It brought about a matching change in the author's fortunes, and in the year following he was appointed an official in India House in the important department of the Examiner of Indian Correspondence. He gradually rose through the ranks until in 1830 he was appointed head of the office, with a salary of ¬£1900, raised in 1836 to ¬£2000. His great work on economics, the Elements of Political Economy, appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825). From 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed a number of articles to the Westminster Review, the organ of the Radical party, in which he attacked the Edinburgh and the Quarterly Reviews, and the ecclesiastical establishment. In 1829 appeared the Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of its Court of Directors. For the London Review, founded by Sir William Molesworth in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled \\"The Church and its Reform\\", which was much too sceptical for the time and injured the Westminster Review. Mill himself was an atheist.https://mises.org/library/james-mill-laissez-faires-lenin His last published book was the Fragment on Mackintosh (1835). Intellectual legacy =The History of British India= Mill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the empirical one common at the time. His best known literary work is his History of British India, in which he describes the acquisition of the Indian Empire by England and later the United Kingdom. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the Hindu civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country. Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's History of India by notable economist Amartya Sen.Amartya Sen's address given to the Millennium Session of the Indian History Congress According to Thomas Trautmann, \\"James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) ‚Äì most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters ‚Äì is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism\\". In the chapter titled General Reflections in \\"Of the Hindus\\", Mill wrote \\"under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy\\". According to Mill, \\"the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality\\" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and \\"in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave\\". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were \\"dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society\\". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were \\"disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves\\". Both were \\"cowardly and unfeeling\\". Both were \\"in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others\\". And both were \\"in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses\\".Dharampal, The Beautiful Tree. =British politics= Mill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called \\"philosophic radicalism\\". His writings on government and his personal influence among the Liberal politicians of his time determined the change of view from the French Revolution theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the Reform Bill was fought and won. His Elements of Political Economy followed up the views of his friend David Ricardo. By 1911, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described it as being of mainly historical interest, \\"an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded\\". Among the more important of its theses are: # that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. ¬ß 2, art. 3) # that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and # that what is now known as the \\"unearned increment\\" of land is a proper object for taxation. =Other areas= By his Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind and his Fragment on Mackintosh Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the Scottish Enlightenment, as then represented by Thomas Reid, Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, but made a new start, due in part to David Hartley, and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the Analysis is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on Franz Brentano who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology.Franz Brentano: Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt. Ed. Oskar Kraus, 2 vols. Leipzig: Meiner, 1924‚Äì25; ed. Mauro Antonelli. Heusenstamm: Ontos, 2008 The Fragment on Mackintosh severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir James Mackintosh's Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.

Discrepancies (including date of birth, details of his upbringing, and personal background) exist between the characters, leading most to consider this an early version, and not necessarily the Zuckerman around whom subsequent novels would revolve. In later books, Roth uses Zuckerman as a protagonist, starting with the 1979 novel The Ghost Writer, where he is a writing apprentice on a pilgrimage to cull the wisdom of the reclusive author E. I. Lonoff. In Zuckerman Unbound (1981), he has become established as a novelist and must deal with the fall-out from his ribald comedic novel Carnovsky.

Roth mined such meta-fictional concerns more deeply in his series of novels published in the 1980s, most radically in The Counterlife and Operation Shylock. By the mid-1990s, though, Roth tamped down on the self- referentiality. He reintroduced Zuckerman as witness and narrator in a trilogy of historical novels: American Pastoral (1997), I Married a Communist (1998), and The Human Stain (2000), set in the period from the 1960s into the 1990s.

The collision between Earth and an asteroid a few kilometres in diameter would release as much energy as the simultaneous detonation of several million nuclear weapons. Asteroid impact avoidance comprises a number of methods by which near-Earth objects (NEO) could be diverted, preventing destructive impact events. A sufficiently large impact by an asteroid or other NEOs would cause, depending on its impact location, massive tsunamis or multiple firestorms, and an impact winter caused by the sunlight-blocking effect of placing large quantities of pulverized rock dust, and other debris, into the stratosphere. A collision 66 million years ago between the Earth and an object approximately wide is thought to have produced the Chicxulub crater and the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, widely held responsible for the extinction of most dinosaurs. While the chances of a major collision are low in the near term, there is a certainty that one will happen eventually unless defensive measures are taken. Astronomical events‚Äîsuch as the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts on Jupiter and the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, along with the growing number of objects on the Sentry Risk Table‚Äîhave drawn renewed attention to such threats. In 2016, a NASA scientist warned that the Earth is unprepared for such an event.Earth woefully unprepared for surprise comet or asteroid, Nasa scientist warns The Guardian In April 2018, the B612 Foundation reported \\"It's 100 percent certain we'll be hit [by a devastating asteroid], but we're not 100 percent sure when.\\" Also in 2018, physicist Stephen Hawking, in his final book Brief Answers to the Big Questions, considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet. Several ways of avoiding an asteroid impact have been described. Nonetheless, in March 2019, scientists reported that asteroids may be much more difficult to destroy than thought earlier. In addition, an asteroid may reassemble itself due to gravity after being disrupted.  Deflection efforts  Known Near-Earth objects as of January 2018 Video (0:55; July 23, 2018) (Earth's orbit in white) According to expert testimony in the United States Congress in 2013, NASA would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched. In June 2018, the US National Science and Technology Council warned that America is unprepared for an asteroid impact event, and developed and released the \\"National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan\\" to better prepare. Most deflection efforts for a large object require from a year to decades of warning, allowing time to prepare and carry out a collision avoidance project, as no known planetary defense hardware has yet been developed. It has been estimated that a velocity change of just (where t is the number of years until potential impact) is needed to successfully deflect a body on a direct collision trajectory. In addition, under certain circumstances, much smaller velocity changes are needed.S.-Y. Park and I. M. Ross, \\"Two-Body Optimization for Deflecting Earth-Crossing Asteroids,\\" Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics, Vol. 22, No.3, 1999, pp.415‚Äì420. For example, it was estimated there was a high chance of 99942 Apophis swinging by Earth in 2029 with a 10‚àí4 probability of passing through a 'keyhole' and returning on an impact trajectory in 2035 or 2036. It was then determined that a deflection from this potential return trajectory, several years before the swing-by, could be achieved with a velocity change on the order of 10‚àí6 ms‚àí1.Lu, Edward T. and Stanley G. Love. A Gravitational Tractor for Towing Asteroids, NASA, Johnson Space Center, submitted to arxiv.org September 20, 2005. (PDF document ). An impact by a asteroid on the Earth has historically caused an extinction-level event due to catastrophic damage to the biosphere. There is also the threat from comets entering the inner Solar System. The impact speed of a long-period comet would likely be several times greater than that of a near-Earth asteroid, making its impact much more destructive; in addition, the warning time is unlikely to be more than a few months., p. 12. Impacts from objects as small as in diameter, which are far more common, are historically extremely destructive regionally (see Barringer crater). Finding out the material composition of the object is also helpful before deciding which strategy is appropriate. Missions like the 2005 Deep Impact probe have provided valuable information on what to expect. Frequency of small asteroids roughly 1 to 20 meters in diameter impacting Earth's atmosphere. = History of government mandates = Efforts in asteroid impact prediction have concentrated on the survey method. The 1992 NASA-sponsored Near-Earth-Object Interception Workshop hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory evaluated issues involved in intercepting celestial objects that could hit Earth. In a 1992 report to NASA,Morrison, D., 25 January 1992, The Spaceguard Survey: Report of the NASA International Near-Earth-Object Detection Workshop , NASA, Washington, D.C. a coordinated Spaceguard Survey was recommended to discover, verify and provide follow-up observations for Earth-crossing asteroids. This survey was expected to discover 90% of these objects larger than one kilometer within 25 years. Three years later, another NASA reportShoemaker, E.M., 1995, Report of the Near-Earth Objects Survey Working Group, NASA Office of Space Science, Solar System Exploration Office recommended search surveys that would discover 60‚Äì70% of short-period, near-Earth objects larger than one kilometer within ten years and obtain 90% completeness within five more years. In 1998, NASA formally embraced the goal of finding and cataloging, by 2008, 90% of all near-Earth objects (NEOs) with diameters of 1 km or larger that could represent a collision risk to Earth. The 1 km diameter metric was chosen after considerable study indicated that an impact of an object smaller than 1 km could cause significant local or regional damage but is unlikely to cause a worldwide catastrophe. The impact of an object much larger than 1 km diameter could well result in worldwide damage up to, and potentially including, extinction of the human species. The NASA commitment has resulted in the funding of a number of NEO search efforts, which made considerable progress toward the 90% goal by 2008. However the 2009 discovery of several NEOs approximately 2 to 3 kilometers in diameter (e.g. , , , and ) demonstrated there were still large objects to be detected. United States Representative George E. Brown, Jr. (D-CA) was quoted as voicing his support for planetary defense projects in Air & Space Power Chronicles, saying \\"If some day in the future we discover well in advance that an asteroid that is big enough to cause a mass extinction is going to hit the Earth, and then we alter the course of that asteroid so that it does not hit us, it will be one of the most important accomplishments in all of human history.\\" Because of Congressman Brown's long-standing commitment to planetary defense, a U.S. House of Representatives' bill, H.R. 1022, was named in his honor: The George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act. This bill \\"to provide for a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize certain near-Earth asteroids and comets\\" was introduced in March 2005 by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA).National Academy of Sciences. 2010. Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies: Final Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. Available at: . It was eventually rolled into S.1281, the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, passed by Congress on December 22, 2005, subsequently signed by the President, and stating in part: > The U.S. Congress has declared that the general welfare and security of the > United States require that the unique competence of NASA be directed to > detecting, tracking, cataloguing, and characterizing near-Earth asteroids > and comets in order to provide warning and mitigation of the potential > hazard of such near-Earth objects to the Earth.

NEOWISE first four years of data starting in December 2013 (animated; April 20, 2018) The Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts has been cataloging the orbits of asteroids and comets since 1947. It has recently been joined by surveys that specialize in locating the near-Earth objects (NEO), many (as of early 2007) funded by NASA's Near Earth Object program office as part of their Spaceguard program. One of the best-known is LINEAR that began in 1996. By 2004 LINEAR was discovering tens of thousands of objects each year and accounting for 65% of all new asteroid detections. LINEAR uses two one-meter telescopes and one half-meter telescope based in New Mexico. The Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) is conducted at the Steward Observatory's Catalina Station, located near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. It uses two telescopes, a 1.5-meter (60-inch) f/2 telescope on the peak of Mount Lemmon, and a 68-cm (27-inch) f/1.7 Schmidt telescope near Mount Bigelow (both in the Tucson, Arizona area). In 2005, CSS became the most prolific NEO survey surpassing Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) in total number of NEOs and potentially hazardous asteroids discovered each year since. CSS discovered 310 NEOs in 2005, 396 in 2006, 466 in 2007, and in 2008 564 NEOs were found.NEO discovery statistics from JPL. Shows the number of asteroids of various types (potentially hazardous, size > 1 km, etc.) that different programs have discovered, by year. Spacewatch, which uses a 90 centimeter telescope sited at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, updated with automatic pointing, imaging, and analysis equipment to search the skies for intruders, was set up in 1980 by Tom Gehrels and Robert S. McMillan of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona in Tucson, and is now being operated by McMillan. The Spacewatch project has acquired a 1.8 meter telescope, also at Kitt Peak, to hunt for NEOs, and has provided the old 90 centimeter telescope with an improved electronic imaging system with much greater resolution, improving its search capability. Other near-Earth object tracking programs include Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT), Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS), Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey (CINEOS), Japanese Spaceguard Association, and Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey. Pan-STARRS completed telescope construction in 2010, and it is now actively observing. The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, now in operation, conducts frequent scans of the sky with a view to later-stage detection on the collision stretch of the asteroid orbit. Those would be much too late for deflection, but still in time for evacuation and preparation of the affected Earth region. Another project, supported by the European Union, is NEOShield, which analyses realistic options for preventing the collision of a NEO with Earth. Their aim is to provide test mission designs for feasible NEO mitigation concepts. The project particularly emphasises on two aspects. # The first one is the focus on technological development on essential techniques and instruments needed for guidance, navigation and control (GNC) in close vicinity of asteroids and comets. This will, for example, allow hitting such bodies with a high-velocity kinetic impactor spacecraft and observing them before, during and after a mitigation attempt, e.g., for orbit determination and monitoring. # The second one focuses on refining Near Earth Object (NEO) characterisation. Moreover, NEOShield-2 will carry out astronomical observations of NEOs, to improve the understanding of their physical properties, concentrating on the smaller sizes of most concern for mitigation purposes, and to identify further objects suitable for missions for physical characterisation and NEO deflection demonstration. \\"Spaceguard\\" is the name for these loosely affiliated programs, some of which receive NASA funding to meet a U.S. Congressional requirement to detect 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 1 km diameter by 2008. A 2003 NASA study of a follow-on program suggests spending US$250‚Äì450 million to detect 90% of all near-Earth asteroids 140 meters and larger by 2028. NEODyS is an online database of known NEOs.  Sentinel Mission  The B612 Foundation is a private nonprofit foundation with headquarters in the United States, dedicated to protecting the Earth from asteroid strikes. It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Southwest Research Institute, Stanford University, NASA and the space industry. As a non-governmental organization it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. The foundation's current goal is to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space telescope, Sentinel, to be launched in 2017‚Äì2018. The Sentinel's infrared telescope, once parked in an orbit similar to that of Venus, will help identify threatening NEOs by cataloging 90% of those with diameters larger than , as well as surveying smaller Solar System objects.Powell, Corey S. \\"Developing Early Warning Systems for Killer Asteroids\\" , Discover, August 14, 2013, pp. 60‚Äì61 (subscription required). Data gathered by Sentinel will help identify asteroids and other NEOs that pose a risk of collision with Earth, by being forwarded to scientific data- sharing networks, including NASA and academic institutions such as the Minor Planet Center.Broad, William J.

However, on July 23, 2013, the orbit@home project was selected for funding by NASA's Near Earth Object Observation program and was to resume operations sometime in early 2014. As of July 13, 2018, the project is offline according to its website. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, currently under construction, is expected to perform a comprehensive, high-resolution survey starting in the early 2020s. =Detection from space= On November 8, 2007, the House Committee on Science and Technology's Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing to examine the status of NASA's Near-Earth Object survey program. The prospect of using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer was proposed by NASA officials.Hearing Charter: Near-Earth Objects: Status of the Survey Program and Review of NASA's 2007 Report to Congress  SpaceRef Canada ‚Äì Your Daily Source of Canadian Space News WISE surveyed the sky in the infrared band at a very high sensitivity. Asteroids that absorb solar radiation can be observed through the infrared band. It was used to detect NEOs, in addition to performing its science goals. It is projected that WISE could detect 400 NEOs (roughly two percent of the estimated NEO population of interest) within the one-year mission. NEOSSat, the Near Earth Object Surveillance Satellite, is a microsatellite launched in February 2013 by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) that will hunt for NEOs in space. Furthermore Near-Earth Object WISE (NEOWISE), an extension of the WISE mission, started in September 2013 (in its second mission extension) to hunt asteroids and comets close to the orbit of Earth.https://hackaday.com/2020/07/22/the-wise-in-neowise-how-a-hibernating- satellite-awoke-to-discover-the-comet/ = Deep Impact = Research published in the March 26, 2009 issue of the journal Nature, describes how scientists were able to identify an asteroid in space before it entered Earth's atmosphere, enabling computers to determine its area of origin in the Solar System as well as predict the arrival time and location on Earth of its shattered surviving parts. The four-meter-diameter asteroid, called 2008 TC3, was initially sighted by the automated Catalina Sky Survey telescope, on October 6, 2008. Computations correctly predicted that it would impact 19 hours after discovery and in the Nubian Desert of northern Sudan.We Saw It Coming: Asteroid Monitored from Outer Space to Ground Impact Newswise, Retrieved on March 26, 2009. A number of potential threats have been identified, such as 99942 Apophis (previously known by its provisional designation ), which in 2004 temporarily had an impact probability of about 3% for the year 2029. Additional observations revised this probability down to zero.Predicting Apophis' Earth Encounters in 2029 and 2036  Impact probability calculation pattern  Why asteroid impact probability often goes up, then down. The ellipses in the diagram on the right show the predicted position of an example asteroid at closest Earth approach. At first, with only a few asteroid observations, the error ellipse is very large and includes the Earth. Further observations shrink the error ellipse, but it still includes the Earth. This raises the predicted impact probability, since the Earth now covers a larger fraction of the error region. Finally, yet more observations (often radar observations, or discovery of a previous sighting of the same asteroid on archival images) shrink the ellipse revealing that the Earth is outside the error region, and the impact probability is near zero. (Original Site is no longer available, see Archived Site at ) For asteroids that are actually on track to hit Earth the predicted probability of impact continues to increase as more observations are made. This similar pattern makes it difficult to differentiate between asteroids that will only come close to Earth and those that will actually hit it. This in turn makes it difficult to decide when to raise an alarm as gaining more certainty takes time, which reduces time available to react to a predicted impact. However raising the alarm too soon has the danger of causing a false alarm and creating a Boy Who Cried Wolf effect if the asteroid in fact misses Earth.  Collision avoidance strategies  Various collision avoidance techniques have different trade-offs with respect to metrics such as overall performance, cost, failure risks, operations, and technology readiness. There are various methods for changing the course of an asteroid/comet.C. D. Hall and I. M. Ross, \\"Dynamics and Control Problems in the Deflection of Near-Earth Objects,\\" Advances in the Astronautical Sciences, Astrodynamics 1997, Vol.97, Part I, 1997, pp.613‚Äì631. These can be differentiated by various types of attributes such as the type of mitigation (deflection or fragmentation), energy source (kinetic, electromagnetic, gravitational, solar/thermal, or nuclear), and approach strategy (interception,Solem, J. C.; Snell, C. (1994). \\"Terminal intercept for less than one orbital period warning \\", a chapter in Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids, Geherels, T., ed. (University of Arizona Press, Tucson), pp. 1013‚Äì1034. rendezvous, or remote station). Strategies fall into two basic sets: Fragmentation and delay. Fragmentation concentrates on rendering the impactor harmless by fragmenting it and scattering the fragments so that they miss the Earth or are small enough to burn up in the atmosphere. Delay exploits the fact that both the Earth and the impactor are in orbit. An impact occurs when both reach the same point in space at the same time, or more correctly when some point on Earth's surface intersects the impactor's orbit when the impactor arrives. Since the Earth is approximately 12,750 km in diameter and moves at approx. 30 km per second in its orbit, it travels a distance of one planetary diameter in about 425 seconds, or slightly over seven minutes. Delaying, or advancing the impactor's arrival by times of this magnitude can, depending on the exact geometry of the impact, cause it to miss the Earth. Collision avoidance strategies can also be seen as either direct, or indirect and in how rapidly they transfer energy to the object. The direct methods, such as nuclear explosives, or kinetic impactors, rapidly intercept the bolide's path. Direct methods are preferred because they are generally less costly in time and money. Their effects may be immediate, thus saving precious time. These methods would work for short-notice and long-notice threats, and are most effective against solid objects that can be directly pushed, but in the case of kinetic impactors, they are not very effective against large loosely aggregated rubble piles. Indirect methods, such as gravity tractors, attaching rockets or mass drivers, are much slower. They require traveling to the object, changing course up to 180 degrees for space rendezvous, and then taking much more time to change the asteroid's path just enough so it will miss Earth. Many NEOs are thought to be \\"flying rubble piles\\" only loosely held together by gravity, and a typical spacecraft sized kinetic-impactor deflection attempt might just break up the object or fragment it without sufficiently adjusting its course.Planetary Defense Conference 2007, Washington D.C.

Tracking the thousands of buckshot-like fragments that could result from such an explosion would be a very daunting task, although fragmentation would be preferable to doing nothing and allowing the originally larger rubble body, which is analogous to a shot and wax slug, to impact the Earth. In Cielo simulations conducted in 2011‚Äì2012, in which the rate and quantity of energy delivery were sufficiently high and matched to the size of the rubble pile, such as following a tailored nuclear explosion, results indicated that any asteroid fragments, created after the pulse of energy is delivered, would not pose a threat of re-coalescing (including for those with the shape of asteroid Itokawa) but instead would rapidly achieve escape velocity from their parent body (which for Itokawa is about 0.2 m/s) and therefore move out of an earth- impact trajectory.Further RAGE modeling of Asteroid mitigation, surface and subsurface explosions in porous objects. Weaver et al. 2011 = Nuclear explosive device = In a similar manner to the earlier pipes filled with a partial pressure of helium, as used in the Ivy Mike test of 1952, the 1954 Castle Bravo test was likewise heavily instrumented with line-of-sight (LOS) pipes, to better define and quantify the timing and energies of the x-rays and neutrons produced by these early thermonuclear devices.Operation CASTLE Commander's Report 4:00Declassified U.S. Nuclear Test Film #34 0800034 ‚Äì Project Gnome ‚Äì 1961 One of the outcomes of this diagnostic work resulted in this graphic depiction of the transport of energetic x-ray and neutrons through a vacuum line, some 2.3 km long, whereupon it heated solid matter at the \\"station 1200\\" blockhouse and thus generated a secondary fireball.Los Alamos Science No. 28, 2003 Initiating a nuclear explosive device above, on, or slightly beneath, the surface of a threatening celestial body is a potential deflection option, with the optimal detonation height dependent upon the composition and size of the object.Solem, J. C. (1995). \\"Interception and disruption\\", in Proceedings of Planetary Defense Workshop, Livermore, CA, May 22‚Äì26, 1995, CONF-9505266 (LLNL, Livermore, CA), pp. 219‚Äì228 (236‚Äì246). It does not require the entire NEO to be vaporized to mitigate an impact threat. In the case of an inbound threat from a \\"rubble pile,\\" the stand off, or detonation height above the surface configuration, has been put forth as a means to prevent the potential fracturing of the rubble pile. The energetic neutrons and soft X-rays released by the detonation, which do not appreciably penetrate matter, are converted into thermal heat upon encountering the object's surface matter, ablatively vaporizing all line of sight exposed surface areas of the object to a shallow depth, turning the surface material it heats up into ejecta, and, analogous to the ejecta from a chemical rocket engine exhaust, changing the velocity, or \\"nudging\\", the object off course by the reaction, following Newton's third law, with ejecta going one way and the object being propelled in the other. Depending on the energy of the explosive device, the resulting rocket exhaust effect, created by the high velocity of the asteroid's vaporized mass ejecta, coupled with the object's small reduction in mass, would produce enough of a change in the object's orbit to make it miss the Earth. A Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER) has been proposed. Stand-off approach If the object is very large but is still a loosely- held-together rubble pile, a solution is to detonate one or a series of nuclear explosive devices alongside the asteroid, at a or greater stand-off height above its surface, so as not to fracture the potentially loosely-held- together object. Providing that this stand-off strategy was done far enough in advance, the force from a sufficient number of nuclear blasts would alter the object's trajectory enough to avoid an impact, according to computer simulations and experimental evidence from meteorites exposed to the thermal X-ray pulses of the Z-machine.How to Stop a Killer Asteroid When a civilization-ending space rock bears down on us, this nuclear option might just save our species. 2015 In 1967, graduate students under Professor Paul Sandorff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were tasked with designing a method to prevent a hypothetical 18-month distant impact on Earth by the asteroid 1566 Icarus, an object that makes regular close approaches to Earth, sometimes as close as 16 lunar distances. To achieve the task within the timeframe and with limited material knowledge of the asteroid's composition, a variable stand-off system was conceived. This would have used a number of modified Saturn V rockets sent on interception courses and the creation of a handful of nuclear explosive devices in the 100-megaton energy range‚Äîcoincidentally, the same as the maximum yield of the Soviets' Tsar Bomba would have been if a uranium tamper had been used‚Äîas each rocket vehicle's payload.\\"Systems Engineering: Avoiding an Asteroid\\" , Time Magazine, June 16, 1967.Day, Dwayne A., \\"Giant bombs on giant rockets: Project Icarus\\" , The Space Review, Monday, July 5, 2004 The design study was later published as Project IcarusKleiman Louis A., Project Icarus: an MIT Student Project in Systems Engineering , Cambridge, Massachusetts : MIT Press, 1968 which served as the inspiration for the 1979 film Meteor.'Project Icarus \\"MIT Course precept for movie\\" , The Tech, MIT, October 30, 1979 A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated: > Nuclear standoff explosions are assessed to be 10‚Äì100 times more effective > than the non-nuclear alternatives analyzed in this study.

Near-Earth Object Survey > and Deflection Analysis of Alternatives Report to Congress March 2007 In the same year, NASA released a study where the asteroid Apophis (with a diameter of around ) was assumed to have a much lower rubble pile density () and therefore lower mass than it is now known to have, and in the study, it is assumed to be on an impact trajectory with Earth for the year 2029. Under these hypothetical conditions, the report determines that a \\"Cradle spacecraft\\" would be sufficient to deflect it from Earth impact. This conceptual spacecraft contains six B83 physics packages, each set for their maximum 1.2-megatonne yield, bundled together and lofted by an Ares V vehicle sometime in the 2020s, with each B83 being fuzed to detonate over the asteroid's surface at a height of (\\"1/3 of the objects diameter\\" as its stand- off), one after the other, with hour-long intervals between each detonation. The results of this study indicated that a single employment of this option \\"can deflect NEOs of [ diameter] two years before impact, and larger NEOs with at least five years warning\\".Near Earth Object (NEO) Mitigation Options Using Exploration Technologies These effectiveness figures are considered to be \\"conservative\\" by its authors, and only the thermal X-ray output of the B83 devices was considered, while neutron heating was neglected for ease of calculation purposes.Towards Designing an Integrated Architecture for NEO Characterization, Mitigation, Scientific Evaluation, and Resource Utilization Surface and subsurface use This early Asteroid Redirect Mission artist's impression is suggestive of another method of changing a large threatening celestial body's orbit by capturing relatively smaller celestial objects and using those, and not the usually proposed small bits of spacecraft, as the means of creating a powerful kinetic impact, or alternatively, a stronger faster acting gravitational tractor, as some low- density asteroids such as 253 Mathilde can dissipate impact energy. In 2011, the director of the Asteroid Deflection Research Center at Iowa State University, Wie (who had published kinetic impactor deflection studies previously), began to study strategies that could deal with objects when the time to Earth impact was less than one year. He concluded that to provide the required energy, a nuclear explosion or other event that could deliver the same power, are the only methods that can work against a very large asteroid within these time constraints. This work resulted in the creation of a conceptual Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV), which combines a kinetic impactor to create an initial crater for a follow-up subsurface nuclear detonation within that initial crater, which would generate a high degree of efficiency in the conversion of the nuclear energy that is released in the detonation into propulsion energy to the asteroid. Nuking Dangerous Asteroids Might Be the Best Protection, Expert Says. Includes a supercomputer simulation video provided by Los Alamos National Laboratory. A similar proposal would use a surface-detonating nuclear device in place of the kinetic impactor to create the initial crater, then using the crater as a rocket nozzle to channel succeeding nuclear detonations. At the 2014 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) conference, Wie and his colleagues stated that \\"we have the solution, using our baseline concept, to be able to mitigate the asteroid-impact threat, with any range of warning.\\" For example, according to their computer models, with a warning time of 30 days, a asteroid would be neutralized by using a single HAIV, with less than 0.1% of the destroyed object's mass potentially striking Earth, which by comparison would be more than acceptable.An Innovative Solution to NASA's NEO Impact Threat Mitigation Grand Challenge and Flight Validation Mission Architecture Development, 2014 As of 2015, Wie has collaborated with the Danish Emergency Asteroid Defence Project (EADP),EADP partners which ultimately intends to crowdsource sufficient funds to design, build, and store a non-nuclear HAIV spacecraft as planetary insurance. For threatening asteroids too large and/or too close to Earth impact to effectively be deflected by the non-nuclear HAIV approach, nuclear explosive devices (with 5% of the explosive yield than those used for the stand-off strategy) are intended to be swapped in, under international oversight, when conditions arise that necessitate it.Asteroid Defence, Emergency Asteroid Defence Project Comet deflection possibility Following the 1994 Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet impacts with Jupiter, Edward Teller proposed, to a collective of U.S. and Russian ex-Cold War weapons designers in a 1995 planetary defense workshop meeting at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), that they collaborate to design a one-gigaton nuclear explosive device, which would be equivalent to the kinetic energy of a asteroid.Planetary defense workshop LLNL 1995A new use for nuclear weapons: hunting rogue asteroids A persistent campaign by weapons designers to develop a nuclear defense against extraterrestrial rocks slowly wins government support 2013 The theoretical one-gigaton device would weigh about 25‚Äì30 tons, light enough to be lifted on the Energia rocket. It could be used to instantaneously vaporize a asteroid, divert the paths of extinction event class asteroids (greater than in diameter) within short notice of a few months. With one year of notice, and at an interception location no closer than Jupiter, it could also deal with the even rarer short period comets that can come out of the Kuiper belt and transit past Earth orbit within two years. For comets of this class, with a maximum estimated diameter of , Charon served as the hypothetical threat. In 2013, the related National Laboratories of the US and Russia signed a deal that includes an intent to cooperate on defense from asteroids.United States, Russia Sign Agreement to Further Research and Development Collaboration in Nuclear Energy and Security Present capability An April 2014 GAO report notes that the NNSA is retaining canned subassemblies (CSAs) \\" in an indeterminate state pending a senior-level government evaluation of their use in planetary defense against earthbound asteroids.\\" In its FY2015 budget request, the NNSA noted that the nine-megaton B53 component disassembly was \\"delayed\\", leading some observers to conclude they might be the warhead CSAs being retained for potential planetary defense purposes. Law The use of nuclear explosive devices is an international issue and will need to be addressed by the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty technically bans nuclear weapons in space. However, it is unlikely that a nuclear explosive device, fuzed to be detonated only upon interception with a threatening celestial object, Nuking Dangerous Asteroids Might Be the Best Protection, Expert Says. Includes a supercomputer simulation video provided by Los Alamos National Laboratory. Wie admitted that sending nuclear weapons into space would be politically controversial. However, he said there are a number of safety features that could be built into the spacecraft to prevent the nuclear warhead from detonating in the event of a launch failure. with the sole intent of preventing that celestial body from impacting Earth would be regarded as an un-peaceful use of space, or that the explosive device sent to mitigate an Earth impact, explicitly designed to prevent harm to come to life, would fall under the classification of a \\"weapon\\".John Remo, the dilemma if nuclear energy in space, 2015 = Kinetic impact = The 2005 Deep Impact collision with the comet Tempel 1.Chapter 10 ‚Äì Comets Astronomy 9601 The impact flash and resulting ejecta are clearly visible.

An object with a high mass close to the Earth could be sent out into a collision course with the asteroid, knocking it off course. When the asteroid is still far from the Earth, a means of deflecting the asteroid is to directly alter its momentum by colliding a spacecraft with the asteroid. A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated: > Non-nuclear kinetic impactors are the most mature approach and could be used > in some deflection/mitigation scenarios, especially for NEOs that consist of > a single small, solid body. The European Space Agency (ESA) is studying the preliminary design of two space missions for ~2020, named AIDA (formerly Don Quijote), and if flown, they would be the first intentional asteroid deflection mission. ESA's Advanced Concepts Team has also demonstrated theoretically that a deflection of 99942 Apophis could be achieved by sending a simple spacecraft weighing less than one ton to impact against the asteroid. During a trade-off study one of the leading researchers argued that a strategy called 'kinetic impactor deflection' was more efficient than others. The European Union's NEOShield-2 Mission is also primarily studying the Kinetic Impactor mitigation method. The principle of the kinetic impactor mitigation method is that the NEO or Asteroid is deflected following an impact from an impactor spacecraft. The principle of momentum transfer is used, as the impactor crashes into the NEO at a very high velocity of or more. The momentum of the impactor is transferred to the NEO, causing a change in velocity and therefore making it deviate from its course slightly. As of mid-2018, the AIDA mission has been partly approved. The NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) kinetic impactor spacecraft has entered phase C (detailed definition). The goal is to impact the asteroidal moon of near-Earth Asteroid 65803 Didymos, nicknamed Didymoon. The impact will occur in October 2022 when Didymos is relatively close to Earth, allowing Earth-based telescopes and planetary radar to observe the event. The result of the impact will be to change the orbital velocity and hence orbital period of Didymoon, by a large enough amount that it can be measured from Earth. This will show for the first time that it is possible to change the orbit of a small asteroid, around the size most likely to require active mitigation in the future. The second part of the AIDA missionthe ESA HERA spacecrafthas entered phase B (Preliminary Definition) and requires approval by ESA member states in October 2019. If approved, it would reach the Didymos system in 2024 and measure both the mass of Didymoon and the precise effect of the impact on that body, allowing much better extrapolation of the AIDA mission to other targets. = Asteroid gravity tractor = Another alternative to explosive deflection is to move the asteroid slowly over time. A small but constant amount of thrust accumulates to deviate an object sufficiently from its course. Edward T. Lu and Stanley G. Love have proposed using a massive unmanned spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the asteroid into a non-threatening orbit. Though both objects are gravitationally pulled towards each other, the spacecraft can counter the force towards the asteroid by, for example, an ion thruster, so the net effect would be that the asteroid is accelerated towards the spacecraft and thus slightly deflected from its orbit. While slow, this method has the advantage of working irrespective of the asteroid's composition or spin rate; rubble pile asteroids would be difficult to deflect by means of nuclear detonations, while a pushing device would be hard or inefficient to mount on a fast-rotating asteroid. A gravity tractor would likely have to spend several years beside the asteroid to be effective. A NASA analysis of deflection alternatives, conducted in 2007, stated: > \\"Slow push\\" mitigation techniques are the most expensive, have the lowest > level of technical readiness, and their ability to both travel to and divert > a threatening NEO would be limited unless mission durations of many years to > decades are possible. = Ion beam shepherd = Another \\"contactless\\" asteroid deflection technique has been proposed by C.Bombardelli and J.Pel√°ez from the Technical University of Madrid. The method involves the use of a low-divergence ion thruster pointed at the asteroid from a nearby hovering spacecraft. The momentum transmitted by the ions reaching the asteroid surface produces a slow-but- continuous force that can deflect the asteroid in a similar way as the gravity tractor, but with a lighter spacecraft. = Focused solar energy = H. J. Melosh with I.V. Nemchinov proposed deflecting an asteroid or comet by focusing solar energy onto its surface to create thrust from the resulting vaporization of material. This method would first require the construction of a space station with a system of large collecting, concave mirrors similar to those used in solar furnaces. Orbit mitigation with highly concentrated sunlight is scalable to achieving the predetermined deflection within a year even for a global-threatening body without prolonged warning time. Such a hastened strategy may become topical in the case of late detection of a potential hazard, and also, if required, in providing the possibility for some additional action. Conventional concave reflectors are practically inapplicable to the high-concentrating geometry in the case of a giant shadowing space target, which is located in front of the mirrored surface. This is primarily because of the dramatic spread of the mirrors' focal points on the target due to the optical aberration when the optical axis is not aligned with the Sun. On the other hand, the positioning of any collector at a distance to the target much larger than its size does not yield the required concentration level (and therefore temperature) due to the natural divergence of the sunrays. Such principal restrictions are inevitably at any location regarding the asteroid of one or many unshaded forward-reflecting collectors. Also, in the case of secondary mirrors use, similar to the ones found in Cassegrain telescopes, would be prone to heat damage by partially concentrated sunlight from primary mirror. In order to remove the above restrictions, V.P. Vasylyev proposed to apply an alternative design of a mirrored collector ‚Äì the ring-array concentrator. This type of collector has an underside lens-like position of its focal area that avoids shadowing of the collector by the target and minimizes the risk of its coating by ejected debris. Provided the sunlight concentration ~ 5 √ó 103 times, a surface irradiance of around 4-5 MW/m2 leads to a thrusting effect ~ 103 N. Intensive ablation of the rotating asteroid surface under the focal spot will lead to the appearance of a deep \\"canyon\\", which can contribute to the formation of the escaping gas flow into a jet-like one. This may be sufficient to deflect a 0.5-km asteroid within several months and no addition warning period, only using ring-array collector size ~ 0.5 of asteroid diameter. For such a prompt deflection of the larger NEOs, 1.3-2.2 km, the required collector sizes are comparable to the target diameter. In the case of a longer warning time, the required size of the collector may be significantly decreased. Artist's impression of asteroid deflection using an innovative ring-array solar collector. = Mass driver = A mass driver is an (automated) system on the asteroid to eject material into space thus giving the object a slow steady push and decreasing its mass. A mass driver is designed to work as a very low specific impulse system, which in general uses a lot of propellant, but very little power. The idea is that when using local material as propellant, the amount of propellant is not as important as the amount of power, which is likely to be limited. = Conventional rocket engine = Attaching any spacecraft propulsion device would have a similar effect of giving a push, possibly forcing the asteroid onto a trajectory that takes it away from Earth. An in-space rocket engine that is capable of imparting an impulse of 106 N¬∑s (E.g. adding 1 km/s to a 1000 kg vehicle), will have a relatively small effect on a relatively small asteroid that has a mass of roughly a million times more.

Such direct force rocket engines are typically proposed to use highly-efficient electrically powered spacecraft propulsion, such as ion thrusters or VASIMR. = Asteroid laser ablation = Similar to the effects of a nuclear device, it is thought possible to focus sufficient laser energy on the surface of an asteroid to cause flash vaporization / ablation to create either in impulse or to ablate away the asteroid mass. This concept, called asteroid laser ablation was articulated in the 1995 SpaceCast 2020 white paper \\"Preparing for Planetary Defense\\",http://www.nss.org:8080/resources/library/planetarydefense/1994-DetectionAndInterceptionOfAsteroidsOnCollisionCourseWithEarth.pdf and the 1996 Air Force 2025 white paper \\"Planetary Defense: Catastrophic Health Insurance for Planet Earth\\".http://www.nss.org:8080/resources/library/planetarydefense/1996-PlanetaryDefense- CatstrophicHealthInsuranceForPlanetEarth-Urias.pdf Early publications include C. R. Phipps \\"ORION\\" concept from 1996, Colonel Jonathan W. Campbell's 2000 monograph \\"Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection\\", and NASA's 2005 concept Comet Asteroid Protection System (CAPS). Typically such systems require a significant amount of power, such as would be available from a Space-Based Solar Power Satellite. Another proposal is the Phillip Lubin's DE-STAR proposal. * The DE-STAR project,Philip Lubin: A space-based array for planetary defense (video), SPIE Newsroom, 22 November 2013 proposed by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is a concept modular solar powered 1 ¬µm, near infrared wavelength, laser array. The design calls for the array to eventually be approximately 1 km squared in size, with the modular design meaning that it could be launched in increments and assembled in space. In its early stages as a small array it could deal with smaller targets, assist solar sail probes and would also be useful in cleaning up space debris. = Other proposals = NASA study of a solar sail. The sail would be wide. * Wrapping the asteroid in a sheet of reflective plastic such as aluminized PET film as a solar sail * \\"Painting\\" or dusting the object with titanium dioxide (white) to alter its trajectory via increased reflected radiation pressure or with soot (black) to alter its trajectory via the Yarkovsky effect. * Planetary scientist Eugene Shoemaker in 1996 proposed\\\\--in a lecture to the Arizona Geological Society in 12‚Äì96. deflecting a potential impactor by releasing a cloud of steam in the path of the object, hopefully gently slowing it.

Deflection technology concerns  Carl Sagan, in his book Pale Blue Dot, expressed concern about deflection technology, noting that any method capable of deflecting impactors away from Earth could also be abused to divert non-threatening bodies toward the planet. Considering the history of genocidal political leaders and the possibility of the bureaucratic obscuring of any such project's true goals to most of its scientific participants, he judged the Earth at greater risk from a man-made impact than a natural one. Sagan instead suggested that deflection technology be developed only in an actual emergency situation. All low-energy delivery deflection technologies have inherent fine control and steering capability, making it possible to add just the right amount of energy to steer an asteroid originally destined for a mere close approach toward a specific Earth target. According to former NASA astronaut Rusty Schweickart, the gravitational tractor method is controversial because, during the process of changing an asteroid's trajectory, the point on the Earth where it could most likely hit would be slowly shifted across different countries. Thus, the threat for the entire planet would be minimized at the cost of some specific states' security. In Schweickart's opinion, choosing the way the asteroid should be \\"dragged\\" would be a tough diplomatic decision. Analysis of the uncertainty involved in nuclear deflection shows that the ability to protect the planet does not imply the ability to target the planet. A nuclear explosion that changes an asteroid's velocity by 10 meters/second (plus or minus 20%) would be adequate to push it out of an Earth-impacting orbit. However, if the uncertainty of the velocity change was more than a few percent, there would be no chance of directing the asteroid to a particular target.

Cox noted the dangers of planetoid impacts, both those occurring naturally and those that might be brought about with hostile intent. They argued for cataloging the minor planets and developing the technologies to land on, deflect, or even capture planetoids. * In 1967, students in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at MIT did a design study, \\"Project Icarus,\\" of a mission to prevent a hypothetical impact on Earth by asteroid 1566 Icarus. The design project was later published in a book by the MIT Press and received considerable publicity, for the first time bringing asteroid impact into the public eye. * In the 1980s NASA studied evidence of past strikes on planet Earth, and the risk of this happening at the current level of civilization. This led to a program that maps objects in the Solar System that both cross Earth's orbit and are large enough to cause serious damage if they hit. * In the 1990s, US Congress held hearings to consider the risks and what needed to be done about them. This led to a US$3 million annual budget for programs like Spaceguard and the near-Earth object program, as managed by NASA and USAF. * In 2005 a number of astronauts published an open letter through the Association of Space Explorers calling for a united push to develop strategies to protect Earth from the risk of a cosmic collision. * It is currently (as of late 2007) estimated that there are approximately 20,000 objects capable of crossing Earth's orbit and large enough (140 meters or larger) to warrant concern. On the average, one of these will collide with Earth every 5,000 years, unless preventative measures are undertaken. It is now anticipated that by year 2008, 90% of such objects that are 1 km or more in diameter will have been identified and will be monitored. The further task of identifying and monitoring all such objects of 140m or greater is expected to be complete around 2020. * The Catalina Sky SurveyCatlalina Sky Survey website (CSS) is one of NASA¬¥s four funded surveys to carry out a 1998 U.S. Congress mandate to find and catalog by the end of 2008, at least 90 percent of all near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 1 kilometer across. CSS discovered over 1150 NEOs in years 2005 to 2007. In doing this survey they discovered on November 20, 2007, an asteroid, designated , which initially was estimated to have a chance of hitting Mars on January 30, 2008, but further observations during the following weeks allowed NASA to rule out an impact. NASA estimated a near miss by . * In January 2012, after a near pass-by of object 2012 BX34, a paper entitled \\"A Global Approach to Near-Earth Object Impact Threat Mitigation,\\" was released by researchers from Russia, Germany, the United States, France, Britain, and Spain, which discusses the \\"NEOShield\\" project.Leonard David.

He began tattooing in New York around the mid-1880s. O'Reilly's machine was based on the rotary technology of Thomas Edison's autographic printing pen. Although O'Reilly held the first patent for an electric tattoo machine, tattoo artists had been experimenting with and modifying a variety of different machines prior to the issuance of the patent. O'Reilly's first pre- patent tattoo machine was a modified dental plugger, which he used to tattoo several dime museum attractions for exhibition between the years 1889 and 1891. From the late 1880s on, tattoo machines continually evolved into the modern tattoo machine. O'Reilly first owned a shop at #5 Chatham Square on the New York Bowery. In 1904, he moved to #11 Chatham Square when the previous tenant, tattoo artist Elmer Getchell, left the city.

It was abolished under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. The Parliament of Northern Ireland was bicameral, consisting of a House of Commons with 52 seats, and an indirectly elected Senate with 26 seats. The Sovereign was represented by the Governor (initially by the Lord Lieutenant), who granted royal assent to Acts of Parliament in Northern Ireland, but executive power rested with the Prime Minister, the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons. House of Commons The House of Commons had 52 members, of which 48 were for territorial seats and four were for graduates of Queen's University, Belfast (until 1969, when the four university seats were replaced by an additional four territorial seats). The Government of Ireland Act prescribed that elections to the House of Commons should be by single transferable vote (STV), though the Parliament was given power to alter the electoral system from three years after its first meeting. The STV system was the subject of criticism from grassroots Unionists but because the three-year period ended during the Labour government of 1924, the Stormont government decided not to provoke the known egalitarian sympathies of many Labour backbenchers and held the second election on the same basis. The loss of eight Unionist seats in that election caused great acrimony and in 1929 the system was changed to first-past-the-post for all territorial constituencies, though STV was retained for the university seats. In the 1925 election however, Republicans also lost four seats and a substantial proportion of votes. Nationalists gained the same number of seats that Republicans had lost, but had only gained a small percentage of votes. It had been felt by some that Northern Ireland should use the same first-past-the-post system that was in place in the rest of the UK. By the time the first-past-the-post system was implemented for the 1929 election, the Republicans had few or no candidates and pro-separatist electors were represented almost solely by the Nationalist Party. Despite the change in the electoral system and accusations of gerrymandering, the Nationalist Party lost 9.5% share of the vote, but still gained a seat. The more moderate Northern Ireland Labour Party and Ulster Liberal Party both gained in vote share but lost seats. The boundary changes for 1929 were not made by an impartial boundary commission but by the Unionist government, for which it was accused of gerrymandering. The charges that the Stormont seats (as opposed to local council wards) were gerrymandered against Nationalists is disputed by historians (since the number of Nationalists elected under the two systems barely changed), though it is agreed that losses under the change to single-member constituency boundaries were suffered by independent unionists, the Liberals and the Northern Ireland Labour Party. Population movements were so small that these boundaries were used almost everywhere until the Parliament was dissolved in 1972. In 1968 the government abolished the Queen's University constituency (long after university constituencies had been abolished at Westminster) and created four new constituencies in the outskirts of Belfast where populations had grown. This change helped the Unionists, as they held only two of the University seats but won all four of the newly created seats. There had, however, long been calls from outside Unionism to abolish the graduate franchise (and other anomalies) and to have \\"one person one vote\\". Senate The Senate was a last-minute addition to the Parliament, after the original plans for a single Senate covering both the Stormont and Dublin Parliaments were overtaken by events. Twenty-four senators were elected by the House of Commons using the single transferable vote. The elections were carried out after each general election, with 12 members elected for two parliaments each time. The other two seats were held ex officio by the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Londonderry. The Senate generally had the same party balance as the House of Commons, though abstaining parties and very small parties were not represented. Because of this, and its dependence on the House of Commons for election, it had virtually no political impact. The Crown The British monarch was originally to have been represented in both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. However, the replacement of Southern Ireland by the Irish Free State led to the abolition of the post of Lord Lieutenant. Instead, a new office ‚Äì Governor of Northern Ireland ‚Äì was created on 12 December 1922. Location Initially the Parliament met in Belfast's City Hall but moved immediately to the Presbyterian Church's Assembly's College (later Union Theological College), where it remained during the period 1921‚Äì1932. The Commons met in the college's Gamble Library and the Senate in the chapel. In 1932, Parliament moved to the new purpose-built Parliament Buildings, designed by Sir Arnold Thornely, at Stormont, on the eastern outskirts of the city. \\"Stormont\\" came to be a synecdoche referring both to the Parliament itself and to the Northern Ireland government. Legislation Stormont was given power to legislate over almost all aspects of Northern Ireland life, with only a few matters excluded from its remit, the most important of which are: succession to the Crown, making of peace or war, armed forces, honours, naturalisation, some central taxes and postal services (a full list is in section 4 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920). The Parliament did not try to infringe the terms of the Government of Ireland Act; on only one occasion did the United Kingdom government advise the King to withhold royal assent. This was the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) which abolished proportional representation in local government elections; the issue was referred to London and royal assent was eventually given. The output of legislation was high for a devolved Parliament, though some of the Acts were adaptations of recently passed acts by the United Kingdom parliament. It was nominally prohibited by section 16 of the Schedule to the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 from making any law which directly or indirectly discriminated against a religion, although this provision had little effect. Brief history Robinson and Cleaver Department Store in Belfast, decorated for the State Opening of the first Northern Ireland parliament. 22 June 1921. The 1921 general election was explicitly fought on the issue of partition, being in effect a referendum on approval of the concept of a Northern Ireland administration. Thereafter, general election timing was up to the Prime Minister. Elections almost always took place at a time when the issue of partition had been raised in a new crisis. This generally guaranteed the loyalty of Protestant voters to the Unionist Party. Independent Unionist candidates and the Northern Ireland Labour Party were usually accused of being splitters or dupes of the Nationalists. The 1925 general election was called to tie in with the expected report of the Boundary Commission required by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922. The Boundary Commission was expected to recommend the transfer of many border areas to the Irish Free State, and the Unionist election slogan was \\"Not an Inch!\\". They lost eight seats in Belfast and County Antrim, where the issue of the border had far less resonance. Sinn F√©in had fought in 1921, but by 1925 was suffering the effects of its split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty. √âamon de Valera's Sinn F√©in fought as Republicans but won only two seats. The border was never changed. A minor row erupted in 1925 when the elections to the Senate took place. Eleven Unionists and one Labour Senator were elected, despite there being a block of three composed of two non-abstaining Nationalists and a dissident Unionist. The latter three had mailed their votes, but due to a public holiday and the practices of the postal service, they arrived an hour after the election. Requests for a recount were denied. (It is doubtful whether the three votes would have been sufficient to elect a Senator under the election system, since they would not have achieved a complete single transferable vote quota alone and the Unionist votes were likely to transfer so heavily to each other that the Nationalist candidate would not reach quota throughout the rounds of counting.) From later in 1925 to 1927, the Nationalist Party members took their seats for the first time. For the 1929 general election the Unionists replaced the proportional representation system blamed for their bad performance in 1925. The new boundaries set the pattern for politics until Stormont was abolished; the Unionists never fell below 33 seats. In the 1930s, the phrase \\"A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People\\" was a debated term. The 1938 general election was called when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Neville Chamberlain was negotiating a settlement of outstanding disputes with √âamon de Valera, whose new constitution laid claim to Northern Ireland, and the 1949 election was called when the Irish government declared itself a republic. During the Second World War, the Stormont government called on Westminster to introduce conscription several times, as this was already the case in Great Britain. The British government consistently refused, remembering how a similar attempt in 1918 had backfired dramatically, as nationalist opposition made it unworkable. Much of the population of serving age were either in essential jobs or had already joined up voluntarily, making the potential yield of conscription low. 1965 saw a significant change, in that the Nationalists accepted office as the Official Opposition. This was intended as a reward for the attempts made by Terence O'Neill to end discrimination against Catholics and normalise relations with the Republic. However, the Unionists split over O'Neill's tentative reforms at the 1969 general election and Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party began to win by-elections. The new nationalist party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, withdrew from Stormont in July 1971 over the refusal of an inquiry into Royal Ulster Constabulary actions in Derry. Stormont was abolished and Direct Rule from Westminster was introduced in March 1972, just six weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the Unionist government refused to hand over responsibility for law and order to Westminster. In its 50-year history, only one piece of legislation was passed that was introduced by a Nationalist member, the Wild Birds Protection Act. In October 1971, as the Troubles worsened, Gerard Newe had been appointed as a junior minister at Stormont, in an attempt to improve community relations. Fifty years after it came into existence, Newe was the first Catholic to serve in a Northern Ireland government, but because he was neither an MP nor a Senator, his appointment could last only six months. The influence of the Orange Order in the governance of Northern Ireland was far- reaching. All of the six prime ministers of Northern Ireland were members of the Order, as were all but three cabinet ministers until 1969. Three of the ministers later left the Order, one because his daughter married a Catholic, one to become Minister of Community Relations in 1970, and the third was expelled for attending a Catholic religious ceremony. Of the 95 Stormont MPs who did not become cabinet ministers, 87 were Orangemen. Every unionist senator, with one exception, between 1921 and 1969 was an Orangeman. One of these senators, James Gyle, was suspended from the Order for seven years for visiting nationalist MP Joe Devlin on his deathbed.

The username is a play on the words \\"Markov chain\\". Many readers were fooled into thinking that the quirky, sometimes uncannily topical posts were written by a real person. The system was designed by Rob Pike with coding by Bruce Ellis. Don P. Mitchell wrote the Markov chain code, initially demonstrating it to Pike and Ellis using the Tao Te Ching as a basis.

Pike created a \\"vicious\\" character named Bimmler. At its peak, net.suicide had ten frequent posters; nine were \\"known to be characters.\\" But ultimately, Pike deleted the newsgroup because it was too much work to maintain; Bimmler messages were created \\"by hand\\".

Baird and Catherine Richards, to be distributed by email. The piece was based on Jean Baudrillard's \\"The Precession of Simulacra\\", published in Simulacra and Simulation (1981). Reception The program was discussed by A.K. Dewdney in the Scientific American \\"Computer Recreations\\" column in 1989, by Penn Jillette in his PC Computing column in 1991, and in several books, including the Usenet Handbook, Bots: the Origin of New Species, Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes and Other B.S., and non-computer-related journals such as Texas Studies in Literature and Language. Dewdney wrote about the program's output, \\"The overall impression is not unlike what remains in the brain of an inattentive student after a late-night study session. Indeed, after reading the output of Mark V. Shaney, I find ordinary writing almost equally strange and incomprehensible!\\" He noted the reactions of newsgroup users, who have \\"shuddered at Mark V.

A few may even have thought that Mark V. Shaney was a real person, a tortured schizophrenic desperately seeking a like-minded companion.

It was used by instant messaging clients including Windows 8, Windows Live Messenger, Microsoft Messenger for Mac, Outlook.com and Xbox Live. Third-party clients also connected to the service. It communicated using the Microsoft Notification Protocol, a proprietary instant messaging protocol. The service allowed anyone with a Microsoft account to sign in and communicate in real time with other people who were signed in as well. On 11 January 2013 Microsoft announced that they were retiring the existing Messenger service globally (except for mainland China where Messenger will continue to be available) and replacing it with Skype. In April 2013, Microsoft merged the service into Skype network; existing users were able to sign into Skype with their existing accounts and access their contact list. As part of the merger, Skype instant messaging functionality is now running on the backbone of the former Messenger service. Background Despite multiple name changes to the service and its client software over the years, the Messenger service is often referred to colloquially as \\"MSN\\", due to the history of MSN Messenger. The service itself was known as MSN Messenger Service from 1999 to 2001, at which time, Microsoft changed its name to .NET Messenger Service and began offering clients that no longer carried the \\"MSN\\" name, such as the Windows Messenger client included with Windows XP, which was originally intended to be a streamlined version of MSN Messenger, free of advertisements and integrated into Windows. Nevertheless, the company continued to offer more upgrades to MSN Messenger until the end of 2005, when all previous versions of MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger were superseded by a new program, Windows Live Messenger, as part of Microsoft's launch of its Windows Live online services. For several years, the official name for the service remained .NET Messenger Service, as indicated on its official network status web page,Check the Microsoft .NET Messenger Service status though Microsoft rarely used the name to promote the service. Because the main client used to access the service became known as Windows Live Messenger, Microsoft started referring to the entire service as the Windows Live Messenger Service in its support documentation in the mid-2000s.Microsoft Help and Support: Important changes to Windows Live Messenger The service can integrate with the Windows operating system, automatically and simultaneously signing into the network as the user logs into their Windows account. Organizations can also integrate their Microsoft Office Communications Server and Active Directory with the service. In December 2011, Microsoft released an XMPP interface to the Messenger service. As part of a larger effort to rebrand many of its Windows Live services, Microsoft began referring to the service as simply Messenger in 2012.Messenger service status Software =Official clients= Microsoft offered the following instant messaging clients that connected to the Messenger service: * Windows 8, includes a built-in Messaging client * Windows Live Messenger, for users of Windows 7 and previous versions ** MSN Messenger was the former name of the client from 1999 to 2006 ** Windows Messenger is a scaled-down client that was included with Windows XP in 2001 * Microsoft Messenger for Mac, for users of Mac OS X * Outlook.com includes web browser-based functionality for instant messaging ** Hotmail, the predecessor to Outlook.com, includes similar functionality for Messenger ** Windows Live Web Messenger was a web-based program for use through Internet Explorer ** MSN Web Messenger was the former name of the web-based client * Xbox Live includes access to the Messenger service from within the Xbox Dashboard * Messenger on Windows Phone includes access to the Messenger service from within a phone running Windows Phone * Windows Live Messenger for iPhone and iPod Touch includes access to the Messenger service from within an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad * Messenger Play! includes access to the Messenger service from within an Android phone or tabletGet Messenger on your smartphone‚Äîit‚Äôs easy and it‚Äôs free!

The term indecent exposure is a legal expression. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from outright prohibition to prohibition of exposure of certain body parts, such as the genital area, buttocks or breasts. Decency is generally judged by the standards of the local community, which are seldom codified in specifics in law. Such standards may be based on religion, morality or tradition, or justified on the basis of \\"necessary to public order\\". Non-sexual exhibitionism or public nudity is sometimes considered indecent exposure. If sexual acts are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered gross indecency, which is usually a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency. The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure a complex topic.  Overview  It is generally accepted, at least in Western countries, that a naked human body is not in itself indecent. That principle is reflected, for example, in depiction of the human form in art of various forms. Nevertheless, as a general rule, it is also commonly expected that people when they appear in a public place will be appropriately attired. Inappropriateness is viewed in context, so that, for example, what may be appropriate on a beach may be inappropriate in a street, school or workplace. Depending on the context, some degree of inappropriateness may be tolerated, and perhaps described as eccentric, but in extreme cases of inappropriateness it may be regarded as \\"crossing the line\\". Besides the social disapproval of such a state of dress, most jurisdictions have laws to \\"maintain social order\\", variously described as public nudity, indecent exposure, as an affront to public morality, public nuisance, besides others. History What is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of decency of the community where an exposure takes place. These standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of modesty in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the Pirah√£ or Mursi where full nakedness is the norm. There is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature; and if such an allegation were to be made, the act would generally be described as \\"gross indecency\\". The standards of decency have varied over time. During the Victorian era, for example, exposure of a woman's legs, and to some extent the arms, was considered indecent in much of the Western world. Hair was sometimes required to be covered in formal occasions as in the form of a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s - and to some extent, the 1950s - both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing bathing suits that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her navel was also considered indecent in the West into the 1960s and 1970s, and even as late as the 1980s. Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s, which in turn changed the criteria for indecent exposure. Public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s, such as in beaches, while in the 2000s, the buttocks can be exposed while wearing a thong. For many years, however, it was quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States. Over the last decade (2010 till 2020) the numbers of women going topless on beaches has taken a sharp drop. This is often explained by the rising popularity of the smartphone, combined with websites where peeking men share pictures of (partly) naked women. Symbolism Although the phenomenon widely known as flashing, involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and bra, may be free from sexual motive or intent, it nonetheless is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior. Breastfeeding Breastfeeding in public does not constitute indecent exposure under the laws of the United States, Canada, Australia, or Scotland. In the United States, the federal government and all 50 states have enacted laws specifically protecting nursing mothers from harassment by others. Legislation ranges from simply exempting breastfeeding from laws regarding indecent exposure, to outright full protection of the right to nurse. Public clothing Public clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law. What parts of the body must be covered varies by region. Although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies, when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts, midriff, legs or shoulders, norms vary. For example, in some African cultures, it is the thighs, not the breasts, which must be covered. In some societies, the head hair, especially female, must be covered, usually with a scarf. The vast majority of cultures accept that the face can and must be seen, but some cultures (especially in the Middle East) require that a woman's face be covered under a burqa. In conservative societies, appearing in a public place in clothing that is deemed 'indecent' is illegal. In many countries there are exceptions to the general rules (social or legal) regarding clothing. For instance, a country which generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places, such as nude beaches, or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests.  Outraging public decency  Outraging public decency is a common law offence in England and WalesHalsbury's Laws of England 5th edition, volume 26, paragraph 717 and Hong Kong. It is punishable by unlimited imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. The first recorded example of the offence was Sedley's Case (1675) Strange 168, 1 Sid 168 ‚Äì Sir Charles Sedley was prosecuted for urinating on a crowd from the balcony of Oxford Kate's tavern in Covent Garden. Modern case law has established two elements that must be satisfied for the offence to have been committed:[2007 EWCA Crim 2062, [2008] QB 224 para 21 (CA)] # the act was of such a lewd character as to outrage public decency; this element constitutes the nature of the act, which has to be proved before the offence can be established, and # the act took place in a public place and must have been capable of being seen by two or more persons who were actually present, even if they did not actually see it. The offence is currently prosecuted around 400‚Äì500 times per year in England and Wales.Common Law Offences Charged and Reaching a First Hearing in Magistrates' Courts, Crown Prosecution Service Europe Attitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in Scandinavia, where genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed. In Finland, it is very typical for patrons to bathe nude in the intense heat of saunas. In the Netherlands, public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and \\"other suitable places\\". On nudist beaches, in unisex saunas and in swimming pool changing rooms, remaining partially clothed is frowned upon and the social norm is to undress. In Barcelona, public nudity was a recognised right. However, on 30 April 2011, the Barcelona City Council voted a by-law forbidding walking \\"naked or nearly naked in public spaces\\" and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks.APNEL Other countries, such as the UK, Ireland or Poland, are more conservative. =United Kingdom= Legislation concerning public nudity varies among the countries of the United Kingdom. In England and Wales public nudity is not in itself illegal; the use of the term \\"indecent exposure\\" dates back to earlier criminal law. England and Wales Here during the 19th and 20th centuries, indecent exposure was prosecuted under section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 or section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824. The latter contained a provision for the prosecution of: This provision was repealed by section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which replaced the offence of \\"indecent exposure\\" and other sexual offences with an offence that is more specific and explicit, exposure. It is defined as The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment, very rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service. If sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a community order in excess of 12 months such convicts (offenders) ‚Äì or if the person they exposed themselves to was aged under 18 years old ‚Äì they must appear on and sign the Violent and Sex Offender Register. In the past public nudity in England and Wales could also be punished as \\"disorderly behaviour\\" under the Public Order Act 1986, sections 4A and 5. However, the law was clarified in the spring of 2018 and those sections are no longer considered to apply to simple public nudity. Guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service and the College of Policing does not recommend prosecution for public nudity if there is no implied intent to cause alarm (or distress). Intention can be inferred by circumstantial evidence; see Intention in English law. Scotland Under Scots law, \\"indecent conduct\\" in a public place, such as exposing the genitals or engaging in sexual activity, can constitute the common law offence of public indecency. Stephen Gough, a man known as the \\"Naked Rambler\\" who hiked across Britain wearing only shoes, was arrested numerous times in Scotland. He was convicted of the common law offence of breach of the peace and spent time in prison for contempt of court for refusing to wear clothes whilst in court. Northern Ireland The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 brought the legislation regarding indecent exposure in Northern Ireland into line with that in England and Wales. United States The laws governing indecent exposure in the United States vary according to location. In most states public nudity is illegal. However, in some states it is only illegal if it is accompanied by an intent to shock, arouse or offend other persons. Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Most states exempt breastfeeding mothers from prosecution. Canada In Canada, s.173 of the Criminal Code prohibits \\"indecent acts\\".Part 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides, in part ‚Äì Indecent acts ‚Äì 173. (1) Every one who wilfully does an indecent act (a) in a public place in the presence of one or more persons...is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age. Thus, the decision of what states of undress are \\"indecent\\", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that nude sunbathing is not indecent.R. v. Beaupr√©, 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: \\"the phrase 'indecent act' connotes something more active, with greater moral turpitude than the mere state of being nude in a public place.\\" Also, streaking is similarly not regarded as indecent.R v Springer, 1975, Saskatchewan District CourtR v Niman, 1974, Ontario Provincial Court Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends \\"against public decency or order\\" and in view of the public. The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.R. v. Benolkin, 1977, Saskatchewan Court of the Queen's Bench. It was found that \\"It cannot be an offence to swim in the nude at a lonely place in Canada in summer. That is part of the pleasure of summer in Canada, particularly to young males. If somebody comes along unexpectedly or if the swimmer misjudged the loneliness of the place the act cannot suddenly become criminal.\\". Toplessness is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in Guelph, Ontario while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent. The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense.District of Maple Ridge v. Meyer, 2000 BCSC 902 (CanLII). See esp. para [49] and [55]. Since then it is legal for a female to walk topless in public anywhere in Ontario, Canada. Australia Protesters gathered outside a courthouse to protest against the arrest of Simon Oosterman (second from left), Auckland's 13 February 2005 WNBR organizer. In Australia, it is a summary or criminal offence in some States and Territories to expose one's genitals (also referred to as ‚Äì 'his or her person'). in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, obscenity, intention to cause offence or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply. Penalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state Acts, are as follows: *Australian Capital Territory ‚Äì Crimes Act 1900, section 393 ‚Äì 'indecent exposure' ‚Äì penalty 12 months. Under the Nudity Act 1976, the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted. Indecent exposure.. *New South Wales ‚Äì Summary Offences Act 1988, section 5 ‚Äì 'wilful and obscene exposure' ‚Äì penalty six months. Obscene exposure. *Northern Territory ‚Äì Summary Offences Act, section 50 ‚Äì 'indecent exposure' ‚Äì penalty 6 months. Penalty for indecent exposure of the person. *South Australia ‚Äì Summary Offences Act 1953, section 23 ‚Äì 'Indecent behaviour and gross indecency' ‚Äì penalty three months and six months respectively. Indecent behaviour and gross indecency . *Queensland ‚Äì Summary Offences Act 2005 No. 4, section 9 ‚Äì 'wilful exposure' ‚Äì penalty 12 months. Wilful exposure. *Tasmania ‚Äì Police Offences Act 1935, section 21 ‚Äì 'Prohibited behaviour' ‚Äì penalty 12 months. Prohibited behaviour. Police Offences Act 1935, section 14 ‚Äì 'Public decency' ‚Äì one penalty unit. Public decency. *Victoria ‚Äì Summary Offences Act 1966, section 19 ‚Äì 'wilful and obscene exposure' ‚Äì penalty two years. Wilful and obscene exposure. Under the Nudity (Prescribed Areas) Act 1983 the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted. *Western Australia ‚Äì Criminal Code, section 203 ‚Äì 'Indecent acts in public' ‚Äì criminal penalty two years. Summary conviction penalty: 9 months and fine of $9,000. section 203. =Definition of person= The laws of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory use the term \\"person\\", while in the other States the exposure refers to the genital area. It has been noted that a term such as \\"exposing one's person\\" relates back to the United Kingdom Vagrancy Act 1824 and Evans v Ewels (1972)Evans v Ewels [1972] 1 WLR 671. where it was said that the word \\"person\\" was a genteel synonym for \\"penis\\" or \\"vulva\\". However, it has been suggested that the word \\"person\\" in s5 of the (NSW) Summary Offences Act is not limited to \\"penis\\" or \\"vulva\\". For example, in R v Eyles (1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with obscene exposure under the NSW Act. The judge noted, obiter dicta, that New Zealand In New Zealand, indecent exposure is considered to be where a person \\"intentionally and obscenely exposes any part of his or her genitals\\".http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0113/latest/DLM53587.html Otherwise there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places, although lesser charges may apply depending on the behaviour of the individual in question. The High Court of New Zealand has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police request to cover themselves. Being prosecuted for nudity on a public beach, or any place where nudity might be expected, is very unlikely.  Saudi Arabia  Women in Saudi Arabia were required to wear robes and a headscarf when in public although Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said that it is not required. In September 2019, Saudi Arabia issued the public decency law identifying the rules related to the public decency that citizens and tourists should follow in compliance with Saudi law.

The term is somewhat vague. In principle, any language can be implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter. A combination of both solutions is also common: a compiler can translate the source code into some intermediate form (often called p-code or bytecode), which is then passed to an interpreter which executes it. Advantages and disadvantages Programs compiled into native code at compile time tend to be faster than those translated at run time, due to the overhead of the translation process. Newer technologies such as just-in-time compilation, and general improvements in the translation process are starting to narrow this gap, though. Mixed solutions using bytecode tend toward intermediate efficiency. Low-level programming languages are typically compiled, especially when efficiency is the main concern, rather than cross-platform support. For such languages, there are more one-to-one correspondences between the programmed code and the hardware operations performed by machine code, making it easier for programmers to control the use of central processing unit (CPU) and memory in fine detail. With some effort, it is always possible to write compilers even for traditionally interpreted languages. For example, Common lisp can be compiled to Java bytecode (then interpreted by the Java virtual machine), C code (then compiled to native machine code), or directly to native code.

It is thus the power of a constituent part (administrative division) of a state to exercise such of the state's powers of governance within its own administrative area that have been decentralized to it by the central government. In the British Isles, it traditionally referred to self- government, devolution or independence of its constituent nations‚Äîinitially Ireland, and later Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In the United States and other countries organised as federations of states, the term usually refers to the process and mechanisms of self-government as exercised by municipalities, counties, or other units of local government at the level below that of a federal state (e.g., US state, in which context see special legislation). It can also refer to the similar system under which Greenland and the Faroe Islands are associated with Denmark. Home rule is not, however, equivalent to federalism. Whereas states in a federal system of government (e.g., Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Ethiopia and the United States) have a guaranteed constitutional existence, a devolved home rule system of government is created by ordinary legislation and can be reformed, or even abolished, by repeal or amendment of that ordinary legislation. A legislature may, for example, create home rule for an administrative division, such as a province, a county, or a department, so that a local county council, county commission, parish council, or Board of supervisors may have jurisdiction over its unincorporated areas, including important issues like zoning. Without this, the division is simply an extension of the higher government. The legislature can also establish or eliminate municipal corporations, which have home rule within town or city limits through the city council. The higher government could also abolish counties/townships, redefine their boundaries, or dissolve their home-rule governments, according to the relevant laws.  Denmark  = Faroe Islands = The Faroe Islands is a self-governing country in the Danish Realm. Home rule was granted by the Parliament of Denmark in 1948, with further autonomy granted in 2005.State Department of Denmark: The Faroe Islands Home Rule Arrangement. Denmark's monarch is the Faroese head of state. The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union, even though Denmark is. = Greenland = Greenland is a self-governing country in the Danish Realm. Following a referendum in Greenland where the majority favored a higher degree of autonomy, home rule was granted by the Parliament of Denmark in 1979.State Department of Denmark: The Greenlandic Home Rule Arrangement. After another referendum, further autonomy was granted in 2009. Denmark's monarch is Greenland's head of state. Greenland is not part of the European Union, even though Denmark is.  Ireland  The issue of Irish home rule was the dominant political question of British and Irish politics at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. From the late nineteenth century, Irish leaders of the Home Rule League, the predecessor of the Irish Parliamentary Party, under Isaac Butt, William Shaw, and Charles Stewart Parnell demanded a form of home rule, with the creation of an Irish parliament within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. This demand led to the eventual introduction of four Home Rule Bills, of which two were passed, the Government of Ireland Act 1914 won by John Redmond and most notably the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (which created the home rule parliaments of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland ‚Äì the latter state did not in reality function and was replaced by the Irish Free State). The home rule demands of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century differed from earlier demands for Repeal by Daniel O'Connell in the first half of the nineteenth century. Whereas home rule meant a constitutional movement towards a national All- Ireland parliament in part under Westminster, repeal meant the repeal of the 1801 Act of Union (if need be, by physical force) and the creation of an entirely independent Irish state, separated from the United Kingdom, with only a shared monarch joining them. * 1886: First Irish Home Rule Bill was defeated in the House of Commons. * 1893: Second Irish Home Rule Bill passed by the House of Commons, vetoed in the House of Lords. * 1914: Third Irish Home Rule Bill passed to the statute books, temporarily suspended by intervention of World War I (1914‚Äì1918), finally following the Easter Rising in Dublin (1916). * 1920: Fourth Irish Home Rule Act (Government of Ireland Act 1920) fully implemented in Northern Ireland and partially implemented in Southern Ireland. Liberal leader Joseph Chamberlain led the battle against Home Rule in Parliament. He broke with the Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone who insisted on Home Rule, and in 1886 formed a new party, the Liberal Unionist Party. It helped defeat Home Rule and eventually merged with the Conservative party. Chamberlain used anti-Catholicism to built a base for the new party among \\"Orange\\" Nonconformist Protestant elements in Britain and Ireland. Liberal Unionist John Bright coined the party's catchy slogan, \\"Home rule means Rome rule.\\"  India  Several nationalist leaders banded together in 1916 under the leadership of Annie Besant to voice a demand for self- government, and to obtain the status of a Dominion within the British Empire as enjoyed by Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland at the time. While enjoying considerable popularity for some years, its growth and activity were stalled by the rise of Mohandas Gandhi and his satyagraha art of revolution: non-violent, but mass-based civil disobedience, aimed at complete independence.  United Kingdom  =England= English home rule has been discussed in relation to proposals for constitutional changes regarding England following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. = Scotland = In a similar fashion to Ireland, supporters of home rule in Scotland have historically desired greater levels of devolved governance within the United Kingdom. Although the term 'home rule' has been largely superseded by \\"devolution,\\" the home rule movement can be seen as the forerunner to the creation of the current devolved Scottish Parliament. Administrative devolution was granted to Scotland, with the creation of the Scottish Office, in 1885. In the mid-20th century, the home rule movement became significant, campaigning for a Scottish assembly. Between 1947 and 1950, the Scottish Covenant, a petition requesting a Scottish legislature within the UK, received over two million signatures. It was not until 1979 that devolution entered the political sphere ‚Äì the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum was held. Despite a vote of 51.6% in favour of devolution, the Scotland Act 1978 was not put into effect due to a requirement that the 'Yes' vote receive the support of 40% of the electorate, which was not met on 63.8% turnout. In 1999, due to the success of a second referendum, the Scottish Parliament was created.  United States  = Local government = In the United States, some states constitutionally or legislatively grant home rule to cities, counties, and municipalities within their borders. These are called \\"home rule states.\\" Local governments in home rule states are free to pass laws and ordinances as they see fit to further their operations, within the bounds of the state and federal constitutions. In other states, local governments have only the authority expressly granted to them by state legislatures, typically in accordance with the legal principle known as Dillon's Rule. A city charter, awarded by the state, defines the limits to a municipality‚Äôs powers. = District of Columbia = The US Constitution gives jurisdiction over the capital city (District of Columbia or Washington, D.C.) to the United States Congress in \\"all cases whatsoever\\". This arrangement is due to the fact that the District is neither a state, nor part of a state. At certain times, and presently since 1973, Congress has provided for D.C. government to be carried out primarily by locally elected officials. However, congressional oversight of this local government still exists, and locally elected officials' powers could theoretically be revoked at any time. = Native American reservations = The United States federal government provides limited self-rule to some federally recognised Native American tribes over their lands on reservations. Tribal lands are recognised as \\"dependent domestic nations\\" and operate a parallel system of governance and law independent of the state(s) which the reservation lies within, sometimes including separate police forces. For instance, some tribes are permitted to operate gambling establishments and produce narcotics which may be illegal in the surrounding state or states. Reservations are not states and have no direct representation in Congress, and the citizens vote as citizens of the state by which they are surrounded. Furthermore, unlike the sovereignty of state legislatures, tribal sovereignty and land ownership are not guaranteed by the Constitution and is granted only by an act of Congress, which can be repealed or altered at any time.

Biography  = Early life and career = Nichols was born on May 8, 1905 in Ogden, Utah, United States. His father was a college music professor, and Nichols was something of a child prodigy, playing difficult set pieces for his father's brass band by the age of 12. Young Nichols heard the early recordings of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band and later those of Bix Beiderbecke, and these had a strong influence on him. His style became polished, clean, and incisive. In the early 1920s, Nichols moved to the Midwest and joined a band called the Syncopating Seven. When that band broke up, he joined the Johnny Johnson Orchestra and went with it to New York City in 1923. In New York, he met trombonist Miff Mole, and the two were inseparable for the next decade. Before signing with Brunswick, Nichols and Mole recorded for Path√©-Perfect under the name the Red Heads. = Brunswick Records era = Nichols could read music and easily gained studio work. In 1926, he and Mole began recording with a variety of bands as Red Nichols and His Five Pennies. Few of these groups were quintets; the name was a pun on \\"nickel\\". With the Five Pennies, he recorded more than 100 sides for Brunswick. He also recorded as the Arkansas Travelers, the California Red Heads, the Louisiana Rhythm Kings, The Charleston Chasers, Red and Miff's Stompers, and Miff Mole and His Little Molers. During some weeks in this period, Nichols and his bands were recording 10 to 12 2-sided records. Nichols' band started with Mole on trombone and Jimmy Dorsey on alto saxophone and clarinet. Other musicians in his bands in the following decade included Benny Goodman (clarinet), Glenn Miller (trombone), Jack Teagarden (trombone), Pee Wee Russell (clarinet), Joe Venuti (violin), Eddie Lang (banjo and guitar), and Gene Krupa (drums). The Five Pennies' version of \\"Ida, Sweet as Apple Cider\\" was a surprise hit record. It sold over a million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America. In the next decade, more structured swing eclipsed the improvisational Dixieland jazz Nichols loved to play. He tried to follow the changes and formed a swing band, but his recording career seemed to stall in 1932. Music critic Michael Brooks wrote, > What went wrong? Part of it was too much, too soon. Much of his vast > recorded output was released in Europe, where he was regarded by early jazz > critics as the equal, if not the superior, of Louis Armstrong and Bix > Beiderbecke.

The > Fabulous Big Band Era 1925‚Äì1955. Other labels Nichols recorded for included Edison 1926, Victor 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931 (individual sessions), Bluebird 1934, 1939, back to Brunswick for a session in 1934, Variety 1937, and OKeh in 1940. = Later career = Nichols survived the Great Depression by playing in show bands and pit orchestras. He led Bob Hope's orchestra for a while, moving to California. Nichols married Willa Stutsman, a \\"stunning\\" George White's Scandals dancer, and they had a daughter.
