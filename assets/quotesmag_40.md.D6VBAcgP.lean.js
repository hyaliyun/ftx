The first such collection began in 1972, when Dazzini received a rare Esperanto book (the first grammar of Esperanto ever published in Italy, written by Daniele Marignoni). The book was donated by the Italian linguist Bruno Migliorini and his brother Elio Migliorini, a geographer.Amedeo Benedetti, L'Esperanto e la Biblioteca Nazionale di Massa, in \\"Charta\\", n. 97, May‚ÄìJune 2008, p. 63. The core of the library consisted not only of books provided by the Migliorinis, but also of works donated by Mr. Boscarino from Ragusa, by Corrado Grazzini, by Luigi Minnaja and by other Italian Esperantists. The library was first hosted in the Malaspina Castle, on the hills surrounding Massa, and was then moved to the building of the State Archive in Massa. In March 1994 the library and its archive were donated to the State and to the archive administration of the Italian Ministero per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali. The local Esperanto group in Massa began in January 2007 to catalogue the books and works hosted by the library,http://www.comune.massa.ms.it/?q=node/848 being helped and financed by the province of Massa-Carrara, together with the regional government of Tuscany and the Massa State Archive.

Overall, the library hosts around eight thousand books, of which the majority was donated by family Dazzini, and later by other Italian Esperantists. The collection also includes 176 magazines, not yet catalogued, as well as other documents such as travel diaries, correspondence, photographic images and music recordings. About half of the collection consists of translations in Esperanto of works of prose and poetry from every part of the world.

This condition generally begins between the ages of 18 and 30. It usually persists for a very long time, and often until the patient is around 40 years old. Although it often occurs where there is already an active acne problem, it can also happen to people whose acne has subsided. Although the cause of this type of acne is unknown, it is associated with testosterone and thus appears mainly in men. It can be caused by anabolic steroid abuse and sometimes appears in men after stopping testosterone therapy. It can also happen to someone who has a tumor that is releasing large amounts of androgens, or to people in remission from diseases, such as leukemia. In certain persons, the condition may be triggered by exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons or ingestion of halogens. Presentation Acne conglobata is a severe, inflammatory variant of acne. Inflammatory papules, papulonodules, nodules and pustules may coalesce, and abscesses in the skin may form sinuses that interconnect. Bleeding or draining of acneiform plaques may be present. The systemic findings seen in acne fulminans are not present. A component of the follicular occlusion tetrad, acne conglobata may be seen with hidradenitis suppurativa, pilonidal disease and dissecting cellulitis of the scalp.

It was founded in 1974 and led by Marshall Applewhite (1931‚Äì1997) and Bonnie Nettles (1927‚Äì1985). On March 26, 1997, deputies of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department discovered the bodies of 39 members of the group, including that of Applewhite, in a house in the San Diego suburb of Rancho Santa Fe. They had participated in a mass suicide, a coordinated series of ritual suicides, in order to reach what they believed was an extraterrestrial spacecraft following Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp. Just before the mass suicide, the group's website was updated with the message: \\"Hale‚ÄìBopp brings closure to Heaven's Gate... Our 22 years of classroom here on planet Earth is finally coming to conclusion‚Äî'graduation' from the Human Evolutionary Level. We are happily prepared to leave 'this world' and go with Ti's crew.\\"  History  The son of a Presbyterian minister and a former soldier, Marshall Applewhite began his foray into biblical prophecy in the early 1970s. After being fired from the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas over an alleged relationship with one of his male students, he met Bonnie Nettles, a 44-year- old married nurse with an interest in theosophy and biblical prophecy, in March 1972. According to Applewhite's writings, the two met in a hospital where she worked while he was visiting a sick friend there. It has been rumored that it was a psychiatric hospital, but Nettles was substituting for another nurse working with premature babies in the nursery. Applewhite later recalled that he felt as though he had known Nettles for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. Applewhite and Nettles pondered the life of St. Francis of Assisi and read works by authors including Helena Blavatsky, R. D. Laing, and Richard Bach. They kept a King James Bible with them and studied several passages from the New Testament, focusing on teachings about Christology, asceticism, and eschatology. Applewhite also read science fiction, including works by Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke. By June 19, Applewhite and Nettles's beliefs had solidified into a basic outline. They concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people. They wrote a pamphlet that described Jesus' reincarnation as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite. Furthermore, they concluded that they were the two witnesses described in the Book of Revelation and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities, often referring to themselves as \\"The Two\\", or \\"The UFO Two\\". They believed they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as \\"the Demonstration\\", was to prove their claims. To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received by existing religious communities. Eventually, Applewhite and Nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials, and they sought like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called \\"the crew\\". At the events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They stated that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level. In 1975, during a group meeting with eighty people in Joan Culpepper's Studio City home, they shared their \\"simultaneous\\" revelation that they had been told they were the two witnesses written into the Bible's story of the end time. Later in 1975, the crew assembled at a hotel in Waldport, Oregon. After selling all \\"worldly\\" possessions and saying farewell to loved ones, the group vanished from the hotel and from the public eye. That night on the CBS Evening News, Walter Cronkite reported that the group had disappeared, in one of the first national reports on the developing religious group: \\"A score of persons... have disappeared. It's a mystery whether they've been taken on a so-called trip to eternity‚Äîor simply been taken.\\" In reality, Applewhite and Nettles had arranged for the group to go underground. From that point, \\"Do and Ti\\" (pronounced \\"doe and tee\\"), as the two now called themselves, led the nearly one-hundred-member crew across the country, sleeping in tents and sleeping bags and begging in the streets. Evading detection by the authorities and media enabled the group to focus on Do and Ti's doctrine of helping members of the crew achieve a \\"higher evolutionary level\\" above human, which they claimed to have already reached. Applewhite and Nettles used a variety of aliases over the years, notably \\"Bo and Peep\\" and \\"Do and Ti\\". The group also had a variety of names‚Äîprior to the adoption of the name Heaven's Gate (and at the time Vall√©e studied the group), it was known as Human Individual Metamorphosis (HIM). The group re-invented and renamed itself several times and had a variety of recruitment methods.Ryan J. Cook, Heaven's Gate , webpage retrieved 2008-10-10. Applewhite believed he was directly related to Jesus, meaning he was an \\"Evolutionary Kingdom Level Above Human\\". Indeed, Applewhite's writings, which combined aspects of Millennialism, Gnosticism, and science fiction, suggest he believed himself to be Jesus' successor and the \\"Present Representative\\" of Christ on Earth. Do and Ti taught during the religious movement's early beginnings that Do's bodily \\"vehicle\\" was inhabited by the same alien spirit which belonged to Jesus; likewise, Ti (Nettles) was presented as God the Father. The crew used numerous methods of recruitment as they toured the United States in destitution, proclaiming the gospel of higher level metamorphosis, the deceit of humans by false-god spirits, envelopment with sunlight for meditative healing, and the divinity of the \\"UFO Two\\". Throughout the late 70s and early 80s, as their belief system developed around the cult of personalities, membership grew. Some sociologists agree that the popular movement of alternative religious experience and individualism found in collective spiritual experiences during that period helped contribute to the growth of the new religious movement. \\"Sheilaism\\", as it became known, was a way for people to merge their diverse religious backgrounds and coalesce around a shared, generalized faith, which followers of new religious sects like Applewhite's crew found a very appetizing alternative to traditional dogmas in Judaism, Catholicism and evangelical Christianity. Many of Applewhite and Nettle's crew hailed from these very diverse backgrounds; most of them are described by researchers as having been \\"longtime truth-seekers\\", or spiritual hippies who had long since believed in attempting to \\"find themselves\\" through spiritual means, combining faiths in a sort of cultural milieu well into the mid-80s. However, remarkably, many of those same researchers note that not all of Applewhite's crew were hippies recruited from far-left alternative religious backgrounds‚Äîin fact, one such recruit early on was John Craig, a respected Republican running for the Colorado House of Representatives at the time of joining in 1975. As recruit numbers grew in its pre-Internet days, the clan of \\"UFO followers\\" all seemed to have in common a need for communal belonging in an alternative path to higher existence without the constraints of institutionalized faith. It was not until the death of Nettles due to liver cancer in 1985 and Applewhite's subsequent revision of the group's doctrines that the crew gained an eventual reputation as a \\"cyberculture\\" form of religious thought reform; by the mid-90s, the group had become reclusive, identifying themselves using the business name \\"Higher Source\\", and using their website to proselytize and recruit followers. Rumors began spreading throughout the group in the following years that the upcoming Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp housed the secret to their ultimate salvation and ascendance into the kingdom of heaven. = Contemporary media coverage = Heaven's Gate received coverage in Jacques Vall√©e's book Messengers of Deception (1979), in which Vall√©e described an unusual public meeting organized by the group. Vall√©e frequently expressed concerns within the book about contactee groups' authoritarian political and religious outlooks, and Heaven's Gate did not escape criticism. Known to the mainstream media (though largely ignored through the 1980s and 1990s), Heaven's Gate was better known in UFO circles, as well as through a series of academic studies by sociologist Robert Balch. In January 1994, the LA Weekly ran an article on the group, then known as \\"The Total Overcomers\\". Richard Ford, who would later play a key role in the 1997 group suicide, discovered Heaven's Gate through this article and eventually joined them, renaming himself Rio DiAngelo. Coast to Coast AM host Art Bell featured the theory of the \\"companion object\\" in the shadow of Hale‚ÄìBopp on several programs, as early as November 1996; speculation has been raised as to whether his programs on the subject contributed to Heaven's Gate's group suicide months later. Louis Theroux contacted the Heaven's Gate group while making a program for his BBC2 documentary series, Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends, in early March 1997. In response to his e-mail, Theroux was told that Heaven's Gate could not take part in the documentary because \\"at the present time a project like this would be an interference with what we must focus on.\\" = Mass suicide = In October 1996, members of Ti's clan began renting a large home which they called \\"The Monastery\\", a mansion located near 18341 Colina Norte (later changed to Paseo Victoria) in Rancho Santa Fe, California. They paid $7,000 per month, in cash.\\"The Marker We've Been... Waiting For\\", by Elizabeth Gleick, Cathy Booth and Pmes Willwerth (Rancho Santa Fe); Nancy Harbert (Albuquerque); Rachele Kanigal (Oakland) and Richard N. Ostling and Noah Robischon (New York). Time. Monday, April 7, 1997. In the same month, the group purchased alien abduction insurance that would cover up to fifty members and would pay out $1 million per person (the policy covered abduction, impregnation, or death by aliens).Edith Lederer, \\"Alien Abduction Insurance Cancelled!\\", Associated Press, 2April 1997, Retrieved March 12, 2008 On March 19‚Äì20, 1997, Marshall Applewhite taped himself in Do's Final Exit, speaking of mass suicide and \\"the only way to evacuate this Earth\\". After asserting that a spacecraft was trailing Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp and that this event would represent the \\"closure to Heaven's Gate\\", Applewhite persuaded 38 followers to prepare for ritual suicide so their souls could board the supposed craft. Applewhite believed that after their deaths an unidentified flying object (UFO) would take their souls to another \\"level of existence above human\\", which he described as being both physical and spiritual. Their preparations included each member's videotaping a farewell message. To kill themselves, members took phenobarbital mixed with apple sauce or pudding and washed it down with vodka. Additionally, they secured plastic bags around their heads after ingesting the mix to induce asphyxiation. All 39 were dressed in identical black shirts and sweat pants, brand new black-and-white Nike Decades athletic shoes, and armband patches reading \\"Heaven's Gate Away Team\\" (one of many instances of the group's use of the Star Trek fictional universe's nomenclature). Each member had on their person a five-dollar bill and three quarters in their pockets: the five-dollar bill was to cover vagrancy fines while members were out on jobs, while the quarters were to make phone calls. Once a member was dead, a living member would arrange the body by removing the plastic bag from the person's head, followed by posing the body so that it lay neatly in its own bed, with faces and torsos covered by a square purple cloth for privacy. The identical clothing was used as a uniform for the mass suicide to represent unity, whilst the Nike Decades were chosen because the group \\"got a good deal on the shoes\\". The 39 adherents, 21 women and 18 men between the ages of 26 and 72, are believed to have died in three groups over three successive days, with remaining participants cleaning up after each prior group's deaths. The suicides occurred in groups of fifteen, fifteen, and nine, between approximately March 22 and March 26. Among the dead was Thomas Nichols, brother of the actress Nichelle Nichols, who is best known for her role as Uhura in the original Star Trek television series. Leader Applewhite was the third to last member to die; two people remained after him and were the only ones who would be found without bags over their heads and not having purple cloths covering their top halves. Before the last of the suicides, similar sets of packages were sent to numerous Heaven's Gate affiliated (or formerly affiliated) individuals, and at least one media outlet, the BBC department responsible for Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends, for which Heaven's Gate had earlier declined participation. Among those in the list of recipients was Rio DiAngelo. The package DiAngelo received on the evening of March 25, Alt URL as other packages sent had, contained two VHS videotapes, one with Do's Final Exit, and the other with the \\"farewell messages\\" of group followers. It also contained a letter, stating that among other things, \\"we have exited our vehicles, just as we entered them.\\" Upon informing his boss of the contents of the packages, DiAngelo received a ride from him from Los Angeles to the Heaven's Gate home in Rancho Santa Fe so he could verify the letter. DiAngelo found a back door purposely left unlocked to allow access, and used a video camera to record what he found. After leaving the house, DiAngelo's boss, who had waited outside, encouraged him to make calls to authorities alerting them to his discovery. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department received an anonymous tip through the 911 system at 3:15 p.m. on March 26, suggesting they \\"check on the welfare of the residents\\". Days after the suicides, this caller was revealed to be DiAngelo. The single deputy who first responded to the call entered the home through a side door, saw ten bodies, and was nearly overcome by a \\"pungent odor\\". (The bodies were already decomposing in the hot California spring.) After a cursory search by two deputies found no one alive, both retreated until a search warrant could be procured. All 39 bodies were ultimately cremated. = Aftermath = The Heaven's Gate event was widely publicized in the media as an example of mass suicide. When news broke of the suicides and their relation to Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp, the co-discoverer of the comet, Alan Hale, was drawn into the story. Hale's phone \\"never stopped ringing the entire day\\". He did not respond until the next day, when he spoke on the subject at a press conference, but only after researching the details of the incident. Speaking at the Second World Skeptics Congress in Heidelberg, Germany on July 24, 1998: Hale said that well before Heaven's Gate, he had told a colleague: News of the 39 deaths in Rancho Santa Fe motivated the copycat suicide of a 58-year-old man living near Marysville, California. The man left a note dated March 27, which said, \\"I'm going on the spaceship with Hale‚ÄìBopp to be with those who have gone before me,\\" and imitated some of the details of the Heaven's Gate suicides as they had been reported in the media up to that point. The man was found dead by a friend on March 31, and had no known connection with Heaven's Gate. At least three former members of Heaven's Gate ultimately died by suicide themselves in the months after the mass suicide event. On May 6, 1997, Wayne Cooke and Chuck Humphrey attempted suicide in a hotel in a manner similar to that used by the group. Cooke died and Humphrey survived this attempt. Another former member, James Pirkey Jr., died by suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound on May 11. Humphrey, who had survived his first suicide attempt, ultimately killed himself in Arizona in February 1998. Faye Kellerman's novel Jupiter's Bones (1998) and Travis Jeppesen's novel, Victims (2003), were inspired in part by the Heaven's Gate group. Two former members, Marc and Sarah King of Phoenix, Arizona still maintain the group's website, which now contains a large passage addressing the mass suicide and the reasons for it. The two do not identify themselves in interviews. In July 2018, American rapper Lil Uzi Vert posted promotional art for his upcoming studio album Eternal Atake, which would release on 6th of March 2020, to his Instagram. The artwork incorporated a reworking of the Heaven's Gate \\"keyhole\\" logo. The group's two survivors threatened Lil Uzi Vert, who at the time used a picture of Marshall Applewhite as his Instagram avatar, with copyright infringement litigation. The infamy caused by the mass suicides, limited availability and its sudden and unceremonious discontinuation has been cited as the reason why Nike Decades command such high resale value. One seller has reportedly tried to sell them at $6,660.  Belief system  Heaven's Gate members believed the planet Earth would be \\"recycled\\" (\\"wiped clean, renewed, refurbished, and rejuvenated\\") before 2027 and the only chance for their consciousness (defined sometimes as soul or mind) to survive was to leave their human bodies at an appointed time. Initially the group had been told that they would be transported with their bodies aboard a spacecraft that would come to Earth and take the crew to heaven, referred to as the \\"next level\\". When Bonnie Lou Nettles (Ti) died of cancer in 1985, it confounded Applewhite's doctrine because Nettles was allegedly chosen by the next level to be a messenger on Earth, yet her body died instead of leaving physically to outer space. The belief system was then refined to include the leaving of consciousness from the body as equivalent to leaving the Earth in a spacecraft. While the group was against suicide, they defined \\"suicide\\" in their own context to mean \\"to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered\\" and believed their \\"human\\" bodies were only vessels meant to help them on their journey. Suicide, therefore, would be not allowing their consciousness to leave their human bodies to join the next level; remaining alive instead of participating in the group suicide was considered suicide of their consciousness. In conversation, when referring to a person or a person's body, they routinely used the word \\"vehicle\\". The members of the group added -ody to the first names they adopted in lieu of their original given names, which defines \\"children of the Next Level\\". This is mentioned in Applewhite's final video, Do's Final Exit, filmed March 19‚Äì20, 1997, just days prior to the suicides. They believed that, \\"to be eligible for membership in the Next Level, humans would have to shed every attachment to the planet\\". This meant all members had to give up all human- like characteristics, such as their family, friends, sexuality, individuality, jobs, money, and possessions. \\"The Evolutionary Level Above Human\\" (TELAH) was as a \\"physical, corporeal place\\", another world in our universe, where residents live in pure bliss and nourish themselves by absorbing pure sunlight. At the next level, beings do not engage in sexual intercourse, eating or dying, the things that make us \\"mammalian\\" here. Heaven's Gate believed that what the Bible calls God is actually a highly developed Extraterrestrial. Members of Heaven's Gate believed that evil space aliens‚Äîcalled Luciferians‚Äîfalsely represented themselves to Earthlings as \\"God\\" and conspired to keep humans from developing. Technically advanced humanoids, these aliens have spacecraft, space-time travel, telepathy, and increased longevity. They use holograms to fake miracles. Carnal beings with gender, they stopped training to achieve the Kingdom of God thousands of years ago. Heaven's Gate believed that all existing religions on Earth had been corrupted by these malevolent aliens. Although these basic beliefs of the group stayed generally consistent over the years, \\"the details of their ideology were flexible enough to undergo modification over time.\\" There are examples of the group's adding to or slightly changing their beliefs, such as: modifying the way one can enter the Next Level, changing the way they described themselves, placing more importance on the idea of Satan, and adding several other New Age concepts. One of these concepts was the belief of extraterrestrial walk-ins; when the group began, \\"Applewhite and Nettles taught their followers that they were extraterrestrial beings. However, after the notion of walk-ins became popular within the New Age subculture, the Two changed their tune and began describing themselves as extraterrestrial walk- ins.\\" The idea of walk-ins is very similar to the concept of being possessed by spirits. A walk-in can be defined as \\"an entity who occupies a body that has been vacated by its original soul\\". Heaven's Gate came to believe an extraterrestrial walk-in is \\"a walk-in that is supposedly from another planet\\". The concept of walk-ins aided Applewhite and Nettles in personally starting from what they considered to be clean slates. In this so-called clean slate, they were no longer considered by members of this Heaven's Gate group to be the people they had been prior to the start of the group, but had taken on a new life; this concept gave them a way to \\"erase their human personal histories as the histories of souls who formerly occupied the bodies of Applewhite and Nettles\\". Over time Applewhite also refined his identity in the group to encourage the belief that the \\"walk in\\" that was inhabiting his body was the same that had done so to Jesus 2,000 years ago. Similar to Nestorianism this belief stated that the personage of Jesus and the spirit of Jesus were separable. This meant that Jesus was simply the name of the body of an ordinary man that held no sacred properties that was taken over by an incorporeal sacred entity to deliver \\"next level\\" information. Another New Age belief Applewhite and Nettles adopted was the ancient astronaut hypothesis. The term \\"ancient astronauts\\" is used to refer to various forms of the concept that extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past. Applewhite and Nettles took part of this concept and taught it as the belief that \\"aliens planted the seeds of current humanity millions of years ago, and have to come to reap the harvest of their work in the form of spiritually evolved individuals who will join the ranks of flying saucer crews. Only a select few members of humanity will be chosen to advance to this transhuman state. The rest will be left to wallow in the spiritually poisoned atmosphere of a corrupt world.\\" Only the individuals who chose to join Heaven's Gate, follow Applewhite and Nettle's belief system, and make the sacrifices required by membership would be allowed to escape human suffering. = Techniques to enter the next level = According to Heaven's Gate, once the individual has perfected himself through the \\"process\\", there were four methods to enter or \\"graduate\\" to the next level: # Physical pickup onto a TELAH spacecraft and transfer to a next level body aboard that craft. In this version, what Professor Zeller calls a \\"UFO\\" version of the \\"Rapture\\", an alien spacecraft would descend to Earth and collect Applewhite, Nettles, and their followers, and their human bodies would be transformed through biological and chemical processes to perfected beings. This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of UFO religion. # Natural death, accidental death, or death from random violence. Here, the \\"graduating soul\\" leaves the human container for a perfected next- level body. # Outside persecution that leads to death. After the deaths of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, and the events involving Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Applewhite was afraid the American government would murder the members of Heaven's Gate. # Willful exit from the body in a dignified manner. Near the end, Applewhite had a revelation that they might have to abandon their human bodies and achieve the next level as Jesus had done. This occurred on March 22 and 23 when 39 members died by suicide and \\"graduated\\".  Structure  In a group open only to adults over the age of 18, members gave up their possessions and lived a highly ascetic life devoid of many indulgences. The group was tightly knit and everything was communally shared. In public, each member of the group always carried only a five-dollar bill and one roll of quarters. Eight of the male members of the group, including Applewhite, voluntarily underwent castration in Mexico as an extreme means of maintaining the ascetic lifestyle. The group initially attempted castration by having one of the members, a former nurse, perform the castration, but this initial attempt was very unsuccessful, almost resulted in the patient's death, and caused at least one member to leave Heaven's Gate. Every castration that followed this initial one was done in a hospital.Investigation Discovery. (2019). Heaven's Gate. People's Magazine Investigates: Cults. The group earned revenues by offering professional website development for paying clients under the business name Higher Source. The cultural theorist Paul Virilio has described the group as a cybersect, owing to its heavy reliance on computer mediated communication as a mode of communication prior to its collective suicide.Paul Virilio, The Information Bomb (Verso, 2005), p. 41.  In popular culture  In its first live episode following the mass suicide, Saturday Night Live aired a sketch where the cult members really did end up in space. It was followed by a commercial parody, featuring footage of the Nike-clad corpses. The ad was for Keds, marketed \\"for level headed Christians\\". The sect is briefly and indirectly mentioned in a scene in the 1997 film Contact directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Jodie Foster in which, after the receiving of a message from outer space located in the star Vega, CNN's journalist Natalie Allen (playing herself in a cameo) talks about its religious implications by \\"recent cult deaths near San Diego\\". The sect is briefly and indirectly mentioned in the 1998 song Swim by Madonna in her album Ray of Light. The incident took place after the appearance of the comet Hale- Bopp during the eclipse in China. \\"Comets fly across the sky While the churches burn their preachers We can't carry these sins on our back Don't want to carry anymore\\" Episode 23 (\\"Brain Scratch\\") of the popular Japanese anime series Cowboy Bebop centers on a sect dedicated to its members' \\"ascension\\" into the technological singularity. The sect's leader, Londes, resembles Applewhite and speaks through wild-eyed camera closeups reminiscent of Applewhite's own videos on the Heaven's Gate web page. The English electronic act Meat Beat Manifesto features samples of Marshall Applewhite speaking in the song \\"Hail to the Bopp\\" on their 1998 album Actual Sounds + Voices. The Irish band Therapy? released a song titled \\"Heaven's Gate\\" on their 1998 album Semi-Detached. In the April 11, 1999 Family Guy episode \\"Chitty Chitty Death Bang\\", Meg Griffin is recruited into a cult similar to Heaven's Gate where male members of the group were eunuchs, all members wore matching tracksuits and shoes, lived together in a large house, and planned to die by mass suicide. In the 2000 film Dude, Where's My Car? the main characters stumble onto a UFO cult based on Heaven's Gate. The cult members all wear the same type of sneakers, like the members of Heaven's Gate. In the 2009 film Up In The Air, George Clooney's character briefly references Heaven's Gate when he says \\"Now those cult members in San Diego, with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers? They didn't die alone.\\" The English band Porcupine Tree referenced the cult in their 2000 song \\"Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled\\", which features the cult leader's speech. The song \\"Propane Nightmares\\" by Australian/British drum and bass band Pendulum features many references to their mass suicide in the music video and the song itself. In 2012, Captain Murphy released a 34-minute-long video album titled Duality focusing on the theme of Heaven's Gate. The band Andrew Jackson Jihad has a song referencing Heaven's Gate titled \\"Do, Re, and Me\\" on their 2014 album Christmas Island. Musician Isabelle Reine has two songs referencing Heaven's Gate called \\"Gates of Heaven\\" and \\"Beyond The Gates\\" in her 2019 album \\"I'll Be Dead By Tomorrow\\" https://open.spotify.com/album/05fjHBUEFaedhKnduaVVdE https://beebmusic.bandcamp.com/track/gates-of-heaven-2 Techno artist Joel Dunn has been releasing music under the stage name Marshall Applewhite since 2014. English indie pop band The Go! Team released a song titled \\"The Art of Getting By (Song for Heaven's Gate)\\" on their 2015 album The Scene Between. Rapper Ghostemane released a song titled \\"Heavens Gate Has the Best Punch\\" on his 2015 album For the Aspiring Occultist. The 2017 album The Demonstration by the darkwave band Drab Majesty was heavily inspired by and full of references to the events surrounding Heaven's Gate. New Orleans rap duo $uicideboy$ used an image of the Heaven's Gate suicides as the art for their 2017 EP KILL YOURSELF Part XX: The Infinity Saga. American thrash metal band Testament recorded \\"Children of the Next Level\\" on their 2020 album Titans of Creation, which refers to the mass suicide. An animated music video was made for the song which further referenced the mass suicide and depicted the cultists being brainwashed by Applewhite. In the 2016 film Deadpool, Wade Wilson compares Professor X's appearance to the leader of Heaven's Gate. In their song \\"1997\\", the band Saint Motel mentions a \\"dangerous crowd\\" and that \\"it happened in 1997\\". In the video, the band members drink something and their spirits leave their bodies. The plot of the video game Far Cry 5 involves battling against the fictional cult Eden's Gate, an ultra-conservative doomsday sect. The plot of the 2019 psychological horror film The Lodge features references to the Heaven's Gate mass suicide, including visual nods to the purple shrouds covering the victims' bodies. In March 2020, American rapper Lil Uzi Vert released the album Eternal Atake, which has many references to Heaven's Gate, including an image that is heavily inspired by the Heaven's Gate logo.

The largest Bangladeshi communities are mainly present in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, with large concentrations in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. History As a result of partition of India in 1947, East Bengal state of Colonial India became East Pakistan, bengali speaking part of the Punjabi dominated and newly formed nation of Pakistan. East Pakistan was governed by West Pakistan, which was situated about 1500 kilometres to the west, separated by India. Differences between the two led to an outbreak of Bengali nationalism. After the Bangladesh Liberation War by the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini against Pakistan Army, the independent state of Bangladesh, meaning \\"Bengali nation\\", was proclaimed on 26 March 1971. The new country became a parliamentary democracy under a 1972 constitution. The Bangladesh-born are relatively new migrants to Australia. Since 1970s, migration from Bangladesh has steadily increased with the majority arriving under the Skilled Migration Program. Most Bangladesh-born have settled in the urban areas of New South Wales while smaller numbers settled in other states and territories.

This condition is said to be seasonal, usually affecting people in the spring time and goes away in the fall time when there is less sun light. This photo induced skin reaction leads to a monomorphous eruption that consists of multiple, uniform, red, popular lesions. This skin reaction is classified as a delayed-type hypersensitivity because the onset is 24‚Äì72 hours after sun exposure. The condition equally affects men and women between the ages of 20‚Äì40 years old with no prior history of acne vulgaris. The eruption is unusual because it spares the face but it affects the lateral aspects of the upper arms, shoulder girdle, back, and chest. This condition‚Äôs pathogenesis is not very well understood but scientists believe it an unfortunate side effect that results from a strong immune response to potentially cancer-causing cell damage.  Signs and Symptoms  Patients present numerous lesions of small papules that are dull red, dome shaped, hard, and usually not more than 2‚Äì4 mm in diameter. These lesions do not affect the face but affect lateral aspects of upper arms, shoulder girdle, back, and chest. The papules have an onset of 1‚Äì3 days after sun exposure and may last for many weeks. Comedones are not present in this type of skin reaction.  Cause  The main cause of this condition is sun exposure. Hypersensitivity to the sun may be experienced due to genetic predisposition. It is also speculated that cosmetics and sun care products containing hydroxyl peroxides may trigger this condition through free radical and ultra violet A radiation photo-toxic reactions.  Mechanism/pathophysiology  The actual mechanism of disease is not very well understood but there are a few speculations. It is believed that acne aestivalis has a genetic predisposition involved in which people who show acne aestivalis have lower expression of apoptosis inducing genes which leads to inflammation. Inflammation is believed to be triggered by circulating ultra violet radiation damaged cells that could not go through apoptosis and the cell fragments they release. Also, it is speculated that this sun induced acne form is caused by a photo allergic reaction between sunscreen, skin, and the sun. A photo-toxic reaction pathogenesis is also possible through free radical release in sun screen oxidation by ultra violet radiation.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis is by visual examination of skin lesions and sun exposure history. A diagnosis of acne aestivalis is made once the patient reports the onset of papules was 1‚Äì3 days after sun exposure.  Treatment  The treatment for this condition is topical tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide applied to the skin. The use of topical steroids should be avoided. Currently, there is no systemic treatment for acne aestivalis. Prognosis This condition is alleviated during the fall season when there is less sun light available. The papules do not leave a scar on the affected person's skin.  Epidemiology  There is limited information on the epidemiology of this condition. This disease was first noticed in Scandinavian men and women between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. The skin eruption would present in this population after sunbathing in Mallorca beach after a long and dark winter season.  Recent Research  In 2001, a study was conducted to test a prophylaxis regimen containing alpha- glucosylrutin, a strong plant-derived antioxidant. The focus of the experiment was to evaluate the effects of alpha-glucosylrutin on polymorphous light eruption and acne aestivalis development. The study demonstrated that applying alpha-glucosylrutin along with SPF 15 sunscreen decreases severe polymorphous light eruption cases from 96.2% to 7.4%.The study included 20 people with polymorphous light eruption and 3 people with acne aestivalis. In this study, 2 out of the 3 people with acne aestivalis did not have an episode of lesions after being prophylactically treated with alpha-glucosylrutin and SPF 15.

In the 1930s, he became the central member of the artists' colony known as the Odsherred Painters and was one of the founding members of the Corner artists association. Biography Born in Frederikshavn, Bovin was the eldest son of a stone mason. He was interested in art from an early age. In the 1920s, he cycled to the artists paradise Skagen in the north of Jutland to show Anna and Michael Ancher some of his early work. As a result of their encouragement, he attended the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen from 1928 to 1931 where he studied under Sigurd Wandel and Aksel J√∏rgensen. Here he came together with a group of constructivists who relied largely on intuition and observation but was not happy with their approach. He therefore joined fellow artist Kaj Ejstrup in Odsherred where there were excellent opportunities to concentrate on nature and landscape painting. Slowly other artists followed, forming the so-called Odsherredsmalerne (Odsherred Painters) who founded the Corner painters association. In 1932, Bovin was successful in having one of his landscapes bought by Statens Museum for Kunst, the Danish national gallery, reinforcing his reputation. In the early 1930s, he also spent some time with the Funen Painters, especially Johannes Larsen and Fritz Syberg establishing a relationship between the two artists' colonies. Painting styles His earlier paintings are characterised by dull tones, no doubt influenced by the woes of the times. However, by the end of the 1930s, his paintings became livelier. He specialized in landscapes, producing works which often had a high horizon and excelled in conveying the changing weather conditions encountered in Odsherred. Several of his early works depict scenes of winter and autumn with ploughed fields and the occasional farm building. Later he adopted a lighter palette and painted summer scenes, often comparable to those of the Funen Painters. A period he spent in Skagen in the mid-1950s contributed to his rather sketchy manner of painting with stronger and more brilliant colour. After travelling to Bahrein with the archaeologist P.V. Glob in the 1950s and 1960s, his paintings benefited from even more colour and brightness. Indeed, he found he could better represent these effects in watercolours than in oils. Though closely involved with the impressionists, he continued to develop his own style and motifs with the result that he became one of the best landscape painters of the 20th century, painting his natural surroundings in winter, summer and spring. Bovin continued to paint until the 1970s, when poor health prevented him from continuing further. Much of his work can be seen at Odsherreds Museum of Art but the largest collection of all, some 120 items, is at Frederikshavn Art Museum. Family Bovin first married the artist Amy Victoria Krog-Jensen in 1934. After the marriage had been dissolved in 1951 he married the painter Bertha (Birthe) Marie Marensine Pedersen in 1952. Known as Birthe Bovin, she also painted watercolours and oils of the Odsherred landscape.

It is a state funded secondary school for both girls and boys. The schools moto is \\"doctrina promovet\\" which translates from Latin to \\"learning promotes\\" which the school emphases within their \\"vision, values and aims\\". There are two notable buildings; the Minerva Building 1895-7 by F J C Carruthers and a later building by County Architect John R Hill, 1936. History Dumfries Academy dates back to the 14th century, making it the earliest school in the Dumfries area. The school has occupied a number of different buildings, and has existed in its present form since 1804. Early records show that John of Greyfriars, a monk, was appointed rector of a new school in Dumfries in 1330. Being a church school it concentrated on the study of religious texts, but in the centuries which followed other schools built in the town which taught subjects such as brewing, mathematics, English, baking, and needlework became integrated into the Academy building. The Academy operated as a grammar school for those in Dumfries deemed academically gifted as based on exam results until July 1983. The most gifted students from three surrounding secondary schools transferred to the Academy after second year. As a result, Dumfries Academy had the highest rate of university entrance of any state school for many years.  The Minerva building  Minerva Building alt= The oldest building currently part of the school is the Minerva building. It was designed by prolific local architect F J C Carruthers, and built in 1895 -97 by stonemasons Houston and Robison. This is a two storey building red sandstone in the English Baroque style with ornate carvings by sculptor James H. Douglas of Carlisle. The dome of the building features a gilded teak statue of Minerva, representing learning, from which the building gets its name. It was sculpted by Mr. Craig from Glasgow, following from the original architectural drawings by Carruthers. The Minerva building also features winged lions on either side of the door, and others around the cupola. There is an extensive description in Buildings of Scotland: Dumfries and Galloway by John Gifford. Uniform The current uniform of Dumfries Academy consists of a white shirt, black trousers or skirt, a black blazer with the school crest attached and a maroon and black striped tie. During the 2006-2007 academic year, a senior tie consisting of a black background with white and maroon stripes and the school crest was introduced, to go along with the junior tie consisting of a maroon background with white and black stripes with the school crest. Junior Pupils from S1-S3 wear the junior tie and senior pupils from S4-6 wear the senior tie. S6 pupils that are either head pupils or deputy head pupils will also wear stripes on their uniform, two stripes for head pupils and one for deputy head pupils. Dumfries Academy today The Academy has been a six-year comprehensive school since July 1985 serving part of the Burgh of Dumfries and surrounding rural communities, with an average roll of over 600 pupils and around 50 teaching staff. Students are placed into one of three houses in their first year; Barrie, Haining and Laurie, which are named after influential pupils that attended the school. They place particular emphasis on their \\"Vision, Values and Aims,\\".The schools Vision is \\"to promote and value learning as a means of improving our chances of achieving success in school,our community and in our future lives\\".

Early life Francesco (Checco) Bonifacio was born September 7, 1912 in Pirano,\\"Beato Francesco Bonifacio, sacerdote e martire\\", Diocesi di Trieste Istria which was then part of Austria Hungary, later Italy, and is now part of Slovenia. He was the second of seven children born to Giovanni and Luigia Busdon Bonifacio. His father was a stoker on steamers sailing out of Trieste, which kept him away much of the time. His mother took a job as a cleaning lady to supplement their income. The family were devout Catholics. Francesco attended the local elementary school of Pirano and received religious education at the local parish of San Francesco where he served as an altar boy.  Seminarian In 1924, Bonifacio entered the seminary in Capodistria-Koper, where he earned the nickname of El Santin (the little Saint) for his obedience, meekness, service, and availability to his companions. On Christmas Eve 1931, his father died. The following year he entered the Central Theological Seminary of Gorizia. These were turbulent years for Italy: Fascism had already consolidated its political power and sought to reduce the influence of the Catholic Church in Italy. In 1934, a press campaign was mounted by the fascists against the local Church because of speech by Bishop Luigi Fogar. However, young Bonifacio was not particularly interested in politics. Priesthood On , Bonofacio was ordained as a deacon in Trieste by Archbishop Carlo Margotti of Gorizia and on , he was ordained a priest in the Trieste Cathedral of San Giusto. He celebrated his first service in his native Pirano church San Giorgio Dom on . A few months later he was assigned as vicar at Cittanova d'Istria, where he created the local section of the Azione Cattolica (Catholic Action). On Bishop of Trieste Antonio Santin appointed Bonofacio curate of Villa Gardossi or Crassizza (now Krasica), a small borough located in the Buiese between Buie and Grisignana. The community was made up of a few small villages, (Baredine, Punta, Lozzari, Buzzai, Gardossi, Monte Cini, Musolini, Stazia Loy, Costellaz, Braichi and Radani), and had a population of 1300 people, most of them peasants. His mother and younger brother join him there. The rectory had neither running water nor electricity; food was meager and consisted mainly of soup, polenta, and eggs.Pettiti, Gianpiero. \\"Beato Francesco Giovanni Bonifacio\\", Santi e beati, December 30, 2008 He quickly organized the Azione Cattolica movement and a choir in the parish. He taught religion at the local school and began a small library. Don Francesco shared what little food he had with the poorest of his parishioners. Not of robust health, he suffered from asthma, a persistent cough and chronic bronchial and lung problems. Nonetheless, his afternoons were devoted to parish visits. In all types of weather, he traveled the length and breadth of the valley, on foot or by bicycle, dispensing comfort and encouragement. Don Francesco was well-liked by the people. World War II War broke out in June 1940, but had very little effect in Istria until the Italian debacle of September 8, 1943. Components of the Italian and Yugoslav Communist Parties organized to seize control. The Villa Gardossi area with its forests and isolated houses, was an ideal location for the Partisan guerrillas. German troops arrived around mid- September occupying the key positions of Istria. Don Francesco continued his routine of service to his community, but faced this new situation with great energy and extreme courage. During a German Army cordon and Army search operation, he risked his life to recover and bury the bodies of fallen partisans. He prevented the Germans for setting a house on fire, because they believed it to be used to shelter partisans. He prevented a protest at the Fascist Headquarters in Buie after the murder of a peasant, and saved from a Partisan firing squad a man they believed to be a German informer. Youths who didn't want to be drafted into the new Italian Fascist Army or forced to join the Partisan forces found refuge at the rectory.\\"Don Francesco Bonafacio\\", Parish of San Gerolamo, Trieste After the war In May 1945 German and Italian forces were driven out of Istria by the Partisan Army. The region, was almost entirely annexed to Tito's new Communist Yugoslavia. The new regime saw the Catholic Church as potential enemies. New holidays were introduced to replace religious feast days. The new government discouraged people from attending Church, and positioned agents outside churches to note the names of those who did. Don Francesco was seen as a leader in the community and a threat to the new regime. He was informed by some loyal parishioner that some members of his congregation had embraced the new standards, and he was warned not to trust them. At this time Yugoslav communism was modeled on Soviet style, and along with the usual violence, they were also trained in the use of misinformation, propaganda and false accusations. He travelled to Triests to consult with his bishop who advised him to be cautious and to limit his activities to within the church, avoiding any public stance. Monsignor Santin also urged him to remain \\"true to [his] duties without being intimidated by anyone\\". Don Francesco was accused of being a ‚ÄúSubversive and an anti- communist‚Äù. He answered these false accusations by holding Action's meeting in the Church, with the doors wide open, so that everyone could observe what was said. Death A few days before his death, Don Francesco had been warned by some loyal parishioners that his life was in danger. He confided to fellow priest, Don Guido Bertuzzo, the Sicciole's Chaplain, that even talking on the streets had become very dangerous for him since he was under strict surveillance. He recommended to an activist parishioner that he \\"mark his arms\\" since he knew that the \\"Druses\\" (communists) were now cutting off the heads of their victims. Father Bonifacio was likely killed on , the same day he disappeared and his body was never recovered.Testa, Merko. \\"Don Francesco Bonifacio\\", Zenit, July 8, 2008 He was seen alive for the last time around 4 p.m. by Don Giuseppe Rocco, his confessor and the Chaplain of Peroi. A later reconstruction indicated that he was stopped on his way back from Gro≈ænjan by some \\"Popular Guards\\", beaten to death, and his body thrown into a foiba.\\"The Beatification of Don Bonifacio\\", Associazione Nazionale Venezia Giulia e DAlmazia, November 2008 Other unconfirmed versions stated that he was also reputedly physically abused, stoned, and eventually stabbed twice. When his brother went to ask for information to the local \\"Popular Militia\\" (Communist Police) he was arrested on accusation of spreading false and anticommunist propaganda. Shortly afterward the family moved to Italy. The fate of Father (Don) Francesco Bonifacio was not the only violence committed against the Catholic Church of the former Italian territories ceded to Yugoslavia in 1945. In June 1946, Trieste bishop Mons. Santin was stopped and beaten by communist activists while going to Koper/Capodistria, then part of his diocese, attending the Ceremony of Confirmation; his delegate Mons Giacomo Ukmar was also beaten on August 23, 1947, the same day as another priest Don Miro Bulesic was murdered; his throat was slit. On November 11, 1951 another Trieste bishop delegate Mons. Giorgio Bruni, was beaten when attending Confirmations in Carcaseon the bishop's behalf. Beatification The then Bishop of Trieste Antonio Santin, born in Rovigno now Rovinj in Croatia, first submitted the proposal for the beatification of Don Francesco Bonifacio back in 1957. Mons. Eugenio Ravignani, current Bishop of Trieste, wrote a report on the priest's murder on . He wrote that Don Francesco Bonifacio was murdered at the age of 34 on the evening of . For many years nothing was known until witnesses confirmed and shed light on what happened that night. All of the testimonies said that Bonifacio was beaten and thrown into a pit. Other accounts mention him being stoned, injured with a knife and shot.\\"Beatification set for 'Foibe' priest\\", Italy Magazine, August 20, 2008 Controversy The February 7, 2006 issued of Avvenire carried an article which stated that Don Luigi Rocco, who received a visit from Don Bonifacio in 1946 in Groznjan, said that the priest was thrown into the pit Martinesi in Groznjan.\\"Don Francesco Bonifacio\\", Avvenire, February 7, 2006 While Bonifacio's body may have been thrown into the foiba called Martines, this is uncertain because his remains were never found. It is also possible that his body was burned.Vigna, Marco. \\"The Priests Murdered in the Foibe Massacres\\", ‚ÄúComune di Pignataro, February 9, 2016 The peace treaty of Paris signed in 1947, when Istria was almost entirely ceded to Yugoslavia, is still an issue that marks the relations between Italy and the new states of the former Federation of Yugoslavia. The Foibe atrocities are a divisive subject in contemporary Italian politics. Right wing media accuse the left of attempting to downplay the massacres while focusing attention on crimes committed by the Fascists. Bonifacio and his martyrdom at the hands of Communists, has become an important symbol of the story of the foibe and the exodus of Italians from Istria. Famous Istrian priest Mons. Bozo Milanovic, author of many books on Istrian history and crimes committed against priests, wrote a book ‚ÄúIstra u dvadesetom stoljecu‚Äù (‚ÄúIstria in the twentieth century‚Äù, Pazin 1996). In this book he described the work of the ‚Äúcollege of priests St. Pavao for Istria‚Äù, 1946. He wrote that they discussed a ‚Äúsecretly missing Italian minister in Bujstina (‚Ä¶)‚Äù while Ivan Grah, minister in the Istrian villages of Sisan and Liznjan, in his book ‚ÄúIstarska crkva u ratnom vrihoru‚Äù (1943‚Äì1945) (Istrian Church in war winds), published in Pazin in 1992, described the crimes against Istrian priests but never mentioned Don Bonifacio. However, in the feuilleton Istarski Svecenici - Ratne i Poratne Zrtve (Istrian priests‚Äìwar and post-war victims), published in the monthly ‚ÄúLadonja‚Äù in August 2005, Ivan Grah wrote about Francesco Bonifacio. Since 1939 till his suffered death, he was at the head of the parish of Krasica in Bujstina. After the end of the war, the Yugo- Communist authorities could not bear him because he interfered too much with their ideological work. On September 10, 1946, came the news that in Bujstina they‚Äìthe communists- had a list of younger priests who had to be ‚Äúliquidated‚Äù by the Popular Guard. Don Bonifacio was first on the list, but he decided to carry on with his duties as a priest. The following day, September 11, in the evening, the Popular Guard was waiting for him as he returned home on foot from Groznjan and, after a crabbed discussion, he was coercively taken away. Since then, all traces of him have disappeared and the place of his death remaines unknown (...)‚Äù. The Communist writer, publicist and journalist Giacomo Scotti, an Italian Communist expatriate from Naples, in his book ‚ÄúCry from the foiba‚Äù (Rijeka 2008) does not mention the murder of Don Bonifacio or his body being thrown into a foiba. Giacomo Scotti a great expert on this topic in Croatia and Italy wrote: ‚ÄúAs soon as I started writing about the beatification of Don Bonifacio being held in Trieste and about the murder, I stated that this priest is not present on the list of foibe victims. The League of Anti-fascist Fighters told me that Don Bonifacio went missing in September 1946, and that there is no information on his murder or on his death in a pit. The murder of Don Bonifacio, said Tomo Ravnic for Javno.com, president of the SAB of the Istria County, throws shame on antifascist fighters. The beatification ceremony was held in the Trieste Cathedral of Saint Giusto on 4 October 2008 by Trieste Bishop‚Äôs Eugenio Ravignani; The Archbishop Angelo Amato, represented the Pontiff. In 2005 a Trieste square was named after Francesco Bonifacio.

He assumed that role in 2018 after previous employment as a financial analyst and a television financial news host. Kudlow began his career as a junior financial analyst at the New York Federal Reserve. He soon left government to work on Wall Street at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns as a financial analyst. In 1981, after previously volunteering and working for left-wing politicians and causes, Kudlow joined the administration of Ronald Reagan as associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget. After leaving the Reagan Administration during the second term, Kudlow returned to Wall Street and Bear Stearns, serving as the firm's chief economist from 1987 until 1994. During this time, he also advised the gubernatorial campaign of Christine Todd Whitman on economic issues. In the late 1990s, after a publicized battle with cocaine and alcohol addiction, Kudlow left Wall Street to become an economic media commentatorfirst with National Review, and later hosting several shows on CNBC. Kudlow returned to politics in 2018, serving as Gary Cohn's replacement at the National Economic Council. Early life and education Kudlow was born and raised in New Jersey, the son of Ruth (n√©e Grodnick) and Irving Howard Kudlow. His family is Jewish. Kudlow attended the Elisabeth Morrow School in Englewood, New Jersey until 6th grade. He then attended the Dwight-Englewood School through high school.\\"The Interview: Lawrence Kudlow\\", from The American Spectator, March 2001. \\"I remember that in this little prep school that I went to, the Dwight Englewood School in New Jersey, we had to say the Lord's Prayer in homeroom.\\" Kudlow graduated from University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, with a degree in history in 1969. Known as \\"Kuddles\\" to friends, he was a star on the tennis team, and a member of the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society at Rochester. Although Kudlow has only completed a degree in history (aside from his foreign policy coursework at Princeton), he claims that his particular history studies dealt heavily with economics themes, especially trade policy. In 1971, Kudlow enrolled at the master's program at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where he left before completing his degree. Career In 1970, while he was still a Democrat, Kudlow joined Americans for Democratic Action chair Joseph Duffey's \\"New Politics\\" senatorial campaign in Connecticut which also attracted an \\"A-list crowd of young Democrats,\\" including Yale University law student Bill Clinton, John Podesta, and Michael Medved, another future conservative. Duffey was a leading anti-war politician during the Vietnam war era. Duffey's campaign manager called Kudlow a \\"brilliant organizer.\\" In 1976, he worked on the U.S. Senate campaign of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, along with Tim Russert, against Conservative Party incumbent James L. Buckley, brother of William F. Buckley, Jr. Kudlow began his career as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, taking a position \\"as a junior economist in a job where a master's degree wasn't required.\\" He worked in the division of the Fed that handled open market operations. During the first term of the Reagan administration (1981‚Äì1985), Kudlow was associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a part of the Executive Office of the President. While he worked at the OMB, Kudlow was also an advisory committee member of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, more commonly known as Freddie Mac. In April 2005, New York Governor George Pataki included Kudlow in a six-member state tax commission. Kudlow's name was floated by Republicans as a potential Senate candidate in either Connecticut or New York in 2016. In October 2015, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, in an email to supporters, attacked Kudlow as \\"a champion of big corporations and big money\\" despite Kudlow's not announcing a run. In early December 2015, Jack Fowler of National Review created a 527 organization that encouraged Kudlow to run. = Director of the National Economic Council = Kudlow with Ivanka Trump in October 2018 In March 2018, Donald Trump appointed Kudlow to be Director of the National Economic Council, succeeding Gary Cohn. He assumed office on April 2, 2018. In April 2018, Kudlow said that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was untrustworthy. He dismissed CBO's estimate that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would increase the deficit by $1.3 trillion, saying, \\"Never believe the CBO. Very important: Never believe them. They're always wrong, especially with regard to tax cuts, which they never score properly.\\" All credible studies of the tax plan, whether by non-partisan organizations, Wall Street analysts, or right-leaning research organizations, showed that the tax plan would increase the deficit. In July 2018, Kudlow falsely asserted that \\"Even the CBO numbers show now that the entire $1.5 trillion tax cut is virtually paid for by higher revenues and better nominal GDP.\\" The CBO actually found that the tax cut reduces revenues and that deficits would increase by $1.9 trillion after accounting for macroeconomic feedback. Also in April, Kudlow alleged that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley had announced that the U.S. would soon sanction Russia due to \\"momentary confusion\\". After Haley contradicted Kudlow's claim, Kudlow called Haley to apologize. In April 2018, Kudlow stated, \\"the trouble I had with the Obama [stimulus] program was it was all spending.\\" However, about 35% of the stimulus was tax relief, including a $116 billion income tax cut. As Trump celebrated the six-month anniversary of the tax cut on June 29, 2018, Kudlow falsely asserted that the tax cut was generating such growth that \\"the deficit, which was one of the other criticisms, is coming down ‚Äì and it's coming down rapidly.\\" Kevin Hassett, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, noted days earlier that the deficit was \\"skyrocketing\\", which is consistent with the analysis of every reputable budget analyst. Kudlow later asserted he was referring to future deficits, although every credible budget forecast indicates increasing deficits in coming years, made worse by the Trump tax cut if not offset by major spending cuts. Barring such spending cuts, the CBO projected the tax cut would add $1.27 trillion in deficits over the next decade, even after considering any economic growth the tax cut might generate. Kudlow asserted on June 29, 2018, that \\"capital investment, you know, for new jobs and better careers, [is] flowing in from all corners of the world,\\" though foreign direct investment into America had declined significantly during the Trump presidency through August 2019. On June 29, 2018, Kudlow stated, \\"This is now, the USA, according to the OECD, the hottest economy in the world.\\" However, this was not a new phenomenon under the Trump presidency, as by 2015 the American GDP growth rate had been almost twice that of other industrialized countries since 2008, and by 2015 America had created as many jobs than all other industrialized countries combined since 2010. Kudlow also asserted: \\"They've been saying that all along, OK? We could never get to 3% growth... It couldn't be done, they say. It's being done.\\" However, analysts have actually said that 3% sustained growth was unlikely, rather than periodic quarters of growth of 3% or more. From 2009 through 2016, GDP growth exceeded 3% in eight quarters ‚Äì including 5.1% and 4.9% in consecutive quarters of 2014 ‚Äì yet it did not sustain 3% or more for any full year. Although GDP exceeded 3% in two consecutive quarters of 2017, the average growth was 2.4% through Trump's first five quarters in office. The final figure for first quarter 2018 GDP growth was released the day before Kudlow spoke ‚Äì coming in at 2.0%. Three months later GDP for the second quarter of 2018 was announced at an annual growth rate of 4.1%. On August 28, 2018, after Trump accused Google of rigging search results to show information biased against him, Kudlow told reporters \\"we're taking a look at\\" regulating Google. Steven Mnuchin, Kudlow and Sajid Javid at 11 Downing Street, 2019 In November 2018, eleven months after the Trump tax cut, Kudlow stated, ‚Äúthe tax cut has paid for itself already barely through the first calendar year,‚Äù although data released weeks later showed federal revenue had declined and the deficit had increased during calendar 2018. During the 2018-2019 partial federal government shutdown, approximately 420,000 federal workers deemed \\"essential\\" were compelled to continue working without pay. On the 34th day of the shutdown, Kudlow asserted that such workers were \\"volunteering\\" to work for their love of the country and \\"presumably their allegiance to President Trump.\\" In the summer of 2019, Kudlow twice asserted that the proposed United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement would increase GDP by half a percentage point and job creation by 180,000 per year after ratification. The International Trade Commission analysis Kudlow was apparently referencing actually found the agreement would increase GDP by 0.35 point and jobs by 176,000 after six years following ratification. Analysis cited by another study from the Congressional Research Service found the agreement would not have a measurable effect on jobs, wages, or overall economic growth. On February 25, 2020, as a coronavirus pandemic was emerging as a global pandemic, Kudlow stated, \\"We have contained this, I won't say airtight but pretty close to airtight.\\" In June 2020, amid the George Floyd protests against racism and police brutality, Kudlow said, \\"I don‚Äôt believe there is systemic racism in the U.S.\\" = Financial industry = In 1987, Kudlow was hired by Bear Stearns as its chief economist and senior managing director. Kudlow also served as an economic counsel to A. B. Laffer & Associates, the San Diego, California, company owned by Arthur Laffer, a major supply-side economist and promoter of the \\"Laffer curve\\", an economic measure of the relationship between tax levels and government revenue. Kudlow was fired from Bear Stearns in the mid-1990s due to his cocaine addiction. He was a member of the board of directors of Empower America, a supply-side economics organization founded in 1993 and merged in 2004 with the Citizens for a Sound Economy to form FreedomWorks. Kudlow is also a founding member of the Board of Advisors for the Independent Institute and consulting chief economist for American Skandia Life Assurance, Inc., in Connecticut, a subsidiary of insurance giant Prudential Financial. = Media = Kudlow became Economics Editor at National Review Online (NRO) in May 2001. In December 2007, NRO published a Kudlow article entitled Bush Boom Continues, in which he asserted the economy would continue to expand for years to come. The Great Recession, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, began that month. Kudlow served as one of a rotating set of hosts on the CNBC show America Now, which began airing in November 2001. In May 2002, that show was renamed Kudlow & Cramer, and Kudlow and Jim Cramer became the permanent hosts. In January 2005, Cramer left to host his own show, Mad Money, and the program's name was changed the next month to Kudlow & Company. The program went on hiatus in October 2008, and returned in January 2009 as The Kudlow Report, which ended its run on CNBC in March 2014. Kudlow added co-anchor of CNBC's The Call to his responsibilities in late 2008. Kudlow is also a regular guest on Squawk Box. He has contributed to CNBC.com on MSN. Starting in 2004, he also appeared on The John Batchelor Show as a co-host on Tuesdays and as a substitute, until leaving those duties to become an economics advisor to President Trump. In March 2006, Kudlow started to host a talk radio show on politics and economics on WABC as The Larry Kudlow Show aired on Saturday mornings from 10am to 1pm ET and via nationwide syndication in the US starting June 5, 2010. He started a blog named Kudlow's Money Politic$ in October 2004. He has also contributed to the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Times, the Cato Journal of the Cato Institute, and the City Journal of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, as well as the television show The McLaughlin Group, and has appeared as a guest on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer and on Wall Street Week.  Political views  Kudlow in 1981 = Economy = A self-described \\"Reagan supply-sider\\", Kudlow is known for his support for tax cuts and deregulation. According to The Economist, Kudlow is \\"the quintessential member of the Republican Party's business wing\\". Kudlow has no formal economics qualifications. In 1993, Kudlow claimed that Bill Clinton's tax increases would dampen economic growth. When the economy boomed in the late-1990s, Kudlow credited it to tax cuts enacted during the Reagan administration (1981‚Äì1989). He has also advocated that employees be compelled to make greater contributions to their pension and medical costs, suggesting that these expenses are an undue burden on businesses and defends high executive compensation as a manifestation of market forces and opposes most forms of government regulation. In general, he has described himself as a supply-side economist, arguing that reducing tax rates will encourage economic growth and ultimately increase tax revenue. He has often argued that economic growth will clear deficits, while acknowledging the limits of growth. He has also advocated wide ownership of stocks and has frequently spoken of a broad \\"investor class\\" that includes most Americans. Kudlow was a strong advocate of George W. Bush's substantial tax cuts, and argued that the tax cuts would lead to an economic boom of equal magnitude. After the implementation of the Bush tax cuts, Kudlow insisted year after year that the economy was in the middle of a \\"Bush boom\\", and chastised other commentators for failing to realize it. Kudlow firmly denied that the United States would enter a recession in 2007, or that it was in the midst of a recession in early to mid-2008. In December 2007, he wrote: \\"The recession debate is over. It's not gonna happen. Time to move on. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that's a minimum). The Bush boom is alive and well. It's finishing up its sixth splendid year with many more years to come\\". In a May 2008 column entitled \\"'R' is for 'Right'\\", Kudlow wrote: \\"President George W. Bush may turn out to be the top economic forecaster in the country\\". By July 2008, Kudlow continued to deny that the economy was looking poor, insisting that \\"We are in a mental recession, not an actual recession\\". Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, creating a full-blown international banking crisis. As George W. Bush took office in January 2001, America was in the fourth consecutive fiscal year of federal budget surpluses and the CBO projected increasing surpluses in each year through 2010, totaling over $5 trillion. Days before Bush signed his tax cut plan in June, Kudlow predicted it would cause future budget surpluses to rise. Instead, there were budget deficits in every fiscal year of the Bush administration. In their 2015 book Superforecasting, University of Pennsylvania political scientist Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner refer to Kudlow as a \\"consistently wrong\\" pundit, and use Kudlow's long record of failed predictions to clarify common mistakes that poor forecasters make. Kudlow supported free trade prior to his White House appointment. As recently as three weeks before taking office, he co-authored with Stephen Moore and Art Laffer an opinion piece entitled Tariffs Are Taxes., in which he argued against the proposed Trump tariffs. However, upon his appointment, he said that he was \\"in accord\\" with President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, apparently as a \\"negotiating tactic\\". Kudlow is not known as a deficit hawk. = Politics = On June 26, 2002, in a commentary in NRO titled \\"Taking Back the Market ‚Äì By Force\\", Kudlow called for the United States to attack Iraq, stating that Saddam Hussein had \\"weapons of mass destruction at his disposal\\" and that \\"a lack of decisive follow-through in the global war on terrorism is the single biggest problem facing the stock market and the nation today\\". In an open letter dated February 12, 2003, he endorsed George W. Bush's policies on economic growth and jobs. In 2016, Kudlow endorsed Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump. He later defended Executive Order 13767, Trump's plan to build a wall along the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, declaring it was necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the United States, the United States was at war with ISIS and Trump was going to do what was necessary to protect the country. He also penned an article for RealClearPolitics advocating for conservative unity in the election and asking his conservative peers to stop criticizing Trump and instead help him become a stronger candidate. After the 2018 G7 Summit in Charlevoix, Canada, he criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a candid interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, saying that Trudeau had \\"stabbed us in the back\\". Personal life Kudlow has been married three times: In 1974, he married Nancy Ellen Gerstein, an editor in The New Yorker magazine's fiction department, the marriage lasted about a year. In 1981, he married Susan (Cullman) Sicher, whose grandfather was businessman Joseph Cullman and whose great-grandfather was businessman Lyman G. Bloomingdale. The Washington wedding was presided over by Federal judge John Sirica. In 1986, he married Judith \\"Judy\\" Pond, a painter and Montana native. In the mid-1990s, Kudlow left Bear Stearns and entered a 12-step program in order to deal with his addictions to cocaine and alcohol. He subsequently converted to Catholicism under the guidance of Father C. John McCloskey III. Kudlow is a member of the Catholic Advisory Board of the Ave Maria Mutual Funds. He served as a member of the Fordham University Board of Trustees and is on the advisory committee of the Kemp Institute at the Pepperdine University School of Public Policy. On June 11, 2018, Kudlow suffered what the White House referred to as a \\"very mild\\" heart attack. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders noted that Kudlow had been admitted to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, and that he was \\"doing well\\", and expects a \\"full and speedy recovery\\". The incident took place on the same day President Trump was set to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Singapore for the American summit with North Korea. On June 13, Kudlow was discharged from the hospital.

Founded around 814 BC as a colony of Tyre, within centuries it became the center of the Carthaginian Empire, a major commercial and maritime power that dominated the western Mediterranean until the mid third century BC. After gaining independence in the seventh century BC, Carthage gradually expanded its economic and political hegemony across northwest Africa, Iberia, and the major islands of the western Mediterranean.Adrian Goldsworthy, The Fall of Carthage, Ch. 1: The Opposing Sides. By 300 BC, it became one of the largest and richest cities in antiquity, with its colonies, vassals, and satellite states constituting more territory than any other polity in the region. Carthage's wealth and power rested primarily on its strategic location, which provided access to abundant fertile land and major trade routes. Its vast mercantile network, which extended as far as west Africa and northern Europe, provided an array of commodities from all over the ancient world, as well as lucrative exports of agricultural goods and manufactured products. This commercial empire was secured by one of the largest and most powerful navies in the ancient Mediterranean, and an army largely comprised of foreign mercenaries and auxiliaries. As the dominant power of the western Mediterranean, Carthage inevitably came into conflict with many neighbors and rivals, from the indigenous Berbers of North Africa to the nascent Roman Republic. Following a centuries-long series of conflicts with the Sicilian Greeks, its growing competition with Rome culminated in the Punic Wars (264‚Äì146 BC), which saw some of the largest and most sophisticated battles in antiquity, and nearly led to Rome's destruction. In 146 BC, after the third and final Punic War, the Romans destroyed Carthage and established a new city in its place a century later. All remaining Carthaginian dependencies, as well as other Phoenician city-states, came under Roman rule by the first century AD. Notwithstanding the cosmopolitan character of its empire, Carthage's culture and identity remained staunchly Phoenician, or Punic. Like other Phoenician people, its society was heavily urbanised and oriented towards seafaring and trade, reflected in part by its more famous innovations and technical achievements, including serial production, uncolored glass, the threshing board, and the cothon. The Carthaginians became distinguished for their commercial ambitions and unique system of government, which combined elements of democracy, oligarchy, and republicanism, including modern examples of checks and balances. Despite having been one of the most influential civilizations in the ancient world, Carthage is mostly remembered for its long and bitter conflict with Rome, which threatened the rise of the Roman Republic and almost changed the course of Western civilization. Due to the destruction of virtually all Carthaginian texts after the Third Punic War, much of what is known about its civilization comes from Roman and Greek authors, many of whom wrote during or after the Punic Wars, and to varying degrees were shaped by the hostilities. Popular and scholarly attitudes towards Carthage reflected the prevailing Greco-Roman view, though archaeological research since the late 19th century has helped shed more light and nuance on Carthaginian civilization.  Etymology  The name Carthage /Ààk…ëÀêrŒ∏…™d í/ is the Early Modern anglicisation of Middle French Carthage /kar.ta í/, from Latin 'CarthƒÅg≈ç' and 'KarthƒÅg≈ç' (cf. Greek Karkhƒìd≈çn (ŒöŒ±œÅœáŒ∑Œ¥œéŒΩ) and Etruscan *CarŒ∏aza) from the Punic 'qrt-·∏•d≈°t' (ê§íê§ìê§ï ê§áê§Éê§îê§ï‚Äé) \\"new city\\". Punic, which is often used synonymously with Carthaginian, derives from the Latin poenus and punicus, based on the Ancient Greek word Œ¶Œø·øñŒΩŒπŒæ (Phoinix), pl. Œ¶ŒøŒØŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒµœÇ (Phoinikes), an exonym used to describe the Canaanite port towns with which the Greeks traded. Latin later borrowed the Greek term a second time as phoenix, pl. phoenices. Both Punic and Phoenician were used by the Romans and Greeks to refer to Phoenicians across the Mediterranean; modern scholars use the term Punic exclusively for Phoenicians in the western Mediterranean, such as the Carthaginians. Specific Punic groups are often referred to with hyphenated terms, like \\"Siculo-Punic\\" for Phoenicians in Sicily or \\"Sardo-Punic\\" for those in Sardinia. Ancient Greek authors sometimes referred to the Punic inhabitants of North Africa ('Libya') as 'Liby-Phoenicians'. It is unclear what term, if any, the Carthaginians used to refer to themselves. The Phoenician homeland in the Levant was natively known as ' (P≈´t) and its people as the ' (P≈çnnim). Ancient Egyptians accounts suggest the people from the region identified as Kenaani or Kinaani, equivalent to Canaanite. A passage from Augustine has often been interpreted as indicating that the Punic-speakers in North Africa called themselves Chanani (Canaanites),Augustine Unfinished Commentary on Paul's Letter to the Romans 13 but it has recently been argued that this is a misreading. Numismatic evidence from Sicily shows that some western Phoenicians made use of the term Phoinix.  Sources  Compared to contemporaneous civilizations such as Rome and Greece, far less is known about Carthage, as most indigenous records were lost in the wholesale destruction of the city after the Third Punic War. Sources of knowledge are limited to ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, Punic inscriptions on monuments and buildings, and archaeological findings of Carthage's material culture. The majority of available primary sources about Carthage were written by Greek and Roman historians, most notably Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These authors came from cultures that were nearly always in competition with Carthage; the Greeks with respect to Sicily,Herodotus, V2. pp 165‚Äì7 and the Romans over dominance of the western Mediterranean.Polybius, World History: 1.7‚Äì1.60 Inevitably, foreign accounts of Carthage usually reflect significant bias, especially those written during or after the Punic Wars, when the interpretatio Romana perpetuated a \\"malicious and distorted view\\".Pedro Barcel√≥, THE PERCEPTION OF CARTHAGE IN CLASSICAL GREEK HISTORIOGRAPHY, Acta Classica, Vol. 37 (1994), pp. 1-14, Classical Association of South Africa, http://www.jstor.org/stable/24594338, p. 1. Excavations of ancient Carthaginian sites since the late 19th century have brought to light more material evidence that either contradict or confirm aspects of the traditional picture of Carthage; however, many of these findings remain ambiguous. History =Foundation legends= The specific date, circumstances, and motivations concerning Carthage's founding are unknown. All surviving accounts of the city's origins come from Latin and Greek literature, which are generally legendary in nature but may have some basis in fact.Pedro Barcel√≥, THE PERCEPTION OF CARTHAGE IN CLASSICAL GREEK HISTORIOGRAPHY, Acta Classica, Vol. 37 (1994), pp. 1-14, Classical Association of South Africa, www.jstor.org/stable/24594338, p. 3. The standard foundation myth across all sources is that the city was founded by colonists from the ancient Phoenician city-state of Tyre, led by its exiled princess Dido (also known as Queen Elissa or Alissar). Elissa's brother, Pygmalion (Phoenician: Pummayaton) had murdered her husband, the high priest of the city, and taken power as a tyrant. Elissa and her allies escape his reign and establish Carthage, which becomes a prosperous city under her rule as queen. The Roman historian Justin, writing in the second century AD, provides an account of the city's founding based on the earlier work of Trogus. Princess Elissa is the daughter of King Belus II of Tyre, who upon his death bequeaths the throne jointly to her and her brother Pygmalion. After cheating his sister out of her share of political power, Pygmalion murders her husband Acerbas (Phoenician: Zakarbaal), also known as Sychaeus, the High Priest of Melqart, whose wealth and power he covets. Before her tyrannical brother can take her late husband's wealth, Elissa immediately flees with her followers to establish a new city abroad. Upon landing in North Africa, she is greeted by the local Berber chieftain, Iarbas (also called Hiarbas) who promises to cede as much land as could be covered by a single ox hide. With her characteristic cleverness, Dido cuts the hide into very thin strips and lays them end to end until they encircle the entire hill of Byrsa. While digging to set the foundation of their new settlement, the Tyrians discover the head of an ox, an omen that the city would be wealthy \\"but laborious and always enslaved\\". In response they move the site of the city elsewhere, where the head of a horse is found, which in Phoenician culture is a symbol of courage and conquest. The horse foretells where Dido's new city will rise, becoming the emblem of Carthage, derived from the Phoenician Qart-Hadasht, meaning \\"New City\\". Queen Dido, by Claude- Augustin Cayot (1667‚Äì1722)alt=left The city's wealth and prosperity attracts both Phoenicians from nearby Utica and the indigenous Libyans, whose king Iarbas now seeks Elissa's hand in marriage. Threatened with war should she refuse, and also loyal to the memory of her deceased husband, the queen orders a funeral pyre to be built, where she commits suicide by stabbing herself with a sword. She is thereafter worshiped as a goddess by the people of Carthage, who are described as brave in battle but prone to the \\"cruel religious ceremony\\" of human sacrifice, even of children, whenever they seek divine relief from troubles of any kind. Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid‚Äîwritten over a century after the Third Punic War‚Äîtells the mythical story of the Trojan hero Aeneas and his journey towards founding Rome, inextricably tying together the founding myths, and ultimate fates, of both Rome and Carthage. Its introduction begins by mentioning \\"an ancient city\\" that many readers likely assumed was Rome or Troy,Ben Kiernan, The First Genocide: Carthage, 146 BC, DIOGENES 203: 27-39, ISSN 0392-1921, p. 34. but goes on to describe it as a place \\"held by colonists from Tyre, opposite Italy . .. a city of great wealth and ruthless in the pursuit of war. Its name was Carthage, and Juno is said to have loved it more than any other place ... But she had heard that there was rising from the blood of Troy a race of men who in days to come would overthrow this Tyrian citadel ... [and] sack the land of Libya.\\" Virgil describes Queen Elissa‚Äîfor whom he uses the ancient Greek name, Dido, meaning \\"beloved\\"‚Äîas an esteemed, clever, but ultimately tragic character. As in other legends, the impetus for her escape is her tyrannical brother Pygmalion, whose secret murder of her husband is revealed to her in a dream. Cleverly exploiting her brother's greed, Dido tricks Pygmalion into supporting her journey to find and bring back riches for him. Through this ruse she sets sail with gold and allies secretly in search of a new home. As in Justin's account, upon landing in North Africa, Dido is greeted by Iarbas, and after he offers as much land as could be covered by a single ox hide, she cuts the hide into very thin strips and encircles all of Byrsa. While digging to set the foundation of their new settlement, the Tyrians discover the head of a horse, which in Phoenician culture is a symbol of courage and conquest. The horse foretells where Dido's new city will rise, becoming the emblem of the \\"New City\\" Carthage. In just seven years since their exodus from Tyre, the Carthaginians build a successful kingdom under Dido's rule. She is adored by her subjects and presented with a festival of praise. Virgil portrays her character as even more noble when she offers asylum to Aeneas and his men, who had recently escaped from Troy. The two fall in love during a hunting expedition, and Dido comes to believe they will marry. Jupiter sends a spirit in the form of the messenger god, Mercury, to remind Aeneas that his mission is not to stay in Carthage with his new-found love Dido, but to sail to Italy to found Rome. The Trojan departs, leaving Dido so heartbroken that she commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a funeral pyre with his sword. As she lies dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas' people and her own, proclaiming \\"rise up from my bones, avenging spirit\\" in an invocation of Hannibal.4.625, trans. Fitzgerald. Aeneas sees the smoke from the pyre as he sails away, and though he does not know the fate of Dido, he identifies it as a bad omen. Ultimately, he goes on to found the Roman Kingdom, the predecessor of the Roman Empire. Like Justin, Virgil's story essentially conveys Rome's attitude towards Carthage, as exemplified by Cato the Elder's famous utterance, \\"Carthago delenda est\\"‚Äî\\"Carthage must be destroyed\\".Carthage and the Carthaginians, R Bosworth Smithp16 In essence, Rome and Carthage were fated for conflict: Aeneas chose Rome over Dido, eliciting her dying curse upon his Roman descendants, and thus providing a mythical, fatalistic backdrop for a century of bitter conflict between Rome and Carthage. These stories typify the Roman attitude towards Carthage: a level of grudging respect and acknowledgement of their bravery, prosperity, and even their city's seniority to Rome, along with derision of their cruelty, deviousness, and decadence, as exemplified by their practice of human sacrifice. =Settlement as Tyrian colony (c. 814 BC)= To facilitate their commercial ventures, the Phoenicians established numerous colonies and trading posts along the coasts of the Mediterranean. Organized in fiercely independent city-states, the Phoenicians lacked the numbers or even the desire to expand overseas; most colonies had fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, and only a few, including Carthage, would grow larger. Motives for colonization were usually practical, such as seeking safe harbors for their merchant fleets, maintaining a monopoly on an area's natural resources, satisfying the demand for trade goods, and finding areas where they could trade freely without outside interference. Over time many Phoenicians also sought to escape their tributary obligations to foreign powers that had subjugated the Phoenician homeland. Another motivating factor was competition with the Greeks, who became a nascent maritime power and began establishing colonies across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Ancient Carthaginian funerary art: sarcophagus of a priest, showing a bearded man with his hand raised. Louvre, Paris The first Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean grew up on the two paths to Iberia's mineral wealth: along the northwest African coast and on Sicily, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands. As the largest and wealthiest city-state among the Phoenicians, Tyre led the way in settling or controlling coastal areas. Strabo claims that the Tyrians alone founded three hundred colonies on the west African coast; though clearly an exaggeration, many colonies did arise in Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Iberia, and to a much lesser extent, on the arid coast of Libya. They were usually established as trading stations at intervals of about 30 to 50 kilometres along the African coast.Picard, Life and Death of Carthage (1969) at 18, and at 27: 30 km being \\"a good day's sailing\\". By the time they gained a foothold in Africa, the Phoenicians were already present in Cyprus, Crete, Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and Sicily, as well as on the European mainland, in what are today Genoa and Marseilles. Foreshadowing the later Sicilian Wars, settlements in Crete and Sicily continually clashed with the Greeks, and Phoenician control over all of Sicily was brief. Nearly all these areas would come under the leadership and protection of Carthage, which eventually founded cities of its own, especially after the decline of Tyre and Sidon. The site of Carthage was likely chosen by the Tyrians for several reasons. It was located in the central shore of the Gulf of Tunis, which gave it access to the Mediterranean sea while shielding it from the region's infamously violent storms. It was also close to the strategically vital Strait of Sicily, a key bottleneck for maritime trade between the east and west. The terrain proved as invaluable as the geography. The city was built on a hilly, triangular peninsula backed by the Lake of Tunis, which provided abundant supplies of fish and a place for safe harbor. The peninsula was connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land, which combined with the rough surrounding terrain, made the city easily defensible; a citadel was built on Byrsa, a low hill overlooking the sea. Finally, Carthage would be conduit of two major trade routes: one between the Tyrian colony of Cadiz in southern Spain, which supplied raw materials for manufacturing in Tyre, and the other between North Africa and the northern Mediterranean, namely Sicily, Italy, and Greece.Warmington, Carthage (1960, 1964) at . = Independence, expansion and hegemony (c. 650‚Äì264 BC) = In contrast to most Phoenician colonies, Carthage grew larger and more quickly thanks to its combination of favorable climate, arable land, and lucrative trade routes. Within just one century of its founding, its population rose to 30,000. Meanwhile, its mother city, which for centuries was the preeminent economic and political center of Phoenician, saw its status begin to wane in the seventh century BC, following a succession of sieges by the Babylonians. By this time, its Carthaginian colony had become immensely wealthy from its strategic location and extensive trade network. Unlike many other Phoenician city-states and dependencies, Carthage grew prosperous not only from maritime commerce but from its proximity to fertile agricultural land and rich mineral deposits. As the main hub for trade between Africa and the rest of the ancient world, it also provided a myriad of rare and luxurious goods, including terracotta figurines and masks, jewelry, delicately carved ivories, ostrich eggs, and a variety of foods and wine.An imagined rendition of ancient Carthage. The city's strategic location and favorable geography were key to its rise. (Note the fortified hill of Byrsa and the Lake of Tunis in the background.) Carthage's growing economic prominence coincided with a nascent national identity. Although Carthaginians remained staunchly Phoenician in their customs and faith, by at least the seventh century BC, they had developed a distinct Punic culture infused with local influences.Lancel, Serge, Carthage A History, pp 81‚Äì83 Certain deities became more prominent in the Carthaginian pantheon than in Phoenicia; into the fifth century BC, the Carthaginians were worshiping Greek deities such as Demeter. Carthage may have also retained religious practices that had long fallen out of favor in Tyre, such as child sacrifice. Similarly, it spoke its own Punic dialect of Phoenician, which also reflected contributions by neighboring peoples. These trends most likely precipitated the colony's emergence as an independent polity. Though the specific date and circumstances are unknown, Carthage most likely became independent around 650 BC, when it embarked on its own colonization efforts across the western Mediterranean. It nonetheless maintained amicable cultural, political, and commercial ties with its founding city and the Phoenician homeland; it continued to receive migrants from Tyre, and for a time continued the practice of sending annual tribute to Tyre's temple of Melqart, albeit at irregular intervals. By the sixth century BC, Tyre's power declined further still after its voluntary submission to the Persian king Cambyses ( BC), which resulted in the incorporation of the Phoenician homeland into the Persian empire. Lacking sufficient naval strength, Cambyses sought Tyrian assistance for his planned conquest of Carthage, which may indicate that the former Tyrian colony had become wealthy enough to warrant a long and difficult expedition. Herodotus claims that the Tyrians refused to cooperate due to their affinity for Carthage, causing the Persian king to abort his campaign. Though it escaped reprisal, Tyre's status as Phoenicia's leading city was significantly circumscribed; its rival, Sidon, subsequently garnered more support from the Persians. However, it too remained subjugated, leading the way for Carthage to fill the vacuum as the leading Phoenician political power.  Formation and characteristic of the empire  Although the Carthaginians retained the traditional Phoenician affinity for maritime trade and commerce, they were distinguished by their imperial and military ambitions: whereas the Phoenician city-states rarely engaged in territorial conquest, Carthage became an expansionist power, driven by its desire to access new sources of wealth and trade. It is unknown what factors influenced the citizens of Carthage, unlike those of other Phoenician colonies, to create an economic and political hegemony; the nearby city of Utica was far older and enjoyed the same geographical and political advantages, but never embarked on hegemonic conquest, instead coming under Carthaginian influence. One theory is that Babylonian and Persian domination of the Phoenician homeland produced refugees that swelled Carthage's population and transferred the culture, wealth, and traditions of Tyre to Carthage.Baker, G.P, Hannibal, pp 10‚Äì11 The threat to the Phoenician trade monopoly‚Äîby Etruscan and Greek competition in the west, and through foreign subjugation of its homeland in the east‚Äîalso created the conditions for Carthage to consolidate its power and further its commercial interests. Another contributing factor may have been domestic politics: while little is known of Carthage's government and leadership prior to the third century BCE, the reign of Mago (c. 550‚Äì530), and the political dominance of the Magonid family in subsequent decades, precipitated Carthage's rise as a hegemonic power. Justin states that Mago, who was also general of the army, was the first Carthaginian leader to \\"[set] in order the military system\\", which may have entailed the introduction of new military strategies and technologies.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 129. He is also credited with initiating, or at least expanding, the practice of recruiting subject peoples and mercenaries, as Carthage's population was too small to secure and defend its scattered colonies. Libyans, Iberians, Sardinians, and Corsicans were soon enlisted for the Magonid's expansionist campaigns across the region.Warmington, Carthage (1960; 2d ed. 1969) at 45 (quote), 52 (the enlisted). By the beginning of the fourth century BC, the Carthaginians had become the \\"superior power\\" of the western Mediterranean, and would remain so for roughly the next three centuries.Markoe 2000, p.56 Carthage took control of all nearby Phoenician colonies, including Hadrumetum, Utica, Hippo Diarrhytus and Kerkouane; subjugated many neighboring Libyan tribes, and occupied coastal North Africa from Morocco to western Libya. It held Sardinia, Malta, the Balearic Islands, and the western half of Sicily, where coastal fortresses such as Motya and Lilybaeum secured their possessions. The Iberian Peninsula, which was rich in precious metals, saw some of the largest and most important Carthaginian settlements outside North Africa, though the degree of political influence before the conquest by Hamilcar Barca (237‚Äì228 BC) is disputed. Carthage's growing wealth and power, along with the foreign subjugation of the Phoenician homeland, led to its supplanting of Sidon as the supreme Phoenician city state.

Museum of Puig des Molins in Ibiza, Spain.Carthage's empire was largely informal and multifaceted, consisting of varying levels of control exercised in equally variable ways. It established new colonies, repopulated and reinforced older ones, formed defensive pacts with other Phoenician city states, and acquired territories directly by conquest. While some Phoenician colonies willingly submitted to Carthage, paying tribute and giving up their foreign policy, others in Iberia and Sardinia resisted Carthaginian efforts. Whereas other Phoenician cities never exercised actual control of the colonies, the Carthaginians appointed magistrates to directly control their own (a policy that would lead to a number of Iberian towns siding with the Romans during the Punic Wars). In many other instances, Carthage's hegemony was established through treaties, alliances, tributary obligations, and other such arrangements. It had elements of the Delian League led by Athens (allies shared funding and manpower for defense), the Spartan Kingdom (subject peoples serving as serfs for the Punic elite and state) and, to a lesser extent, the Roman Republic (allies contributing manpower and tribute for Rome's war machine). In 509 BC, Carthage and Rome signed the first of several treaties demarcating their respective influence and commercial activities. This is the first textual source demonstrating Carthaginian control over Sicily and Sardinia. The treaty also conveys the extent to which Carthage was, at the very least, on equal terms with Rome, whose influence was limited to parts of central and southern Italy. Carthaginian dominance of the sea reflected not only its Phoenician heritage, but an approach to empire-building that differed greatly from Rome. Carthage emphasized maritime trade over territorial expansion, and accordingly focused its settlements and influence on coastal areas while investing more on its navy. For similar reasons, its ambitions were more commercial than imperial, which is why its empire took the form of a hegemony based on treaties and political arrangements more than conquest. By contrast, the Romans focused on expanding and consolidating their control over the rest of mainland Italy, and would aim to extend its control well beyond its homeland. These differences would prove key in the conduct and trajectory of the later Punic Wars. By the third century BC, Carthage was the center of a sprawling network of colonies and client states. It controlled more territory than the Roman Republic, and became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the Mediterranean, with a quarter of a million inhabitants. = Conflict with the Greeks (580‚Äì265 BC) = Unlike the existential conflict of the later Punic Wars with Rome, the conflict between Carthage and the Greeks centered on economic concerns, as each side sought to advance their own commercial interests and influence by controlling key trade routes. For centuries, the Phoenician and Greek city-states had embarked on maritime trade and colonization across the Mediterranean. While the Phoenicians were initially dominant, Greek competition increasingly undermined their monopoly. Both sides had begun establishing colonies, trading posts, and commercial relations in the western Mediterranean roughly contemporaneously, between the ninth and eighth centuries. Phoenician and Greek settlements, the increased presence of both peoples led to mounting tensions and ultimately open conflict, especially in Sicily. First Sicilian War (480 BC) 284x284px Carthage's economic successes, buoyed by its vast maritime trade network, led to the development of a powerful navy to protect and secure vital shipping lanes. Its hegemony brought it into increasing conflict with the Greeks of Syracuse, who also sought control of central Mediterranean. Founded in the mid seventh century BC, Syracuse had risen to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful Greek city states, and the preeminent Greek polity in the region. The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the main arena on which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large, centrally-located island, each establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coasts; battles raged between these settlements for centuries, with neither side ever having total, long-term control over the island. In 480 BC, Gelo, the tyrant of Syracuse, attempted to unite the island under his rule with the backing of other Greek city-states. Threatened by the potential power of a united Sicily, Carthage intervened militarily, led by King Hamilcar of the Magonid dynasty. Traditional accounts, including by Herodotus and Diodorus, number Hamilcar's army at around 300,000; though likely exaggerated, it was likely of formidable strength. While sailing to Sicily, Hamilcar suffered losses due to poor weather. Landing at Panormus (modern-day Palermo), he spent three days reorganizing his forces and repairing his battered fleet. The Carthaginians marched along the coast to Himera, making camp before engaging in battle against the forces of Syracuse and its ally Agrigentum. The Greeks won a decisive victory, inflicting heavy losses on the Carthaginians, including their leader Hamilcar, who was either killed during the battle or committed suicide in shame. As a result, the Carthaginian nobility sued for peace. The conflict proved to be a major turning point for Carthage. Though it would retain some presence in Sicily, most of the island would remain in Greek (and later Roman) hands. The Carthaginians would never again expand their territory or sphere of influence on the island to any meaningful degree, instead turning their attention to securing or increasing their hold in North Africa and Iberia. The death of King Hamilcar and the disastrous conduct of the war also prompted political reforms that established an oligarchic republic. Carthage would henceforth constrain its rulers through assemblies of both nobles and the common people.  Second Sicilian War (410‚Äì404 BC)  Tarentum, in southern Italy, during the occupation by Hannibal (c. 212‚Äì209 BC).

By 410 BC, Carthage had recovered from its serious defeats in Sicily. It had conquered much of modern- day Tunisia and founded new colonies across northern Africa. It also extended its reach well beyond the Mediterranean; Hanno the Navigator journeyed down the West African coast,Moscati 2001, p.640 and Himilco the Navigator had explored the European Atlantic coast. Expeditions were also led into Morocco and Senegal, as well as the Atlantic. The same year, the Iberian colonies seceded, cutting off Carthage from a major source of silver and copper. The loss of such strategically important mineral wealth, combined with the desire to exercise firmer control over shipping routes, led Hannibal Mago, grandson of Hamilcar, to make preparations to reclaim Sicily. In 409 BC, Hannibal Mago set out for Sicily with his force. He captured the smaller cities of Selinus (modern Selinunte) and Himera‚Äîwhere the Carthaginians had been dealt a humiliating defeat seventy year prior‚Äîbefore returning triumphantly to Carthage with the spoils of war. But the primary enemy, Syracuse, remained untouched and in 405 BC, Hannibal Mago led a second Carthaginian expedition to claim the rest of the island. This time, however, he met with fiercer resistance as well as misfortune. During the siege of Agrigentum, Carthaginian forces were ravaged by plague, which claimed Hannibal Mago himself. His successor, Himilco, managed to extend the campaign, capturing the city of Gela and repeatedly defeating the army of Dionysius of Syracuse. But he, too, was struck with plague and forced to sue for peace before returning to Carthage. By 398 BC, Dionysius had regained his strength and broke the peace treaty, striking at the Carthaginian stronghold of Motya in western Sicily. Himilco responded decisively, leading an expedition that not only reclaimed Motya, but also captured Messene (present-day Messina). Within a year, the Carthaginians were besieging Syracuse itself, and came close to victory until the plague once again ravaged and reduced their forces. The fighting in Sicily swung in favor of Carthage less than a decade later in 387 BC. After winning a naval battle off the coast of Catania, Himilco laid siege to Syracuse with 50,000 Carthaginians, but yet another epidemic struck down thousands of them. With the enemy assault stalled and weakened, Dionysius then launched a surprise counterattack by land and sea, destroying all the Carthaginian ships while its crews were ashore. At the same time, his ground forces stormed the besiegers' lines and routed them. Himilco and his chief officers abandoned their army and fled Sicily. Once again, the Carthaginians were forced to press for peace. Returning to Carthage in disgrace, Himilco was met with contempt and committed suicide by starving himself. Notwithstanding consistently poor luck and costly reversals, Sicily remained an obsession for Carthage. Over the next fifty years, an uneasy peace reigned, as Carthaginian and Greek forces engaged in constant skirmishes. By 340 BC, Carthage had been pushed entirely into the southwest corner of the island.Eurasia and Africa (c. 323 BC). Third Sicilian War In 315 BC, Carthage found itself on the defensive in Sicily, as Agathocles of Syracuse broke the terms of the peace treaty and sought to dominate the entire island. Within four years, he seized Messene, laid siege to Akragas, and invaded the last Carthaginian holdings on the island. Hamilcar, grandson of Hanno the Great, led the Carthaginian response with great success. Within a year of their arrival, the Carthaginians controlled almost all of Sicily and were besieging Syracuse. In desperation, Agathocles secretly led an expedition of 14,000 men to attack Carthage, forcing Hamilcar and most of his army to return home. Although Agathocles' forces were eventually defeated in 307 BC, he managed to escape back to Sicily and negotiate peace, thus maintaining the status quo and Syracuse as a stronghold of Greek power in Sicily. = Pyrrhic War (280‚Äì275 BC) = Routes taken against Rome and Carthage in the Pyrrhic War (280‚Äì275 BC). Carthage was once again drawn into a war in Sicily, this time by Pyrrhus of Epirus, who challenged both Roman and Carthaginian supremacy over the Mediterranean. The Greek city of Tarentum, in southern Italy, had come into conflict with an expansionist Rome, and sought the aid of Pyrrhus.. Seeing an opportunity to forge a new empire, Pyrrhus sent an advance guard of 3,000 infantry to Tarentum, under the command of his adviser Cineaus. Meanwhile, he marched the main army across the Greek peninsula and won several victories over the Thessalians and Athenians. After securing the Greek mainland, Pyrrhus rejoined his advance guard in Tarentum to conquer southern Italy, winning a decisive but costly victory at Asculum. According to Justin, the Carthaginians worried that Pyrrhus might get involved in Sicily; Polybius confirms that existence of a mutual defense pact between Carthage and Rome, ratified shortly after the battle of Asculum.Polybius, The Histories, 3.25 These concerns proved prescient: during the Italian campaign, Pyrrhus received envoys from the Sicilian Greek cities of Agrigentum, Leontini, and Syracuse, which offered to submit to his rule if he aided their efforts to eject the Carthaginians from Sicily.Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus, 22:1‚Äì22:3 Having lost too many men in his conquest of Asculum, Pyrrhus determined that a war with Rome could not be sustained, making Sicily a more enticing prospect.Plutarch Parallel Lives, the Life of Pyrrhus, 21.8-10 He thus responded to the plea with reinforcements consisting of 20,000-30,000 infantry, 1,500-3,000 cavalry, and 20 war elephants supported by some 200 ships. The ensuing Sicilian campaign lasted three years, during which the Carthaginians suffered several losses and reversals. Pyrrhus overcame the Carthaginian garrison at Heraclea Minoa and seized Azones, which prompted cities nominally allied to Carthage, such as Selinus, Halicyae, and Segesta, to join his side. The Carthaginian stronghold of Eryx, which had strong natural defenses and a large garrison, held out for a long period of time, but was eventually taken. Iaetia surrendered without a fight, while Panormus, which had the best harbour in Sicily, succumbed to a siege. The Carthaginians were pushed back to the westernmost portion of the island, holding only Lilybaeum, which was put under siege.Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus, 22:4‚Äì22:6 Following these losses, Carthage sued for peace, offering large sums of money and even ships, but Pyrrhus refused unless Carthage renounced its claims to Sicily entirely.Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 22.10 The siege of Lilybaeum continued, with the Carthaginians successfully holding out due to the size of their forces, their large quantities of siege weapons, and the rocky terrain. As Pyrrhus' losses were mounting, he set out to build more powerful war engines; however, after two more months of dogged resistance, he abandoned the siege. Plutarch claimed that the ambitious king of Epirus now had his sights on Carthage itself, and began outfitting an expedition.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Pyrrhus, 23.2-3 In preparation for his invasion, he treated the Sicilian Greeks more ruthlessly, even executing two of their rulers on false charges of treason. The subsequent animosity among the Greeks of Sicily drove some to join forces with the Carthaginians, who \\"took up the war vigorously\\" upon noticing Pyrrhus' dwindling support. Cassius Dio claimed that Carthage had harboured the exiled Syracusans, and \\"harassed [Pyrrhus] so severely that he abandoned not only Syracuse but Sicily as well\\". A renewed Roman offensive also forced him to focus his attention on southern Italy.Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus, Chapter 23 According to both Plutarch and Appian, while Pyrrhus' army was being transported by ship to mainland Italy, the Carthaginian navy inflicted a devastating blow in the Battle of the Strait of Messina, sinking or disabling 98 out of 110 ships. Carthage sent additional forces to Sicily, and following Pyrrhus' departure, managed to regain control of their domains on the island. Pyrrhus' campaigns in Italy ultimately proved inconclusive, and he eventually withdrew to Epirus. For the Carthaginians, the war meant a return to the status quo, as they once again held the western and central regions of Sicily. For the Romans, however, much of Magna Graecia gradually fell under their sphere of influence, bringing them closer to complete domination of the Italian peninsula. Rome's success against Pyrrhus solidified its status as a rising power, which paved the way for conflict with Carthage. In what is likely an apocryphal account, Pyrrhus, upon departing from Sicily, told his companions, \\"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans\\"..Plutarch. Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus, 23.6. = Punic Wars (264‚Äì146 BC) = Carthage 192x192px 246x246px When Agathocles of Syracuse died in 288 BC, a large company of Italian mercenaries previously in his service found themselves suddenly unemployed. Naming themselves Mamertines (\\"Sons of Mars\\"), they seized the city of Messana and became a law unto themselves, terrorizing the surrounding countryside. The Mamertines became a growing threat to Carthage and Syracuse alike. In 265 BC, Hiero II of Syracuse, former general of Pyrrhus, took action against them. Faced with a vastly superior force, the Mamertines divided into two factions, one advocating surrender to Carthage, the other preferring to seek aid from Rome. While the Roman Senate debated the best course of action, the Carthaginians eagerly agreed to send a garrison to Messana. Carthaginian forces were admitted to the city, and a Carthaginian fleet sailed into the Messanan harbor. However, soon afterwards they began negotiating with Hiero. Alarmed, the Mamertines sent another embassy to Rome asking them to expel the Carthaginians. Hiero's intervention placed Carthage's military forces directly across the Strait of Messina, the narrow channel of water that separated Sicily from Italy. Moreover, the presence of the Carthaginian fleet gave them effective control over this strategically important bottleneck and demonstrated a clear and present danger to nearby Rome and her interests. As a result, the Roman Assembly, although reluctant to ally with a band of mercenaries, sent an expeditionary force to return control of Messana to the Mamertines. The subsequent Roman attack on Carthaginian forces at Messana triggered the first of the Punic Wars. Over the course of the next century, these three major conflicts between Rome and Carthage would determine the course of Western civilization. The wars included a dramatic Carthaginian invasion led by Hannibal, which nearly brought an end to Rome. During the First Punic Wars, the Romans under the command of Marcus Atilius Regulus managed to land in Africa, though were ultimately repelled by the Carthaginians. Notwithstanding the decisive defense of its homeland, as well as some initial naval victories, Carthage suffered a succession of losses that forced it to sue for peace. Shortly thereafter, Carthage also faced a major mercenary revolt that dramatically changed its internal political landscape, bringing the influential Barcid family to prominence. The war also impacted Carthage's international standing, as Rome used the events of the war to back its claim over Sardinia and Corsica, which it promptly seized.  Second Punic War (218‚Äì202 BC)  Adorned Statue of the Punic Goddess Tanit, from the necropolis of Puig des Molins, Ibiza, Spain (fifth-third centuries BC). Archaeology Museum of Catalonia (Barcelona, Spain).Lingering mutual animosity and renewed tensions along their borderlands led to the Second Punic War (218 to 202 BC), which involved factions from across the western and eastern Mediterranean. The war is marked by Hannibal's surprising overland journey to Rome, particularly his costly and strategically bold crossing of the Alps. His entrance into northern Italy was followed by his reinforcement by Gaulish allies and crushing victories over Roman armies in the Battle of the Trebia and the giant ambush at Trasimene. Against his skill on the battlefield the Romans employed the Fabian strategy, which resorted to skirmishes in lieu of direct engagement, with the aim delaying and gradually weakening his forces. While effective, this approach was politically unpopular, as it ran contrary to traditional military strategy. The Romans thus resorted to another major field battle at Cannae, but despite their superior numbers, suffered a crushing defeat. Consequently, many Roman allies went over to Carthage, prolonging the war in Italy for over a decade, during which more Roman armies were nearly consistently destroyed on the battlefield. Despite these setbacks, the Romans had the manpower to absorb such losses and replenish their ranks. Along with their superior capability in siegecraft, they were able to recapture all the major cities that had joined the enemy, as well as defeat a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at the Battle of the Metaurus. Meanwhile, in Iberia, which served as the main source of manpower for the Carthaginian army, a second Roman expedition under Scipio Africanus took New Carthage and ended Carthaginian rule over the peninsula in the Battle of Ilipa.Kern 1999, p. 269-270 The final showdown was the Battle of Zama, which took place in the Carthaginian heartland of Tunisia. After trouncing Carthaginian forces at the battles of Utica and the Great Plains, Scipio Africanus forced Hannibal to abandon his increasingly stalled campaign in Italy. Despite the latter's superior numbers and innovative tactics, the Carthaginians suffered a crushing and decisive defeat. After years of costly fighting that brought them to the verge of destruction, the Romans imposed harsh and retributive peace conditions on Carthage. In addition to a large financial indemnity, the Carthaginians were stripped of their once-proud navy and reduced only to their North African territory. In effect, Carthage became a Roman client state. The third and final Punic War began in 149 BC, largely due to the efforts of hawkish Roman senators, led by Cato the Elder, to finish Carthage off once and for all. Cato was known for finishing nearly every speech in the Senate, regardless of the subject, with the phrase ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam‚Äî\\"Moreover, I am of the opinion that Carthage ought to be destroyed\\". In particular, the growing Roman Republic sought the famously rich agricultural lands of Carthage and its African territories, which had been known to the Romans following their invasion in the previous Punic War. Carthage's border war with Rome's ally Numidia, though initiated by the latter, nonetheless provided the pretext for Rome to declare war. The Third Punic War was a much smaller and shorter engagement than its predecessors, primarily consisting of a single main action, the Battle of Carthage. However, given their significantly reduced size, military, and wealth, the Carthaginians managed to mount a surprisingly strong initial defense. The Roman invasion was soon stalled by defeats at Lake Tunis, Nepheris, and Hippagreta; even the truncated Carthaginian navy managed to inflict severe losses on a Roman fleet through the use of fire ships.Appian, Punica 97‚Äì99 Carthage itself managed to resist the Roman siege for three years, until Scipio Aemilianus‚Äîthe adopted grandson of Scipio Africanus‚Äîwas appointed consul and took command of the assault. Notwithstanding its impressive resistance, Carthage's defeat was ultimately a foregone conclusion, given the far larger size and strength of the Roman Republic. Though it was the smallest of the Punic Wars, the third war was to be the most decisive: The complete destruction of the city of Carthage, the annexation of all remaining Carthaginian territory by Rome, and the death or enslavement of tens of thousands of Carthaginians.Dillon Garland 2005, p. 228 The war ended Carthage's independent existence, and consequently eliminated the last Phoenician political power. = Aftermath = Following Carthage's destruction, Rome established Africa Proconsularis, its first province in Africa, which roughly corresponded to Carthage's northwest African territory. Utica, which had allied itself with Rome during the final war, was granted tax privileges and made the regional capital, subsequently becoming the leading center of Punic trade and culture. In 122 BC, Gaius Gracchus, a populist Roman senator, founded the short-lived colony of Colonia Iunonia, after the Latin name for the Punic goddess Tanit, Iuno Caelestis. Located near the site of Carthage, its purpose was to provide arable lands for impoverished farmers, but it was soon abolished by the Roman Senate to undermine Gracchus' power. Nearly a century after the fall of Carthage, a new \\"Roman Carthage\\" was built on the same site by Julius Caesar between 49 and 44 BC. It soon became the center of the province of Africa, which was a major breadbasket of the Roman Empire and one of its wealthiest provinces. By the first century, Carthago had grown to be the second-largest city in the western Roman Empire, with a peak population of 500,000. Punic language, identity, and culture persisted several centuries into Roman rule. Two third-century Roman emperors‚ÄîSeptimius Severus and his son and successor Caracalla‚Äîwere of Punic descent. In the fourth century, Augustine of Hippo, himself of Berber heritage, noted that Punic was still spoken in the region by people who identified as Kn'nm, or \\"Chanani\\", as the Carthaginians had called themselves. Settlements across North Africa, Sardinia, and Sicily continued to speak and write Punic, as evidenced by inscriptions on temples, tombs, public monuments, and artwork dating well after the Roman conquest. Punic names were still used until at least the fourth century, even by prominent denizens of Roman Africa, and some local officials in formerly Punic territories used the title Some Punic ideas and innovations survived Roman conquest and even became mainstream in Roman culture. Mago's manual on farming and estate management was among the few Carthaginian texts to be spared from destruction, and was even translated into Greek and Latin by order of the Senate.Miles, Richard (2010). Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization. United States: Penguin Books. p. 13. . Latin vernacular had several reference to Punic culture, including mala Punica (\\"Punic Apples\\") for pomegranates; pavimentum Punicum to describe the use of patterned terracotta pieces in mosaics; and plostellum Punicum for the threshing board, which had been introduced to the Romans by Carthage. (p√°gina 421) Reflecting the enduring hostility towards Carthage, the phrase P≈´nica fidƒìs, or \\"Punic faith\\", was commonly used to describe acts of dishonesty, perfidy, and treachery.J. A. S. Evans, THE LAND OF THE CARTHAGINIANS, Vergilius (1959-), No. 6 (Fall, 1960), p. 14, www.jstor.org/stable/41591541 Government and politics Punic district of Carthage Like most ancient societies, including the Phoenician city-states, Carthage was initially ruled as a monarchy, although modern scholars debate whether this stemmed from a misunderstanding by Greek writers.Richard Miles, Carthage Must be Destroyed, Penguin, p. 67. Traditionally, most Phoenician kings did not exercise absolute power, but consulted with a body of advisors called the Adirim (\\"mighty ones\\"), which was likely comprised of the wealthiest members of society, namely merchants.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 20-22. Carthage seems to have been ruled by a similar body known as the Blm, made up of nobles responsible for all important matters of state, including religion, administration, and the military. Within this cabal was a hierarchy topped by the dominant family, usually the wealthiest members of the merchant class, which had some sort of executive power. Records indicate that different families held power at different times, suggesting a nonhereditary system of government dependent on the support or approval of the consultative body. Carthage's political system changed dramatically after 483 BC, following the total rout of its forces at the battle of Himera during the First Sicilian War. The ruling Magonid clan‚Äîof which the defeated King Hamilcar was a member‚Äîwas compelled to allow representative institutions that would prevent one or a handful of individuals from exercising too much power. Carthage became an oligarchic republic characterized by a complex system checks and balances and a fairly high degree of public accountability and participation. The most detailed information about the Carthaginian government after this point comes from the Greek philosopher Aristotle's Politics, which was written in the fourth century BC. At the head of the Carthaginian state were two sufetes or \\"judges\\", who had judicial and executive powers.Punic: ê§î‚Äèê§êê§à, ≈°≈´fe·π≠; Phoenician: PŒò Though both Greek and Roman authors commonly referred to them as kings, by at least the late fifth century BC, the sufetes were nonhereditary offices elected annually from among the wealthiest and most influential families; it is unknown how they were elected or who was eligible to serve. Livy likens the sufetes to Roman consuls, claiming they ruled mostly through collegiality and handled certain matters of state, such as the convocation and presidency of the Adirim (supreme council), the submission of business to the popular assembly, and the adjudication of trials.Thus rendered in Latin by Livy 30.7.5, attested in Punic inscriptions as SPŒòM , meaning \\"judges\\" and obviously related to the Biblical Hebrew ruler title \\"Judge\\") Some modern historians compare the sufetes to executive presidents, in that they did not hold absolute power and exercised largely ceremonial functions. This practice may have originated from the plutocratic oligarchies that limited the sufetes' power in earlier Phoenician cities. In the sixth century BC, Tyre had adopted a similar system, characterised as a \\"republic headed by elective magistrates\\",Bondi, S.F. (2001), \\"Political and Administrative Organization,\\" in Moscati, S. (ed.), The Phoenicians. London: I.B. Tauris. with two sufetes chosen from the most powerful noble families for short terms.Stephen Stockwell, \\"Before Athens: Early Popular Government in Phoenician and Greek City States,\\" Geopolitics, History, and International Relations 2 (2010): 128. Unique among rulers in antiquity, the sufetes had no power over the military: generals (rb mhnt or rab mahanet) became a separate political office during the sixth century BC, either appointed by the administration or elected by citizens.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 33. In contrast to Rome and Greece, military and political power were separate, and it was rare for a sufete to also be a general. Generals did not serve fixed terms, and were usually selected based on the length or scale of a war. However, a family that dominated the sufetes could install relatives or allies to the generalship, as was the case with the Barcid dynasty. Most political power rested in a council of elders, variably called the supreme council or Adirim, which the Romans compared to their Senate and Aristotle likens to the Spartan Gerousia. The Adirim perhaps numbered thirty members and had a broad range of powers, such as administering the treasury and conducting foreign affairs. During the Second Punic War it reportedly exercised some military power. Its members were drawn from the wealthiest members of Carthaginian society. According to Aristotle, a special judicial tribunal known as the One Hundred and Four (ê§åê§Äê§ï or miat) served as Carthage's \\"highest constitutional authority\\".Dridi Edie, Glossary, Carthage and the Punic World = Carthage et Le Monde Punique Veche, 2008. p. 400, Although he compares it to the Spartan ephors, which held considerable political power, the tribunal's main function was overseeing the actions of generals and other officials to ensure they were serving the best interests of the republic. The One Hundred and Four had the power to impose fines and even crucifixion as punishment. It also formed panels of special commissioners, called pentarchies, to deal with various state affairs. Numerous junior officials and special commissioners were responsible for different aspects of government, such as public works, tax collection, and the administration of the state treasury.Aristotle. p. 2.11.3‚Äì70. Carthaginian silver shekel depicting a man wearing a laurel wreath on the obverse, and a man riding a war elephant on the reverse (c. 239‚Äì209 BC) Although Carthage was firmly controlled by oligarchs, its government included some democratic elements, including elected legislators, trade unions, town meetings, and a popular assembly. Aristotle claims that in the event the sufetes and the supreme council could not come to an agreement on a matter, an assembly of the people had the decisive vote, unlike in the Greek republics of Sparta and Crete. It is unclear whether this assembly was ad hoc or a formal institution, but Aristotle claims that \\"the voice of the people was predominant in the deliberations\\" and \\"the people themselves solved problems\\". Both he and Herodotus state that the Carthaginian government was more meritocratic than even some Hellenistic counterparts, with \\"great men\\" like Hamilcar being elected to \\"royal office\\" based on \\"outstanding achievements\\" and \\"special merit\\".Pedro Barcel√≥, THE PERCEPTION OF CARTHAGE IN CLASSICAL GREEK HISTORIOGRAPHY, Acta Classica, Vol. 37 (1994), pp. 1-14, Classical Association of South Africa, http://www.jstor.org/stable/24594338, p. 8. Aristotle also praises Carthage's political system for its \\"balanced\\" elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, believing that each element was kept in check by the other two. Aristotle's Athenian contemporary, Isocrates, elevates Carthage's political system as the best in antiquity, equaled only by Sparta's.Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, pp. 32-41. > It is noteworthy that Aristotle ascribes to Carthage a position among the > Greek states, because the Greeks firmly believed that they alone had the > ability to found 'poleis', whereas the barbarians used to live in tribal > societies ('ethne').

Confirming Aristotle's claims, Polybius states that during the Punic Wars, the Carthaginian public held more sway over the government than the Romans did over theirs.Histories, book 6. However, he regards this development as a fatal flaw, since it led the Carthaginians to bicker and debate while the Romans, through the more oligarchic Senate, acted more quickly and decisively. This may have been due to the influence and populism of the Barcid faction, which between the end of the First Punic War and the end of the Second Punic War dominated Carthage's government, military, and overseas territories. Carthage reportedly had a constitution of some form. Aristotle devotes a section in his Politics to analyzing the Carthaginian constitution, which is the only non- Greek example to be discussed. He compares Carthage's constitution favorably to its well regarded Spartan counterpart, describing it as sophisticated, functional, and fulfilling \\"all needs of moderation and justice\\".Benjamin Jowett. The Politics of Aristotle. Colonial Press (1900), pp. 49-51. http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/aristotle-carthage.html Eratosthenes, a Greek polymath and head of the Library of Alexandria, praises the Carthaginians as among the few barbarians to be refined and \\"admirably\\" governed. Some scholars suggest the Greeks generally held Carthage's institutions in high regard, regarding the Carthaginians as close to equal. Carthage's republican system appears to have extended to the rest of its empire, though to what extent and in what form is unknown. The term sufet was used for officials throughout its colonies and territories; inscriptions from Punic-era Sardinia are dated with four names: the sufetes of the island as well as of Carthage. This suggests some degree of political coordination between local and colonial Carthaginians, perhaps through a regional hierarchy of sufetes. = Citizenship = Like the republics of the Latin and Hellenistic worlds, Carthage had a notion of citizenship, distinguishing those in society who could participate in the political process and who had certain rights, privileges, and duties. However, it is uncertain whether such a distinction existed, much less the specific criteria. For example, while the Popular Assembly is described as giving a political voice to the common people, there is no mention of any restrictions based on citizenship. Carthaginian society was complex and divided into many different classes, including slaves, peasants, aristocrats, merchants, and various professionals. Moreover, Carthage's empire consisted of an often nebulous network of Punic colonies, subject peoples, client states, and allied tribes and kingdoms; it is unknown whether individuals from these different realms and nationalities formed any particular social or political class in relation to the Carthaginian government. Roman accounts suggest that Carthaginian citizens, especially those allowed to run for high office, had to prove their descent from the city's founders. This would indicate that Phoenicians were privileged over other ethnic groups, while those whose lineage traced back to the city's founding were privileged over fellow Phoenicians descended from later waves of settlers. However, it would also mean that someone of partial \\"foreign\\" ancestry could still be a citizen; indeed, Hamilcar, who served as a sufete in 480 BC, was half Greek. Greek writers claimed that ancestry, as well as wealth and merit, were avenues to citizenship and political power. As Carthage was a mercantile society, this would imply that both citizenship and membership in the aristocracy were relatively accessible by ancient standards. Aristotle mentions Carthaginian \\"associations\\" similar to the Hellenistic hetairiai, organizations roughly analogous to political parties or interest groups. These were most likely the mizrehim referenced in Carthaginian inscriptions, of which little is known or attested, but which appeared to have been numerous in number and subject, from devotional cults to professional guilds. It is unknown whether such an association was required of citizens, as in some Greek republics like Sparta. Aristotle also describes a Carthaginian equivalent to the syssitia, communal meals that were the mark of citizenship and social class in Greek societies.Politics VII. 9 Once again, however, it is unclear whether Carthaginians attributed any political significance to their equivalent practice. Carthage's military provides a possible glimpse into the criteria of citizenship. Greek accounts describe a \\"Sacred Band of Carthage\\" that fought in Sicily in the mid fourth century BC, using the Hellenistic term for professional citizen soldiers selected on the basis of merit and ability. Roman writings about the Punic Wars describe the core of the military, including its commanders and officers, as being made up of \\"Liby-Phoenicians\\", a broad label that included ethnic Phoenicians, those of mixed Punic-North African descent, and Libyans who had integrated into Phoenician culture. During the Second Punic War, Hannibal promised his foreign troops Carthaginian citizenship, as well as wealth and land, if they proved victorious over the Romans.Richard Miles, Carthage Must be Destroyed, p. 268. = Survival under Roman rule = Aspects of Carthage's political system persisted well into the Roman period, albeit to varying degrees and often in Romanized form. Sufetes are mentioned in inscriptions throughout the major settlements of Roman Sardinia, indicating the office was perhaps used by Punic descendants to resist both cultural and political assimilation with their Latin conquerors. As late as the mid second century AD, two sufetes wielded power in Bithia, a city in the Roman province of Sardinia and Corsica. The Romans seemed to have actively tolerated, if not adopted, Carthaginian offices and institutions. Official state terminology of the late Roman Republic and subsequent Empire repurposed the word sufet to refer to Roman-style local magistrates serving in Africa Proconsularis, which included Carthage and its core territories. Sufetes are attested to have governed over forty post-Carthaginian towns and cities, including Althiburos, Calama, Capsa, Cirta, Gadiaufala, Gales, Limisa, Mactar, and Thugga. Though many were former Carthaginian settlements, some had little to no Carthaginian influence; Volubilis, in modern-day Morocco, had been part of the Kingdom of Mauretania, which became a Roman client state after the fall of Carthage.Rogerson, Barnaby (2010). Marrakesh, Fez and Rabat. London: Cadogan Guides. , p. 236. The use of sufetes persisted well into the late second century AD. Sufetes were prevalent even in interior regions of Roman Africa that had never been settled by Carthage. This suggests that, unlike the Punic community of Roman Sardinia, Punic settlers and refugees endeared themselves to Roman authorities by adopting a readily intelligible government. Three sufetes serving simultaneously appear in first century AD records at Althiburos, Mactar, and Thugga, reflecting a choice to adopt Punic nomenclature for Romanized institutions without the actual, traditionally balanced magistracy. In those cases, a third, non-annual position of tribal or communal chieftain marked an inflection point in the assimilation of external African groups into the Roman political fold. Sufes, the Roman approximation of the term sufet, appears in at least six works of Latin literature. Erroneous references to Carthaginian \\"kings\\" with the Latin term rex betray the translations of Roman authors from Greek sources, who equated the sufet with the more monarchical basileus (). Military The military of Carthage was one of the largest in the ancient world. Although Carthage's navy was always its main military force, the army acquired a key role in the spread of Carthaginian power over the native peoples of northern Africa and southern Iberian Peninsula from the sixth to third centuries BC. = Army = Hannibal Barca counting the rings of the Roman knights killed at the Battle of Cannae (216 BC), by S√©bastien Slodtz (1704). Gardens of the Tuileries, Louvre Museum. Hannibal is regarded as one of the most brilliant military strategists in history. As a mainly commercial empire with a relatively small native population, Carthage generally did not maintain a large, permanent, standing army. However, since at least the reign of Mago in the early sixth century BC, Carthage regularly utilized its military to advance its commercial and strategic interests.Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, p. 153. According to Polybius, Carthage relied heavily, though not exclusively, on foreign mercenaries, especially in overseas warfare.Polybius, Book 6, 52. On the Perseus project Modern historians regard this as an oversimplification, as many foreign troops were actually auxiliaries from allied or client states, provided through formal agreements, tributary obligations, or military pacts. The Carthaginians maintained close relations, sometimes through political marriages, with the rulers of various tribes and kingdoms, most notably the Numidians (based in modern northern Algeria). These leaders would in turn provide their respective contingent of forces, sometimes even leading them in Carthaginian campaigns. In any event, Carthage leveraged its vast wealth and hegemony to help fill the ranks of its military. Contrary to popular belief, especially among the more martial Greeks and Romans, Carthage did utilize citizen soldiers‚Äîi.e., ethnic Punics/Phoenicians‚Äîparticularly during the Sicilian Wars. Moreover, like their Greco-Roman contemporaries, the Carthaginians respected \\"military valour\\", with Aristotle reporting the practice of citizens wearing armbands to signify their combat experience. Greek observers also described the \\"Sacred Band of Carthage\\", a Hellenistic term for professional citizen soldiers who fought in Sicily in the mid fourth century BC.Head, Duncan \\"Armies of the Macedonian and Punic Wars 359 BC to 146 BC\\" (1982), p140. However, after this force was destroyed by Agathocles in 310 BC, foreign mercenaries and auxiliaries formed a more significant part of the army. This indicates that the Carthaginians had a capacity to adapt their military as circumstances required; when larger or more specialized forces were needed, such as during the Punic Wars, they would employ mercenaries or auxiliaries accordingly. Carthaginian citizens would be enlisted in large numbers only by necessity, such as for the pivotal Battle of Zama in the Second Punic War, or in the final siege of the city in the Third Punic War. The core of the Carthaginian army was always from its own territory in Northwest Africa, namely ethnic Libyans, Numidians, and \\"Liby-Phoenicians\\", a broad label that included ethnic Phoenicians, those of mixed Punic-North African descent, and Libyans who had integrated into Phoenician culture.Gregory Daly, Cannae: The Experience of Battle in the Second Punic War, p. 90. These troops were supported by mercenaries from different ethnic groups and geographic locations across the Mediterranean, who fought in their own national units. For instance, Celts, Balearics, and Iberians were recruited in significant numbers to fight in Sicily. Greek mercenaries, who were highly valued for their skill, were hired for the Sicilian campaigns. Carthage employed Iberian troops long before the Punic Wars; Herodotus and Alcibiades both describe the fighting capabilities of the Iberians among the western Mediterranean mercenaries. Later, after the Barcids conquered large portions of Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal), Iberians came to form an even greater part of the Carthaginian forces, albeit based more on their loyalty to the Barcid faction than to Carthage itself. The Carthaginians also fielded slingers, soldiers armed with straps of cloth used to toss small stones at high speeds; for this they often recruited Balearic Islanders, who were reputed for their accuracy. The uniquely diverse makeup of Carthage's army, particularly during the Second Punic War, was noteworthy to the Romans; Livy characterized Hannibal's army as a \\"hotch-potch of the riff-raff of all nationalities.\\" He also observed that the Carthaginians, at least under Hannibal, never forced any uniformity upon their disparate forces, which nonetheless had such a high degree of unity that they \\"never quarreled amongst themselves nor mutinied\\", even during difficult circumstances.Livy, The War with Hannibal: The History of Rome from its Foundation, Books 21-30. Punic officers at all levels maintained some degree of unity and coordination among these otherwise disparate forces. They also dealt with the challenge of ensuring military commands were properly communicated and translated to their respective foreign troops. Carthage used the diversity of its forces to its own advantage, capitalizing on the particular strengths or capabilities of each nationality. Celts and Iberians were often utilized as shock troops, North Africans as cavalry, and Campanians from southern Italy as heavy infantry. Moreover, these units would typically be deployed to nonnative lands, which ensured they had no affinity for their opponents and could surprise them with unfamiliar tactics. For example, Hannibal used Iberians and Gauls (from what is today France) for campaigns in Italy and Africa. Carthage seems to have fielded a formidable cavalry force, especially in its Northwest African homeland; a significant part of it was composed of light Numidian cavalry, who were considered \\"by far the best horsemen in Africa.\\"Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 29.35.8. Their speed and agility proved pivotal to several Carthaginian victories, most notably the Battle of Trebia, the first major action in the Second Punic War.\\"Second Punic War  UNRV.com Roman History\\". http://www.unrv.com. Retrieved 2020-05-26. The reputation and effectiveness of Numidian cavalry was such that the Romans utilized a contingent of their own in the decisive Battle of Zama, where they reportedly \\"turned the scales\\" in Rome's favor.Fuller, J.F.C., Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, and Tyrant. p. 28 Sidnell, Philip. Warhorse: Cavalry in the Ancient World, p.194. Polybius suggests that cavalry remained the force in which Carthaginian citizens were most represented following the shift to mostly foreign troops after the third century BC. Owing to Hannibal's campaigns in the Second Punic War, Carthage is perhaps best remembered for its use of the now-extinct North African elephant, which was specially trained for warfare and, among other uses, was commonly utilized for frontal assaults or as anticavalry protection. An army could field up to several hundred of these animals, but on most reported occasions fewer than a hundred were deployed. The riders of these elephants were armed with a spike and hammer to kill the elephants, in case they charged toward their own army. During the sixth century BC, Carthaginian generals became a distinct political office known in Punic as rb mhnt, or rab mahanet. Unlike in other ancient societies. Carthage maintained a separation of military and political power, with generals either appointed by the administration or elected by citizens. Generals did not serve fixed terms but were usually selected based on the length or scale of a war.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 34 Initially, the generalship was apparently occupied by two separate but equal offices, such as an army commander and an admiral; by the mid third century, military campaigns were usually carried out by a supreme commander and a deputy. During the Second Punic War, Hannibal appears to have exercised total control over all military affairs, and had up to seven subordinate generals divided along different theaters of war. = Navy = Carthage's navy usually operated in support of its land campaigns, which remained key to its expansion and defense. The Carthaginians maintained the ancient Phoenicians'reputation as skilled mariners, navigators, and shipbuilders. Polybius wrote that the Carthaginians were \\"more exercised in maritime affairs than any other people.\\"Polybius, History Book 6 Its navy was one of the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean, using serial production to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. During the Second Punic War, at which point Carthage had lost most of its Mediterranean islands, it still managed to field some 300 to 350 warships. The sailors and marines of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the Punic citizenry, unlike the multiethnic allied and mercenary troops of the Carthaginian army. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors, which helped contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt- ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot.Adrian Goldsworthy ‚Äì The Fall of Carthage The reputation of Carthaginian sailors implies that the training of oarsmen and coxswains occurred in peacetime, giving the navy a cutting edge. In addition to its military functions, the Carthaginian navy was key to the empire's commercial dominance, helping secure trade routes, protect harbors, and even enforce trade monopolies against competitors. Carthaginian fleets also served an exploratory function, most likely for the purpose of finding new trade routes or markets. Evidence exists of at least one expedition, that of Hanno the Navigator, possibly sailing along the West African coast to regions south of the Tropic of Cancer. In addition to the use of serial production, Carthage developed complex infrastructure to support and maintain its sizable fleet. Cicero described the city as \\"surrounded by harbours\\", while accounts from Appian and Strabo describe a large and sophisticated harbor known as the Cothon (Greek: Œ∫œéŒ∏œâŒΩ, lit. \\"drinking vessel\\").Tracy, Theodore James, \\"Carthage: Her Civilization and Culture\\" (1942). Master's Theses. 404 (Loyola University) https://ecommons.luc.edu/luc_theses/404, pp. 63-67.De lege agraria II, 32, 87. Based on similar structures used for centuries across the Phoenician world, the Cothon was a key factor in Carthaginian naval supremacy; its prevalence throughout the empire is unknown, but both Utica and Motya had comparable harbors.Cecil Torr, The Harbours of Carthage, The Classical Review, Vol. 5, No. 6 (Jun., 1891), 280-284 Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association, www.jstor.org/stable/693421. According to both ancient descriptions and modern archaeological findings, the Cothon was divided into a rectangular merchant harbor followed by an inner protected harbor reserved for military vessels. The inner harbor was circular and surrounded by an outer ring of structures partitioned into docking bays, along with an island structure at its centre that also housed naval ships. Each individual docking bay featured a raised slipway, allowing ships to be dry-docked for maintenance and repair. Above the raised docking bays was a second level consisting of warehouses where oars and rigging were kept along with supplies such as wood and canvas. The island structure had a raised \\"cabin\\" where the admiral in command could observe the whole harbor along with the surrounding sea. Altogether the inner docking complex could house up to 220 ships. The entire harbor was protected by an outer wall, while the main entrance could be closed off with iron chains. The Romans, who had little experience in naval warfare prior to the First Punic War, managed to defeat Carthage in part by reverse engineering captured Carthaginian ships, aided by the recruitment of experienced Greek sailors from conquered cities, the unorthodox corvus device, and their superior numbers in marines and rowers. Polybius describes a tactical innovation of the Carthaginians during the Third Punic War, consisting of augmenting their few triremes with small vessels that carried hooks (to attack the oars) and fire (to attack the hulls). With this new combination, they were able to stand their ground against the numerically superior Romans for a whole day. The Romans also utilized the Cothon in their rebuilding of the city, which helped support the region's commercial and strategic development.Henry Hurst (2019) Understanding Carthage as a Roman Port, https://bollettinodiarcheologiaonline.beniculturali.it/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/6_Hurst_paper.pdf = The One Hundred and Four = Carthage was unique in antiquity for separating political and military offices, and for having the former exercise control over the latter.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 35-36. In addition to being appointed or elected by the state, generals were subject to reviews of their performance. The government was infamous for its severe attitude towards defeated commanders; in some instances, the penalty for failure was execution, usually by crucifixion. Before the fourth or fifth century BC, generals were probably judged by the supreme council and/or sufetes, until a special tribunal was created specifically this function: what Aristotle calls the One Hundred and Four. Described by Justin as being established during the republican reforms led by the Magonids, this body was responsible for scrutinizing and punishing generals following every military campaign. Its harshness was such that some modern scholars describe it as the \\"nemesis of generals\\". Although the One Hundred and Four was intended to ensure that military leaders better served the interests of Carthage, its draconian approach may also have led to generals to be overly cautious for fear of reprisal. However, despite its notorious reputation, punishments are rarely recorded; although an admiral named Hanno was crucified for his disastrous defeat in the First Punic War, other commanders, including Hannibal, escaped such a fate. This has led some historians to speculate that the tribunal's decisions may have been influenced by familial or factional politics, given that many high-ranking military officers or their relatives and allies held political office. Language Carthaginians spoke a variety of Phoenician called Punic, a Semitic language originating in their ancestral homeland of Phoenicia (present-day Lebanon). Like its parent language, Punic was written from right to left, consisted of 22 consonants without vowels, and is known mostly through inscriptions. During classical antiquity, Punic was spoken throughout Carthage's territories and spheres of influence in the western Mediterranean, namely northwest Africa and several Mediterranean islands. Although the Carthaginians maintained ties and cultural affinity with their Phoenician homeland, their Punic dialect gradually became influenced by various Berber languages spoken in and around Carthage by the ancient Libyans. Following the fall of Carthage, a \\"Neo-Punic\\" dialect emerged that diverged from Punic in terms of spelling conventions and the use of non-Semitic names, mostly of Libyco-Berber origin. Notwithstanding the destruction of Carthage and assimilation of its people into the Roman Republic, Punic appeared to have persisted for centuries in the former Carthaginian homeland. This is best attested by Augustine of Hippo, himself of Berber descent, who spoke and understood Punic and served as the \\"primary source on the survival of [late] Punic\\". He claims the language was still spoken in his region of North Africa in the fifth century, and that there were still people who self identified as chanani (Canaanite: Carthaginian). Contemporaneous funerary texts found in Christian catacombs in Sirte, Libya bear inscriptions in Ancient Greek, Latin, and Punic, suggesting a fusion of the cultures under Roman rule. There is evidence that Punic was still spoken and written by commoners in Sardinia at least 400 years after the Roman conquest. In addition to Augustine of Hippo, Punic was known by some literate North Africans until the second or third centuries (albeit written in Roman and Greek script) and remained spoken among peasants at least until the end of the fourth century. Economy 271x271px Carthage's commerce extended by sea throughout the Mediterranean and perhaps as far as the Canary Islands, and by land across the Sahara desert. According to Aristotle, the Carthaginians had commercial treaties with various trading partners to regulate their exports and imports. Aristotle, Politics Book 3,IXProfessor Iain Stewart, BBC series \\"How the Earth Made Us\\", episode 1: Deep Earth (2010) Their merchant ships, which surpassed in number even those of the original Phoenician city-states, visited every major port of the Mediterranean, as well as Britain and the Atlantic coast of Africa.Fage 1975, p. 296 These ships were able to carry over 100 tons of goods. Archaeological discoveries show evidence of all kinds of exchanges, from the vast quantities of tin needed for bronze-based civilizations, to all manner of textiles, ceramics, and fine metalwork. Even between the punishing Punic wars, Carthaginian merchants remained at every port in the Mediterranean, trading in harbours with warehouses or from ships beached on the coast. The empire of Carthage depended heavily on its trade with Tartessos and other cities of the Iberian peninsula,Markoe 2000, p.103 from which it obtained vast quantities of silver, lead, copper and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì tin ore, which was essential to manufacture the bronze objects that were highly prized in antiquity. Carthaginian trade relations with the Iberians, and the naval might that enforced Carthage's monopoly on this trade and the Atlantic tin trade, made it the sole significant broker of tin and maker of bronze in its day. Maintaining this monopoly was one of the major sources of power and prosperity for Carthage; Carthaginian merchants strove to keep the location of the tin mines secret. In addition to its exclusive role as the main distributor of tin, Carthage's central location in the Mediterranean and control of the waters between Sicily and Tunisia allowed it to control the eastern peoples' supply of tin. Carthage was also the Mediterranean's largest producer of silver, mined in Iberia and on the Northwest African coast; after the tin monopoly, this was one of its most profitable trades. One mine in Iberia provided Hannibal with 300 Roman pounds (3.75 talents) of silver a day.Pliny, Nat His 33,96 Carthage's economy began as an extension of that of its parent city, Tyre. Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the trade in the extremely valuable dye Tyrian purple. SorenKhader 1991, p. 90. No evidence of purple dye manufacture has been found at Carthage, but mounds of shells of the murex marine snails, from which it derived, have been found in excavations of the Punic town of Kerkouane, at Dar Essafi on Cap Bon. Similar mounds of murex have also been found at Djerba on the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia. Strabo mentions the purple dye-works of Djerba as well as those of the ancient city of Zouchis.Strabo, Geography XVII, 3, 18. The purple dye became one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean, being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. In Roman society, where adult males wore the toga as a national garment, the use of the toga praetexta, decorated with a stripe of Tyrian purple about two to three inches in width along its border, was reserved for magistrates and high priests. Broad purple stripes (latus clavus) were reserved for the togas of the senatorial class, while the equestrian class had the right to wear narrow stripes (angustus clavus).SebestaBonfante 1994, pp.13‚Äì15 Punic pendant in the form of a bearded head, 4th‚Äì3rd century BC.In addition to its extensive trade network, Carthage had a diversified and advanced manufacturing sector. It produced finely embroidered silks, dyed textiles of cotton, linen, and wool, artistic and functional pottery, faience, incense, and perfumes. Its artisans worked expertly with ivory,Warmington 1993, p.136 glassware, and wood, as well as with alabaster, bronze, brass, lead, gold, silver, and precious stones to create a wide array of goods, including mirrors, furniture and cabinetry, beds, bedding, and pillows, jewelry, arms, implements, and household items. It traded in salted Atlantic fish and fish sauce (garum), and brokered the manufactured, agricultural, and natural products Bogucki 2008, p.290 of almost every Mediterranean people. Bronze engraving and stone-carving are described as having reached their zenith in the fourth and third centuries.Picard, The Life and Death of Carthage (Paris 1970; New York 1968) at 162‚Äì165 (carvings described), 176‚Äì178 (quote).Carthaginian coin possibly depicting Hannibal as Hercules While primarily a maritime power, Carthage also sent caravans into the interior of Africa and Persia. It traded its manufactured and agricultural goods to the coastal and interior peoples of Africa for salt, gold, timber, ivory, ebony, apes, peacocks, skins, and hides.Bogucki 2008, p. 390 Its merchants invented the practice of sale by auction and used it to trade with the African tribes. In other ports, they tried to establish permanent warehouses or sell their goods in open-air markets. They obtained amber from Scandinavia, and from the Iberians, Gauls, and Celts received amber, tin, silver, and furs. Sardinia and Corsica produced gold and silver for Carthage, and Phoenician settlements on Malta and the Balearic Islands produced commodities that would be sent back to Carthage for large-scale distribution. The city supplied poorer civilizations with simple products such as pottery, metallic objects, and ornamentations, often displacing local manufacturing, but brought its best works to wealthier ones such as the Greeks and Etruscans. Carthage traded in almost every commodity wanted by the ancient world, including spices from Arabia, Africa and India, as well as slaves (the empire of Carthage temporarily held a portion of Europe and sent conquered barbarian warriors into North African slavery). Herodotus wrote an account around 430 BC of Carthaginian trade on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. The Punic explorer and sufete of Carthage, Hanno the Navigator, led an expedition to recolonise the Atlantic coast of Morocco that may have ventured as far down the coast of Africa as Senegal and perhaps even beyond.Lipi≈Ñski 2004, pp. 435-437 The Greek version of the Periplus of Hanno describes his voyage. Although it is not known just how far his fleet sailed on the African coastline, this short report, dating probably from the fifth or sixth century BC, identifies distinguishing geographic features such as a coastal volcano and an encounter with hairy hominids. The Etruscan language is imperfectly deciphered, but bilingual inscriptions found in archaeological excavations at the sites of Etruscan cities indicate the Phoenicians had trading relations with the Etruscans for centuries. In 1964, a shrine to Astarte, a popular Phoenician deity, was discovered in Italy containing three gold tablets with inscriptions in Etruscan and Phoenician, giving tangible proof of the Phoenician presence in the Italian peninsula at the end of the sixth century BC, long before the rise of Rome. These inscriptions imply a political and commercial alliance between Carthage and the Etruscan city state of Caere, which would corroborate Aristotle's statement that the Etruscans and Carthaginians were so close as to form almost one people.BonfanteBonfante 2002, p.68 The Etruscans were at times both commercial partners and military allies. = Agriculture = Carthage's North African hinterland was famed in antiquity for its fertile soil and ability to support abundant livestock and crops. Diodorus shares an eyewitness account from the fourth century BC describing lush gardens, verdant plantations, large and luxurious estates, and a complex network of canals and irrigation channels. Roman envoys visiting in the mid-second century BC, including Cato the Censor‚Äîknown for his fondness for agriculture as much as for his low regard of foreign cultures‚Äîdescribed the Carthaginian countryside as thriving with both human and animal life. Polybius, writing of his visit during the same period, claims that a greater number and variety of livestock were raised in Carthage than anywhere else in the known world.Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, pp. 65-67. Initially, the Carthaginians, like their Phoenician founders, did not heavily engage in agriculture. Like nearly all Phoenician cities and colonies, Carthage was primarily settled along the coast; evidence of settlement in the interior dates only to the late fourth century BC, several centuries after its founding. As they settled further inland, the Carthaginians eventually made the most of the region's rich soil, developing what may have been one of the most prosperous and diversified agricultural sectors of its time. They practised highly advanced and productive agriculture, using iron ploughs, irrigation, crop rotation, threshing machines, hand-driven rotary mills, and horse mills, the latter two being invented by the Carthaginians in the sixth and fourth centuries BC, respectively. Carthaginians were adept at refining and reinventing their agricultural techniques, even in the face of adversity. After the Second Punic War, Hannibal promoted agriculture to help restore Carthage's economy and pay the costly war indemnity to Rome (10,000 talents or 800,000 Roman pounds of silver), which proved successful.Pliny 33,51 Strabo reports that even in the years leading up to the Third Punic War, the otherwise devastated and impoverished Carthage had made its lands flourish once more. A strong indication of agriculture's importance to Carthage can be inferred from the fact that, of the few Carthaginian writers known to modern historians, two‚Äîthe retired generals Hamilcar and Mago‚Äîconcerned themselves with agriculture and agronomy. The latter wrote what was essentially an encyclopedia on farming and estate management that totaled twenty-eight books; its advice was so well regarded that, following the destruction of the city, it was one of the few, if not only, Carthaginian texts spared, with the Roman Senate decreeing its translation into Latin. Subsequently, though the original work is lost, fragments and references by Roman and Greek writers remain. Circumstantial evidence suggests that Carthage developed viticulture and wine production before the fourth century BC, and exported its wines widely, as indicated by distinctive cigar-shaped Carthaginian amphorae found at archaeological sites across the western Mediterranean, although the contents of these vessels have not been conclusively analysed.Smith 2008, p. 66Plato (c. 427 ‚Äì c. 347) in his Laws at 674, a-b, mentions regulations at Carthage restricting the consumption of wine in specified circumstances. Cf., Lancel, Carthage (1997) at 276. Carthage also shipped large quantities of raisin wine, known in Latin as passum, which was popular in antiquity, including among the Romans. Fruits such as figs, pears, and pomegranates‚Äîwhich the Romans called \\"Punic Apples\\"‚Äîas well as nuts, grain, grapes, dates, and olives were grown in the extensive hinterland; olive oil was processed and exported all over the Mediterranean. Carthage also raised fine horses, the ancestors of today's Barb horses, which are considered the most influential racing breed after the Arabian.Jane Waldron Grutz, \\"The Barb\\" , Saudi Aramco World, January‚ÄìFebruary 2007, Retrieved 23 February 2011 Religion Carthaginian coins showing the wreathed head of Tanit (c. 310‚Äì290 BC) Like virtually all ancient societies, the Carthaginians worshiped numerous gods and goddesses, each presiding over a particular theme or aspect of nature.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 94. The Carthaginians practiced the Phoenician religion, a polytheist belief system derived from the ancient Semitic religions of the Levant. Although most major deities were brought from the Phoenician homeland, Carthage gradually developed unique customs, divinities, and styles of worship that became central to its distinct identity. Presiding over the Carthaginian pantheon was the supreme divine couple, Baal ·∏§ammon and Tanit. Baal Hammon had been the most prominent aspect of the chief Phoenician god Baal, but after Carthage's independence became the city's patron god and the chief of the Carthaginian religion.Moscati, Sabatino (2001), The Phoenicians, Tauris, , p. 132. He was also responsible for the fertility of crops. His consort Tanit, known as the \\"Face of Baal\\", was the goddess of war, a virginal mother goddess and nurse, and a symbol of fertility. Although a minor figure in Phoenicia, she was venerated as a patroness and protector of Carthage, and was also known by the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief);Richard Miles, Carthage Must be Destroyed, Penguin, p. 68. while nearly always coupled with Baal, she was always mentioned first.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 95. The symbol of Tanit, a stylized female form with outstretched arms, appears frequently in tombs, mosaics, religious stelae, and various household items like figurines and pottery vessels. The ubiquity of her symbol, and the fact that she is the only Carthaginian deity with an icon, strongly suggests she was Carthage's paramount deity, at least in later centuries. In the Third Punic War, the Romans identified her as Carthage's protector. Other Carthaginian deities attested in Punic inscriptions were Eshmun, the god of health and healing; Resheph, associated with plague, war, or thunder; Kusor, god of knowledge; and Hawot, goddess of death. Astarte, a goddess connected with fertility, sexuality, and war, seems to have been popular in early times, but became increasingly identified through Tanit. Similarly, Melqart, the patron deity of Tyre, was less prominent in Carthage, though he remained fairly popular. His cult was especially prominent in Punic Sicily, of which he was a protector, and which was subsequently known during Carthaginian rule as \\"Cape Melqart\\".Punic: ê§ì‚Ä¨ê§î ê§åê§ã‚Ä¨ê§íê§ì‚Ä¨ê§ï, r≈° mlqrt. As in Tyre, Melqart was subject to an important religious rite of death and rebirth, undertaken either daily or annually by a specialised priest known as an \\"awakener of the god\\".Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 99. Contrary to the frequent charge of impiety by Greek and Roman authors, religion was central to both political and social life in Carthage; the city had as many sacred places as Athens and Rome.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 96. Surviving Punic texts indicate a very well organized priesthood class, who were drawn mostly from the elite sectors of society, and distinguished from most of the population by being clean shaven.Charles-Picard Charles-Picard 1961, p.131 As in the Levant, temples were among the wealthiest and most powerful institutions in Carthage, and were deeply integrated into public and political life. Religious rituals served as a source of political unity and legitimacy, and were typically performed in public or in relation to state functions. Temples were also important to the economy, as they supported a large number of specialised personnel to ensure rituals were performed properly.Miles, Carthage Must Be Destroyed, p. 68. Priests and acolytes performed different functions for a variety of prices and purposes; the costs of various offerings, or molk, were listed in great detail and sometimes bundled into different price categories. Supplicants were even accorded a measure of consumer protection, with temples giving notice that priests would be fined for abusing the pricing structure of offerings.stela with a symbol of Tanit. Carthage, Tunisia. The Carthaginians had a high degree of religious syncretism, incorporating deities and practices from the many cultures they interacted with, including Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Italy; conversely, many of its cults and practices spread across the Mediterranean via trade and colonisation. Carthage also had communities of Jews, Greeks, Romans, and Libyans. The Egyptian god Bes was popular for warding off evil spirits, and is featured prominently in Punic mausoleums. Isis, the ancient Egyptian goddess whose cult spread across the Mediterranean, had a temple in Carthage; a well preserved sarcophagus depicts one of her priestesses in Hellenistic style.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 97. The Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore became prominent in the late fourth century, following the war with Syracuse, and were worshiped into the second century AD. Their cults attracted priests and priestesses from high ranking Carthaginian families, and the Carthaginians placed enough importance on their veneration to enlist Greek residents to ensure their rituals were conducted properly. Melqart was increasingly identified with his Greek counterpart Heracles, and from at least the sixth century BC was revered by both Greeks and Carthaginians; an inscription in Malta honors him in both Greek and Punic. Melqart became popular enough to serve as a unifying figure among Carthage's disparate allies in the wars against Rome. His awakening rite may have persisted in Numidia as late as the second century AD. In their treaty with Macedon in 215 BC, Carthaginian officials and generals swore an oath to both the Greek and Carthaginian gods. Cippi and stelae of limestone are characteristic monuments of Punic art and religion, found throughout the western Phoenician world in unbroken continuity, both historically and geographically. Most of them were set up over urns containing cremated human remains, placed within open-air sanctuaries. Such sanctuaries constitute some of the most best preserved and striking relics of Punic civilization. Few specifics are known about Carthaginian rituals or theology.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 99-100. Aside from Melqart's awakening rite, Punic inscriptions found in Carthage attest to a mayumas festival probably involving the ritual portage of water; the word itself is arguably a Semitic calque on the Greek hydrophoria (·ΩëŒ¥œÅŒøœÜœåœÅŒπŒ±). Each text ends with the words, \\"for the Lady, for Tanit Face-of-Baal, and for the Lord, for Baal of the Amanus, that which so-and-so vowed.Robert McClive Good, The Carthaginian mayumas, SEL 3 1986 pp. 99‚Äì114 Excavations of tombs reveal utensils for food and drink, as well as paintings depicting what appears to be a person's soul approaching a walled city. These findings strongly suggest a belief in life after death. = Human sacrifice debate = Carthage was accused by both contemporary historians and its adversaries of child sacrifice; Plutarch, Tertullian,Aubet (2001), p .249 (Apolog.9:2‚Äì3) Orosius, Philo, and Diodorus Siculus all allege the practice, although Herodotus and Polybius do not. Sceptics contend that if Carthage's critics were aware of such a practice, however limited, they would have been horrified by it and exaggerated its extent due to their polemical treatment of the Carthaginians. According to Charles Picard, Greek and Roman critics objected not to the killing of children but to its religious context: in both ancient Greece and Rome, inconvenient newborns were commonly killed by exposure to the elements. The Hebrew Bible mentions child sacrifice practiced by the Canaanites, ancestors of the Carthaginians, while Greek sources allege that the Phoenicians sacrificed the sons of princes during times of \\"grave peril\\".Miles, Carthage Must be Destroyed, p. 69. However, archaeological evidence of human sacrifice in the Levant remains sparse.Stelae on the tophet.Accounts of child sacrifice in Carthage date the practice to the city's founding in about 814 BC. Sacrificing children was apparently distasteful even to Carthaginians, and according to Plutarch they began to seek alternatives to offering up their own children, such as buying children from poor families or raising servant children instead. However, Carthage's priests reportedly demanded youth in times of crisis such as war, drought, or famine. Contrary to Plutarch, Diodorus implies that noble children were preferred;Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 101. extreme crisis warranted special ceremonies where up to 200 children of the most affluent and powerful families were slain and tossed into the burning pyre. Modern archaeology in formerly Punic areas has discovered a number of large cemeteries for children and infants, representing a civic and religious institution for worship and sacrifice; these sites are called the tophet by archaeologists, as their Punic name is unknown. These cemeteries may have been used as graves for stillborn infants or children who died very early.Carthage: a History, S Lancel, trans. A. Nevill, p. 251 Excavations have been interpreted by many scholars as confirming Plutarch's reports of Carthaginian child sacrifice. An estimated 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 and 200 BC in the tophet discovered in the Salammb√¥ neighbourhood of present-day Carthage, with the practice continuing until the second century.Aubet 2001, p. 252. The majority of urns in this site, as well as in similar sites in Motya and Tharros, contained the charred bones of infants or fetuses; in rarer instances, the remains of children between the ages of two and four have been found.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 102. The bones of animals, particularly lambs, are also common, especially in earlier deposits. There is a clear correlation between the frequency of cremation and the well-being of the city: during crises, cremations appear more frequent, albeit for unclear reasons. One explanation is that the Carthaginians sacrificed children in return for divine intervention. However, such crises would naturally lead to increased child mortality, and consequently, more child burials via cremation. Sceptics maintain that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children who died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the tophet was \\"a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were 'offered' to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead\\".Moscati 2001, p. 141 Forensic evidence further suggests that most of the infants had died prior to cremation. However, a 2014 study argued that archaeological evidence confirms that the Carthaginians practiced human sacrifice.Kennedy, Maev (21 January 2014). \\"Carthaginians sacrificed own children, archaeologists say\\". The Guardian. Accessed 4 February 2016. Dexter Hoyos argues that it is impossible to determine a \\"definitive answer\\" to the question of child sacrifice.Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 103. He notes that infant and child mortality were high in ancient times‚Äîwith perhaps a third of Roman infants dying of natural causes in the first three centuries AD‚Äîwhich not only would explain the frequency of child burials, but would make the regular, large-scale sacrificing of children an existential threat to \\"communal survival\\".Hoyos, The Carthaginians, p. 105. Hoyos also notes contradictions between the various historical descriptions of the practice, many of which have not been backed by modern archaeology.  Society and culture  As with most other aspects of Carthaginian civilization, little is known about its culture and society beyond what can be inferred from foreign accounts and archaeological findings. As a Phoenician people, the Carthaginians had an affinity for trade, seafaring, and exploration; most foreign accounts about their society focus on their commercial and maritime prowess. Unlike the Phoenicians, however, the Carthaginians also became known for their military expertise and sophisticated republican government; their approach to warfare and politics feature heavily in foreign accounts.Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, pp. 58-61. Descriptions about Carthage's commercial vessels, markets, and trading techniques are disproportionately more common and detailed. The Carthaginians were equal parts renowned and infamous for their wealth and mercantile skills, which garnered respect and admiration as well as derision; Cicero claimed that Carthage's love of trade and money led to its downfall, and many Greek and Roman writers regularly described Carthaginians as perfidious, greedy, and treacherous. In the early fifth century BC, the Syracusan leader Hermocrates reportedly described Carthage as the richest city in the world; centuries later, even in its weakened state following the First Punic War, the \\"universal view\\" was that Carthage was \\"the richest city in world\\". The most well known Carthaginian in the Greco-Roman world, aside from military and political leaders, was probably the fictional Hanno of the Roman comedy Poenulus (\\"The Little Carthaginian\\" or \\"Our Carthaginian Friend\\"), who is portrayed as a garish, crafty, and wealthy merchant. While a simplistic stereotype, the Carthaginians do appear to have had a rich material culture; excavations of Carthage and its hinterland have discovered goods from all over the Mediterranean and even sub-Saharan Africa. Polybius claims that the city's rich countryside supported all the \\"individual lifestyle needs\\" of its people. Foreign visitors, including otherwise hostile figures like Cato the Censor and Agothacles of Syracuse, consistently described the Carthaginian countryside as prosperous and verdant, with large private estates \\"beautified for their enjoyment\\".Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, p. 63. Diodorus Siculus described agricultural land near the city of Carthage circa 310 BC, providing a glimpse of Carthaginian lifestyle: > It was divided into market gardens and orchards of all sorts of fruit trees, > with many streams of water flowing in channels irrigating every part. There > were country homes everywhere, lavishly built and covered with stucco. ... > Part of the land was planted with vines, part with olives and other > productive trees. Beyond these, cattle and sheep were pastured on the > plains, and there were meadows with grazing horses.Diodorus Siculus, > Bibleoteca, at XX, 8, 1‚Äì4, transl. as Library of History (Harvard University > 1962), vol.10 [Loeb Classics, no.390); per Soren, Khader, Slim, Carthage > (1990) at 88.Lancel, Carthage (Paris 1992; Oxford 1997) at 277. Indeed, the Carthaginians became as distinguished for their agricultural expertise as for their maritime commerce. They appeared to have placed considerable social and cultural value on farming, gardening, and livestock. Surviving fragments of Mago's work concern the planting and management of olive trees (e.g., grafting), fruit trees (pomegranate, almond, fig, date palm), viniculture, bees, cattle, sheep, poultry, and the art of wine-making (namely a type of sherry).Gilbert and Colette Picard, La vie quotidienne √† Carthage au temps d'Hannibal (Paris: Librairie Hachette 1958), translated as Daily Life in Carthage (London: George Allen & Unwin 1961; reprint Macmillan, New York 1968) at 83‚Äì93: 88 (Mago as retired general), 89‚Äì91 (fruit trees), 90 (grafting), 89‚Äì90 (vineyards), 91‚Äì93 (livestock and bees), 148‚Äì149 (wine making). Elephants also, of course, were captured and reared for war (at 92).Sabatino Moscati, Il mondo dei Fenici (1966), translated as The World of the Phoenicians (London: Cardinal 1973) at 219‚Äì223. Hamilcar is named as another Carthaginian writing on agriculture (at 219).Serge Lancel, Carthage (Paris: Arth√®me Fayard 1992; Oxford: Blackwell 1995), discussion of wine making and its 'marketing' at 273‚Äì276. Lancel says (at 274) that about wine making, Mago was silent. Punic agriculture and rural life are addressed at 269‚Äì302. Following the Second Punic War and the loss of several lucrative overseas territories, the Carthaginians embraced agriculture to restore the economy and pay the costly war indemnity to Rome, which ultimately proved successful; this most likely heightened the importance of agriculture in Carthaginian society. = Class and social stratification = Ancient accounts, coupled with archaeological findings, suggest that Carthage had a complex, urbanized society similar to the Hellenistic polis or Latin civitas; it was characterized by strong civic engagement, an active civil society, and class stratification. Inscriptions on Punic tombs and gravestones describe a wide variety of professions, including artisans, dock workers, farmers, cooks, potters, and others, indicating a complex, diversified economy that most likely supported a variety of lifestyles. Carthage had a sizable and centrally located agora, which served as a hub of business, politics, and social life. The agora likely included public squares and plazas, where the people might formally assemble or gather for festivals, religious shrines, and major government buildings. It is possible that the district was where government institutions operated, and where various affairs of state, such as trials, were dispensed in public.Cf., Warmington, Carthage (1960, 1964) at 141.Modern archeologists on the site have not yet 'discovered' the ancient agora. Lancel, Carthage (Paris 1992; Oxford 1997) at 141. Excavations have revealed numerous artisan workshops, including three metal working sites, pottery kilns, and a fuller's shop for preparing woolen cloth.Lancel, Carthage (Paris 1992; Oxford 1997) at 138‚Äì140. These findings mostly relate to the 3rd century BC. Mago's writings about Punic farm management provide a glimpse into Carthaginian social dynamics. Small estate owners appeared to have been the chief producers, and were counselled by Mago to treat well and fairly their managers, farm workers, overseers and even slaves.G. and C. Charles-Picard, La vie quotidienne √† Carthage au temps d'Hannibal (Paris: Librairie Hachette 1958) translated as Daily Life in Carthage (London: George Allen and Unwin 1961; reprint Macmillan 1968) at 83‚Äì93: 86 (quote); 86‚Äì87, 88, 93 (management); 88 (overseers). Some ancient historians suggest that rural land ownership provided a new power base among the city's nobility, which was traditionally dominated by merchants.G. C. and C. Picard, Vie et mort de Carthage (Paris: Librairie Hachette 1970) translated (and first published) as The Life and Death of Carthage (New York: Taplinger 1968) at 86 and 129.Charles-Picard, Daily Life in Carthage (1958; 1968) at 83‚Äì84: the development of a \\"landed nobility\\". A 20th century historian opined that urban merchants owned rural farming land as an alternative source of profit, or even to escape the summer heat.B. H. Warmington, in his Carthage (London: Robert Hale 1960; reprint Penguin 1964) at 155. Mago provides some indication about the attitudes towards agriculture and land ownership: > The man who acquires an estate must sell his house, lest he prefer to live > in the town rather than in the country. Anyone who prefers to live in a town > has no need of an estate in the country.Mago, quoted by Columella at I, i, > 18; in Charles-Picard, Daily Life in Carthage (1958; 1968) at 87, 101, n37. > One who has bought land should sell his town house, so that he will have no > desire to worship the household gods of the city rather than those of the > country; the man who takes greater delight in his city residence will have > no need of a country estate.Mago, quoted by Columella at I, i, 18; in > Moscati, The World of the Phoenicians (1966; 1973) at 220, 230, n5. Hired workers were likely local Berbers, some of whom became sharecroppers; slaves were often prisoners of war. In lands outside direct Punic control, independent Berbers cultivated grain and raised horses; within the lands immediately surrounding Carthage, there were ethnic divisions that overlapped with semi-feudal distinctions between lord and peasant, or master and serf. The inherent instability of the countryside drew the attention of potential invaders,Gilbert and Colette Charles-Picard, Daily Life in Carthage (1958; 1968) at 83‚Äì85 (invaders), 86‚Äì88 (rural proletariat). although Carthage was generally able to manage and contain these social difficulties.E.g., Gilbert Charles Picard and Colette Picard, The Life and Death of Carthage (Paris 1970; New York 1968) at 168‚Äì171, 172‚Äì173 (invasion of Agathocles in 310 BC). The mercenary revolt (240‚Äì237) following the First Punic War was also largely and actively, though unsuccessfully, supported by rural Berbers. Picard (1970; 1968) at 203‚Äì209. According to Aristotle, the Carthaginians had associations akin to the Greek hetairiai, which were organizations roughly analogous to political parties or interest groups. Punic inscriptions reference mizrehim, which appeared to have been numerous in number and subject, ranging from devotional cults to professional guilds. Aristotle also describes a Carthaginian practice comparable to the syssitia, communal meals that promoted kinship and reinforced social and political status. However, their specific purpose in Carthaginian society is unknown. = Literature = Aside from some ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, not much remains of Carthaginian literature. When Carthage was sacked in 146 BC, its libraries and texts were either systematically destroyed or, according to Pliny the Elder, given to the \\"minor kings of Africa\\".Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, pp. 105-106. The only noteworthy Punic writing to survive is Mago's voluminous treatise on agriculture, which was preserved and translated by order of the Roman Senate; however, only some excerpts and references in Latin and Greek remain. The late-Roman historian Ammianus claims that Juba II of Numidia read Punici lbri, or \\"punic books\\", which may have been Carthaginian in origin. Ammianus also makes reference to Punic books existing even during his lifetime in the fourth century AD, which suggests that some works survived, or at least that Punic remained a literary language. Other Roman and Greek authors reference the existence of Carthaginian literature, most notably Hannibal's writings about his military campaigns. The Roman comedy Poenulus, which was apparently written and performed shortly after the Second Punic War, had as its central protagonist a wealthy and elderly Carthaginian merchant named Hanno. Several of Hanno's lines are in Punic, representing the only lengthy examples of the language in Greco-Roman literature, possibly indicating a level of popular knowledge about Carthaginian culture. Cleitomachus, a prolific philosopher who headed the Academy of Athens in the early second century BC, was born Hasdrubal in Carthage. He studied philosophy under the Skeptic Carneades, and authored over 400 works, the majority of which are lost. He was highly regarded by Cicero‚Äîwho based parts of his De Natura Deorum,De Divinatione and De Fato on a work of Clietomachus he calls De Sustinendis Offensionibus (On the Withholding of Assent)‚Äîand dedicated some of his writings to prominent Romans, such as the poet Gaius Lucilius and the consul Lucius Marcius Censorinus, suggesting that his work was known and appreciated in Rome.Cicero, Academica, ii. 31. Although he lived in Athens for most of his life, Cleitomachus maintained an affinity for his home city; upon its destruction in 146 BC, he wrote a treatise addressed to his countrymen that proposed consolation through philosophy.Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestione, iii. 22.  Legacy  Carthage is best remembered for its conflicts with the Roman Republic, which was almost defeated in the Second Punic War, an event that likely would have changed the course of human history, given Rome's subsequent central role in Christianity, European history, and Western civilization. At the height of its power before the First Punic War, Greek and Roman observers often wrote admirably about Carthage's wealth, prosperity, and sophisticated republican government. But during the Punic Wars and the years following Carthage's destruction, accounts of its civilization generally reflected biases and even propaganda shaped by these conflicts.Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, pp. 220-221. Aside from some grudging respect for the military brilliance of Hannibal, or for its economic and naval prowess, Carthage was often portrayed as the political, cultural, and military foil to Rome, a place where \\"cruelty, treachery, and irreligion\\" reigned.Dexter Hoyos, The Carthaginians, Routledge, p. 221 (in reference to the claims of Polybius and other Roman historians) The dominant influence of Greco-Roman perspectives in Western history left in place this slanted depiction of Carthage for centuries. At least since the 20th century, a more critical and comprehensive account of historical records, backed by archaeological findings across the Mediterranean, reveal Carthaginian civilization to be far more complex, nuanced, and progressive than previously believed. Its vast and lucrative commercial network touched almost every corner of the ancient world, from the British Isles to western and central Africa and possibly beyond. Like their Phoenician ancestors‚Äîwhose identity and culture they rigorously maintained‚Äîits people were enterprising and pragmatic, demonstrating a remarkable capacity to adapt and innovate as circumstances changed, even during the existential threat of the Punic Wars. While little remains of its literature and art, circumstantial evidence suggests that Carthage was a multicultural and sophisticated civilization that formed enduring links with peoples across the ancient world, incorporating their ideas, cultures, and societies into its own cosmopolitan framework. = Portrayal in fiction = Carthage features in Gustave Flaubert's historical novel Salammb√¥ (1862). Set around the time of the Mercenary War, it includes a dramatic description of child sacrifice, and the boy Hannibal narrowly avoiding being sacrificed. Giovanni Pastrone's epic silent film Cabiria is narrowly based on Flaubert's novel. The Young Carthaginian (1887) by G. A. Henty is a boys' adventure novel told from the perspective of Malchus, a fictional teenage lieutenant of Hannibal during the Second Punic War. In The Dead Past, a science fiction short story by Isaac Asimov, a main character is a historian of antiquity trying to disprove the allegation that the Carthaginians carried out child sacrifice. The Purple Quest by Frank G. Slaughter is a fictionalized account of the founding of Carthage. Die Sterwende Stad (\\"The Dying City\\") is a novel written in Afrikaans by Antonie P. Roux and published in 1956. It is a fictional account of life in Carthage and includes the defeat of Hannibal by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama. For several years it was prescribed reading for South African year 11 and 12 high school students studying the Afrikaans language. =Alternate history= Delenda Est, a short story in Poul Anderson's Time Patrol series, is an alternate history where Hannibal won the Second Punic War, and Carthage exists in the 20th century. A duology by John Maddox Roberts, comprising Hannibal's Children (2002) and The Seven Hills (2005), is set in an alternate history where Hannibal defeated Rome in the Second Punic War, and Carthage is still a major Mediterranean power in 100 BC. Mary Gentle used an alternate history version of Carthage as a setting in her novels Ash: A Secret History and Ilario, A Story of the First History. In these books, Carthage is dominated by Germanic tribes, which conquered Carthage and set up a huge empire that repelled the Muslim conquest. In these novels, titles such as \\"lord-amir\\" and \\"scientist-magus\\" indicate a fusion of European and Northwest African cultures, and Arian Christianity is the state religion. Stephen Baxter also features Carthage in his alternate history Northland trilogy, where Carthage prevails over and subjugates Rome.Stephen Baxter, Iron Winter (Gollancz, 2012), esp. p334.

It won Governor General's Award in 1956 and the Canada Library Association Book of the Year for Children Award in 1958.Governor General's Literary Awards CLA Book of the Year for Children Award - Past Winners Plot introduction Two Against the North is an adventure story that takes place in northern Manitoba and southwestern North West Territories in 1935. It tells a coming of age tale of two boys in their late teens, one a white boy who has recently lost his parents, the other a Cree boy from a tribe living nearby. The boys embark on a mission to relieve the starvation of a neighbouring village, occupied by the Chipewyans, but due to a series of unfortunate events become trapped above the tree line in Canada's northern Barren Lands during winter. The characters emerge again in Mowat's The Curse of the Viking Grave. Plot summary The parents of Jamie died in a car accident in Toronto in the year 1931, and four years later he is under the care of his trapper uncle, Angus Macnair, who lives in Manitoba. Angus has supported Jamie's boarding-school fees for a long time, until the fur trade begins to decline. Angus no longer supports Jamie's school, which is called Saint George's. Thus, Jamie leaves the boarding school to live with his uncle. Jamie makes friends with the Cree Tribe's Chief's son, Awasin. The Chief thinks a trader is cheating him, so he asks Angus and Jamie to go with him. It is eventually decided that Jamie has to stay in camp with Awasin because Angus' canoe could not hold three people as well as all of the gear. Soon after, a group of Chipewyans come to the Crees for help. The Chipewyans had been starving for days because they hadn't been able to shoot enough deer the summer before. Awasin's Uncle Soloman is suspicious that the Chipewyans may just be looking for a free handout, and so the boys agree to go with them back to the Chipewyan's camp to prove they need the supplies. Jamie wants to go, too, so the two and the Chipewyans who came (including Denikazi, their leader) canoe back to the Chipewyan camp. There, Denikazi has a misunderstanding that Jamie and Awasin are going with them on the hunt for the deer. This is how Jamie and Awasin start their journey for the deer hunt out in the barrens. Soon, they go up to the North farther, but they do not find any 'deer' (in the book, deer means barrenland caribou), so Denikazi orders Jamie and Awasin to stay with two young Chipewyans at a certain point until they come back. He includes that they should run, and forget about the camp if they encounter Inuit. In this book, the Chipewyans and the Crees are deathly afraid of the Eskimos, who live in what some people have called \\"nothing but a God-forsaken place, the worst place on earth\\". Denikazi describes it this way: His people went and hunted as far north as they wanted to for deer, for they had guns and the Eskimos did not. Then, the Eskimos got guns and fought back. (Nowadays Eskimos are called 'Inuit' or 'Thule', but this was not the case when Mowat wrote his novel, or for decades afterward). Anyway, while staying with the two young Chipewyan hunters, Jamie decides he wants to take the chance and explore. Awasin does not agree with his idea but later gives in. They go up to see the 'stone house' that one of the two Chipewyans had told them about. They try to find it but unexpectedly meet a whirlpool and barely survive. Gathering what they can salvage from the river and their broken canoe, they have minimal belongings. Since they cannot use the canoe anymore, they are stranded in the barrens. When the two young Chipewyans found out that Awasin and Jamie were gone, they went on searching for them. Their search is abruptly stopped when they catch a glance of an Eskimo kayak. As for Jamie and Awasin, they decide to go the way that Denikazi and the other hunters went, so they can join with them on the journey back. A problem occurs, for one of Denikazi's men sees what he believes is an Eskimo and they all flee quietly back. They unknowingly pass by Jamie and Awasin's camp during the night. Jamie and Awasin are then forced to overcome a series of obstacles including finding shelter and food and to wait until the summer when they can make the trek back to their home camp with the best chance of survival. They engage in a massive caribou hunt, and are able to build a log cabin and make a comfortable home for themselves. On their attempted return trip, they both become afflicted by snow blindness and were forced to stop the trip and heal up. Then, they decide to return back to their cabin. Unfortunately, a blizzard hits and they are forced to seek shelter in an Eskimo igloo to survive. They are discovered by an Eskimo boy named Peetyuk who offers to help and takes them to his camp, where they learn that the Eskimo do not hate the Cree, and are only hostile because they are as afraid of the Cree as the Cree are of them. The boys are able to return home with the help of their new friends, and they make plans to return to their cabin the next summer with Jamie's uncle Angus. Themes Man vs. Nature: The true antagonist of this novel is Nature itself. The boys struggle to survive in a very harsh, difficult environment. The boys demonstrate true courage in hunting and even surviving an encounter with a grizzly bear. They also show great ingenuity in doing so. Awasin already has skill in hunting and fishing and also learns how to make warm clothes. He is very clever as proven by how he is able to make a fire in chapter 9. Meanwhile, Jamie is a very creative person. He is the one who designs and builds first their stone igloo and later their wood cabin. He is a 'think- outside-of-the-box' problem solver. Working together they are successful. This brings us to the next big theme: Wrong Intercultural Friendships: How do you overcome fear, ignorance and distrust between people from different cultures and backgrounds? You work together and learn to trust one another. That's how it is for Jamie and Awasin and then later between the two boys and Peetyuk. Jamie is a white English speaking city boy from Toronto. Awasin is from the Cree camp in the wilderness. He learns English while at boarding school. The two very different boys become excellent friends. Jamie helps Awasin to trust Peetyuk, even though the Cree have always been suspicious, fearful of them. Coming of age: The novel is also a 'Coming of Age' story. The two boys journey in the barrenlands is also their journey from boyhood towards manhood. They are becoming men through their adventures and experiences, they are growing up. For example, risk-taker Jamie learns some lessons about survival in the north through it all. Also, Peetyuk, a secondary character, has reached an age where it is time to learn about his father's people after being raised by his mother and grandparents. Adaptations There is a 1990 television movie version of this novel, directed by Michael Scott. It was made for a family/general audience so the hunting scenes are tame. There are also quite a few differences between the movie and the novel. Some plot differences between the novel and the movie are: *The movie is from Jamie's perspective (1st person) instead of the all-knowing 3rd person in the novel. *Jamie does not want to go north and, unlike the novel, dislikes the entire idea of living with his uncle. *The boys go hunting with Awasin's father Alphonse instead of Denikazi and the Chipewyans. Some other changes include: *Awasin is called Awasis, Uncle Angus' last name is different. *Jamie and Awasin meet on a train instead of at Angus' cabin. *Alphonse is called Mewasin. *Uncle Angus says in the movie that he does not want Jamie with him. *Unlike the novel, Uncle Angus does not send for Jamie when fur prices drop, but rather Jamie is sent north by the school because Jamie's trust fund runs out.

Induchoodan, the only son of Justice Maranchery Karunakara Menon was framed in the case by the state minister, Manapally Madhavan Nambiar and his crony DYSP Sankaranarayanan to take revenge on idealist judge Menon who had earlier given jail sentence to Manapally in a corruption case. So they set a big trap to put Induchoodan behind bars. Induchoodan, who had achieved top rank in Civil Services Examination (India) loses the post and Manapally Sudheeran, Manappally's younger son enters the list of civil service trainees. It is later revealed that Ramakrishnan the son of Mooppil Nair, one among Manappally's top supporters, was the real killer. Six years passes by and Manapally Madhavan Nambiar, now a former state minister, is dead and Induchoodan, who is all rage at the gross injustice meted out to him - thus destroying his promising life, is released from prison. Induchoodan thwarts Manapally Pavithran, Manappally's elder son from performing the funeral rituals of his father at the banks of the Bharathapuzha. Many confrontations between Induchoodan and Manapally's henchmen follow. Justice Menon and his wife return to Kerala to stay with Induchoodan. There is an appearance of a girl named Indulekha, who claims to be the daughter of Justice Menon. Menon flatly refuses the claim and banishes her. Forced by circumstances and at the instigation and help of Manapally Pavithran, she reluctantly come out open with the parentage claim. Induchoodan at first thrashes the protesters. But upon knowing the truth from Chandrabhanu his uncle, he accepts the task of her protection in the capacity as elder brother. Induchoodan decides to marry Indulekha to his good friend Jayakrishnan. Induchoodan confronts his father and prods him to accept mistake and acknowledge the parentage of Indulekha. Menon ultimately regrets and secretly goes on to confess to his daughter. The very next morning when Induchoodan returns to Poovally, Indulekha is found dead and Menon is accused of murdering her. The whole act was planned by Pavithran, who after killing Indulekha, forces Raman Nair (Menon's longtime servant) to testify against Menon in court. In court, Nandagopal Marar, a close friend of Induchoodan and a supreme court lawyer, appears for Menon and manages to lay bare the murder plot and hidden intentions of other party. Menon is judged innocent of the crime by court. After confronting Pavithran and promising just retribution to the crime of killing Indulekha, Induchoodan returns to his father who now shows remorse for all his actions including not believing in the innocence of his son. But while speaking to Induchoodan, Menon suffers a heart attack and passes away. At Menon's funeral, Manapally Pavithran arrives to poke fun at Induchoodan and he also tries to carry out the postponed last rituals of his own father. Induchoodan interrupts the ritual and avenges for the death of his sister and father by severely injuring Pavithran. On his way back to peaceful life, Induchoodan accepts Anuradha, the strong willed and independent-minded daughter of Mooppil Nair, as his life partner.

History and Description Enthroned Madonna and Child with Saints by Fra Paolino The first church at the site, built during the age of Lombard rule in 748, was a smaller temple, occupying the area of the presbytery, with an apse in the east. It was dedicated to St Blaise. In 1143, the church was enlarged by creating the present nave running along a north to south axis. The work continued into the 14th-century. The exterior is characterized by a typical Tuscan blend of Romanesque and Gothic styles, with a polychrome decoration of the fa√ßade. Over the portal is a statue of St James, attributed to Orcagna. The bell-tower, much altered over the centuries, was occupied in the 15th century by the Cancellieri family in their battles with the Panciatichi family. A chapel once at its base was frescoed in 1348 by Paolo di Stefano and in 1441 by Bartolomeo da Giovanni. The chapel was torn down in the mid-19th-century. The interior has been largely turned into a Baroque one in the 17th and 19th centuries. A Madonna and St Cajetan in Glory was painted by Paolo di Matteis for the altar of the Marchetti family, nearby is a fresco with St Agatha and St Eulalia by Gerino Gerini (painter). The altar with the Immaculate Conception attributed to Michelangelo Anselmi and Alessio Gimignani. The main altar has an Enthroned Madonna and Child and Saints Catherine, Appollonia, Mary Magdalen, Agnes, Paul, John the Baptist, Dominic, and others by Fra Paolino. It is said the a figure in profile portrays Girolamo Savonarola as St. Peter the Martyr. Two frescoes were painted by Alessio Gimignani. An Assumption of the Virgin was painted for the Franchi altar.

In Lithuanian territory meets two musical cultures: stringed (kankli≈≥) and wind instrument cultures. These instrumental cultures probably formed vocal traditions. Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of paganism faith.  Vocal music  First Lithuanian song written down along with melody by Lithuanian engineer Fryderyk Getkant (Fridrichas - Brid≈æius Gedkantas) in 1634. There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: monophony, multi-voiced homophony, heterophony and polyphony. Monophony mostly occurs in southern (Dz≈´kija), southwest (Suvalkija) and eastern (Auk≈°taitija) parts of Lithuania. Multi-voiced homophony, widespread in entire Lithuania, is the most archaic in Samogitia. Traditional vocal music is held in high esteem on a world scale: Lithuanian song fests and sutartinƒós multipart songs are on the UNESCO's representative list of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. = Sutartinƒós (multipart songs) = K≈´lgrinda dancing to a folk song in Vilnius Sutartinƒós (from the word sutarti‚Äîto be in concordance, in agreement, singular sutartinƒó) are highly unique examples of folk music. They are an ancient form of two and three voiced polyphony, based on the oldest principles of multivoiced vocal music: heterophony, parallelism, canon, hocket, and free imitation. Most of the sutartinƒós' repertoire was recorded in the 19th and 20th centuries, but sources from the 16th century on show that they were significant along with monophonic songs. At present the sutartinƒós have almost become extinct as a genre among the population, but they are fostered by many Lithuanian folklore ensembles. The topics and functions of sutartinƒós encompass all major Lithuanian folk song genres. Melodies of sutartinƒós are not complex, containing two to five pitches. The melodies are symmetrical, consisting of two equal-length parts; rhythms are typically syncopated, and the distinctly articulated refrains give them a driving quality. Sutartinƒós can be classed into three groups according to performance practices and function: *Dvejinƒós (‚Äútwosomes‚Äù) are sung by two singers or two groups of singers. *Trejinƒós (‚Äúthreesomes‚Äù) are performed by three singers in strict canon. *Keturinƒós (‚Äúfoursomes\\") are sung by two pairs of singers. Sutartinƒós are a localized phenomenon, found in the northwestern part of Lithuania. They were sung by women, but men performed instrumental versions on the kanklƒós (psaltery), on horns, and on the skuduƒçiai (pan-pipes). The rich and thematically varied poetry of the sutartinƒós attests to their importance in the social fabric. Sutartinƒós were sung at festivals, gatherings, weddings, and while performing various chores. The poetic language while not being complex is very visual, expressive and sonorous. The rhythms are clear and accented. Dance sutartinƒós are humorous and spirited, despite the fact that the movements of the dance are quite reserved and slow. One of the most important characteristics of the sutartinƒós is the wide variety of vocables used in the refrains (sodauto, lylio, ratilio, tonarilio, dauno, kadujo, ƒçi≈´to, etc.). = Wedding songs = Different vocal and instrumental forms developed, such as lyrical, satirical, drinking and banqueting songs, musical dialogues, wedding laments, games, dances and marches. From an artistic standpoint the lyric songs are the most interesting. They reflect the entirety of the bride's life: her touching farewells to loved ones as she departs for the wedding ceremony or her husband's home, premonitions about the future, age-old questions about relationships between the mother-in-law and daughter- in-law, and the innermost thoughts and emotions of the would-be bride. = War-historical time songs = Chronicles and historical documents of the 13th through 16th centuries contain the first sources about songs relating the heroics of those fallen in battle against the Teutonic Knights. Later songs mention the Swedes, there are frequent references to Riga and Battle of Kircholm; songs collected in the early 19th century mention battles with the Tatars. Songs from uprisings and revolutions, as well as anti-Soviet guerrilla resistance in 1945-1952 and deportation songs are also classified as wartime historical songs. = Calendar cycle and ritual songs = They were sung at prescribed times of the year while performing the appropriate rituals. There are songs of Shrovetide and Lent, Easter swinging songs, and Easter songs called lalavimai. The Advent songs reflect the mood of staidness and reflection. Christmas songs contain vocables such as kalƒóda, lƒóliu kalƒóda; oi kalƒóda kalƒódzieka, while Advent songs contain vocables such as leliumoj, aleliuma, aleliuma r≈´ta, aleliuma loda and others. There are several typical melodic characteristics associated with Christmas ritual songs, such as a narrow range, three-measure phrases, dance rhythms, a controlled slow tempo, and a tonal structure based on phrygian, mixolydian or aeolian tetrachords. Polyphonic St. John's Feast songs are commonly called kupolinƒós, which include refrains and vocables such as kupolƒóle kupolio, kupolio kupolƒólio, or kupole ro≈æe. = Work songs = Work songs vary greatly in function and age. There are some very old examples, which have retained their direct relation with the rhythm and process of the work to be done. Later work songs sing more of a person's feelings, experiences and aspirations. The older work songs more accurately relate the various stages of the work to be done. They are categorized according to their purpose on the farm, in the home, and so on. *Herding songs. Shepherd songs are sung by children, while nightherding songs are sung by adults. The shepherding songs reflect the actual tending of animals, the social situation of children, as well as references to ancient beliefs. The raliavimai or warbles are also recitative type melodies, distinguished by the vocable ralio, which is meant to calm the animals. The raliavimai have no set poetic or musical form being free recitatives, unified by the refrains. Some warbles end in a prolonged ululation, based on a major or minor third. *Haymaking songs. Refrains are common in haymaking songs. The most common vocable used is valio, hence ‚Äî valiavimas, the term for the singing of haymaking songs. The vocable is sung slowly and broadly, evoking the spacious fields and the mood of the haymaking season. The melodies of earlier origin are similar to other early work songs while more modern haymaking songs have a wider modal range and are structurally more complex. Most are in major and are homophonic. *Rye harvesting songs. The harvesting of rye is the central stage in the agricultural cycle. The mood is doleful and sad, love and marriage are the prevailing topics in them. Family relationships between parents and children are often discussed, with special emphasis on the hard lot of the daughter-in law in a patriarchal family. Rye harvesting songs have rhythmic and tonal structures in common, which attests to their antiquity. Their unique melodic style is determined by close connection to ritual and the function of the work. The modal-tonal structure of some of these songs revolves around a minor third, while others are built on a major tetrachord. * Oat harvesting, flax and buckwheat pulling and hemp gathering songs. Oat harvesting songs sing of the lad and the maid, of love and marriage as well as the work process: sowing, harrowing, cultivating, reaping, binding, stacking, transporting, threshing, milling, and even eating. In addition to the monophonic oat harvesting songs of Dz≈´kija, there are quite a few sutartinƒós from northern Auk≈°taitija, which are directly related to the job of growing oats. *Milling songs. The genre can be identified by characteristic refrains and vocables, such as zizui malui, or malu malu. They suggest the hum of the millstones as well as the rhythm of the milling. Milling was done by women, and the lyrics are about women's life and family relationships, as well as the work itself. Milling songs are slow tempo, composed, the melodic rhythm varies little. *Spinning and weaving songs. In spinning songs the main topic is the spinning itself, the spinner, and the spinning wheel while weaving songs mention the weaving process, the weaver, the loom, the delicate linens. Some spinning songs are cheerful and humorous, while others resemble the milling songs which bemoan the woman's hard lot and longing for their homes and parents. The texts describe the work process, while the refrains mimic the whirring of the spinning wheel. There are also highly unique spinning sutartinƒós, typified by clear and strict rhythms. *Laundering songs. Sometimes the refrain imitates the sounds of the beetle and mangle ‚Äî the laundering tools. The songs often hyperbolyze images of the mother-in-law's outlandish demands, such as using the sea instead of a beetle, and the sky in place of a mangle, and the treetops for drying. *Fishing and hunting songs. Fishing songs are about the sea, the bay, the fisherman, his boat, the net, and they often mention seaside place names, such as Klaipƒóda or Rusnƒó. The emotions of young people in love are often portrayed in ways that are unique only to fishing songs. The monophonic melodies are typical of singing traditions of the seaside regions of Lithuania. Hunting motifs are very clearly expressed in hunting songs. *Berry picking and mushroom gathering songs. These are singular songs. Berry picking songs describe young girls picking berries, meeting boys and their conversations. Mushroom gathering songs can be humorous, making light of the process of gathering and cooking the mushrooms, describing the \\"war\\" of the mushrooms or their \\"weddings.\\" = Instrumental music = Vaiguva, a Lithuanian folklore band The rateliai round dances have long been a very important part of Lithuanian folk culture, traditionally performed without instrumental accompaniment. Since the 19th century, however, fiddle, basetle, lamzdeliai and kanklƒós came to accompany the dances, while modern groups also incorporate bandoneon, accordion, concertina, mandolin, clarinet, cornet, guitar and harmonica. During the Soviet era, dance ensembles used box kanklƒós and a modified clarinet called the birbynƒós; although the Soviet ensembles were ostensibly folk-based, they were modernized and sanitized and used harmonized and denatured forms of traditional styles.Cronshaw, pgs. 22 ‚Äì 23 The most important Lithuanian popular folk music ensembles included Skriaud≈æi≈≥ kanklƒós, formed in 1906, and Lietuva. Such ensembles were based on traditional music, but were modernized to be palatable to the masses; the early 20th century also saw the spread of traditional musical plays like The Kupi≈°kƒónai Wedding.Cronshaw, pgs. 22 ‚Äì 23 Dancers in national costumes Some of the most prominent modern village ensembles: Marcinkonys (Varƒóna dst.), ≈Ωi≈´rai (Varƒóna dst.), Kalviai-Lieponys (Trakai dst.), Luokƒó (Tel≈°iai dst.), Linkava (Linkuva, Pakruojis dst.), ≈†eduviai (≈†eduva, Radvili≈°kis dst.), U≈æu≈°iliai (Bir≈æai dst.), Lazdiniai-Aduti≈°kis (≈†venƒçionys dst.).

Early life and acting career Hoevels was born in Sweden. After three years studying politics in Berlin at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, he trained as an actor at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater in Hamburg between 2001 and 2004, and acted in some films and theater productions in Hamburg during that time. He joined the Thalia Theater Hamburg in 2004, where his first roles were Huck in Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, Haimon in Christine Eders's Antigone, and the Duke of Burgundy in Andreas Kriegenburg's production of Shakespeare's King Lear. His subsequent Shakespearean roles have been Lysander in A Midsummer Night's Dream and Romeo Montague in Romeo and Juliet. From 2005 to 2009 he was part of Thalia Theater Hamburg. From 2009 on he works at Deutsches Theater Berlin. He is noted for bringing a touch of comedy to rather serious roles. Accidental stabbing On 6 December 2008, Hoevels slit his neck while playing \\"Mortimer\\" in Mary Stuart, written by Friedrich Schiller. His character's suicide scene was to feature a dull knife, though it was damaged and was replaced by a sharp one. Thalia - the theatre company - requested that the sharp one be dulled too, though this was \\"carelessly\\" disregarded. The near-fatal knife was bought at a local store and reportedly still contained a price tag. Austrian police forces are currently investigating who failed to blunt the knife. They have not ruled out the possibility of a conspiracy, and some rumors claim that the knife was replaced by a rival of Hoevels. They reportedly questioned the cast and crew and performed DNA tests. When Hoevels collapsed on the Burgtheater's stage, the audience reportedly began to clap. They thought that the blood spilling from Hoevels's neck was some sort of special effect. No one realised he was injured until he did not take a bow after the show. The actor was taken to a hospital, where he was given stitches. He survived the incident because the blade barely missed his carotid artery. Hoevels returned to acting at the Burgtheater the next day. A spokeswoman for the Burgtheater later said that reports were exaggerated and that the audience did not applaud. Police denied that an investigation had been launched or that DNA tests of cast and crew were done. =Later performance= Hoevels returned to Hamburg on 8 December. He was to play the character Willi in The New Sorrows of Young W. by Ulrich Plenzdorf. Coincidentally, the main character Edgar Wibeau was also to commit suicide in the play.

The team was considered one of the best, if not the best, professional football teams in the country from 1898 until 1900. However, the team is most famous for being the first football franchise to be owned by an individual, William Chase Temple. Origin The Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, started playing in 1895 and at first intended to use only amateur players. However, after four games, before playing the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, they began hiring stars and soon became the most professional team in the city. 1898 Duquesne fielded the best team in Pittsburgh since 1895. In 1898 the Duquesnes decided to build an even better team. After the 1897 season, the club had signed a number of good players to contracts for the next year. However at this time, many of the players went into the army in the spring to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. This led the Duquesnes to sign replacements for those players in the army. While this at first looked to be a bad sign for Duquesne for the 1898 season, it later became a blessing in disguise. Many of replacement player that were signed proved to perform better than the originals. Then when the war ended in just a few short months and the original players returned home, the Duquesnes suddenly found themselves with a load of expensive stars. In fact it became apparent that the bench-warmers for the Duquesnes would actually be star players on lesser teams. Those players; tight end Tommy Randolph, offensive tackle Otto Wagonhurst, offensive guard John Wienstein, and running back Don McNeil would have been regulars for the rival Pittsburgh Athletic Club. All- star game At the end of the 1898 season, Dave Berry, the manager of the Latrobe Athletic Association came up with the idea fielding a team composed of best players, drawn from all of the other area teams. That team would then play the Duquesnes in an all-star game. Berry was able to get many of the players that he wanted for his all-star team, but not all of them. In Greensburg, local leaders urged players from the Greensburg Athletic Association not to play in the game. Also many other players had baseball to prepare for and did not bother with the game. However, the game was a go and was arranged for Saturday, December 3 at Exposition Park. The Duquesnes would go on to win the game 16-0. First individual owner When it became apparent around this time that the Duquesnes could not survive financially while paying its players, William C. Temple, its chairman, took over the team payments becoming the first known individual club owner. However, in early days of professional football, the public wrongly viewed everyone who was playing for an athletic club, as an amateur. So the date of Temple becoming the first owner is still in question, but it is estimated by historians to be between 1898 and 1901. Several histories have tabbed the 1898 season, when the team was suddenly confronted with more players under contract than they'd expected. While others argue for 1899, when several new stars were hired to keep the team on top. The NFL's official chronology states that in 1900 Temple took over the D.C. & A.C. payments. Temple, a local steel magnate, was also a part owner and president of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Move to Homestead The Duquesnes had become the best pro team in Pennsylvania and, almost certainly, in the country. In 1900, A.C. Dinkey stole most of the Duquesne players, as well as Temple, for his Homestead Library & Athletic Club, an organization that had existed since 1894 in the Pittsburgh suburb of Homestead, Pennsylvania, offering them higher salaries. Like the Duquesnes, that team became a national powerhouse in football for the next two years. Meanwhile, Duquesne in 1900 found itself posting a financial loss, resulting in the club to fold its professional football team immediately.

Since moving to Australia, she has become one of the correspondents covering Australia for the Philippines' ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.  Education and early career  Paredes graduated from high school in 2000 at the School of the Holy Spirit (SHSQC), a private, all-girls Roman Catholic school in Quezon City. She then moved on to the Ateneo de Manila University, where she received her Bachelor of Arts in Communication in 2004. She first ventured into modeling in her junior year in college, doing a commercial for a facial wash, and soon endorsing a clothing line. Initially, Ala was perceived to have the advantage of a familiar family name: she is the second daughter of singer Jim Paredes of the APO Hiking Society. But she soon became popular in her own right, taking up social causes just as her father, well known for his advocacies, did before her. Model in Globe Telecom's TV Ad \\"ARE YOU ONE OF US?\\" early 2000  \\"Unconventional Beauty\\" In her first forays as a television personality, doing television ads, she quickly became a recognizable figure, distinguished by her morena (malay brown) complexion and curly hair, a sharp contrast to the traditional look of models at the time. The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism took note of her unusual success and said: :Model Ala Paredes has curly hair in a country where long, straight hair is considered the epitome of female beauty.... In an industry that prizes fair skin and straight hair, her morena skin color and loose, voluptuous curls are considered unconventional. At around the same time, Paredes began blogging regularly, with her blog soon becoming popular and earning her a reputation as a celebrity blogger ‚Äì a role she would later use to promote environmental issues.

She continued modelling occasionally but became a regular VJ for ABS-CBN's music channel Myx, and then later the host of IslaMusik, a television show on ABC 5 featuring a musicians from all over the Philippines. She also often served as a presenter at numerous events. As a writer, she also became an advice columnist for Pink magazine.  Hiraya vocalist  In 2005, Paredes became the frontwoman of a Pinoy rock band Hiraya when the original vocalist left. Guitarist Mark Verzo, bassist Marco Cuneta on bass, and drummer Paulo Tomas recruited her to become the replacement vocalist. The band had already released an EP, with their previous vocalist, when Ala took over. She stayed with the band until a short time before she moved to Australia with her family in 2006.  Move to Australia  In 2006, the Paredes family decided to migrate to Australia ‚Äì a decision which Jim Paredes explained was related to a desire for greater personal development. The move generated some controversy when a copyeditor for a prominent Philippine newspaper wrote a headline that said Mr. Paredes, known for his activism, was \\"giving up on the Philippines.\\" Both Jim and Ala Paredes protested that this was a miscategorization of their family's motives for moving. The paper eventually apologized to the Paredes family for the original, inaccurate headline of the article. Mr Paredes later said that he \\"felt bad not so much that people misread me as a person (that's hurtful, yes) but more so that they may slip deeper into despair by such a false story. That's the last thing we need,\\" and Ala expressed similar sentiments. = Media work and studies = Even after migrating to a new country, however, Ala Paredes continued to be deeply involved in things Filipino ‚Äì this time, specifically the Filipino community in Australia.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Pistoia and is dedicated to Saint Zeno of Verona. Most probably built in the 10th century, it has a fa√ßade in Romanesque style, inspired by other churches in Pistoia (San Bartolomeo and San Jacopo). The interior has a nave and two side- aisles, with a presbytery and crypt. A restoration in 1952-1999 returned the church to its original lines. History It has been speculated that a smaller cathedral may have existed in Pistoia as early as the 5th century, as it already had a bishop at that time. The location of such a building is however unknown: possible sites are those of the current cathedral, of the Pieve di Sant'Andrea or of San Pier Maggiore. The first mention of a cathedral dates to 923. In 998 a diploma of Emperor Otto III refers to a Palaeo- Christian building located between the \\"cathedral square\\" (Piazza del Duomo) and the city's watch tower. In 1108 the cathedral was damaged by a fire, and was probably rebuilt over the next few decades, as in 1145 an altar was dedicated in it to Saint James the Great by Bishop Saint Atto. In 1202 another fire damaged the cathedral again. In 1274-1275 the aisles were covered with vaults, and in 1287 a new altar was begun. In 1298 there was further damage caused by an earthquake. In 1336 a statue of Saint Zeno was placed in the west front, sculpted by Jacopo di Mazzeo. Between 1379 and 1440 the fa√ßade was reconstructed with the addition of three tiers of loggias and a portico. In 1504 Andrea della Robbia was commissioned to undertake the decoration of the archivolt (for which he created a festoon with plant themes and, in the middle, the crest of the Opera di San Jacopo), of the portico as well as of the lunette with bas-reliefs over the central portal, depicting the \\"Madonna with Child and Angels\\". He finished the works in 1505. In 1598-1614 the medieval choir was demolished, the side chapels were modified and the original apse was replaced by a Baroque tribune surmounted by a dome designed by Jacopo Lafri, while the main aisle was covered by new cross vaults. The decoration of the tribune ceiling was also undertaken, and paintings in the same area and in the main chapel were added. In 1721 a statue of Saint James the Great, by Andrea Vacc√†, was added to the fa√ßade. The medieval mullioned windows, replaced by Baroque windows, were restored between 1952 and 1966, and the vaults over the aisle were removed. The interior during a night celebration Interior The presbytery pavement is raised, housing the crypt underneath, while the nave and the aisles, separated by columns, have vaults and wooden truss covers respectively. The right aisle was once occupied by the Chapel of St. James (San Jacopo), built by bishop Atto in the mid-12th century to house the relics of Saint James brought from Santiago de Compostela. The silver altar of the saint can be seen today in the Crucifix Chapel. =Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament= The Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament (Capello del Santissimo Sacramento), which houses the tabernacle, is also known as the Chapel of San Donato from a painting portraying the Madonna Enthroned between St. John the Baptist and St. Donatus (c. 1475-1486), on the right hand wall. The painting had been commissioned from Andrea del Verrocchio by the heirs of Donato de' Medici and was started by him but, left unfinished, was completed by Lorenzo di Credi. The bishop next to the Madonna has been identified as Saint Zeno. In the middle is the Assumption of the Virgin by Giovan Battista Paggi (1590-1600), while next to the entrance is the tomb of Donato de' Medici (1475), attributed to Antonio Rossellino. Altar of St. James =Crucifix Chapel= This chapel contains the altar of Saint James, in embossed silver sheet, which was moved here in 1953. It was begun in 1287, when Andrea di Jacopo d'Ognabene was commissioned to make representations of the Madonna and Child for the rear of the altar, and, for the front section, of Stories of the New Testament, Christ in Majesty between Mary and St. James and Three Stories of St. James, which he finished in 1316. In addition, Pace di Valentino, a Sienese goldsmith, created some of the figures surrounding St. James. Giglio Pisano executed the large silver statue depicting St. James Enthroned (1349-1353), commissioned as thanksgiving after the end of the Black Death in 1348. The two side antependia were executed by Leonardo di Ser Giovanni and Francesco Niccolai, with Stories of the Old Testament and Stories of St. James, between 1361 and 1371. Other works include the Apostles, St. Eulalia, Bishop Atto, St. John the Baptist and Salome by Piero d'Arrigo Tedesco (1380-1390), another Christ in Majesty with St. Anthony Abbot, St. Stephen and the cusp by Nofri di Buto and Atto di Piero Braccini (1394-1398).

The pulpit was designed by Giorgio Vasari (1560). Next to the right entrance is a sculpted stoup attributed to Nicola Pisano's workshop. =Others= The Chapel of the Last Judgement houses fragments of a fresco by Giovanni da Ponte, dating to 1420-1425. The lateral wall fragments have recently been identified as a depiction of Dante's Inferno.Leon Jacobowitz-Efron, ‚ÄúDante in Pistoia: The Frescoes of the Cappella del Giudizio.‚Äù Quaderni Storici volume 140, Issue 2 (August 2012): 443-469. The crypt is that of the Romanesque building, and was originally divided into a central and side spaces by columns, and had three apses. After the construction of the Baroque tribune, the central room was destroyed and the side ones buried. After the 1960s restoration, here were found two capitals, fragments of columns, fragments of 12th-century frescoes, and two marble slabs from the late 12th century. The counter-fa√ßade houses the Arch of St. Atto, with three marble bas-reliefs from 1337. The baptismal font, to a design by Benedetto da Maiano (1497), can be seen on the left of the main entrance. In the tympanum over the latter is also a 13th-century fresco by an unknown 13th- century master, while next to the right entrance are frescoes of the Virtues by Bonaccorso di Cino (1347) and, near the left entrance, the tomb of Bishop Baronto Ricciardi (14th century).

The club which originally opened in 1942 featured big-name acts. In recent years it has been a focus of hip hop, reggaeton and salsa music. Its history is similar to that of its competitor the Copacabana. Times Square location Lou Walters, father of television journalist Barbara Walters, opened the club in 1942 at 1580 Broadway at 47th Street in a landmark three-story wedge shaped building that marked the north end of Times Square and was famed for the signs on the building's south side where Broadway and Seventh Avenue cross. Its most famous sign was the neon Coca-Cola sign. Prior to Walters, the building was home to the Palais Royale with the Moulin Rouge in the basement in the 1920s. Norman Bel Geddes had designed the interior. Following this it was occupied by the Cotton Club after it left Harlem from 1936 to 1940. Walters opened branches of the nightclub in other cities and was to sell the Boston club to Michael Redstone, father of Sumner Redstone. During Walters's tenure, the club featured big-name acts like Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Patti Page, the Carter Family, Sophie Tucker, Mae West, Diahann Carroll, Milton Berle, the Andrews Sisters, Frankie Laine and Ted Lewis along with chorus girls and concluded with a can can dance. US Army officers enjoy a night on the town at the Latin Quarter in NYC before shipping out during WWII. Walters left the business in the 1950s. Earl Wilson described the club under its new management in 1964 as \\"more expensive\\" than the Copacabana - \\"but then the show's a bit bigger, nakeder and longer.\\" In 1969, during a strike by the chorus girls, the club was padlocked for not paying rent. =Cine Lido= From 1969 to 1978, the upstairs room was a 575-seat Cine Lido that initially started showing upscale soft pornography opening with the film Camille 2000 (1969). On July 25, 1973, Cine Lido, along with 10 other New York \\"art houses\\", was raided, and a copy of The Newcomers was confiscated. Cine Lido closed in May 1978 and was replaced by the 22 Steps disco (named for the number of steps to the theatre).STAGE VIEW; Moving Ahead Into the Past - New York Times - March 4, 1979 =Broadway theatre= In 1979, it opened as a Broadway theatre called 22 Steps with performances of Coquelico, My Old Friends,http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3934 The Madwoman of Central Park West, and Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth. From 1980 to 1984, it was renamed the Princess Theatre and had performances of Censored Scenes from King Kong, Fearless Frank, The Beautiful Mariposa, Sort of an Adventure, Louie and the Elephant, This Was Burlesque, Pump Boys and Dinettes and The Babe. From 1984 to 1985, it was renamed Latin Quarter and had performances of Andr√© DeShield's Harlem Nocturne and Mayor. =Nightclub again= After 1985, it opened again as a nightclub of the same name and focused on hip hop music. Boogie Down Productions referenced the club in their 1987 song \\"Super Ho\\". Ice-T also referenced the club in his songs 6 in the Mornin' (1987) and \\"Heartbeat\\" (1988), also Slick Rick made referenced to the club in his song entitled \\"The Moment I feared\\" (1988) from the album The Great adventures of Slick Rick. In 1987, three patrons were shot as they left the club after a performance by Roxanne Shante. Later, the club was renamed the Penguin Club and became infamous for stabbings and fights. The building was eventually torn down in 1989 and replaced by a 22-story Ramada Renaissance Hotel. 48th Street between Broadway and Seventh Avenue is now named \\"Lou Walters Way.\\" The club opened again in the Upper West Side, at 2551 Broadway at 96th Street (). LQ in January 2009 In 2003, Producer Ralph Mercado (who had founded RMM Records & Video) reopened the club at 511 Lexington, at 48th Street, in the Radisson Lexington Hotel on the East Side. Although still known as the Latin Quarter, signage at the club referred to it as \\"LQ.\\" In December 2004, a fight at the club, during a Ja Rule holiday party, spilled onto the street and one man was fatally shot and another wounded in a dispute that reportedly involved associates of the Inc. Records. On November 29, 2008, former New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers football player Plaxico Burress accidentally shot himself in the right leg while he was standing in an elevator vestibule between the VIP room and the coat check. Burress pleaded guilty to charges and received a 2-year prison sentence. The recent events led to a Manhattan Community Board 6 recommendation not to renew the club's liquor license. =Notable performers= *3rd Bass *Joey Adams *The Andrews Sisters *Marc Anthony *Obba Babatunde *Pearl Bailey *Afrika Bambaataa *Tony Bennett *Jack Benny *Milton Berle *Joey Bishop *Big Daddy Kane *Big Pun *Joe E.

Background Over the last decade, numerous government and industry organizations have moved or are moving toward deploying automated biometric technologies to provide increased security for their systems and facilities. Six U.S. Government organizations recently sponsored the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC), Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) 2006 and the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE) 2006. Results from the FRGC and FRVT 2006 documented two orders of magnitude improvement in the performance of face recognition under full-frontal, controlled conditions over the last 14 years. For the first time, ICE 2006 provided an independent assessment of multiple iris recognition algorithms on the same data set. However, further advances in these technologies are needed to meet the full range of operational requirements. Many of these requirements focus on biometric samples taken under less than ideal conditions, for example: *Low quality still images *High and low quality video imagery *Face and iris images taken under varying illumination conditions *Off-angle or occluded images Building on the challenge problem and evaluation paradigm of FRGC, FRVT 2006, ICE 2005 and ICE 2006, the Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge (MBGC) will address these problem areas. Overview The primary goal of the MBGC is to investigate, test and improve performance of face and iris recognition technology on both still and video imagery through a series of challenge problems and evaluation. The MBGC seeks to reach this goal through several technology development areas: *Face recognition on still frontal, real-world-like high and low resolution imagery *Iris recognition from video sequences and off-angle images *Fusion of face and iris (at score and image levels) *Unconstrained face recognition from still & video *Recognition from Near Infrared (NIR) & High Definition (HD) video streams taken through portals *Unconstrained face recognition from still & video The MBGC will consist of a set of challenge problems designed to advance the current state of technology and conclude with a planned independent evaluation. Challenge problems will focus on three major areas: *Iris and Face Recognition from Portal Video: the goal is to develop algorithms that recognize people from near infrared image sequences and high definition video sequences. The sequences will be acquired as people walk through a portal. *Iris and Face Recognition from Controlled Images: the goal is to improve performance on iris and face imagery. Face data will be real- world-like high and low resolution images of frontal faces. Iris images will consist of still and video iris sequences. *Still and Video Face: the goal is to advance recognition from unconstrained outdoor video sequences and still images. These challenge problems will allow for fusion of face and iris at both the score level and the image level. Challenge Problem Structure Overview The Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge is based on previous challenges directed by Dr. P. Jonathon Phillips. Specifically the Facial Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) and the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE 2005). The programmatic process of a Challenge Problem is as follows. The Challenge Team designs the protocols, challenge problems, prepares challenge infrastructure, and composes the necessary data sets. Organizations then sign licenses to receive the data and begin to develop technology (mostly computer algorithms) in an attempt to solve the various challenges laid out by the Challenge Team. To advance and inform the various participants and interested parties the Team hosts workshops. The first workshop gives an overview of the challenge and introduces the first set of challenge problems (typically referred to as Version 1). The data sets are then released to participating organizations who develop their algorithms and submit self reported results back to the Challenge Team in the form of similarity matrices. The Team analyzes these results and then hosts another workshop. At the 2nd Workshop the Challenge Team reports the results from Challenge Version 1 and releases the Challenge Version 2. The cycle is repeated, finishing with a final workshop. At this stage the Participants are requested to submit not their self reported results, but the actual executables (or SDKs) to their algorithms. The Challenge Team then runs these algorithms through a battery of tests on large sequestered datasets. This phase ultimately determines the performance levels of the participant‚Äôs algorithms. A final report is issued by the Team which is used by Industries and Governments to determine the actual state of the art in a given field and to provide participating organizations a basis for showing their performance within that field. MBGC Challenge Version 1 The Multiple Biometric Challenge Version 1 was released in April 2008. This initial set of challenge problems had the following goals. *Familiarize community with problem and data. *Introduce participants to challenge protocol and experiment environment. *Grow the research community that works on these problems. *1st Characterization of the state of the art. The Version 1 series was separated into three distinct areas with various experiments under those areas. *Portal Challenge **Still Iris versus Near Infrared (NIR) **Video Iris versus Near Infrared (NIR) **Still Face versus High Definition (HD) Video **Multiple Biometrics (Fusion) ***Still Face / Still Iris versus Near Infrared (NIR) / High Definition (HD) Video ***Still Face / Video Iris versus Near Infrared (NIR) / High Definition (HD) Video Version 1 results were submitted in November 2008, and reported at the MBGC 2nd Workshop in December 2008. MBGC Challenge Version 2 Will be released in January 2009. Submitted results will be reported at the MBGC 3rd Workshop in Spring 2009. Multiple Biometric Evaluation (MBE) The Multiple Biometric Evaluation (MBE) will begin in Summer 2009. The purpose of the MBE is to conduct an independent evaluation of the MBGC submissions on large sequestered data sets.

Androcydes (also transliterated as Androkydes) was a Pythagorean whose work On Pythagorean SymbolsAlso translated On Pythagoric Symbols; Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library (Red Wheel/Weiser, 1987), p. 93 online. survives only in scattered fragments. The dating of his life is uncertain; he lived before the 1st century BCThe earliest reference to Androcydes‚Äô work appears in the 1st-century BC grammarian Tryphon. but possibly as early as the 4th. The frequency with which Androcydes is mentioned in other works indicates that he was a major source for the later Pythagorean tradition, and he is also of interest in studying the historical development of the literary and philosophical symbol.Peter Struck, Birth of the Symbol (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 99 online; Struck regards the magico-religious performative power of the Pythagorean symbol as exceeding the methodological confines of conventional semiotics. The Pythagorean symbols Walter Burkert featured Androcydes in his stemma of Pythagorean symbola,Walter Burkert, Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism, translated by Edwin L. Minar, Jr. (Cambridge University Press, 1972), pp. 166‚Äì173, as cited by Peter Struck, Birth of the Symbol (Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 98. consisting of gnomic utterances or maxims.Such as ‚ÄúEat not in the chariot,‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not urinate against the sun,‚Äù and most famously ‚ÄúAbstain from beans‚Äù; see Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library (Red Wheel/Weiser, 1987), p. 146 online and pp. 159‚Äì161 online for a full list. Androcydes was regarded as one of the most important sources on the akousmata.Felix Jacoby, Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (Brill, 1999), p. 253, note 62 online. According to Grant (2002), he has said, wine and meat do harm the mind.Robert McQueen Grant, Early Christians and Animals (Routledge, 1999), p. 13 online. Paraphrases of his work in later writers demonstrate his method of interpreting these behavioral strictures. For instance, ‚ÄúDo not step over a yoke‚Äù should be understood as meaning ‚ÄúDo not transgress justice.‚Äù These interpretations indicate that the prohibitions held arcane significance for those willing to ponder them and learn, that the symbola are also enigmata (Œ±·º∞ŒΩŒØŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±).Peter Struck, Birth of the Symbol, p. 99. The 1st-century BC grammarian Tryphon refers to Androcydes‚Äô work in a section on literary enigmata, which he defines as darkened or obscured allegories. Tryphon implies that Androcydes made no strong distinction between poetic and philosophical modes of discourse, in that he cited passages from Hesiod in interpreting the Pythagorean symbols.Peter Struck, Birth of the Symbol, pp. 103‚Äì104. The symbols and magic Androcydes treated the Ephesia grammata, or ritualized ‚Äúmagic words‚Äù used for incantations or amuletic inscriptions, as allegorical language containing theological insights, a ‚Äúcryptic form of natural theology.‚ÄùRichard Gordon, ‚ÄúImagining Greek and Roman Magic,‚Äù in Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 236 online. Androcydes interprets the words through perceived lexical and phonic similarities to Greek. His commentary on perhaps the best- known string of such syllables ‚Äî askion kataskion lix tetrax damnameneus aision·ºÄœÉŒ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉŒ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ ŒªŒπŒæ œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ±Œæ Œ¥Œ±ŒºŒΩŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩŒµœÖœÇ Œ±·º∞œÉŒπŒøŒΩ. ‚Äî is paraphrased by Clement of Alexandria: The physician?

The New Haven Collegiate and Commercial Institute (later to be popularly known as the Russell Military Academy) was founded by Stiles French in 1834 and is a defunct military academy and college preparatory school that \\"fitted\\" students to apply for entrance to nearby Yale or West Point, as well as offering classes in business skills like book-keeping. The school was located at Wooster Square in New Haven, Connecticut, USA, about a mile from the Yale campus. Founded by Stiles French after the break-up of Round Hill School, where he had been a faculty member, the school took over the large building formerly occupied by The Young Ladies Institute, opened in 1830 by Ray Palmer and E. A. Andrews, on the east side of Wooster Square, where Sarah Porter (later to found Miss Porter's School), and General Russell's future wife were students. Although Stiles French and his son Truman French continued to be involved with the school for many years, it was taken over in September 1836 by William Huntington Russell, a recent Yale graduate and school teacher who later became a well-known citizen of Connecticut as a non-practicing graduate of the Yale Medical School and as a representative of New Haven in the state legislature of Connecticut. Russell at first leased the school from the Frenches and eventually bought it outright. Charles Ray Palmer, writing in 1908 when the school was long closed and the derelict and decrepit main building, constructed in 1829 for the use of The Young Ladies Institute, was still standing, gives the following description. \\"The structure was of brick and consisted of a main building of three or three and one-half stories with two wings of two stories, the whole frontage being about one hundred feet. The interior arrangements were on a liberal scale, and well adapted to the purpose for which they were designed.\\"Palmer, Charles Ray. \\"An Almost Forgotten New Haven Institution\\". Papers of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, vol. 8 (1914), p. 20-35. Retrieved July 7, 2017. The lot was deep and over time Russell added additional buildings and a chapel, while he lived in a house on an adjoining lot. The boys drilled in Wooster Park across the street. Most of the school's students were local New Haven residents, but as the number of boarding students increased Russell rented a nearby house and converted it into a dormitory, and some students found accommodations in New Haven boarding houses. It was difficult for Russell to enforce school discipline on the boys who lived off campus in boarding houses and some boys took to smoking, drinking and carousing at night with Yale students.Pumpelly, Raphael. My Reminiscences (New York: Henry Holt, 1918), vol. 1, p. 23. In the mid-1850s the school's population was 130 students and 12 instructors, the majority of the instructors being recent Yale graduates. Although the school was opened as a family school for older boys, both day students and boarding, under the leadership of Russell it gradually assumed the character of a military school while continuing to offer both a traditional classical curriculum in Latin and Greek and a modern English language curriculum including courses in natural science, mathematics, history, and modern languages. The school's curriculum centered on a three year course for older boys preparing for college. Not all of the boys were prepping for college and there were classes in practical skills like surveying, and courses for students preparing for a business career, but all students participated in daily military drill wearing cadet uniforms. The school eventually became known familiarly as the Russell Military Academy. In 1862 Russell, who was active in the recruitment and organizing of Connecticut regiments, received a political appointment to the post of adjutant-general of the Connecticut state militia, with the rank of major general, and was thenceforth popularly known as \\"General Russell,\\" and the school as \\"General Russell's school\\" or \\"General Russell's military academy.\\" By about 1840, Russell introduced a very thorough military drill and discipline into his school. He foresaw the American Civil War in the future and wanted to make sure his boys were prepared to fight for the Union. During the American Civil War, the school of 130 to 160 pupils furnished more than one hundred officers for the Union Army, as well as many drill masters and volunteers. A small number of the school's graduates chose to fight for the South, including William Eugene Webster, the grandson of Noah Webster, who joined Lee's army in Virginia as a lieutenant, while his brother, his classmate at the Collegiate and Commercial Institute, served on the opposite side of the battlefield as a lieutenant in McClellan's Union army. Although the Websters were a New Haven family loyal to the Northern cause, the boys' mother, a grand-daughter of Martha Washington, was a proud Virginia belle loyal to the South. Their parents quarreled and separated over the war, the older boy siding with his mother and the younger sticking with his father.Guide to the Webster Family Papers. Retrieved July 18, 2017. Lt. William E. Webster was killed in the fighting at the epic Seven Days Battle east of Richmond in 1862, and his brother, after heroic labors as the acting head of a company of engineers on the Union side in the same battle, fell mortally ill of exposure and died 43 days later.\\"Lieutenant C. Stuart Webster\\", New York Herald, Aug. 12, 1862, p. 5. By the time of Russell's death in 1885, the school had become well known and had graduated around 4,000 boys. Since the Collegiate and Commercial Institute, inspired by the example of Round Hill, was one of the first schools in the United States to introduce physical training in a school and to start a gymnasium, these features attracted many boys from every part of the country. A detailed account of the gymnasium, with a floor plan and drawings of the equipment, appeared in The American Journal of Education in 1860.\\"School Architecture\\", The American Journal of Education, December 1860, p. 487 et seq.

Jim \\"Bearcat\\" Murray (born 1933) is a former athletic trainer for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the Professional Hockey Athletic Trainers Society and the Society of Professional Hockey Equipment Managers. Early life Murray was born in Vulcan, Alberta, Canada to Allan and Isabelle Murray, and moved to nearby Okotoks in 1937, where he and his family have remained integral members of the community since. The Murray Arena in Okotoks is named in honour of the family's impact on the local sports scene, as Bearcat's father was a senior ice hockey player with the High River Flyers, and his mother a leader with the local curling club. Murray earned the nickname \\"Bearcat\\" from his father, who shared the same moniker. Self-taught, Murray served first as the trainer of the Western Hockey League's Calgary Centennials and Wranglers, and later the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys. He also spent some time as assistant trainer for the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders. Calgary Flames Murray joined the Flames as their head athletic trainer in 1980 when the team arrived after relocating from Atlanta, Georgia, and held the position until his retirement in 1996. He was a part of the Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship season. Murray was famously on the ice, tending to fallen goaltender Mike Vernon while play was still ongoing, as the Flames scored a goal during their 1989 playoff series against the Los Angeles Kings. Vernon explained later that he was not hurt on the play, but went down attempting to draw a penalty after being punched by a Kings player: \\"I'm lying there wondering when might be a good time to sit up, and all of a sudden there's Bearcat kneeling overtop of me ... We'd just scored a goal with him on the ice and (Wayne) Gretzky was going ballistic. I think Bear thought I'd better be hurt or he might lose his job.\\" During a game against the Edmonton Oilers in Edmonton, Murray once went up into the stands to rescue his son Al, also a trainer for the Flames, tearing ligaments in his leg in the process. Al had been in the stands attempting to retrieve Gary Suter's stick, which had been knocked into the crowd and was being hidden by Oiler fans. Fearing things were going to escalate, Bearcat jumped into the fray himself. While being wheeled into an ambulance, Murray blew kisses for the cameras. The incident caught the attention of a group of fans in Boston, who formed the \\"Bearcat Murray Fan Club\\", and began showing up at the Boston Garden wearing skull caps and oversized moustaches mimicking Murray's looks when the Flames played there. Between 1987‚Äì91, a Montreal chapter of the Bearcat Murray Fan Club made regular appearances at the Montreal Forum when the Flames were in town. The group consisted of one Bostonian and a number of native Calgarians who were studying at McGill University and Queen's University. The original members of the 'Bearcat Murray Fan Club ‚Äì Montreal Chapter' were: John Hutchings, Micheil Innes, Frank MacNeil, Robert Meurin, Jeff Needham, and Charles Robison. Between 1987‚Äì91, Bearcat fans would attend Calgary Flames games at the Montreal Forum, wearing skull caps and oversized moustaches. Murray would often meet the group for drinks at Peel Pub or other establishments. 'Bearcat' also generously provided access to tickets as well as the locker room area after games. Although the group disbanded after 1991, they have remained in touch and often see him at Calgary Flames home games, where Murray now works as a community ambassador. Since retiring as the Flames's trainer in 1996, Murray has remained with the club as a community ambassador. He is the first person in PHATS history to be unanimously voted into the Hall of Fame.

ROW Rybnik is one of the oldest and most successful teams in Polish speedway. There is a historical link to the football team Energetyk ROW Rybnik, both using the name ROW, but otherwise the clubs are completely independent of each other.  History  Speedway in Rybnik has existed since 1930. In 1964 the multi-sports club ROW Rybnik was formed as a result of a merger between two local clubs RKS \\"G√≥rnik\\" Rybnik and KS \\"G√≥rnik\\" Chwa≈Çowice. Since then the club has undergone various changes, including Rybnicki Klub Motorowy (Rybnik's Motorcycle Club) in 1994, then reverted to its historical \\"ROW\\" prefix in 2009 as RKM ROW Rybnik, then changed the name to ROW Rybnik Sp. z.o.o. in 2012 and finally to ≈ªKS ROW Rybnik in 2013. The team is historically one of the best ever - they have been runners-up in the Polish Championship 8 times and won the title 12 times, but the last title was in 1972.  Stadium  The Rybnik Municipal Stadium is located on ulica Gliwicka. It contains 10,304 seats. The track is 357 metres long and has a granite surface.

It is also reported in Oroxylum indicum (Indian trumpetflower) and Thyme. It is the aglycone of baicalin. Baicalein is one of the active ingredients of Sho-Saiko-To, a Chinese herbal supplement believed to enhance liver health. Baicalein, along with its analogue baicalin, is a positive allosteric modulator of the benzodiazepine site and/or a non-benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. It displays subtype selectivity for Œ±2 and Œ±3 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. In accordance, baicalein shows anxiolytic effects in mice without incidence of sedation or myorelaxation. It is thought that baicalein, along with other flavonoids, may underlie the anxiolytic effects of S. baicalensis and S. lateriflora. Baicalein is also an antagonist of the estrogen receptor, or an antiestrogen. The flavonoid has been shown to inhibit certain types of lipoxygenases and act as an anti-inflammatory agent. It has antiproliferative effects on ET-1-induced proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation via inhibition of TRPC1 channel expression. Possible antidepressant effects have also been attributed to baicalein in animal research. Baicalein is an inhibitor of CYP2C9, an enzyme of the cytochrome P450 system that metabolizes drugs in the body. A derivative of baicalin is a known prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor. Baicalein has been shown to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and the quorum sensing system in vitro. It has also been shown to be effective in vitro against all forms of Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia garinii. Glycosides Tetuin is the 6-glucoside of baicalein.

Recorded at Northstar Studios in Boulder, Colorado in the summer of 1980, For the Working Girl reteamed Manchester with Steve Buckingham, producer of the title cut of the singer's 1979 self-titled album release; as with the Melissa Manchester album, the track listing of For the Working Girl balanced Manchester originals (totaling five) with outside material (totaling six). Released in September 1980, For the Working Girl received heavy promotion emphasizing Manchester's new streamlined image, the album's cover photograph being taken by glamor shot specialist George Hurrell.The Day 1 October 1981 p.18Lawrence Journal-World 1 March 1981 p.16 Also stressed in the album promotion was the album's title cut, Manchester's collaboration with Bernie Taupin famed as regular lyricist for Elton John during the first phase of the latter's career: Manchester and Taupin had met through having the same manager, and their musical collaboration \\"For the Working Girl\\" was touted as a feminist anthem in the tradition of Helen Reddy's \\"I Am Woman\\".Pittsburgh Press 6 October 1980 p.33Billboard vol 92 #41 (11 October 1980) p.39 It was announced in November 1980 that Pistol Productions, owned by Taupin and Michael Lippman, would produce a feature film entitled Working Girl based on the title cut of Manchester's current album with the singer in a starring role.Billboard vol 92 #46 (15 November 1980) p.9 However Manchester's acting career would prove to be occasional with her only starring roles onstage, her onscreen feature film credit being a small role in For the Boys (1991) as a backup singer to the lead character played by Bette Midler (Manchester had begun her performing career as a member of Midler's Harlettes backing group). Despite the promo emphasis on the album's title cut, the choice for lead single fell to \\"If This Is Love\\" an easy listening ballad which charted on Billboards A/C chart (#19) but failed to reach the Hot 100 stalling at #102. The album's second single release - in February 1981 - was \\"Lovers After All\\", a duet with Peabo Bryson, the first A-side release written by Manchester since the non-charting \\"Be Somebody\\" in early 1977. Written with Leon Ware, \\"Lovers After All\\" reached three Billboard charts - the Hot 100 (at #54), R&B; chart (#35) and A/C (#25) without sufficient impact to be considered a comeback for Manchester. A third single: a remake of the 1972 #1 hit by Nilsson: \\"Without You\\", failed to chart. Without the impetus of a major hit single, For the Working Girl maintained Manchester as a moderate presence on the Billboard album chart peaking at #68.

The first half of the film concentrates on the hero's romantic, financial, and scientific struggle. Henry Fonda is notable in a supporting role as Mr. Watson who hears the first words ever spoken over the telephone. In a pivotal scene, Bell (Don Ameche), while working on the telephone, accidentally spills acid onto his lap and shouts in pain, ‚ÄúMr. Watson, come here! I want you!‚Äù. Watson, barely able to contain his own excitement, rushes into the room and stammers out the news that he heard Bell calling out to him over the telephone receiver. Bell has Watson repeat his own words to him to confirm it, and the two men begin hopping around the room, with Watson yelling out a war whoop. The last part depicts the legal struggle against Western Union over patent priority in the invention of the telephone, ending with a courtroom victory. The final scene has the hero contemplating manned flight, under his wife's adoring gaze.

Energy minimization arguments are used to show that certain crystal planes are preferred over others, giving the crystal its shape. Theory In 1878 Josiah Willard Gibbs proposedJosiah Willard Gibbs (1928) Collected Works that a droplet or crystal will arrange itself such that its surface Gibbs free energy is minimized by assuming a shape of low surface energy. He defined the quantity :\\\\Delta G_i= \\\\sum_{j}\\\\gamma_j O_j~ Here \\\\gamma _j represents the surface (Gibbs free) energy per unit area of the jth crystal face and O_j is the area of said face. \\\\Delta G_i represents the difference in energy between a real crystal composed of i molecules with a surface and a similar configuration of i molecules located inside an infinitely large crystal. This quantity is therefore the energy associated with the surface. The equilibrium shape of the crystal will then be that which minimizes the value of \\\\Delta G_i. In 1901 Russian scientist George Wulff stated (without proof) that the length of a vector drawn normal to a crystal face h_j will be proportional to its surface energy \\\\gamma_j: h_j=\\\\lambda \\\\gamma_j. The vector h_j is the \\"height\\" of the jth face, drawn from the center of the crystal to the face; for a spherical crystal this is simply the radius. This is known as the Gibbs-Wulff theorem. In 1953 Herring gave a proof of the theorem and a method for determining the equilibrium shape of a crystal, consisting of two main exercises. To begin, a polar plot of surface energy as a function of orientation is made. This is known as the gamma plot and is usually denoted as \\\\gamma(\\\\hat{n}), where \\\\hat{n} denotes the surface normal, e.g., a particular crystal face. The second part is the Wulff construction itself in which the gamma plot is used to determine graphically which crystal faces will be present. It can be determined graphically by drawing lines from the origin to every point on the gamma plot. A plane perpendicular to the normal \\\\hat{n} is drawn at each point where it intersects the gamma plot. The inner envelope of these planes forms the equilibrium shape of the crystal. Proof Various proofs of the theorem have been given by Hilton, Liebman, Laue, Herring, and a rather extensive treatment by Cerf.R Cerf (2006) The Wulff Crystal in Ising and Percolation Models, Springer The following is after the method of R. F. Strickland-Constable.R. F. Strickland-Constable: Kinetics and Mechanism of Crystallization, page 77, Academic Press, 1968. We begin with the surface energy for a crystal :\\\\Delta G_{i}= \\\\sum_{j}\\\\gamma_j O_j \\\\,\\\\\\\\! which is the product of the surface energy per unit area times the area of each face, summed over all faces. This is minimized for a given volume when :\\\\delta \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j}\\\\gamma_j O_j\\\\right)_{V_c} = \\\\sum_{j}\\\\gamma_j \\\\delta (O_j)_{V_c} = 0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Surface free energy, being an intensive property, does not vary with volume. We then consider a small change in shape for a constant volume. If a crystal were nucleated to a thermodynamically unstable state, then the change it would undergo afterward to approach an equilibrium shape would be under the condition of constant volume. By definition of holding a variable constant, the change must be zero, \\\\delta (V_c)_{V_c} = 0 . Then by expanding V_c in terms of the surface areas O_j and heights h_j of the crystal faces, one obtains :\\\\delta (V_c)_{V_c} =\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\delta \\\\left(\\\\sum_{j} h_j O_j\\\\right)_{V_c} = 0 , which can be written, by applying the product rule, as : \\\\sum_{j}h_j \\\\delta (O_j)_{V_c} + \\\\sum_{j}O_j\\\\delta (h_j)_{V_c}= 0 \\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The second term must be zero, that is, O_1 \\\\delta (h_1)_{V_c} + O_2 \\\\delta (h_2)_{V_c} + \\\\ldots = 0 This is because, if the volume is to remain constant, the changes in the heights of the various faces must be such that when multiplied by their surface areas the sum is zero. If there were only two surfaces with appreciable area, as in a pancake-like crystal, then O_1/O_2 = -\\\\delta(h_1)_{V_c}/\\\\delta (h_2)_{V_c}. In the pancake instance, O_1 = O_2 on premise. Then by the condition, \\\\delta(h_1)_{V_c} = - \\\\delta(h_2)_{V_c}. This is in agreement with a simple geometric argument considering the pancake to be a cylinder with very small aspect ratio. The general result is taken here without proof. This result imposes that the remaining sum also equal 0, :\\\\sum_{j}h_j \\\\delta (O_j)_{V_c} = 0 \\\\,\\\\\\\\! Again, the surface energy minimization condition is that :\\\\sum_{j}\\\\gamma_j \\\\delta (O_j)_{V_c} = 0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! These may be combined, employing a constant of proportionality \\\\lambda for generality, to yield :\\\\sum_{j}(h_i - \\\\lambda \\\\gamma_j) \\\\delta (O_j)_{V_c} = 0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! The change in shape \\\\delta (O_j)_{V_c} must be allowed to be arbitrary, which then requires that h_j=\\\\lambda \\\\gamma_j, which then proves the Gibbs- Wulff Theorem.

Accessed on 19 Aug 2013 in English) is the main railway station in Hof in southern Germany and is situated at the intersection of the Saxon-Franconian trunk line (Magistrale) and the Munich‚ÄìRegensburg‚ÄìLeipzig‚ÄìBerlin line. When it was opened it formed the boundary between the former Bavarian Ludwig South-North Railway Lindau‚ÄìHof to the Saxon-Bavarian Railway on the Saxon side from Hof‚ÄìLeipzig. Today the Deutsche Bahn has classified Hof Hauptbahnhof as category 3 ‚Äì a regional hub/long-distance stop.  Lines and services  The Regensburg‚ÄìHof, Bamberg‚ÄìHof and Leipzig‚ÄìHof main lines all meet at Hof Hauptbahnhof, as does the Hof‚ÄìBad Steben branch line.  History  After the old Hof station north of the city centre was no longer able to handle the growth in traffic, the Bavarian and Saxon railway administrations built a common, large-scale, through station between 1874 and 1880 west of the city, which was both the boundary and border station between the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K.Bay.Sts.B.) and the Royal Saxon State Railways (K.S√§chs.Sts.E.B.). The new Hauptbahnhof was connected to the city centre through the new Hof tramway system, which appeared in 1901. Today buses have replaced the trams. The station comprised two halves, each of which had all the necessary operating facilities (locomotive shed, coal bunkers, locomotive depot (Betriebswerk), storage sidings, etc.). The southern side belonged to the Royal Bavarian State Railways; the northern half to the Royal Saxon State Railways. The station building was designed in 1856 by the architect, Georg Friedrich Seidel (1823‚Äì1895), for the Royal Bavarian State Railways and was, like the entire station, laid out perfectly symmetrically. The border between the two railway administrations ran exactly through the middle of the station building, along the axis of symmetry. In this building there was a magnificent royal waiting room (K√∂nigssaal). The symmetry of the station was given up on the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The superfluous and duplicated buildings were knocked down over time or used for other purposes. Above the entrance on the station forecourt and in the main hall on the track side the royal coats of arms of Bavaria and Saxony are still to be found today. The royal waiting room has been fully preserved and restored. It belongs today to the station restaurant and is used for events and festivals. Unterkotzau bridge Semaphore signals could still be seen in Hof Hauptbahnhof until 1974. On 22 September 1974 a new signal box went into service next to the station building. It was equipped with a modern relay interlocking system of the Siemens Sp Dr S 60 type with 2 train dispatchers (Fahrdienstleiter - Fdl Nord and Fdl S√ºd) and colour light signals.http://www.stellwerke.de/liste/seite311.html The signalling installations controlled from Hof include the Hauptbahnhof itself and the adjoining routes to Feilitzsch, Oberkotzau and Hof-Neuhof, as well as the stations of Hof-Neuhof and Oberkotzau (the latter only at night). The old signal box was largely knocked down. The old 'Signal Box 8' at the northern station approach (by the Kuhbogen bridge) is today the home of the Hof Model Railway Club (Modelleisenbahnhclubs MEC Hof). Hof Hauptbahnhof is located between two bridges over the river Saale. To the south the Moschendorf bridge crosses the river between Oberkotzau and Hof in the district of Moschendorf; to the north the line switches from one side of the river to the other in the district of Unterkotzau at the Unterkotzau bridge between Hof and Feilitzsch.  Importance within German rail transport  The importance of Hof Hauptbahnhof to the German railway system has varied significantly during its history. = To 1945 = During the state railway (L√§nderbahn) era, Hof was the intersection of the Bavarian and Saxon state railways, as mentioned above, which required frequent locomotive changes at Hof with the corresponding cost in staff and materiel as well as two separate groups of operating facilities. On the formation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn this expense became unnecessary. During that time, however, Hof became an important hub within the railway network between Dresden, Leipzig, N√ºrnberg, Bamberg, Regensburg and Pilsen and for regional traffic. This was due to the fact that several main lines converged here: the lines to Bamberg (Ludwig South-North Railway or Bamberg‚ÄìHof railway), Marktredwitz (Weiden‚ÄìOberkotzau railway), Plauen (Saxon- Bavarian Railway) and Cheb (Eger) (Cheb‚ÄìOberkotzau railway‚ÄìHof) as well as branches into the surrounding area. During that period long-distance trains called regularly at Hof. = Passenger traffic since 1945 = Station building After the Second World War Hof was cut off to the north and east by the Iron Curtain and returned to being just the junction between two railway administrations. The Hell Valley Railway (H√∂llentalbahn) was closed and eventually lifted, the line from Hof to Cheb remained in use only for goods traffic, and one of the two tracks on the Hof-Plauen railway was dismantled for war reparations. All Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) trains (with the exception of the inter-zonal trains from Regensburg/Munich and Nuremberg to Leipzig and Dresden and the transit trains to Berlin) began and ended in Hof. Locomotives on the interzonal and transit trains were exchanged in Hof. Trains to the German Democratic Republic (GDR) were hauled by Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotives, whilst trains from the GDR were hauled by DB locomotives. Despite that, there were no border controls at Hof; these took place on board the trains or at the border station of Gutenf√ºrst. When the GDR began to collapse in 1989 (the time of the so-called Wende or political change) trains with refugees from the German embassy in Prague arrived at Hof and were greeted there by German politicians. Following Die Wende the importance of Hof Hauptbahnhof for railway traffic initially rose once more. The Hof‚ÄìPlauen railway was rebuilt with two tracks again. In 1991 a rapid regional link was introduced between Hof and Nuremberg using tilting trains of Class 610, which were also heavily used by passengers changing from Saxony and Thuringia. Interregio connexions between Stuttgart and Dresden (via Nuremberg, Hof and Chemnitz, the Saxon-Franconian trunk line) as well as Munich and Berlin (via Regensburg, Hof and Leipzig) were introduced and the pair of night trains from Munich to Berlin and Stuttgart to Dresden met daily in both directions at Hof and exchanged through coaches. In 2001 Hof was even an ICE stop after the link from Nuremberg to Dresden was upgraded to an ICE route with ICE-TD units. Thereafter the significance of Hof for rail traffic gradually receded again. After the withdrawal of the ICE-TD trains the Nuremberg‚ÄìDresden line was downgraded initially to an InterCity route again, using Class 612 trains. In 2006 however these were replaced by regional trains that plied between Nuremberg and Hof as well as Hof and Dresden and forced passengers to change at Hof. Likewise, the Interregio line, Munich-Berlin, was reduced to a regional service (with changes at Regensburg, Hof and Leipzig, and frequent stops), which actually led to a growth in passenger traffic on the ICE line Munich-Nuremberg‚ÄìBamberg‚ÄìLeipzig‚ÄìBerlin, but meant long waits for passengers in north-east Bavaria, because to get to Munich or Berlin a longer journey to Nuremberg or Bamberg was now needed. Meanwhile, a regional through express runs every three hours between Hof and Munich. Similarly, on the introduction of a shut-down of operations on the Marktredwitz‚ÄìRegensburg route, the crossing point of the Munich‚ÄìBerlin and Stuttgart‚ÄìDresden night train pairs was moved to Nuremberg. Since the switch from an Intercity link to an Interregioexpress service, the journey time on the Nuremberg‚ÄìHof‚ÄìDresden route has been reduced by 39 minutes, even though Hof is now no longer officially a long-distance stop. = Goods traffic= On the western side of the station is the goods station with its former marshalling yard. The marshalling yard was heavily used until the 1990s and also served the industrial lines of several firms based there (including haulage firms, a mineral oil dealers with its own tank facilities and a scrap merchants). On the eastern side of the station, between the passenger station and the Saxon (northern) locomotive depot or Betriebswerk, is the railway post office hall, in which the post trains were made ready for dispatch. In addition, on the northern edge of the neighbouring station of Oberkotzau there was a small shunting yard with five tracks, the remains of another former marshalling yard which, until the mid-1920s, was linked with the goods station in Hof by a third track between Hof and Oberkotzau. After being closed for several years, a Hof haulage contractor opened a container station in about 2000 in the Hof goods station, which has been expanded several times. In the goods station today there are still twelve tracks, a hump at the northern end and a headshunt at the southern end, from which shunting is carried out. The marshalling sidings at Oberkotzau station, by contrast, were removed in 2000. Likewise, in the 1990s, the railway post hall was closed. Today only a branch of the Deutsche Post, between the former railway post hall and the passenger station, remains in operation - a relict of the railway postal services. Former Saxon (northern) roundhouse, later storage shed for regional buses = Bahnbetriebswerk Hof = After the end of the L√§nderbahn era, the northern, Saxon Betriebswerk was united with the southern, Bavarian, one. At the end of the steam age the southern facilities of the depot were knocked down and replaced by new ones. This successor to the Bavarian depot has been further modernised and extended over the decades, and is still in operation today. The Saxon facilities, by contrast, were closed in the 1970s and largely broken up after that. Only the former locomotive shed 3 has been preserved. It has been used for years as a bus garage. Until the 1990s, classes 211 (V 100) and 798 (railbus) were stabled here at Hof and, later, the Class 628 as well. After that, it increasingly lost its importance and was even threatened with closure at times. After modernisation, at a cost of ‚Ç¨4M, and expansion during 2000 and 2001 as the depot for the tilting trains of classes 612 and 605 (the latter until its withdrawal in December 2003), the future of the depot was secured. Today the Betriebswerk is the main base for DB Regio Oberfranken and the home for 45 Class 612 and 27 Class 628 units (as at 2007). A major accident occurred at Betriebswerk Hof on 2 September 2001. The ICE-TD unit, number 605 009, fell from the lifting platform (Hebeb√ºhne) and was badly damaged. The vehicle was initially kept for spare parts but, after the withdrawal of Class 605, it was taken away to Chemnitz for scrapping on the night of 18/19 April 2004 on a low loader.  Track numbering in the Hauptbahnhof  Platform (tracks 4 and 6) Hof does not have the normal platform numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Instead the platforms are numbered 1a (southern stub track on the home platform), 1b (northern stub track on the home platform), 2 (home platform), 4 and 6 (second pair of platforms), and 8 and 10 (third pair). Even on the through platforms, the southern sections are indicated with an \\"a\\", and the northern sections with a \\"b\\" (2a/b, etc.). The missing numbers are, or were, allocated to operating tracks not used by scheduled passenger services.  The \\"Old Station\\"  Today, sections of the original Hof station have survived. The station was opened in 1848 as part of the Ludwig South-North Railway and Saxon-Bavarian Railway. It was situated near Hof city centre and was thus laid out as a terminal station. In the face of rising demand for a border station between Bavaria and Saxony, the old station rapidly proved inadequate. In 1880 it was replaced by the new Hauptbahnhof and closed. The old station building stood on the site of the present-day town post office on Dr.-Konrad-Adenauer-Platz (lately Postplatz, formerly Bahnhofsplatz). The post office at first used the station building of the old station. At the start of the 20th century the station building was replaced by a new post office block, that still exists today. Directly behind the post office ‚Äì on Hallplatz ‚Äì is another large section of the original Einsteighalle (boarding hall) of the old station. Over the course of time the hall was slightly shortened. It serves today as a storage hall for vehicles of the volunteer fire service in Hof, the Freiwillige Feuerwehr Hof. In the yard of the former station on the edge of Hof's city centre there are still one or two former goods sheds. On the site of the first station the name of the restaurant, Alter Bahnhof opposite the post office recalls the existence of the old station as do plaques on the post office building and the Einsteighalle.

The stadium was in rather bad condition, especially following years of neglect during World War II. The dressing rooms were bare, there were no toilet facilities throughout the entire ground, and racing pigeons were kept by The Sentinel and a number of supporters so as to relay the scoreline to different parts of the city. History Port Vale F.C. opened the ground in 1913, and six years later were admitted into the English Football League. The visit of Potteries derby rivals Stoke on 6 March 1920 saw a crowd of 22,697 turn up to see an away victory. Other big matches for Port Vale went more favourably in later years though, as they drew 2‚Äì2 with Arsenal in the FA Cup on 29 January 1927 and beat Sunderland 2‚Äì0 on 13 January 1936, again in the FA Cup. Port Vale were forced to sell the land to the city council, under the chairmanship of Tom W.Flint after suffering a financial crisis, they received ¬£13,500. This came after the club's president Major William Huntbach died in 1943, leaving ¬£3,000 of loans to be repaid to his estate. The council initially refused to allow the club to play at their ground, but eventually relented for rent of ¬£400 a year. In 1950, the city council decided to construct a shopping centre on the site forcing the club to move to their current home of Vale Park. Ironically the club raised ¬£50,000 to construct the new stadium, leading some to question why the directors did not simply attempt to raise a relatively much smaller sum of ¬£3,000 in order to pay off the Huntbach family.What If There Had Been No Port In The Vale?: Startling Port Vale Stories!

The was the day July 30, 1978, when Okinawa Prefecture of Japan switched back from driving on the right-hand side of the road to the left. Overview Originally, Okinawa drove on the left-hand side of the road, the same as the rest of Japan. However, after the defeat of Japan during World War II, the prefecture went under control of the United States and on June 24, 1945, was made to drive on the right. Even after Okinawa returned to Japanese control in 1972, it still had its traffic driving on the right for six years due to delays in the handover to Japan and delays due to the Expo '75. However, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic that restricts each country to having only one traffic direction, all the traffic in the prefecture was changed back to driving on the left on July 30, 1978. It is one of very few places to have changed from right- to left- traffic in the late twentieth century.\\"Why do some countries drive on the right and others on the left?\\" , World Standards. Accessed December 14, 2008. The day symbolized Okinawa's return to Japan. Changing the direction All traffic, except emergency vehicles, was banned from 22:00 July 29, 1978. Eight hours after, at 06:00 July 30, traffic resumed, changed on the left-hand side. Traffic signs were changed within these eight hours.Malcolm, Andrew H. \\"U-Turn for Okinawa: From Right-Hand Driving to Left; Extra Policemen Assigned\\", The New York Times, July 5, 1978. Accessed December 14, 2008. As there were not enough police officers in Okinawa Prefecture to control all the traffic for the day, reinforcements were assembled from other parts of Japan. Most left- hand side signs and signals were installed and covered before July 30. During the eight-hour transition, the covers were removed and transferred to the old right-hand side signs. The scheme was called the , after , Okinawa Prefectural police officer in charge of 730, who \\"invented\\" the scheme. The prefecture publicized the change beforehand through the , including posters and TV advertisements. The TV advertisement featured Y≈çk≈ç Gushiken, a famous boxer from the prefecture. In the prefecture, from the late 1970s until the early 1980s, right-hand drive vehicles were often called , while LHD vehicles were called . Both expressions are now obsolete. Although rare, there are still a few \\"729 cars\\" surviving on the road. The Japanese government spent some $150 million to cover the prefecture's conversion costs, involving 4,200 kilometers of highways. This also included relocating bus stops, moving signs, replacing 1,000 buses and 5,000 taxis, as well as replacing headlights on 300,000 vehicles so that they aimed to the left instead of the right. The United States military spent nearly $500,000 to switch signs on its bases. Bus Local bus companies had to change passenger doors on the right-hand side of the vehicle to the left. The bus operators in the prefecture, namely Ry≈´ky≈´ Bus (the present Ry≈´ky≈´ Bus K≈çts≈´), Okinawa Bus, Naha K≈çts≈´ (the present Naha K≈çts≈´ Bus), and T≈çy≈ç Bus introduced more than 1000 buses in total, with subsidies from the prefecture and the national government. These particular buses are sometimes called , Many LHD buses were introduced at the time of Expo '75, held before the 730. As these vehicles were relatively new, some of them were modified to RHD with left-hand side doors. Some others were sold to countries with right hand traffic, such as China. Many 730 buses survived until the 2000s. However, most of them retired after 2004. As of 2008, both Okinawa Bus and T≈çy≈ç Bus each still preserve one, but neither operates them regularly. Aftermath There were many traffic accidents right after the 730. When turning right/left on a crossing, drivers often approached to the right-hand side of the road, although they had to approach to the left, resulting in one bus overturning. This led to many collisions on a crossing. Larger accidents included a frontal collision of two buses.

In January 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Terry Bracy Assistant Secretary of Transportation. From 1977 to 1979, Bracy was a major player in the advent of airbags in cars, and of the nation's first fuel economy standards. He was also the department's liaison to Congress, to the White House, to the nation's governors and mayors, and to the press. Bracy led the effort to put the first user fee on America's waterway system, and in 1979 he led the first Federal effort to \\"reinvent the auto\\" and modernize Detroit.

Several elected officials issued formal statements about Bracy's contributions to the Udall Foundation. \\"Terry's dedicated service has been critical to advancing the tremendous legacies of Mo and Stewart Udall,\\" said Senator John McCain of Arizona. \\"I wish him the best.\\" \\"Terry served many years to make sure the Udall legacy would be enshrined in the national consciousness, not just today but in the future,\\" said Congressman Ra√∫l Grijalva of Arizona. \\"He has the sincere thanks of all of us who know how important the Udall Foundation and its work are to this country. I was happy to work with him, and he will be missed.\\" Senator Mark Udall of Colorado made a statement on the floor of the U.S. Senate about Bracy. \\"In light of his impending retirement from the Udall Foundation board, it is fitting that we commemorate Terry's groundbreaking work on behalf of the foundation.\\" http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi- bin/TEXTgate.cgi?WAISdocID=UuvAkw/0/1/0&WAISaction;=retrieve In addition, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico made a similar floor statement, noting \\"The Udall Foundation would not be what it is today without the tireless work of one man--Terrence L. Bracy.\\" There was significant media attention regarding Bracy stepping down. On the occasion of his retirement, an annual award was created in Bracy's honor. The Terrence L. Bracy Distinguished Alumnus Award recognizes outstanding contributions from Udall alumni in four principal areas of public service: conflict resolution, environmental work, health care (including social services), and tribal public policy. Bracy was married to Nancy Kay Muhlitner in 1966. They have two sons, Michael and Timothy, and three grandchildren.  Education and work  In 1964, Bracy received his undergraduate degree from St. Louis University. He received his graduate degree in political science from the University of Arizona. Bracy has written numerous articles on public affairs issues for many periodicals, including The New York Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and The Washington Post.http://www.btbv.com/tbracy.html He is a frequent op-ed contributor to the Arizona Daily Star. Bracy has frequently testified before Congress. Early in his career, Bracy was news editor at the NBC affiliate in Tucson, Arizona. He also taught courses in American government at the University of Arizona. Bracy has been a guest lecturer at the Brookings Institution, Harvard University, the University of Missouri, and St. Louis University. In 2010, he was named Special Lecturer, Washington Program, at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.http://www.btbv.com Terry Bracy also played a key role in the adoption of the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act that has largely restored the fisheries and ecosystem of the Elwha River basin in Washington State. On September 17, 2011, numerous officials and Lower Elwha Klallam tribal members attended a ceremony kicking off the demolition of two dams on the Elwha River. At a dinner the night before in Port Angeles, Washington, former Senator Bill Bradley delivered formal remarks and discussed Bracy's work on the Elwha. In a written evaluation of his work, Assoc. Prof. Wesley G. Pippert, director-emeritus of Missouri Journalism's Washington Program, said: \\"Bracy's skill and abilities are as keen in a classroom as they have been in Congress, the Cabinet, and the business world. He has a passion for helping young people, including students from all cultures, to get ahead. His seminars have been one of the highlights of our Washington Program.\\"  References   External links  * Morris K. Udall and Stewart L.

It is written in vector notation as :\\\\vec r \\\\cdot \\\\vec n_0 - d = 0.\\\\, The dot \\\\cdot indicates the scalar product or dot product. The vector \\\\vec n_0 represents the unit normal vector of E or g, that points from the origin of the coordinate system to the plane (or line, in 2D).

Background In 2002, when the word \\"deflation\\" began appearing in the business news, Bernanke, then a governor on the Board of the Federal Reserve, gave a speech about deflation entitled \\"Deflation: Making Sure \\"It\\" Doesn't Happen Here.\\"Speech, Bernanke -Deflation- November 21, 2002 In that speech, he assessed the causes and effects of deflation in the modern economy. Bernanke states: > \\"The sources of deflation are not a mystery. Deflation is in almost all > cases a side effect of a collapse of aggregate demand ‚Äì a drop in spending > so severe that producers must cut prices on an ongoing basis in order to > find buyers. Likewise, the economic effects of a deflationary episode, for > the most part, are similar to those of any other sharp decline in aggregate > spending‚Äînamely, recession, rising unemployment, and financial stress.\\" Bernanke doctrine Bernanke emphasized that Congress gave the Fed responsibility for preserving price stability (among other objectives), which implies avoiding deflation as well as inflation. He stated that deflation is always reversible under a fiat money system. Where currency is under a monopoly of issuance, or where there is a regulated system of issuing currency through banks which are tied to a central bank, the monetary authority has the ability to alter the money supply and thus influence the interest rate (to achieve monetary policy goals). Bernanke asserted that the Fed \\"has sufficient policy instruments to ensure that any deflation that might occur would be both mild and brief\\". To combat deflation, Bernanke provided a prescription for the Federal Reserve to prevent it. He identified seven specific measures that the Fed can use to prevent deflation. 1) Increase the money supply (M1 and M2). > \\"The US government has a technology, called a printing press, that allows it > to produce as many dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost.\\" \\"Under a > paper-money system, a determined government can always generate higher > spending and, hence, positive inflation.\\" 2) Ensure liquidity makes its way into the financial system through a variety of measures. > \\"The U.S. government is not going to print money and distribute it willy- > nilly ...\\"although there are policies that approximate this behavior.\\" 3) Lower interest rates ‚Äì all the way down to 0 per cent. Bernanke observed that people have traditionally thought that, when the funds rate hits zero, the Federal Reserve will have run out of ammunition. However, by imposing yields paid by long-term Treasury Bonds, > \\"a central bank should always be able to generate inflation, even when the > short-term nominal interest rate is zero ...[this] more direct method, which > I personally prefer, would be for the Fed to announce ceilings for yields on > all longer-maturity Treasury debt.\\" He noted that Fed had successfully engaged in \\"bond-price pegging\\" following the Second World War. 4) Control the yield on corporate bonds and other privately issued securities. Although the Federal Reserve cannot legally buy these securities (thereby determining the yields), it can, however, simulate the necessary authority by lending dollars to banks at a fixed term of 0 per cent, taking back from the banks corporate bonds as collateral. 5) Depreciate the U.S. dollar. Referring to U.S Monetary Policy in the 1930s under Franklin Roosevelt, he states that: > \\"This devaluation and the rapid increase in money supply ... ended the U.S. > deflation remarkably quickly.\\" 6) Execute a de facto depreciation by buying foreign currencies on a massive scale. > \\"The Fed has the authority to buy foreign government debt ... [t]his class > of assets offers huge scope for Fed operations because the quantity of > foreign assets eligible for purchase by the Fed is several times the stock > of U.S. government debt.\\" 7) Buy industries throughout the U.S. economy with \\"newly created money\\". In essence, the Federal Reserve acquires equity stakes in banks and financial institutions. In this \\"private-asset option,\\" the Treasury could issue trillions in debt and the Fed would acquire it, still using newly created money.

The Game feature four modes: Head 2 Head, Two-Player Mode, Shap Shooter and Power Shot. In Head 2 Head mode the player is pitted against the goalie in a five-puck shootout. The player has to race against the clock to post the most goals in the fastest time. Head 2 Head includes three different difficulties and 3 different goalies. Two-Player Mode includes support for two Remotes, with players taking turns at being the goalie and the shot taker to see who can score the most goals after five tries. In Sharp Shooter mode players have to hit targets in three different difficulty levels. The game ends when the player has failed to hit a target three times. In Power Shot mode players have three attempts to hit the fastest shots they can and make the high score table.

He was born at a croft in Sel, and was a manual laborer in Norway before emigrating to the United States in 1887. There, he studied and took a teacher education. He worked as a teacher in Minnesota and Dakota. For the next two years he worked in the press, editing the magazine Nye Nordmanden and Fremad.Hoerder, Dirk, and Christiane Harzig. Migrants from Northern Europe. The immigrant labor press in North America, 1840s-1970s. New York: Greenwood Press, 1987. p. 188. He was also a correspondent for the newspaper Labour Leader, having been influenced by Keir Hardie and socialism in general. Upon his return to Norway in 1897, he became affiliated with the Labour Party, and was hired in their newspaper Social-Demokraten. He was involved in the Second International from 1900 to 1906, being a delegate at the International Socialist Congress, Paris 1900 and the International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904. He is well known for translating \\"The Internationale\\" and the Communist Manifesto into Norwegian. He continued writing for Labour Leader, in addition to Sozialistische Monathefte, Avanti and Decorah-Posten. From 1901 to 1903 he edited Det 20de Aarhundre, a Labour partisan periodical. He then edited Social-Demokraten from 1903 to 1906. He was also a member of Kristiania city council from 1904 to 1907. Because of disagreements in the party, in 1906 he reverted to being a journalist in Social-Demokraten. He briefly edited Smaalenenes Socialdemokrat before establishing the newspaper Demokraten in Hamar in 1909. In Demokraten Kringen had a certain personal drive, as he stood on the ballot in the 1909 Norwegian parliamentary election in the constituency S√∏ndre Hedemarken. When he failed at being elected, he is said to have lost interest to a certain degree. He backed out in early 1912. In 1921 the Labour Party was split in two, as a social democratic wing did not favor the party's recent adaption of the Conditions of Admission to the Communist International. Kringen joined the newly formed party, the Social Democratic Labour Party. He briefly edited the newspaper Tr√∏ndelag Social-Demokrat. He soon backed out of partisan politics. He died in October 1951 in Oslo.

This was Manchester's sixth album and fourth and final collaboration with producer Vini Poncia, who had produced her 1975 commercial breakthrough, Melissa. After the first of Manchester's two 1976 album releases, Better Days and Happy Endings, failed to consolidate her stardom, Arista had attempted to restore Manchester's chart fortunes by making the lead single from the subsequent Help Is on the Way album not a Manchester original, but rather the Michael Franks composition \\"Monkey See, Monkey Do\\". This strategy proving unsuccessful, Arista then had Manchester record Singin'... which eschewed Manchester's songwriting ‚Äì save for one track: \\"No One's Ever Seen This Side of Me\\" ‚Äì in favor of outside material, including remakes of hits by Michael Jackson (\\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\"), Sly and the Family Stone (\\"Stand\\"), Three Dog Night (\\"Let Me Serenade You\\") and the Beach Boys (\\"The Warmth of the Sun\\"). The track listing was completed by Manchester's versions of songs written and previously recorded by James Taylor (\\"You Make It Easy\\") and Wendy Waldman (\\"My Love Is All I Know\\") and a new song: \\"Sad Eyes\\", written by David Spinozza, who played guitar on the album. Upon its 1977 summer release, Singin'... failed to boost Manchester's faded chart presence, with the release of \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\" as a single being overlooked. However, the track did attract the attention of the song's composer Leon Ware, who became Manchester's producer for what would ultimately prove to be her comeback album, Don't Cry Out Loud (although that album's top ten hit title cut would be produced by Harry Maslin).

The rank is equivalent to a lieutenant in the Royal Navy and to a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force. The rank of captain in the Royal Navy is considerably more senior (equivalent to the Army/RM rank of colonel) and the two ranks should not be confused. In the 21st-century British Army, captains are often appointed to be second-in-command of a company or equivalent sized unit of up to 120 soldiers. History A rank of second captain existed in the Ordnance at the time of the Battle of Waterloo. From 1 April 1918 to 31 July 1919, the Royal Air Force maintained the junior officer rank of captain. RAF captains had a rank insignia based on the two bands of a naval lieutenant with the addition of an eagle and crown above the bands. It was superseded by the rank of flight lieutenant on the following day.

After the Crimean War a new rank system was introduced which contained the first complete rank insignia in British Army history. A captain's rank insignia was worn on the collar and displayed a crown and a pip (which is now the rank insignia for a lieutenant-colonel). The rank insignia were returned to the shoulder boards in 1880 for all officers in full dress, when the system of crowns and stars was reorganised. From this time, until 1902, a captain had just two stars. The 1902 change gave captains three stars, which continues to be used. In addition to the shoulder badges, officers' ranks were also reflected in the amount and pattern of gold lace worn on the cuffs of the full-dress tunic. From 1902, a complex system of markings with bars and loops in thin drab braid above the cuff (known irreverently as the asparagus bed) was used at first but this was replaced in the same year by a combination of narrow rings of worsted braid around the cuff, with the full-dress style shoulder badges on a three-pointed cuff flap. Based on equivalent naval ranks, captains had two rings of braid. In the case of Scottish regiments, the rings were around the top of the gauntlet-style cuff and the badges on the cuff itself. During World War I, some officers took to wearing similar jackets to the men, with the rank badges on the shoulder, as the cuff badges made them conspicuous to snipers. This practice was frowned on outside the trenches but was given official sanction in 1917 as an alternative, being made permanent in 1920 when the cuff badges were abolished.

It has over 440 members from start-ups to established merchants. Liv-ex supplies them with data, trading and logistics services. The platform publishes the actual prices at which wines are transacted and contains over ¬£60m of firm buying and selling opportunities in over 15,000 wines. All are available to trade in real-time. Liv-ex additionally conceived the Standard-In-Bond (SIB) contract to assure stock condition, delivery and faster payments and provide transport and storage. The company was founded in 2000 by two stockbrokers, James Miles and Justin Gibbs. It started with a group of 10 founding members in London  Trading  Liv-ex's global network enables members to trade with other merchants worldwide. Trading on Liv-ex is reserved for professional buyers and sellers of fine wine, and is standardised and anonymous. The total value of bids and offers on Liv-ex surpasses ¬£70million.  Data  Liv-ex data is based on the activity of over 475 fine wine merchants based in 40 countries worldwide. Their activity accounts for an estimated 95% of fine wine turnover globally. Trades, price updates, bids and offers are standardised, verified and published as tens of millions of historic lines, with thousands of daily updates of reliable, independent and trusted data. The data is based on real merchant transactions, rather than advertised prices which can be inaccurate and out of date. Liv-ex data is regularly quoted by media outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg.  Logistics  With operations across the UK, Europe and Asia, Liv-ex provides its members with settlement and transport services. All services are charged at a flat per unit rate (with no minimum quantity). All wine traded on the market passes through the Liv-ex warehouse in London. The warehouse is temperature controlled and highly secure. Wine stored in the warehouse can be traded on Liv-ex, without the need to be moved or checked again. Transfer of ownership can be instant.  Liv-ex Products  Liv-ex has a number of online products. =LWIN= LWIN (Liv-ex Wine Identification Number) is the universal wine identifier. Liv-ex created it in 2011 to provide a standardised numbering system that is designed to avoid error in communication, transfer and referencing. It removes the need to rely on written descriptions and provides the key to establishing which item in one database corresponds to which item in another database, which is helpful in transactions between organisations. The unique seven-digit numerical code is designed to quickly and accurately identify an individual fine wine product. It enables messaging between systems and over the internet, allowing the trade to share information more easily. Each LWIN refers to the wine itself i.e. the producer, brand or vineyard. The first six numbers of the code represent each wine's unique identifier, while the seventh number is a ‚Äúcheck digit‚Äù that minimises input errors. Additional information including the vintage, pack and bottle size can be appended to the LWIN in a standard format. The LWIN standards for including additional data are: * LWIN: 1234567 ‚Äì Example winery, Cabernet * LWIN-11: 12345672012 ‚Äì Example Winery, Cabenet, 2012 * LWIN-16: 1234567201200750 ‚Äì Example Winery, Cabernet, 2012, 750ml bottle sizeLWIN-18: 123456720121200750 ‚Äì Example Winery, Cabernet, 2012, 12 bottles of 750ml For Liv-ex, LWINs are a foundation for the fine wine Exchange, from managing and sharing price data to maintaining the efficiency of their settlement and distribution services. =Wine Matcher= Wine Matcher is a web-based, artificial intelligence tool that allows merchants to take lists and transform them into a standardised set of wine names and formats with unique IDs (LWINs). These IDs can easily be shared with other systems or entered into a database for comparison in a matter of minutes. It can also return the clean list with wine price data ‚Äì such as Market Price or last trade ‚Äì from Liv-ex. In 2017, Wine Matcher was awarded ‚ÄòSupply Chain Initiative of the Year‚Äô by The Drinks Business. The judges called it a ‚Äúvery clever innovation‚Äù that ‚Äúhas far-reaching and practical implications for the fine wine trade‚Äù. =Automation= Liv-ex Automation allows members to automate their interactions with Liv-ex. The technology that makes this work is known collectively as APIs (Application Programming Interface). APIs allow Liv-ex's platform to communicate with merchants' system or website, without any need for human intervention. Liv-ex provides its members with market analysis, including in-depth reports and market updates. They cover new releases in their News and Insights section, as well as weekly trade, and interviews with important figures in the wine industry. Liv-ex also publishes annual coverage on the Bordeaux En Primeur campaign, as well as Power 100 ‚Äì their list of the most powerful brands in the fine wine market in conjunction with The Drinks Business.  Liv-ex Indices  Liv-ex produces a number of fine wine indices that track prices for given groups of wines. =Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index= The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index tracks the daily price movement of the most heavily traded commodities in the fine wine market ‚Äì the Bordeaux First Growths.

These are the Chicago Tafia, the Cambrian Benevolent Society of Chicago, and the Women‚Äôs Welsh Club of Illinois.  The Cambrian Benevolent Society of Chicago  The Cambrian Benevolent Society of Chicago (CBS) is the oldest Welsh society in Chicago. It was founded in 1853 to 'afford pecuniary relief to Welsh people and their descendants...in indigent circumstances...and also for the purpose of effecting the social improvement of its members' (CBS by- laws 1906). Relief was provided to individuals and families who fell on hard times and every Welsh man, woman or child who died in the city or surrounding area without sufficient funds for a funeral was properly and respectfully buried. Money was raised through annual dues, tickets to concerts and picnics and from generous donations of members. It is one of the oldest cultural societies in Illinois. Officers and members of the society helped to organize an international eisteddfod (Welsh cultural festival) in Chicago in September 1893 on the grounds of the 'White City' at the World's Fair and Columbian Exposition. The society holds an annual St. David's Day banquet around March 1, organizes a summer picnic, and mans a booth at Celtic Fest in Grant Park, Chicago in September to promote Wales and to educate Chicagoans about Wales and the Welsh. In November members of the society decorate the Welsh tree at the Museum of Science & Industry's annual 'Christmas Around the World' exhibition with symbols of Wales e.g. harps, red dragons, lovespoons, daffodils, and in the spring they hold a traditional Cymanfa Ganu (Singing Festival) in a local church to celebrate their love of singing. Board members are currently working on a project to catalogue Welsh graves in local cemeteries.  The Women‚Äôs Welsh Club of Illinois  The Women's Welsh Clubs of America originated in Cleveland, Ohio in 1914. Plans for the Illinois Club began in early spring of 1955 when a committee met at the home of Estelle Roberts Schubert. It was then called the Welsh Women's Club. The first open meeting was held on June 20, 1955 at the Carleton Hotel in Oak Park. There were 63 women present. Within a short time 61 of them became charter members and many more joined that first year. The first President of the Women's Welsh Club of Illinois was Miss Myra Thomas. The Illinois Club is one of only a handful remaining in the country and continues to meet regularly.  The Chicago Tafia Welsh Society  The Chicago Tafia is an expatriate Welsh group that was formed in Chicago in 1999. As one of the youngest and consequently the most contemporary Welsh groups in North America, they are well-known to provide a real link to the present culture of Wales to the Chicago area. The group‚Äôs activities are varied with social get-together s to watch Welsh sporting events and musicians in addition to the typical cultural events such as St. David‚Äôs Day. That is not to say that the traditional elements of Welsh culture are taken for granted by the group, over the years they have been involved with over a dozen concerts for Welsh male voice choirs in the Chicago area, including the Pendyrus, Penrhyn, Bangor, Black Mountain, Burlington and CF1 choirs at prominent Chicago venues. In 2007 the group scored a double hit by attracting the former lead singer of Catatonia, Cerys Matthews to entertain the group at their annual St. David‚Äôs Day party and also the passing of Illinois General Assembly signing into law Bill HR0149 that proclaimed March 1, 2007, and each year thereafter, as St. David's Day in the State of Illinois and recognizing the Welsh contribution to the state. From 2009 to 2016 The Chicago Tafia partnered with the owners of the iconic Wrigley Building to illuminate the tower red, white, and green (the colours of the Welsh flag) on Saint Davids Day on Sunday, March 1. An offshoot of the Chicago Tafia is the Chicago Swansea City Supporters Club.

The database currently contains data from 450 speakers representing 75 geographical areas. Each speaker is recorded in various speech situations (reading aloud a word list and a text, guided conversation, spontaneous conversation). The data made available in the PFC corpus includes demographic information about each speaker, the sound files, an orthographic transcription, and several types of annotation. In particular, special encodings are used to indicate speakers' pronunciation of schwa and liaison. The corpus is meant to be a resource for linguistic research into French phonology and a source for the development of tools for teaching French as a foreign language.

He is currently a free agent. Club career =Early career= Mouyokolo was born in Melun, France to Congolese parents. He began his senior football career at Ligue 2 side LB Ch√¢teauroux. He made his way up to the first team in 2006, but never made a first team appearance for the club, and in 2007 he joined fellow Ligue 2 side FC Gueugnon. He made 22 first team appearances for his new club, and his impressive displays from central defence earned him a move to US Boulogne, also of Ligue 2. The defender made a bright start to the 2008‚Äì09 Ligue 2 season, helping his team to second in the table by December. His performances caught the attention of English Premier League teams Newcastle United, Wigan Athletic, Middlesbrough, Bolton Wanderers and Arsenal. =Hull City= However, it was Hull City who agreed a fee with Boulogne for the defender on 30 January 2009, but the transfer would not take place until the summer. Mouyokolo officially signed a four-year deal for his new club on 2 June 2009, after helping his former club to promotion to French Ligue 1 for the first time in their history. He scored to earn a 1‚Äì1 draw against eventual champions Chelsea on 2 February 2010, but was part of the team that ended up relegated to The Championship. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= Mouyokolo remained in the English Premier League when he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 18 June 2010 in a four-year deal (with the option of a fifth year) for a fee which was undisclosed but reported in the local media as being ¬£2.5 million. His Wolves debut came in the League Cup tie with Notts County at Molineux on 21 September 2010. He struggled to make an impression in his first season, making only seven appearances in all competitions. With opportunities limited at Wolves, in June 2011 Mouyokolo was sent on loan to Ligue 1 side Sochaux, with the option to buy the player at the end of the loan. Wolves manager Mick McCarthy said at the time: \\"We saw huge potential in Steven but he has had injury problems that have limited his opportunities.\\" However, Mouyokolo only managed four appearances for Sochaux in a season marred by injury, including a ruptured cruciate ligament suffered in February 2012, before he returned to Wolves at the end of the season. On 30 January 2013 his contract at Wolves was terminated by mutual consent, making him a free agent after just seven appearances for the club. Mouyokolo says his injury made him realized how lucky he is a footballer. =Celtic= On 16 July 2013, Mouyokolo signed for Scottish Premier League champions Celtic, after impressing on trial in a series of pre-season games. Mouyokolo says Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink played a role of helping him join the club. He made his Celtic debut in a 2‚Äì0 win against Aberdeen. Mouyokolo went on to make his European debut for the club only three days later against Shakhtar Karagandy in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League play off round. Soon his career at Celtic wasn't as he planned when he sustained Achilles tendon after picking up the injury in training. After a six-month out, Mouyokolo returns to first team action, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2‚Äì0 victory against Dundee United on 5 April 2014. After an injury stricken season with Celtic, Mouyokolo left the club during the summer transfer window after his one-year contract expired.

As the Imperial Minister of War, he was killed by a mob at the beginning of the Vienna Uprising. Biography Latour was born at Linz the son of Count Maximilian Anton Karl Baillet de Latour (17371806), a Feldmarschall-Leutnant in Austrian service during the Revolutionary Wars of Walloon descent. After a military and engineering training at the Theresian Military Academy, he entered the corps of engineers in 1799 and became a member of the general staff of the Austrian Imperial and Royal Army in 1804. Latour took part in various military campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars in which he distinguished himself and was highly decorated. During European Restoration he filled an array of leadership roles in the military ranks up to a Feldzeugmeister, and in addition served as the head of the military commission attached to the Bundesversammlung (assembly) of the German Confederation at Frankfurt, contributed to the design of the fortifications at Rastatt, and finally was director of engineering. In the Revolutions of 1848 he was called to head the war ministry in the cabinet of Minister-President Count Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont, whose direction he saw to without regard to his advanced years. A distinct asserter of conservatism, his efforts especially sought to give the public no cause for unrest. Faced with the Hungarian Revolution, Latour backed the loyal forces of Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá and arranged troops to second his campaign. These efforts sparked the Vienna Uprising: On 6 October 1848 a crowd of students, workers and mutinous soldiers forcibly tried to prevent the troops marching off. In the following street fights, an outraged mob sought Latour out in the war ministry and lynched him.

That year, Rennie's book of short stories, Evil, was released by Chicago publisher Black Hole Press.

Their latest album, Unseen was released in September 2016. The track \\"Far from Any Road,\\" from the album Singing Bones, was used as the main title theme song for HBO's 2014 crime drama True Detective by the show's music director, T Bone Burnett.

Early recordings have rock elements, but these were less evident from 1996's Milk and Scissors onwards. The duo's penchant for a tongue-in-cheek, macabre approach to alt-country has been noted by many critics; Andy Fyfe of Mojo called them \\"Americana's ghostly Sonny & Cher.\\" A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn described their music as \\"rootsy, literary country-rock that‚Äôs a little like a collaboration between Hank Williams and Edgar Allan Poe.\\" Rennie's lyrics have a strong storytelling component, drawing on themes from Gothic fiction, as well as American folk music, and often involving macabre subjects as murders, suicides and ghosts. Some songs are also based on actual historical figures or events, including the lives and deaths of Amelia Earhart (\\"Amelia Earhart vs. the Dancing Bear\\", on Milk and Scissors), Emily Shore (\\"Emily Shore 1819‚Äì1839\\", on Milk and Scissors), Robert Wadlow (\\"The Giant of Illinois\\", on Through the Trees), Natalie Wood (\\"Natalie Wood\\", an outtake from Twilight, which appears on Smothered and Covered), and Nikola Tesla (\\"Tesla's Hotel Room\\", on Last Days of Wonder). The title of Last Days of Wonder is a reference to Puritan scientist and witch-hunter Cotton Mather's 1693 book Wonders of the Invisible World, which Rennie found intriguing because of what she called its \\"madness brimming under the surface of things.\\" Discography =Albums= *Odessa (1994) Carrot Top Records / Scout Releases *Milk and Scissors (1996) Carrot Top Records / Scout Releases *Invisible Hands (1997) Carrot Top Records / Scout Releases (Vinyl only EP release) *Through the Trees (1998) Carrot Top Records / Loose *In the Air (2000) Carrot Top Records / Loose *Twilight (2001) Carrot Top Records / Loose *Singing Bones (2003) Carrot Top Records / Loose *Last Days of Wonder (2006) Carrot Top Records / Loose *Honey Moon (2009) Carrot Top Records / Loose *Wilderness (2013) Carrot Top Records / Loose *Unseen (2016) Milk & Scissors Music / Loose ;Compilations and Live albums: *Down in the Valley (1999) Independent Records (Ireland only release) *Live at Schuba's Tavern (2002) Digital Club Network *Smothered and Covered (2002) Handsome Family Music *Scattered (2010) Handsome Family Music * \\"Tower of Song\\" - Too Late to Pray: Defiant Chicago Roots (2019) Bloodshot Records =Singles= *\\"My Beautiful Bride\\" b/w \\"Destroy, Destroy\\" (1999) Magwheel (7\\" split w/ Sackville) *\\"Drunk by Noon\\" b/w \\"The Blizzard\\" (2008) Carrot Top Records *\\"Far from Any Road\\" (2015) References External links *Official website *2009 The Handsome Family Interview at Bandega.com *the Handsome Family article May 2009 *Article *Glorious Noise: interview *Interview *WTF Pod with Marc Maron podcast episode interview American alternative country groups Musical groups established in 1993 Musical groups from Chicago Mint Records artists 1993 establishments in Illinois Musical groups from New Mexico Loose Music artists ","title":"The Handsome Family"},{"id":"20666671","text":"Papaq√ßƒ±lar is a village and municipality in the Tovuz Rayon of Azerbaijan.

The song \\"Thamizha Thamizha\\" is a poem written by Subramanya Bharathi. \\"Chinna Chinna Aasai\\" was the first song Rahman had composed for the film. The song \\"Kadhal Rojave\\" has two versions in both Tamil and Hindi; a solo and a duet in the former. The Hindi version of the song was titled \\"Roja Jaaneman\\" has two versions - one by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and the other by Hariharan. Released on Lahari Music, it was also listed in Time magazine's \\"10 Best Soundtracks\\" of all time. It also fetched the National Film Award for Best Music Direction for A. R. Rahman and the National Film Award for Best Lyrics for Vairamuthu. The Tamil and Hindi versions of the album sold over million units in India, with the Tamil version selling over 200,000 units and the Hindi version selling 2.8million units. The Hindi version of the album earned in sales. Background Mani Ratnam after his long relationship with Ilaiyaraaja, decided to collaborate with a newcomer. He happened to listen to some ad jingles, composed by Rahman, in an awards function, where Rahman received the award for Best Jingle Composer. Impressed with Rahman's works, Ratnam visited his studio and listened to a tune that Rahman had composed long back on the Kaveri River water dispute (later revealed to be \\"Tamizha Tamizha\\" from the soundtrack). Ratnam signed him immediately for his next project, Roja, which was the first one in his terrorism trilogy. Rahman, in spite of his reluctance to seriously take up work in films, accepted the offer since Ratnam had the reputation of a director with a good taste for music. Rahman would later say: \\"I wasn't sure myself why I accepted Roja. I was offered Rs 25,000 for it, a sum that I could make in three days composing ad jingles. I think it was the prospect of working with Mani that enticed me\\". In an August 2016 interview with Filmfare, Rahman recalled that he chose not to pursue education at Berklee College of Music because he got to work on Roja.http://www.filmfare.com/features/exclusive-interview-ar-rahman-talks- about-music-movies-and-family-14831.html Development Rahman used instruments and grand arrangements to generate an expansive sound. Songs such as \\"Rukkumani\\" had a loud thumping feel and became ingrained in pop culture. The score was performed at the Panchathan Record Inn in Chennai. The song \\"Thamizha Thamizha\\" is a poem written by Subramanya Bharathi. \\"Chinna Chinna Aasai\\" was the first song Rahman had composed for the film.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/Thirukkural-explained- life-centuries-ago-Kalam/articleshow/45057883.cms For the lyrics of song, Vairamuthu revealed that the song took two and half hours to write and he wrote 120 desires in the song but later shortened it into 16 and also revealed that he used the lines of a song which was originally composed for Doordarshan.http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp- tamilnadu/musical-medley-with-trivia-on-songs/article195190.ece The song \\"Kadhal Rojave\\" is set in the Kapi raga.http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/notes-that- intrigue/article4174187.ece Regarding the music Mani Ratnam says, \\"I was trying to do a film, I wanted good music and I was searching for somebody who would and I heard a demonstration tape of his which he had sent across. I thought that in the first note of the piece that he had sent me was really brilliant, really outstanding piece. So I went across to his studio and he played me some more, lots of things which he had done for jingles and a few other musical pieces he has done for somebody else. They were quite amazing and I had no doubts that he would be right for my film. How much he would grow, I was not looking at. I was looking at predominately my film at that point of time. He was ready to break a lot of conventions that were there in terms of music at that point of time, in terms of recording at that point in time. So I was very lucky to find someone who was willing to break away and do something different.\\" For the Hindi version of the soundtrack, Alka Yagnik and Kumar Sanu were offered to sing the songs, but both declined as they did not know about Rahman at that time. Release history The soundtrack album was originally released in Tamil by Lahari Music in 1992. The soundtrack was later released in Malayalam and Telugu in 1993 and in Hindi and Marathi in 1994 by Magnasound. The instrumental special version featuring five songs was released in Tamil and Telugu by Lahari Music in 1993 and in Hindi by Magnasound in 1994. Reception and influence A. R. Rahman receiving a Platinum sales disc at the MagnaSound Awards for Roja Rahman introduced new orchestral melodies in Indian film soundtracks, which till then was based on a few traditional Indian instruments. Time magazine's noted film critic, Richard Corliss stated in 2005 that the \\"astonishing debut work parades Rahman's gift for alchemizing outside influences until they are totally Tamil, totally Rahman,\\" naming it one of the magazine's \\"10 Best Soundtracks\\" of all time. Recalling the massive success of his first film, Rahman says, \\"I was lucky to set a sound in the first film. And I had the right people like Mani Ratnam guiding me to achieve it also and by the grace of god it set and the people know from the moment the song is heard that this is Rahman's.\\" Through Roja several singers got their breakthrough in the Tamil music scene as well. Sujatha Mohan, Unni Menon and Minmini, who is only known as the singer of \\"Chinna Chinna Aasai\\", probably her best known song in her entire career, were noticed following their performances in Roja, while noted ghazal singer Hariharan made his Tamil debut through this album. Rahman even had musically untrained elderly women sing. Awards A. R. Rahman won the National Film Award for Best Music Direction, the first time ever by a debutant. Rahman also earned Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Music Director and Filmfare Best Music Director Award (Tamil) for his work. Vairamuthu won the National Film Award for Best Lyrics for \\"Chinna Chinna Aasai\\", while Minmini won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Female Playback for the same song.

Penn. L. Rev. 1474 (1975) which treated the development of one of baseball's most- misunderstood rules as if it were a legal matter. Early life and education Stevens was born in Orange, New Jersey and grew up in Millburn Township. He attended Yale University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1970. He served for two years as an officer in the United States Navy and was awarded a law degree in 1975 from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.Grimes, William. \\"William S. Stevens, 60, Dies; Wrote Infield Fly Note\\", The New York Times, December 11, 2008. Accessed 9 May 2017 Infield Fly Rule The Infield Fly Rule (now covered by Major League Baseball rules 6.05e and 2.00), was adopted in the 1890s to prevent situations in which fielders could take advantage of base runners by intentionally allowing a ball to drop with runners on first and second or bases loaded and less than two outs in order to turn a double play or triple play on the base runners. In such circumstances, the Infield Fly Rule is invoked at the umpire's discretion if a fair fly ball can be caught by an infielder \\"with ordinary effort\\", and the batter is automatically out.Rule 6.01 to 6.02, Major League Baseball. Accessed December 12, 2008.Official Rules: 2.00 Definition of Terms, Major League Baseball. Accessed December 18, 2008. The rule was first implemented in the short-lived Players' League in 1890 and adopted by the National League and American Association of Base Ball Clubs in 1894, applying only if a fly ball could be handled by an infielder with a runner on first base occupied and only one out, with additional changes made in subsequent years.Evolution of 19th Century Baseball Rules, 19th Century Baseball. Accessed December 18, 2008. Stevens was fascinated by the incremental development of the rule and the way in which the rule's formal, step-by-step development mirrored the process by which the common law was created. The semi-parodic paper was thoroughly footnoted to show how the rule was needed in an era in which unseemly behavior was taking place that would not have been accepted in the sport's earlier gentlemanly age. In addition to its sometimes-humorous commentaries on baseball, the article is a parody of the style in which law review articles are generally written, such as their sometimes overly-formal wording and their often excessive use of footnoting. The very first word of the article, \\"The\\", is supported by an unnecessary citation to the Oxford English Dictionary. The second time the word \\"the\\" appears, another footnote appears (footnote 4), which merely refers back to the first footnote. A more complex example of parody appears when the text refers to a late-19th-century baseball player who was said to have \\"the speed of an ice wagon,\\" followed by a footnote stating: \\"Raised by this statement is the issue of the speed of an ice wagon in both relative and absolute terms. Such inquiry is beyond the scope of this Aside.\\" Soon after it was published, a slew of imitators were written, including Further Aside: A Comment on 'The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule',John J.

Career Stevens worked for a number of law firms in the Philadelphia area and became assistant director of the American Law Institute and of the American Bar Association's Continuing Legal Education program. After retiring in September 2008, he accepted a one-year assignment as the acting director of the continuing education program of the Alaska Bar Association. Stevens wrote numerous articles during his legal career, including work for The Philadelphia Lawyer, but none achieved the renown of his Infield Fly Rule note.

He went on to Oregon State University, where he earned a master's degree in 1938. He then returned to Willamette to teach for one year. In 1939, he continued his graduate work at Pennsylvania State University under the mentorship of Frank C. Whitmore, a renowned organic chemist. In 1942, Mosher completed his PhD in organic chemistry. He remained at Pennsylvania State as an assistant professor, supervising research on synthetic anti- malarial drugs for the National Research Council and the production of DDT with the War Production Board. In 1944, Mosher married Carol Walker, a fellow chemistry graduate student at the university. Three years later, Mosher accepted an assistant professorship at Stanford University in the Department of Chemistry, and he and his wife moved to California for the position. That same year his wife Carol joined the staff of the Stanford Research Institute, later becoming senior organic chemist.  Research contributions  While at Stanford, Mosher taught organic chemistry and conducted research in natural products chemistry and stereochemistry. He and his graduate student Melanchton Brown identified a deadly toxin produced by the California newt living in Stanford's Lake Lagunita, calling it tarichatoxin. They soon discovered that it was the same toxin produced by the puffer fish, used in a rare type of sushi that if prepared incorrectly could paralyze and kill human diners. Mosher determined the structure of the toxin, which is known as tetrodotoxin. Mosher worked on many other natural products including both plant pigments and toxic substances. Mosher also invented the \\"Mosher reagent\\" or Mosher's acid, which is used to measure the degree of left- or right-handedness in organic molecules.  Awards and honors  Mosher received an honorary doctoral degree from Willamette University. Harry Mosher served as chair of the California section of the American Chemical Society in 1955 and on the ACS National Council, both elected positions. In 1978, Mosher received the Abraham Ottenberg Service Award from the ACS. Two years later, the ACS established the Harry and Carol Mosher Award to advance the field of chemistry.  Later life  Mosher retired from Stanford in 1981. He spent his later life engaged in tennis and skiing, and lunched regularly with his friends at the Rathskeller in the Stanford Faculty Club. He died in 2001, and was survived by his wife, their three children, and five grandchildren.

The episode was written by co-executive producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and supervising producer Paul Zbyszewski and directed by \\"Hearts and Minds\\" director Rod Holcomb. In 2007, Desmond Hume searches for a woman who could help the survivors stuck on the island stop the island's shifts. On the island, John Locke, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford and Juliet Burke try to save Daniel Faraday, Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume from the Others. Plot The episode opens with a flashback of Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), in the Philippines, searching for a doctor to help his wife Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), who is giving birth to their son, Charlie. In 2007, Desmond and Penny arrive in London, where Desmond plans to look for the mother of Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), who is believed to be at Oxford University. However, the university has no record of either Faraday, even though Daniel was a professor there. Desmond breaks into and searches Faraday's lab. He meets a janitor who tells him that Faraday conducted experiments on a woman and provides an address for her. At her house, Desmond finds that the woman is in a vegetative state after experiencing temporal disassociation, similar to Desmond's experiences on the freighter (as seen in \\"The Constant\\"). He learns that Penny's father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), is not only paying her medical expenses, but also funded Daniel's research. Desmond confronts Widmore, who gives him the address of Daniel's mother in Los Angeles. Desmond returns to Penny, who agrees that they must travel to Los Angeles. In 1954, following the events of the previous episode, \\"The Lie\\", Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) interrogate the two men they have captured. Juliet deduces that they are members of the Others because they can speak Latin. One of the men, who is revealed to be a young Charles Widmore (Tom Connolly), kills the other when he agrees to lead them to Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) and flees to his campsite to warn his people. Locke follows him and meets with Alpert, using Jacob's name and the compass Alpert gave him to gain his trust; however, Alpert is not entirely convinced. Locke tells Alpert to visit him after he is born in 1956 (a visit depicted in the episode \\"Cabin Fever\\", during which Alpert shows a young Locke the compass). Locke attempts to convince Alpert to show him how to leave the island, but runs out of time as the next time shift jump occurs. At the same time, the freighter team, consisting of Miles Straume (Ken Leung), Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), and Daniel Faraday, are captured by another group of Others, led by Ellie (Alexandra Krosney). Faraday deduces that the American military has come to the island to test hydrogen bombs, and that the Others are in possession of one. When he convinces Alpert to let him defuse the bomb, Alpert counters and asked Faraday to prove that he is not on a suicide mission to detonate the bomb. Faraday then confesses his love for Charlotte as proof that he will not detonate the bomb on purpose. Ellie leads Faraday to the bomb (the titular Jughead), and after an inspection, he discovers that it is leaking radiation. Faraday immediately advises Ellie that the bomb should be buried and will not go off for at least 50 years, inadvertently revealing that he is from the future. Ellie doesn't believe him, but Juliet and Sawyer shows up and disarm her. The time shift jump occurs once again and the group is safe, but Charlotte suddenly collapses with a nosebleed.

I firmly believe that Desmond wants to keep Penny safe, and that any choices he makes to the contrary are made with great reluctance, and only because he‚Äôs answering to a higher calling. Desmond can talk about duty and time travel and be credible in a way most other Lost characters never can.

At the island, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford and John Locke devise a plan which might possibly stop the time flashes, but encounter hostiles; while Jin- Soo Kwon, revealed to be alive, meets the younger Danielle Rousseau in the past. Plot The episode opens with a flashback of Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) on Penny Widmore's (Sonya Walger) boat, following their rescue in early January 2005. Kate convinces Jack that once returning home that they should claim that Aaron (William Blanchette) is Kate's biological son, while in fact his mother is Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin). =On the Mainland= In late 2007, Kate leaves Aaron in the care of Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) in order to confront attorney Dan Norton (Tom Irwin), who is pursuing a maternity test for Kate and Aaron. Sun receives a package with a gun and pictures of Ben and Jack. Norton tells Kate that he is going to meet his client later and Kate decides to follow him. Meanwhile, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) meets up with Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) at the hospital. An orderly armed with a tranquilizer gun attacks Sayid, but Sayid overcomes him, and when he finds Kate's address in his wallet he, Ben and Jack, suspect Kate is the next target.

This makes no sense to several of the group since Charlotte, who has the worst symptoms, has only been on the island for a few days. The latest time jump has brought the group to November 1, 2004, the day of Aaron's birth, an event that Sawyer witnesses, and the death of Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder).

The film was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Score, Best Sound (Charles L. Lootens), and Best Art Direction (John Victor Mackay). The film marked the first serious attempt by Republic Pictures to break out from its traditional production of B movies and produce a work of greater cost and prestige.Hurst p.14 The film is a biopic of the politician Sam Houston, focusing on his relationship with Andrew Jackson and his role during the Texas Revolution. It was inspired by Marquis James's 1929 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Houston. Plot Sam Houston fights beside his friend Andrew Jackson and is wounded. Not long thereafter, Jackson is elected President of the United States and appoints Houston as governor of Tennessee. Houston is married to Eliza Allen, but his lifestyle as a politician does not appeal to her. Their divorce is somewhat scandalous for the time, and Houston decides to accept Jackson's suggestion that he become ambassador to the Cherokee tribe instead. On a trip to Washington, DC, to put forth his argument how the Indians are being mistreated in their own land, Houston falls in love with Margaret Lea at a presidential ball. She returns with him to Texas, where the next mission for Houston is to free the territory from the rule of Mexico, either by diplomacy or on the battlefield. Stephen F. Austin disagrees with Houston's methods, preferring peaceful negotiations, but when the army of Santa Ana heads toward The Alamo in tremendous numbers, Houston knows no peaceful settlement is possible. He arrives too late to prevent the carnage there, but then leads the Texans in their fight for freedom and statehood.

It is characterized by a wealth derived from both land and sea products. Conquests or demographic movement towards the Algerian territory were two of the main factors of exchanges between the different peoples and cultures (Berbers, Arabs, Turks, Andalusians, French and Spaniards). This cuisine is a Mediterranean and North African cuisine with Berber roots. Algerian cuisine offers a variety of dishes depending on the region and the season, but vegetables and cereals remain at its core. Most of the Algerian dishes are centered around bread, meats (lamb, beef or poultry), olive oil, vegetables and fresh herbs. Vegetables are often used for salads, soups, tajines, couscous and sauce-based dishes. Of all the Algerian traditional dishes available, the most famous one is couscous, recognized as a national dish. Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Algeria, in accordance with Sharia, the Islamic law. Ingredients Algeria, like other Maghreb countries, produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables and even some tropical ones.\\"Food in Algeria\\". Food in Every Country (website).

Algeria has four well-known traditional soups consumed throughout the country: chorba, harira, djari and tchicha. These traditional Algerian soups are served at the beginning of the meal as an entree and are mainly prepared from lamb, mutton or chicken, chickpeas, tomatoes, vermicelli, wheat, spices and different vegetables and legumes. These varied soups are the most popular during the holy month of Ramadan. There are many different types of Algerian salads, including both raw and cooked vegetables, served either hot or cold. Hot salads include zaalouka, an aubergine and tomato mixture, and chakchouka, a mixture of tomatoes, smoked green peppers, garlic , eggs and spices. Influenced by both the Algerian and Mediterranean cuisines, chakchouka may include beetroot or anchovies. There are also dishes of Spanish origin in Algeria, like the Gaspacho Oranais, an Algerian version of a Manchego dish. Rogag Algerians commonly use tajines, a earthenware pot, to cook.

Algerians are heavy coffee consumers; thick espresso and black coffee are very popular. Fruit juice and soft drinks, called gazouz, are common and often drunk daily. Algeria previously produced a large quantity of wine during the French colonization but production has decreased since its independence; however, there are some secular activists that want to produce wine. Bread Between 1976 and 1984, the average Algerian family spent around 56% of their income on food and drink, and more than 10% of that number was spent on bread and other cereal products.

Baguette =Algerian bread= French bread tends to be given more value in terms of taste and quality in that it was commonly associated to being more suitable to higher standards. However, the white inner parts of a baguette are thought to be unhealthy and will regularly be thrown away, and the bread is frequently associated with constipation. Algerian breads, on the other hand, are considered more nutritive, rich and tasteful and seldom go to waste. Because French breads harden over night or become chewy when put away in plastic bags, it is hard to find usage for them, so they are thrown away with more frequency than Algerian breads that can be reheated or reutilized as edible food utensils or even bird feed. In the context of rituals, only Algerian bread is thought suitable. Breads offered to guests should be homemade, as it signifies the essence, intimacy, and qualities of the family. In daily practices, it is also a sign of wealth and affluence if one has extra bread at the table, and making bread at home can be considered a sign of familial economic independence.

Ever since its early days Hunslet has been the 'Workshop of Leeds'. Although from the Industrial Revolution onwards there have been other areas in Leeds to have a large industrial base, such as Holbeck, Armley, Kirkstall and Harehills, none so much as Hunslet. Like neighbouring Holbeck, Hunslet benefited from its close proximity with the River Aire, Leeds city centre, coal mining communities to the south, extensive railways and some of Leeds' best infrastructure. From the 1960s onwards the motorways would also drive industry and commerce in Hunslet. Hunslet grew from an unremarkable area at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to a major industrial area only a few years later. The growing industries in Hunslet were not the textile industries, for which Leeds was becoming best known, but generally heavier industries such as steel and iron foundries, engine works and railway works.  1906  By 1906, Hunslet was home to Leeds‚Äô second largest gas works, the city's main rail goods yards, known at the time as ‚ÄòMidland Goods Station‚Äô (now the site of Crown Point Retail Park), as well as a large number of factories, below is a rough inventory of the major industrial premises in Hunslet at the time.South Leeds, 1906, Ordnance Survey, * Joshua Tetley and Son's Brewery - South Brook Street/ Crown Point Lane * Sun Foundry - Dewsbury Road * Potterdale Mill - Dewsbury Road * Well House Foundry - Dewsbury Road * Oil Works - Dewsbury Road * Malthouse and Maltkiln- Dewsbury Road * Railway Works - Butterley Street * Printing Works - Butterley Street * Union Mills - Holmes Street * Leeds Corporation Refuse Destructor - Kidacre Street * Malthouse - Gold Street * Stafford Pottery (disused) - Leathley Road * Crown Point Printing Works - Hunslet Road * Boyne Engine Works - Jack Lane * Hunslet Engine Works - Jack Lane/Cancel Street * Steam Plough and Locomotive Works - Hunslet Road/ Leathley Road * Airedale Foundry (Iron and Steel) - Hunslet Road/ Grape Street/ Pearson Street * Railway Foundry (Iron) - Jack Lane * Midland Engine Works - Jack Lane * St Helen's Mills - Whitehouse Street * Brush Works - Glasshouse Street * Larchfield Engineering Works - Hunslet Road * Larchfield Woollen Mills - Pym Street * Hunslet Glass Works - South Accommodation Road * Goodman Street Works (Iron and Steel) - Goodman Street * Lock Works - South Accommodation Road * Aire Bank Mills - South Accommodation Road * Airedale Chemical Manure Works - Clarence Road * Dolphin Foundry (Iron) - Sayner Road * Hunslet Nail Works - Atkinson Street * Victoria Mills - Goodman Street * Hunslet Linen Works - Goodman Street * Nevin's Foundry - Goodman Street * Malthouse - Larchfield Road * Progress Works (Mineral Water) - Stafford Street * Albert Tool Works - Donisthorpe Street * Yorkshire Steel Foundry - Black Bull Street * Victoria Chemical Works - Clarence Road * Providence Works - Cudbear Street * Saw Mills - Cudbear Street * Iron Works - Crown Point Road * Union Foundry (Iron) - Brookefield Street * Airedale Works - Albury Road * Globe Mills (Cabinet Works) - Chadwick Street * New Dock Wagon Works - Black Bull Street * Bowman Lane Dye Works - Crown Point Road * Leather Works - Hunslet Lane Hunslet was home to Leeds' second largest gasworks, the site had a large column guided gasholder, which was replaced in the 1960s by two spiral guided gasholders (which still stand). The site no longer produces town gas, storing natural gas instead.  1960s  Hunslet Grange (Leek Street) flats In 1968, a widespread slum clearance project led to the construction of the Hunslet Grange Flats, also informally known as the Leek Street Flats. The 2,500 flats were commissioned by Leeds City Council and constructed by Shepherd Building Group. The flats were built as a large complex, sprawling over much of Hunslet. While the flats enjoyed a degree of popularity in their first few years, this did not last, the layout of the complex and severe condensation lead to them being attributed to many health and social problems in the area, and only 13 years after construction began, in 1983, the council began to demolish the complex. The 1960s also saw the M1 motorway come to Hunslet, since the rerouting of the M1 around the East of Leeds taking it to the A1(M) motorway at Aberford, the Hunslet stretch of the former M1 is now part of the M621.  1980s  Following the demolition of Hunslet Grange, the area was again redeveloped with low rise council housing in the early 1990s.  2000s  The 2000s saw the redevelopment of the former industrial area surrounding Clarence Dock.

It was the successor of the Face Recognition Vendor Test. Overview The primary goal of the FRGC was to promote and advance face recognition technology designed to support existing face recognition efforts in the U.S. Government. FRGC developed new face recognition techniques and prototype systems while increasing performance by an order of magnitude. The FRGC was open to face recognition researchers and developers in companies, academia, and research institutions. FRGC ran from May 2004 to March 2006. The FRGC consisted of progressively difficult challenge problems. Each challenge problem consisted of a data set of facial images and a defined set of experiments. One of the impediments to developing improved face recognition is the lack of data. The FRGC challenge problems include sufficient data to overcome this impediment. The set of defined experiments assists researchers and developers in making progress on meeting the new performance goals. There are three main contenders for improving face recognition algorithms: high resolution images, three-dimensional (3D) face recognition, and new preprocessing techniques. The FRGC is simultaneously pursuing and will assess the merit of all three techniques. Current face recognition systems are designed to work on relatively small still facial images. The traditional method for measuring the size of a face is the number of pixels between the centers of the eyes. In current images there are 40 to 60 pixels between the centers of the eyes (10,000 to 20,000 pixels on the face). In the FRGC, high resolution images consist of facial images with 250 pixels between the centers of the eyes on average. The FRGC will facilitate the development of new algorithms that take advantage of the additional information inherent in high resolution images. Three-dimensional (3D) face recognition algorithms identify faces from the 3D shape of a person's face. In current face recognition systems, changes in lighting (illumination) and pose of the face reduce performance. Because the shape of faces is not affected by changes in lighting or pose, 3D face recognition has the potential to improve performance under these conditions. In the last couple years there have been advances in computer graphics and computer vision on modeling lighting and pose changes in facial imagery. These advances have led to the development of new computer algorithms that can automatically correct for lighting and pose changes in facial imagery. These new algorithms work by preprocessing a facial image to correct for lighting and pose prior to being processed through a face recognition system. The preprocessing portion of the FRGC will measure the impact of new preprocessing algorithms on recognition performance. The FRGC improved the capabilities of automatic face recognition systems through experimentation with clearly stated goals and challenge problems. Researchers and developers can develop new algorithms and systems that meet the FRGC goals. The development of the new algorithms and systems is facilitated by the FRGC challenge problems. Structure of the Face Recognition Grand Challenge The FRGC is structured around challenge problems that are designed to challenge researchers to meet the FRGC performance goal. There are three aspects of the FRGC that will be new to the face recognition community. The first aspect is the size of the FRGC in terms of data. The FRGC data set contains 50,000 recordings. The second aspect is the complexity of the FRGC. Previous face recognition data sets have been restricted to still images. The FRGC will consist of three modes: * high resolution still images * 3D images * multi-images of a person. The third new aspect is the infrastructure. The infrastructure for FRGC will be provided by the Biometric Experimentation Environment (BEE), an XML based framework for describing and documenting computational experiments. The BEE will allow the description and distribution of experiments in a common format, recording of the raw results of an experiment in a common format, analysis and presentation of the raw results in a common format, and documentation of the experiment format in a common format. This is the first time that a computational-experimental environment has supported a challenge problem in face recognition or biometrics. The FRGC Data Set The FRGC data distribution consists of three parts. The first is the FRGC data set. The second part is the FRGC BEE. The BEE distribution includes all the data sets for performing and scoring the six experiments. The third part is a set of baseline algorithms for experiments 1 through 4. With all three components, it is possible to run experiments 1 through 4, from processing the raw images to producing Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs). The data for FRGC consists of 50,000 recordings divided into training and validation partitions. The training partition is designed for training algorithms and the validation partition is for assessing performance of an approach in a laboratory setting. The validation partition consists of data from 4,003 subject sessions. A subject session is the set of all images of a person taken each time a person's biometric data is collected and consists of four controlled still images, two uncontrolled still images, and one three- dimensional image. The controlled images were taken in a studio setting, are full frontal facial images taken under two lighting conditions and with two facial expressions (smiling and neutral). The uncontrolled images were taken in varying illumination conditions; e.g., hallways, atriums, or outside. Each set of uncontrolled images contains two expressions, smiling and neutral. The 3D image was taken under controlled illumination conditions. The 3D images consist of both a range and a texture image. The 3D images were acquired by a Minolta Vivid 900/910 series sensor. The FRGC distribution consists of six experiments. In experiment 1, the gallery consists of a single controlled still image of a person and each probe consists of a single controlled still image. Experiment 1 is the control experiment. Experiment 2 studies the effect of using multiple still images of a person on performance. In experiment 2, each biometric sample consists of the four controlled images of a person taken in a subject session. For example, the gallery is composed of four images of each person where all the images are taken in the same subject session. Likewise, a probe now consists of four images of a person. Experiment 3 measures the performance of 3D face recognition. In experiment 3, the gallery and probe set consist of 3D images of a person. Experiment 4 measures recognition performance from uncontrolled images. In experiment 4, the gallery consists of a single controlled still image, and the probe set consists of a single uncontrolled still image. Experiments 5 and 6 examine comparing 3D and 2D images. In both experiments, the gallery consists of 3D images. In experiment 5, the probe set consists of a single controlled still. In experiment 6, the probe set consists of a single uncontrolled still.

Other dioceses have also made use of it to a greater or lesser extent, including Diocese of Plymouth, Portsmouth, East Anglia, Clifton, Menevia, the Archdiocese of Cardiff and the newly founded Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. While it served mainly the dioceses of the South of England, it also provided formation for students from dioceses further afield and for members of religious institutes. From 1985 it offered courses in theology for lay (external) students. These courses ran alongside the academic programme offered to students in formation. This programme was validated by St Mary's University, Twickenham, of which the seminary was an Associated Institution. The Seminary was also a resource for local Church activities, and provided a venue for various groups including the formation programme for the Permanent Diaconate, as well as a centre of expertise in the work of formation and sacred science. The seminary occupied a building listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England.  History  =Foundation= St John's Seminary was established in 1891 as the diocesan seminary for the then Diocese of Southwark\\"New Rector for St John's Seminary, Wonersh\\", Independent Catholic News, 5 February 2016 by Bishop John Baptist Butt. He desired to found a college along entirely different, continental, lines, in distinction to the more Jesuit-inspired tradition of the English seminaries to date. He employed as his first rector the young priest Francis Bourne, later to become Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, who had studied at the great seminary of St Sulpice in Paris and had also known St John Bosco. The project began almost immediately; a site was purchased at Lostiford, a hamlet outside the village of Wonersh near Guildford, and during the two years that the seminary was under construction, the community began in Henfield Place, a large house (still standing) in Henfield, Sussex. Butt was determined that his foundation be entirely new. Therefore, those men already studying for the Southwark Diocese were left in their current seminaries, and only new entrants were taken for the new St John's Seminary, some boys as young as twelve. These were to complete their studies in the humanities at St John's before proceeding to the study of Philosophy and Theology at about the age of 17 or 18. In September 1891, the buildings at Wonersh were sufficiently complete for them to house the new community, though the chapel was not to follow until 1896. In 1893 there were enough young men ready to begin studies in Philosophy and Theology, and so from this period St John's housed both a minor and a major seminary. =Early days= In 1896, Francis Bourne was made Coadjutor Bishop of Southwark only a few weeks after his 35th birthday, and not long afterwards succeeded to the see when Bishop John Baptist Butt retired. As Rector of Wonersh Bourne was succeeded by George Barrett. However, the latter suffered from ill-health and resigned in 1901, to be succeeded by the nephew of the founder, and later Auxiliary Bishop in Westminster, Joseph Butt. This was a turbulent time for the Seminary, as for the Church. Modernism had begun to appear, and received a certain amount of support from some of the lecturers and students. Bourne, while bishop, was inclined to be mildly tolerant of this, but his successor, Peter Amigo, was not. Amigo had succeeded in 1903, when Bourne was unexpectedly appointed Archbishop of Westminster. Amigo removed several of the lecturers inclined towards Modernism, and his instinct in this was later confirmed by Pope St Pius X's encyclicals Pascendi and Lamentabili, which condemned Modernism in no uncertain terms. Joseph Butt left Wonersh in 1907, to be succeeded as rector by Arthur Doubleday, later Bishop of Brentwood. Bourne had wanted Thomas Hooley, the 'regent' (or superior of the junior seminarians) as Butt's successor, and the resulting disagreement between Bourne and Amigo lead to a permanent cooling of relations between the two. Amigo was well aware of his canonical authority over Wonersh, which was the seminary of his diocese, and that Bourne, despite his personal history, had no formal role in its regard. As for Doubleday, he proved to be endowed with a strong character, which he drew upon to steer the seminary through the difficulties of the First World War. This was a period when many of the junior seminarians were called up after 1916, some being sent to the front. As a consequence, the seminary slowly emptied, with only those seminarians remaining who as regards military service were too old, too young or in some way incapacitated. =Mid 20th century= After the war, the seminary recovered well. In 1924, it was becoming so full that the decision was made to establish a new junior seminary, which became St Joseph's College, Mark Cross near Crowborough in Sussex, making St John's exclusively a major seminary, which it has remained ever since. In the same year, Monsignor Philip Hallett became rector, the longest serving and arguably one of the most successful in the seminary's history. The Second World War was not so devastating for Wonersh as the First. No students were called up, but were able instead to 'do their bit' locally, participating in various civil defence operations, including operating a local fire service. Following the war, the entry of large numbers of demobbed servicemen into the seminary gave rise inevitably to disciplinary problems, which were resolved in the 1950s by the stern government of Mgr Bernard Wall, later to be Bishop of Brentwood. =Post- conciliar= Though St John's had always been considered the strictest of the English seminaries, the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council brought considerable relaxation, with a less cloistered life and more direct pastoral experiences for seminarians during their studies. On an academic front, arrangements with English universities were developed, first Southampton, then Surrey, and then St Mary's Twickenham. These enabled the seminarians to qualify for a secular academic degree. St John's accepted students from several dioceses in England and Wales and from Scotland. Changed circumstances, especially a continued decline in the numbers of those seeking to study for the priesthood, meant that the future of Wonersh was subject to periodical review after the turn of the millennium, especially after the closure of the seminary of St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw. =Closure= This ongoing process of review led to the decision to close St John's at the end of the academic year in 2021. This decision was announced in October 2020, after the intake for the beginning of that academic year had dropped to zero. Of the seventeen students already in residence, six were due to complete their studies in July 2021 and it was envisaged that the other eleven would be transferred to Allen Hall Seminary in London. No firm indications as to the future of the complex were given in the press release announcing the closure.

The region is located in the westernmost part of the Province of Le√≥n and occupies one-third of that province. The inhabitants of this region have a marked personality and idiosyncrasy favored by the geographical situation of El Bierzo, a tectonic pit consisting of several valleys of different size, each separated from similar neighboring regions by a series of mountainous mountain ranges that surround it. These groups and persons want to restore the Provincia del Vierzo, which disappeared in the 1833 territorial division of Spain. The comarca of El Bierzo is the only one in Castile and Le√≥n recognized by that region's Statute of Autonomy, and it has its own regional legislature, the Consejo Comarcal de el Bierzo (Regional Council of El Bierzo). Advocates of a Province of El Bierzo wish also to annex the territories of Valdeorras (currently in the Province of Ourense), plus (from within the province of Le√≥n) Laciana and the part of La Cabrera that formed a part of the extinct province but is not in the ambit of the present regional council According to a 2006 survey on this topic, more than 53 percent of Bercianos would support the restoration of the province.Survey realized by the Spanish National University of Distance Education  References  El Bierzo ","title":"Provincia de El Bierzo"},{"id":"20667422","text":"150px The Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) was a series of large scale independent evaluations for face recognition systems realized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2000, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2013 and 2017. Previous evaluations in the series were the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) evaluations in 1994, 1995 and 1996. The project is now in an Ongoing status with periodic reports, and continues to grow in scope. It now includes tests for Face-in-Video-Evaluation (FIVE), facial morphing detection, and testing for demographic effects (e.g., age, gender, and race).  Face Recognition Vendor Test 2006  The primary goal of the FRVT 2006 was to measure progress of prototype systems/algorithms and commercial face recognition systems since FRVT 2002. FRVT 2006 evaluated performance on: *High resolution still imagery (5 to 6 mega-pixels) *3D facial scans *Multi-sample still facial imagery *Pre-processing algorithms that compensate for pose and illumination To guarantee an accurate assessment, the FRVT 2006 measured performance with sequestered data (data not previously seen by the researchers or developers). A standard dataset and test methodology was employed so that all participants were evenly evaluated. The government provided both the test data and the test environment to participants. The test environment was called the Biometric Experimentation Environment (BEE). The BEE was the FRVT 2006 infrastructure. It allowed the experimenter to focus on the experiment by simplifying test data management, experiment configuration, and the processing of results. The FRVT 2006 was sponsored by multiple U.S. Government agencies and was conducted and managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). One of the goals of the FRVT 2006 was to independently determine if the objectives of the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) were achieved. The FRGC was a separate algorithm development project designed to promote and advance face recognition technology that supports existing face recognition efforts in the U.S. Government. One of the objectives of the FRGC was to develop face recognition algorithms capable of performance an order of magnitude better than FRVT 2002. The FRGC was conducted from May 2004 through March 2006. FRGC data is still available to face recognition researchers. To obtain FRGC data, potential participants must sign the required licenses and follow FRGC data release rules. To request a FRGC data set, please follow directions found on the \\"FRGC Webpage.\\" FRVT 2006 Protocol FRVT 2006 Protocol FRVT 2006 Executable Calling Signatures FRVT 2006 Executable Naming Convention FRVT 2006 Results The FRVT 2006 large-scale results are available in the combined FRVT 2006 and ICE 2006 Large-Scale Results evaluation report. It assesses algorithms based on input from 22 organizations in 10 different countries, with many submitting multiple algorithms. However, only those who successfully completed the large-scale tests are documented in this report. The report shows how error rates for the best algorithms have improved by orders of magnitude over the years, from a False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0.79 at a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.001 in 1993, to a FRR=0.01 for FAR=0.001 in 2006. Part of this improvement is due to higher quality face images. The best results from 2006 were for \\"very high-resolution still images\\" (6 Mp) and 3D images.FRVT 2006 and ICE 2006 Large-Scale Results, March 2007, Figure 1 on p. 5, chapter 3 regarding image quality  Face Recognition Prize Challenge 2017  The Face Recognition Prize Challenge (FRPC) assessed face recognition algorithms on photographs collected without tight quality constraints, e.g. images collected from individuals who are not cooperating or do not know they are photographed. Prized were awarded both for verification and identification. The best verification algorithm had a false non-match rate FNMR of 0.22 at a false match rate FMR of 0.001. Prized were also awarded for speed and for verification against a set of cooperative portrait photos.  Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) Ongoing  FRVT Ongoing now has roughly 200 face recognition algorithms and tests against at least six collections of photographs with multiple photographs of more than 8 million people. The best algorithms for 1:1 verification gives False Non Match Rates of 0.0003 at False Match Rates of 0.0001 on high quality visa images.FRVT 1:1 Verification, as of 25 March 2000] Additional Programs: * FRVT: DEMOGRAPHIC EFFECTS - effects of demographic differences (e.g., age, gender, race) on algorithm performance. * FRVT MORPH - detection of facial morphing, especially as it pertains to photo- credential issuance. * FACE Challenges - recognition of individuals from photographs posted on social media. * Face in Video Evaluation (FIVE) - ability of algorithms to identify or ignore persons from video sources, many times in which the person is not actively cooperating for the purposes of facial recognition, i.e. \\"in the wild\\".

It was established in 1985 by Jami Masjid and Islamic Centre Birmingham.http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/morning-news- headlines-tributes-continue-11485685 Controversies =2011= The school was inspected in May 2011, following a Channel 4 documentary Dispatches filming teaching sessions within the school. Ofsted found that it was \\"good\\" with regards to the behaviour of pupils, \\"satisfactory\\" with regards to how well the curriculum and other activities met the range of needs and interests of pupils and quality of provision for pupils‚Äô spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, but \\"inadequate\\" in overall quality of education, how effective teaching and assessment were in meeting of pupils‚Äô needs, how well pupils made progress in their learning, and the overall welfare, health and safety of pupils. The report followed the Dispatches documentary, entitled Lessons in Hate and Violence, on February 14, 2011, which filmed undercover inside the school, documenting that many students and teachers were preaching intolerance to other students. Some of the footage showed a preacher making extremely offensive remarks about Hindus and ranting: \\"Disbelievers are the worst creatures\\". The school released an official statement about the programme on its website, stating that it had been grossly misrepresented and that comments had been taken out of context.https://web.archive.org/web/20110824071315/http://www.darululoom.org.uk/ Local MP John Hemming made comments supporting the school. The school said it was targeted by hate calls following the broadcast. The DfE ruled that the Dispatches programme found a \\"substantial amount of evidence\\" of intolerance and contempt for other cultures, religions and mainstream society and \\"a culture of intolerance where adherents to other faiths are despised and considered inferior\\". It said that the school promoted a \\"wholesale repudiation of mainstream society\\"; and that the headmaster, deputy headmaster, and religious studies teacher were among the speakers secretly recorded \\"denigrating or belittling members of other religions\\" and promoting the view that Muslims must remain separate from mainstream society. In one lesson, a teacher \\"appears to be advocating war against America and/or Jews, and to be repudiating democracy\\"; children were taught to refer to non-Muslims using terms \\"used on extreme websites such as those operated by Al Qaeda\\". The headmaster had given lessons \\"condemning all non-Muslims and all aspects of their behaviour\\", as well as promoting Islamic punishments, including the chopping of hands for stealing and stoning for adultery, with no reference to a British context, which \\"may not be enabling pupils to distinguish right from wrong ... and to respect British law. The DfE said the \\"combined effect of these speeches is to emphasise to the pupils that they should not have any contact with people who belong to other religious groups; indeed contact should be hateful... and to discourage them from living in harmony with members of British society\\". It also said that a separate Ofsted inspection in the wake of the programme had found \\"serious regulatory failings\\". The DfE strongly backed the editing of the Dispatches programme. It said: \\"There was no other teaching that DfE saw that presented other religions, cultures or cultural traditions in a positive light. There was no evidence in the footage that was viewed to support the school's contention that its teachings were likely to prepare students to integrate, interact with and contribute beneficially to wider society. The school has written back to the DfE with an action plan, promising \\"a significant transformation of the school structure\\". The school said the headmaster had been replaced by an acting head, and all teachers identified in the film as making \\"inappropriate comments\\" had been dismissed. One was imprisoned. The governing body had also been disbanded and all members of its Senior Management Team had been dismissed. It said it was taking a number of other steps to combat extremism and improve community cohesion. The DfE has accepted the action plan, but warned that the school may still be struck off the register for independent schools if it did not adhere to regulatory standards. =2015= In 2015 the school was subject to another critical Ofsted report, this time after further expressions of concern which led to an unannounced inspection. It was found that a female governor sat in a different room to male governors when conducting a governance meeting. The school responded saying it was the female governor's choice to sit apart, and that segregation was not routinely practiced at the school.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34921582 References External links * Independent schools in Birmingham, West Midlands Islamic schools in England Islam in Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"Darul Uloom, Birmingham"},{"id":"20667454","text":"The Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE) were a series of events conducted and managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for projects on technology development and evaluation for iris recognition.

Hogg reorganized the railroad as the Willamette Valley & Coast Railroad, and ground was first broken in Corvallis on May 17, 1877. The Oregon Pacific Railroad was organized on September 15, 1880, as a successor to the WV&C.; Hogg originally intended to terminate the line at Seal Rock on the Oregon Coast. In anticipation of the railroad's arrival, the town was platted in 1877 with pedestrian-friendly public spaces and resort hotels that would accommodate train travelers, but the line was instead routed through Toledo to end at Yaquina, resulting in financial ruin for many who invested in Seal Rock. To the east, the line extended as far as Idanha, short of Santiam Pass before running out of money. Hogg purchased the steamship Yaquina City to provide a direct link to his railroad between Yaquina and San Francisco. Yaquina City successfully completed several voyages, until she ran aground at Yaquina Bay in 1887 due to a rudder failure. Despite the Yaquina City being insured, Hogg had just lost his biggest source of income and could not immediately replace the steamer. Hogg's contract with the government stated however, that if he could establish railroad service over the Cascade Mountains, he could receive a massive land grant. By selling this land, enough money could be made to keep the railroad in business. To get the grant, some additional track was laid over Santiam Pass. Hogg had mules pull some cars a few times to assert right of way. Hogg Rock near Santiam Pass is named for T. Egenton Hogg for his railroad which went around the rock. Track was also laid in the canyon of the Malheur River to reserve that pass for the railroad. Yaquina Bay (ex-Caracas) aground on the south jetty of Yaquina Bay. In 1888, Hogg purchased the Ocean liner Caracas from the Red D Line to replace the Yaquina City. She was renamed Yaquina Bay and towed to Yaquina. Before steamship service could restart however, Yaquina Bay broke free the tugboat which was hauling her on December 9, 1888, and ran aground near the wreck of the Yaquina City. Like the Yaquina City, the Yaquina Bay was declared a total loss. The railroad entered bankruptcy in October 1890. In 1894 it was sold to A.B. Hammond and renamed the Oregon Central and Eastern Railway, and again in 1897 was reorganized as the Corvallis and Eastern Railroad. In 1907 the C&E; was sold to the Southern Pacific. Some of the tracks were submerged by Detroit Lake in the 1950s when the Detroit Dam was completed. In 1999, the line's corridor from Idanha to the Cascade summit was designated as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was founded at the beginning of the 20th century by a mystic Muhammad ben Amadu (d. 1909) of Maure and Fulani background, as reform movement of Tijaniyyah practice. Stressing opposition to hierarchy and downplaying the importance of education, the movement spread in the 1920s by Amadu's disciple Shaykh Hamahullah bin Muhammad bin Umar (1886‚Äì1943) in what was then French Soudan, modern Mali. It first took root amongst Wolof traders living in Nioro, but soon spread to servile caste Muslims in Mauretania and Mali. Doctrine Hammallist doctrinal changes from Tijaniyyah ritual included the removal of some recited references to the Prophet, rejecting Qur'anic study, and the shouting of prayers in group worship. Hammallists tended to stress traditional West African ritual and the rejection of traditional hierarchies, including gender, age, and caste distinctions.John R. Hinnells (ed). A New Dictionary of Religions. (1995) Opposition and growth Opposed to what it saw as the hierarchy of the then dominant Tijaniyyah order, Hamallism grew into a social protest movement, especially from poor or slave communities and opposed both the wealthy among African and the colonial government of French West Africa. From the 1920s to the 1940s, periodic flareups of Hamallist attributed protest and violence occurred in what is today Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, C√¥te d'Ivoire, and Niger, and were suppressed by both the French authorities, and local Tijaniyyah leaders. Among the prominent converts to Hamallism were Tierno Bokar Salif Tall, grand nephew of the precolonial military and political leader of the Tijaniyya Jihad state El-Hadj Umar Tall, in Mali;Louis Brenner. \\"The Sufi Teaching of Tierno Bokar Salif Tall\\".

Playing career =College= In 1936, Tim Cohane, Fordham University's publicist, discovered a newspaper clipping from 1930 paying tribute to Fordham's linemen by calling them the Seven Blocks of Granite. Cohane revived the nickname for the Rams' 1936 and 1937 lines, and it was this second version that gained the greatest renown. Druze, who was known as \\"Tarzan\\", was the right end. He was captain of the 1937 team and was also its placekicker. The 1936 Rams finished 5-1-2 and lost a possible Rose Bowl bid when they were upset by New York University at Yankee Stadium, 7-6, in the season's final game. \\"That was always a blood game\\", Druze told Newsday in 1986, referring to the rivalry. \\"Forget about the records. It was like Purdue and Notre Dame.\\" Fordham's 1936 team shut out three opponents and gave up only 33 points. The 1937 Rams were 7-0-1 and held five opponents scoreless. Druze's best-known teammate on the Seven Blocks of Granite was Vince Lombardi, the Pro Football Hall of Fame coach of the Green Bay Packers, who played right guard. But Alex Wojciechowicz, the All-American center and later a Hall of Fame player with the Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles, was the star of the Fordham line. The other linemen were right tackle Al Babartsky, who later shortened his name to Bart, and was, by his recollection, the biggest block at 6 foot 1 and 220 pounds; left guard Nat Pierce; left tackle Ed Franco; and left end Leo Paquin. The Seven Blocks of Granite were stars on the sports pages, and they certainly earned their acclaim. But the players were treated the same as all Fordham students. As Druze recalled a half-century later, \\"You hit the books, you're back on the field and you hit the books again.\\" =NFL= Druze was an 11th round (93rd overall) of the 1938 NFL Draft by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He played only that following season in the National Football League. Coaching career =Boston College= Druze became an assistant to Frank Leahy at Boston College in 1939. Leahy had coached the Seven Blocks of Granite as an aide to Fordham's head coach, Jim Crowley, one of Notre Dame's Four Horsemen. =Notre Dame= When Leahy became the Notre Dame head coach in 1941, Druze joined him as an assistant, and he became a mentor to Leon Hart, an end who won the 1949 Heisman Trophy. =Marquette= Druze was the 18th head football coach at Marquette University located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He held that position for three seasons, from 1956 until 1958.College Football Reference Marquette University Football Records His coaching record at Marquette was 2 wins, 26 losses, and 1 tie.

Such committee has been formed every four years since the 1901 inauguration of William McKinley. The members are sitting U.S. Senators and Representatives. Typically, the House members include the Speaker of the House as well as the House majority and minority leaders. The Senate members are drawn from the leadership of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration (previously known by other names). A senator acts as chair, and is therefore drawn from the majority party of the Senate.

It became extinct in the 1850s.BirdLife International 2003 BirdLife's online World Bird Database: the site for bird conservation. Version 2.0. Cambridge, UK: BirdLife International. Available: http://www.birdlife.org (accessed 12 December 2008) Description Illustration from the 1800s The Lord Howe pigeon was mostly brown, with a purple head and breast, and a white patch on its throat. Ecology The bird was found in an arboreal habitat, particularly closed forests. Spread throughout the lowlands of Lord Howe Island, it is likely the species fed upon fruits and seeds. Records Lord Howe Island was discovered in 1788. A written report was made Arthur Bowes, who landed on the island when the Lady Penrhyn stopped there in 1788. Parties from his ship collected many birds from the island, including many Lord Howe pigeons, which they subsequently ate. The tameness of the birds made hunting particularly easy. Lady Penrhyn had been travelling with the Charlotte, and her Captain, Thomas Gilbert, wrote that he captured five or six dozen of the birds, almost all that he found. By breaking the legs of the birds and leaving them to cry, others were drawn to investigate, allowing his near complete capture. In 1790, midshipman George Raper of produced a painting of the bird. Raper had never personally travelled to Lord Howe Island, but may have seen specimens of the pigeon caught there and taken about the Sirius or another ship. Few reports of the bird's existence were made before its extinction. As no skins or specimens of the bird were ever obtained, Raper's painting, and a second painting, provide the only concrete evidence of the bird's existence. Dr Foulis, who was a resident of the island from 1844 until 1847, recorded the bird as being the only bird of value on the island. At this time the island's population was only 16 humans, but the Lord Howe pigeon was soon extinct. The species was driven to extinction in the mid-19th century. Hunting by humans is believed to be the likely cause of extinction. The last recorded sighting of the bird took place in 1853. No specimens were collected before extinction. The species was described by Gregory Mathews in 1915, using Raper's painting as a guide. At the time, he named it Raperia godmanae for Alice Mary Godman. It was eventually reclassified as a subspecies of Columba vitiensis.

The modern church rests on the site of two earlier churches. Religious affiliation The church is maintained and overseen by the Benedictine Order. History =First Byzantine church (4th century)= The first church, built alongside the important road that passes by, was erected around AD 350. =Second Byzantine church (5th century)= The church was significantly enlarged around the year 480, with floor mosaics also added at this time. These renovations are attributed to the Patriarch Martyrius of Jerusalem. In AD 614 Persians destroyed the Byzantine church. =19th-20th-century rediscovery= After the AD 614 destruction, the exact site of the shrine was lost for some 1,300 years. In 1888 the site was acquired by the German Catholic Society for Palestine (Pal√§stina-Verein der Katholiken Deutschlands) which was associated with the Archdiocese of Cologne. An initial archaeological survey was conducted in 1892, with full excavations beginning in 1932. These excavations resulted in the discovery of mosaic floors from the 5th-century church, which was also found to be built on the foundations of a much smaller 4th-century chapel. =20th-century reconstruction= Since 1939 the property has been administered by the Benedictine order as a daughter-house of the Dormition Abbey in Jerusalem. The ground was bought in 1888 by the German Catholic Palestine Mission, archeological research started in 1892. In the 1930s a provisional protective structure was erected above the holy rock and the Byzantine mosaics. The current church, inaugurated in 1984, was built to the same floor plan as the 5th-century Byzantine church, some of the ancient black basalt walls have survived and remain visible. The Cologne-based architects Anton Goergen and Fritz designed a simple, modest building in a somewhat neo- Byzantine style. The windows are fitted with alabaster panels. The bright limestone stones were brought from a quarry near Taybeh (between Jericho and Ramallah), the red bricks from Italy and the roof timbering from Germany.Markus Krastl: Tabgha als Memorialst√§tte der Speisung der F√ºnftausend.

While the adjacent office and storage building was burnt down to its walls, the church itself did not suffer damage.

[ONLINE] Available at: http://www.timesofisrael.com/arson-suspected-in-fire-at-church-on-sea-of- galilee/. ‚ÄúWhatever repairs are not covered by insurance must be paid for by the Israeli government‚Äù, said Wadie Abunassar, media spokesman for the Assembly of Catholic Ordinaries of the Holy Land. ‚ÄúWe believe this attack was tantamount to a terror attack, and when there is a terror attack the state is responsible for paying for compensation and prosecutes the perpetrators.‚Äù The Jewish Week, 20 July 2015 In late July 2015, four Israeli Jews age 18 to 24 and an unnamed minor were arrested by the Israel police and indicted for the arson. The suspects are reportedly associated with the Jewish extremist, ultra-nationalist \\"Hilltop Youth\\". The media coverage at the time of the arson largely distorted the fact that the church building itself had been unharmed. In February 2017, new media reports suggested that the church itself had been closed for nearly two years as a result for the arson attack, although it was open throughout the time. Interior =Layout= The interior of the church has a central nave and two aisles. The sanctuary is backed by an apse with transepts on either side. Under the altar is a block of limestone found during excavation, that is venerated as the stone on which the miraculous meal was laid. =Mosaics= One of the main highlights of the church are its restored 5th-century mosaics. These are the earliest known examples of figurative floor mosaics in Christian art in the Holy Land. The mosaics in the two transepts depict various wetland birds and plants, with a prominent place given to the lotus flower. This flower, which is not indigenous to the area, suggests the artist's use of a Nilotic landscape popular in Roman and Early Byzantine art. All the other motifs depict plants and animals from the Galilee. The mosaic found in front of the altar depicts two fish flanking a basket containing four loaves of bread. =Fourth- and fifth-century remains= Also preserved in the modern church are the sill of the left entrance to the atrium, basalt paving stones, and part of the apse frieze. The foundations of the original 4th- century church can also be seen under a glass panel to the right of the altar. Outside the atrium A basalt-made oil press is displayed in the courtyard, as is a baptismal font outside of it.

Walter needs the money desperately for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that he is infatuated with a local woman and he feels as though he has nothing to offer to her. He accepts the offer only to find out that the task of killing another human being is much more difficult than he thought, especially when it turns out that his intended victim is not really a child killer.

Administratively they belong to the town of Paldiski. For centuries the islands had been inhabited by Estonian Swedes, until during the Second World War the entire population was forced to leave. Etymology The Swedish name of the islands R√•g√∂arna means Rye Islands - historically rye was the primary crop grown on the island. Thus Stora R√•g√∂ and Lilla R√•g√∂ mean Big Rye Island and Small Rye Island, respectively. Alternative names for the two islands are V√§stra R√•g√∂/V√§ster√∂ and √ñstra R√•g√∂/√ñster√∂ (West Island and East Island). In terms of area V√§ike-Pakri (Lesser Pakri) is actually somewhat larger than Suur-Pakri (Greater Pakri). The reason for this contradiction is probably that Suur-Pakri had more inhabitants and better farming lands and was reckoned as more important. Geography An aerial photo of the Pakri Islands and the Pakri Peninsula. Northern coast of V√§ike-Pakri. The islands lie a few kilometers off the Estonian coast. V√§ike-Pakri lies 3 km west of Paldiski, separated from it by Paldiski (Pakri) Bay (), over 20 m deep. The shallow 3 km wide Kurkse strait separates the islands from the mainland in south. The area of V√§ike-Pakri, the eastern island, is 12.9 km2, Suur-Pakri covers 11.6 km2 (8th and 9th largest islands in Estonia). V√§ike-Pakri is also higher than Suur-Pakri (17 m and 8 m, respectively). Both islands are about 6 km long (in southeast-northwest direction) and 2-2.5 km wide. A few islets are situated in the 1-1.5 km wide and shallow (2‚Äì4 m deep) strait between the two islands. In 1952, an embankment connecting the two islands over some of the islets was built by the Soviet army. A limestone cliff borders the northern coast of both islands and also the eastern coast of V√§ike-Pakri. Part of the Baltic Klint, it rises up to 4 m on Suur-Pakri and up to 13 m on V√§ike-Pakri. Both islands are essentially part of a larger limestone plateau in Northern Estonia. =Villages= Storbyn on V√§ike-Pakri in the 1930s. Before the Second World War the two islands had 5 villages, three on Suur-Pakri and two on V√§ike- Pakri. Suur-Pakri *Storbyn () (100 inhabitants in 1935) *Strandbyn or √Ösbyn () (59) *Bisagidbyn () (38) V√§ike-Pakri *Storbyn () (88) *Lillbyn () (72) History Remains from the time when islands were used as a site for aerial bombardment by Soviet forces. When the people started to live in the islands, is unknown. In 1345, five Swedish families bought the western island from Padise monastery. According to the 1934 Estonian census, the islands had 354 inhabitants, all of them Swedes except for 13 Germans. There were 5 villages, a total of 119 households, a small folk museum (opened in 1935, closed in 1940) and both islands had their own church and school. Following the signing of Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the subsequent action of the Soviet Union (see Soviet ultimatums in 1939), in 1940 all the islanders were forced to leave - the islands were designated as a military base for the Soviet Army. Most of Pakri Swedes left for Sweden before 1944, during the German occupation of Estonia. After the Second World War V√§ike-Pakri had a few inhabitants until 1965. During the Soviet Era, until 1992, the islands were used as a proving ground for aerial bombardment by Warsaw Pact countries. After control of the islands was returned to Estonia in 1994, the main aim became to clear the area of unexploded bombs. Thousands of explosive devices were destroyed and the work was mostly completed by 1997. During the land reform following the restoration of independence in Estonia some of the land was returned to its pre-war owners. The northern parts of the islands and the southern part of V√§ike-Pakri were incorporated to Pakri Landscape Conservation Area, created in 1998 to protect the limestone cliffs, alvars and rare species. In 2004, the islands got their first permanent inhabitant over decades, when a person born there during the Second World War returned to rebuild his parents' farm. At the end of 2009 the islands had 6 permanent inhabitants.

Seven, eight, nine, ten and more strings have been used by guitarists seeking to increase the range of pitches available from the instrument. Some of these guitars are ethnic instruments, specific to different cultures such as Russian and Brazilian guitars. During the 90's the seven string guitar became popular among metal bands such who used the additional string for extra low end. Extended range classical guitars (especially 8- and 10-string instruments) are being seen more frequently, and have found favor with guitarists who play Renaissance and Baroque lute music, as well as those who wish to transcribe piano and orchestral works for the guitar. There are some classical players of the seven-string guitar who also use an extended treble range by adding more frets at the high end (similar to some Viennese guitars of the 19th century.) This is a list of guitarists who have made notable usage of extended-range guitars or have played a specifically notable instrument.

Of all Watts' matches, the most notable was the final game at the Balmoral Showgrounds against Ireland. The game was an overly violent affair, after members of both packs ran into each other the night before the game. The Welsh pack, of which Watts was part off, was named the 'Terrible Eight' by newspapers after the game. Watts played one final game for his country, in an exhibition game against the Barbarians in 1915. Again led by Alban Davies, Watts turned out in the match played to boost recruitment for the Welsh Guards, though the game is not recognised as a full international.

Some important pathogenic serovars from this species are Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Australis. L. interrogans is difficult to culture, requiring special media and extended incubation periods. L. interrogans infects wild and domestic animals, including pet dogs. Humans are accidental hosts. It can survive in neutral or slightly alkaline water for 3 months or longer. L. interrogans is usually transmitted to humans through contact with infected animal urine, either directly or in water. It invades directly through broken skin and can replicate in the liver and kidneys. Risk factors for infection include working in sewers, farming, and recreational water activities. Infection is known as leptospirosis, which can be asymptomatic, a mild non-specific illness, or result in death from liver damage and kidney failure (Weil's syndrome).

EERI members include researchers, geologists, geotechnical engineers, educators, government officials, and building code regulators. Their mission, as stated in their 5-year plan published in 2006, has three points: \\"Advancing the science and practice of earthquake engineering; Improving understanding of the impact of earthquakes on the physical, social, economic, political, and cultural environment; and Advocating comprehensive and realistic measures for reducing the harmful effects of earthquakes\\".EERI, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute Strategic Plan 2006-2010, 2006. Goals In the 2006 5-year plan, the EERI has identified four main goals towards fulfilling their mission and planned strategies to carry them out. #\\"Enhance and expand educational materials and technical programs.\\" They will hold two seminars per year on topics intended to interest a wide audience. They will also post many of their publications online, such as their journal Earthquake Spectra. # \\"Outreach and Advocacy\\" They will continue to release their findings on earthquake risks, including the costs of potential disasters. They hope to influence policymakers to increase funds for preventing these risks. They hope also to include earthquake safety into the \\"green\\" building design movement. #\\"Maintain a strong program of international activities.\\" They serve as an inflow point in the U.S. for earthquake research from other countries. They also serve as an outflow, translating their research into languages other than English. #\\"Expand and broaden financial resource base.\\" They wish to raise $1 million in donations by 2010, and increase worldwide membership to 3,000. They wish to expand their programs and partnerships with other organizations with more workshops and seminars. In February, 2010, the EERI entered a partnership with the Geo-Institute of American Society of Civil Engineers, increasing their collaboration to reduce earthquake hazards. History The EERI was formed in 1948 as an advising committee on the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. It quickly became its own independent, nonprofit organization, with the purpose of studying why buildings fail under earthquake disasters, and what methods can prevent these failures. At first they conducted their research in laboratories of different University or Government groups. As the EERI grew, they began to more often send research funds to the Universities, and have the University conduct the research. EERI focused more on identifying and investigating areas in need of research, and policymaking based on the university's lab results. In 1952 the EERI organized the first Conference on Earthquake Engineering, at UCLA. In 1955, they held the first World Conference on Earthquake Engineering. In 1984, the 8th World Conference was held in San Francisco. This conference brought in scientists from 54 countries. At first, membership to the EERI was limited to invite-only engineers and scientists. In 1973, they began to hire members by application, and increased their membership from 126 to 721 by 1978. In 1991, EERI began receiving funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to continue publishing information on how to reduce damage from earthquakes. After a number of location changes, the EERI headquarters settled in Oakland, California. Their quarterly journal, Earthquake Spectra, covers current research on earthquake engineering and is available online or by subscription. Its target audience is any geologist, seismologist, or related engineer. EERI also publishes many other types of information, including a monthly newsletter, an oral history series, and field investigation reports. California earthquake assessments EERI performs risk assessments on earthquake potential sites around the world. This is a quick summary of two reports on California cities. In 2006 an engineering firm related to the EERI has projected over $122 billion in damages, if a repeat of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurs. This number includes damages to homes and structures, excluding fire damage.Johnson, Alex. \\"Bay Area far from ready for the next ‚ÄòBig One‚Äô.\\" The EERI lobbies for government funding to prevent natural disasters. The money is best spent before loss of life and large-scale structural damage, though often it is not seen until afterward, as evidenced by Hurricane Katrina. The EERI and the USGS have identified that a potential large earthquake in Los Angeles would cause more damage than Katrina at New Orleans, with up to $250 billion in total damages and 18,000 deaths. Student involvement EERI has a student chapter in 29 colleges across the U.S. to further promote interest in earthquake engineering. A few representatives from each chapter make up the Student Leadership Council (SLC). Since 2008 the EERI and SLC have held the Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition, which was previously run by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER). In this competition a team of undergraduate college students must design and construct a structure made of balsa wood. The structure is limited by many rules, such as a weight limit, the individual heights of each floor, total height limit, and more. The structure is subjected to extra weight and placed on a shake table, which moves to simulate an earthquake. An accelerometer is placed on top of the building to measure how fast the top of the building shakes. Students‚Äô structures are judged on a number of criteria, including the height of the structure, number of floors, the accelerometer readings, and whether the structure breaks. Students will want to make a building close to the height limit because the higher floors are worth more points. The 8th annual competition is to be held in Portland, OR, March 7 through 10, along with the 63rd EERI annual meeting.

Built in 1676 and used continuously since then by the Quaker community for worship, it is one of the oldest purpose-built Friends meeting houses in the world. It is classified by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building, a status given to buildings of \\"exceptional interest\\" and national importance. An adjoining 15th-century cottage is listed separately at Grade II*, and a mounting block in front of the buildings also has a separate listing at Grade II. Together, these structures represent three of the 100 listed buildings and structures in Crawley. History The Ifield area has a long history of Protestant Nonconformism and Dissent. As early as 1655, George Fox‚Äîone of the founders of the Religious Society of Friends‚Äîand a Quaker preacher, Alexander Parker, held meetings and preached at a private house in the village. Meetings became more regular in the next two decades, but were still held in parishioners' houses. There were strong feelings both in favour of and against the growing Quaker community: the vicar of St Margaret's Church (the parish church) between 1667 and 1679, Henry Halliwell, was strongly opposed to Nonconformism and preached and wrote against it, whereas a protest in the church in 1658 by a parishioner sympathetic to Quaker beliefs was allowed to continue without interruption. William Penn lived nearby before leaving England for America and founding Pennsylvania; he had links with the local Quaker community and the meeting house in their early days, and clashed with Henry Halliwell. In response to Penn's 1673 treatise entitled Wisdom Justified of her Children from Calumny of Henry Halliwell, Halliwell wrote a piece called Impertinent Cavils of William Penn. By 1676, 27% of adults in the parish of Ifield, which covered of mostly rural land in north Sussex, described themselves as Nonconformist. Some would have been Presbyterians, Unitarians or Baptists, for example, but most were Quakers. Meetings for Quaker women in the parish were started the previous year. In 1676, land and money bequeathed by a local blacksmith, Robert Robinson, was used to build a dedicated, purpose-built meeting house for the community. It has been continuously used for worship since then, and is one of the oldest Friends meeting houses still in existence anywhere in the world. =Restoration= Survey of a window frame before restoration work began The Meeting House and Cottage were restored during 2010 and 2011. HMDW Architects surveyed the buildings and managed the project, and Alfred Cox & Sons (Brighton) carried out the work.Ifield Quakers website, with more details of the project This included replacing decayed timber lintels and cills, removing rotting timber bearers, repointing the masonry, carrying out timber repairs to the original window frames, and installing new amenities to improve accessibility and hospitality.'Ifield Meeting House Restored' The Quaker Magazine. Retrieved 18.08.2010. Meeting house elevation: note the repointing. The meeting house is on the right and 5 Langley Lane is on the left. The meeting house has ashlar walls made of local sandstone. The roof slates are also made of a local material‚ÄîHorsham stone. The frontage has two bays with half-hipped gable roofs. The entrance doorway is centrally placed between the bays and still has its original rustication at the quoins, although the door itself is modern. The lintel of the doorway has \\"1676\\" carved into it, and some of the quoin blocks also have 17th-century dates and initials. There is another (off- centre) doorway on the rear face of the building. This has one window at ground-floor level, whereas the frontage has one in each bay with wooden mullions and transoms. There are smaller windows at first-floor level. Extensions and additions have been made since the 17th century. Many of the internal fittings are made of pine and were installed in the 18th century. A burial ground was also added. By 1851 the capacity was 162, although use of the meeting house had declined from a peak of nearly 100 worshippers earlier in the century. The meeting house was given a Grade I listing by English Heritage on 21 June 1948. It is one of three buildings with that designation in the Borough of Crawley; the others are St Margaret's Church and St Nicholas' Church at Worth. 5 Langley Lane The cottage now known as the Meeting House Cottage, at 5 Langley Lane, is two centuries older than the meeting house itself. It is a two-storey timber-framed cottage built in the late 15th century. Robert Robinson owned it and the adjacent land in the late 17th century; he passed the cottage, his blacksmith workshop and all the surrounding land to the local Quaker community in 1674. As a result, the meeting house was built on to its eastern side. A red-brick facing was applied to the south face in the 18th century, and the west side is partly brick-faced and partly tiled. The roof is also tiled, and held up inside by crown posts. English Heritage classified the cottage, which is still used by the warden of the meeting house, as a Grade II* listed structure on 23 February 1983. Mounting block The mounting block A mounting block is a slab or set of steps which enables a horse rider to mount or dismount a horse. An 18th- century example stands on the forecourt outside the meeting house. The main structure is brick, but the three steps have stone treads. There is a space inside for storage. The top of the block is spanned by a stone lintel. The structure is recognised separately by English Heritage, which listed it at Grade II on 23 February 1983.

Ornelas, an animal rights advocate for more than 20 years, is the founder of the Food Empowerment Project. Background and education Ornelas was born in San Antonio, Texas and grew up in Texas, where she became a vegetarian as a child. She attended Douglas MacArthur High School in San Antonio from 1984 to 1988. When in high school, she became a vegan and started her first animal rights group. Ornelas studied at St. Edward's University in Austin from 1990-1993, majoring in communications and minoring in political science. In 1992, she founded the St. Edwards Animals Rights Society, which transitioned into Action for Animals after she graduated. While in college, nuns tore down her \\"Go Veggie\\" posters. In the 1992-93 academic year, Ornelas was a recipient of the St. Edward's University Presidential Award. Ornelas received her Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Edward's. She continued her work for animals while attending university and eventually became the National Coordinator for In Defense of Animals. Career Ornelas in 2008 Ornelas worked for In Defense of Animals from 1995 to 1999. Viva! UK then asked Ornelas to start and run Viva! USA, a national nonprofit vegan advocacy organization, where she did numerous factory farm investigations. Ornelas ran Viva!USA from February 1999 to April 2006. As Viva! USA‚Äôs executive director, in cooperation with activists across the country, she also brought corporate changes to such powerful companies as Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe's, and Pier 1 Imports. In 2003, Ornelas appeared at the annual shareholder meeting of Whole Foods Market and spoke about the treatment and the lives of the ducks that were killed to be sold in Whole Foods stores. Whole Foods CEO John Mackey was present and initially responded to Ornelas's speech dismissively. But a subsequent sequence of e-mails between Ornelas and Mackey, plus Mackey's reading of a dozen books on animal agriculture, resulted in Mackey becoming vegan (from vegetarian). In a 2004 address to the Empty Cages Conference, Ornelas described the results of Viva!USA's campaign to get grocery stores to stop selling duck meat: > \\"Grocery store chains, Earth Fare, Huckleberries, our local co-ops and Wild > Oats either stopped buying duck meat from the farms we investigated or duck > meat altogether. In fact, Trader Joe's stopped carrying all duck meat and > put a statement on their website testifying to the fact that this was done > because their customers were concerned about the treatment of the animals. > With Trader Joe's the goal of our campaign was achieved.\\" In 2006, Ornelas‚Äô desire to address a variety of social justice issues came to fruition with the opportunity to give a talk ‚ÄúCorporate Animal Farms: Exploiting Animals, Workers and the Environment, and Why You Should Work to Stop It‚Äù at the World Social Forum in Caracas, Venezuela. It was in Caracas that she noted that many of the issues being discussed revolved around food, from labor and immigration issues to water, animals, and the environment. Ornelas knew that being more responsible about what we eat was key to fighting injustice, and her idea for the Food Empowerment Project (F.E.P.) was born. Ornelas is the founder and executive director of F.E.P., a non-profit organization. Ornelas campaigns against chocolate produced by labor of West African slaves. \\"How can we say vegan chocolate is cruelty-free just because it doesn't contain animal products? If it comes from the blood and sweat of slaves in West Africa -- children, no less -- it's certainly not cruelty- free,\\" she says. Ornelas was one of several people who provided information used in the writing of the book Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism (2008) by Mark Hawthorne. She later married Hawthorne; they live in northern California. Ornelas wrote a chapter of Lisa Kemmerer's 2011 anthology Sister Species: Women, Animals, and Social Justice. Foreword by Carol J.

In the beginning, the club started with about ten 11- to 13-year-old children training once a week, learning basic ball control skills. Over the next 6 years though, the club has expanded hugely and now boasts a sizeable youth team and a large senior men's team. The club has operated out of numerous venues in the southside of Edinburgh. In the beginning, the local leisure centre at Gracemount was used but as the club expanded there was a need for more regular training sessions and better facilities. Since 2005, GEHC have been training at highschools at Liberton and Gracemount, both with new sports facilities available. From 2006 onwards, GEHC has seen a large influx of foreign students joining the team while studying in Edinburgh. These students, mainly from mainland Europe have had previous experience with Handball as it is a professional sport on the continent. Due to this, the less experienced Scottish players have been learning from a vast pool of experience and improving rapidly. Early years For the first 3 years of Gracemount's existence, the club was solely focused on Youth development. Over the course of those 3 years, Gracemount took teams to the Partille Cup in Sweden. Results became gradually better over the years, but due to the scale of the sport in other countries, Gracemount lost most of their games to strong European teams. Despite this, the experience was extremely valuable as the young players were introduced to different styles of play and were able to witness handball played by experienced teams. In 2004, many of the older Gracemount players were selected to represent the Scotland U-16 squad, and played games against England, Ireland and a German regional team. The Gracemount players in the squad were very influential in the Scotland U-16 squad's victory over Ireland in the Liverpool Tri-Nations Tournament. 2005 ‚Äì present Since 2005, Gracemount have been competing in the Scottish Senior Men's League. At first, Gracemount's youth players made up much of the team and played against Men's teams like Tryst 77 and Glasgow. Over the last 2 years though, Gracemount has seen a large influx of older players which has allowed the club to expand rapidly. 2007/08 proved to be a promising season for the club, with the high point being a very credible performance against Great Dane HC, widely recognised as the best Handball Club in Britain. 2008 has seen the club expand even more, with 25-30 men training regularly. This allowed Gracemount to enter 2 teams into the Scottish league, with 1 team focused on mounting a title challenge while the 2nd team worked on development for the younger or less experienced players. This proved to be a success for Gracemount. The first team missed out on the Pre-Xmas title with a 29-28 loss to Glasgow HC. A win by 1 goal would have secured the title for Gracemount, but finishing second in the league ahead of defending champions Tryst 77 HC is still considered the club's greatest achievement to date. Gracemount's second team in the league also put in some promising performances, showing very clearly that they were not at all far behind the other teams in the league. The season 2009/10 became the season where the club achieved its goal of winning the Scottish Senior Men's League by winning 11 of 12 games and drawing one game 32-32 to Glasgow HC. The final game against Cumbernauld HC saw a fairly amputated Gracemount team, that due to the Icelandic Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcanic eruption, had some players stuck in their native countries. However, the team managed to win 41-38 against Cumbernauld HC. The next goal is to win the Scottish Cup 2009/10. World Class Handball Program Over recent years, the British Handball Association have been sending British handball players to Denmark to train with the World Class Handball Program in preparation for the London 2012 Olympics. Many Scottish players are involved in this process, including 1 Gracemount player, Taylor Hoven. Alan Stokes spent 3 years training in Denmark and playing for Danish club Braband in preparation for 2012. Taylor Hoven is part of the 2016 Olympic Program.

He formerly worked as a lawyer and civil servant from 1965 to 1982 and was the first secretary-general of the Norwegian Humanist Association from 1980 to 1982. He later made his mark as a writer and activist for peace and against nuclear arms. He is the honorary president, and former president, of the Norwegian Peace Council, a former vice president of the International Peace Bureau, and a former vice president of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms. Career Born in Rena, Heffermehl enrolled at the University of Oslo, graduating with the cand.jur. degree in 1964. He then worked as a lawyer from 1965 to 1973, while also taking a master's degree in 1970 at New York University. In 1973 Heffermehl became an assistant director at the office of the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman. He left this position in 1980 to become the first secretary-general of the Norwegian Humanist Association. He left the Humanist Association in 1982 to work as an independent writer. In addition to writing non-fiction books, Heffermehl has translated several books to Norwegian. In 1988 he became the president of the NGO Norwegian Peace Council, and a member of the board of the International Peace Bureau. In 1994 he became vice president in the International Peace Bureau, and in 1997 he assumed the same position in the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms. After stepping down as president of the Norwegian Peace Council, he was proclaimed honorary president. =Support of Mordechai Vanunu= Heffermehl is an outspoken supporter of Mordechai Vanunu, the technician who revealed the Israeli nuclear programme. Heffermehl said in 2008 that he had nominated Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize eighteen times. He has also tried to pressure the Norwegian government to grant political asylum to Vanunu on numerous occasions, citing that Norway has a special responsibility due to their 1959 delivery of heavy water to Israel via Great Britain. In April 2008 it was revealed that the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration had granted asylum to Vanunu in 2004, but the decision was overturned by then-Minister Erna Solberg. Upon the revelation Heffermehl expressed concern that although the political leadership of Norway changed in 2005, not nearly enough was done in the way of helping Vanunu, due to perceived loyalty concerns to the United States. Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr St√∏re, on the other hand, stated that Norway already had put enough pressure on Israel, through diplomatic channels. In May 2008 Heffermehl, this time together with prominent jurists such as Ketil Lund and Jan Fridthjof Bernt, again petitioned to Norwegian Prime Minister to take action. Nobel Peace Prize criticism Since August 2007 Heffermehl has marked himself as a staunch critic of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which, according to Heffermehl, has failed to comply with the will of Alfred Nobel, thereby making several awards--45% of the awards after 1945--juridically illegal. Among the laureates perceived by Heffermehl as illegal are the more controversial laureates, such as Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho (1973) and Arafat, Peres and Rabin (1994), but also less controversial ones such as Mother Teresa (1979) and Elie Wiesel (1986). Although many laureates have done \\"commendable work\\", Heffermehl stresses that this is not good enough to receive a prize whose criteria explicitly pertain to disarmament and peace work. His views were first explained in-depth in the 2008 book Nobels vilje (English: \\"Nobel's Will\\"). Since 1948, the selection of members of the Nobel Committee has been delegated from the Parliament of Norway (against what Nobel prescribed) to the major political parties. According to Heffermehl, the Norwegian political parties have used committee membership as an award to over-the-hill politicians in recognition of their service, rather than picking non-partisan people with an actual background in peace activism. Furthermore, Heffermehl, being an opponent of the Norwegian membership in NATO, finds that the broad pro-NATO consensus among Norwegian political parties has skewed the Nobel Peace Prize in a similar direction. This, says Heffermehl, runs contrary to Alfred Nobel's wishes to abandon military institutions. In an interview with Ny Tid he suggested that the current Committee members be replaced with people such as Jan Egeland, Ingrid Fiskaa, Jostein Gaarder and Sverre Lodgaard. Other suggestions from Heffermehl include Gunnar Garbo, Ingrid Eide, Erik Dammann, Torild Skard, Reiulf Steen, Johan Galtung and Berit √Ös. In Nobels vilje, Heffermehl regrets that Eide was not hired as Nobel Committee secretary when she actually applied for that position in 1990. =Criticism of Norwegian parliament distorting Nobel's intention= In the autumn of 2010 Heffermehl published a critical study, The Nobel Peace Prize. What Nobel really wanted. The aim was to look into the methods used by the Norwegian establishment to repress his rediscovery of the content of the prize for \\"the champions of peace\\" named in the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel.Heffermehl, Fredrik, The Nobel Peace Prize. What Nobel really wanted (Praeger 2010), , preface, p. xii Nobel made a choice between two fundamentally different ways forward for humanity, either continuing to seek peace by military means or by co-operation on international law, institutions, and disarmament.Heffermehl (2010), pp. 6, 39 When Parliament and the Nobel Committee ignored his views and declared that no one supported his interpretation,Committee secretary Lundestad, Aftenposten 6 April 2009 Heffermehl set out to prove them wrong. He found that numerous academic and other works over the years had expressed the same views on the role of Bertha von Suttner and that Nobel intended to support the antimilitarist peace movement.Heffermehl (2010) pp. 165-172 mentions a.o.: Ragnvald Moe (1932), Hertha Pauli (1942), Irwin Abrams (1962, 1972, 1992), Ursula Jorfald (1962), Birgit Brock-Utne (1985), Kenne Fant (1991), Gerd Gr√∏nvold Saue (1992), Peter van den Dungen (2005), Regina Braker (2005) This made it necessary to use the fate of the Peace Prize for a case study of the distortion of Nobel's testament and how Parliament had managed the prize entrusted to them by Nobel. \\"The Nobel Peace Prize\\" in English has been updated and expanded for editions in Chinese (FLP, Jan. 2011), Swedish (Leopard, Oct. 2011), Finnish (LIKE, Dec. 2011), Russian (Aletheia, in 2012).

AAAE was founded in 1928. AAAE's members represent nearly 875 airports and authorities, in addition to hundreds of companies and organizations that support airports. AAAE provides its members representation in Washington, D.C. training, meetings and conferences, and an accreditation program. History AAAE was founded in September 1928 when 10 airport directors met at the National Air Races at Mines Field in Los Angeles. Air races manager Cliff Henderson, acting on the suggestion of St. Paul, Minnesota's Francis J. Geng, sent letters to airport managers across the country to attend an organizational meeting with the goal of forming a group to represent airport management throughout the U.S. In 2013, Todd Hauptli was elected as the third full-time leader of the organization. During his tenure, Hauptli revamped the Interactive Employee Training product; created the Airport Innovation Accelerator. During Hauptli's tenure, the Association's revenues nearly tripled. Tory Richardson, A.A.E., CEO of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport, is AAAE's Chair for 2019-20. The association's membership elected Richardson and other members of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors during the 91st Annual AAAE Annual Conference in Boston, Massachusetts. Professional Development AAAE offers several accreditations and certifications, including; Accredited Airport Executive (A.A.E.); Certified Member (C.M.); Airport Certified Employee (ACE); Airport Security Coordinator Certification; and Airport Rescue Fire Fighter (ARFF). The program is open to Affiliate members of AAAE and IAAE. Until the early 2000s, the A.A.E. designation process required that the candidate have at least one year of experience in some aspect of airport management at a civilian public-use airport (military aviation experience was excluded) in order to commence the accreditation program. At that time, the three-step accreditation process consisted of a proctored, 180-question, multiple-choice closed book written examination; the research and writing of a postgraduate quality management research paper, regardless of whether or not the candidate held an advanced degree; and a final oral interview of three to four hours duration with a panel of no fewer than three A.A.E.s. In addition, the candidate had to have (1) accumulated no less than three years of cumulative experience in civilian airport management prior to designation as an A.A.E., and (2) completed the accreditation program in three (3) years or less from time of commencement or administrative penalties by AAAE would result.https://www.aviationpros.com/home/article/12326683/press-on-advice-for- todays-aae Today, candidates in the A.A.E. program obtain the designation by completing a streamlined three-step process - (1) a 180-question, multiple- choice examination; (2) a management research paper, case study, proctored essay examination, or proof of an advanced degree; and (3) a final interview with a panel of A.A.E.s. The three year time limit from program start to completion has also been eliminated. In addition to the revised requirements, the program may be completed in any order, but the final interview must be the final step.

Authorised in 1846, the line opened in 1849 and ran from in Cheshire to in East Staffordshire. The line was closed in several stages between 1964 and 1988 but part of the central section passed into the hands of a preservation society and today operates as the Churnet Valley Railway. Origins Various proposals were put forward for a line through the Churnet Valley in the 1830s and in 1841 plans were published by the Manchester & Derby Railway (Churnet Valley) Company for a line from Macclesfield to Derby via Leek, Cheadle, Rocester and Uttoxeter. At Macclesfield the line would connect with the Grand Junction Railway and at Derby with the North Midland Railway and would result a direct route between Manchester and London.Jeuda pp. 15-17. In 1844 the company by now renamed simply the Churnet Valley Railway Company laid out its prospectus for construction of the line in 1844 and following approval of the plan by the Board of Trade preparation was made for the necessary approval of Parliament to be sought. As the draft bill was being considered by the House of Commons the directors of the company agreed an amalgamation with the Trent Valley Railway and the Staffordshire Potteries Railway to form the Churnet, Potteries and Trent Junction Railway soon to be called the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR). The Churnet Valley bill was withdrawn and in 1846 a new bill was submitted to Parliament entitled the North Staffordshire Railway (Churnet Valley Line) Bill.Christiansen & Miller p. 29. The merger of the three companies had not been without opposition and many shareholders of the Churnet Valley company were worried that the Churnet Valley line would become a small adjunct to the other NSR lines between Derby-Crewe and Macclesfield-Colwich. After negotiation it became a stipulation of the bill that the dividend of the NSR could not exceed 5% until the Churnet Valley line was fully open.Jeuda p. 20. With this concession granted the bill proceeded through Parliament and received Royal Assent on 26 June 1846. Allocated capital for the lines was ¬£1,200,000. Construction The tender for construction of the line was let in 1847 to J & S Tredwell for a price of ¬£330,218. Construction began in September 1847 and in November 1847 a champagne party was held underground to celebrate the laying of the first brick in Nab Hill tunnel near Leek.Jeuda p. 22. Work on the section south of Leek involved diverting the River Churnet at Consall and also one of the first instance of a canal being converted into a railway with closure of the Uttoxeter Canal and it being used as the track bed between Froghall and Uttoxeter. The conversion had been made possible by the acquisition of the Trent and Mersey Canal and its subsidiaries, the Caldon Canal and the Uttoxeter Canal, by the NSR as part of the 1846 act.Christiansen & Miller p. 41. Work on the line was concluded in 1849 and the line of opened to both passenger and goods traffic on 13 July 1849. Operation Although originally planned as a main route between Manchester and Derby the line became, as many shareholders had worried, something of a backwater. Through trains required co-operation with the LNWR, something that the NSR did not have for many yearsJeuda p. 30. and when good relations with the LNWR were settled some through services were run but not as many as once anticipated. Train services settled to a small number of local trains between Macclesfield and Uttoxeter supplemented by a smaller number of slightly shorter workings e.g. Macclesfield--Leek. A lot of excursions were run over the line as the NSR made efforts to promote Rudyard Lake as a tourist destination. The lake, actually a reservoir, supplied water to the Trent & Mersey Canal and had therefore become the property of the NSR in 1846. However the NSR only owned the lake, not the land around it and protracted legal proceedings meant that the NSR were not fully able to promote Rudyard until the early part of the 20th century.Jeuda p. 35. Another important tourist destination for the NSR was also served by the line; Alton Towers, owned by the Earl of Shrewsbury, was open to the public on several days during the summer and the NSR provided special trains on these occasions. The NSR were not the only group seeking to promote the Churnet Valley as a tourist destination and through the efforts of a number of local hoteliers the valley became known as \\"Little Switzerland\\". Despite the picturesque description which arose from the valley's steep sides, the area was also an important site in the mineral industry with iron and copper as well as limestone and sandstone being quarried. Previously carried by canal, the output from the quarries and the associated industries was moved by rail especially when the NSR opened a line from Stoke to Leek in 1867. Principal among these were the copper wire works at Froghall and Oakamoor and the limestone quarries at Caldon Low. The latter was also owned by the NSR and moved stone from the quarry to Froghall station via a narrow gauge railway. At one point over 1000 tons a week was being shipped from Froghall to Brunner Mond.Jeuda p. 105. London Midland Scottish years Along with the rest of the NSR the line passed into the ownership of the London, Midland and Scottish railway (LMS) which made little change to the operation of the line. Passenger services remained much as they had done under the NSR,Jeuda p. 145. but Alton Towers became an increasingly popular tourist destination and frequent excursions terminated there. Further north, at Rudyard, there were quite a few changes as the LMS sold off the golf club and the Rudyard Hotel. One result was a confusing change of station names; Rudyard Lake was renamed Cliffe Park, and Rudyard was renamed Rudyard Lake.Jeuda p. 148 One long distance train ran over the line, the Saturdays-only Eastern Counties Express between Manchester and Cromer ran in both directions along the Churnet Valley, stopping only at Leek to pick up/set down passengers to or from beyond Nottingham.Jeuda p. 149 Freight traffic suffered from the effects of the Great Depression, the most notable casualty being the ceastion of operations at Caldon Low quarries, although they subsequent re-opened when the LMS found a lessee for the quarry.Christiansen & Miller p. 256. The narrow gauge line between the quarry and Froghall closed in 1936 and all output was shipped via the Waterhouses branch, which left the Churnet Valley line at Leekbrook Junction. =Wartime services= With the outbreak of World War II the line as with most British railways moved to an emergency timetable. The Churnet Valley was unusual in that the basic service was improved in terms of number of services even if the timings were slower. The increase in services was due to Bolton's at Froghall being an important munitions site and Alton Towers becoming 121 Officer Cadet Training Unit, Royal Artillery.Jeuda p. 147 British Railways Following nationalisation, the line became part of the London Midland Region of British Railways. Passenger services remained fairly consistent with the wartime levels of five 'up' trains and six 'down' trains a day with additional workmen's services between Leek and Uttoxeter. Falling passenger numbers throughout the 1950s led to a proposal in 1959 for the withdrawal of all advertised passenger services between Macclesfield and Uttoxeter and the retention of the non-advertised workmen's services between Leek and Uttoxeter only.Jeuda pp. 157-161. Despite objections the proposal was implemented on 7 November 1960. This did not stem the financial losses on the line, and the entire line between Leek and North Rode closed in June 1964. At the same time local goods facilities were withdrawn at all other stations except LeekChristiansen & Miller pp. 306-308. followed in January 1965 by the withdrawal of the passenger service over the south section between Leek and Uttoxeter and the closure of the line south of Oakamoor. This left the line with public goods services from Leek to Stoke and bulk sand traffic from Oakamoor. The Leek services lasted until 1970 when the line between Leek and Leek Brook Junction closedJeuda p. 166 but the Oakamoor sand traffic continued until 1988.Jeuda p. 169 Preservation In 1971 a preservation society, the Cheshire and Staffordshire Railway Society, were looking for a site. One of their first possible locations was the section of line between Rudyard and Leek but this fell through with the demolition of the Leek station buildings in 1973. Still looking for a site the society now renamed the North Staffordshire Railway Society managed to secure a lease on from its new owners, Staffordshire County Council. Despite not having access to the track through the station, as this was then part of the line to the Sand Sidings at Oakamoor, the members established a small heritage site. However, with the withdrawal of the last goods services from Oakamoor in 1988, the society was able to take over the line and commence bigger operations. Since then the society has reopened the railway stations at Cheddleton, Consall and Kingsley & Froghall. Another section of the trackbed is occupied by the Rudyard Lake Steam Railway, a gauge tourist line which runs beside Rudyard Lake. It was established in 1985 by Peter Hanton of Congleton, who completed its construction in 1993, but sold it to an operating company in 2000 due to poor health.

Only a single aircraft was built, with the type not being chosen for production. Design and development The Port Victoria Depot's second design, designated Port Victoria P.V.2 was a floatplane fighter intended to intercept German Zeppelins. The P.V.2 was a small single engined biplane, powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four blage propellor. It was of wood and fabric construction, and of sesquiplane configuration, i.e. with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing (both of which used the high-lift wing sections pioneered by the P.V.1). Unusually, the aircraft's wing bracing struts also carried the aircraft's floats, forming a \\"W\\" shape when viewed from the front. The upper wing was attached directly to the top of the fuselage, giving a good field of fire for the intended armament of a single 2-lb Davis gun recoilless gun. The P.V.2 first flew on 16 June 1916, and demonstrated good performance and handling. The upper wing, however, while giving excellent upwards view to the pilot, gave a poor downwards view of the pilot, particularly during landing, while the Davis gun had lost favour with the Admiralty as an anti-Zeppelin weapon. The P.V.2 was therefore rebuilt as the P.V.2bis with a revised, longer span upper wing mounted 12 inches (0.30 m) above the fuselage and the Davis gun replaced by two Lewis guns mounted above the wing, firing over the propellor. The modified aircraft first flew in this form in early 1917.Collyer 1991, p.50. While the P.V.2bis again showed excellent handling, the RNAS's requirement for a floatplane anti-Zeppelin fighter had lapsed, and no production was ordered.

Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management. Vol. 1. April 1996 Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM) was a 1990s reference model for enterprise architecture by and for the United States Department of Defense (DoD). TAFIM provided enterprise-level guidance for the evolution of the DoD Technical infrastructure. It identifies the services, standards, concepts, components, and configurations that can be used to guide the development of technical architectures that meet specific mission requirements.NHSITRC (2005). Consolidated References IT Planning and Management Guides, List of Resources. Last Updated: May 4, 2005. Accessed 12 Dec 2008. TAFIM has been developed by the United States Department of Defense from 1986 until 1999. Parallel in 1994 they started the development of the C4ISR Architecture Framework, which evolved into the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) in the new millennium. TAFIM concepts are further developed in TOGAF, which first version in 1995 was based on the TAFIM framework.  Overview  The \\"Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management\\" (TAFIM) was described in 1995 as: Constance Golden (1995). A STANDARD SATELLITE CONTROL REFERENCE MODEL. NASA. * a target common conceptual framework or reference model for an information system infrastructure * and the specific applications that the information system must support. This architecture, and associated model, is not a specific system design. Rather, it establishes a common vocabulary and defines a set of services and interfaces common to information systems. It identifies standards and guidelines in terms of the architecture services and interfaces. The architecture serves to facilitate the development of plans that will lead to interoperability between mission area applications, portability across mission areas and cost reductions through the use of common services. TAFIM subsumes the widely accepted Open-system environment reference model within the network services and communications area.  History  The eight-volume TAFIM documentation with the further architecture implementation concept. The development of TAFIM started around 1986 at the US Defense Information Systems Agency/Center for Information Management. The first concept of TAFIM was derived from the NIST Application Portability Profile and the POSIX (or IEEE P1003.00SE) model. The first draft of TAFIM was completed in 1991 with the TAFIM Technical Reference Model (TAFIM TRM). Developed by a team led by Burnes St. Patrick Hollyman, James M. Kerr and John Keane, this technical reference model wanted to use open systems and new technologies available in the commercial market, to develop a DoD-wide application.Patricia A. Oberndorf and Anthony Earl (1998). Department of Veterans Affairs Reference Models. SEI Carnegie Mellon University. The TAFIM project has resulted in an eight-volume Information Technology Architecture \\"how-to\\" manual, see image. Before being officially published in 1996 by the Department of Defense, the approach was successfully piloted at both the U.S. Marine Corps and the DoD Health Affairs by teams led by Hollyman, Kerr, Keane. The original development of TOGAF Version 1 in 1995 was based on the Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management. The US Department of Defense gave The Open Group explicit permission and encouragement to create TOGAF by building on the TAFIM, which itself was the result of many years of development effort and many millions of dollars of US Government investment.Welcome to TOGAF Version 9 -- The Open Group Architecture Framework Accessed 03 Feb 2009. The 1996 US DoD publication on TAFIM was the latest version published.Jaap Schekkerman (2003). How to Survive in the Jungle of Enterprise Architecture Frameworks. p.173. TAFIM has been cancelled as a stand-alone document in 1999. In 2000 the whole TAFIM concept and its regulations have been re-evaluated and found inconsistent with the newly developed DoDAF architecture direction. For this reason all references to TAFIM have been removed from DoD documentation since then. TAFIM was abruptly cancelled due to the following flawsPerks, C., and Beveridge, T. (2003). Guide to Enterprise IT Architecture. New York, NY: Springer.: * TAFIM required a large investment of both time and money * The elapsed time required to produce the architecture makes it close to obsolete before completion * Architectures of such complexity required specialized and reasonably uncommon IT expertise to complete.

Its standard definitions for data elements are intended to ensure that users of all Defense systems define the same data in the same way and have a common understanding of their meaning. Defense has developed or is in the process of defining technical standards in the 1990s with the Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM), the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), and the Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE).GAO (1998) DEFENSE IRM United States General Accounting Office. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for developing, obtaining from commercial sources, and maintaining the compilation of Defense Information Infrastructure technical standards, and it is responsible for maintaining a Defense data dictionary system as a repository of data requirements and for facilitating the cross-functional coordination and approval of standard formats, definitions, etc. PSAs, the military services, Defense agencies, and Joint Chiefs of Staff are responsible for reaching agreement on the standards and approving them as DOD standard data elements. DISA is then responsible for disseminating the approved standard data elements for use throughout the Department. = DoD Standards-Based Architecture Planning Process = DoD Standards-Based Architecture Planning ProcessDepartment of Defense (1996). Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management. Vol. 4. April 1996 The Standards-Based Architecture (SBA) planning process. defined by the TAFIM, consists of seven distinct, but interdependent, phases. Each phase of the SBA process is intended to create specific deliverable products and or documents, that guide the subsequent phase. The seven phases are briefly outlined below. * Phase 1, Initiation and Architecture Framework : The methodology begins with a proper initiation of the process within the host organization. This involves developing a set of strategic drivers for the organization. Further, a business model is reviewed or built to establish a strategic target operation model. * Phase 2. Baseline Characterization : This grounding phase intends to determine the organization's current architecture. It is an assessment of the current environment, which results in a characterization in four key dimensions or views: work, information, application and technology. * Phase 3. Target Architecture : The various views of the framework are modeled in terms of a desirable target architecture, usually 3 to 5 years in the future. * Phase 4. Opportunity Identification : Step from the conceptual reflection to practical realities and implementation, with determination of development projects needed. * Phase 5. Migration Options : Links the reality of the present with the desirability of the target architecture by establishing one or more plateaus representing practical migration stages. * Phase 6. Implementation Planning : Phase results in a detailed implementation plan for the first plateau of the migration effort. * Phase 7. Institutionalizing the ITA Process : This phase is intended to keep the architecture alive and well by continuously improving it. = Integrated Model of Architectural Views = Integrated Model of Four Architectural Views. The \\"Integrated Model of Four Architectural Views\\" is part of the target architecture, defined in the TAFIM. It gives a vision on the organization in all of its architectural views, especially the work architecture. The model, see figure, depicts an overall framework to develop the target architecture deliverable. Each view of the target architecture has some overlap with aspects of the other views. This overlap supports the argument that the model depicts the developing of a single, integrated architecture. The entire enterprise, as defined, includes Work organization, Information, Application, and Technology. This leads to the four different views: * Work Organization View : The work view of architecture is developed by identifying specific classes of users within the business environment (e.g. executives, planners, administrators, engineers, recruiters), business location (e.g. headquarters, sales office, plant, warehouse); and the logical representation of the business functions that are required to deliver products and services. * Information Management View : The information architecture of the enterprise will contain three levels of detail, subject areas, data groups, and data attributes. * Application View : This view focuses on the opportunities to autonomate aspects of work and or the access to information needed to perform work. * Technology Infrastructure View : This areas of architecture uses specific component-level models to provide the basic for linking the technology view of the architecture to the work, information, and application views. The linchpin is the generic application environment.

The Boys Club follows Julie's struggles in her tomboy childhood in rural Michigan and her early-career drug use, her battles with fellow jockeys and the media and her climb up the jockey success ladder, the horrific 1993 racetrack accident that crushed her leg and chest, and her painful determination to make a comeback - all part of her hard-hitting fight to become a female jockey in the male-dominated world of horse racing. Despite a series of debilitating falls and challenges, by the time Julie retired in 1999, she had won 3,545 races and more than $81 million in purse earnings. First edition *Little Brown & Co, 1995.

It is a spoof of mid-1990s films in general, and violent, convoluted films more specifically; the overall story is a send-up of 1994's Pulp Fiction, complete with intertitles and an out-of- sequence storyline, with other movies such as Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers also parodied. Plot At the start of the movie, Don LaFontaine's voice talks about how Quentin Tarantino started a trend of extremely violent movies, and says that the time has come for much more wholesome, life- affirming movies ‚Äî and he is cut off as someone shoots him. The body of the film contains the following intertwined plotlines: * Jimmy Nova and Julius are two exterminators, required to dress as hitmen; they work for Montello, who also owns a strip club. Jimmy is assigned by Montello to look after his wife, Mimi, while he's out of town; her over-eating and wild behavior get herself and Jimmy into one mess after another, including being imprisoned by a convenience store owner and his pet \\"gimp\\" Nell. Jimmy and Mimi eventually drive off to Mexico together. * Some of Montello's strippers concoct a plan to steal Montello's money; they disguise themselves as nuns and use fake names, including Sister Sister, Sister Sledge, and Sister Bertrille. The plan goes awry, and one of the nuns is wounded. As trust between the criminals breaks down, they all draw weapons on each other (including a blowtorch and a crossbow), but suddenly they're all gunned down by film director Crispin Maraschino, who's making a movie in the next room and doesn't want to be disturbed. * Nicky and Vallory Cox, a pair of tag-team wrestlers called the Natural Blonde Killers, blame their lot on a terrible movie made about them by Gulliver Stone. They steal a seemingly valuable suitcase from Montello and go into hiding; while on the run, Nicky accidentally leaves the suitcase in a booth at The Independent Cafe, a theme restaurant whose theme is independent films. The two of them go back to retrieve it, and find themselves in a showdown with Julius (whom they'd encountered earlier). The contents of the suitcase turn out to be an old Welcome Back, Kotter lunch box and several orange glow sticks. The Coxes both wind up shot by Julius. * Bunny Roberts has written a violent film that Crispin Maraschino is shooting, but he doesn't have a copy of the script; she sends her friend Bumpkin to deliver her last copy to Maraschino. As Bumpkin runs to the studio, he occasionally bumps into the other characters, each time dropping the script pages and having to pick them up again. When he finally gets to the studio, the script is a convoluted mess, and Maraschino loves it; the title is revealed to be Plump Fiction. Bunny, meanwhile, winds up dead in the showdown between Julius and the Coxes. After the credits, a server at the Independent Cafe (who calls himself Priscilla, Queen of the Desserts) looks into the camera and says, \\"This has been one long, mixed-up, crazy, out-of-sequence kind of day!\\" Cast * Pamela Adlon as Vallory Cox * Philippe Bergeron as Jean-Claude Ennui * Sandra Bernhard as Bunny Roberts * Julie Brown as Mimi Hungry * Colleen Camp as Viv * Dan Castellaneta as Bumpkin * Jennifer Coolidge as Sister Sister * Robert Costanzo as Montello Hungry * Tommy Davidson as Julius * Lezlie Deane as Jodi/The Gimp * Lea DeLaria as Mr. Purple * Nada Despotovich as Sister Bertrille * Paul Dinello as Jimmy Nova * Matthew Glave as Nicky Cox * Kent Gregory (uncredited) as Diner patron * Shawn Michael Howard as Lee * Tim Kazurinsky as Priscilla, Queen of the Desserts * Simbi Khali as Sister Sledge * Bob Koherr as Grip * Don LaFontaine as Voice-over, at start of film * Scott LaRose as Karaoke customer * Kevin Meaney as Les * Stephen Nemith as Convenience store clerk #1 * Molly O'Leary as Waitress * Kane Picoy as Kris Walken Kringle * Paul Provenza as Crispin Maraschino * Riki Rachtman as Convenience store clerk #2 * Jennifer Rubin as Kandi Kane * Donna W.

Poster The poster is a parody of the Pulp Fiction poster: * In the Pulp poster, Mia has a lit cigarette in one hand and is resting the other on a pulp magazine; in the Plump poster, Mimi is holding a lollipop in one hand and resting the other on a copy of The Joy of Cooking. * Whereas the Pulp poster says, \\"Winner of the Palme d'Or, Cannes Film Festival,\\" the Plump poster says, \\"Winner of the Palm d'Hors d'oeuvre, Canned Food Festivals.\\" Home media Plump Fiction has been released on VHS videocassette and DVD.

It is often designed to have a \\"pioneer\\" look. Log furniture is often very durable and long-lasting, depending on the manufacturing methods used. Log furniture, reclaimed wood furniture, and other types of rustic furniture have increased in popularity in recent years. As a result, there are many more styles and options available for those looking to furnish their mountain lodges, country homes, or log cabins. The more economical lines of log furniture are typically milled by machine and are massed produced. Shoppers looking for unique style may opt for the more expensive collections of handcrafted, one-of-a-kind log furniture. Manufacturing Methods There are various types of log furniture, from the sleek finished look to the rustic ‚Äòcraggy‚Äô look. Building log furniture is time-consuming, and since most pieces are custom built, it can often be quite expensive. The mortise and tenon method is favored for its strength. Wood Types Log furniture can be manufactured from almost any type of wood as long as the timbers that are used have adequate dimensions and strength. Some of the most popular types of wood include aspen, steam-bent hickory, pine, aromatic red cedar, northern white cedar, walnut, and willow. Some log furniture is made from exotic woods such as osage orange. Usage Log furniture is often featured in country and holiday houses. It is a popular choice for cottage houses and mountain homes. It is most commonly favored in mountainous regions of America (Rocky Mountains) and Europe (Alps). It is often classified as premium furniture because its cost is higher than the cost of what is considered regular furniture. Because of its nature, log furniture can be a good choice for outdoor use. With the right impregnation, it can last decades without the need of refurbishing. It rose to popularity again in the 2000s after years of decline, caused by accessibility of cheap furniture substitutes. It has now become a sign of wealth and good taste. The log furniture industry is often aimed at local markets, making it a good choice for buyers looking to support the local community. Log furniture is strongly associated with Christmas decor in both America and Europe. Checking Certain cracks in logs are referred to as \\"checks\\" or \\"checking.\\" Checking is part of the natural drying process of the wood and normally does not affect the structural integrity of the log. Checks are cracks that run vertically (with the grain). These checks can be as much as three-quarters of an inch in width, depending on the diameter of the log.

It was founded in 1989 in a garage in Ventura, California, by Dave Duffy and his seven-year-old daughter, Annie. After publication of the second issue, Duffy met Ilene Myers, who became his wife and partner-in-publication. Backwoods Home remains family- owned. It is based in Philomath, Oregon. Backwoods Home's articles and columns emphasize practical skills and projects for rural living. Typical topics include building your own structures, growing crops, earning a living in the country, frugal living, cooking and baking, raising animals, harvesting wild foods, homegrown energy, emergency preparedness, self-healthcare, and buying and using firearms. The magazine also features historic and scientific \\"debunking\\" articles by long-time senior editor, John Silveira. Backwoods Home is also known for its libertarian and libertarian-conservative editorial viewpoints.  History and philosophy  Dave Duffy, then a technical writer and former journalist, and his seven-year-old daughter Annie started the magazine with no money other than an occasional freelance paycheck in 1989. They initially published it from a garage in Ventura, in Southern California. Duffy's original concept was for a book called Build a Backwoods Home for Under $10,000. The book was to be based on his experience constructing an off- grid home in the Siskiyou mountains of Oregon, to which he was commuting every few months. He started the magazine as a means of advertising the proposed book. The first issue, with a print run of 6,000, came out in October 1989 and was distributed free and by hand by Duffy and Annie. A few months later, the publication was picked up by a national distributor, American Distribution Services of Northbrook, Illinois (now defunct). The book was never completed. Backwoods Home has been called \\"what Mother Earth News used to be\\" ‚Äì that is, a no-frills, back-to-basics resource for country dwellers and those hoping to move to the country. At the time of Backwoods Home's founding, Mother Earth had become a more \\"slick\\" publication. However, Duffy says he had never heard of Mother Earth News at that time, and that among his chief inspirations were scientific publications from the Middle Ages. Duffy has said, \\"Although the emphasis has always been on self-reliance, I rode the environmental wagon a bit back then to try and attract subscribers, but quickly gave it up and followed my Libertarian leanings. My model was a type of scientific journal from the Middle Ages ... that mixed how-to advice like wine and bread making with scientific articles. I decided to mix self-reliant articles with freedom articles. It was what interested me. It was both interesting to me ‚Äì and I felt was important to everyone ‚Äì to both understand how to do things for yourself and to understand how freedom worked. John Silveira, my friend since age 20, was an important element of this mix, as he had the intellect and research ability to write the critical freedom articles. The backbone of BHM has always been, and is today, the how-to article.\\" The magazine has for many years had a consistent circulation of 41,000, of which approximately 36,000 is subscription and 5,000 newsstand sales. The economic troubles of late 2008 and 2009 led to a substantial increase in visits to its website. The print version of the magazine was discontinued in 2018 and was only available on Amazon Kindle. The magazine was brought back to the print world in 2019 by Duffy's youngest son, Sam Duffy, under the auspices of Self-Reliance Publications LLC.

The Epistle to the Hebrews is placed before 1 Timothy. It contains scholia, lectionary markings were added by a later hand. It contains a large number of notes drawn from early church fathers (Irenaeus, Clement, Origen, Eusebius, and Basil), but none later than Basil (329-379 CE), suggesting a relatively early date for 1739's exemplar. The text of this manuscript often agrees with p46 and Codex Vaticanus.

After rising from relative obscurity in 1926 to win a nationwide fiddle contest hosted by automobile magnate Henry Ford, Stephens went on to record several tracks for Columbia Records and made several guest appearances on what would later become the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville before retiring to his farm near Lynchburg, Tennessee.Don Roberson, \\"John L. \\"Uncle Bunt\\" Stephens . Retrieved: 12 December 2008. His style of fiddle playing is believed to resemble a style that was popular before the American Civil War.Andrew Kuntz, \\"Sail Away Ladies.\\" Retrieved: 12 December 2008. Life =Early life= Stephens was born in Bedford County, Tennessee on February 2, 1879 (although some sources suggest he was older). He was orphaned at a young age and raised by his aunt in Flatcreek, a small community located about halfway between Lynchburg and Shelbyville. When he was 11, he bought a fiddle from a tramp, and taught himself how to play.Charles Wolfe, \\"Notes to Volume 2.\\" In Nashville: The Early String Bands Vol. 2 (pp. 8-9) [CD liner notes]. County Records, 2000. He began performing at local square dances in 1896, and played regularly at various events throughout the early 1900s. Over the years, Stephens' repertoire grew to include folk tunes such as \\"Sail Away Lady\\", \\"The Arkansas Traveler\\", and \\"Mississippi Sawyer.\\" Others included \\"Candy Girl\\", \\"Left in the Dark Blues\\", and \\"Louisburg Blues\\", all of which he later recorded. His favorite tune was probably \\"Old Hen Cackled,\\" which is believed to have won him the blue ribbon at the Ford fiddlers' contest in 1926. =The Ford contest= In early 1926, Ford Motor Company executives attempted to improve sales by capitalizing on the phenomenal media success of Maine fiddler Mellie Dunham's visit in December 1925 to Henry Ford and in the thousands who came to a Tuesday evening appearance at a Detroit ballroom of Ford's own old-time dance orchestra. During the second week of January, the orchestra broadcast from the Ford showroom on Broadway in New York. An experimental network of radio stations around the country was organized. Local Ford dealers were to participate by getting loudspeakers and inviting the public in to dance to the broadcasts. The two broadcasts were on Tuesday and Friday. However, the Cincinnati station did not operate on Friday. To get around this situation, Ford dealers in Kentucky quickly organized fiddlers' contests, as did those in Tennessee and southern Indiana, all areas covered by the Cincinnati station.Paul M. Gifford, \\"Henry Ford's Dance Revival and Fiddle Contests: Myth and Reality,\\" Journal of the Society for American Music 4, n. 3 (Aug. 2010): 330-332. After capturing first prize at the Ford dealership in Lynchburg, Stephens proceeded to the Tennessee statewide contest in Nashville, which began on the morning of January 19, 1926. Stephens survived the first round of the state contest, and with five other finalists, was selected to play at a sold-out Ryman Auditorium that night to decide which three fiddlers the state would send to the Southeast regional contest. Stephens won third place behind Uncle Jimmy Thompson and a one-armed fiddler from Hartsville named Marshall Claiborne. The \\"Champion of Dixie\\" contest took place at Brown Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky on January 26‚Äì27, 1926. The three finalists from Tennessee competed against three finalists from Kentucky and two from southern Indiana. Stephens won second place behind Indiana fiddler W.H. Elmore, and, being in the top three, earned a trip to Detroit. On February 9‚Äì10, 1926, Stephens, along with Elmore and Claiborne, played at a banquet in Dearborn that was held during a convention of Ford dealers from around the country. Henry Ford was present. No contest was held.Gifford, \\"Henry Ford's Dance Revival and Fiddle Contests\\" =Recording and performing career= After his appearance in Detroit, Stephens went on a tour in an attempt to replicate the commercial success of Mellie Dunham. Stephens played at various venues across the Eastern United States, which included a radio guest spot in Chicago and several guest appearances on the Grand Ole Opry (then called the WSM Barn Dance) in Nashville. In March 1926, Stephens traveled to New York to record several sides for Columbia Records. They remain his only known recordings. In conversations with reporters, Stephens exaggerated the nature of his appearance before Ford, making himself out to be the winner of a series of national contests, when in fact Ford never held any such contest. Stephens died at his home near Lynchburg on July 25, 1951. He is buried at the Hurricane Church Cemetery just outside Lynchburg. After his death, his recording of \\"Sail Away Lady\\" was analyzed by ethnomusicologist Harry Smith, who believed it to be played in a style that pre-dated the American Civil War.

Biography Boyd Kosiyabong was born on 5 September 1967, the third of five children. Having great interest in animated cartoons and music, he started taking piano lessons by the age of four but soon had to give up formal lessons which could not satisfy his specific interest in cartoon soundtracks. He became self-taught afterwards, learning to play the theme songs of his favourite cartoons and beginning to compose by the time he was in sixth grade. He had wished to study animation, but being unable to do so he followed the path of his other interest, music. He studied song writing, electronic music and music business at University of California, Los Angeles. Early in his career he worked as a freelance songwriter for musical artists and advertising. After a few years, he joined Kamol Sukosol Clapp, Somkiat Ariyachaipanich and Salinee Panyarachun in founding Bakery Music, an independent music label, in 1994. Among the first of the label's acts was Modern Dog, which quickly proved successful. Boyd was widely noted for his roles as composer and manager of Bakery Music. His compositions were mainly romantic and inspirational songs, such as Seasons Change, which topped the charts upon its release in 1995 and later became the namesake of the 2007 film of the same name. With the rapid growth of Bakery Music, Boyd began expanding investments into the other businesses, founding the animation studio Be Boyd Characters (now Be Boyd CG) in 1997, while partner Somkiat created the Dojo City label, which catered to young female audiences, and Bakery Music also expanded into publishing, with the magazines Katch and Manga Katch. However, the company later faced management and economic issues, and was acquired in 2000 by BMG, which in turn merged with Sony Music Entertainment to become Sony BMG in 2004. At this point, Boyd, along with the original founders of Bakery Music, left the management, while Bakery Music remains today as a sublabel of Sony. Boyd and Kamol Sukosol Clapp then formed a new partnership and created a new label, Love Is, in 2004. Kamol later left to work in other businesses, and Love Is was restructured as a production house company. Personally, Boyd is a devout Christian and attends church every Sunday.

He is well known for being a television presenter on political discussions and on Muslim channels. Early life Masroor was born in Sylhet District, Bangladesh and came to Britain at the age of one when his parents immigrated from the country. He moved back to Bangladesh a few years later at the age of nine due to his father's concerns about different cultures and the possibility of losing their Muslim identities. However, they returned when he was at the age of 13. When living in the East End, Masroor experienced racism against the Bangladeshis in the areas, with properties being damaged. He was brought up in Shadwell, and attended the Bluegate Fields School on Cable Street. He is the oldest of six children. At the age of 19, his father attempted to force him into a marriage in Bangladesh, but was unsuccessful because Masroor challenged his father, saying forced marriage is not acceptable in Islam. He then married a Hungarian, Henrietta Szovati (who had converted to Islam), and they now have two children. After his GCSEs and A Levels, he was very active in student unions and Islamic societies. Career Masroor is a local imam, who leads Friday prayers weekly at four different mosques in London: Goodge Street mosque, Palmers Green mosque, West Ealing mosque and Wightman Road mosque in Haringey.

He currently presents his own programmes on Islam Channel and on Channel S, where he presents an English programme called Let's Talk. He is also part of the panel in a programme broadcast by Channel 4, called Shariah TV. On Channel 4, he also presented a programme called Make Me a Muslim - he asks six non-Muslims and one lapsed Muslim to follow Islamic teachings for three weeks. On 10 May 2009, Masroor presented a programme called \\"Celebrity Lives - Sharia Style\\" which was broadcast on BBC One. He has also appeared on major news channels such as the BBC, CNN and many other channels as a commentator on social, political and religious issues. On 30 January 2011, he appeared on the BBC show The Big Questions, and in 2019 he appeared on BBC's Newsnight. In October 2013, Masroor was alerted by anti-terrorist police that he and a number of other prominent Muslim figures in the UK who had spoken out against Islamist extremism were targeted by a propaganda video created by Al-Shabaab, the terrorist group responsible for the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya: the video urged jihadists in the UK to take action, citing the murder of Lee Rigby as an example to follow. Interviewed by Al Jazeera, Masroor said of the video: \\"It is a terrible piece of work and the content is vile and disgusting and horrific in many ways. It is a group of people who are glorifying violence and death. It didn't make me scared. It just made me angry and more determined.\\" In July 2015, Masroor was interviewed by Nadia Ali on BBC Asian Network about his Ramadan memories. In October 2018 the Muslim World League fired him from the Fitzrovia Mosque for criticizing Saudi Arabia and crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, following remarks he made about the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi and corruption in the royal family.https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-imam-fired-saudi-funded-mosque- criticising-saudi-royal-family-312296296 The Muslim World League released a statement saying \\"But since he continued provoking public opinion against the individuals, governments, causing stir in the society, shaming and accusing falsely, no option was left but to stop dealing with him in anyway.\\"http://www.mwllo.org.uk/press-release/#more-1979 Personal life Masroor currently lives in Haringey, London. His interests include learning about new cultures and world food, playing badminton, and reading based on history, society and politics. On 17 December 2015, Masroor was stopped by a U.S. embassy staff from boarding Virgin Atlantic flight at Heathrow Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Masroor was informed that his U.S. business visa had been revoked and received no further explanation as to why he was being prevented from travelling, despite travelling to the U.S. four times earlier in the year. On 22 December, he was invited to the U.S. embassy to speak about the matter but was still not given a reason, nor an apology. On 13 January 2016, it was reported that he was prevented from travelling to the U.S. and his visa was revoked over concerns about one of his 28,000 Facebook followers. Masroor set up a website, called www.flyingwhilemuslim.org.uk, so other Muslims can document any similar experiences they have faced while trying to travel to U.S. Awards and nominations In January 2013 and 2015, Masroor was nominated for the Religious Advocate of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 1974, due to its architectural significance. History The house was built in 1824 by Turner Saunders, a Methodist minister and planter originally from Brunswick County, Virginia. After living in the house for a little more than a decade, Saunders sold it in 1844 to Freeman Goode. The house was later acquired by the Hall family and then, in the 1940s, it passed into the care of the Mauldin family when they purchased the farm property that the house sits on. It remains in the Mauldin family today, although they have never resided there because of its remote nature. Architecture The house is built in a provincial interpretation of a Palladian three-part plan, possibly influenced by the Jeffersonian architecture of Saunders' native Virginia. The cramped proximity of the three front triangular pediments betray the vernacular nature of the composition, although the remainder is well-proportioned. The entire house is constructed in brick above a raised basement. The two-story main block features a Tuscan portico with an arched lunette in the pediment, this feature was a common Jeffersonian architectural device. The main block is flanked to either side by one-story wings with front and side gables, their front pediments also have lunettes. The front walls of the wings feature brick pilasters with simple capitals. The front door is noteworthy in that it features two engaged Tuscan columns supporting a molded cornice. The Goode‚ÄìHall House was not the only large plantation house built in the area by the Saunders family. Turner Saunder's son, James, built a large Italianate house at Rocky Hill Castle.

Established by the local Turkish Australian community, the club competes in the National Premier Leagues Victoria. The club, known by the local Turkish Australian community as Anadoluspor, is the most successful Turkish Australian-backed football club in Australia. Hume City has senior men's, women's and junior boys and girls teams, all based out of John Ilhan Memorial Reserve. History The club was established as Holland Park Football Club in 1979 by Cengiz Binyazar, Halit Kirdar and Abdullah Saglam. The club officially registered with the Victorian Soccer Federation in 1979, with Emin Aslan holding the position of president in its inaugural season. In 1993, the club decided on a change of direction and to take the club to higher places, out of the amateur divisions. The first step was the move to Reddish Reserve and to rename the club North Coburg Soccer Club. The club took on many more juniors. North Coburg achieved promotion from State League 4 in 1996, finishing the season in second place, and promoted again from State League 3 in 1999, finishing third. In the club's first ever season in Victorian State League Division 2 Nth-West it finished in fourth place, narrowly missing out on a promotion playoff place. In 2001, the club made the finals series after placing 3rd in the league but didn't win the playoff. In 2002, after coming close the previous two season, the club achieved promotion from State League 2 N/W to State League 1, the highest level the club had ever reached. The club achieved four successive mid-table finishes in State League 1. In 2006, the club was known as Coburg United Soccer Club and played its home matches at Knights Stadium in North Sunshine, Victoria. North Coburg achieved promotion in 2007 after a 2nd-place finish to reach the Victorian Premier League for the first time in the club's history. The achievement marked a meteoric rise by the club, achieving four promotions in eleven years to go from State League 4 to the top division. After making it into the Premier League in 2007, the club was almost relegated if it wasn't for a 93rd-minute header by one of its local heroes Tansel Ba≈üer against Frankston Pines. The club was renamed to Hume City Football Club in 2009, when they moved to their new facilities at Broadmeadows Valley Park, in the City of Hume. A huge occasion was marked in 2014 when Hume officially opened up its new $12m facilities which included three grass pitches, a \\"3G\\" pitch, a state- of-the-art grandstand and modern clubrooms and changeroom facilities. The club underwent yet another re-brand in 2015, changing their logo \\"for a new identity, to represent the club's past, present and future\\".http://humecityfc.com/history/ Hume managed a 6th-placed finish in 2014, the first season of the newly formed 14 team National Premier Leagues Victoria, what was former known as the Victorian Premier League.

In response to reactions to her comment, Nasr wrote on July 6 an explanation of what she meant with her tweet. > I used the words \\"respect\\" and \\"sad\\" because to me as a Middle Eastern > woman, Fadlallah took a contrarian and pioneering stand among Shia clerics > on woman's rights. He called for the abolition of the tribal system of > \\"honor killing.\\" He called the practice primitive and non-productive. He > warned Muslim men that abuse of women was against Islam. Nasr concluded her statement by saying: > Sayyed Fadlallah. Revered across borders yet designated a terrorist. Not the > kind of life to be commenting about in a brief tweet. It's something I > deeply regret. A CNN spokesman responded saying that \\"CNN regrets any offense her Twitter message caused. It did not meet CNN‚Äôs editorial standards.\\" The following day, on July 7, an internal CNN memo announcing Nasr's departure, CNN International‚Äôs senior vice president for newsgathering, Parisa Khosravi, wrote, \\"We believe that her credibility in her position as senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs has been compromised going forward.\\" On the Huffington Post, columnist Magda Abu-Fadil wrote about coordinated online efforts to protest Nasr's comments and push for her dismissal. In a 2012 interview, Nasr noted, \\"Without an upfront commitment from the employer to stand by and protect employees from astroturfing and negative publicity, my advice to employees is not to use social media on behalf of their employer, period.\\" =Reaction= Articles and commentaries following Nasr's sacking have been divided. Thomas Friedman was also among the many who were troubled by the decision, saying that the decision undermined the network's credibility and sent the wrong signal to young people entering journalism. He wrote \\"I find Nasr's firing troubling.\\" He questioned CNN's reaction by asking, \\"To begin with, what has gotten into us? One misplaced verb now and within hours you can have a digital lynch mob chasing after you‚Äîand your bosses scrambling for cover\\".Friedman, Thomas Can We Talk? The New York Times, 17 July 2010 In response, Mediaite's Dan Abrams asked \\"Can you imagine what would happen to a U.S. journalist expressing admiration for an Al Qaeda leader who had other, better, attributes?\\"http://www.mediaite.com/online/dan-abrams-takes-on-tom- friedman-over-octavia-nasrs-firing/ Glen Greenwald in Salon.com wrote, \\"That message spawned an intense fit of protest from Far Right outlets, Thought Crime enforcers, and other neocon precincts, and CNN quickly (and characteristically) capitulated to that pressure by firing her.\\" Greenwald referred to Fadlallah as \\"one of the Shiite world's most beloved religious figures\\", highlighting how the world viewed him including many in the west as shown in the Time Magazine's choice of Man of the year 2010 Fond Farewell. Others expressed concern over what they viewed as similar incidents, most notably Hearst syndicated columnist Helen Thomas retiring under criticism one month earlier. Those who agreed with CNN's decision stated that it had a right to enforce standards of objectivity in its reporting.Steve Krakauer CNN Was Right; Octavia Nasr Had To Go NPR, 9 July 2010Martin Peretz The Firing of Octavia Nasr Is No Tragedy‚Ä¶And No Assault On The Freedom Of The Press Either The New Republic, 23 July 2010 Those who supported Nasr felt her firing constituted a new trend in the political climate for journalists and journalism covering politically sensitive issues in general, and the Middle East in particular. Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach wrote \\"For people like...Nasr..., an imam like Fadlallah who wants to kill Americans and Israelis but who is unexpectedly nice to women has taken a giant leap forward from the Dark Ages, deserving respect and praise. This attitude is, of course, not only deeply amoral and patronizing nonsense but historically false.\\"Boteach, Shmuley Opinion: Why Are So Many Mourning a Terrorist? AolNews, 21 July 2010 Huffington Post article with title \\"CNN's Octavia Nasr: Another Victim of America's Thought Police\\" writes: \\"Since 9/11 America's redline has conflated terrorism and Israel's security, flattening all difference and particularity. As Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer pointed out, this has dangerous consequences for both the implementation of policy and the policing of public thought (they were called anti-Semites for this).\\" While The Guardian writes: \\"Nasr is one of the more high-profile victims of a phenomenon known as \\"twittercide\\", comparing the incident with another controversy surrounding death of Fadlallah, namely a tribute to him which came from the UK ambassador to Beirut. Expressing a contrary opinion, Robert Fisk derided CNN and its credibility over the firing, saying \\"Poor old CNN goes on getting more cowardly by the hour. That's why no one cares about it any more.\\"Fisk, Robert CNN was wrong about Ayatollah Fadlallah The Independent, 10 July 2010 See also * CNN controversies References External links * Octavia Nasr's CNN Videos * Octavia Nasr's Twitter Living people People from Beirut Greek Orthodox Christians from Lebanon Eastern Orthodox Christians from Lebanon Palestinian Christians American people of Lebanese descent Middle Eastern Christians Lebanese American University alumni Georgia State University alumni American television reporters and correspondents Lebanese women journalists Lebanese journalists CNN people Journalistic scandals American women television journalists 1966 births ","title":"Octavia Nasr"},{"id":"20670004","text":"The Dominican Republic Volleyball Federation ( or FEDOVOLI) is a non-profit organization which serves as the national governing body of volleyball in the Dominican Republic.

Toushin owns and manages the Bijou Theater in Chicago, the oldest gay adult theater and sex club in the United StatesU.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1454 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989). and www.bijouworld.com. Toushin has produced multiple underground and classic pornographic films and published several books on the matter. He has been a defendant in the United States justice system continuously from 1969 until the present; he has defended himself and his companies in twenty-one obscenity cases including two federal obscenity trials; and has suffered thirty-five personal arrests and over 200 busts to his businesses.Toushin, Steven, The Destruction of the Moral Fabric of America, (Wells Street Publishing, 2006). . Career Steven Toushin was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He left New York in 1963 at the age of 18, on his bicycle and traveled to Montreal to see Marlene Dietrich at Expo. During the next two years he traveled and worked at odd jobs digging graves, short order cook, picking potatoes, cutting pulp wood throughout New England. Steven left New England in the summer of 1968 landing in Chicago, where he got a job managing the Aardvark Theater in Pipers Alley that showed 16mm underground experimental art and documentary films. This was the beginning of his unusual career. The Aardvark's screening policy was not a successful endeavor and to sustain itself turned to screening art films that displayed nudity from time to time to turn a profit. In 1970 Toushin and partners presented at the Aardvark the first hardcore film to be released commercially in the U.S, Alex DeRenzy's \\"Pornography in Denmark\\" at that point the Aardvark became a porn theater. Later that year Toushin and his partners opened other theaters and sex clubs throughout Chicago, San Francisco, Indianapolis, East Chicago and Gary, Indiana, including the Festival Chicago, Festival Indianapolis, Termite, 3-Penny, Eden, Savages, and Bijou Theaters.Possley, Maurice (June 22, 1988). ‚ÄúTheater Owner Target of Porn Probe‚Äù, The Chicago Tribune. Of these only the Bijou remained open until late 2015. Toushin's first arrest for obscenity occurred in 1969 for screening the underground classic film Flaming Creatures by Jack Smith. Obscenity charges were brought under Illinois state law. In 1970 similar charges were brought for screening I Am Curious (Yellow) in Indianapolis, in 1973 for Deep Throat and in 1974 for Teenage Fantasies. The case resulting from the 1974 arrest was dismissed after a two-week jury trial: Toushin also defended himself in two federal obscenity suits regarding BDSM . His first federal obscenity trial occurred in 1973 for screening Ranch Slaves.Ricciardi v. Thompson, 480 F.2d. 167 (7th Cir. June 25, 1973). His last obscenity bust was in 1991 for the Film \\"More of a Man\\". In 1987, several of his Slave and Master films were indicted on federal obscenity charges in Tennessee, Utah and Nebraska as a result of Attorney General Meese's Commission on Pornography. This resulted in an extraordinary SM trial that included many well-known people from the Leather community. Steven's book, The Destruction of the Moral Fabric of America, is centered on this trial. The last police raid on his business was in 1996 and his last federal trial (second trial for tax's stemming from 1980‚Äì1982) was in 1998. Toushin has flourished longer than anyone else in the adult industry despite 35 arrests (personally), and 200 busts to his businesses that included 21 obscenity trials, five federal trials, three federal appeals (winning two) and numerous state and local trials. Toushin has been incarcerated twice (1988 and 1996) spending three years in federal prison for being in his chosen profession. Toushin is still the owner of the Bijou Theater (1970) the oldest gay theatre/sex club in the U.S., and Bijou Video a gay adult mail order company (1978). Over all his businesses have included theaters, sex clubs, gay bathhouses, massage parlors (prostitution), and adult bookstores in Chicago, San Francisco, Indianapolis, and East Chicago. Toushin made and produced both gay and straight adult films from 1971 to 1996 as well as S/M films in the 1970s and Slave & Master films in the early 1980s. With the advent of video Toushin became a major distributor of gay pornographic and S/M films until 1995. Toushin published The Bijou Video Catalog which many called the bible of gay video from 1980 to 1995. In 1987 he made a censorship commercial that was put on 70% of all sex tapes till 1993. He has written for several weekly gay magazines, and has authored four books, The Puppy Papers, Puppy's Tales, The Destruction of the Moral Fabric of America, and the Bijou Cock Coloring Book. In 1989 at the Adult Video Awards show in Las Vegas Toushin received (while he was in prison) the Reuben Sturman Award ‚ÄúFor Legal Battles on Behalf of the Adult Industry. In 2007 at the GayVN award show in San Francisco, Toushin was awarded the ‚ÄúLife Time Achievement Award‚Äù from the Gay Adult Industry. He is the 3rd person to ever receive this honor. In the June 2008 AVN (Adult Video News) magazine's 25th anniversary edition Toushin was acknowledged as one of the 25 pioneers who developed the Gay/bi Adult Film Industry. In January 2009 at the AVN award show in Las Vegas Toushin was inducted into the prestigious Founders Branch. This award recognized Toushin's (starting in 1969) contribution as a major player in developing the modern Adult Industry. In Dec 2007 Mr. Toushin was elected to the board of the Free Speech Coalition an organization that represents the Adult Industry. In January 2009 Mr. Toushin holds the distinction of being the first person to be voted off the Board of the FSC. Toushin felt the FSC did not represent the needs and interests of the current Adult Industry. So he created an outline for establishing an organization for business owners and sent out the proposal to select members of the Adult Industry. His proposal included a code of ethics, mission, vision and philosophy for establishing an organization that would best represent the interests of the modern adult industry in the U.S.. This did not sit well with the FSC. 1989 federal obscenity trial Toushin's second federal obscenity suit began in July 1988 when grand juries in Tennessee and Utah indicted him for the distribution of Erotic Hands, The Final Chapter of Mistress Ann, You Said a Mouthful, and Please Sir, films that depict extremely brutal and degrading S/M scenes. Nonetheless, Toushin argued that his BDSM films were not legally obscene. At the time of indictment, the U.S. government was conducting a third investigation in Nebraska and an indictment there followed.U.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1455 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989). All three investigations were the product of a federal program named ‚ÄúOperation PostPorn‚Äù which comprised a nationwide federal investigation spanning 9 U.S. cities and led to the indictment of 20 people and 14 corporations including Toushin and his companies.Possley, Maurice (July 2, 1988). ‚Äú20 Indicted in Mailing Pornography‚Äù, The Chicago Tribune. The U.S. government sought indictments for \\"obscenity by the standards of a local community\\" by ordering U.S. Postal Inspectors in Tennessee, Utah, and Nebraska to order catalogs and magazines from Toushin's businesses located in Chicago, IL. Tennessee District Judge John T. Nixon stated that ‚Äúthere is no established evidence that the films involved in this case have ever been sent to the jurisdiction by defendants except for those copies ordered by the Government.‚Äù Toushin asked the Tennessee court to transfer his case to Northern Illinois but Judge Nixon refused, stating that the appropriate finder of fact is a jury selected from the community in which the offense took place and that such a transfer should only be granted when there is ‚Äúintentional overreaching‚Äù by the government. Nixon found that ‚Äúalthough the Government took measures inducing the defendants to mail allegedly obscene materials to Middle Tennessee, the defendants made a deliberate decision to conduct business here [by mailing the materials].‚ÄùU.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1457 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989). (see Miller test) Toushin defended himself from federal obscenity charges by arguing that his films were ‚Äú violent‚Äù and did not appeal to a prurient, sick, shameful, morbid or unhealthy interest in sex. He brought expert witnesses to testify that average members of the BDSM community would not have a prurient interest in these films. The experts were psychotherapist Guy Baldwin, Dr. Robert Stoller, Dr. Richard Green, anthropologist Professor Gregerson, gay S/M activists Gayle Rubin, Jim Ward, Geoff Mains, Tony DeBlase, Dr. Andrew Charles, John Rowberry and Barry Douglas from GMSMA. He also argued that the material had scientific value as the films offer insight into violent psychological dispositions or an unhealthy interest in violence. Toushin's attorneys stated that the films present a problem in that they may appeal to an unhealthy interest in violence. However, to convict Toushin for distributing extremely violent films would be a misuse of obscenity law. Judge Nixon had consistently demonstrated his displeasure with the U.S. Government for ‚Äúattempt[ing] to fabricate venue.‚ÄùU.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1456 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989). Within 2 hours of the jury exiting the courtroom for deliberation, the U.S. Government approached Toushin's attorneys and offered to settle the case. Toushin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to use the U.S. mails to distribute obscene material and the U.S. government agreed to drop proceedings in Utah and Nebraska and to appoint Judge Nixon as the sentencing judge. In August 1989, Judge Nixon ordered Toushin to serve five years probation and fined Toushin's two businesses $250,000 each. The four movies at issue were never confiscated and the U.S. Government did not ask the court to enjoin against their future distribution.

Leavitt served on a commission in the early nineteenth century to settle boundary disputes between Massachusetts and Connecticut, was a director of one of Connecticut's first banks, and was a shipowner whose vessels traded throughout the Atlantic. Leavitt also kept a journal in which he noted everything from the weather to 'cures' for various ailments to the adoption of the United States Constitution.

Thanks to his increasing wealth, Leavitt built the home later known in Suffield as the Harmon House on High Street.Celebration of the Two Hundred and Fiftieth Anniversary of the Settlement of Suffield, Connecticut, Published by the Authority of the General Executive Committee, Suffield, 1921 Eventually Leavitt's business interests extended as far as Spain.One of Leavitt's trading partners was Aaron Lopez, an early Jewish merchant in Newport, Rhode Island, who was born in Portugal and maintained trading contacts there. He used the profits from his increasingly lucrative trading to join seven other prominent Connecticut men in purchasing the Western Reserve lands from the state of Connecticut, which the state had offered for sale in exchange for funds paid into the state's treasury for educational purposes. Thaddeus Leavitt Esq. and Suffield businessmen Oliver Phelps (then the largest landowner in America), Gideon Granger, Luther Loomis and Asahel Hatheway owned between them one- quarter of all the lands assigned to Connecticut in the Western Reserve.American Journal of Education (1855-1882), Vol. VI, Henry Barnard (ed.), Printed by F.

(Ellsworth's share of the Reserve alone came to over and embraced much of modern-day Cleveland). One of the first settlers of the Western Reserve was John Leavitt, brother of Thaddeus and founder of a family who went on to become prominent Ohio citizens. In 1803 Leavitt was among several Connecticut citizens chosen to resolve a dispute between the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts concerning the border between the two states.

Joshua Leavitt, born at Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1687, subsequently moved to Suffield and died there in 1732. He was the grandfather of Thaddeus Leavitt. Leavitt's appointment to the border commission flowed from his mercantile interests in the region. In 1805, he joined with several citizens of Connecticut and Massachusetts to form a company designated by the legislature as \\"The Proprietors of the Springfield Bridge\\". The corporation's aim was building a bridge over the Connecticut River linking West Springfield and Springfield, Massachusetts.Our County and Its People: A History of Hampden County, Massachusetts, Vol. I, Alfred Minot Copeland, The Century Memorial Publishing Co., 1902 Within the state of Connecticut, Leavitt's interests came to embrace the state's burgeoning development.

In its pages, Leavitt noted many of the day-to-day occurrences in Suffield, including an entry from December 1, 1802, on a cure for whooping cough; another for a cure for a spider bite; and an entry from March 1803 for \\"a Receipt [ie, instructions] for taking film off a horses eye\\".Thaddeus Leavitt Diary, Kent Memorial Library, Suffield, Conn., suffield- library.org Leavitt took note of the raising of a new Meeting house, and on February 8, 1788, he made this entry: \\"We this day have certain Inteligence from the state convention Boston Massachusetts that they have adopted the Feaderal Constitution by a Majority in favr of it of 19--passd 5th Inst.\\"Thaddeus Leavitt Diary, Suffield, Conn., 8 February 1788 (excerpt), Wisconsin State Historical Society Jane Leavitt Hunt, granddaughter of Thaddeus Leavitt.

It measures in length. It was designed by J W Wilson and constructed between 1865 and 1867. Teignmouth Pier seen from the beach History A total of 89 piers were built in England and Wales between 1814 and 1910 of which only 50 are still standing. Teignmouth Pier was built in 1865 by Joseph Wilson, an engineering consultant from London. As a boy, Wilson yearned to be an engineer, much to his father's disapproval, he had always hoped that he would follow the family tradition and take up a clerical post. After his son's initial schooling as a cleric, Joseph's father was eventually persuaded to send him, as an apprentice, to work under his cousin's tutelage in Fox and Henderson, an engineering firm. Later on in his career, he acted as an assistant engineer for the firm, on the construction of Crystal Palace, London. He had an inventive mind, and introduced many improvements to the machinery used on the construction. When he left there, he set up in partnership with his brother-in-law and opened The Oldbury Engineering Works. Then, due to ill health, he left Oldbury and set up as a Consulting Engineer in Banbury, where he and his son carried out the construction of Teignmouth Pier. Joseph Wilson died in 1898. Initially, the pier was a landing stage; its purpose was to enable steamboat passengers to get to the shore. In March 1870, a petition to wind up the Teignmouth Pier Company Limited was published in The London Gazette. The pier is constructed of cast-iron screw piles, screwed into the sand with a large hexagon on the pile. They are screwed down to the clay level. New steel piling has been driven 80ft right to bedrock. The deck is open and made up of wood from the Yellow Balou, a hard wood from Borneo. The deck was only recently renewed. During the Second World War, a 60‚Äìfoot section of deck was removed so that the Germans could not breach if they invaded England. Nearly all the piers on the East and South coasts were dealt with in the same way. Compensation was paid out for replacement of that section but many remained in that state for a considerable period. The Grand was not brought to its original width until the early 1960s.

It can be found in the aquarium trade. Description The exquisite wrasse has a dominant colour of greenish through to reddish and exhibits complex patterning of colours. The adult males are olive-green dorsally fading to white, pale blue or pink on their underparts and having an oval shaped dark spot on the caudal peduncle which has its bottom margin touching the lateral line. A blue line, which is frequently interrupted, runs from underneath the pectoral fin to the spot on the tail base, and another blue line runs from the corner of the mouth to above the eye before running along the base of the dorsal fin, a second line on the head runs from the posterior edge of the eye until it breaks up above the pectoral fin, and a third line runs from the rear of the mouth to the just above the pectoral-fin base. The base of the pectoral fin is marked with a black bar, edged with blue while the margin of that fin is red. All of the fins show variable amounts of red in their middle portions. The juveniles and smaller females are reddish with a blue-margined black oval-shaped spot on the caudal peduncle and a white spot at the tip of the snout. The colouration shown by exquisite wrasse does vary geographically. A male can attain a standard length of . Distribution The exquisite wrasse is found from the eastern coast of Africa as far south as Sodwana Bay in South Africa, east through the Indian Ocean to Australia and into the Pacific Ocean as far as east as the Tuamotus, French Polynesia. It reaches north as far as the Ryukyu Islands and south to the northern Great Barrier Reef. Habitat and biology The exquisite wrasse occurs where there is rubble or low patches of reefs where there is a strong current; it is also found on reef edges and around exposed outcrops of reef within areas of rubble. It can occur in reasonably large, mixed sex groups when feeding on zooplankton high above the seabed. The males often display to each other. It is considered that there may be some association with the mushroom Heliofungia actiniformis. They are protogynous hermaphrodites the males developing a larger size, longer more pointed fins and more colourful body pattern as the transform from females to males. Naming and taxonomy Cirrhilabrus exquisitus was formally described by the South African ichthyologist James L.B. Smith in 1957 with the type locality given as Pinda in Mozambique. This is the most widespread member of the genus Cirrhilabrus and may prove to represent a species complex.

Prior to the 1960s, Sister Annella's grave in St. Joseph, Minnesota was considered a place of pilgrimage. Early life Anna Cordelia Zervas was born in Moorhead, Minnesota.Zaczek, Alyssa. \\"Is this nun a Minnesotan saint? One man thinks so.\\", St. Cloud Times, November 22, 2017 Her father, Hubert Zervas, an immigrant from the village of Immekeppel, in the German Empire, was a butcher and ran a local meat market. Her mother, Emma (n√©e Levitre) Zervas, was born in Saint-Theodore-d'Acton, Quebec. Anna was raised in a large family which attended St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Moorhead, where her father was the choir director and a member of the Knights of Columbus. At the time, the parochial school from St. Mary's was looked after by priests and nuns of the Benedictine Order. According to Father Alfred Mayer, O.S.B., who was then Pastor of St. Mary's, > She sought only to please God and do His Holy Will in all things, and thence > labored but for God's honor and glory. ... It was during the summer vacation > of 1915 that she one day called on me and expressed to me her desire of > going to the convent at St. Joseph and becoming a sister. I told her that I > thought she had a religious vocation and advised her to carry out her holy > design. She seemed to be so convinced of her religious vocation that she > expressed no doubts or fears regarding it. After I had spoken some words of > encouragement and explained to her, in short, the excellence of the > religious state, she left happy and contented.Kritzeck, Ticket for Eternity, > p. 19. Hubert and Emma Zervas were reportedly very reluctant to part with their daughter at such a young age. Father Alfred, however, advised them, \\"Don't put anything in her way; she is not too young to give herself to God.\\" Hubert Zervas wrote several years later that he and his wife had then \\"gladly consented to give back the child to Him from Whom they had received her.\\" Kritzeck (1957), pp. 19‚Äì20. Benedictine Order St.Benedict's Monastery Anna entered Saint Benedict's Monastery as a postulant in 1915 and entered the novitiate in 1918. She would be remembered as a quiet and unassuming nun who was fond of reading The Following of Christ by Geert Groote. On June 17, 1918, she received the habit in a ceremony conducted by Bishop Joseph Francis Busch of St. Cloud, Minnesota. According to Dr. James Kritzeck, \\"This was the day which Anna had so eagerly awaited; in a simple, beautiful ceremony, she exchanged an elegant bridal gown for the severe religious habit.... Anna rushed to tell her parents her new religious name, Sister Mary Annella. Her mother remarked, not unkindly, 'But there is no Saint Annella,' to which Sister Annella, concealing her slight disappointment at this reaction to the name by which she would henceforth be known, replied, 'Then I shall have to be the first one!'\\"Kritzeck (1957), p. 30. She took her final vows in 1922 and was assigned as a music teacher and organist to St. Mary's Convent in Bismarck, North Dakota. Affliction During the summer of 1923, Zervas noticed a small reddish-brown patch on her arm which itched terribly, and her body began to swell. In April 1924, her parents were summoned to her hospital bedside. Initially, her mother didn't recognize her, and thought she gone to the wrong room. According to Sister Mary De' Pazzi Zervas, \\"Her hair was nearly all gone and her face looked terrible, blotchy.\\" After their shock wore off, her parents remained with her two days.The Apostle of Suffering: The Life and Death of Minnesota's Un-Canonized Saint, Catholic Family News, December 2008, pp. 1, 23‚Äì26. In June 1924, Sister Annella was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, where she was diagnosed with Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris. At the time, there was neither a cure nor specific treatment. According to Brendan D. King, > P.R.P., as it is known for short, is an inherited disease usually passed > down from parent to child. In the most serious cases, the skin becomes > overactive and is unable to regenerate. The blood vessels dilate, which > causes the body to hemorrhage moisture.

After her diagnosis, Sister Annella was transferred to the Worrell > Hospital, where all skin diseases were treated. She was given a great deal > of rest and fed a special diet consisting mainly of fish and vegetables. > Every one of her nurses expressed revulsion at the task of changing her > bandages and asked to be reassigned. There was little improvement, however. > Sister Annella's skin had grown so sensitive that lukewarm water seemed > scalding hot. By the beginning of June, a grayish purple coloring began > spreading outward from her face. Even hot packs could not stop her teeth > from chattering. With the period of examination over, Sister Annella was > transferred to St. Raphael's Hospital in St. Cloud.Catholic Family News, > December 2008, pp. 1, 23‚Äì24. Dermatologist Dr. Elizabeth Blixt, suggests that it is possible that Sister Annella's underlying illness may have led to erythroderma, a complication which could have contributed to her death. \\"Erythroderma causes the entire body to become red and inflamed, and the skin often becomes flaky. What can happen is that (the erythroderma) messes with the body's heat regulators. It can cause the body to lose a lot of heat, which makes you more susceptible to infections. It can also cause electrolyte imbalances that can lead to other things, like heart arrhythmia.\\" During the worst fits of pain, Sister Annella would repeat, \\"Yes, Lord, send me more pain, but give me strength to bear it.\\"Kreuter, \\"An Apostle of Suffering in Our Day,\\" page 7.Kritzeck, p. 87. Decline and death In the summer of 1924, Hubert and Emma Zervas paid a visit to Mother Louise Walz, O.S.B., the abbess of St. Benedict's. When it became apparent that her condition was terminal, Annella was taken home to Morehead. The abbess was kept apprised of Annella's condition and the nuns of Moorhead visited regularly. In the fall of 1924, careful dieting and osteopathic treatments brought about a remission of Sister Annella's symptoms. Her family was certain that it was only a matter of time before Sister Annella experienced a complete cure. Sister Annella, however, was unconvinced. She told her mother, \\"When this disease leaves me, God will have taken it away and he will not want me to have it anymore. I do not want anything but what God wills.\\"Kritzeck (1957), p. 65. Sister Annella also said, \\"What He has in store for me, I do not know, but all He does is well, so there is no need to worry. God has given me the grace to be resigned, and I thank him heartily for this, but also for all else He has given me with my illness.... I often wonder what great harm of body or of soul I may have suffered had not God given me this 'blessing in disguise'.\\"Kritzeck (1957), p. 70. In the summer of 1926, Sister Annella was attacked by a fit of pain immediately after leaving the confessional. Over the days that followed, the disease and its symptoms returned full force. As a novena was offered for her at Our Lady of Victory Basilica in Lackawanna, New York, her condition seemed to enter its final phase. Death occurred at 3:15 a.m. on the Vigil of the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saturday, August 14, 1926.Kritzeck (1957), p. 96. After a Roman Catholic requiem mass at her parents' parish church in Moorhead, Sister Annella's remains were transported to St. Benedict's and buried in the convent's cemetery. Legacy According to a 1989 newspaper article, within seven months of her burial at St. Benedict's Convent, Bishop Joseph Busch was hearing rumors of cures and favors granted through Sister Annella's intercession. He asked Father Alexius Hoffmann, O.S.B., St. John's Abbey, to collect information on \\"the circumstances of her sickness and death and the origin and progress of the cultus, if any, in her regard and any evidences there may be of miraculous intervention through her intercession.\\"\\"Sister Annella: The Closest We've Come to Having a Saint\\", Saint Cloud Visitor, February 9, 1989, p. 18. In April 1927, Father Alexius reported to Bishop Busch that five cures had been reported. He also submitted a biographical sketch written by Sister Annella's parents. While there is no evidence that Bishop Busch took further steps in the case, devotion to Sister Annella spread through the efforts of her father and a priest from St. John's Abbey, Father Joseph Kreuter, O.S.B. who wrote a short sketch of Sister Annella's life entitled An Apostle of Suffering in Our Day.\\" This account first appeared in the Josephinum Weekly, published at that time in Columbus, Ohio, and reprinted in other Cather publications. In 1931, it was re-issued as booklet and subsequently printed in a number of translations. A second edition of the English booklet, published by Saint John's Abbey Press, followed in 1946.Kritzeck (1957), pp. 101‚Äì02. Writing in 1957, Dr. James Kritzeck declared, \\"Whatever may happen, everyone can pray to her and have confidence in her intercession.\\"Kritzeck (1957), p. 105. According to the Visitor, the official newspaper of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Cloud: \\"While the St. Paul Daily News exaggerated when it reported that \\"thousands\\" were visiting her grave, there were some pilgrims to the convent cemetery, and many of them took a handful of dirt from Sister Annella's grave for a souvenir. Interest in Sister Annella dwindled during the 1960s, but she still has some fans. At least one of them, no one seems to know who, puts flowers on her grave regularly.St. Cloud Visitor, February 9, 1989, p. 18. In a 2008 interview with \\"The Record,\\" a newspaper published by the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University, local historian Sister Owen Lindblad, O.S.B., alleged that sightings of Sister Annella were often reported near the convent cemetery by St. Benedict's students in need of \\"a shoulder to cry on or a little advice\\".Saint John's University Record, October 31, 2008. A spokesperson for the Diocese of St. Cloud indicated that as of 2017, a cause for the canonization of Sister Annella had not been opened, nor was one anticipated. While the Benedictine sisters have complied with requests for relics, and memorial cards, it is not the policy of the Benedictines to promote canonization procedures for one of their members.\\"Sister Annella: The Closest We've Come to Having a Saint\\", Saint Cloud Visitor, February 9, 1989, p. 18. According to Sister Karen Rose OSB, while the Benedictine Sisters are not against canonizations, \\"Under the Rule of St. Benedict, humility is a very central concept,... The idea of promoting one of our own is really kind of alien to us.\\" References =Bibliography= * King, Brendan D., \\"The Apostle of Suffering: The Life and Death of Minnesota's Un-Canonized Saint,\\" Catholic Family News, December 2008, pp. 1, 23‚Äì26. * Kreuter, O.S.B., Very Reverend Joseph, \\"Sister M.

The misnomer ‚ÄúThe Cave of the Glowing Skulls‚Äù was given to the cave because of the way that light reflects off of the calcite deposits found on the skeletal remains found there. The site has gained the interest of archaeologists studying cave burials of Central America and of Mesoamerica as one of the most extensive Early to Middle Pre-Classic (~1000-900 BC in this case) ossuary cave sites currently known to have been in contact with the Maya societies of nearby Mesoamerica. It provides many valuable clues to how the inhabitants of the Talgua Cave may have been an important link between Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and parts further south and east in Central America and extending into those societies in northern South America, a region known as the Isthmo-Colombian Area. Modern discovery For generations, residents of the nearby areas had known of and visited the cave. The ossuary chamber, however, remained undiscovered until April, 1994. Two United States Peace Corps volunteers, Greg Cabe and Tim Berg and three Hondurans, Jorge Y√°√±ez and Desiderio Reyes, and Mariano Rodriguez were exploring the cave on the east bank of the Talgua River, about four miles from the city of Catacamas, when they first saw human skeletal remains about 2,000 feet inside the cave. Mr. Berg and Mr. Cabe reported their find to Honduran and American archaeologists. After the initial discovery of the remains, James Brady, professor of anthropology at California State University, Los Angeles and George Hasemann, head of the archaeology section of Instituto Hondure√±o de Antropolog√≠a e Historia in Tegucigalpa began investigating the historical implications of the site related to the inhabitants of this region and ancient northeastern Honduras cave burials. The Instituto Hondure√±o de Antropolog√≠a e Historia supervised and authorized all archaeological exploration and protection of the cave.Brady, James E. Am√©ricas. Issue 4, Vol. 47. pp. 6-12 Archaeological investigations Traditionally, the majority of the archaeological focus in Honduras has been in the Maya ruins of Cop√°n, the pinnacle of which is normally associated with the Maya Classic period (~200-900 CE). The recent discovery of the Talgua funerary site has been dated using radiocarbon dating to the Early to Middle Pre-Classic period (~1000 BCE). This type of burial site is normally seen as corresponding to some advancing form of social complexity, which greatly increases the site‚Äôs appeal to those interested in the study of societal development in Pre-Columbian Central and Mesoamerica and those societies interacting with the Maya. During the initial investigation following the discovery of the main ossuary chamber within the cave, another tunnel containing three passageways was found. Within the primary ossuary chamber and the three additional passageways, 23 deposits containing human skeletal remains were discovered, at least 20 of which contained the remains of more than one person. All remains were described as appearing to be secondary burials that were moved from their initial burial sites. The bones were most likely packaged in cloth material and carried into the cave through an old entrance no longer available. Further analysis indicated that the flesh had been removed and the bones were placed in small bundles before arrival to the cave. All of the bones were painted with a red pigment (determined through x-ray diffraction to be red ocher with numerous iron oxides and including hematite). The pigment was also splattered on the ground and walls surrounding the cave, which appears to be due to its rapid and liberal application. All skeletal remains were preserved in and cemented to the ground by calcite. The water level within the cave made the remains found to be in two different contexts. Natural deterioration due to dripping and damage from vandalism had affected greatly those burials found on ledges and above the water level. However, all of the offerings found in the cave are associated with the burials found above the water line. Burials below the water line were found to be within relatively deep (~ 3 feet) rimstone dams. In addition to the human skeletal remains, there were at least 20 intact and restorable ceramic vessels found in the cave. At least one of the vessels was ‚Äúceremonially killed‚Äù by having had a hole punched in the bottom of it. Many of the vessels were positioned in a manner resembling several cave burials at the site of Cop√°n. The investigators of the site, however, have found evidence in further social stratification in the relationships of the vessels to the human remains. Identity of site's occupants Determining the identity and languages of the people whose remains are located in the Talgua Cave has been a complicated and difficult endeavor because Rio Talgua, described during the period following the Spanish Conquest, fell on the border of a number of ethnic groups. A Spanish missionary named Father Fernando Espino described the Olancho Valley to be an area containing ‚Äúmore than two-hundred different nations and languages‚Äù in 1674. Although there are numerous links between the people of Talgua and the Maya cultures, the site is definitively and categorically not a Mayan site due to location and spoken language. Two of the most likely candidates for the lineage of the people at Talgua are the Lenca people and the Pech People (Paya). The Lenca people are generally considered to be Mesoamerican and are now spread among the following western Honduran Municipalities: La Paz Department, Comayagua Department, Intibuc√° Department, Lempira Department and Santa B√°rbara Department. Although, evidence of Pre- Columbian Lencan culture can be traced to the Olancho Valley (Salinas). Pech people, who speak a variation of the Chibchan languages of South America, can still be found in the Olancho Department in the area surrounding the site and along the Rio Talgua, as well as in the Col√≥n Department.Salinas, Iris Milady (1991). Arquitectura de los Grupos √âtnicos de Honduras. Tegucigalpa. Editorial Guaymuras S.A. p. 41; p. 81 Other candidates for descendants include the Tawahka and the Tol people Despite the difficulty of determining for certain the exact identity of the inhabitants of Talgua, many aspects of their society can be determined with some certainty. Based on finds at the Talgua Cave and at the Talgua Village Site, a definite affiliation with Mesoamerica and the Maya living in the area of Cop√°n has been determined. The people at Talgua were linked in trade with the Maya and, reflected in many of the objects and architecture of the Talgua area, had many similarities to the Maya of the period. In the words of one of the principal investigators of the site, James E. Brady: \\"To put the Talgua site into Maya perspective, the Talgua people may have been interacting with the Maya and had developed a level of civilization equal to any society known in the Maya area at that time.\\" A surprising find relating to analysis of the bone protein stable isotopes is that the people buried in the cave did not eat an abundance of maize, the cultivation of which is normally seen as corresponding to advancements in social complexity and stratification within Pre-Columbian societies of Mesoamerica and surrounding areas. Instead, researchers suspect that manioc, or cassava root may have been the society‚Äôs primary means of subsistence. Talgua village site Along an ancient terrace on the west bank of the Rio Talgua, within a half mile of the cave entrance, a settlement has been unearthed that has since been determined to be the largest site in the country of Honduras from the period. The site extends for over a third of a mile and contains at least 100 standing structures. Many aspects of the settlement (i.e., size, shape, distribution, central plazas, etc.) resemble those of many sites in southeastern Mesoamerica. Ceramics collected at the settlement were similar to those found at the ossuary, which links the settlement area to the ossuary as the probable area of primary habitation for those people found buried in the Talgua Cave. Ceramics from other sites in Honduras were of very little help in determining the chronology of the Talgua site because the northeast region of Honduras developed independently of other regions throughout the majority of its prehistory.Pottery of Prehistoric Honduras, edited by J. Henderson and M. Beaudry-Corbett, pp. 257-280. UCLA Institute for Archaeology Monograph 35. University of California, Los Angeles. p. 16 Trade networks Architectural patterns and objects found at the Talgua settlement provide indicators of both social stratification and trade networks with the Maya. Jade and marble vessels found at the site are seen as items of prestige and clues to the degree of social stratification. In addition to the prestige items found, there were numerous items made of obsidian, which would have come from the Maya highland regions and jade from Maya areas of Guatemala. Whereas, items found to be made out of green, jade-like rocks indigenous to northeast Honduras were found not to be Jade at all, but jadeites or green rocks with a distinct talc feel (Cuddy 122). In further exemplification of the role of this area as an important buffer zone between Mesoamerica and southern Central and South America, Doris Stone (1966)Stone, Doris and Carlos Balser. (1965). ‚ÄúIncised Stone Disks from the Atlantic Watershed of Costa Rica‚Äù in American Antiquity 30(3): 310-329. has pointed out that much of the area‚Äôs later fascination with gold came from the south and fascination with jade came from the Maya in the north. Items and beads of greenstone were in full production by around 500 CE. The Cuyamel ceramics found in northeastern Honduras are contemporaneous with the Olmec rise in the Middle Pre-classic period. It has not been definitively determined that Olmec art and culture would have spread to northeastern Honduras during this time period. However, the ceramics are thought to have stylistic similarities to other Pre-Classic Mesoamerican ceramics and the presence of Olmec imagery is documented at Early Pre-Classic villages in northeastern, coastal Honduras, such as Puerto Escondido.Joyce, Rosemary A. (1993) ‚ÄúA Key to Ul√∫a Polychromes‚Äù in Pottery of Prehistoric Honduras, edited by J. Henderson and M. Beaudry-Corbett, pp. 257-280. UCLA Institute for Archaeology Monograph 35. University of California, Los Angeles. Although not much can be said definitively about trade with Maya during the Early to Middle Pre-Classic, other than that it occurred, there are other, better-documented cases of Maya trade with northeastern Honduras during later periods. For example, the site of Naco was involved in steady trade with Maya areas of the Yucat√°n and may have been an intermediary trade location between the Maya and other cultures of Central America just prior to arrival of the Spaniards.Cuddy, Thomas W. (2007). Political Identity and Archaeology in Northeast Honduras. Boulder, Colorado. The University Press of Colorado. Visiting the Cave A small piece of the Talgua Cave can be toured by the public. Travel to Catacamas, Olancho and continue on toward the caves, there are high quality roads and bridges that allow access to the cave. A well developed and secure walking trail has been constructed of cement and iron from the road up to the cave entrance. In 1995 access included an oxcart trail followed by arduous trekking through the jungle, and fording the Talgua River. The park entrance charges a nominal fee of approximately $1(US) to Hondurans, and $20(US) to foreigners. A guide is required for tours of the cave for a negotiable fee. THE MODERN CAVE: Your guide will instruct you to remain on the system of narrow elevated walkways that exist throughout the cave, and to be careful not to touch the delicate walls. Visitors barely set foot on the cave floor. The vast majority of the cave, including the ossuary, is off limits to public access. Public access is limited to about 500 meters, readers will note that discoverer accounts show that the ossuary is located about 1,000 meters within the cave. Nothing can be seen of significance within the cave, all cave formations including all but a few stalagmites high up in the ceiling were destroyed and removed by locals long before the discovery of the ossuary. Few caves show the level of destruction that exists in this cave, and it is doubtful that anyone not using powered machinery could do any noticeable further degradation to the accessible portion of the cave. At the furthest allowed penetration into the cave you will arrive at a heavy barred doorway placed to protect against entry after the cave was thoroughly looted in 1994-1995. Nothing can be seen at this point, and your guide will tell you that this is the entry to the ossuary that lies just beyond. The true ossuary entrance lies some hundreds of yards - roughly double the distance into the cave that visitors are allowed to enter- beyond the barred door. The cave itself continues well beyond for roughly a mile into the mountain with several branches. About 2,000 feet beyond the barred door destruction of the cave interior dramatically decreases and a beautiful natural cave can be seen. Deep within the cave hundreds of crawl holes, many of which are impassable in wet season, were possible to explore in the days before The Door.

The original collection was published in 1937 and included 21 essays mainly written between 1928 and 1931. Four were added to the book in the 1939 edition, about Lord Fisher, Charles Stewart Parnell, Lord Baden-Powell and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1941 the essays on Boris Savinkov and Leon Trotsky were removed from editions published at that time, since they had been opponents of Joseph Stalin, who as leader of Russia was now officially an ally of Britain against Germany in World War II, and the article on Roosevelt was removed in 1942 when America also became officially an ally of Britain with Roosevelt as president. The Odhams edition of 1947 reinstated the three essays after the war. Other subjects of the essays were Earl of Rosebery, Kaiser Wilhelm II, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Chamberlain, Sir John French, John Morley, Hindenburg, H. H.
