Jemsatjee Bomanjee built the Marquis Cornwallis of teak for the Honourable East India Company (EIC) between 1800 and 1801. In March 1805 Admiral Sir Edward Pellew purchased her from the Company shortly after she returned from a voyage to Britain. She served in the Far East, sailing to Australia and the Pacific Coast of South America before returning to India. In February 1811 the Admiralty renamed her HMS Akbar. She captured forts and vessels in the Celebes and Amboyna, and participated in the invasion of Isle de France, and the 1811 invasion of Java. She also served in the West Indies before being laid up at Portsmouth in December 1816. She then stayed in Britain in a number of stationary medical and training capacities until the Admiralty sold her in the 1860s. Service with the EIC The EIC had Marquis Cornwallis built for long-range convoy escort duties. As such, she was a spar-decked frigate. As of 1 January 1802 she was under the command of Captain Thomas Hardie. In December 1801, she sailed, together with (a country ship), Betsey (an armed HEIC brig), some other vessels, and 1000 troops to Daman and Diu to persuade the Portuguese governor to resist any French incursion. The expedition was under the command of Captain John Mackellar, of the Royal Navy, whose own vessel, , was not ready for sea.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, Part 1, p.219. The governor accepted the British reinforcements, which, as it turned out, were not needed. Marquis Cornwallis, under the command of Captain Isaac Godsalve Richardson, left Bombay on 7 Feb 1803, reaching St Helena on 12 May, and arriving at the Downs on 1 August. On 8 May 1804, Marquis Cornwallis sailed from Portsmouth, still under Richardson's command. She sailed via St Helena to Bombay, where the company intended for her to remain. She was convoying Marquis of Ely, Marchioness of Exeter, Lord Nelson, Brunswick, Princess Charlotte, Marquis of Wellesley, and Ann. Royal Navy service In 1805 Admiral Pellew purchased her for ¬£68,630, and commissioned her \\"immediately\\". Commander Charles James Johnston took command in February 1806. She then served off Bombay and engaged in the long-distance blockade of Isle de France (now Mauritius). On 11 November 1806, and Cornwallis sailed into Saint Paul's Bay, on √éle Bonaparte, in an attempt to cut out vessels there, which consisted of the French frigate S√©millante, three other armed ships and twelve captured British ships. (The eight ships that were prizes to S√©millante had a collective value of ¬£1.5 million.) Sceptre and Cornwallis fired on the French and took fire in return. However, when the slight breeze failed, Sceptre and Cornwallis found themselves unable to maneuver. They therefore left without having accomplished anything, but apparently also without having suffered damage or losses.James (1837), Vol. 5, p.65. =Pacific cruise= In February 1807, Cornwallis, under the command of Johnston, was ordered on a cruise against Spanish shipping and ports on the west coast of South America. Johnston used Port Jackson as a base for refreshment and re-supply before proceeding on his cruise between May and October 1807. Cornwallis sailed first to Juan Fernandez, then cruised northward along the coasts of Chile, Peru, Panama, and Mexico, capturing 17 vessels, most of them small, two of which were sent as prizes to Port Jackson.Charles James Johnston, Captain, \\"Log of the Proceedings of His Majesty‚Äôs Ship the Cornwallis, 1807\\", National Archives, Kew, ADM 51/1777; The Sydney Gazette, 19 April and 7 June 1807, 15 May 1808. One of them, the re- captured South Sea whaler Atlantic, was found to be too unseaworthy for a Pacific crossing; her captors scuttled her off Punta Mala (Panama) on 7 September. The brig Rosal√≠a, of 375 tons, was captured at the Peruvian port of Ilo on 13 July. Cornwallis took her to Pisco with other prizes, and then dispatched her to Port Jackson on 17 July with seven men on board under the command of Lieutenant John Garland, Cornwalliss master. Rosal√≠a was wrecked on the Minerva Reefs, 1,300 kilometres from Norfolk Island. The survivors then sailed to Norfolk Island without chart or quadrant. This was a feat of navigation that ranked with that of William Bligh from Tofua to Kupang in ‚Äôs launch in 1789, or that of William and Mary Bryant and their companions from Port Jackson to Kupang in a cutter in 1792.King, December 2017/January 2018, pp.11-15. The Calcutta Gazette of 25 February 1808 reported the presence of the Cornwallis at Malacca the previous month, and said that: > Captain Johnson [sic] was returned from a cruize of upwards of nine months, > during which time he had proceeded along the coast of South America; had > been at New Holland, Owyhee and other islands in the South Sea. He had > destroyed near 30 vessels, and had captured three, which he left at Port > Jackson. The cruise is commemorated in the name Johnston Atoll, which atoll Captain Johnston sighted on 15 December 1807 while proceeding on his course from Hawaii to Canton. Also, Port Pegasus on Stewart Island and Pegasus Bay on the Banks Peninsula are named for the captured ship Pegaso, re-named Pegasus after being sent to Port Jackson and sold as a prize.Her new owners then employed Pegasus in seal hunting on the coasts of New Zealand. =East Indies= In 1808, command of Cornwallis passed to Captain Fleetwood Pellew. Cornwallis, in company with Sceptre, engaged and damaged S√©millante, together with the shore batteries whose protection she had sought. In 1809 Captain Christopher Cole took command. When he moved to , William Augustus Montagu replaced him. Montagu then engaged in a number of operations in the Dutch East Indies, attacking forts on islands in the Celebes and Amboyna. On 17 January, Montagu and Cornwallis attacked a Dutch fort at Boolo Combo in Bouthian Bay in the Celebes. Montagu, under a flag of truce, had requested permission to water his ship. When the Dutch commander refused, the British landed a small force of 100 men from the European Madras regiment. The 30 or so Dutch troops and 200 local troops quickly gave up the fort, but continued to snipe from the woods. The British burnt 11 small vessels (20-50 tons each), and the public buildings, took the ammunition, and spiked the eight 9-pounder guns and two brass field pieces there. The action cost the British one man killed, and nine wounded, including the captain commanding the landing force, who was lightly wounded. On 1 February Montagu spied a brig taking shelter under the guns of Manippa. He sent in three boats which brought the brig out. The British suffered no casualties despite coming under heavy small arms fire from the fort. Montagu took the cargo of foodstuffs off the brig to feed his crew, and then burnt the vessel. There were no British casualties In February 1810, the British attacked Amboyna. In the campaign, Cornwallis captured the ship Mandarine, of 16 guns and 66 men, Captain Besman, on 3 February after a chase of four hours. Madarine had been out for four weeks but had captured nothing. Cornwallis suffered only one man wounded in the action. Mandarine then served as a tender to Cornwallis.Mandarine is not , which the British also captured during the same campaign. On 1 March Cornwallis chased a Dutch man-of-war brig all day until she took refuge in a small bay on the north side of the island of Amblaw. The wind being light and variable, and night approaching, Montagu sent in Cornwalliss boats, under the command of Lieutenant Henry John Peachy. After rowing all night, they captured the Dutch brig Margaritta Louisa, under Captain De Ruyter on 2 March. Margaritta Louisa was pierced for 14 guns but carried only eight, and a crew of 40 men. Margaritta Louisa had left Surabaya nine days earlier with 20 to 30,000 dollars for Ambonya, and supplies for Ternate. In the boarding, the British had one man seriously wounded and four men lightly wounded; the Dutch lost one man killed and 20 wounded. Cornwallis, Dover, and Samarang in January 1816 shared in the prize money awarded for sundry property captured on and off Ambonya between 19 February 1810 and 21 March. Cornwallis and Dover also shared in Samarangs capture on 28 March of the Dutch brig Recruiter. In late 1810, Cornwallis was deployed with Albemarle Bertie's squadron that forced the surrender of Isle de France. William Fisher took command in December 1810 after Montagu was selected from among the captains assembled for the invasion and reassigned to lead a naval brigade in support of the British Army forces' ground offensive. In February 1811, Cornwallis was renamed HMS Akbar, freeing the name for the 3rd-rate ship of the line HMS Cornwallis that was launched in Bombay in 1813. On 29 June 1811 captured the slaver Expedition off Mauritius. The prize crew took the ship and the slaves on her to the Portuguese colony of Goa because selling slaves was illegal in British India, but not Goa. Salsette shared the prize money with the crews of and Cornwallis.History 1793-1844 from the newspapers Between 4 August and 19 September 1811, Akbar participated in the capture of Java. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Java\\" to all surviving claimants from the campaign. =United Kingdom= Frigate Akhbar as a reformatory, 1859 Akbar was paid-off in July 1812. Then in February 1813 she was at Woolwich Dockyard for conversion to a store ship. In the spring of 1813, Captain Archibald Dickson was appointed to command Akbar.Royal Naval Biography Vol IV part II p.447. Between March and December she was converted to a frigate. However, in late August she escorted Windham, , and out of the Channel as they left Britain with convicts for New South Wales. On 15 May 1814, Akbar recaptured Indian Lass. Captain Charles Bullen took command in November 1814. Rear-Admiral Griffiths made her his flagship on the Bermuda station in 1815. The court martial of captain, officers and men of for the loss of their vessel took place on board Akbar at Halifax on 28 June 1815. Then on 11 August Akbar and captured Hannah. Fate Akbar was laid up at Portsmouth in December 1816, but the next year was fitted as a troopship. Then between June and December 1824 she was fitted to serve as a quarantine ship for Pembroke. In September 1827 she was moved to Liverpool to serve as a lazaretto. She became a training ship in 1852 and a quarantine ship again around 1858. She was sold in 1862 for breaking up.

The Molucca Sea Plate represents the only known example of divergent double subduction (DDS), which describes the subduction on both sides of a single oceanic plate. Molucca Sea Collision Zone modified by Zhang et al. using GeoMapApp  Tectonic setting  The Molucca Sea Plate is one of many tectonic features that compose the Molucca Sea Collision Complex, which refers to the tectonic relationship of the Sangihe Plate, Halmahera Plate, and the Molucca Sea Plate, in addition to the volcanic Halmahera and Sangihe Arcs. The southeast moving Sangihe Plate is situated along the western boundary of the Molucca Sea Plate. The northwest moving Halmahera Plate is situated along the eastern boundary of the Molucca Sea Plate. In the western Pacific Ocean, the Molucca Sea is bordered by the Indonesian Islands of Celebes (Sulawesi) to the west, Halmahera to the east, and the Sula Islands to the south. The Molucca Sea borders the Banda Sea to the south and the Celebes Sea to the west. To the north is the Philippine Sea and to the east is the Halmahera Sea. Situated south of Mindanao, the Molucca Sea is a narrow basin underlined by a north‚Äêsouth ophiolitic ridge, which uplifts the central region of the basin.  Plate mechanics  Cross Section of Molucca Sea Collision Zone modified by Zhang et al. While the scientific community has not come to a consensus as to when the Molucca Sea Plate became fully subducted, the dominant theory is that the Molucca Sea Plate has been completely subducted beneath the overriding Halmahera and Sangihe Plates. When actively subducting, the crustal collision of the Molucca Sea Plate was formed by surface intersection of ‚Äúoppositely dipping Benioff zones‚Äù (also known as divergent double subduction) which results in the Sangihe and Halmahera volcanic arcs. The force exerted by the thick overlying collision complex of the Halmahera and Sangihe Plates effectively depressed the crust of the Molucca Sea Plate. The plate itself features an asymmetrical morphology, configured in an inverted U-shape. The arc-arc collision zone of the Molucca Sea Plate is characterized as a thick, low velocity layer, which is highly variable in density. The variable in density of the Molucca Sea Plate led to different subduction velocities on the two sides. Divergent Double Subduction may facilitate various tectonic processes, including closure of ocean basins, accretion and amalgamation of volcanic arcs, and growth of continents.  Earthquakes  (Asymmetric) Divergent Double Subduction Zone modified by Zhao et al. Historically, the Molucca Sea Plate has experienced hundreds of earthquakes ranging in magnitude. The most recent large earthquake occurred on January 2017 when a 7.3 magnitude earthquake deep beneath the Celebes Sea, which the USGS attributed to the ‚Äúdeep reverse faulting within the inclined seismic zone defining the deep limit of the Molucca Sea microplate beneath the Celebes Sea Basin.‚Äù  Geology  The geologic characteristics displayed on the surrounding islands provide insight regarding the complex plate movement of the divergent double subducting plate. Detached ophiolitic series and thick melanges are overlain by forearc deposits; subduction-driven east-west shortening of the Snellius Plateau caused the thrust melanges to reactivate and deform the forearc series. Exposed ophiolitic rocks can be found on the islands of the submarine Talaud-Mayu Ridge, which bisects the arc-arc collision zone of the Molucca Sea Plate; these ophiolites provide insight regarding the relationship between earthquakes and uplift surrounding the plate.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). Page 689. McGraw-Hill. . Signs and symptoms Persistent edema of rosacea is an uncommon cutaneous condition characterized by a hard, nonpitting edema restricted to the forehead, glabella, upper eyelids, nose, and cheeks. This condition is also known as chronic upper facial erythematous edema, Morbihan's disease, morbus Morbihan, and rosaceous lymphedema. Despite the name, it is unclear whether this condition is a distinct disease or a rare complication of rosacea. Generally, there are few symptomatic complaints aside from redness and facial contour changes. The edema typically worsens slowly over months to years and is often on a background of chronic inflammation. Diagnosis There are no specific laboratory findings associated with this condition, and the histology tends to be similar to that seen in rosacea. The differential diagnosis includes acne vulgaris, streptococcal cellulitis, and Melkersson‚ÄìRosenthal syndrome, as these conditions can also rarely manifest with a similar edema, as well as other forms of rosacea, lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis. Treatment Most cases of this condition tend to be recalcitrant to treatment, with topical and oral antibiotic regimens commonly used for rosacea generally being ineffective. For the severe forms of this disease, oral isotretinoin therapy has been used, and the condition responds well to doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day. However, unlike in the treatment of acne vulgaris, lasting responses to isotretinoin generally do not occur, and long-term maintenance therapy with oral tetracyclines is usually necessary. Eyelid reduction surgery has also been reported to help with the cosmetic appearance of the condition, but does not alter the disease progression.Ajith C, et al.

It was not until the 1770s, when the British Empire came to colonize India, that the concept of law came into practice. Colonial Hindu law marks a long span of nearly 200 years, beginning in 1772 and ending in 1947. This period may be split into two main phases. The first phase (beginning in 1772 and ending in 1864) is marked by three main events: translation of the Dharma≈õƒÅstras by British scholar-administrators, the use of court pandits to define laws and rules, and the rise of case law. The second phase (from 1864 to 1947) is marked by the dismissal of court pandits, the rise of legislative processes, and a codified law system.  Pre- British India  The British had been observing the country for nearly twenty years before their first implemented legal plan for renovating India's method of governing. As Europeans began gaining power and increasing the number of territories they controlled, they gradually became acquainted with the way the different territorial systems operated. Beginning with the coastal territories and moving inland, the British accumulated more Indian states. However, they could not oppose the customs and traditions that were already in place without offending the native peoples. Because they only held a minimal amount of power to implement change and enact laws, they had to respect the wishes the natives or reach a compromise. The British had to administer law coinciding with the rule of each zamindar (hereditary leader); this meant that only customary law could be implemented at that time. There was tension between the two religious groups (Muslim and Hindu), since the sources of their rules differed greatly. The Muslims' governing body (and laws) derived from the Qur'an and books written by doctors who had studied Sharia. For the Hindu population, however, the guidelines on how to live life came from the Dharma≈õƒÅstras (Sanskrit texts describing duties). Although laws in place were text-based, there was still a great deal of variation between different regions. Customary law was the main type of government in the territories and differed greatly in defining crime, punishment, guilt, how courts were organized and so on. The British saw this system as unfair, due to the ambiguity of laws in different regions and lack of a common law. They believed this system to be dysfunctional and an invitation for corruption, due to the ability of judges to decide a case as they saw fit with no precedent. For example, two cases could have virtually- identical facts but the outcome and punishment of the two might be very different. This was not a problem in the Indian tradition, but the British proposed a plan for unifying laws.  First British law  India underwent a seismic shift in the way in which she was governed on August 21, 1772 when, in Bengal's capital city Calcutta, a new plan of governance was implemented by Warren Hastings. This marked the first step towards uniting Muslim and Hindu legal traditions. The ‚ÄúPlan for the Administration and Justice in Bengal‚Äù (more commonly known as the \\"Judicial Plan\\") laid the foundation for replacing ambiguous laws that were not formally written down into a British system, with different branches of government. Warren Hastings‚Äô Judicial Plan included a provision which left certain religious matters to traditional law. This stipulated that inheritance, marriage, caste, and other religious use or institutions should be in accordance with the Dharma≈õƒÅstras and not subject to British law.

It served primarily in the Eastern Theater in several major campaigns of the Army of the Potomac and was particularly active during the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863. Organization and early service The 6th Ohio Cavalry Regiment was commissioned for a three-year term. It was organized at Camp Hutchins in Warren, Ohio, on October 7, 1861, and first served under Colonel William R. Lloyd.Stevens, Larry, 6th Ohio Cavalry, 1995. The regiment was on duty in Warren until January 1862, and was then garrisoned at Camp Chase and Camp Dennison until May 1862. The troopers were given their horses while stationed at Camp Dennison, after which the officers led the men in mounted cavalry drills. Following completion of training, the regiment moved to Wheeling, West Virginia on May 13 and then to Strasburg, Virginia to join Major General John C. Fremont's army in the Shenandoah Valley. The regiment was attached to the Mountain Department until June 1862 and participated in several engagements with the Confederates, first seeing combat at the Battle of Woodstock on June 2. Other battles during this period included Cross Keys and Cedar Mountain. In late June, the regiment moved to the Virginia Peninsula and became part of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 1st Corps, Pope's Army of Virginia until July 1862. The regiment saw considerable action during the Northern Virginia Campaign in the late summer, and was engaged in skirmishing during the Second Bull Run operations. As part of the Army of the Potomac, the 6th Ohio Cavalry participated in the Fredericksburg operations in November‚ÄìDecember 1862. It subsequently went into winter quarters, guarding the Rappahannock River. 1863 and 1864 In 1863, the regiment participated in the Battle of Kelly's Ford. Later that year, it was heavily involved in the Gettysburg Campaign, fighting at the Battle of Brandy Station and in several smaller engagements during the Union operations in the Loudoun Valley of Virginia, including the battles of Aldie, Middleburg, and Upperville. They traveled into Pennsylvania with the division as part of the brigade of Col. Pennock Huey, but before the Battle of Gettysburg withdrew to Westminster, Maryland, to guard the army's supply trains. The regiment was active during the retreat of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in July. Later in the year, the regiment participated in both the Mine Run and Bristoe campaigns. After spending the winter fighting Mosby's guerillas, in the spring of 1864 the regiment joined Ulysses S. Grant's movement on Richmond, participating in several battles while serving in the Cavalry Corps, under Gen. Philip H. Sheridan. It was involved in the Union cavalry operations during the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg, as well as taking part in the Battle of Trevillian Station. 1865 and the end of the war In 1865, the regiment was in the Battle of Five Forks, and during the Appomattox Campaign, in the Battle of Sayler's Creek. The 6th Ohio Cavalry marched in the Grand Review of the Armies in May 1865, and then exited service at Petersburg, Virginia, on August 7, 1865. During its term of service, the 6th Ohio Cavalry lost 5 officers and 52 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 4 officers and 177 enlisted men by disease, for a total of 238 fatalities. More than 1700 men served in the ranks at various times, however, the field strength of the regiment rarely exceeded 500 men at any given time. A stone monument to the regiment stands along Taneytown Road on the Gettysburg Battlefield, which features a relief of a saber-wielding cavalryman mounted on his horse at full gallop.

In Chinese he is known as Fan Fenglong () or simply Doctor Fan (). Life and work Jane≈æ was born on January 14, 1913 in Dolsko near Ljubljana, Slovenia. His parents Ana and Franc Jane≈æ had three other sons (Franc Jr., Karel, and Viktor) and one daughter (Mimi). After graduating from a classical secondary school, his mother encouraged him to study theology. However, Jane≈æ decided to study medicine in Ljubljana, Zagreb, and Graz. He received his doctorate on May 28, 1937. Later he continued specialized studies in Belgrade and Vienna. He began working as a surgeon at the Ljubljana hospital in 1937. He continued to work as physician and surgeon during World War II. During the war he was neither militarily nor politically active. He did not collaborate with the German or Italian forces, but after the war Yugoslav communist authorities accused him of collaborationism and put him on a death-sentence list. To save his life, he fled to a refugee camp in Carinthia, Austria. This camp was under British military command. When Yugoslavia demanded the repatriation of these refugees, British soldiers loaded them on a train, saying that they were going to Italy. However, Jane≈æ suspected that they were going in wrong direction and he fled again. Most of the people on the train were murdered without trial at Koƒçevje Rog and several other locations in Slovenia. Jane≈æ spent a while hiding in Austria. In 1947 he went to Rome, Italy. There he met Ladislav Lenƒçek, a lazarist who proposed that he go to China and help Italian missionaries as a physician. Jane≈æ decided to become a lay missionary‚Äîa Christian missionary who has not received Holy Orders, but dedicates his life in serving other people and giving them a good example of Christian love and virtues. Soon he left Italy, and after a brief stop in 1948 in Buenos Aires, Argentina he came to China. In mainland China he worked as a medical doctor in Zhaotong (Êò≠ÈÄö, WG: Chaot'ung), Yunnan. The hospital in Zhaotong was supervised by Camillian monks from Italy and nuns from Slovenia. On his arrival, the hospital was in quite poor condition. It lacked modern equipment and the staff was not suitably qualified. Jane≈æ organized educational training of the staff and bought some modern equipment (thanks to donations made by sponsors from abroad): an X-ray machine and surgical instruments. Soon the hospital experienced a real boom and the fame of the miraculous doctor who could cure any illness began to spread among the neighboring population. During this period Jane≈æ realized that he would not be able to establish sincere contact with his patients without knowledge of the language, and so he began learning Chinese. In 1952 the Chinese communist authorities arrested the entire hospital staff. Along with some colleagues, Jane≈æ was sentenced to death but later his sentence was changed to expulsion from the country. He moved to Taiwan, to the town of Luodong in Yilan County. He intentionally chose this small and undeveloped town because he saw that the people living there had greater need of his medical help. The situation in the city was desperate. Taiwan had accepted many refugees from the mainland, and the people were afflicted by poverty and diseases caused by lack of hygiene. There was no hospital. The Camilian monks established a small outpatient clinic that over the years evolved into a modern hospital, now known as St. Mary's Hospital. In this hospital Jane≈æ lived and worked for the next 38 years. He worked from dawn to late evening, and he often performed 10 or more difficult operations in one day. During all this time he refused wages; he requested only a small apartment, food, and a little pocket money. He died on October 11, 1990. He was buried on October 19 in Luodong. On the day of his burial, an enormous crowd came to Luodong to honor the memory of this great man whose entire life was a sacrifice to simple people in need. He was awarded Order of St. Sylvester and Order of St. Gregory the Great. The Taiwanese authorities awarded him the \\"Good Man\\" medal.

Wow! Wubbzy! project not to air on Nick Jr., as of Starz producing the series. A sequel, Wubb Idol, premiered on Nick Jr. on May 1, 2009. Summary When Wubbzy loses his memory, it's up to his friends to help him get it back. Plot Wubbzy, Widget and Walden are going to get some doodleberry pie, but Wubbzy ends up tripping over a rock, smashes his head down a hill and ends up getting Knockity-Noggin and being unable to remember who he is. Widget and Walden try help Wubbzy recover his memory, but fail miserably. Previously aired episodes from the TV series are used for flashbacks when one of the characters recalls a moment to help Wubbzy remember. The episodes included: \\"Puddle Muddle\\", \\"The Tired Tail\\", \\"Pirate Treasure\\", \\"Come Spy with Me\\", \\"A Tale of Tails\\", \\"Perfecto Party\\", and \\"Monster Madness\\". There are also references from \\"Wubbzy in the Woods\\" and \\"Escape from Dino Island\\". In continuity sense, the film takes place right after the events of \\"Puddle Muddle\\" and a week after the events of \\"The Tired Tail\\" which he hurts his tail last week as said by Dr. Flooey. The film nearly ends when Wubbzy still cannot remember anything, so Widget ejects him off the chair, sending him flying. He begins falling down a hill, while his head gets continually smashed by the force, eventually landing on his bottom. Widget asks Wubbzy if he is okay, Wubbzy replies back to Widget: \\"Yeah, I'm fine! Come on, let's go get that doodleberry pie!\\". Walden then asks Wubbzy if he remembers doodleberry pie, then he replies: \\"Sure, I love doodleberry pie!\\" Then Widget asks Wubbzy if he remembers Widget and Walden, Wubbzy then replies: \\"Of course, you guys are the best friends ever, I never forget you!\\". Walden then concludes to Wubbzy and Widget that Wubbzy has his memory recovered and that he is back to normal. Then, Widget and Walden then go get some doodleberry pie with Wubbzy, when all of a sudden Wubbzy ends up mooing for one last time, which of course he implies he was kidding. Wubbzy, Widget and Walden end up laughing about it, and the film ends.

Edna O'Brien makes a cameo appearance as an extra in a church, her first return to such a building after having her work The Country Girls subject to religious condemnation by the Catholic authorities. She was the subject of book burning rites and was threatened with excommunication in the 1960s. Clare Alan said: Her parents were said to have become ashamed of her for invoking the controversy and, despite O'Brien dedicating the book to her mother, she seemed the most upset. After her mother's death, O'Brien discovered a hidden copy of The Country Girls in an outhouse near her family home; the book had been thoroughly censored by her mother, and with both the dedication and any supposedly offensive words scribbled through.

It is understood that the building was constructed as a Windmill in the mid 18th Century by Joseph Lee of Warwick, described as Gentlemen and John Lamb of Warwick, Haberdasher. There is evidence of a sale in 1778 of the Mill as a going concern. The building continued to be used as a working Windmill until 1854 when steam power was introduced. In 1885 the mill machinery was removed and the building converted into a Water Tower. This involved the doubling of the height of the brickwork and surmounting it with a 26,000-gallon iron tank. This became the town's first Waterworks and provided most of Kenilworth's water supply until 1939. The supply from this tank was in fact in use for auxiliary purposes until approximately 1964. In 1970 Kenilworth Urban District Council, anxious to ensure the preservation of such an important and historic landmark, offered it for sale by tender on condition that it should be sympathetically restored and converted for use as a private dwelling house. Plans submitted by the Architect, Mr Edward Byron of Leamington Spa, on behalf of Lt Col Michael Wheat, were accepted and a conversion was commenced in late 1972 and completed in 1974. This imaginative conversion incorporates a new ground floor extension cleverly designed to harmonise with the character. The tower and the whole now forms a unique and comfortable home successfully linking the past with the present. From the upper floors there are magnificent views over the ancient town of Kenilworth with its famous castle and the tower stands within a few hundred yards of the field known as Parliament Piece where it is reputed Simon De Montfort held the first English Parliament in 1264. In 1975 the property won an Architectural Heritage Award from the United Kingdom Council for European Architectural Heritage. The Award, signed by HRH Duke of Edinburgh A notable tale involving the windmill from the early 19th century is of a brave local, one Jerry O'Hea who showed his fortitude by grabbing a hold of one of the windmill sails. Unfortunately his arm got caught and he was carried round and round until the miller applied the brake.

Bickley, Jr. and Michael Warren. It first started to produce Family Matters and Step by Step, which were both created by Bickley and Warren. It was originally aimed at Lorimar Television until 1993 when Warner Bros. Television took over Lorimar. By 1997, Bickley-Warren ceased to exist when Michael Warren joined Miller-Boyett Productions, rebranding it Miller-Boyett-Warren Productions. The company briefly returned in 2003, to produce the show Boohbah, but disbanded once again on July 20, 2006. History Before Bickley-Warren was ever established, founders/producers William Bickley and Michael Warren (who later joined Miller-Boyett) were writers and supervising producers for the Miller-Boyett produced Perfect Strangers, before becoming co-executive producers in the show's 1989-1990 season and executive producers/showrunners from the 1990-91 season until the 1993 series finale. At this time, Bickley and Warren went on to create shows for Miller-Boyett, starting with the Perfect Strangers spinoff Family Matters in 1989, which joined its parent show on ABC's TGIF lineup, and The Family Man in 1990, which aired for one season on CBS. Two years into the run of Family Matters, they formed a company that would be known as Bickley-Warren Productions, after they became the show's executive producers. The company lasted for seven years, during which Warren joined Miller and Boyett to form Miller-Boyett-Warren Productions in 1997, and began his process of winding down his partnership with Bickley. The new Miller-Boyett-Warren team initially produced the CBS sitcom Meego. The separate Bickley-Warren and Miller-Boyett nameplates remained in existence for one more year (1997‚Äì98) to produce the final season of Family Matters and Step By Step, both of which moved to CBS in the fall of 1997 and ended their runs in 1998. After the dissolution of Bickley-Warren, the recently renamed Miller-Boyett-Warren Productions would produce one more sitcom, ABC's Two of a Kind. While Family Matters, Step By Step and Getting By were produced by the Bickley-Warren and Miller-Boyett production companies jointly, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper and Kirk were not produced in association with Miller-Boyett Productions, and Perfect Strangers was not produced by Bickley-Warren Productions (even though Bickley and Warren executive produced the series for the show's final three seasons, even after the formation of their production company), though all of their series under the Bickley-Warren banner were produced by Lorimar/Warner Bros.

He succeeded his father, Rabbi Shmuel Bornsztain, as Rebbe upon the latter's death in 1926. Early life Bornsztain was born in the Hebrew month of Elul 5636Harav Dovid Bornstein -- The Sochatchover Rebbe. Hamodia Features, 11 November 2010, p. C3. in Nasielsk, Poland. He was the eldest son of Rabbi Shmuel and Yuta Leah Bornsztain. He had a younger brother, Chanoch Henoch, and at least one sister. At the time of his birth, his grandfather, Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain, later known as the Avnei Nezer, was serving as Rav of Nasielsk. In 1883, when the Avnei Nezer moved to the city of Sochatchov to serve as that city's Rav, his son Rabbi Shmuel and his family accompanied him and lived in a separate house in the same town. Young Dovid was taught privately by Rabbi Yitzchak Shlomo Lieberman of Ozorkow, but his primary teacher during his childhood was his grandfather, the Avnei Nezer. From him he learned both the revealed and hidden Torah, along with the Avnei Nezer's unique methodology for understanding the commentary of the Jewish sages, which formed the Hasidut of Sochatchov. Later he learned in his grandfather's yeshiva with students who were much older than he. In 1891 Bornsztain was engaged to Rachel, the daughter of Rabbi Chaim Yisrael Morgenstern, the Pilover Rebbe. Rachel died that same year, before the wedding took place. Two years later, Bornsztain married Esther Weingut, the daughter of Rabbi Mottel Weingut, a Ger Hasid from Wola Zadybska. Although the custom was for married men to live in or near the home of their father-in-law, Bornstzain and his wife lived in his grandfather's house, where he continued to learn from him. Entering the rabbinate Around 1906, (some date this event as late as 1910, after the death of the Avnei Nezer), Bornsztain accepted the rabbinate of Vishgorod. During his time in Vishgorod, he established a yeshiva patterned after the learning style of Sochatchover Hasidut, where hundreds of young men studied. With the outbreak of World War I, Bornsztain was forced to move to ≈Å√≥d≈∫. At war's end, he decided not to return to Vishgorod, but accepted the rabbinate of Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki. He was rabbi in Tomasz√≥w in years 1918-1926. Upon his father's death in January 1926, Bornsztain was appointed third Sochatchover Rebbe by his father's Hasidim. This appointment occurred during the funeral itself on 24 Tevet 5686 (1926). Third Sochatchover Rebbe The new Rebbe established his court in Pabianice, near ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He also founded a network of yeshivas under the name Beis Avraham (the name of the Avnei Nezer) in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Warsaw, and other Polish cities. In addition to his duties as Rebbe and rosh yeshiva, he was an active member of Agudath Israel and the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. He became known as one of the generation's leading Rebbes. He often spoke of the idea of settling the Land of Israel and encouraged his Hasidim to emigrate there. He was quoted as saying that he himself would have emigrated there, were it not for the thousands of Hasidim in Poland who depended on his leadership. He himself visited Palestine in 1924 and 1925. On his first trip, which he took with his brother Chanoch Henoch, he put a down payment on a plot of land south of Ramle with the intention of starting a Hasidic settlement. When he returned to Poland to raise the rest of the money, his plan was thwarted by an economic depression that hit Poland shortly after his return. He eventually lost his rights to the land, as well as the money he had invested in it. World War II On Rosh Hashana 1939 the Nazis invaded ≈Å√≥d≈∫ -- then home to the second- largest Jewish community in Europe -- and proceeded to snatch men off the streets for forced labor. They found the Rebbe in his home and beat him, cutting off some of his beard. Then they forced him to clean the streets. After this episode, his Hasidim obtained forged documents for him and smuggled him into the Warsaw Ghetto, where he lived incognito. However, his home became a center for Torah study and gatherings of rabbis and activists, and he continued to conduct his tish every Shabbat. He also supervised the education of several hundred Sochatchover yeshiva students in the ghetto and provided solace and encouragement to many. Before Rosh Hashanah 1940, the Rebbe sent out a letter encouraging his Hasidim and inspiring them to repentance. He was also the first to warn the residents of the ghetto that their lives were in danger. He convened a meeting of rabbis in Tammuz (summer) 1942 to warn them, but many did not believe that the danger was so great. The Rebbe worked in several factories, the last of which was a shoe factory run by a man named Schultz, who employed other Hasidic Rebbes and prominent rabbis. Out of fear that the Nazis were pursuing him, he moved from place to place constantly. When the deportations began, the Rebbe hid in a shop on 67 Genesha Street. He died there of heart failure on 17 November 1942 (8 Kislev 5703). He was the last person to be buried in the Genesha Street cemetery in Warsaw, and 500 Jews attended his funeral. The day after the funeral, the Nazis closed off the cemetery. Legacy and successor The Rebbe's wife, sons, daughters, sons-in- law and grandchildren were all murdered by the Nazis in the spring of 1943. Additionally, almost all of the Rebbe's many manuscripts were destroyed, save for a few pages containing chidushim (new Torah thoughts) on the Passover Haggadah. These pages were later published as Chasdei Dovid together with the ninth volume of Shem Mishmuel, his father's work, which deals with the Haggadah. The mantle of leadership of the Sochatchover Hasidim passed to his brother, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch, who had established a beth midrash in Bayit Vegan, Israel.

The agency is empowered to deal with terror related crimes across states without special permission from the states. The Agency came into existence with the enactment of the National Investigation Agency Act 2008 by the Parliament of India on 31 December 2008, which was passed after the deadly 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai. Such an attack clearly surfaced the failure of intelligence and ability to track such activities by existing agencies in India, hence the government of India realized the need of a specific body to deal with terror related activities in India, thereby establishing the NIA. Headquartered in New Delhi, the NIA has branches in Hyderabad, Guwahati, Kochi, Lucknow, Mumbai, Kolkata, Raipur and Jammu. It maintains NIA Most Wanted list. NIA headquarters in New Delhi The founding Director-General of NIA was Radha Vinod Raju, and he served till 31 January 2010. He was succeeded by Sharad Chandra Sinha till March 2013. Navneet Rajan Wasan held full charge of DG till July 2013. In July 2013, Sharad Kumar was appointed as the Chief of National Investigation Agency. In 2017, Y. C. Modi was named as Chief of NIA in September.  Bill  A Bill for the formation of the National Investigation Agency was passed by Parliament in December 2008. As per the Bill, NIA has concurrent jurisdiction which empowers the Central Agency to probe terror attacks in any part of the country, covering offences, including challenge to the country's sovereignty and integrity, bomb blasts, hijacking of aircraft and ships, attacks on nuclear installations. The amendments to the NIA Act has brought the offences relating to the smuggling in High-Quality Counterfeit Indian Currency under the definition of a terrorist Act aimed at damaging the monetary stability of the country and therefore can be investigated by the NIA. The ground staff of the agency in the national capital could be drawn from existing central staff and security organisations while in the states, permanent deputation from the state police could be taken. The National Investigative Agency Bill and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill on Tuesday, 30 Dec 2008, became a law as President Pratibha Patil gave her assent to the legislation which was passed in the last session of the parliament.  NIA (Amendment) Bill 2019  The NIA (Amendment) Bill 2019 was passed by the parliament on 17 July 2019. The Bill aims to give more teeth to the investigating powers of the NIA. It empowers the NIA to probe terror attacks targeting Indians and Indian interests abroad. The amended legislation, which aims to primarily empower the anti-terror agency to investigate scheduled offences such as human trafficking; circulation of fake currency; manufacture and sale of prohibited arms; and cyber-terrorism, was passed with a majority of 278 votes in favour and six against in the Lok Sabha. It was also passed in the Rajya Sabha after those opposed to it staged a walkout. This amendment will now also allow NIA to investigate the Sri Lanka Easter Bombings and Kabul Gurudwara bombing. Vision Agency aims to be a thoroughly professional investigative agency matching the best international standards. It aims to set the standards of excellence in counter terrorism and other national security related investigations at the national level by developing into a highly trained, partnership oriented workforce. It also aims at creating deterrence for existing and potential terrorist groups/individuals. It aims to develop as a storehouse of all terrorist related information. Jurisdiction The Agency has been empowered to conduct investigation and prosecution of offences under the Acts specified in the Schedule of the NIA Act. A State Government may request the Central Government to hand over the investigation of a case to the NIA, provided the case has been registered for the offences as contained in the schedule to the NIA Act. Central Government can also order NIA to take over investigation of any scheduled offense anywhere in the India. Officers of the NIA who are drawn from the Indian Police Service and Indian Revenue Service, have all powers, privileges and liabilities which the police officers have in connection with investigation of any offense. On 2016 Home minister Rajnath Singh wanted to end the central agency's dependence on approval from state police chiefs before confiscating or attaching assets of people accused of crime. The National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Act, 2019 states that, officers of the NIA will have the power to investigate scheduled offences committed outside India, subject to international treaties and domestic laws of other countries. The central government may direct the NIA to investigate such cases, as if the offence has been committed in India. The Special Court in New Delhi will have jurisdiction over these cases. Special NIA Courts Various Special Courts have been notified by the Central Government of India for trial of the cases registered at various police stations of NIA under Section 11 and 22 of the NIA Act 2008. Any question as to the jurisdiction of these courts is decided by the Central Government. These are presided over by a judge appointed by the Central Government on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the High Court with jurisdiction in that region. Supreme Court of India has also been empowered to transfer the cases from one special court to any other special court within or outside the state if the same is in the interest of justice in light of the prevailing circumstances in any particular state. The NIA Special Courts are empowered with all powers of the court of sessions under Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for trial of any offense. Trial by this courts are held on day-to-day basis on all working days and have precedence over the trial of any other case against the accused in any other court (not being a Special Court) and have to be concluded in preference to the trial of such other case. An appeal from any judgement, sentence or order, not being an interlocutory order, of a Special Court lies to the High Court both on facts and on law. Such an appeal can be heard by a division bench of two Judges of the High Court. At present there are 38 Special NIA Courts. State Governments have also been empowered to appoint one or more such special courts in their states.  Recent success of NIA  = Individual terrorists = In year 2012, NIA with the assistance of Interpol and Saudi Intelligence agencies has successfully arrested terrorists namely: Abu Jundal alias Abu Hamza, (Indian national), Fasih Mohammad and Yaseen Bhatkal (Indian Mujahideen). In the year 2013, NIA was successful in arresting two senior members of Indian Mujahideen, namely Ahmed Siddibappa Zaraar alias Yasin Bhatkal and Asadullah Akhtar alias Haddi, from Indo Nepal border in Bihar on 29 August 2013. These two were instrumental in the commission of a number of terrorist attacks across the country for the past several years, under the banner of Indian Mujahideen, a proscribed terrorist organisation. = Terrorist organisations =  Jamaat-Ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh  In 2014 NIA investigators began probing the conspiracy of Jamaat-Ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) a proscribed terrorist organisation in Bangladesh, which was conspiring to spread its terror network in Indian states of West Bengal, Assam and Jharkhand. The terrorist conspiracy in India aimed at recruitment, radicalisation and training of vulnerable Indian youths in violent Jihadist ideology and terrorist acts, collection of funds for the organisational activities in India and training them in fabrication and use of Improvised explosive devices (IED's) and firearms for terrorist acts. NIA has arrested 20 persons in the case so far and 27 accused have been charged so far for their role in the conspiracy, including 5 Bangladeshi nationals. NIA is actively seeking and receiving cooperation from the Government of Bangladesh and law enforcement agencies in the ongoing investigations.  Jammu and Kashmir war on terror  NIA has been active in the war against terror in Jammu and Kashmir. On 18 January 2018, NIA filed a chargesheet against 12 people including Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group chief Hafiz Saeed and Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin. This chargesheet was filed after nearly eight months of investigations spanning six states in India during which over 300 witnesses were examined, 950 \\"incriminating documents\\" and 600 electronic devices were seized. NIA has also stated that the war against terror in Kashmir is not about terror funding alone, it's about a conspiracy to wage war against India. During the investigation the NIA has arrested people allegedly involved in stone-pelting incidents for the first time including Kashmiri photojournalist Kamran Yusuf. = Naxals = It has identified two Naxalite commanders in Bastar who were part of the ambush that killed almost the entire Congress' Chhattisgarh top brass. =Constitutionality= Under The constitution of India, law and order is a state subject. There have been questions raised on how NIA is usurping state rights under the guise of fighting terror.

Life O'Neill was the son of Phelim Bacagh O'Neill. In 1556 he became lord of Lower Clandeboye. O'Neill sided with the English government in Ireland to help bolster his position against the threat of Shane O'Neill of Tyrone to the west and a large influx of Scots in the Glens of Antrim to his north. In 1568, Brian McPhelim would be knighted for his service to the Crown as part of William Piers' campaign against Shane O'Neill of Tyrone. O'Neill and his father-in-law, Brian Carragh O'Neill, would wage a private war against Shane O'Neill's successor Turlough Luineach O'Neill. The government were not impressed and grew suspicious of O'Neill. In 1571, Sir Thomas Smith, Queen Elizabeth's principal Secretary of State, was able to get a grant for the entire territory of Clandeboye. Whilst the Clandeboye O'Neill's had been established in that area for two centuries, it had once been part of the Earldom of Ulster, which upon the death of its last earl in the 15th-century passed into ownership of the Crown. Smith had his son Thomas put in charge of starting a colony and planned to firstly settle the Ards peninsula and then eventually moving westwards through Clandeboye via a mixture of conquest and plantation. The planned plantation was mishandled especially due to Smith advertising the venture, and Smith went to Carrickfergus to negotiate with Brian O'Neill who was unhappy about the plans. The negotiations failed to happen and Brian McPhelim set about razing any buildings (excluding abbeys and priories) he could find throughout the northern Ards peninsula that could provide shelter. In 1573, a similar scheme for the plantation of County Antrim (the south of which was north Clandeboye) by Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, overtook Smith's grant, and eventually saw Smith cede his claims to north Clandeboye to Essex. Despite this, Brian McPhelim continued to create unrest and disturbances throughout his territory that heavily affected the schemes. Eventually the scheme had to be altered focusing on coastal settlements, however this too failed due to Brian McPhelim. Eventually Essex had to console himself with a grant for the Islandmagee peninsula on the east coast of Antrim, to which he was able to successfully plant all the way south to Belfast. These schemes were all part of the Enterprise of Ulster. Death It is alleged that Essex, who had been invited to Brian McPhelim's castle in Castlereagh, near Belfast, for dinner, had Brian McPhelim, his wife and brother captured, and murdered between 100 and 200 attainders in attendance in front of their eyes. After that Brian McPhelim, and his two relations were taken to Carrickfergus Castle and executed. In 1574, Brian McPhelim was hanged for opposing the local plantations. Division of Clandeboye After his death, Essex promoted Brian McPhelim's son-in-law, Neill McBrian Fertagh O'Neill, son of Brian Fertagh O'Neill who was a cousin of Brian McPhelim, to the lordship of Clandeboye regardless of the other claimants. The inter- familial disputes that arose from this resulted in Lord-Deputy, Sir John Perrot, dividing Clandeboye between the competing members of the Clandeboye O'Neill clan in 1584: Shane McBrian O'Neill, Brian McPhelim's son, received three-quarters of north Clandeboye; Hugh Oge O'Neill, son of Brian McPhelim's brother Hugh, received a quarter of north Clandeboye, centred on Edenduffcarrick; Con McNeill O'Neill, Neill McBrian Fertagh's uncle and Brian McPhelim's cousin, was granted all of south Clandeboye, afterwards known as Upper Clandeboy. North Clandeboye would become known as Lower Clandeboye. The arrangement in Lower Clandeboye led to bitter strife between the first cousins, Shane and Hugh Oge, resulting in the killing of the latter in 1586. After this Neill received Hugh Oge's portion of Lower Clandeboye. Fate of Clandeboye Despite Brian McPhelim's attempts to thwart English settlement of his lands, the son of Neill McBrian Fertagh, Con, who succeeded his father as lord of Upper Clandeboye, made a deal with Hugh Montgomery and James Hamilton that resulted in the three-fold division of the lands comprising his estate in 1605. He sold off the rest and died in 1619. Their subsequent plantations expanded rapidly. The scheme for settling Antrim including the territory of Lower Clandeboye passed from Essex to Sir Arthur Chichester, who was more successful than his predecessor. References External links Henry A.

James: Introduction, Outline, and Argument. Bible.org This chapter is divided into 27 verses. =Verse 1= \\"James\\": identified by early church leaders (Eusebius, Origen, etc.) to be James the Just (the brother of Jesus) (), who was a distinguished leader of the first-century church in Jerusalem (; ; ). He was the oldest of the four brothers of Jesus born to Mary and Joseph (; ); a non-believer of Jesus as Christ until after the resurrection (), perhaps as a result of a special post- resurrection appearance of Jesus to him (). \\"Servant\\": is 'a title of authority' (cf. ; ; ; Philippians 1:1). Bauckham suggests that James does not state his family relationship to Jesus because he does not see it as a basis for authority (cf. ). =Verse 4= \\"Perfect\\" (Greek: teleios; used two times here) and \\"complete\\" point to the theme of \\"maturity\\". =Verse 5= \\"Wisdom\\" can be rendered as \\"skill for living\\", not 'primarily knowledge', but 'godly behavior in difficult situations' (cf. ). =Verse 12= \\"Blessed\\" here is in the sense of \\"to be richly rewarded by God\\" both in the current world (after character development in 1:4), and the next (Matthew 5:11‚Äì12). =Verse 13= \\"Tempted\\": different from the previous use, as 'exercising grace' in relation to joy and boasting, here the \\"temptations\\" are the 'issue of shame and death', that is 'to be watched against'. \\"Tempted by God\\" (NKJV; KJV: \\"Tempted of God\\"): A holy God without iniquity does not delight in sin, being contrary to his nature and perfection, so he will not tempt another to sin. Sinful men often charge God for their sins, or temptations to sin, similar to Adam, when fallen () who, to excuse himself, lays the blame to Eve (\\"the woman\\"), and ultimately to God, who gave her to him; suggesting that if it had not been for the woman (had God not given him the woman to be with him), he should not have eaten of the forbidden fruit, nor should he have had any temptation to it, and therefore it was God's fault. \\"God cannot be tempted with evil\\" or \\"evils\\": the Israelites tempted God at Massah and Meribah, with their murmuring, distrust and unbelief, poking God's patience and his power; and Jesus has been tempted by evil men, and by evil things, but he cannot be tempted \\"to evil\\" (as rendered in the Ethiopian version), nor can he be tempted by anything in himself, who is pure and holy, or by anything, to do any sinful action: \\"Nor does He Himself tempt anyone\\": that is, 'to sin'. God tempted Abraham, to try his faith, love, and obedience to God; he tempted the Israelites in the wilderness, to humble them, and prove what was in their hearts; and he tempted Job, and tried his faith and patience; and so God 'tempts and tries' his righteous people, by afflictions, more or less: but he never tempts or solicits them to sin; temptations to sin come from another direction.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible - James 1:13 =Verse 27= \\"Keep oneself from being polluted by the world\\": in the sense of not looking for security or advancement in the things valued by the people in the world, such as 'no need to hold on to money', so Christians can be give freely and generously.

Before the game's release, Dante's Inferno underwent a prominent, at times elaborate marketing campaign led by the game's publisher Electronic Arts. This included the release of a fake religious game called Mass: We Pray, a motion controller- based game supposedly allowing players to engage in an interactive prayer and church sermon. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the game's art style and level design, with some comparing it to God of War III. A direct-to-DVD animated movie based on the video game, titled Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic, was released simultaneously with it. Gameplay Dante using the Holy Cross to absolve one of Hell's minions. Dante's Inferno is an action-adventure game. The player controls Dante, the game's protagonist, and engages in fast-paced combat, platforming and environment-based puzzles. In the game, Dante's primary weapon is Death's scythe that can be used in a series of combination attacks and finishing moves. His secondary weapon is a Holy Cross that fires a volley of energy as a projectile attack. In addition, Dante can use numerous magic based attacks and abilities channeled from a mana pool to help in combat, many of which are obtained as the game progresses. A quick time event system is used when attempting to discharge the demon of its master (unbind from host) and during boss fights, where players must press the highlighted button on screen in order to continue the chain of attacks, or be countered and wounded otherwise. Many attack combinations and abilities can be unlocked in exchange for souls, an in-game currency that is collected upon defeating enemies or locating soul fountains. Each of these skills fall into two categories; Holy (represented by blue orbs) or Unholy (represented by red orbs) skill trees. At the beginning of the game, both skill trees are equal in power, but as Dante gains more Holy and Unholy experience, more abilities become available for purchase. Experience is collected through the game's \\"Punish or Absolve\\" system, where upon defeating enemies, Dante can either punish and dismember them or absolve and save them with the Holy Cross. Much experience can also be accumulated in punishing or absolving the damned souls of many famous figures in history that appear in Dante Alighieri's original The Divine Comedy whereupon choosing their fates, players enter a mini game where the characters' \\"sins\\" move towards the center of the screen, pressing required action symbols once the sin is in place. Players are rewarded with more souls and experience as the number of sins collected increases. The game involves large sections of platforming, including swinging between ropes and climbing walls, both of which can involve hazards such as fire or swinging blades. There is also a series of environment-based puzzle sequences that can impair the progress of Dante's quest, such as requiring the correct positioning of movable objects or pulling levers at the appropriate time. In addition, there are numerous hidden passages where Biblical relics can be found and equipped to improve Dante's abilities. Plot The story follows Dante, a Templar knight from the Crusade who (despite his faith) has committed numerous atrocities during the Third Crusade. At the city of Acre, Dante is entrusted to keep a group of Saracen prisoners safe so King Richard I could obtain a holy relic from Saladin. But once he brutally slaughters them, Dante is ordered to take the holy relic. During the attack, Dante is stabbed in the back by an Assassin, whereupon Death appears and condemns Dante to \\"everlasting damnation for [his] sins,\\" despite being promised by a Bishop that his sins would be absolved. Dante refuses to accept his fate, vows to redeem himself, and defeats Death while taking his scythe. Dante leaves the Crusade, stitching a red holy cross-shaped tapestry onto his torso, depicting every sin he has committed in the past. He returns to Florence, only to find his lover Beatrice Portinari and father Alighiero brutally murdered. Beatrice's soul appears before Dante, telling him that she knew he would come after her before a shadowy manifestation of Lucifer drags her into darkness. After making it to a chapel, Dante blesses the holy cross that Beatrice gave him upon making their vows to be true to each other, to protect him against the evils that await. Upon doing so, a crack in the earth opens up, allowing Dante to descend to the Gates of Hell. At the Gates, he encounters Virgil, who knows of Dante's past sins, yet agrees to guide him through the Nine Circles of Hell in exchange for Beatrice putting in a word for him in Heaven. Dante begins his descent at the shores of Hell where the newly damned souls are forced aboard the great ferry of Charon. Dante forces Charon to sail him across. After this, Charon is destroyed when Dante tears his head off using a beast-mount. After arriving at Limbo, Dante confronts the serpentine Judge of the Damned, King Minos. After Minos denies Dante passage deeper into Hell, Dante fights the Judge and kills him. Dante then enters the second circle, Lust, where he enters the Carnal Tower to find Beatrice, whose soul is slowly being corrupted into a succubus by Lucifer, who also reveals to her that Dante broke his vows to Beatrice, raping a captive woman back in Acre, as the woman offered to have sex with him in exchange for sparing the life of her \\"brother\\". Reaching the top of the tower, Dante confronts and slays the gigantic Queen Cleopatra and her lover Mark Antony. Entering the third circle Gluttony, Dante slays its guardian the \\"Great Worm\\" Cerberus. It is here where Lucifer shows Dante how Beatrice and his father Alighiero met their demise, both being slain by the assassin from Acre, revealed to be the husband, not the brother as she claimed, of the captive Dante raped. In the fourth circle; Greed, Dante encounters the greatly deformed soul of his father Alighiero. After overcoming the puzzles of the fallen God of Wealth Plutus, Dante defeats Alighiero and absolves him. In the fifth circle, Anger, Dante begins to float across the vile River Styx on what appears to be a floating platform. Upon reaching the other side, however, the platform is in fact the top of the head of the gigantic fiery demon Phlegyas who attacks Dante. Overcoming this, Lucifer appears before Dante with Beatrice who, broken-hearted by Dante's betrayals, willingly gives herself to Lucifer by eating the forbidden fruit. Dante rides atop Phlegyas who he controls to smash down the walls of the City of Dis and into the sixth circle, Heresy. Beyond lies the seventh circle, Violence, including Phlegethon and the Wood of Suicides. Within the woods Dante encounters his mother Bella. He becomes deeply saddened and enraged, having been told as a child that she died of an illness but in fact hanged herself because of his father's cruelty. Absolving her of her sin, he continues beyond the woods to the Abominable Sands for those violent against God, where Dante also encounters his former comrade Crusader and future brother-in-law Francesco, who is now a horribly disfigured version of his former self and desires revenge against Dante for his state of being. Upon defeating Francesco, Dante absolves him and descends into the eighth circle, Fraud. Before Dante can reach Lucifer, Beatrice puts him through the challenges of ten stages of the Malebolge, each depicting the fraudsters throughout history from simple thieves to the false popes. At the entrance of the ninth and last circle, Treachery, Dante insists to Beatrice that he has faced all of his sins. Beatrice reminds him that he slaughtered the Saracen prisoners out of anger and that Francesco died taking the blame for it. Realizing that he has sinned beyond redemption, Dante admits that his place is in Hell and asks Beatrice to forgive him. This act of supreme sacrifice undoes Beatrice's transformation and restores her to her former self. As Dante watches, the Archangel Gabriel descends from Heaven and carries Beatrice's soul away, promising Dante that he will see Beatrice again and that his redemption is close at hand. Journeying through the icy realm of Treachery and fighting his way to Lake Cocytus, Dante finally confronts Lucifer himself, an enormous three-faced demon chained within the frozen lake. After defeating the giant demon, Lucifer reveals that several enormous chains Dante had destroyed to proceed were the Chains of Judecca, which kept him imprisoned in Lake Cocytus and inside the body of the giant three-headed demon. Lucifer reveals that he merely used Beatrice as bait to get Dante to break the chains and free him. Lucifer emerges from the giant monster in his true form, a horned, satyr-like monster, and battles Dante. Through great struggle, Dante is able to defeat Lucifer and impales him on Death's Scythe. Before Dante can attack again, Lucifer summons the vision of the assassin stabbing Dante in Acre; which shows him collapsing to the ground. Dante is horrified to realize that he actually died and thus cannot leave Hell, which is forbidden by God. Lucifer gleefully reveals that, now free, he will rise from Hell, overthrow God and seize Heaven, eliminating all that is good from the universe forever. But Dante, with the aid of the souls he gained through his trials, absolves himself and re-imprisons Lucifer deeper in the ice once again. Dante is then taken to Purgatory, where he sees himself near Mount Purgatory with Beatrice's soul awaiting him in Paradise. He then rips off the tapestry from his chest and walks away with Beatrice's soul. As the ripped tapestry disintegrates to a snake that slithers away, Lucifer's haunting laugh echoes for the final time, implying that the snake is his manifestation and that Lucifer awaits his revenge or that he will only be destroyed until the Last Judgment. Development A playable demo was released for PlayStation 3 on December 10, 2009, and for Xbox 360 on December 24, 2009. =Release= Dante's Inferno was first released across Europe on February 5, 2010. In addition to the standard retail copy of the game, a second limited special edition of the game for both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was released alongside known as the \\"Death Edition\\". Along with the standard copy of the game, the Death Edition was packaged in a fold out card packaging depicting each circle of hell as well as a second bonus disc that featured a making-of documentary, the documentary \\"Dante in History\\", the full soundtrack, a documentary on the creation of the music and audio, a digital art book (Barlowe's Inferno) edited by visual designer Wayne Barlowe, over 10 minutes of scenes from Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic, and a digital reprint of the complete original poem in English. The edition also included a voucher containing an online activated code for an additional skin model for Dante, being the space suit of Isaac Clarke, the main character from Visceral's previous game Dead Space. The Death Edition was released exclusive to the GAME store in the UK. Another UK retailer, Gamestation, also gave away miniature figurines of Dante to those who pre- ordered the game. The same edition was later released in Australia along with the standard copy on February 15, 2010, exclusive to EB Games. The game was later released in North America on February 9, 2010. Unlike the Europe and Australia release, a special version called the Divine Edition was released in place of the standard copy for the PlayStation 3 only. Similar to the Death Edition, the \\"Divine Edition\\" includes nearly all the same features except the Isaac Clarke costume and the animated scene but instead includes a code for the Dark Forest downloadable content, to be released later in March. =Downloadable content= Upon its release, a series of downloadable content (DLC) game packs were released, each containing a number of souls, used for purchasing new abilities. The first contained 500 souls and was free of charge while the rest contained 1500, 3000 and 5000 souls and cost a relatively small amount and could only be downloaded once. The first traditional piece of downloadable content was released a month after release on March 4, entitled Dark Forest, a prologue level loosely based on the opening of The Divine Comedy, that sees Dante in a dark forest before meeting Virgil. The content includes two new enemies known as the \\"Forest Siren\\" and \\"Death Knight\\" and involves a series of puzzles to overcome. In addition to the level, the download also includes an additional \\"Disco Inferno\\" costume, a novelty piece in the style of polyester disco fashion wear. Numerous alternative costumes have also been released, including Florentine Dante based on the real life poet Dante Alighieri released on February 18, 2010 and Animated Film Dante, based on the appearance of the character from Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic, released one week later. Trials of St Lucia, released on April 29, 2010, features cooperative gameplay and a game-editor. Players are able to share their created maps and levels with others. The new playable character in this DLC is St. Lucia, a Christian martyr described as Dante's guardian angel. Marketing Dante's Inferno demo booth at the 2010 WonderCon Before the game's release, Dante's Inferno underwent a prominent, at times elaborate marketing campaign led by the game's publisher Electronic Arts. The numerous advertisements highlighted certain sins associated with the circles of hell, at times promoting fake services before accusing the viewer of the sin linked to it. Electronic Arts partnered with GameStop for a one-day promotion of Dante's Inferno on September 9, 2009 (9/9/9). Those that pre-ordered the game were offered a $6.66 discount, the Number of the Beast. In addition, EA conducted an unsolicited mailing in which checks for $200 were sent to selected video game critics, with the following note: A viral marketing campaign was also launched featuring a website and ad for a fake religious game called Mass: We Pray, a motion controller-based game supposedly allowing players to engage in an interactive prayer and church sermon. When attempting to order the game, the website deems you a heretic and plays to a trailer for Dante's Inferno, as well as providing links to the related Facebook application called \\"Go to Hell\\". The application, created by Visceral Games lets users condemn their friends, groups, or photos to one of the nine circles of hell where they can then vote to punish or absolve them, or torment them with activities like \\"beast massage\\" or \\"succubus castration.\\" Later in October 2009, EA sent a series of packages to Veronica Belmont at Qore, the PlayStation: The Official Magazine offices and Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of the Escapist's Zero Punctuation column. The package contained a small wooden box which, when opened, played the Rick Astley song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", thus \\"Rickrolling\\" the journalists that received it. The music could not be stopped through any means other than destroying the box using the hammer and goggles provided. After destroying the box, such as Veronica Belmont who posted the act on YouTube, a note read that they had given into Wrath as the note then found within the box predicted. EA produced a commercial for the game that was shown during Super Bowl XLIV, a fast-paced cinematic of Dante's descent into hell, overplayed by what was considered an unusual use of Bill Withers' song \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\". Time magazine reporter James Poniewozik referred to the ad as \\"something magical and funny.\\" According to EA product manager Phil Marineu, the decision to air the ad was to concentrate on more solid titles that they believe can break through to the masses. Another secretly fake commercial for the fictional company \\"Hawk Panther\\" encouraged viewers to visit the Hawk Panther website in order to be able to steal their best friend's girlfriend. If the link to find out more about the Hawk Panther systems is clicked on a message appears stating, \\"TREACHERY! Thou are condemned to the 9th Circle. Thou hast broken the bonds of trust with thy kindred. Even conspiring to stealeth thy best friend's soul mate is the worst kind of mortal offense imaginable. You shall pay for thy treachery by spending an eternity immersed up to your face, the place where shame shows itself, in the putrid, frozen waters of Hell.\\" The site also shows a trailer of Dante's Inferno and a link to buy the game. The Facebook application developer Lolapps similarly adapted a Facebook role-playing game, Battle of the Damned, that lets users fight through the nine circles of hell to rescue their murdered and damned wife. It rose nearly 1 million monthly active users in less than a year after launching. Prior to Dante's Infernos release, in June 2009, a protest began during E3 2009 in Los Angeles to oppose the game. Around 20 protesters, claiming to be from a church in Ventura County, held up signs that called the game sacrilegious and labeled it possibly insensitive to people's beliefs. Protesters even went as far as calling EA the anti-christ. This led to EA being accused by many people of staging the fiasco to use it as a marketing hoax. A few days later, it was officially confirmed by EA spokesman Tammy Scachter that they had hired people to protest the game and that there was no actual protest. However, in the aftermath of this revelation, several Christian bloggers protested to this, calling it an \\"anti-Christian\\" stunt. Reception =Dante's Inferno= The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. While there was substantial praise for the art style and level design, numerous critics drew unfavorable comparisons with Sony's popular God of War series, among other more fundamental criticisms, such as monotonous and repetitive gameplay in the latter half of the game. One of the most praised aspects was the game's depiction of Hell, considered creative yet graphic in nature. GamePro found the unique designs of the circles of Hell to be \\"impressively constructed\\", getting \\"a lot of mileage out of the unique setting\\". While some critics like IGN acknowledged the liberties taken with the original source material, they still observed that \\"much of what you see is appropriate for a game that tries to explore the extreme nature of Hell and its punishments\\", calling the overall style \\"visually impressive\\". Other critics like GameSpy even found some enemy and setting designs \\"shocking\\" yet still could \\"appreciate that this is Hell, and it's supposed to be disturbing\\". However, some reviews felt the creativity waned towards the end of the game, such as GameSpot who felt \\"Dante's epic quest loses momentum long before you reach the end\\", praising earlier levels such as Lust and Gluttony yet criticizing the 10 stage challenge level of Fraud and the use of enemies outside of their respective circle. PlayStation Official Magazine ‚Äì UK also echoed this view, saying that the game was \\"just going through motions for the last three or four hours\\", despite what it considered to have a \\"robust fighting system\\" and being \\"visually strong\\". The most recurring comment over the gameplay of Dante's Inferno was its similarities to the God of War games. Destructoid felt that being similar to what is regarded as a great game is a positive by stating \\"You're not going to find a wholly original gameplay experience with Dante's Inferno, but that doesn't mean it's not a hell of an entertaining package - it's one that fans of action shouldn't miss.\\" Eurogamer on the other hand felt the game was \\"a God of War clone at its core\\", that while \\"not a terrible game, it's just not an original one\\", a view GameTrailers echoed by stating \\"battles can be engaging, but lack some of the grace and refinement exhibited by games like God of War\\". While Game Informer also found the gameplay to be too familiar, they did find the additional elements such as the punish/absolve mechanic and usable relics to give \\"Dante's Inferno some individuality\\". Wired gave the PS3 version a score of seven stars out of ten and called it \\"a ballsy take on literature that worships at the altar of God of War.\\" However, Nick Cowen of The Daily Telegraph gave the same version six out of ten, saying that it was \\"by no means a terrible game, but it's not an essential title and I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it. If a sequel is on the cards ‚Äì as is hinted by the ending ‚Äì the developers would do well to institute a more consistent level of quality. Until then, one can't damn the players of Dante's Inferno for trading the nine circles of hell for a trip to Hades with Kratos.\\" The A.V. Club gave the Xbox 360 version a C+, saying, \\"The game's rivers of blood, corpse-piles, and wailing souls make for a morbid, depression-inducing milieu. It's a relief to be shut out of the place once the final credits roll.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. Regarding such similarities, in an interview for PlayStation Official Magazine ‚Äì UK, God of War III director Stig Asmussen instead praised the game, stating \\"We've been intrigued about Dante's Inferno. This is my favourite genre, and the more people that are making [these games] the better\\", going on to say \\"and this is a really rich story they're building on, it's very interesting. The day that the demo came out we were trying to download it on PSN at midnight. We all wanted to see it.\\" Columbia University Professor Teodolinda Barolini, a former president of the Dante Society of America, criticized the game for its depiction of Beatrice, declaring, \\"Of all the things that are troubling, the sexualization and infantilization of Beatrice are the worst. Beatrice is the human girl who is dead and is now an agent of the divine. She is not to be saved by him, she is saving him. That's the whole point! Here, she has become the prototypical damsel in distress. She's this kind of bizarrely corrupted Barbie doll.\\" Other reviews of the game include similar comments from professors regarding the characters: \\"Beatrice saves Dante... not the other way around,\\" says Professor Arielle Saiber, an Italian literature professor at Bowdoin College. United States NPD Group sales data showed that the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Dante's Inferno sold 242,500 and 224,700 copies respectively in the month of February 2010. The two editions also debuted together on the UK's top 10 games list for that month. =Trials of St. Lucia= The Xbox 360 version of the Trials of St. Lucia DLC received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PS3 version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameTrailers said that the Xbox 360 version \\"may be a little steep [at 10 dollars], but it gives Dante a shot of much-needed replayability. With online co-op, a seemingly-enthusiastic community, and a suite of solid online features, the original game suddenly feels like it has some legs.\\" However, GameSpot said that the PS3 version \\"does an admirable job of turning the worst idea from the original adventure into something entertaining, but it's still hampered by the same problems that made those initial trials such a drag. It's only entertaining to swing your blood-soaked scythe for so long because the combat is shallow and the objectives only offer a slight change to the core experience. However, the in-depth editor, extra playable character, and cooperative mode are different enough to lure back anyone anxious to be wrapped up in hell's clutches for a few more hours.\\" =Controversy= In October 2009, it was announced that the game would include a PlayStation 3 trophy and an Xbox 360 achievement entitled \\"Bad Nanny\\", which is awarded to players for killing monsters resembling children, supposedly the lost souls of unbaptized infants. This sparked a conflict with the International Nanny Association (INA), in which they encouraged supporters to oppose the game. The INA claimed that the achievement is offensive to real nannies and that it also promotes real-life violence. The INA asked the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to omit the reward and elements of infant violence. The ESRB insisted that its role was merely to label products appropriately, not to censor them, so their request could not be met. Dante's Inferno was released with the \\"Bad Nanny\\" achievement intact. Legacy =Sequel= Since the game ends in a cliffhanger with Dante reaching Mount Purgatory, it was widely speculated that a sequel, based on the second poem in The Divine Comedy, Purgatorio, would enter production. Despite this, it was announced that Visceral had no plans for a sequel. In November 2011, Joshua Rubin announced that he had been hired as a writer for a video game sequel that was heavily hinted to be a sequel to Dante's Inferno. However, as of 2018, no further information of any kind regarding a sequel to Dante's Inferno has been forthcoming, and Visceral Games was closed in October 2017. =Animated film= Film Roman, the Starz Entertainment unit behind Dead Space: Downfall, released an animated direct-to-DVD version of the story that was released simultaneously with the video game. The Dante's Inferno project had separate anime studios being tapped to create visuals of the nine levels of the Inferno. Starz Entertainment is looking to sell both animated films to international TV buyers at the MIP market. The animation studios that participated in the making of Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic, in order, are Film Roman, Manglobe, Dong Woo, JM Animation, and Production I.G.. The released movie shows a difference in storyline and has been divided into four different styles. =Upcoming live action film= In 2013 it was reported that Universal Studios is developing a live action film based on the video game with director Fede √Ålvarez to direct and produced by Eric Newman and Marc Abraham with EA Entertainment vice president Patrick O'Brien. = Comics = WildStorm published a six-part comic book series based on the video game from December 2009 (two month before the video game release) through May 2010. The series was written by Christos Gage with art by Diego Latorre. = Backwards compatibility = As of July 17, 2018, Dante's Inferno was playable on the Xbox One as a backwards compatible title. It was also added to the EA Access Vault on July 19, 2018.

SWNCC was an important precursor to the National Security Council, and represents perhaps the most successful integration of military and civilian assets in the history of U.S. foreign policy. As a result, it has received renewed scrutiny in the wake of the Iraq War as the U.S. government attempts to overhaul its interagency national security system.Project on National Security Reform, \\"Case Study Volume 1: Planning for Reconstruction and Transformation of Japan After WWII\\" by Peter Schaefer and Clayton Schaefer  Origins of SWNCC  During World War II, interagency coordination had been largely informal and mediated by president Roosevelt, but recognizing the need for deeper integration, the Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Navy began holding weekly meetings to work through shared problems. However, the so-called \\"Committee of Three\\" had no specific mandate or authority, and this weakness became apparent as the war moved toward its conclusions and the details of occupation planning began to occupy the various departments. As soon as he became Secretary of State, Edward Stettinius sent a letter to War Secretary Henry Stimson and Navy Secretary James Forrestal proposing that they create a jointly managed secretariat to plan the occupations and achieve full integration of U.S. foreign policy. The secretariat was headed by Roosevelt favorite, Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy.  Activities  SWNCC's plans for the occupation of Europe and Japan were aimed at anticipating and addressing the issues that might confront U.S. forces tasked with occupying and running former enemy states. SWNCC brought together the top experts in the U.S. government and the academy to work on all aspects of the plan. For instance, one of the key decisions which faced the team ‚Äì the status of the Emperor of Japan ‚Äì was studied by academic-turned-bureaucrat Hugh Borton. After the war, when Borton returned to the academy, he observed that his 1943 memo recommending the retention of Hirohito was largely unchanged as it passed through the planning process and subsequent implementation by Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur.Borton, Hugh, Preparation for the Occupation of Japan, The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Feb., 1966), pp. 205. The SWNCC began its activities by reviewing and compiling existing work on occupation strategy, and in many cases summoning the responsible experts to participate in the committee. Within the U.S. government, planning for the occupation of Japan actually predated the attack on Pearl Harbor, so there were significant resources for the newly created organization.Stimson, Henry L. and Bundy, McGeorge, On Active Service in Peace and War, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1947, pg. 553. SWNCC in essence took academic and government research and used it to create a detailed set of policies which included the views of the military and civilian bureaucracies and which would be implemented by the military government once it took control.  Institutional practices  SWNCC consisted of a secretariat which held regular meetings and a number of working groups tasked to address specific problems and present their findings to the committee. Both the working groups and the full committee operated on a strict consensus principle. Any issues which could not be resolved between the participants was advanced to higher levels of leadership. However, it is important to note that of the 750 issues considered by the SWNCC, most were resolved at or below the Assistant Secretary level and only six cases were forwarded to the White House for final decisions.

Ancient Egypt  The earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt. Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE. They regularly placed cut flowers in vases,http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210629/floral- decoration, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Floral decoration,\\" retrieved 15 May 2013. and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations. Flowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance. The lotus flower or water lily, for example, was considered sacred to Isis and was often included in arrangements. Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and garlands of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs.https://web.archive.org/web/20170812180130/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060629-egypt- flowers.html, John Roach, National Geographic News, \\"Ancient Flowers Found in Egypt Coffin\\", 29 June 2006. These included blue scilla, poppy-flowered anemone, Iris sibirica, delphinium, narcissus, palm tree, papyrus and rose. Egyptian wall paintings depicting roses have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra's time.  Ancient Greece and ancient Rome  The Greeks and the Romans also used flowers. The ancient Greeks used flowers and herbs for adornment and decorations included in artwork. They did not often use vases, focusing instead on garlands and wreaths. They would place plant material, such as olive branches, in terracotta. The leafy branches were probably used for weddings. They also tossed petals onto floors and beds. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had preferences for the flowers and foliage they used. The most popular foliage used by the Greeks and the Romans were acorns, oak leaves, laurel, ivy, bay and parsley. Laurel wreaths were presented to winners of athletic competitions in the ancient Olympics; these wreaths were also awarded to individuals winning competition in poetic meets, while in Rome they symbolized a military victory and crowned the successful commander in honor of his triumph. The garland wreath was a symbol to the Greeks of power, honor, allegiance, dedication; it was awarded in honor of athletes, poets, civic leaders, soldier, and heroes. The preferred flowers include roses, hyacinths, honeysuckle, violets, and lilies. Other flowers such as tulips, larkspur, and marigolds were also selected for their shape, color, and form. Wealth and power led the Romans and Greeks to the greater luxury in the use of flowers which, like the Egyptian, were used in religious rites. At banquets, roses were strewn on the floor to a depth of one foot, and the flowers \\"rained\\" from the ceiling. The fragrance of so many roses was almost suffocating. The Romans used the roses at many meals and because of its overwhelming fragrance it was known as the \\"Hour of Rose\\".  Ancient China  The Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE, in the Han era of ancient China. Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine. Practitioners of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE. They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers. The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory. Buddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants. Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning. For example, the bamboo, the peach tree, and the pear tree symbolized longevity. The tiger lily, the pomegranate, and the orchid symbolized fertility. The most honored of all flowers was the peony. Considered the ‚Äúking of flowers‚Äù, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status. During the period 500CE to 1453CE, the Byzantine Empire made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design. The foliage was placed in chalices and urns, which were further decorated with brightly colored flowers and fruit. Flowers commonly included in these arrangements were daisies, lilies, cypress, carnations, and pine. Ribbons were also commonly used, and leaves and tiny flowers were set in arching lines to give an twisted effect to garlands.  Europe  Le Bouquet, by Marc Saint-Sa√´ns 1951 is among the best and most representative French tapestries of the fifties. It is a tribute to Saint-Saens‚Äôs predilection for scenes from nature and rustic life. HENG, Mich√®le (1989), Marc Saint-Saens d√©corateur mural et peintre cartonnier de tapisserie, 1964 pages. Flower arranging arrived in Europe around 1000 CE, and was particularly popular in churches and monasteries where flowers and plants were used for food as well as for decoration. As crusaders came back from the Middle East, they brought with them new and interesting plants. As a result, European countries began experimenting with plants that were previously unknown to them. Middle Ages (AD 476‚Äì1400) During this era, monks were known for having gardens with herbs and wildflowers. In the later part of the Gothic period flowers reached a more dominant role, such as flowers beginning to blossom in altar pictures, manuscripts, and paintings. An important aspect of the monastery plan was to include a medicinal herb garden, which would ‚Äúfurnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. A dependence on the power of herbs without reference to their Creator [God] was, however, regarded as improper for a Christian‚Äù. Because God ‚Äúcauses herbs to grow,‚Äù their medical utility is fundamentally spiritual. In addition, many plants were used by monks and Christians in general in sacred rituals and ceremonies. They often had associations appealing to spiritual bases as well as to medicinal effects. Renaissance (1400‚Äì1600) The flower design started in Italy and grew through Europe. Paintings of impressive floral arrangements in vases were popular. In the paintings, fruit blossoms and leaves were woven into garlands to decorate walls and vaulted ceilings, and petals were piled into baskets or strewn on the floors, streets, or allowed to float down from balconies. Baroque (1600‚Äì1775) At the beginning of this period floral designs were symmetrical and oval-shaped, with asymmetric crescents and S-shapes becoming popular later on. Flemish arrangements (1600‚Äì1750) The baroque arrangements in the Dutch- Flemish style were more compact and proportioned. Their major characteristic was the variety of flowers within the bouquet. French arrangements (1600‚Äì1814) During the French Baroque period, a soft, almost fragile appeal became a major characteristic of floral design. Arrangements were asymmetrical using the C-crescent or the S-shape. In the empire period they used simple lines in triangle shapes and strong color contrast. The typical empire design would be arranged in an urn containing an abundance of large richly colored flowers. Georgian arrangements (1714‚Äì1760) The designs in this period were formal and symmetrical and often tightly arranged with a variety of flowers. Oriental design became influential due to active trading. At the end of the period the designs became more informal due to the fact that the fragrance of the flowers, which were believed to rid the air of diseases, became more important. Small, handheld arrangements called nosegays or tussie-mussies were used to carry sweet scents, and also helped mask the odors of society where bathing was often believed to be unhealthy. Victorian arrangements (1820‚Äì1901) Flowers were considered fashionable in this period. Large mass flowers were placed tightly into containers to create compact arrangements that were asymmetrical and stacked tightly. There was no definite style, but many different flowers and colours made the arrangement look almost unplanned. The tussie-mussie bouquets were still serving to eliminate odors. At the end of this period attempts were made to set up rules for a proper arranging of flowers, which is when it became an artful skill or profession in Europe. The Italian Renaissance helped to give an extra spark to the art of flower arranging in Europe. It was during this time period that a wide variety of arrangement styles began to develop. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flower arrangements were commonplace and a wide variety of materials were used to make containers, including marble, heavy Venetian glass, and bronze. Flower arrangements made during this time introduced a whole new element ‚Äì the usage of tropical fruits. These arrangements also focused on creating colour contrast. Some of the popular flowers included the Lilium Candidum (or Madonna Lily, used as a symbol for fertility and chastity), narcissus, pinks, iris, jasmine, pansies, French marigolds, cornflowers, and rosemary.

Sanctuary attacked Rathlin Island was used as a sanctuary because of its natural defences and rocky shores; when the wind blew from the west, in earlier times it was almost impossible to land. It was also respected as a hiding place, as it was the one-time abode of St. Columba. Installing themselves in Rathlin Castle, the MacDonnells of Antrim made Rathlin their base for resistance to the Enterprise of Ulster. Their military leader, Sorley Boy MacDonnell (Scottish Gaelic: Somhairle Buidhe Mac Domhnaill) and other Scots had thought it prudent to send their wives, children, elderly, and sick to Rathlin Island for safety. Acting on the instructions of Sir Henry Sidney and the Earl of Essex, Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norreys took the castle by storm. Drake used two cannons to batter the castle and when the walls gave in, Norreys ordered direct attack on 25 July, and the Garrison surrendered. Norreys set the terms of surrender, whereupon the constable, his family, and one of the hostages were given safe passage and all other defending soldiers were killed, and on 26 July 1575, Norreys' forces hunted the old, sick, very young and women who were hiding in the caves. Despite the surrender, they killed all the 200 defenders and more than 400 civilian men, women and children. Drake was also charged with the task of preventing any Scottish reinforcement vessels reaching the Island. The entire family of Sorley Boy MacDonnell perished in the massacre. Essex, who ordered the killings, boasted in a letter to Francis Walsingham, the Queen's secretary and spymaster, that Sorley Boy MacDonnell watched the massacre from the mainland helplessly and was \\"like to run mad from sorrow\\". Aftermath Norreys stayed on the island and tried to rebuild the walls of the castle so that the English might use the structure as a fortress. As Drake was not paid to defend the island, he departed with his ships. Norreys realised that it was not possible to defend the island without intercepting Scottish galleys and he returned to Carrickfergus in September 1575.

The prison dates from 1785; it is infamous for the treatment of its political inmates, especially during the Communist regime. In Romanian slang the generic word for a prison is \\"gherl«é\\", after the institution.  History  =Early years= The basic structure came from the fortress of Gherla or \\"Szamos-uj-var\\" (equivalent to transliteration from Hungarian, meaning \\"New castle on the Szamos\\") built around 1540 by George Martinuzzi, archbishop, cardinal and Imperial Treasurer of the Habsburg Empire. Through the Imperial Decree of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, dated October 20, 1785 this fortress was transformed into \\"Carcer Magni Principatus Transilvanie\\" (i.e.: The Major Prison of Transylvanian Principality). Throughout its history under the Austrian Empire, then Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary and finally Romania the penitentiary also hosted various industrial activities. Near the prison a large cemetery holds the bodies of many inmates, including S√°ndor R√≥zsa, a well-known local \\"Robin Hood\\". =Communist era= Detail from the Icon of the New Martyrs of the Romanian Land (at Diacone»ôti Monastery in AgƒÉ»ô), showing political detainees being tortured at Gherla Prison Many Romanian military officers who had initially fought against the Soviet Army in World War II were incarcerated in Gherla Prison by the Communist regime after the end of the war. Many of the anti-Communist opposition figures spent jail time or disappeared forever into this prison. Gherla Prison has a very large underground area. During the 1960s it was reported that the prison was housing over 15,000 inmates. According to a study done by the International Centre for Studies into Communism, 20.3% of all political prisoners in Communist Romania did some time at Gherla Prison. The prison (called by the locals the \\"Yellow House\\") was very imposing. To the south was a cemetery, and next to it, a smaller one, for detainees dying at the prison. The fortress was surrounded by a 4-meter high wall, topped by several watchtowers with armed soldiers on guard. Next to the wall was a 3-meter wide space, fenced with a 2-meter high barbed wire fence. At the front entrance was the one-story administration building, and from this building, through a vaulted door, one reached the two courtyards, paved with stones. The main building had two entrances, one to the inner courtyard and the other to the workshop courtyard; the inner courtyard had a gate to the south leading to the workshops. In June 1958 a group of prisoners‚Äîconsisting mostly of young men who had tried to escape to Yugoslavia, and had either been caught or returned to Romania‚Äîrebelled, asking for a more humane treatment. The disturbance was quickly put down by the authorities, and the rebellious inmates were subjected to terrible beatings and torture. In an interview with AdevƒÉrul, an ex-detainee, Constantin Vlasie, recounts how the guards at Gherla Prison \\"were evil. They made us eat feces, we slept on the floor, they beat our feet until we fainted.\\" He went on: \\"They wanted to break up our morale. They had evil methods to make us renounce our faith and worship them instead.\\" Another ex-prisoner, Mihai StƒÉuceanu (arrested for being a border-jumper), recalls: \\"The detention regime at Gherla was probably very similar to the extermination regime applied in the Nazi camps: 10 to 12 hours of physical work on a construction site, which was cordoned off with double fences of barbed-wire and with guarding towers, exactly like those to be found at the border.\\" = Current use = The penitentiary is in service today as a \\"Maximum Security Penitentiary\\". It also houses a museum, which opened in 1997. Notable inmates This is a partial list of notable inmates of Gherla Prison; the symbol ‚Ä† indicates those who died there.

Smart was conversing with his friend, John N. Hurty, in Hurty's Indianapolis drugstore. Hurty brought up the idea that it would be a good idea for Purdue University (founded 14 years earlier) to offer courses to train students as pharmacists. It is said that Smart agreed, and would fight for the establishment of a pharmacy school at Purdue as long as Hurty served as professor for at least two years. Hurty accepted, and in September 1884, classes began with seven students. Hurty was well- qualified for the position. Having completed courses at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, Indianapolis College of Pharmacy (acquired by Butler University in 1904), attended lectures at Jefferson Medical College in 1872, and graduated from the Medical College of Indiana (acquired by Indiana University in 1908) in 1881, his background was likely influential in establishing the scientific rigor that characterized the new curriculum (at the time, a unique quality in pharmacy education).Eckles, RB (1979).

To this date, no public attributions of any archaeological or cultural importance have been made to the site, despite its well-known prehistorical importance. The Cross = Controversy = The cross that stands on top of Table Rock has had a volatile history over the last years. The controversy began in 1956, when the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees) built the cross on what was then Department of Correction land. At the time, the Department of Correction owned a tract that included the bluff of Table Rock. In 1970, the Jaycees submitted a request to the Board of Correction on June 10 for the purchase a parcel of land that would surround the land around the cross. A rear view of the cross, which is illuminated nightly by inset LEDs On June 25, 1971, the Correction Board deemed the desired land surplus and turned it over to the Idaho Department of Lands. Idaho Board of Land Commissioners records reveal that because the requested land was on the very edge of Table Rock‚Äôs ledge, the Board of Correction did not feel it would negatively impact the surrounding state owned land. Sale of the land was the responsibility of the Land Board. In November 1971, an auction was held for the sale of the land with the appraised price of one hundred dollars. The sale of the land was advertised in the Idaho Statesman, Boise's daily newspaper, weekly for six weeks. The Jaycees and a man named Paul Kimball signed up as bidders, though Kimball did not place a bid. The land was sold to the Jaycees for $100, and the cross has been considered to be on private property. On December 16, 1994, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) penned a letter to the Land Board asserting the sale of the parcel of land was both unconstitutional and a violation of state law. The letter stated the Land Board had taken the liberty of refusing bids other than the Jaycee‚Äôs. It also accused the Land Board of restricting media coverage, which they claimed had left the general public in the dark. In March 1995, Land Board members voted and rejected the ACLU‚Äôs request to void the sale. Controversy escalated in November 1999, when (self-described) atheist human rights activist Rob Sherman gave a speech at BSU claiming the Jaycees were a ‚Äúbunch of criminals‚Äù and threatened action to bring the cross down. The dispute resulted in over 10,000 participating in a march from the Boise Depot to the Statehouse to save the Table Rock cross. The final cross is 4,500 pounds, 6 stories tall, and contains 2,600 LED lights. The cross sits 3,629 feet above sea level. = Building the Cross = The idea for putting the cross on Table Rock came from a TV program titled \\"This Is Your Life\\". The Jaycees asked volunteers to build the cross. The Jaycees club's original goal in building the cross was to promote Christianity as well as taking a stand against communism in the mid 1950s. $880 was raised to fund the project. Dick Wilcolm, Rich Jordan, and Chet Sawyer were the three volunteers that dug the hole and placed the cross in the ground. The original cross required $60 a month to power the lights that illuminated the cross, however in 2011 the lights were changed to LED lights, cutting the price down to $20.

It is within the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow. History Hillhead expanded rapidly during the second half of the 19th century, especially following the relocation of the University of Glasgow to Gilmorehill in the 1870s. The Church of Scotland responded by constructing a temporary church in a field in front of what is now Athole Gardens in Hillhead. This corrugated iron church was opened in 1871. The congregation soon outgrew the temporary building and a decision to construct a permanent church was taken. Finding a suitable site was problematic, partly due to old mineworkings, but the new church was opened on 8 October 1876. At first, the congregation operated under the supervision of the Kirk Session of Govan Old Parish Church, but in 1882 became a \\"quoad sacra\\" parish with its own Kirk Session (i.e. a parish for church purposes, but not a civil parish for local government purposes). Other churches were also constructed nearby. These included Belmont Church, which united with Hillhead Parish Church in 1950. In 1978, Belmont and Hillhead Parish Church united with Kelvinside (Botanic Gardens) Church, becoming Kelvinside Hillhead Parish Church (and using the old Hillhead Parish Church buildings in Observatory Road). After standing derelict for four years, the former Kelvinside Parish Church (Botanic Gardens), was converted into the \\"√íran M√≥r\\" restaurant, entertainment and music venue, which opened in 2004. The refurbishment features a ceiling designed by the Glaswegian writer and artist Alasdair Gray. Building The building was designed by the architect James Sellar and completed in 1876. It is modelled on the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. The church is located in Observatory Road, Hillhead. It is a Category A listed building.

History The idea of forming a Society to propagate Buddhism in Germany and other western countries dawned on Asoka Weeraratna, then a young businessman dealing in jewellery and Swiss wristwatches, while he was on his first business visit to Germany in 1951. Asoka Weeraratna became aware of the spiritual hunger in Germany, which was slowly recovering from total devastation due to the Second World War, and the search for an alternative moral and spiritual philosophy, that placed a very high emphasis on peace and non-violence. On his return from West Germany and convinced of the potential for growth of Buddhism in that country, Weeraratna established the Lanka Dhammaduta Society on 21 September 1952, which was later renamed the German Dharmaduta Society (GDS). Ven. √ë√¢natiloka Mah√¢thera, the well known German Scholar monk was the first Patron of the Society. In 1953, Weeraratna, by this time the Honorary Secretary of the Society, on his second visit to Germany, made a survey of Buddhist activities in that country and published his investigations in a report entitled 'Buddhism in Germany'. The Society in 1954 launched the Million Rupee Fund under the patronage of Dudley Senanayake, the former Prime Minister, to collect funds for the permanent establishment of the Buddha S√¢sana in Germany, as Arahant Mahinda had done it in Sri Lanka. With growing public support, the Society soon won the recognition and encouragement of the State and the Million Rupee Fund was declared an Approved Charity by the Government. Among the many benefactors who contributed to this Fund, particular mention must be made of Walther Schmits, a German Buddhist, who left a valuable legacy of DM 550.000 to the Society. In 1955 the Government granted to the Society an acre of vacant crown land in Bullers Road, Colombo on a 99-year-old lease. In August 1956, Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Prime Minister, declared open at a ceremonial public meeting, amidst a large gathering, the newly built Headquarters and Training Centre of the Society at 417, Bullers Road (Bauddhaloka Mawatha), Colombo 7 consisting of a two-storied dormitory of 14 rooms, an Assembly Hall, Office and Library, built at a cost of Rs. 125.000. Eight prominent Buddhist monks led by the German monk Ven. √ë√¢natiloka Mah√¢thera and including Ven. Balangoda √Çnanda Maitreyya, Ven. Galle Anuruddha, Ven. Akuretiye Amaravamsa, Ven. √ë√¢naponika (German), Ven. Kudawella Vang√Æsa and Ven. Vappo (German) were attached to the Centre. These monks offered their services to train German Buddhists and others in the study of Buddhist Philosophy. Friedrich M√∂ller, a teacher from Hamburg and the first German recruit of the Society, arrived in Sri Lanka in 1953. He completed his period of training and received ordination under the name of Bhikkhu √ë√¢navimala. The Society sponsored the first Buddhist Mission to Germany, which left the Colombo Harbour by ship SS Orantes on June 15, 1957. The three monks in this historic mission comprised Ven. Soma, Ven. Kheminda and Ven. Vin√Æta. They were all recruited from the Vajiraramaya Temple, Bambalapitiya. A few weeks later Asoka Weeraratna left Colombo by airplane and joined this Mission in Germany. He spent about five months in Germany and was able to purchase Das Buddhistische Haus from the heirs of its founder, Dr. Paul Dahlke.Report in Milwaukee Sentinel, September 10, 1957 This Buddhist Haus was built in 1923 and considered the center of German Buddhism during Dr. Dahlke's time. After its 1957 purchase it was converted into a Buddhist Vih√¢ra by the Society by providing residential facilities to Buddhist Dharmaduta monks drawn mainly from Sri Lanka. Since 1957 there has been a stream of Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka and other countries, taking up residence in the Berlin Buddhist Vih√¢ra. Of these dedicated monks, special mention must be made of Ven. Athurugiriye √ë√¢navimala Mah√¢thera who served as the Vih√¢radhipati of the Berlin Vih√¢ra for a period of 15 years (1966‚Äì1981). These monks teach the Buddha Dharma and give instruction on meditation to Germans and people of other nationalities seeking a philosophy that places an emphasis on self-reliance, non violence and loving kindness to all living beings. Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi who visited the Berlin Vih√¢ra in May 2002 and was impressed with the self-sacrificing work of the resident monks and lay volunteers has said in a Message of Goodwill to the GDS on the occasion of the commemoration of its 50th anniversary (1952‚Äì2002) that: References External links * The de/startseite/49-pressearchiv/pressearchiv- englisch/93-the-spread-of-buddhism-in-germany-ny-times-2001 The Spread of Buddhism in Germany * Das Buddhistische Haus - Official Website * Promoting Buddhism in Europe by Ven.

Kaufman and Ring Lardner. Based on the Lardner short story \\"Some Like Them Cold,\\" about a love affair that loses steam before it ever gets started, it includes songs with words and music by Lardner but is not considered a musical per se. Synopsis At the center of June Moon is Fred Stevens, a young aspiring lyricist who journeys from Schenectady to New York City, where he hopes to make a name for himself in the world of song publishing and night clubs. On the train he meets dental assistant Edna Baker, and the two embark upon a friendship that evolves into love for her and fondness for him. While struggling to become a Tin Pan Alley notable, Fred takes a shine to his composer partner Paul's glamorous, gold- digging sister-in-law Eileen. The two men sell a song to a music publisher and it develops into a hit.

It is located in Lalgudi taluk. The nearest large village is Poovalur.Both side have two lakes, northside of village have two river passing, south part have rice or sugarcan cultivation.. Economy The major occupation in the village is agriculture, mainly sugarcane and rice. The land is fertile throughout the year. History  The village may have originated in the 15th or 17th centuries, although the exact date is unknown. The Chalukya emperors, who ruled this region of India, called for war against the Pallavas. The Chalukyas attained victory. The Salukyas then decided to wage war against the Cholazs Empire, which administered the village and surrounding areas. At this time, the Cholazs Empire extended from Indonesia to Sri Lanka and its rulers were reluctant to conduct war in northern India. The Cholazs had well-trained soldiers and more than 5,000 war elephants. Nevertheless, the Chalukyas defeated them, even though they lacked an equal elephant army. The Pallavas then decided to wage war on the Salukyas to reclaim their autonomy. The Pallavas, expecting the Chalukya army, camped in \\"Palla puram\\" (the namesake of Palla puram). The Chalukyas encamped in Vellanur village. The armies clashed in Peruvalanallur, along the Pullambadi Canal. The fighting lasted 14 to 18 days and is one of the longest wars in Tamil Nadu history, with many soldiers killed on both sides. Finally, the Palla secured the victory and recovered their autonomy. Some stone culvert remnants date from this period, located in a cremation ground along Vellanur road near Teppakulam and the Trichy-Ariyalur main road in Peruvala Nallur. A sword that may be a remnant of the war has been discovered by a pallar community village farmer in his field.  Emigration  In the last 8-10 years, residents have been moving out of the village to Trichy, a large city with better job opportunities in non-agricultural industries. Because of this, the village's population is quite low, and agricultural production has fallen.

This places the boundary roughly along the Panama-Colombia border. Other definitions place the boundary at the lowest natural crossing of the Isthmus of Panama near the Panama Canal, or along the canal itself.

Outside North America, the theme parks were also available in several countries, notably in the United Kingdom, China, India, Gabon, and even Australia, which was part of Australia's Wonderland, which is now defunct. Hanna-Barbera Land was also opened in Houston, Texas. The sections contained in the KECO Entertainment-owned parks was retained when their parent park, except the one in Australia, was bought by Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western, and later acquired by Viacom), then the parent of Paramount Pictures, which changed the name of the parks by adding \\"Paramount's\\" in front of their names. The park in Australia was not purchased by Paramount and was sold to a local company. KECO Entertainment was renamed into Paramount Parks in 1994, around the time of the Viacom purchase, and remained in existence until 2006. As part of the 2005 Viacom split, ownership of Paramount Parks was transferred to the CBS Corporation. CBS then sold the parks to the Sandusky, Ohio-based amusement park management company Cedar Fair Entertainment Company on June 30, 2006. As an effect of absorption of Hanna-Barbera into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001, the parks have largely removed or rebranded the areas into other children's sections by either the Nickelodeon brand and/or the Warner Bros. brand. Current Hanna-Barbera theme parks are Bedrock City in South Dakota; the park with the same name in Arizona; and Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Campground. History of involvement in theme parks Taft Broadcasting purchased Hanna- Barbera Productions, a television animation studio, in 1967. Two years later, it purchased Cincinnati's Coney Island amusement park, moving it and expanding it on a larger allotment of land, reopening it in 1972 as Kings Island. The company partnered with Top Value Enterprises to create Family Leisure Centers in 1973, opening Virginia's Kings Dominion in 1975; the company purchased Carowinds the same year. In 1979, Taft purchased 20% of the new Canada's Wonderland theme park in Toronto, Canada, which opened in 1981. The year prior, Family Entertainment Centers was dissolved, making Taft the sole owner of Kings Dominion. By 1984, a grouping of senior executives from Taft's Amusement Park Group and some park managers purchased Taft's theme park division. The group named the resulting company Kings Entertainment Company (KECO). Taft gave KECO a perpetual license to use Hanna-Barbera characters at all of their current parks. Australia's Wonderland, which opened in 1985, also licensed the characters, but 1989 KECO purchase Great America did not opt to receive the license, or opt to separately license. In their first year of incorporation, KECO opened a short-lived Hanna-Barbera Land in Houston, Texas. The Kings Entertainment Company theme parks all had Hanna-Barbera sections, some having The Flintstones sections, and Smurf sections, after the popularity of the 1980s television series The Smurfs. Through the years, these parks have largely removed or re-branded the areas into other children's sections (under the Nickelodeon brand and the Paramount Parks-created name \\"KidZVille\\"). Any of the still operating parks are part of Cedar Fair Entertainment Company; Australia's Wonderland and the stand-alone Hanna-Barbera Land parks are both defunct. =Big hopes for motion-controlled attraction= In October 1989, animated film producer David Kirschner became Hanna-Barbera's president and CEO; Hanna-Barbera was part of the publicly traded Great American Broadcasting Company. He set out to make the company an entertainment conglomerate to rival Disney, by utilizing its existing core characters. Recognizing the Hanna- Barbera parks needed rejuvenation, he had the company create The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera, a motion simulation-ride. Created to be one of Universal Studios Florida's original attractions, The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera cost between $13 and $14 million, and opened June 7, 1990. They also opened a concept store at the exit to the attraction, for a chain of Hanna-Barbera stores they hoped to open. The attraction operated for 12 years, until it was closed October 20, 2002, to make room for Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast. Hanna-Barbera Land Hanna‚ÄìBarbera Land was a theme park based on the cartoons of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio. It was located in the Spring CDP of unincorporated Harris County, Texas, United States, north of Houston. It was opened in the 1984 and 1985 seasons. The park was built under the guise of Taft Broadcasting, which became the Kings Entertainment Company as of the opening. Kings also owned the Australia's Wonderland, Canada's Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island theme parks. Despite increased attendance in 1985, a bad regional economy and minimal spending in the park on concessions, gift shop purchases and souvenirs meant a death knell for the attraction. Hanna‚ÄìBarbera Land was sold to private investors and SplashTown USA was built in its place, then again to Bryant Morris, then to Six Flags, who purchased the park in 1999. After initially not wanting to brand the park and calling it \\"a member of the Six Flags family\\", Six Flags eventually decided to re-brand the park as Six Flags SplashTown. In 2007, the park was sold to PARC Management who continues to operate the site. Hanna- Barbera's Marineland As sections of larger parks =Canada's Wonderland= Hanna-Barbera Land opened in 1981 with three sections. The first section was Yogi's Woods, based on The Yogi Bear Show, which featured the attractions Balloon Race, Yogi's Cave, Boo Boo's Buggies and the Woodland Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre). Scoobyville was the central town site, where a carousel and other attractions were included. On the opposite end of Scoobyville from Yogi's Woods was Bedrock, based on The Flintstones. Saltwater Circus was also in the section. In 1984, Smurf Village replaced Yogi's Woods; the section featured the newly-popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon The Smurfs. A walk-through attraction, Smurf Village closed at the end of the 1992 season. For the 1993 season, the Smurf Village section of the park became Kids Kingdom. In 1998, KidZVille replaced the Kids Kingdom and its two rides, the \\"Kid's Castle Playland\\" and the \\"Jumbo Bumps\\" were renamed \\"The Candy Factory\\" and the \\"Twizzler Twist\\" (and renamed again the next year to \\"Sour Cherry Blaster Twist\\"). Along with five new rides for KidZVille, \\"The Busy Little Town\\" was launched and it included the characters from Nickelodeon's Rugrats series. The Playhouse Theatre still had a Hanna-Barbera themed show, Scooby Doo's Scary School Daze. On slower days, the Scooby-Doo walkaround character may venture through this section of the park. The Bedrock section of the park met its end soon after, being replaced by Nickelodeon Central in 2003. Only the bumper cars were kept, turned into the Rugrats Toonpike. The restaurant was de-themed and turned into a Pizza Pizza. In 2010, Hanna-Barbera Land was replaced with Planet Snoopy. =Carowinds= Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera (1975-?) In 1984, Carowinds added Smurf Island, which was a children's play area located on the 1.3-acre (5,300 m2) island surrounded by the Carolina Sternwheeler. Access to Smurf Island was gained in one of two ways ‚Äì across the Carolina Sternwheeler and a ramp built on the island side of the boat, or on diesel-powered \\"Smurf Boats\\" launched from the area beside Harmony Hall. Children could enjoy two ball crawls and a climbing area complete with ropes, cargo nets, wood platforms, a rope tunnel and a 60-foot (18 m) tubular slide. Smurf characters roamed the island and led guests to the hidden Smurf village with four Smurf houses that children could enter. Smurf Island was eventually closed and later demolished to make space for the BORG Assimilator, a Star Trek-themed flying roller coaster. The Borg coaster is still operating today, but the theming was removed in 2008 and the name was changed to Nighthawk. =California's Great America= Opening in 1987, Smurf Woods featured a pint- sized steel coaster, the Blue Streak (now called Woodstock Express), as well as a Smurf village with mushroom houses. Smurf Woods was closed in 1995 and replaced with Nickelodeon Splat City. One Smurf house survived and can be seen in the Picnic Grove area. The area was renamed Planet Snoopy in 2010. =Six Flags Great America= Also, an area known as Camp Cartoon Network opened in 1998. It was a sub-section of the park's Yukon Territory. The rides were themed to Hanna-Barbera properties that aired in reruns on Cartoon Network at the time rather than original Cartoon Network programming (despite characters such as Johnny Bravo, Cow & Chicken, and Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory, appearing on the sign).https://jimvid.smugmug.com/Amusement-Park/Six-Flags- Great-America-61705/i-JDHM3Gj/ Photo of the Camp Cartoon Network sign circa 2005 In 2006, the area was renamed to simply Camp Cartoon, and the original CN characters were removed from the sign.https://sfgamworld.com/rides/kidsrides.php Photos of the area re-branded Camp Cartoon Starting in 2018, the area was gradually re-themed to remove all Hanna-Barbera intellectual properties.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poPc3DZAvs8 YouTube video showing Camp Cartoon partway through re-theming in April 2018 =Kings Dominion= The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera (1975‚Äì1997) The earlier Land of the Dooz Mine Train attraction became Smurf Mountain. It was eventually closed to make room for the popular Volcano: The Blast Coaster in 1998. =Kings Island= When Kings Island opened in 1972, one of its original themed areas was The Happy Land of Hanna Barbera. Original attractions included: * Scooby-Doo, a wooden roller coaster; it was renamed the Beastie in 1980 and Fairly Odd Coaster in 2006. It is now known as the Woodstock Express. * Enchanted Voyage (1972-1983) * Winnie Witch's Cauldrons (1972‚Äì1991) * Gulliver's Rub-A-Dub (1972‚Äì1982) * Boo-Boo's Buggies (1972‚Äì1991) * Boo-Boo's Baggage Claim (1972‚Äì2005) * Jetson's Jet Orbiters (1972‚Äì2005) * Baba Looey's Buggies (1972‚Äì2005) Additionally, the parking lot featured a combination of a Hanna-Barbera character and a number to help guests remember their location at the end of the day. Flintstone's Boulder Bumpers was added to the park in 1977. The 1977 park season wrapped with the Peanut Olympics, between teams led by Billy Carter, United States President Carter's younger brother, and Yogi Bear. The two-day event was won by Carter. For the park's 10th anniversary in 1982, it expanded Hanna-Barbera Land, spending $2.1 million on the new attractions. Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera attended the media preview on Monday, April 9 at 10 am. The new attractions were: * Yogi's Picnic, a live show * the Woodland Theatre, with a puppet show * Gumball Alley * Hanna-Barbera Character Carousel * a Hanna-Barbera Character Fountain * climbing structures Shaggy's Silly Sticks and McScrappy's Farm * Fool House * Scooby Choo * Jelly Bean Bowlhttp://www.kiextreme.com/history_timeline.php The Enchanted Voyage ride was closed in 1983, to be retrofitted to the upcoming Smurfs television series. \\"The Smurfs' Enchanted Voyage\\" debuted in 1984, while the television series was popular. People would ride in a boat around the world of the Smurfs celebrating the seasons of winter, fall, summer and spring. The Flying Carpet slide was moved to Hanna-Barbera Land in 1986, becoming Scrappy's Slide. Five rides were added to Hanna-Barbera Land in 1992. In 1994, Sunshine Turnpike was closed, to give more room for a new children's area.http://www.kiextreme.com/history_defunct.php The Hanna-Barbera attraction received competition in 1995, from a \\"Nickelodeon Splat City\\" section. The park was purchased by Paramount Parks in 1992 and a $750,000 upgrade was made to the section; new attractions were the Enchanted Theatre, Scooby Zoom, Pixie and Dixie's Swingset and Dick Dastardly's Biplanes. Additionally, the Smurfs Enchanted Voyage was retrofitted for $3.5 million, into the Phantom Theatre. In 1998, Scooby's Ghoster Coaster (their second Scooby-Doo-themed coaster), Yogi's Skytours and Atom Ant's Airways were added to the park; Scooby Zoom was renamed Top Cat's Taxi Jam and Flintstone Flybots turned into Jetson's Jet Orbiters. Nickelodeon Central was added to the park in 2001, taking over parts of Parts of Rivertown and Hanna-Barbera Land. For seven years in a row, 2001‚Äì2008, the collective kids area at the park has received Amusement Today magazine's \\"Golden Ticket for Best Kids' Area in the World in 2007\\". The area was removed at the end of the 2005 season, to make way for Nickelodeon Universe, featuring 18 \\"new\\" rides. Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Castle was the only ride to remain as-is, having been created in 2003 as a complete overhaul of the existing Phantom Theater ride. The attraction was the park's first interactive ride. The replacement section has SpongeBob SquarePants- and Dora the Explorer-themed neighbourhoods and 18 attractions. * Atom Ant's Airways is now Timmy's Airtours * Yogi's Sky Tours is now LazyTown Sportacopters * Top Cat's Taxi Jam is now Little Bill's Giggle Coaster * Pixie and Dixie's Swingset is now Backyardigans Swing-Along * Dick Dastardly's Biplanes is now Blue's Skidoo * Hanna Barbera Carousel is now Nick-O-Round * Quick Draw's Railway is now La Adventura de Azul * Flintstone's Boulder Bumpers is now Jimmy Neutron's Atom Smasher * Fender Bender 500 is now Nick Jr. Drivers * Scooby Doo/Beastie is now Fairly Odd Coaster * Huck's Hotrods is now Go Diego Go * Alley Cat 500 is now Swiper's Sweepers Shows with H-B characters * 1984: The Smurfs Are Here (International Showplace) * 1985: Song of the Smurfs (International Showplace) * 1986: The Curse of Gargamel (International Showplace) * 1987: Yogi's Funtastic Machine (International Showplace) =Wonderland Sydney= Hanna-Barbera Land (1985‚Äì2002) at Australia's Wonderland (later named Wonderland Sydney) was largely based on the layout of the Canada's Wonderland park's section. =Small Flintstones parks= * Bedrock City in Custer, South Dakota (1966‚Äì2015) * Bedrock City in Valle, Arizona (1972‚Äì2019) * Bedrock City in Kelowna, British Columbia (1970s‚Äì1998) * Bedrock City / Dinotown in Chilliwack, British Columbia (1975‚Äì1994) * Calaway Park in Springbank, Alberta Attractions =Scooby's Gasping Ghoster Coaster= It was a prototype Caripo Batflyer suspended roller coaster (billed as the first suspended coaster for kids). The ride had poor capacity and roughness complaints. It was removed in 2005 as a part of the Hanna-Barbera Land retheming at Kings Island For Nickelodeon Universe. However, the attraction using the same name in the city of Doswell, Virginia and in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada was kept its name until 2010 when the Canadian version was renamed into simply the Ghoster Coaster. In Doswell, Virginia, although the name was also simplified, the usual Scooby-Doo theme was kept. =Scooby-Doo= Themed to Scooby-Doo, it was opened together with Kings Island in 1972. The second one was opened in 1974 at Kings Dominion, prior to the park's official 1975 opening. It was also opened in Carowinds. Paying homage to The Beast after its successful launch in 1979, a tunnel was added to the bottom of the first drop for the 1980 season, and the Kings Island version was renamed \\"the Beastie\\". When those two parks were under the ownership of Viacom, they started to add areas themed to the Nickelodeon television channel. In 2005, during the process of re-branding of the roller coaster as the Fairly Odd Coaster, the wooden superstructure was painted indigo and the cars repainted to mimic the characters Cosmo and Wanda from The Fairly OddParents; one train pink and the other green, with the fairies' faces on the front of the cars. To depict these characters as roller coaster trains is accurate to the television show because on screen, the fairies can change their shape at will, though their faces always remain visible on whatever they become. The same thing was done to the Kings Island version a year later. Ironically, Cedar Fair purchased both of those parks, as well as the three other parks that were owned by Viacom. Cedar Fair then decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes from the kids area in time for the start of the 2010 season. = Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster = Unusually, this attraction is a Wild Mouse roller coaster. It is not located at any of the former Paramount Parks altogether. It was built in 2002 and located in Warner Bros. Movie World in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. = The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera = = Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion = This attraction was Carowinds, Kings Dominion, Kings Island and Canada's Wonderland's take on the traditional dark ride. On this ride, the scenes feature ghosts and monsters that riders shoot at using laser-outfitted guns. Riders in consecutive cars compete with each other to see who can shoot the most ghosts. In the United Kingdom, it was called Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Castle. It was possibly themed to the TV show What's New, Scooby-Doo?. The ride was re-themed on November 27, 2009, to remove the Scooby-Doo characters. The move is part of the park's broader move away from Hanna-Barbera characters. It became Boo Blasters on Boo Hill, a shooting dark ride themed to a large ghost. = Baba Looey's Buggies = It is located in the South Pie section of Hanna-Barbera Land, these were simple handcars on a track. The Kings Island version was removed to make way for the Nickelodeon Universe expansion. = Jetson's Jet Orbiters = It can be found currently in Movie Park Germany and also in Warner Bros. Movie World Australia. It was seen in Kings Island until 2005 due to the makeover to Nick Universe. It was known as a legal successor to the Flintstone Flybots and themed to The Jetsons. = McScrappy's Slide = This was a giant slide originally called the Flying Carpet Slide, which was moved from Coney Island to the spot where Zephyr is today. It was later relocated to Hanna-Barbera Land for the 1986 season (about where Flying Ace Aerial Chase is today) and renamed McScrappy's Slide. The attraction was removed indefinitely in 1995 to make way for the addition of Nickelodeon Splat City. = Attractions themed to Top Cat = Two attractions themed to the TV show Top Cat, named Top Cat's Taxi Jam and the Alley Cat 500, were located in Kings Island and Kings Dominion. Rumors said that the Alley Cat 500 was the predecessor to the Swiper's Sweepers, which closed permanently in 2010 when Cedar Fair decided to remove all remaining Hanna-Barbera and Nickelodeon themes in time for the start of the 2010 season. Top Cat's Taxi Jam was the successor of Scooby Zoom. From 2006 to 2010, it was known as Little Bill's Giggle Coaster. It was succeeded by the Great Pumpkin Coaster, which was introduced on September 8, 2009. = Other attractions = No attractions themed to Tom and Jerry appeared in all of the former Paramount Parks and the now-defunct Wonderland Sydney, although a promotion advertisement with Tom Cat holding a sign was shown in Canada's Wonderland prior to 2009. In addition, several attractions themed to The Flintstones also appear in theme parks in Abu Dhabi, and South Africa. Attractions associated with DC Comics, although, can be found in every park themed to Warner Bros. The Super Friends shows (and also The Dukes) that were also made by Hanna- Barbera, never appeared altogether in any of the Hanna-Barbera parks - it was always under WB control. Attractions to the shows such as The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory and any other shows that co-produced with Cartoon Network Studios were unavailable in any of the Hanna-Barbera attractions. Also attractions themed to licensed non-Smurfs properties, such as Snorks, Pac-Man and Richie Rich, were also not allowed. Majority attractions, such as those themed to The Jetsons, were usually the dominant attraction in every H-B park. As individual attractions * Universal Studios Florida: In Production Central, characters appearing are Yogi Bear, Boo-Boo Bear, the Flintstones, the Jetsons, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy. In Woody Woodpecker's KidZone, Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, Daphne and Fred appear. * Universal Studios Hollywood: Character photo-ops currently include Scooby-Doo and Shaggy; Fred Flintstone, Barney Rubble, Wilma Flintstone, and Betty Rubble previously appeared.

The dragonflies and damselflies are the only living members of this group, which was far more diverse in the late Paleozoic and contained gigantic species, including the griffinflies (colloquially called \\"giant dragonflies\\", although they were not dragonflies in the strict sense) of the order Protodonata. This lineage dates back at least to the Bashkirian, not quite 320 million years ago. Trueman & Rowe (2008) Systematics and taxonomy There is little consensus about the relationships of the Odonatoptera. What is certain is that they are a clade of winged insects that stands outside the Neoptera. But various authors' analyses have yielded any one of three mutually exclusive phylogenies, or some variant thereof: The least problematic (in a taxonomic sense) view is that the Odonatoptera are the sister taxon of the Ephemeropteroidea (the mayfly lineage), and that the Palaeodictyopteroidea are either their sister taxon or a basal assemblage, all within a monophyletic Palaeoptera. But few recent analyses have supported this. Rather, it seems more and more likely that the Odonatoptera are the sister taxon of the Neoptera, making the \\"Palaeoptera\\" paraphyletic. The third view places the mayfly lineage as sister taxon of the neopterans, with the Odonatoptera as most primitive winged insects; it has seen little support in recent decades however.Maddison (2002), Trueman [2008] While the internal subdivision of this superorder is subject to much dispute and far from resolved, at least the coarser divisions seem to be fairly stable by now. Six orders are generally recognized, as well as two families incertae sedis and a further \\"family\\" that is almost certainly not monophyletic. Ordered from the most ancestral to the most advanced, these are: =Phylogeny= Based on the work of Petruleviƒçius & Gutierrez 2016. In some treatments, the Odonata are expanded to include all these taxa with the exception of the \\"Erasipteridae\\", Geroptera and Protodonata; this group is treated as an unranked clade Odonatoclada in the scheme used here. Where the Odonata are defined loosely, the term Odonatoidea is used instead of \\"Odonatoptera\\".See e.g. Trueman & Rowe (2008) Footnotes References * (2002): Tree of Life Web Project - Pterygota.

They were eligible to compete for the Edmonton Journal Trophy as Western Canadian Intermediate A Champions. History In the 1950s the Kenora Thistles moniker was resurrected by a team that participated in the Thunder Bay Intermediate Hockey League. They also spent time in Manitoba's Big Six Intermediate Hockey League. Kenora is more local to the Winnipeg-based Manitoba Senior Leagues, but were constantly snubbed when applying to join. In with Marathon, Keewatin, Fort Frances, Fort William, and Port Arthur, the Thistles did quite well winning the league in 1953, 1955, 1957, and 1958 and winning the Edmonton Journal Trophy as the top Intermediate team in Western Canada in 1953. In the 1952-53 season, the Thistles won their first ever Thunder Bay district championship and moved on to the Western Canadian championships. In the semi-final, the Thistles met the Manitoba champion Dauphin Kings who they defeated 3-games-to-none with 4-2, 7-3, and 5-4 victories. In the Edmonton Journal Trophy finals, the Thistles met the Alberta champion Ponoka Stampeders. Kenora won game on 7-4, but were blown out 8-1 in game two. The Thistles rebounded and took game three 5-3 and game four 8-4 before Ponoka could respond with a 3-2 win in game five to make the series 3-games-to-2 for Kenora. Game six was another do-or-die game for the Stampeders, but the Thistles were victorious winning the game 5-1 to take the series. As 1953 Intermediate Champions, the Thistles were offered the privilege of competing in the 1954 World Championships but turned it down as they had already committed to a tour of Japan in 1954. From March 24 until April 3, the Kenora Thistles played off against the best Japan had to offer in Osaka and Tokyo. They defeated the Japan College All-Stars 23-1, the \\"All Japan\\" team 5 times (11-2, 4-2, 9-3, 8-2, 12-7), Nikko Electric 17-2, Hokkaido All-Stars 8-1, and the Kanto All-Stars 13-6. In 1955, the Thistles entered the Thunder Bay district championship as the Western representatives in a best- of-5 series against the Marathon Mercurys, North Shore champions. The Thistles destroyed the Mercurys with scores of 6-1, 11-1, and 5-0 to take the series and another Thunder Bay title. In the Edmonton Journal Trophy semi-final, the Thistles met Manitoba's Brandon Wheat Kings in a best-of-5 series. Kenora led the series after game one with a 6-3 win, they lost game two 5-0, but led again after game three with a 4-1 victory. Brandon then, with their backs to the wall, came back to tie the series with a 6-2 win and then took it with a final 5-1 victory in game five. Brandon went on to win the Edmonton Journal Trophy. The 1956 Thunder Bay district semi-final was won over the Thistles by the Fort Frances Canadians 3-games-to-2. The 1957 Thunder Bay district semi- final was between Kenora and the Fort Frances Canadians. Fort Frances took game one 8-5 and Kenora took game two 8-4. Fort Frances took game three, but Kenora came back and won game four 8-2 and game five 3-2 to win the series. In the district final, the Thistles took on the Marathon Mercurys in a best-of-5 series. Kenora won game one 9-0 and then the two teams tied game two 3-3. In game three Kenora won 6-2 and Marathon won game four 5-4 to stay alive. Game five was th clincher for Kenora as they won 4-0 to take a third district title. In the Edmonton Journal Trophy semi-finals, the Thistles were swept 3-games-to-none by Manitoba's Pine Falls Paper Kings (2-1, 7-3, 5-3). In 1958, the Kenora Thistles joined the Ontario-Minnesota Hockey League. In the Thunder Bay district final, they faced the town of Red Rock in a best-of-5 series. The Thistles won 3-games-to-2. In the Western Canadian semi-final, the Thistles played Saskatchewan's Yorkton Millers in a best-of-3 series. Game one was a 4-4 tie, game two was won by Yorkton 4-2, and game three was won by Kenora 4-0. All tied up, the Millers and Thistles tied again in game four 1-1, but game five was won by Kenora 2-0 to win the series 2-games-to-1 with 2 ties. Then the Thistles made their last ever appearance in the Edmonton Journal Trophy finals against Alberta's Olds Elks. Kenora took game one 4-2, but Olds swept the next four games 6-3, 5-3, 4-1, and 7-6 to win the Western Canadian crown. Kenora lost the 1959 Thunder Bay district semi-final to the Fort Frances Canadians 4-games-to-2. In the late 1950s, the Thistles became members of the Minnesota-Ontario Hockey League. This lasted until the early 1960s.

Redshank was a nickname for Scottish mercenaries from the Highlands' Western Isles. They were a prominent feature of Irish armies throughout the 16th century. They were called redshanks because they went dressed in plaids and waded bare-legged through rivers in the coldest weather. An alternative etymology, illustrated by Jamieson by a quote from Sir Walter Scott, is that it referred to the untanned deer leather buskins worn by Highlanders, although Jamieson notes that Scott's source, John Elder of Caithness, actually stated its origin was from their habit of going \\"bare- legged and bare-footed\\".Jamieson (ed), Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language, v2, p.280 The term was not derogatory, as the English were in general impressed with the redshanks' qualities as soldiers. Weapons The redshanks were usually armed alike, principally with bows (the short bow of Scotland and Ireland, rather than the longbow of Wales and England) and, initially, two-handed claymores or Lochaber axes. English observers reported that some Highlanders fighting in Ireland wore chain mail, long obsolete elsewhere.Fforde, The Great Glen, 2011 Later in the period, they may have adopted the targe and single-handed broadsword, a style of weaponry originally fashionable in early 16th-century Spain from where its use could have spread to Ireland.Stevenson, Alasdair MacColla and the Highland Problem in the Seventeenth Century, 1980, p.83 Combined with the use of muskets, this could have influenced the development of what was later referred to as the \\"highland charge\\", a tactic of firing a single coordinated musket volley before closing at a run with sword and targe. Many clan levies, however, would have remained relatively poorly armed. Origins Many redshanks came from the clans of the Hebrides. Others originated from the poorer clans of mainland Scotland. Their presence was, in general, an indication of the politically unsettled conditions in the west of the country during the period, particularly following the breakup of the Lordship of the Isles at the end of the 15th century.Stevenson, Scottish Covenanters and Irish Confederates, 1981, p.4 Other than the Clan Donald, who had furnished Irish lords with soldiers in earlier times under the Gallowglass system, the men were mostly drawn from the clans of MacLeod, MacQuarrie, MacLean, Campbell, and MacKay,Falls, Elizabeth's Irish Wars, p.79 and were often drawn to contract themselves out due to poverty and overpopulation in their home areas. There are records of men of other clans being hired, such as in 1564 when Somhairle Buidhe Mac Domhnaill procured a group of MacGregors, led by their chief, for a season's campaigning in Ulster.Lenman, England's Colonial Wars 1550-1688, 2014, p.51 A further source of manpower was the tenantry of the MacDonnells of Antrim, recent Hebridean settlers in north-eastern Ireland. Their first recorded use was in 1428, when Niall Garbh √ì Domhnaill imported a large force of Scots mercenaries to assist in the siege of Carrickfergus Castle.Duffy (ed) Medieval Ireland: an Encyclopedia, 2005, p.554 Unlike the gallowglass, who were hired for long periods of service, were generally settled in Ireland and paid in land and beef, the redshanks were hired for the summer months, often on three month contracts.Lenman, p45 They were billeted (housed) with civilians, usually by force. This was known as the Buannacht system. As the custom of mercenary hire spread from its origin in the north of the country, the scale and destructiveness of warfare in Ireland steadily increased. Mercenary hire was often founded on family links, with Shane O'Neill's alliance by marriage with the MacLeans and Campbells facilitating his importation of fighting men from those clans.Falls, p.81 As the Elizabethan conflict in Ireland proceeded to its culmination in the Nine Years' War, the use of seasonal Scottish mercenaries was further expanded, as the gallowglass system could not meet the demands posed by the extremely large armies that Elizabeth I employed in Ireland. Despite this, the English never considered engaging the redshanks on a large scale themselves, although Lord Deputy Russell advocated it, and gallowglasses had been employed in the early years of Elizabeth's reign.Falls, p.84 This initial period of the redshanks' employment ended with the final collapse of native Irish resistance in 1603. Use in the Confederate Wars In the mid 17th century, a large number of Scottish Highlanders, also often called \\"redshanks\\", fought in the Irish Confederate Wars, notably the clansmen serving under Alasdair Mac Colla, himself a member of a minor Hebridean branch of Clan Donald (a cadet family of Macdonald of Dunnyveg).Ohlmeyer, Civil War and Restoration in the Three Stuart Kingdoms, 2001, p.198 However, the Highlanders who fought at Dungan's Hill and Knocknanuss were to be the last of the redshanks.Stevenson, 1981, p.189 The subsequent Cromwellian conquest of Ireland saw the end of the employment of Highland mercenaries, both through the destruction of their employers, the Irish nobility, and the pacification of the Highlands.

In nineteen (19) different Flood Control Acts since 1917, the United States Congress has authorized the corps to design and build flood protection projects and one risk reduction system in the Greater New Orleans area and throughout the nation. Many of the Corps of Engineers' civil works projects in New Orleans have been characterized as being riddled with patronage (see pork barrel) or a waste of money.http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1646611_1646683_1648904,00.html Projects have allegedly been justified based on flawed or manipulated analyses during the planning phase. Some projects are said to have created profound detrimental environmental effects and/or provided questionable economic benefit such as the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet in southeast Louisiana. Faulty design and substandard construction have been cited in the failure of levees in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Reforming the Corps' way of doing business has been championed by Senators Russ Feingold and John McCain. The corps has been accused of conducting an orchestrated plan to disparage its critics by posting online anonymous comments. The leader of an independent levee investigation accused the upper levels of the corps of unethical behavior pertaining to its investigation of the levee failures in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. There are several cases of the corps being accused of muzzling expert investigators. One of the difficulties of making changes, however, is the political process itself.Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold On Reforming the Army Corps of Engineers Whether or not USACE planners and engineers actually do the best they can with what they are directed to do is part of the controversy. Federal Investigation of Levee Failures following Hurricane Katrina  = Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force (IPET) =  Claims of conflict of interest  In October 2005, the Chief of Engineers at the Army Corps, Lt. General Carl Strock commissioned the IPET (Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force) to evaluate the performance of the hurricane protection systems in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. It was to \\"provide credible and objective scientific and engineering answers to fundamental questions about the performance of the hurricane protection and flood damage reduction system in the New Orleans metropolitan area.\\" This meant that the organization responsible for the flood protection's performance would convene and manage an investigation of its own work. Neither Louisiana's governor nor the Louisiana Congressional delegation pointed out what appeared to be a conflict of interest. However, Steve Ellis (Taxpayers for Common Sense), Scott Faber (Environmental Defense) and Ivor van Heerden (Louisiana State University Hurricane Center) protested. They preferred to see some sort of independent, federally authorized commission look into the levee breaches, in addition to the Corps. After the IPET draft final report was released, the grassroots group, Levees.org, headquartered in New Orleans and led by Sandy Rosenthal questioned the credibility of this levee investigation as well. They noted that the study was convened and closely managed by the Corps of Engineers, the agency responsible for the levee design and construction, and that an independent commission should be created. The group contacted U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu's office and submitted documentation with statistics revealing that of the top three IPET leaders, two work for USACE and one did for 15 years (1986‚Äì2002). Of the 23 task team leaders, six work for the Corps and seven work for the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). In 10 out of the 15 volumes of the IPET draft final report, the majority of the team members were Corps of Engineers personnel. According to the IPET draft final report, IPET membership consisted of individuals from the Universities of Maryland, Florida, Notre Dame, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the South Florida Water Management District, Harris County Flood Control District (Houston, TX), the United States Department of Agriculture, and the United States Bureau of Reclamation as well as those from USACE. = American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) involvement = ASCE's press release contains wrong/conflicting information On 1 June 2007, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued its External Peer Review (ERP) report, the peer review of the Corps-sponsored IPET and also an accompanying press release. However, the press release was criticized because it contained information that was not present in the report, included information that conflicted with the report, and minimized the Army Corps' involvement in the catastrophe. The press release stated, \\"Even without breaching, Hurricane Katrina‚Äôs rainfall and surge overtopping would have caused extensive and severe flooding‚Äîand the worst loss of life and property loss ever experienced in New Orleans.\\" Meanwhile, the ERP report stated that had levees and pump stations not failed, \\"far less property loss would have occurred and nearly two-thirds of deaths could have been avoided.\\" This determination was on page 39 of an 80-page report. The New Orleans Times Picayune editorial board decried ASCE's press release. Raymond Seed submits ethics complaint In October 2007, Raymond Seed, a civil engineering professor at the University of California- Berkeley and an ASCE member submitted an ethics complaint to the ASCE which alleged that the Corps of Engineers, with the help of the ASCE, sought to minimize the Corps' mistakes in the flooding, intimidate anyone who tried to intervene, and delay the final results until the public's attention had turned elsewhere. The Corps acknowledged receiving a copy of the letter but has refused to comment until after the ASCE's Committee on Professional Conduct (CPC), led by Rich Hovey, comments on the complaint. It took over a year for the ASCE to announce the results of the CPC. When the results of the self- study were finally announced, the ASCE panel did not file any charges of ethical misconduct. They blamed their errors in their June press release on its creation by \\"staff level and not by review panel members.\\" Grassroots group posts satire of relationship between ASCE and USACE In November 2007, Levees.Org posted a spoof on YouTube satirizing what it believed was an overly cozy relationship between the Army Corps of Engineers and the members of the ASCE's ERP. The video depicted money changing hands in an overstuffed brief case and ERP members covered with bling. The group contended that the ERP validating the IPET process was an apparent conflict of interest because the Corps selected the ASCE, directly paid the ASCE over $2 million and awarded the panel members Outstanding Civilian Service Medals (OCSM) before their work was complete. The ASCE presented Levees.org with a threat of lawsuit if the group did not remove the video from YouTube. The group took it down while its leader Sandy Rosenthal examined options from response. Flanked by lawyers with Adams and Reese, the group ignored the threat and reposted the controversial video to YouTube citing Louisiana's Anti-SLAPP statute‚Äîa \\"strategic lawsuit against public participation\\"‚Äîwhich allows courts to weed out lawsuits designed to chill public participation on matters of public significance. In a response for comment, President David Mongan P.E. replied, \\"Since the video has already been widely reposted by other organizations, moving forward, we feel our time and expertise are best utilized working to help protect the residents of New Orleans from future storms and flooding.\\" Two panels are created to examine claims of ethics breaches In 8 December 2007, the ASCE confirmed that it had launched two ethics investigations. One of them was an internal probe led by Rich Hovey to look into Dr. Ray Seed's claims in his 42-page ethics complaint accusing it of colluding with the Army Corps to cover up its engineering mistakes discovered after the 2005 hurricane struck. The second was external and would look at the ethics of the ASCE receiving funds directly from those organizations selecting the ASCE for its peer reviews. The task force was chaired by the Honorable Sherwood L. Boehlert, former Chairman of the House Science Committee. The other participants are as follows: Joseph Bordogna, PhD, Former Deputy Director of the National Science Foundation; Jack W. Hoffbuhr, P.E., DEE, Former Executive Director of the American Water Works Association; Jack Snell, PhD, Former Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Building and Fire Research Laboratory; William A. Wulf, PhD, Former President of the National Academy of Engineering. On 12 September 2008, Congressman Boehlert released his investigative report on Dr. Ray Seed's allegations contained in his ethics complaint. The report, issued nearly nine months after their investigation began, criticized the ASCE for apparent conflicts of interest. The Boehlert Report made several major recommendations, the most important being that funding for peer reviews over $1 million should come from a separate source, like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The report also recommended that the ASCE Headquarters should facilitate but not control the assessment teams, and that dissemination of information to the public and press not be under the extremely tight controls that Dr. Seed and his team experienced. The report concluded that ASCE should draw up an ethics policy to eliminate questions of possible conflicts of interest. The task force also acknowledged that the On 6 April 2009, the internal probe with the ASCE issued a report that ordered a retraction of the ASCE's 1 June 2007 press release. The panel determined that the press release \\"inadvertently conveyed a misleading impression regarding the role of engineering failures in the devastation of New Orleans.\\" The release also incorrectly said that surge levels along Mississippi's coastline were higher than water levels caused by a tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004, and incorrectly repeated estimates of deaths and property damage that might have occurred in New Orleans if levees and floodwalls hadn't been breached. = Design problems and mechanisms of failure = On 5 April 2006, months after independent investigators had demonstrated that the levee failures were not due to natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lt. Gen. Carl Strock testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that, \\"We have now concluded we had problems with the design of the structure.\\" He also testified that the Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to 29 August 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study (E-99 study) by the corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design.[28] This issue is addressed again in a study released in August 2015 by J. David Rogers et al. who concluded that a misinterpretation of the 1986 study occurred apparently because the Corps had draped a tarpaulin over the gap that formed between the bases of the deflecting sheet piles and the soil in which they were embedded, so they did not see the gap. The tarpaulin was there for safety and to stop water that would seep through the interlocks. Failure to include the gap in interpretation of the test results introduced unconservatism in the final designs based on these tests. It allowed the use of shorter sheet piles, and reduced overall flood protection reliability. Ivor van Heerden = Team Louisiana investigation report = Scientists from LSU and from the private sector conducted a forensic investigation of the levee failures. Commissioned by the Louisiana State Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD), it was led by Dr. Ivor van Heerden, Deputy Director of the LSU Hurricane Center, and released in 2007. They found that the hurricane protection system was not properly conceived to accomplish the 1965 Congressional mandate to protect against the \\"most severe combination of meteorological conditions reasonably expected,\\" and they highlighted many other shortcomings in the hurricane protection system creation practices. It recommended independent review of levee projects, among other suggestions.http://www.publichealth.hurricane.lsu.edu/Adobe%20files%20for%20webpage/Team%20LA%20indiv/Team%20Louisiana%20-%20cov,%20toc,%20exec%20summ,%20intro.pdf =Lawsuit against Louisiana State University (LSU)= On 9 April 2009 LSU announced it was firing Ivor van Heerden, effective the end of the spring semester 2010. Van Heerden said he was not offered any reason. A criticism from a retired corps employee was that van Heerden, a geologist, had allegedly offered \\"engineering services\\" or had represented himself \\"as an engineer publicly without having a professional engineer's license\\" and consequently was a legal liability for his employer, LSU.Charles E. Settoon, \\"Geologist out of his league\\" in Times-Picayune, 2009 April 21, p. B4. Settoon is a professional engineer (P.E.) in Kenner, Louisiana. On 10 February 2010, Dr. Van Heerden filed a wrongful termination lawsuit in Louisiana state court alleging that LSU officials waged a campaign of retaliation against him that culminated with the termination of his position with the university. He settled with the university shortly after embarrassing emails were made public. The emails traded between members of the Louisiana Governor's office and LSU officials three weeks after Katrina revealed an apparent early plan to muzzle Dr. Ivor van Heerden when he blamed the Army Corps of Engineers for most of the New Orleans area flooding during Katrina. Dr. Van Heerden settled for $435,000. The university spent nearly a million dollars fighting the legal case.  Public relations controversies  In 2007, the New Orleans District hired a PR firm, Outreach Process Partners (OPP), allegedly to develop educational materials and set up public meetings that the Corps is required by law to hold in order to get feedback from residents about corps' projects. The total cost of the PR contract was $5,200,000. In May 2009, an internet blogger discovered that OPP had a bar graph on its website that boasted how it helped reduce negative news coverage that plagued the Corps following Hurricane Katrina. The group Levees.org publicly stated that corps' should not be spending taxpayer dollars trying to repair its reputation.  Internet Scandal  In December 2008, Sandy Rosenthal leader of the group Levees.org called a New Orleans CBS affiliate television station and offered to give them an exclusive to publicize several incidences in which employees of the corps used taxpayer-funded computers to post derogatory blog comments deriding citizen activists' efforts. In response to the news story, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers described the event as an isolated incident. Three days after the incident was publicized, the Commander of the New Orleans District of the Corps of Engineers, Colonel Alvin Lee, issued a formal apology. \\"Please accept my apology for the unprofessional comments someone in my District posted to your web site,\\" said the letter. \\"I have reinforced with my entire staff that this was an inappropriate and unacceptable use of our computers and time.\\" On 23 June 2009, US Senator Mary Landrieu issued this statement to WWL TV Eyewitness News in New OrleansBREAKING NEWS: US Senator will urge the Pentagon to review alleged Corps campaign against critics  Levees.Org with regard to the scandal: On 29 September 2009, the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office has closed its investigation. \\"We believe that (corps New Orleans District office) officials took appropriate actions once informed of the allegations at issue,\\" Assistant Inspector General John Crane said in a letter to U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. \\"Accordingly, further review by this agency is not warranted.\\" Those actions included strongly worded messages to corps employees telling them comments that demeaned corps critics were not allowed. In addition, access to the site of the Levees.org group was blocked from corps computers, preventing employees from commenting there. Lastly, the employee of a contractor‚Äîwho was a former corps employee himself and was identified as using a government computer to post disparaging remarks on NOLA.com‚Äîwas barred from working on corps projects.Department of Defense Inspector General closes investigation into allegations of derogatory postings to NOLA.com by Army Corps of Engineers employees  NOLA.com  Environmental challenges  = Debate over type of flood protection = Different types of hurricane protection were proposed to protect the southern Louisiana region. Between 1970 and 1975, the Corps developed a plan for massive sea gates for the region east of New Orleans that would prevent storm surge from flowing through Lake Borgne and into Lake Pontchartrain through the Rigolets and Chef Menteur passes. Referred to as the Barrier Plan, it included a series of levees along the lake Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW), a navigable inland waterway. A small group, led by Luke Fontana, filed a lawsuit against the Barrier Plan in 1976 over the Corps' Environmental Impact Study (EIS). In Save our Wetlands v Rush, the plaintiffs claimed that the Corps' EIS did not meet the requirements of Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The court agreed with Fontana noting, among other things, that the EIS was based on obsolete data and that the Corps' biological analysis 'relied entirely on a single telephone conversation with a marine biologist.' Judge Charles Schwartz issued an injunction preventing further progress on the barrier option until the Corps revised its EIS. However, the Corps did not return and, in 1980, concluded that an alternative option of higher levees providing hurricane protection was less costly, less damaging to the environment and more acceptable to local interests After Katrina, the controversy was revisited, with some blaming the lack of the massive barriers ‚Äì and the environmentalists ‚Äì for the storm's destruction. But Corps' officials told the Government Accountability Office that \\"if they had gone ahead with the floodgate plan, Katrina's devastation would have been even worse, because the barriers would not have been large enough to keep the storm surge out of the lake ‚Äì and the levees around the city would have been even lower.\\" Lawsuits issues in New Orleans A Texas Army National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk deposits a 6,000+ pound bag of sand and gravel to close the breach in the 17th Street Canal, New Orleans, 4 September 2005. In March 2007, the City of New Orleans filed a $77 billion claim against the USACE for damages sustained from faulty levee construction and resultant flooding during Hurricane Katrina. Of this amount, only $1 billion was designated as direct \\"infrastructure damages\\"; the rest was attributed to consequential damages such as industry losses and the city's tarnished image. Hundreds of thousands of individual claims were received in the Corps' New Orleans District office. In addition to the City of New Orleans, other claimants include Entergy New Orleans, the city's now-bankrupt electric utility, and New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board. In February 2007 U.S. District Court Judge Stan Duval ruled that the Flood Control Act of 1928 did not apply to cases involving navigational projects. He ruled that the Corps may be sued over alleged defects in its Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet navigation channel. Immunity for cases involving flood levees was apparently not addressed at that time. On 30 January 2008, Judge Duval ruled that even though the US Army Corps of Engineers was negligent and derelict in their duty to provide flood protection for the citizens of New Orleans, he was compelled to dismiss a class action lawsuit filed against the Corps for levee breaches after Hurricane Katrina. He cited the Flood Control Act of 1928 which, among other actions, provided protection to the federal government from lawsuits when flood control projects like levees break. Duval's decision left the New Orleans Sewerage & Water Board and Orleans Levee District as defendants in the lawsuit. The dismissal of the lawsuit also denied about 489,000 claims by businesses, government entities, and residents, seeking trillions of dollars in damages against the Corps, which were pinned to the suit and a similar one filed over flooding from a navigation channel in St. Bernard Parish. It was unclear how many claims could still move forward. The plaintiffs vowed to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On 19 November 2009, the Court found the Army Corps responsible for the flooding by not properly maintaining the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal (MRGO). Judge Duval said that the \\"Corps had an opportunity to take a myriad of actions to alleviate this deterioration or rehabilitate this deterioration and failed to do so.\\" Duval ruled in favor of five of the six plaintiffs, awarding those from Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish between $100,000 and $317,000 in damages. Duval, however, ruled against a couple from New Orleans East.Court: Army Corps of Engineers liable for Katrina flooding. CNN. 19 November 2009. In his decision, Duval wrote that the Corps was aware that deteriorating conditions of the canal would affect the levees in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhoods.

Los Angeles Times. 19 November 2009 A spokesman for the Corps indicated the matter would be appealed, up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court. In April 2019, a federal appeals court overturned the decision, saying that the plaintiffs failed to prove that construction or operation of the outlet caused the flooding.

With an estimated NASA cost of $2.5 billion (FY07), TSSM was proposed to launch in 2020, get gravity assists from Earth and Venus, and arrive at the Saturn system in 2029. The 4-year prime mission would include a two-year Saturn tour, a 2-month Titan aero-sampling phase, and a 20-month Titan orbit phase. In 2009, a mission to Jupiter and its moons was given priority over Titan Saturn System Mission, although TSSM will continue to be assessed for possible development and launch. Origin and status The Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) was officially created in January 2009 by the merging of the ESA's Titan and Enceladus Mission (TandEM) with NASA's Titan Explorer (2007) study, although plans to combine both concepts date at least back to early 2008. TSSM was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) proposal for funding, and in February 2009 it was announced that NASA/ESA had given EJSM priority ahead of TSSM.NASA and ESA Prioritize Outer Planet MissionsJupiter in space agencies' sights TSSM will continue to be studied for a later launch date, probably sometime in the 2020s. Detailed assessment reports of the mission elements as well as a specific concept for a lake-landing module for Titan's lakes called Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) with the potential of becoming a part of the TSSM have been proposed in February and October 2009, respectively. The TSSM may be revived and launched on the SLS super-heavy-lift rocket.https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/Creech_SLS_Deep_Space.pdf Mission overview Part of the mission proposal is a balloon planned to circumnavigate Titan. The TSSM mission consists of an orbiter and two Titan exploration probes: a hot air balloon (\\"Montgolfier\\" type) that will float in Titan's clouds, and a lander that will splash down on one of its methane seas. Both probes‚Äô data are to be relayed to a Titan orbiter. They will be equipped to study Titan's features with instruments for imaging, radar profiling, and surface as well as atmospheric sampling, much more complete than done by the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens mission. The spacecraft will use several gravity assist flybys of other planets to enable it to reach Saturn. The baseline design envisaged a September 2020 launch, followed by four gravity assists (Earth‚ÄìVenus‚ÄìEarth‚ÄìEarth), and arrival at Saturn 9 years later in October 2029. This is one of several available Earth-to-Saturn transfer options from the year 2018 through 2022. Current NASA plans do not give the TSSM a priority, however, and it is unlikely any of the proposed launch dates can be met. Upon Saturn arrival, in October 2029, the orbiter's chemical propulsion system would place the flight system into orbit around Saturn, followed by a two-year Saturn Tour Phase, characterized by the deployment of the in situ elements, and including a minimum of seven close Enceladus flybys and 16 Titan flybys. During this period, repeated satellite gravity assists and manoeuvres will reduce the energy needed to insert into Titan's orbit. As the craft completes its flyby by Enceladus, the orbiter will analyze the unusual cryovolcanic plumes at the moon's south pole. The montgolfi√®re, a hot air balloon, would be released on approach to the first Titan flyby for ballistic entry into Titan's atmosphere for its six Earth months‚Äô mission from April 2030 to October 2030. Based on Cassini‚ÄìHuygens discoveries, the montgolfi√®re should be able to circumnavigate Titan at least once during its nominal lifetime at its deployment latitude of about 20¬∞N, 10 kilometers above Titan's surface. =Lake lander= The Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) could become the lake-lander of the TSSM. Numerous proposals have been brought forward with respect to the lake-lander concept. One of the most detailed plans so far is the so-called Titan Mare Explorer (TiME), which had originally been proposed as a separate scout mission, but might eventually be postponed and included in the TSSM.Nuclear-Powered Robot Ship Could Sail Seas of Titan (14 October 2009) If approved, TiME would be released by the orbiter on its second Titan flyby. Due to Titan's haze layer and its distance to the Sun, the lander cannot be powered by solar panels and it would rely on the new Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG),NASA's Planetary Science Division Update (June 23, 2008). which is a prototype meant to provide availability of long-lived power supplies for landed networks and other planetary missions. The lander will target Ligeia Mare, a northern polar sea of liquid hydrocarbons at about 79¬∞N. The probe will descend by parachute, like the Huygens probe of 2005. During the 6 hours of descent it will analyze the atmosphere and then splashdown on the liquid surface. The plutonium-powered craft's principal function is to sample and analyze organics on the surface for a period of about 3 to 6 months; this would be the first floating exploration of an extraterrestrial sea. Science goals and objectives The major goals of the TSSM mission can be summarized under four categories: *Explore Titan as a system *Study Titan's organic inventory and astrobiological potential *Constrain Titan's origin and evolution models *Recover information on Enceladus and Saturn's magnetosphere Comparison of Ligeia Mare's area with Lake Superior on Earth. At Titan, the science goals would be to provide information on such aspects as the composition of the surface and the geographic distribution of the various organic constituents; on the methane cycle and the methane reservoirs; on the ages of the surface features, and in particular on whether cryovolcanism and tectonism are actively ongoing or are relics of a more active past; on the presence or absence of ammonia, of a magnetic field and of a sub-surface ocean; on the chemistry that drives complex ion formation in the upper atmosphere; and on a large altitude range in the atmosphere, from 400‚Äì900 km, which remains poorly explored after Cassini. In addition, much remains to be understood about seasonal changes of the atmosphere at all levels, and the long-term escape of constituents to space. TiME lander would splashdown on Ligeia Mare, a methane sea on Titan's northern hemisphere. It is believed that Titan's methane cycle is analogous to Earth's hydrologic cycle, with meteorological working fluid existing in liquid and gas phase. TiME would directly discern the methane cycle of Titan and help understand its similarities and differences to the hydrologic cycle on Earth. However, questions about the sources of re-supply of methane to the atmosphere remain to be answered. This world is built by organic activities which still operate and Cassini‚ÄìHuygens findings suggest a world with a balance of geologic and atmospheric processes that is the solar system's best analogue to Earth. Moreover, an interior ocean discovered by Cassini, deep underneath Titan's dense atmosphere and surface is thought to be largely composed of liquid water. TSSM would be the first mission in the 50 years of space exploration where an extensive and interdisciplinary in situ survey of active organic chemistry and climate on the land, on the sea, and in the air of another world will take place.

Born in Trife»ôti, Orhei County, in the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire, from 1918 to 1940 a part of Greater Romania and today in Moldova, his parents were the peasants Vartolomeu and Alexandrina (n√©e GalburƒÉ). He graduated from the normal school in Orhei in 1936 and from the reserve officers' school the following year. Between 1937 and 1939, he was a teacher in Tvardi»õa, Tighina County, and in UmbrƒÉre»ôti, Tecuci County. He performed his military service in 1939‚Äì1940, fought on the Eastern Front of World War II from 1940 to 1944 and was one of the Romanian prisoners of war in the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1948. Between 1951 and 1969, he edited the children's programs at Radioteleviziunea Rom√¢n«é.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol. I, p. 699. Pite»ôti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. He was one of the creators of the show and wrote over 50 radio scripts for it. In 1958, the program changed from a radio format to a television format and had been continuously running for 50 years in 2007. Among the magazines for which he wrote were Roza and Basarabia literarƒÉ from Chi»ôinƒÉu, CutezƒÉtorii, Lumini»õa and Arici Pogonici. His poetic and prose debut came in 1938, in Orhei's Speran»õa. His first published work was a small 1942 volume of poetry, Litanii de searƒÉ, followed a decade later by the selection of stories Nucul lui Toderi»õƒÉ. Further publications included stories and legends, several novels and books of stories for adults. In 1980, he published the poems he wrote between 1940 and 1970, republishing part of them in 1988. He also wrote for history-themed films. Part of his output was translated into a number of languages. The literary magazine Observator Cultural listed Gruia as one of the leading writers of children's literature in Romania, among others such as Dumitru Alma»ô, Gica Iutes, Octav Pancu-Ia»ôi, Mircea S√¢ntimbreanu, and Ovidiu Zotta.

National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111 (1938), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that the Kellogg Company was not violating any trademark or unfair competition laws when it manufactured its own Shredded Wheat breakfast cereal, which had originally been invented by the National Biscuit Company (later called Nabisco). Kellogg's version of the product was of an essentially identical shape, and was also marketed as \\"Shredded Wheat\\"; but Nabisco's patents had expired, and its trademark application for the term \\"Shredded Wheat\\" had been turned down as a descriptive, non-trademarkable term. The Court therefore \\"forcefully applied the principle that once a patent has expired, its benefits are to be freely enjoyed by the public.\\"David W. Carstens, Preemption of Direct Molding Statutes: Bonito Boats v. Thunder Craft Boats, 3 170 (1990).

It had a direct impact on the structure of the Lanham Act and is a \\"routine starting point for analysis in trademark opinions in lower courts.\\"  Background  Inventor Henry Perky developed a shredded wheat machine and introduced the cereal in 1893; he was issued utility patents in 1895 on both the shredded wheat and on the machine. John Kellogg tasted a sample and commented that they were like \\"eating a whisk broom.\\"Graeme B. Dinwoodie, \\"The Story of Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.: Breakfast with Brandeis\\", p. 3, Retrieved on 15 December 2008. Nevertheless, the cereal became successful, and Perky's company, the Shredded Wheat Company, continued to manufacture the product after he retired. The Kellogg Company started manufacturing shredded wheat cereal in 1912 after Perky's patents expired; after the Shredded Wheat Company objected, Kellogg stopped manufacturing their version in 1919. The nature of the settlement is not clear.Graeme B. Dinwoodie, \\"The Story of Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.: Breakfast with Brandeis\\", p. 5, Retrieved on 15 December 2008. In 1927, the Kellogg Company resumed manufacturing shredded wheat, prompting a lawsuit from the Shredded Wheat Company; the lawsuit was settled. In 1930, the Shredded Wheat Company was acquired by the National Biscuit Company (later Nabisco), which again sued Kellogg, both in Canada and in the United States, for unfair competition. Nabisco complained in its lawsuit about Kellogg's use of the term \\"Shredded Wheat\\"; the similarity of its cereal biscuits' shape to the Nabisco cereal biscuits; and Kellogg's use on the product box of a picture of two of the pillow-shaped cereal biscuits submerged in milk. The complaint about the picture was based on trademark law; the other two complaints were that Kellogg's was fraudulently trying to \\"pass off\\" its cereal as Nabisco's. Nabisco had previously failed in its attempt to register \\"Shredded Wheat\\" as a trademark, as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had rejected the registration, as descriptive.  Opinion of the Court  In a 7‚Äì2 opinion written by Justice Brandeis, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Nabisco's arguments, and allowed Kellogg to continue to manufacture its shredded wheat cereal, and name it \\"Shredded Wheat\\". On the protection of the cereal's shape, the Court decided that the shape was functional and that there was a right to copy it after its patent expired, as the use of unfair competition and trademark laws could otherwise be used to impede the ability of rivals to create any competitive product, even though the patent had expired. On the picture of the two shredded wheat biscuits in the bowl of milk, the Court noted that \\"the name Kellogg was so prominent on all of the defendant's cartons as to minimize the possibility of confusion\\", and hence there was no fraudulent \\"passing off\\" of Kellogg's cereal biscuits as having been created by Nabisco. On the use of the term \\"Shredded Wheat\\", the Court ruled that the term was generic and not trademarkable; and dismissed a claim by Nabisco that it had acquired a \\"secondary meaning\\" under case law. The Court concluded: Justice McReynolds and Justice Butler dissented, writing that Kellogg was \\"fraudulently seeking to appropriate to itself the benefits of a goodwill built up at great cost by the respondent\\", which should be viewed as illegal.U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Supreme Court 301 U.S. 111, Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.  Subsequent developments  Kellogg has become a foundation of the functionality doctrine, that product designs that are intrinsic to functionality cannot be protected under unfair competition or trademark laws, because this would impede the ability of competitors to make a rival product.Graeme B. Dinwoodie, \\"The Story of Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.: Breakfast with Brandeis\\", p. 22, Retrieved on 15 December 2008. Trademark law was in a state of flux in 1938, when Kellogg was decided, and the U.S. Department of Justice sought to explicitly codify the Kellogg decision into law, as part of the Lanham Act. One commentator maintained that one could properly‚Äî > ...view Kellogg as vindication of the views that he [Brandeis] expressed in > INS [v. AP].

She ran unsuccessfully for the Florida Senate in 2010 and again for the Florida House in 2016. History Skidmore was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and moved to the state of Florida in 1972, where she attended Deerfield Beach High School. She worked as a legislative aide to then-State Senator Ron Klein from 1996 to 2005, and then served as the Vice-President of Advocacy and Public Policy for the Florida Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation. Florida House of Representatives In 2006, State Representative Irving Slosberg opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re- election. Skidmore ran to succeed Slosberg in the 90th District, which included Deerfield Beach and Delray Beach in western Broward County and Palm Beach County. She faced Len Turesky, Sheldon Klasfield, and Harvey Arnold in the Democratic primary, and was endorsed by the AFL-CIO and by former United States Attorney General Janet Reno. During the campaign, Skidmore campaigned on her legislative experience working as Klein's aide, though she was attacked by Turesky for exaggerating her role in Klein's office. Ultimately, Skidmore emerged narrowly victorious in the crowded field, winning 29% of the vote to Turesky's 28%, Klasfield's 22%, and Arnold's 21%. She was unopposed in the general election. In 2008, Slosberg opened a campaign account to reclaim his old seat and challenge Skidmore in the Democratic primary, but ultimately declined to do so. Consequently, Skidmore was elected to her second term uncontested. During her tenure in the legislature, Skidmore worked to combat abuses in the state's pain clinics, successfully sponsoring legislation with fellow State Representative Kurt Kelly to create a statewide database for pain medicine prescriptions. In 2010, she proposed banning convicted felons from owning and operating pain clinics and placing limits on the quantity of prescription painkillers that physicians would be allowed to prescribe. 2010 Florida Senate campaign Incumbent State Senator Jeff Atwater was unable to seek re-election in 2010 due to term limits, so Skidmore ran to succeed him in the 25th District, which stretched from West Palm Beach to Fort Lauderdale in Broward County and Palm Beach County. She won the Democratic primary unopposed, and advanced to the general election, where she faced Republican State Representative Ellyn Setnor Bogdanoff and independent candidate Miranda Rosenberg. Skidmore campaigned on her support for liberal social policies, including her opposition to additional restrictions on abortion and her support for ending the state's gay adoption ban. The Florida Democratic Party invested heavily on behalf of Skidmore's campaign, aiming to win the seat to prevent Senate Republicans from winning a two-thirds majority in the chamber. The Sun-Sentinel, though praising both Bogdanoff and Skidmore as \\"seasoned, accomplished veterans of the Florida Legislature,\\" endorsed Bogdanoff, suggesting that her leadership role among Republican legislators would benefit the district. Ultimately, despite the fact that Barack Obama narrowly won the district in 2008, Skidmore was defeated by a wide margin, winning 38% of the vote to Bogdanoff's 58% and Rosenberg's 5%. After the State House After losing the 2010 election and retiring from the Florida House, Skidmore was named the executive director of Broward Days, an organization of government and business leaders who lobby the Florida Legislature for Broward County- friendly legislation. Following State Representative Irving Slosberg's decision to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, Skidmore ran to replace him in the 90th District. She faced Slosberg's daughter, attorney Emily Slosberg, in the Democratic primary. Skidmore campaigned on her legislative experience, which included working on a bipartisan effort to regulate pain clinics in South Florida. She emphasized the practical reality that Democrats were at a \\"severe minority\\" in the Florida House, but nonetheless argued that she would help fight against Republican efforts to restrict access to abortion. Skidmore also campaigned on making Florida \\"a global marine research hub,\\" expanding healthcare for impoverished Floridians, and \\"develop[ing] educational programs that would better match the needs of Florida's businesses.\\" Ultimately, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed her campaign, calling the choice between Skidmore and Slosberg \\"easy\\" and noting that \\"Skidmore has a much stronger grasp of the issues facing Florida and an admirable understanding of how politics works in Tallahassee.\\" However, Slosberg ended up narrowly beating Skidmore, 52-48%, a difference of just 600 votes.

Film historians and Earhart scholars consider Flight for Freedom an \\"a-clef\\" version of the Amelia Earhart life story, concentrating on the sensational aspects of her disappearance during her 1937 world flight.Goldstein and Dillon 1997, pp. 273‚Äì274. The film's ending speculated that the main character's disappearance was connected to a secret mission on behalf of the U.S. government. As a propaganda film, the Japanese characters in Flight for Freedom were portrayed as devious and evil.Butler 1997, p. 416. Plot In the aviation establishment of the 1930s, well-known aviatrix Tonie Carter is fighting the prejudice against women pilots. One of her rivals, pilot Randy Britton, is attracted to her. After setting flight records flying for her former mentor, Paul Turner, Tonie embarks on a solo circumnavigation of the globe. When her plans are made public, U.S. Navy Admiral Graves seeks to convince her to undertake a top-secret mission involving flying over Japanese-held territory in the Mandated Islands. Flying for the navy, Randy has discovered the Japanese-mandated islands have hidden military installations. When Tonie receives a classified message in Hawaii, she aborts her takeoff in order to meet Graves who asks her to turn her record-breaking flight into a spy mission. Awaiting repair of her aircraft, Tonie travels back to mainland United States accompanied by Paul Turner, who reveals he wants to marry her at the conclusion of the flight. Turner, however, is apprehensive about the dangers involved in her flight. One of the concerns is that Gull Island, a tiny island rendezvous in the Pacific is a daunting challenge for even the best navigator. The U.S. Navy sends Randy Britton to join Tonie in New Guinea as her navigator. She finds out that the Japanese will be waiting for her on Gull Island. Not wanting to jeopardize Randy, her true love, Carter takes off early in the morning before he reaches the airport. She vanishes during the latter part of the world flight, triggering a massive search which proves fruitless. Cast Production A combination of live action and miniatures in Flight for Freedom was used to depict the final flight of Tonie Carter. Flight for Freedom was produced by RKO, whose CEO, Floyd Odlum, was married to Jacqueline Cochran, one of Earhart's close friends and a renowned aviator in her own right. It was claimed to be based on a screenplay submitted by Amelia Earhart's husband, George P. Putnam.Lovell 1989, p. 421. Rosalind Russell's characterization of the Earhart-like aviator shows Carter establishing a reputation as \\"the Lady Lindbergh\\" and setting numerous aviation records. Other characters are loosely drawn from real life, such as Earhart confidant and instructor Paul Mantz, as well as Fred Noonan, albeit in the role of pilot Randy Britton, played by Fred MacMurray, on loan from Paramount Pictures. Principal photography, under the working title Stand to Die, was completed from late-August to late-October 1942, with additional scenes shot in December, as the release was held back to coincide with the headline news surrounding the Battle of Midway. Newsreel footage was incorporated to show naval missions over the area that Tonie Carter was portrayed as having overflown.\\"Notes: 'Flight for Freedom'.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

She was descended from Edward I of England through her mother, while her father is famous for being the favorite of Edward II of England. Marriage Though he had stood against Edward II in the past, Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel had loyally supported him since the 1320s. Thus it must have seemed to be politically prudent to Edmund to marry his heir Richard to the eldest daughter of the King's closest friend and adviser Hugh le Despenser. For Hugh's part, a large incentive for him must have been that he could expect his daughter Isabel would one day become Countess of Arundel.Higginbotham, Susan. \\"Divorce, Medieval Style\\" Retrieved 15 October 2009. . On 9 February 1321 at the royal manor Havering-atte-Bower, Isabel was duly married to Richard FitzAlan, the heir to the earldom of Arundel.Given-Wilson (1991), p. 2. Isabel was only eight at the time, while Richard was fifteen (not seven as has been claimed). Their respective ages would come up later when Richard would try to seek an annulment. Annulment Richard and Isabel had one son, Edmund Fitzalan, born in 1327, and in 1331 Isabel's husband became earl of Arundel. However, in December 1344 Richard Fitzalan had their marriage annulled on the grounds that he had never freely consented to marry Isabel and that they both had renounced their vows at puberty but had been \\"forced by blows to cohabit, so that a son was born\\". Isabel retired to several manors in Essex that were given to her by her ex- husband. After receiving a papal dispensation, Richard married Isabel's first cousin Eleanor of Lancaster, with whom he had apparently been having an affair. Richard and Isabel's only child, Edmund Fitzalan, was rendered illegitimate by this annulment and so was unable to inherit his father's earldom. When his father died in 1376 Edmund quarreled with his half-siblings, the children of his father's second marriage, over inheritance rights. Edmund was imprisoned in the Tower of London until he was released in 1377 by request of his brothers-in-law. Father's execution After their father was executed for treason in 1326, Isabel and her youngest sister Elizabeth were the only daughters of Hugh the Younger to escape being confined in nunneries, Isabel because she was already married and Elizabeth because of her youth.

The giant ball is usually two metres in diameter and has a zippered entrance to allow for easy entry and exit. The water ball is similar to the zorb but it has only one layer and is designed for water travel rather than down-hill rolling. In the United Kingdom, the balls have been used at swimming pools, marinas and lakes in an effort to keep children fit.Kids learn to walk on water. CBBC.  History  Water cylinder One of the first water balls appeared in the film Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and in the Beach Boys music video, Getcha Back (1985).Beach Boys ‚Äì Getcha Back. Retrieved: 2011-03-31. Charles Blane Jones designed the first water ball for public distribution in 1998.  Safety  Water balls have been used safely in over 50 countries around the world since 1998; however, there are some serious safety concerns with using the water balls on sea or near the beach. However, 99% of the amusement business uses the water balls in safe confined inflatable swimming pools with water levels that normally do not exceed 2 ft. and are under complete supervision at all times by trained and competent staff. Charles Jones from Oklahoma developed a water ball commercially in 1998. He was invited by a British reporter to visit London to demonstrate the ball on a lake. As soon as he attempted to walk across the water, he lost his balance and fell. The ball deflated and filled rapidly with icy water. He was saved from sinking below the surface when an assistant dragged the ball back to dry land using a safety line, witnessed by a crowd of tourists. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has warned of the dangers of the balls being used in a safe manner. The Commission is aware of two unconfirmed incidents involving water balls. In one, a child was found unresponsive after being inside the ball for a very brief period of time. After being examined, the child was found to be suffering from an unrelated ongoing medical problem. In the second incident, a person inside the ball suffered a fracture when it fell out of a shallow, above-ground pool onto hard ground.  Construction  Many water balls are constructed from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 0.8‚Äì1.0 mm thick. Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) are the best choice for use in cold weather or on snow. Some water balls are made from a PVC‚ÄìTPU mix. More expensive balls use 100% TPU. Balls are typically made in China, and come in various sizes. A typical water ball stores flat and weighs 15 kilograms, and can be inflated in under a minute with a good air pump. Some models also have hand grips on the inside or outside, and the surface can be printed on.

The \\"Burt Retractable\\" binding was a very complex invention, and an important part of the development of modern carving ski technology. It was the first and only binding which did not flatten the middle of the ski, which in turn would enable easier turning. The carving ski-technology was co-created by Georges Joubert in France. In 1975, Joachim Schelb (a student of Georges Joubert) used this binding with a Kneissl ski named \\"Jeans\\" which was the first carving ski model. On this ski, fitted with the Burt binding in 1975, Joachim. Schelb carved for the first time at Sommand-Praz-de-Lys in France. He was very successful in using this binding.

In the 2018‚Äì19 season they are playing in the Championnat National, the third tier in the French football league system. History Football Club Villefranche-Beaujolais was formed in 1927, from the football section of multi-sports club Cercle Sportif de Villefranche. The Beaujolais suffix of the name had been applied by 1985, the club being previously known as Football Club Villefranche. The club debuted in the national league structure in 1953 when champions of the Lyonnais region of Division d'Honneur they promoted to Division Nationale, the highest tier of amateur football. They maintained this level for five seasons, then relegated in 1958. Promotion to the Division Nationale in 1966 would follow when they were Lyonnaise regional champions. They relegated in 1969. In 1970 the club gained access to the Division Nationale for a third time. By successfully remaining in the division, the club became part of the third tier of French football when the FFF reorganised the leagues at the end of the 1970‚Äì71 season, taking part in the first edition of Division 3 in 1971. They remained that level until relegated to the regional league in 1976. FC Villefranche were founding members in 1978 when the FFF introduced a fourth division to the national league, having finished 6th in the regional Division d'Honneur the previous season. They maintained this level for the season with an 11th place finish. A third place season finish in 1979‚Äì80, promoted them to Division 3. In 1983 they were promoted to Division 2 although finishing in third place when the two higher placed teams became ineligible for promotion. The club stayed just one season in Division 2, finishing bottom of Group A and being relegated back to Division 3. They remained at that level until finishing bottom of their group in 1988, and in 1989 suffered a second successive relegation back to the regional league. In 1993 the FFF introduced a fifth tier, and the club secured a place in the new National 3 division as champions of the Division Honneur (now the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region, after internal restructuring of the French regional leagues). After a fourth place finish in their group in 1994 they secured promotion in 1995 by finishing second in their group. The club completed three seasons of mid-table finishes before being relegated in 2000 and 2001. As champions of the Division d'Honneur in 2004, they promoted to CFA2. In 2008, they won their group and were promoted to the fourth tier, CFA.

Together with the Prussian T 2 they were the first locomotives that were built to railway norms. The first units were delivered by Henschel in 1882.  Design  The T 3s had a wet steam engine with two cylinders that drove the centre coupled axle. The slide valves were worked by an outside Allan valve gear. The water supply was stored in a well tank between the frame under the boiler; the coal bunkers were on the left and right hand side of the firebox. In front of each one was a filler pipe for the water tank. The springs on both front axles were linked with equalising beams located above the running plate. The early T 3s did not have a steam dome, but were equipped with a regulator housing on top, from which the admission pipes led directly to the cylinders outside the boiler. The axle load of this locomotive was about 10 t (see first photo). Later batches (from 1887) had a steam dome, and the admission pipes were located in the smokebox. Due to the addition of the steam dome, the location of the sand box and sanders were changed. In addition the quantities of water and coal that could be carried were increased. The back wall of the cab was now straight and the lower section no longer sloped. The length over buffers increased from 8,300 mm to 8,591 mm, the axle load rose to 11 t (see second photo). From 1903 the supplies were increased again and the T 3 could now carry 5 m3 of water and 1.9 t of coal. The axle load of this \\"strengthened standard class\\" or \\"Standard class (6t)\\" (Normalbauart (6t)) was 12 t.  T 3s for other railways  A total of more than 1,300 T 3s were built for the Prussian state railways. But many other railways in Germany and abroad, from industrial railways to national railways, also bought locomotives based on the T 3 pattern, including the: * Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway (see Mecklenburg T 3) * Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways (see Oldenburg T 3) * Brunswick State Railway (BLE) * Oldenburg County Railway (Kreis Oldenburger Eisenbahn or KOE) * Zschipkau-Finsterwald Railway (ZFE) * Societ√† Veneta, Italy  DRG numbering  The second variant of the T 3 with steam dome 1975 stamp In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) took over 511 Prussian T 3s as their Class 89.70‚Äì75. The 473 locomotives of the older version were given numbers 89 7001‚Äì7456, 7473‚Äì7476 and 7499‚Äì7511. The 38 locomotives of the stronger design were given numbers 89 7457‚Äì7472 and 89 7477‚Äì7498. In incorporating locomotives later on from private railways that they had taken over, the DRG were not very logical. As a result, Class 89.75 ended up with a mixture of various locomotives types, in some cases with numbers that followed directly on from one another. * The locomotives whose numbers immediately followed the Prussian T3s, those with numbers 89 7512‚Äì7521, were not T 3s, but an industrial locomotive (Class Pudel which translates as \\"poodle\\") built by Jung for the former Bremen Harbour Railway that had been taken over by the DRG in 1930. These engines had a 15 t coupled axle load and were significantly heavier than the T 3. They had a Walschaerts valve gear and a small coal tank behind the cab. * The T 3s of the BLE, taken over in 1938 by the DRG, were given numbers 89 7531‚Äì7540. Locomotive 89 7535 was transferred that same year to the Gardelegen-Neuhaldensleben-Weferlingen railway. * Locomotive 89 7541, which also came from the BLE, only resembled the T 3 in terms of its frame and running gear. The dimensions of cylinders, grate and heating areas were different. * The three T 3s from the KOE, which was taken over by the DRG in 1941, were given numbers 89 7556, 89 7557 and 89 7559. No. 89 7558 was no T 3, but a somewhat more powerful class, the Bismarck class industrial locomotive built by Henschel. * The T 3 from the ZFE, taken over in 1943, was retired at the same time. The locomotives with numbers 89 7560‚Äì89 7564 were from a different class, that had a 12 t coupled axle load, but were no more powerful than the T 3.  After the Second World War  A T 3 crosses the Landwehr Canal in Berlin with a passenger train (ca. 1900). By the start of 1931 the DRG fleet of T 3s had been reduced to 254 units however, after the Second World War numerous T 3s entered the Deutsche Bundesbahn and Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany, where the last examples were retired in the mid-1960s. = Deutsche Reichsbahn = After 1945 the Deutsche Reichsbahn in the GDR inherited large numbers of T 3s from industrial and private railways as numbers 89 953, 5901‚Äì5903, 6001‚Äì6016, 6018, 6101‚Äì6132, 6134‚Äì6159, 6161, 6163, 6164, 6204‚Äì6211, 6215, 6216, 6218, 6220, 6221, 6228‚Äì6232, 6235, 6306, 7566‚Äì7568, 7571‚Äì7573 und 7578. These included several 'genuine' Prussian T 3s. The former 89 7535 of the Gardelegen-Neuhaldensleben-Weferlingen railway was incorporated in 1949 into the DR fleet and was given number 89 6220. This locomotive was not retired until 1967, the last T 3 in service with the DRG. The last T 3 engine on active duty, however, was the industrial engine at the Warburg Sugar Factory which retired in 1979 . Four more examples, which came from the Oderbruchbahn, were converted by the DR in 1960 and equipped with tenders. These engines were numbered 89 6222‚Äì6225 One example, 89 6222, was initially given a four-wheeled tender, the others a Class 3 T 12 tender. One of these later replaced the four-wheeled tender as well. The locos finished their service with the Kreisbahn Beeskow‚ÄìF√ºrstenwalde which took them on in 1950 and withdrew them in 1968. = Deutsche Bundesbahn = Around 70 T 3s ended up in the DB, the last one, 89 7538, being retired in 1963. However T 3s appeared briefly in the DB fleet later on. These were the industrial locomotives, nos. 2 and 3 from the Ausbesserungswerk at Schwerte, which were officially added to the DB fleet in 1968 as 089 002 and 089 003. The former locomotive 89 7531 hid behind number 089 003. It was finally retired on 21 June 1968 as the last T 3 in DB service. = Today = DR 89 6009 of the Dresden Transport Museum at Potsdam (1993) Several T 3s have been preserved today by museums, some being still operational. To these belong one of the locomotives with a tender, number 89 6009 (89 7403 before its conversion), which is a DB AG museum locomotive stabled at the Dresden Transport Museum.

He was first president of the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind and was also regarded as Grand Mufti of India He guided Indian Muslims through various spiritual and political turmoils for nearly fifty years. He was an educationist. The final years of his life were devoted to educational and social work. He was a founding member of Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, and was on its foundation committee, which was headed by Mahmud Hasan Deobandi. He was president of Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind from 1919 to 1940. Lineage Dehlawi‚Äòa ancestors came from Yemen, but his great-grandfathers were traders from Bahrain who travelled to India to sell their goods. At an unknown time, Dehlawi‚Äôs family shifted from Bhopal to Shahjahanpur. Dehlawi‚Äòs father, Inayatullah, had four sons and two daughters, but was rather poor. Early life Kifayatullah ibn Inayatullah ibn Faidhullah ibn Khairullah ibn 'Ibadullah Dehlvi was born in Shahjahanpur, a district in Uttar Pradesh, India in 1875. At the age of five, he commenced his education at the maktab of Hafiz Barakatullah. There, he completed the Qur'an and obtained instruction in Urdu and elementary Persian from Nasimullah. Thereafter, he enrolled at Madrasa 'Azeeziya. There, he completed his Persian studies, studying the most advanced kitab of Persian, Sikandar Naama, and commenced his Arabic studies under Budhun Khan. Then, Dehlawi was sent with a letter of recommendation from his teacher, 'Ubaidul Haq, to the administrator of the Madrasa 'Arabiya at Shahi Masjid in Muradabad. He was admitted and remained at the residence of Muhammad Isma'il. Since his father was poor, Dehlawi covered his educational expenses by weaving and selling topis. He studied there for two years. Dehlawi then enrolled at Darul Uloom Deoband in 1895. Because of his memory and intelligence, he did not exert as much effort, but quickly overtook his classmates and earned the highest marks on his examinations. He completed his studies at Darul Uloom Deoband in 1898 at the age of twenty-two. Career as a Teacher After graduating, Dehlawi spent time in Delhi with his close friend, Aminuddin. Then, he returned to Shahjahanpur, where his former teacher, 'Ubaidul Haq, had founded Madrasa 'Ainul 'Ilm. Dehlawi became a teacher there and handled the secretarial and administrative duties. Dehlawi also taught Arabic and Persian. His salary was fifteen rupees per month. Along with his duties as a teacher and administrator, Dehlawi started to answer fataawa during this period. In his answer to each fatwa, Dehlawi was meticulous and cautious and would answer with well-written evidence. While at Madrasa 'Ainul 'Ilm, Dehlawi also started a monthly periodical, Al Burhan, in response to the Ahmadis, . The first issue was published in Sha'baan of 1321 AH and made an attempt to refute Ahmadi beliefs. Around this time, the financial condition of Madrasa 'Ainul 'Ilm started to deteriorate. Thus, in 1321 AH, the teachers' salaries were reduced. Mufti's salary was reduced from eighteen to sixteen rupees per month. However, he remained at Madrasa 'Ainul 'Ilm for five more years until the death of his teacher, 'Ubaidul Haq Khan. Thereafter, Mufti moved to Delhi and became a teacher at Madrasa Aminia. Besides teaching hadith and answering fataawa, Mufti managed the organizational affairs of the madrasa. His salary was twenty rupees per month. In Delhi, Dehlawi quickly became renowned. Dignitaries and people of the upper-class would consult him in their political and religious affairs and would benefit from his advice. The courts of law benefited from his presence as well. After his arrival at Madrasa Aminia, Mufti commenced a step-by-step implementation of beneficial reforms to the educational structure of the madrasa. Then, in 1328 AH, he initiated an assembly called Anjuman Islahul Kalaam. The purpose of this gathering was to teach students how to deliver speeches and debate. Every eighth day, each student had to deliver a speech or engage in a dialogue and Mufti would help. This assembly was successful in its aim, but was eventually ended due to a lack of participation. After fifty years, Mufti had answered hundreds of thousands of fataawa and his rulings are a treasure to fiqh. The fataawa of Mufti were extremely concise yet full of well-written evidence. His fataawa were always answered according to the intent of the questioner. It was for this reason that he was renowned among common folk as well as the officials of the courts of law, who would prefer his rulings in religious cases. Activism Dehlawi drafted a fatwa recommending a boycott of British goods which was signed by around 500 Muslims scholars. Literary career From an early age, Dehlawi enjoyed reading and writing. His first major endeavour was the magazine, Al Burhan, which he wrote in refutation of the Ahmadi beliefs. His second major work was an Arabic poem, Raudur Rayyaahin, which was published in 1909. It was first presented at the annual convention of Madrasa Aminia in 1908. The eloquence and grandeur of the poem was such that Dehlawi was requested to and produced an Urdu translation with footnotes, providing more details than and explaining difficult words from the original. Dehlawi‚Äôs most renowned publication is Ta'limul Islam, four volumes of questions and answers for children in simple language. This contained details of the fundamental beliefs and practices of Islam. Dehlawi wrote various other religious treatises which were published as books, but are no longer available. Though Dehlawi was a prominent scholar and able writer, his literary works are few. The reason is that his teaching, political activities, domestic activities, and answering fataawa busied him to such an extent that he had no time to write. Final years and death During the final years of his life, due to the deterioration of morality in society, clashes between Hindus and Muslims, and various other reasons, Dehlawi withdrew from politics and became reclusive, not even giving public comment. In his final months he suffered severe liver illness, despite medical treatment. On 31 December 1952, he died at the age of seventy-seven. He was buried near Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, in Mehrauli, Delhi. His funeral was attended by 100,000 people. Students Dehlawi‚Äòs students include Muhammad Taqi Amini, Izaz Ali Amrohi and Deshbandhu Gupta.

It was built as a memorial to the first headmaster of The Leys, William Fiddian Moulton. Plans for the chapel, designed by architect Robert Curwen, were first presented to the school's second headmaster, W. T. A. Barber; he deemed the project an unnecessary luxury. School services continued to be held instead in the school hall, until 1904 when the school governors approved the chapel's construction. The cost, including all furnishings, was estimated in 1925 to have been ¬£39,000. The foundation stone was laid at the marble West Door by Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont on 8 June 1905 and the chapel was consecrated on 27 October 1906. The building's design is Gothic, to complement the surrounding buildings. All visible woodwork is in oak. The roof comprises elaborately worked trestles and tracery, somewhat after the lines of the famous roof of Westminster Hall. The floor is of alternating black and white marble. The chapel was designed to seat 350 boys, with the west balcony reserved for household staff. Memorials In 1914, 927 Leysians joined the armed services and 146 of them died. A memorial to the old Leysians who died, costing ¬£48,000 and funded by donation, was on 6 June 1920 unveiled by the Duke of York. The memorial consists of four rows of names divided in the middle by a statue of an armoured St George, below which is written \\"To The Immortal Memory of Old Leysians Who Fell In The War Of 1914‚Äì1919\\", and in large block capitals the words \\"My Marks And Scars With Me To Be A Witness For Me That I Have Fought His Battles Who Now Will Be My Reward.\\" Stained Glass The Chapel has fourteen windows; the Governors commissioned H. J. Salisbury to decorate them all according to a unified theme. The work was modelled on the windows of the King's College Chapel, Cambridge. Because the Leys is a Methodist school, the work was required to be simple and avoid complex symbolism. All but one of the windows depicts passages from the New Testament concerning the story of Christ; the large window over the main entrance instead shows ten Old Testament subjects forecasting the coming of the Messiah. The Pulpit The Pulpit is made of oak and has a brass inscription reading \\"To the Glory of God and for the Preaching of His holy word this Pulpit was carved by Anne Hobson, Helen Mary Chubb, and George Hayter Chubb, and presented by the latter to The Leys, October, 1906.\\" Benches There are thirty-two oak benches in The Chapel, thirty with square ends and two with sloping ends.

Ensemble The six- person team consisting of Brian Colonna, Hannah Duggan, Erik Edborg, Erin Rollman, Samantha Schmitz, and Evan Weissman works in a non-hierarchical way in order to collaboratively create all productions. All six members collaborate as playwrights, actors, designers, directors, producers and technicians. History Members of the company began collaborating while attending Colorado College in Colorado Springs, in the late 1990s. The company moved into a cement warehouse, next to a Greek wholesale food distributor at 717 Lipan St. Denver, Colorado in 2000 and renovated it into a fully functioning black box theater with modular seating. Prior to that, they had created a few productions together, touring them to theaters, schools and fringe theatre festivals. As of 2012, Buntport has created 31 main-stage productions and 100 episodes of two \\"live sit-coms\\" (Magnets on the Fridge and Starship Troy). Their all-ages live comic book, tRUNks, has produced over 40 installments.

Buntport has garnered more than 75 awards and many more nominations from newspapers, magazines, television stations and theater educators. Process Buntport Theater Company is well known for their working model as artists and as an organization. Working collaboratively and non-hierarchically forces ideas to be filtered through several minds, encouraging brainstorming and playful experimentation.

To involve people on a regular basis, Buntport created the live sit-com format. During six months of the year, they debuted a new episode of a ‚Äúsit-com‚Äù every other Tuesday and Wednesday night, complete with commercial breaks and summer re-runs. The writing of each episode was inspired by an audience suggestion from the previous episode and often featured guest stars from the Denver theater scene. The first adventure into this field (titled Magnets on the Fridge) became a cult hit, winning numerous awards from the media and critics, and attracting a loyal following. Magnets on the Fridge ran for 5 seasons before being replaced by Starship Troy, which was equally successful and ran for 3 seasons. Buntport finished their live sitcom careers on December 31, 2008 with the 100th episode of their sitcoms. tRUNks Using the format of their live sit-com, a team of the Buntport ensemble's friends and peers creates and performs a family-friendly live comic book called tRUNks, every other Saturday.

It was built in 1918.  History  Pleasant Grove High School was established in 1912. It started in a small one-room building. Additional rooms were eventually added on due to the increasing number of students. The former location was the city's old recreational center. The school was eventually moved to a larger building half a mile away, built in 1959. The new building was not quite large enough, so the 9th grade stayed with the junior high school.Jense, Arlene. Personal Interview by Tyler Harmon. 26 Jan 2010. In 1921, a group of seniors put a block letter \\"G\\" on an unnamed peak west of Mount Timpanogos. The first time the G was lit was in 1929. In 1984 the G was nearly taken down because of maintenance fees. The student body fought to keep the G standing and raised enough money to keep it from being taken down. From then on was celebrated as a Pleasant Grove holiday. It was later removed from holiday status because the grass on the football field was being destroyed by the people celebrating.Jeri Craner. Personal Interview by Jake Grant Harmon. 23 Jan 2010 The G is lit every year for special occasions such as homecoming and graduation. Recently the lighting equipment and generator broke down because of age and use. The 2010-2011 student council started the \\"Light the G\\" fundraiser, spearheaded by student council member Jeremy Jensen. With the help of students and the community, they were able to raise over $5,500 and buy two new 500-watt generators, over 1000 feet of new light cords and new fluorescent light bulbs. The G was lit again for the first time in about three years after the 2010 Homecoming game. In the school‚Äôs early years, the mascot was known as the Pleasant Grove Grovarian. In 1959, when Pleasant Grove switched over schools, the mascot was changed to the Valkyrie. It was similar to the Grover, but the Valkyrie in Norse mythology is an angel of war who chooses which heroes will die in battle. It was later changed to the Viking, which is the current mascot. In August 1972, a fire broke out in the new library. Riley Richards and Chris Varney, two janitors, were killed in the accident. While they were cleaning, volatile fumes filled the room they were in. A spark ignited the fumes, which caused an explosion, killing the two men and starting a raging fire in the library. It took the school approximately five years to fully rebuild the library. It was moved to the lower story of the building and was modified to reduce the chances of such a disaster recurring.

Along with the addition, the school rebuilt their football field with turf and new bleachers, resurfaced their tennis courts, and renovated their home economics classrooms and their weight room. The total approximate size of the school is currently . Pleasant Grove High also had a 16-classroom satellite wing east of the main campus. Prior to the completion of the 2009 addition to the building, this satellite campus was demolished. In 2015, a new main gym (known to students as \\"Valhalla\\" after the warrior paradise in Norse mythology) was completed along with 5 new classrooms. (These include a dance/spin class and weight room.) = Facilities = The approximately campus of PGHS contains tennis courts, a football field, soccer practice fields, a baseball field, and a joint city-school owned softball field. Some sports classes are taught on these fields, while other classes such as dance are taught at the nearby Pleasant Grove Community Center, located at 457 South Locust Avenue, Pleasant Grove, Utah.  Academics  PGHS offers a variety of classes including Vocational (CTE), Advanced Placement (AP), and Concurrent Enrollment (CE) classes. Students can take CE classes to earn college credit during High School. CE offers the possibility to graduate with an associate degree from Utah Valley University (UVU), which is transferable to most other universities located in Utah. CTE stands for Career and Technical Education. CTE classes provide traditionally non-academic skills for specific jobs.Black, Shauna. Interview. 26 Jan 2010. Print. = AP and ACT = In 10-11 PGHS offered a total of 19 Advanced Placement classes, opposed to the 18 it offered in 09-10. 21 percent of all students at PGHS earn credit for at least one Advanced Placement class each year. The most popular Advanced Placement class is Biology, because in addition to credit from the AP test, it also offers CE credit. Other Advanced Placement classes offered are Music, World History, Art, Psychology, Physics and Chemistry. The average ACT score at PGHS is 23.5; the national average is 20.5.

It details MacLaine's journeys through New Age spirituality. The book follows her from southern California to various locations including New York City, Europe, and Hawaii, culminating in a life- changing trip to the Andes Mountains in Peru. Central characters include David who is, according to MacLaine, a composite character; Gerry Stamford, a married man and fictionalized Labour member of the British House of Commons, with whom MacLaine claimed she had a love affair; and real-life close friend and politician, Bella Abzug. The book received both acclaim and criticism for its candor in dealing with such topics as reincarnation, meditation, mediumship (trance-channeling), and even unidentified flying objects. It made Shirley MacLaine the butt of many jokes, especially by late-night television comedians. Once, when David Letterman would not let up on the New Age subject, she responded by saying, \\"Maybe Cher was right; maybe you are an asshole!\\" The claim about an affair with the MP gained attention in the UK when the book was published there. Out on a Limb was adapted for television broadcast in 1987. The five-hour ABC miniseries starred MacLaine (as herself), John Heard as David Manning, and Charles Dance as Gerry Stamford. Anne Jackson played Bella Abzug, and Jerry Orbach played Shirley's agent. MacLaine kept a diary during the filming of the miniseries. The notes were later turned into the book It's All In the Playing. After the publication the former President Jimmy Carter asked MacLaine to talk about UFOs.

Spivak John Louis Spivak (June 13, 1897 ‚Äì September 30, 1981) was an American socialist and later communist reporter and author, who wrote about the problems of the working class, racism, and the spread of fascism in Europe and the United States. Most of his writings date from the 1920s and 1930s. He lived under a pseudonym during the 1950s and 1960s, emerging again to publish his autobiography in 1967 and work as a journalist in the 1970s. Early life and overview As a boy Spivak worked in a number of industrial factories in his hometown of New Haven, Connecticut.Syracuse University Library: Syracuse University Spivak Papers, accessed December 12, 2010 He was attracted to leftist ideas in his teenage years and later wrote that writing was \\"more to me than just a trade I liked; it was a weapon.\\"John L. Spivak, A Man in his Time: An Autobiography (Horizon Press, 1967), 166, 284, 287 He claimed he never joined the Communist Party. In his 1967 autobiography, he described how the 1939 Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact temporarily shook his faith in the Soviet Union as the guardian of radical ideals until he decided that the Soviet Union's survival justified it.Spivak, A Man in his Time, 465 Along with many of his contemporaries, Spivak experimented with new forms of reporting in which the reporter appeared in his stories as an investigator and witness, drawing the reader into his experience. He used the \\"expos√© quotation\\" technique to underscore differences between his subject's words and actions and presented himself as a confrontational interviewer. He dramatized his own research efforts and search for facts on the reader's behalf. He also was up front and open in making clear his political world view so as to disarm the reader's objections to his lack of objectivity. The foremost student of 1930s journalism recognized his achievement: \\"A large share of the period's expos√© s were his.\\"William Stott, Documentary Expression and Thirties America (University of Chicago Press, 1973), 33-6, 54, 173-4, 179, 183-6, quote 34n Spivak cooperated with the predecessors of the Soviet KGB in the 1930s, perhaps from as early as 1932. KGB reports indicated that the Soviets particularly valued information he obtained from sources at U.S. Congressional committees. He obtained material that included details about the German government's financing and sponsorship of Nazi activity in the U.S. as well as documents related to munitions and chemical weapons research. The KGB also used Spivak as a source of information about [Trotskyists], its ideological enemies on the left. The KGB appears to have changed its mind about his usefulness more than once, so Spivak's relationship to the KGB was intermittent for more than a decade.John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev, Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America (Yale University Press, 2009), 161-7, 476 Career Spivak landed his first job as a police reporter for the New Haven Union. He moved to New York where he worked at the Morning Sun, Evening Graphic, and The Call, the paper of the American Socialist Party. His first major story came when he covered the Battle of Matewan in West Virginia. He then served briefly as a reporter and bureau chief in Berlin and Moscow for the International News Service.New York Times: \\"John Spivak, Reporter And Political Crusader,\\" October 3, 1981, accessed December 10, 2010 Upon his return to the United States, he became a feature writer for leftist newspapers and magazines such as the Communist Party USA's Daily Worker, Ken, and the New Masses. In 1930, in a case known as the \\"Whalen Papers,\\" Spivak used his position as a journalist on behalf of the Soviet Union. When documents detailing Soviet propaganada efforts came into the possession of the New York City Police Department, Spivak quickly demonstrated they were forgeries. Only years later did it transpire that the documents were supplied by the Soviets so that Spivak, alert to the scheme, could discredit them and thereby undermine Congressional efforts to investigate Communist propaganda in the United States.Martin J. Manning with Herbert Romerstein, Historical Dictionary of American Propaganda (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004), 317-8 Spivak traveled throughout the South in the early 1930s interviewing prison camp officials and photographing camp practices and punishment records. His novel, Georgia Nigger, depicting the brutality of peonage labor and chain gangs, was serialized several newspapers, including the Daily Worker and the Des Moines Tribune.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Georgia Nigger, January 14, 2005, accessed December 14, 2010 Soon after it appeared in 1932, an academic study called it \\"a second Uncle Tom's Cabin, an indictment of peonage and convict-labor in Georgia, powerful enough to put to shame all the rhapsodists of the folk Negro's happy state.\\"Sterling A. Brown, \\"The Negro Awakening,\\" in James A. Emanuel, ed., Dark symphony: Negro Literature in America (NY: Free Press, 1968), 170; Sterling A. Brown, \\"Negro Character as seen by White Authors,\\" Journal of Negro Education, vol. 2 (1933), 202-3 Another reviewer thought it posed \\"a moral challenge\\" but disliked its exaggerations and the author's \\"superciliousness.\\"Ben N. Azikiwe, review of Georgia Nigger in Journal of Negro History, vol. 18 (1933), 216-20 The book carried an appendix with photographs and documents designed to document the novel's descriptions of torture.New York Times: \\"Prof. Huxley Here; Talks on his Verse,\\" September 30, 1932, accessed December 14, 2010 \\"Thus his novel,\\" wrote one reviewer, \\"in addition to the dramatic force of an interesting and well-told story, has the weight and authority of a sociological investigation.\\"New York Times: \\"Miss Latimer's Stories and Other Recent Works of Fiction,\\" October 16, 1932, accessed December 14, 2010 Just a few weeks after the book appeared, Spivak testified with other experts on the Georgia penal system in a successful attempt to persuade New Jersey Governor A. Harry Moore to refuse to extradite a fugitive from a Georgia chain gang.New York Times: \\"Burns Extradition Refused by Moore,\\" December 22, 1932, accessed December 14, 2010 In 1934, some of Spivak's New Masses articles on anti-Semitism in the U.S. were reprinted as a 93-page pamphlet called Plotting America's Pogroms.William W. Brickman, The Jewish Community in America: An Annotated and Classified Bibliographical Guide (NY: Burt Franklin & Co., 1977), 224: \\"A Marxist interpretation of organized anti-Semitism in the United States in the light of the class struggle.\\" His 1935 expos√© in the Communist Party's New Masses charged a congressional committee with deliberately suppressing evidence of an offer made to retired Marine General Smedley D. Butler by Wall Street financiers (the Business Plot) to lead a military coup against the U.S. government and replace it with a fascist regime. Butler was supposedly, \\"offered $3,000,000 to organize a fascist army with a promise of $300,000,000 more if it became necessary.\\"COAT: John L. Spivak, \\"Wall Street's Fascist Conspiracy\\" (photographic reproduction), New Masses, January 29 and February 5, 1935, accessed December 15, 2010; John L. Spivak, \\"Wall Street's Fascist Conspiracy Part 1\\", New Masses, January 29, 1935], accessed December 15, 2010 Spivak argued that the plot was part of a \\"conspiracy of Jewish financiers working with fascist groups\\", referring specifically to Felix Warburg, the McCormack‚ÄìDickstein Committee, and certain members of the American Jewish Committee in collusion with J. P. Morgan. Hans Schmidt concludes that while Spivak made a cogent argument for taking the suppressed testimony seriously, he embellished his article with his \\"overblown\\" claims regarding Jewish financiers, which Schmidt dismisses as guilt by association not supported by the evidence of the Butler- MacGuire conversations themselves. Most of Spivak's work was dedicated to supporting communism, exposing capitalism, fascism and underground Nazi spy groups in Central America, Europe, and the U.S. In March 1935, the last issue of the American Spectator gave its award for \\"best reporting\\" to Spivak for his articles in New Masses on Nazi and anti-Semitic activity in the U.S.Time: \\"Press: Retiring Spectators,\\" March 11, 1935, accessed December 14, 2010 Spivak announced the thesis of America Faces the Barricades (1935) in the preface: \\"I think that the capitalist system in this country still has some distance to go before it falls....We are in for a period of great unrest, organized and unorganized revolts and bloodshed; a period, I think, which will continue until the present economic system has been completely changed.\\"John L. Spivak, America Faces the Barricades (NY: Covici-Friede, 1935), viii-ix Time provided its readers with a brief description of : \\"Misleadingly titled collection of sober reports on conditions and states of mind among the unemployed, California migratory workers, Southern sharecroppers and other distressed groups, written by one of the ablest of U.S. radical journalists.\\"Time: \\"Fiction: Recent Books: Aug. 12, 1935\\", accessed December 14, 2010 Another review said Spivak \\"used to be a first-class reporter,\\" and while granting that \\"One does not doubt Mr. Spivak's facts,\\" said that \\"It is the pattern that seems overdrawn.\\"New York Times: John Chamberlain, \\"Books of the Times,\\" August 6, 1935, accessed December 16, 2010; Chamberlain compared Spivak's work in Barricades unfavorably to James Rorty's Where Life is Better a few months later; New York Times: John Chamberlain, \\"Books of the Times,\\" January 17, 1936, accessed December 16, 2010For a negative response that calls Spivak a \\"rather clever and unscrupulous propagandist\\" and resents his focus on Nazi anti-Semitism in America, see Arthur C. Inman, The Inman Diary: A Public and Private Confession (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985), Daniel Aaron, ed., 647 (August 9, 1935) A more appreciative reviewer found Spivak \\"natively fair-minded and realistic,\\" but doubted his conclusions, especially his assessment of the threat of domestic Nazism and anti-Semitism: \\"[He] seems to take fools too seriously. Mr. Spivak is in danger of being as credulous of the claims of counter-revolution as some of our eminent citizens are of the claims of revolution.\\"New York Times: R.L. Duffus, \\"The American Worker Today,\\" July 28, 1935, accessed December 16, 2010 Spivak toured parts of Europe and produced a portrait of the continent in Europe under the Terror (1936). Time found it interesting enough to summarize at length, country by country: \\"Italy's tyrants, suggests Spivak, are clowns, its people poltroons.\\"; \\"Germany's tyrants Spivak describes as super-efficient grafting gangsters, its people dolts.\\"; \\"Poland's tyrants, according to Spivak, are amiable, intelligent playboys, its people hopeless serfs.\\" In sum:Time: \\"International: Dictators Dissected,\\" May 25, 1936, accessed December 15, 2010 > Europe Under the Terror, like the peasants' potatoes, must be taken with a > little salt.

Author Spivak is a shade too ready to > forecast the collapse of tyrannies, to overestimate the potency of the > rebellious spirit. His book is valuable as a document of a kind that rarely > emerges from the censored murk of dictatorship. British diplomat turned academic E.H. Carr found it \\"ambitious\\" and partly interesting, and wished Spivak had covered some harder to study regions.E.H. Carr, International Affairs, vol. 15 (1936), 769-70 Columbia University Soviet specialist Michael T. Florinsky dissected Spivak's reporting. He noted that Spivak's style appealed to both the New Masses and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal because his work lacked the attributes of \\"high-class journalism\\": \\"objectivity, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and a sense of proportion.\\" He found nothing new about the rulers except \\"fantastic stories about the German and Italian spy system,\\" yet was moved by Spivak's \\"real feeling for the underdog.\\" He cited statements \\"in flagrant contradiction with easily ascertainable facts,\\" a complete misunderstanding of German agricultural policy, and a tale of Nazi officials trying to smuggle German marks abroad that would not be convertible into any other currency. He summarized:New York Times: \\"Mr. Spivak's Adventures in Fascist States,\\" May 24, 1936, accessed December 15, 2010 > These and other gross distortions of facts are particularly regrettable > because they make it difficult to accept on its face value Mr. Spivak's > evidence on the development of the revolutionary movement in the countries > he visited, evidence that cannot be checked from their sources.

Another New York Times reviewer described it as \\"a clever attempt to pick out the threads of fear, misery and venality in the texture of Central Europe today, not with a scholar's fine point but with the blunt stub of a partisan.\\" \\"Mr. Spivak is an artist in black and white and can't be bothered with intermediary shades of color....If, in your opinion, striking contrasts and brilliant writing can compensate for oversimplification and ingenuousness, Mr. Spivak is the man for your money.\\"New York Times: Ralph Thompson, \\"Books of the Times,\\" May 11, 1936, accessed December 15, 2010 Under the sponsorship of New Masses, Spivak toured the United States in 1936 delivering a lecture on the dangers of fascism called \\"I Saw.\\"Stott, 34n In October 1937, Spivak testified before a Massachusetts legislative commission investigating Communist, fascist, and Nazi activities, describing a nationwide Nazi propaganda network and accusing two employees of Henry Ford, among others, of distributing Nazi propaganda.New York Times: \\"Says Ford Men Aid Nazi Efforts Here,\\" October 14, 1937, accessed December 15, 2010 He identified another witness as a distributor of Nazi propaganda, who in turn said Spivak was being paid by the Communist Party.New York Time: \\"Brandeis Called 'Invisible' Power,\\" October 26, 1937, accessed December 15, 2010 In a sort of sequel to Secret Armies, Honorable Spy (1939) described smuggling and war preparations on the part of West Coast Japanese in collusion with Nazis, hiding weapons in Mexico, and spying on American defense installations with telescopic lenses. One review followed a summation of its charges with an evaluation: \\"How much of what Mr. Spivak sees and hears is true, we do not know. But we trust that Mr. Hoover's F.B.I. officials. as well as the Mexican government, will look sharply into these activities.\\"Sidney B. Fay, Books Abroad, vol. 14 (1940), 267 In 1940, he was arrested for criminal libel because of charges he made in Secret Armies that an investigator for the House Un-American Activities Committee and a German instructor at Wichita State University were Nazi agents.David Riesman, \\"Democracy and Defamation: Fair Game and Fair Comment I,\\" in Columbia Law Review, vol. 42 (1942), 1091n; New York Times: \\"Spivak Returned to Jail,\\" April 2, 1940, accessed December 12, 2010 Spivak also investigated the financial activities of Charles E. Coughlin, the Catholic radio priest who founded the National Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Michigan.Steven Carr, Hollywood and Anti-semitism: A Cultural History up to World War II (NY: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 84, 114 One author described Spivak's combination of documentation and advocacy in Shrine of the Silver Dollar (1940) as \\"in the nature of investigative reporting.\\"Ronald H. Carpenter, Father Charles E. Coughlin: Surrogate Spokesman for the Disaffected (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1998), 22n A review of the historical literature on Coughlin places a sympathetic biography at one end of the scale and Spivak's \\"rabid\\" study at the other, calling Shrine \\"a primary document of the brown scare,\\" that is, an unwarranted and hysterical fear of a right-wing overthrow of the federal government.John F. Wilson, ed., Church and State in America: A Bibliographic Guide, The Civil War to the Present Day (Project on Church and State, Princeton University, 1987), 194.

Wald, Trinity of Passion: The Literary Left and the Antifascist Crusade (University of North Carolina Press, 2007), 144 With the rise of McCarthyism, Spivak spent much of the 1950s and 1960s writing under several pen names for men's magazines including Cavalier, Esquire, Fury, Male, and Man to Man. He lived for 2 decades under the pseudonym Monroe Fry. Esquire published a collection of his short fiction, \\"lurid stories about easy women, prostitutes, and other 'favors' routinely enjoyed by the middle-class dad on a sales trip,\\" as Sex, Vice and Business by Monroe Fry.Megan Hustad, How to Be Useful: A Beginner's Guide to Not Hating Work (NY: Houghton Mifflin, 2008), 112 One review described its treatment of the subject as \\"slightly sensationalized.\\"The Humanist, vol. 75-76, 341 He and his wife, Mabel, retired to their farm in Easton, Pennsylvania. Assuming the name John L. Spivak once more, in 1967 he published his autobiography, A Man in His Time, which covered his life up to 1939. Reviewing it for the New York Times, veteran liberal journalist Gerald W. Johnson wrote that Spivak's style of journalism, committed to \\"the exposure of villains\\" and \\"dramatic intensity,\\" produces in the end \\"a distinct aura of mythology.\\" Citing Spivak's account of the Liberty League's conspiracy to depose Roosevelt, Johnson acknowledged a certain basis in reality but called Spivak's account \\"pretty farfetched.\\" Johnson praised Spivak's enduring optimism and skills as a writer: \\"As a pictorial writer, he is deft, evoking with a line or two a picture that a less competent hand would take a page to limn.\\" He described the work's content, however, as \\"a series of impressions of an observer, highly skillful, but highly unscientific....It needs to be balanced and corrected by the work of historians trained in a more rigorous professional discipline.\\"New York Times: Gerald W. Jonson, \\"Sound the Alarm,\\" September 24, 1967\\", accessed January 10, 2011; Spivak's account of the 1930s \\"conspiracy\\" in his autobiography is detailed, but markedly different in both tone and content from his articles decades earlier in New Masses. From 1968 to 1973 he wrote a consumer affairs column called \\"Action! Express\\" for the Easton Express, a newspaper based in Easton, Pennsylvania. His work led to a federal investigation of sales tactics used by magazine circulation companies. Spivak died in Philadelphia in 1981, six months after his wife died. They had been married for 64 years and were survived by a daughter and grandson.

It is also called the Vandermonde determinant, as it is the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix. The value depends on the order of the terms: it is an alternating polynomial, not a symmetric polynomial.  Alternating  The defining property of the Vandermonde polynomial is that it is alternating in the entries, meaning that permuting the X_i by an odd permutation changes the sign, while permuting them by an even permutation does not change the value of the polynomial ‚Äì in fact, it is the basic alternating polynomial, as will be made precise below. It thus depends on the order, and is zero if two entries are equal ‚Äì this also follows from the formula, but is also consequence of being alternating: if two variables are equal, then switching them both does not change the value and inverts the value, yielding V_n = -V_n, and thus V_n = 0 (assuming the characteristic is not 2, otherwise being alternating is equivalent to being symmetric). Conversely, the Vandermonde polynomial is a factor of every alternating polynomial: as shown above, an alternating polynomial vanishes if any two variables are equal, and thus must have (X_i - X_j) as a factor for all i eq j. = Alternating polynomials = Thus, the Vandermonde polynomial (together with the symmetric polynomials) generates the alternating polynomials.  Discriminant  Its square is widely called the discriminant, though some sources call the Vandermonde polynomial itself the discriminant. The discriminant (the square of the Vandermonde polynomial: \\\\Delta=V_n^2) does not depend on the order of terms, as (-1)^2=1, and is thus an invariant of the unordered set of points. If one adjoins the Vandermonde polynomial to the ring of symmetric polynomials in n variables \\\\Lambda_n, one obtains the quadratic extension \\\\Lambda_n[V_n]/\\\\langle V_n^2-\\\\Delta\\\\rangle, which is the ring of alternating polynomials.  Vandermonde polynomial of a polynomial  Given a polynomial, the Vandermonde polynomial of its roots is defined over the splitting field; for a non-monic polynomial, with leading coefficient a, one may define the Vandermonde polynomial as :V_n = a^{n-1}\\\\prod_{1\\\\le i (multiplying with a leading term) to accord with the discriminant. Generalizations Over arbitrary rings, one instead uses a different polynomial to generate the alternating polynomials ‚Äì see (Romagny, 2005). =Weyl character formula= (a vast generalization) The Vandermonde polynomial can be considered a special case of the Weyl character formula, specifically the Weyl denominator formula (the case of the trivial representation) of the special unitary group \\\\mathrm{SU}(n).
