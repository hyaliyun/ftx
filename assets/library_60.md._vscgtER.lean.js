Because of its remote location outside Slovenia, the dialect has phonetic properties different from standard Slovene, and from most other Slovene dialects. Many, arguably the majority, of its speakers consider it a separate language. Pater Noster in the old Resian dialect Characteristics Although not a regulated dialect (scholars consider it a dialect of Slovene rather than a different language), and without any official status in Italy, Resian is written with a Latin script different from that used for standard Slovene. The alphabet contains the letter , a letter that few Slavic languages use (only Polish, Kashubian and Upper and Lower Sorbian). This grapheme‚Äîaccording to the Italian linguist Bartoli‚Äîis characteristic of the Ladin language of the eastern Alps and indicates the autochthonous Neolatin population's strong influence on Resian. = Historical development and linguistic features = A bilingual sign in Italian and Resian in the Resia Valley Most contemporary scholars consider Resian a transitional dialect between the Carinthian and Littoral dialects of Slovene. Linguists identify three historical layers in the development of Resian. Initially, Resian was a part of the Carinthian Gail Valley dialect (spoken south of Villach, Austria, but also in the Italian municipalities of Malborghetto Valbruna and Tarvisio, and in the towns of Rateƒçe and Kranjska Gora in Slovenia). In the 14th century, with the German and Friulian colonization of the Canale and Raccolana valleys, the connection of Resian with Carinthian dialects was interrupted. Starting from the 15th century, Resian acquired specific features of Venetian Slovenian dialects (especially the vocabulary). The third layer is represented by specific innovations and developments, which are unique to Resian and cannot be found in any other Slovene dialect. In addition, Resian has maintained a number of archaisms (including the aorist) that have disappeared both in standard Slovene and most other Slovene dialects. Atypical for a Slavic language, Resian has a definite article: masculine te, feminine ta (the only standard Slavic languages to contain definite articles are Bulgarian and Macedonian). This historical development helps to understand the specifics of Resian in regards to other Slovene dialects. Regarding the vocabulary, Resian is very similar to other western Slovene dialects, both from the Littoral and Carinthian dialect group: especially the Natisone Valley dialect, Torre Valley dialect, Gail Valley dialect, Brda dialect and upper Soƒça dialect. It however distinguishes sharply from these neighboring dialects in its phonetics. Resian sounds very different from other Slovene dialects, especially regarding the vowel system; nevertheless, some of its features are common to the Carinthian dialect group. = Mutual intelligibility with Slovene = Written Resian can mostly be understood by Slovenes, but spoken Resian is much harder to understand, especially for those from central and eastern Slovenia. Resian forms a part of the South Slavic dialect continuum, and shares numerous features with the dialects spoken in the Slovenian Littoral and Venetian Slovenia, and communication between these communities is intelligible. However, Resian and standard Slovene are mutually unintelligible due to archaisms lost in modern Slovene, and due to significant Italian and Friulian influences on Resian vocabulary.  Scholars  Notable linguists who have studied the dialect include Jan Niecis≈Çaw Baudouin de Courtenay, Eric Hamp, Milko Matiƒçetov, and Roberto Dapit.

Like bruises in other tissues, cerebral contusion can be associated with multiple microhemorrhages, small blood vessel leaks into brain tissue. Contusion occurs in 20‚Äì30% of severe head injuries. A cerebral laceration is a similar injury except that, according to their respective definitions, the pia-arachnoid membranes are torn over the site of injury in laceration and are not torn in contusion. The injury can cause a decline in mental function in the long term and in the emergency setting may result in brain herniation, a life-threatening condition in which parts of the brain are squeezed past parts of the skull. Thus treatment aims to prevent dangerous rises in intracranial pressure, the pressure within the skull. Contusions are likely to heal on their own without medical intervention.Sanders MJ and McKenna K. 2001. Mosby‚Äôs Paramedic Textbook, 2nd revised Ed. Chapter 22, \\"Head and Facial Trauma.\\" Mosby. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of a cerebral contusion depend on the severity of the injury, ranging from minor to severe. Individuals may experience a headache, confusion, sleepiness, dizziness, loss of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, seizures, difficulty with coordination and movement, lightheadedness, tinnitus, and spinning sensations. They may also have difficulty with memory, vision, speech, hearing, managing emotions, and thinking. Signs also depend on the contusion's location in the brain. Causes The interior of the skull has sharp ridges by which a moving brain can be injured. Often caused by a blow to the head, contusions commonly occur in coup or contre-coup injuries. In coup injuries, the brain is injured directly under the area of impact, while in contrecoup injuries it is injured on the side opposite the impact. Contusions occur primarily in the cortical tissue, especially under the site of impact or in areas of the brain located near sharp ridges on the inside of the skull. The brain may be contused when it collides with bony protuberances on the inside surface of the skull. The protuberances are located on the inside of the skull under the frontal and temporal lobes and on the roof of the ocular orbit.Shepherd S. 2004. \\"Head Trauma.\\" Emedicine.com. Retrieved on 2008-01-10. Thus, the tips of the frontal and temporal lobes located near the bony ridges in the skull are areas where contusions frequently occur and are most severe.Graham DI and Gennareli TA. Chapter 5, \\"Pathology of Brain Damage After Head Injury\\" Cooper P and Golfinos G. 2000. Head Injury, 4th Ed. Morgan Hill, New York. For this reason, attention, emotional and memory problems, which are associated with damage to frontal and temporal lobes, are much more common in head trauma survivors than are syndromes associated with damage to other areas of the brain.Bigler, ED. 2000. The Lesion(s) in Traumatic Brain Injury: Implications for Clinical Neuropsychology. Accessed through web archive. Retrieved on 2008-01-17. Features Contusions, which are frequently associated with edema, are especially likely to cause increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) and concomitant crushing of delicate brain tissue. They typically form in a wedge-shape with the widest part in the outermost part of the brain.Vinas FC and Pilitsis J. 2006. \\"Penetrating Head Trauma.\\" Emedicine.com. Retrieved on 2008-01-10. The distinction between contusion and intracerebral hemorrhage is blurry because both involve bleeding within the brain tissue; however, an arbitrary cutoff exists that the injury is a contusion if two thirds or less of the tissue involved is blood and a hemorrhage otherwise. The contusion may cause swelling of the surrounding brain tissue, which may be irritated by toxins released in the contusion. The swelling is worst at around four to six days after the injury. Extensive contusion associated with subdural hematoma is called burst lobe. Cases of a burst frontal or temporal lobe are associated with high mortality and morbidity. Old or remote contusions are associated with resorption of the injured tissue, resulting in various degrees of cavitation, in addition to the presence of a golden-yellow discoloration due to residual hemosiderin. These remote contusions are often referred to as plaque jaune or yellow plaque. =Multiple petechial hemorrhages= Numerous small contusions from broken capillaries that occur in grey matter under the cortex are called multiple petechial hemorrhages or multifocal hemorrhagic contusion. Caused by shearing injuries at the time of impact, these contusions occur especially at the junction between grey and white matter and in the upper brain stem, basal ganglia, thalamus and areas near the third ventricle. The hemorrhages can occur as the result of brain herniation, which can cause arteries to tear and bleed. A type of diffuse brain injury, multiple petechial hemorrhages are not always visible using current imaging techniques like CT and MRI scans. This may be the case even if the injury is quite severe, though these may show up days after the injury.Downie A. 2001. \\"Tutorial: CT in Head Trauma\\" . Retrieved May 8, 2008 Hemorrhages may be larger than in normal contusions if the injury is quite severe. This type of injury has a poor prognosis if the patient is comatose, even with no apparent causes for the coma. Treatment MRI showing damage due to herniation in a patient who had had contusions in the frontal lobes. Since cerebral swelling presents a danger to the patient, treatment of cerebral contusion aims to prevent swelling. Measures to avoid swelling include prevention of hypotension (low blood pressure), hyponatremia (insufficient sodium), and hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide in the blood). Due to the danger of increased intracranial pressure, surgery may be necessary to reduce it. People with cerebral contusion may require intensive care and close monitoring.

Poor law unions existed in England and Wales from 1834 to 1930 for the administration of poor relief. Prior to the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the administration of the English Poor Laws was the responsibility of the vestries of individual parishes, which varied widely in their size, populations, financial resources, rateable values and requirements. From 1834 the parishes were grouped into unions, jointly responsible for the administration of poor relief in their areas and each governed by a board of guardians. A parish large enough to operate independently of a union was known as a poor law parish. Collectively, poor law unions and poor law parishes were known as poor law districts. The grouping of the parishes into unions caused larger centralised workhouses to be built to replace smaller facilities in each parish. Poor law unions were later used as a basis for the delivery of registration from 1837, and sanitation outside urban areas from 1875. Poor law unions were abolished by the Local Government Act 1929, which transferred responsibility for public assistance to county and county borough councils. England and Wales The English Poor Laws laid out the system of poor relief that existed in England and Wales from the reign of Elizabeth I until the emergence of the modern welfare state after the Second World War. Historian Mark Blaug has argued that the Poor Law system provided \\"a welfare state in miniature, relieving the elderly, widows, children, the sick, the disabled, and the unemployed and underemployed\\".Blaug, Mark. \\"The Poor Law Report Re-examined.\\" Journal of Economic History (1964) 24: 229‚Äì45 The functions of poor law unions were exercised by boards of guardians, partly elected by ratepayers, but also including magistrates. Some parishes, many in the metropolitan area of London, were able to avoid amalgamation into unions because of earlier local acts that regulated their poor law administration. The Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 allowed the Poor Law Board to include these parishes in unions.Poverty and Poor Law Reform in Nineteenth-Century Britain, 1834‚Äì1914, David Englander (2013) Until 1894 the guardians consisted of justices of the peace along with other members elected by rate-payers, with higher rate-payers having more votes. JPs were removed and plural voting stopped in 1894, but nobody actually receiving poor relief was allowed to vote. Their areas were espoused for other functional districts, such as civil registration of all births, marriages and deaths which became law from 1837 and rural sanitary districts established in 1875. In 1894 rural districts and urban districts were set up based on the sanitary districts (and therefore indirectly on the unions). In 1930, under the Local Government Act 1929, the poor law unions were finally abolished and their responsibilities transferred to the county councils and county boroughs. Ireland Under the Irish Poor Law Act of 1838, three Poor Law Commissioners\\" divided Ireland into poor law unions, in which paupers would receive poor relief paid for by a poor rate extracted by local poor law valuations (ratings of rate payers). The name \\"union\\" was retained from the English model although boundaries were unrelated to civil parishes. A union was named after the town on which it was centred, usually where its workhouse stood. Unions were defined as groups of poor law electoral divisions, in turn groups of townlands. Electoral divisions returned members (guardians) to the board of guardians, to which ratepayers who paid higher rates had more votes. During and after the Great Famine, the impoverished west was redrawn to create more unions for easier administration and for computation of where suffering was most endemic. When the Irish General Register Office was established in 1864, each union became a superintendent registrar's district, thus electoral divisions together formed a dispensary or registrar's district. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 divided administrative counties into urban and rural districts, with each rural district corresponding to the non-urban portion of a poor law union within the county. In the Irish Free State poor law unions and rural districts were abolished in 1925 and the powers of boards of guardians transferred to the county councils' Board of Health. In Northern Ireland, poor law unions survived until the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Service in 1948. Scotland The Poor Law in Scotland was reformed by the Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845. Poorhouses (as workhouses were generally known in Scotland) were organised at parish level. The Act permitted, but did not require, parishes to join together to build and operate poorhouses. A union of parishes operating a single poorhouse was known as a Combination.

First described in 1986, it is caused by the bacterium \\"Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis\\", which attacks the lining of the abalone's digestive tract, inhibiting the production of digestive enzymes. To prevent starvation, the abalone consumes its own body mass, causing its characteristic muscular \\"foot\\" to wither and atrophy. This impairs the abalone's ability to adhere to rocks, making it far more vulnerable to predation. Withered abalone not eaten by predators typically starve. For reasons not yet well understood, some abalone can be infected with the bacterium without developing the disease. It is believed, however, that changes in environmental conditions, such as warmer than normal water temperatures, may induce the disease in abalone that already harbor the bacterium. For this reason, the spread of the bacterium could lead to further declines in abalone populations, especially during El Ni√±o events, when water temperatures rise. Once a valuable fishery, abalone in Southern and Central California have been decimated by this disease. Some populations of black abalone have declined nearly 99 percent since the disease was first observed in the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara.

Later, a two-story arc appeared in \\"The Super Friends\\" issues #45 & #46 (June & July 1981) where Olympian once again teamed up with several international heroes and The Super Friends. Olympian later appeared in DC Comics Presents #46 (June 1982), it was the first time that he and the other international heroes were working as a team, under the name The Global Guardians. He was created by Nelson Bridwell and Alex Saviuk. The second Olympian first appeared in Wonder Woman (volume 3) #30 (May 2009) and was created by Gail Simone. Fictional character biography =Aristides Demetrios= Aristides Demetrios is a Greek national who wears the mythical Golden Fleece, which grants him the strength of Hercules and various other powers connected to the heroes who comprised the Argonauts. He aids Wonder Woman battling Colonel Conquest in Greece, where a bomb was supposed to be hidden. In one incident, he helps Superman stop a gathering of mystical artifacts designed to bring back the villain Thaumar Dhai. They encounter Echidne, an old adversary of the Olympian, a beautiful woman with a long, gigantic snake form instead of legs. Olympian would later join Superman and many fellow Guardians on Easter Island. They would again battle Echidne and her fellow mystics. Dhai's mystical return is reversed and he is seemingly destroyed. The Greek hero later meets Fury of Infinity Inc.. While in possession of the Golden Fleece, Aristedes can use any of the skills, powers and natural abilities possessed by any of the fifty original Argonauts. These abilities include the power of Hercules, the precognitive abilities of Idmon, the telescopic and x-ray vision of Lynceus, the speed of Atalanta, wisdom of Admetus, the memory of Aethalides, ability to walk on water like Euphemus, the flight ability of Zetes & Calais, the shapeshifting ability of Periclymenus, and the invulnerability of Achilles. Olympian is a founding member of the Global Guardians. As detailed in a flashback, Olympian protests when the original 'Ice', otherwise known as Icemaiden leaves the Global Guardians because of her feelings of inadequacy. When he learned that his fellow members of the Global Guardians were to be supported by the Bialyan dictator Queen Bee, Olympian joins up. An unwitting participant in a public relations ploy, the Olympian helps his teammates and Justice League Europe battle a giant, alien robot on the grounds of the League's embassy. This robot was sent by the Queen Bee herself, using technology stolen from a now-dead member of the alien Dominators. The Queen did not care if the robot ended up killing any of the Guardians. The Olympian and Godiva help save nearby confused well-wishers from being crushed when the robot, damaged, threatens to fall on them. After the Queen Bee dies, her successor diagnoses his condition as schizophrenia and arrests him. He later reunites with the other Global Guardians and remains a member since. A romantic relationship with Dorcas Leigh (Godiva) his teammate in the Global Guardians is interrupted when an ancient villain named Fain Y'Onia attacks the duo in London. A brief battle with Fain Y'Onia leaves them both injured and Godiva apparently powerless. Other Guardians were apparently rendered powerless by the villain and Bushmaster was slain. The Olympian rallies with the able-bodied members of the Guardians and ambushes Fain in the Arizona desert. During the battle, Tuatara is badly injured and Thunderlord is slain. The Wild Huntsman and Fain Y'Onia vanish from this reality. The Olympian is the one who theorizes that the Huntsman's final purpose was to do exactly that and that both will return one day.\\"Justice League Quarterly\\" #17 (Winter 1994) The Olympian is later seen as a member of the Ultramarine Corps. During his time with the group he falls under the mental control of Gorilla Grodd. The Olympian nearly kills Martian Manhunter and Aquaman. Grodd is defeated and most of the Corps travel to another universe. The Olympian later appears in Infinite Crisis #4. He is part of a group of mystically-aligned beings who make a failed attempt to gain the aid of the Spectre. He is briefly seen in #6, working with many other people, from the military to other heroes, including Owlwoman. They fight a holding battle to protect the city of Metropolis from the Secret Society of Supervillains. The Olympain returns in Wonder Girl #4 (February 2008) as the guardian of Cassandra Sandsmark and her mother Helena, a position appointed to him by Zeus. During this storyline it is revealed that he and Cassandra's mother, Helena Sandsmark, have romantic feelings for one another. =Achilles Warkiller= Zeus created him when he felt that the female Amazons had failed in their mission and a new race of all-male heroes would need to rise to carry out his plans. Named Achilles and charged as the new leader of the Gargareans, he was created from the heart of the Hawaiian god Kane Milohai.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #30 (May 2009) He eventually becomes an ally to the Amazon princess. At one point, he is crowned the King of Themyscira (replacing Hippolyta and for political reasons chose the Amazon Alkyone as his Queen). However, Alkyone plotted to kill Princess Diana (as part of her overall quest to return Hippolyta to the throne). Achilles and Diana worked together and overthrew Alkyone.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #33 (August 2009) Later, Diana introduced Achilles to a man named Patrick Cleese, whom he recognized as the reincarnation of his beloved Patroclus from ancient times. He eventually settles in Markovia and joins the Outsiders. Sexuality In the Wonder Woman stories, Achilles marries a female Amazon for purely political purposes. After the dissolution of their marriage, he is introduced to a man that he believes is the reincarnation of Patroclus, with whom he had a relationship during ancient times.

This site is the southernmost site that has been located in North America, where mass bison hunts have taken place. History Bonfire Shelter is located in Texas Bison hunting was performed as \\"bison jumps\\" which involved stampeding a herd of bison over a cliff, and then butchering the dead animals. In the shelter, there are two distinct zones of bison bones. Each zone represents several bison jumps over relatively little time, perhaps no more than 50‚Äì100 years, but the two zones occurred nearly 7500 years apart. The earlier bones are dated to Paleo-Indian period hunts, while the later occurred in around 500 BC. The site was originally investigated by legendary Texas archaeologist David S. Dibble. Mile Canyon bison jump site Archaeologist Vaughn Bryant has investigated this strange lack of intermediate hunts. Using pollen samples, he discovered that the area had seen good grass cover for grazing only twice since 10,000 BC, and that each time coincided with a deposit of bones. At other times, this area was too inhospitable to support large herds of grazing animals. Bonfire Shelter demonstrates the correlation between climatic changes and the archaeological evidence we can find today. Mile Canyon, where Bonfire Shelter is located, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 AD. The historic district comprises a 1,500 acre (6 km2) area which is entirely on privately owned land. References Fagan, Brian. Ancient North America. Thames & Hudson, London. 2005, p 125.

Turkey's judicial system has been wholly integrated with the system of continental Europe. For instance, the Turkish Civil Code has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the Swiss Civil Code and Code of Obligations, and the German Commercial Code. The Administrative Code bears similarities with its French counterpart, and the Penal Code with its Italian counterpart. The legal profession The general term for members of the legal profession in Turkey is hukuk√ßu. In Turkey, any man or woman, after having graduated from a law faculty at a university, can become avukat (attorney-at-law or barrister), h√¢kim or yargƒ±√ß (judge), savcƒ± (prosecutor) or noter (notary or public notary) after terms of internship specified in separate laws. However, for the judges and prosecutors before getting the title of training judge (stajyer), they have to pass through a written exam which is held by √ñSYM (Student Selection and Placement Center of Turkey) and an interview carried out by a Committee mainly consisting of judges. =Lawyers (Attorneys)= Private lawyers spend one year of traineeship and then join a bar association (baro) and the Union of Turkish Bar Associations. All Turkish lawyers are required to wear black robes in court. =Judges= The Turkish court system does not recognize the concept of a jury. Verdicts for both criminal and civil trials are decided by a judge, or usually a panel of three judges, who have to base their verdicts on the law and their conviction. A judge is also a law school graduate and can be one of the following: * Criminal Judge (wears a black robe with a red collar), * Civil Judge (wears a black robe with a green collar), * Administrative Judge (wears a black robe with a light brown collar).Images of the robes can be found on the website of H.Argun Bozkurt The criminal judges serve at a penal court. These courts (mahkemeler) are separated into aƒüƒ±r ceza (assize court), asliye ceza (penal court of first instance), and sulh ceza (penal court of peace). The civil judges serve at civil courts of first instance or at civil courts of peace (sulh or asliye hukuk mahkemeleri), while administrative judges serve in administrative courts (idari mahkemeler).Description of the various courts in Turkey Interpol (uses slightly different terms) The Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors (H√¢kimler ve Savcƒ±lar Y√ºksek Kurulu) deals with the admission of judges and public prosecutors of courts of justice and administrative courts into the profession, appointments, transfers to other posts, the delegation of temporary powers, promotion to the first category, the allocation of posts; decisions concerning those whose continuation in the profession is found to be unsuitable; the imposition of disciplinary penalties and removal from office. After the Constitutional amendment which took place 2010, the composition of The High Council of Judges and Prosecutors was completely changed. It currently consists of 22 members. Ten members out of 22 are elected among the judges and prosecutors by their colleagues working in first instance courts. While five members are supreme judges elected by other supreme judges, four members of High Council are appointed among lawyers and law professors by the President of Republic and one comes from Judicial Academy. Minister of Justice is the president of High Council and The Undersecretary of the Justice Minister is also an ex-officio member. In the existing system, the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors has its own Secretariat. In addition, the Inspection Board operates under the authority of High Council. =Prosecutors= Public charges are brought by prosecutors (savcƒ±). Their full title is Prosecutor of the Republic (Cumhuriyet savcƒ±sƒ±) and they have a chief office of prosecution (Cumhuriyet Ba≈üsavcƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ±). Prosecutors are also divided into branches regarding their area in laws, similar to that of the judges. The Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors deals with administrative matters concerning judges of the Administrative and Judicial Courts and Public Prosecutors who are not members of the Court of Cassation or the Council of State.Political Structure of TURKEY , OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER, DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF PRESS AND INFORMATION In the Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Turkey in 2006 (released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor in the US State Department on March 6, 2007) it was stated: Courts The judicial system is composed of general law courts; specialized heavy penal courts; the Constitutional Court, the nation's highest court; and three other high courts. The Court of Cassation hears appeals for criminal cases, the council of state hears appeals of administrative cases or cases between government entities, and the audit court audits state institutions. Most cases were prosecuted in the general law courts, which include civil, administrative, and criminal courts. In 2004 parliament adopted legislation providing for the establishment of regional appeals courts to relieve the high court's caseload and allow the judiciary to operate more efficiently. =Supreme courts= The Constitution mentions the following 4 organizations as higher courts in the country: * Constitutional Court (Anayasa Mahkemesi), for constitutional adjudication and review of individual applications concerning human rights violations * Court of Cassation (Yargƒ±tay), the final decision maker in ordinary judiciary * Council of State (Danƒ±≈ütay), the final decision maker in administrative judiciary * Court of Jurisdictional Disputes (Uyu≈ümazlƒ±k Mahkemesi), for resolving the disputes between these courts for constitutional jurisdiction The Constitutional Court The basic function of the Constitutional Court (Anayasa Mahkemesi), established in the 1961 Constitution, is to examine the constitutionality, in both form and substance, of laws, and decrees with the power of law and the Rules of Procedure of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (GNAT). Other functions of the Court are as follows: * With the capacity of the High Tribunal, the Constitutional Court judges the following: the President, members of the Council of Ministers, members of supreme courts, the chairman and members of the Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors and of the Supreme Council of Public Accounts, the Chief Republic Prosecutors and the Deputy Republic Chief Prosecutors for crimes related to their offices. * It audits the finances of political parties. * It examines GNAT decisions to revoke the immunities of deputies, or to dismiss members of parliament. * It chooses the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes. The Constitutional Court is composed of 11 regular and four substitute members. Decisions are made when the eleven members convene. The decisions of the Constitutional Court are final. These decisions cannot be amended in any manner and their application cannot be delayed. Currently, the head of the Turkish Constitutional Court is Mr. Z√ºht√º Arslan, who holds the title President of the Constitutional Court (Anayasa Mahkemesi Ba≈ükanƒ±). The Court of Cassation The Court of Cassation (Yargƒ±tay) is the last instance for reviewing rulings and judgments rendered by justice courts, criminal courts, the examination courts and renders verdicts upon appeal. The opinions rendered by the Court of Cassation are taken as precedents for legal rulings in the first instance courts throughout the country, so that uniform application may be achieved. It is also able to modify its own ruling upon request. The Court of Cassation is divided into civil law and penal law chambers (hukuk ve ceza daireleri).Though Yargitay currently 20 civil and 20 criminal chambers, after the amendment of Yargitay Act in 2016 by the Parliament, the number of chambers will be decreased to 12 civil and 12 criminal chambers and total number of member of Court will be decreased to 210 till the end of 2018.Compare the Turkish website of the Court of Cassation The highest judge, who holds the title First President (Birinci Ba≈ükan), is currently ƒ∞smail R√º≈üt√º Cirit. The Court of Cassation also has a Chief Public Prosecutor (Yargitay Cumhuriyet Ba≈üsavcƒ±sƒ±), who is currently Mehmet Akarca. In case of indictments against political parties, the Chief Public Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation appears before the Constitutional Court. The Council of State The Turkish Council of State (Danƒ±≈ütay) is the highest administrative court in Turkey. It is equivalent to a federal supreme administrative court such as the Conseil d'Etat in France or the Federal Administrative Court of Germany (Bundesverwaltungsgericht). The Court of Jurisdictional Disputes The Court of Jurisdictional Disputes (Uyu≈ümazlƒ±k Mahkemesi) is the final authority to settle disputes concerning verdicts and the competences of the Justice, Administrative or Military Courts. This court is made up of members from the Court of Cassation's General Assembly and the Council of State's General Assembly. = Judicial courts =  Civil courts  Civil courts look at cases related to subjects like ownership, contract violation, divorce and inheritance. There are two forms of civil courts: the Peace Courts and the Civil Courts of First Instance. The Peace Courts (Sulh Mahkemeleri) are the lowest civil courts in Turkey with a single judge. There is at least one in every district. Its jurisdiction covers all cases assigned to the court by the Code of Civil Procedure and other laws. The second form is the Civil Courts of First Instance (Asliye Hukuk Mahkemeleri), which are the basic courts. Their jurisdiction covers all civil cases other than those assigned to the peace courts. There is one in every city and district, and sometimes divided into several branches according to the need and necessity. Within the scope of Civil Courts of First Instance, there are specialized courts for certain legal areas: * Cadastral courts * Commercial courts * Consumer courts * Enforcement courts * Family courts * Intellectual and industrial property courts * Labour courts  Criminal courts  Criminal courts look at cases related to subjects like assault, robbery, murder, arson and rape. Even though the penalties are no longer divided into light and heavy sentences, the criminal courts still are named according to the penalties they were entitled to pass. Penal courts of first instance (or simply penal courts, asliye ceza) are courts with a single judge deciding on minor cases. There is one in every city and in every district, sometimes divided into several branches according to the need and population. The heavy penal courts (Interpol terms them Central Criminal Courts) consist of a presiding judge and two members with a public prosecutor. Offenses and crimes involving a penalty of over five years of imprisonment are under the jurisdiction of these courts of which there is one in every city, but it is sometimes divided into several branches according to the need and population. = Administrative courts = Administrative courts (idari mahkemeler) exist at provincial level. The next instance are regional administrative courts (b√∂lge idari mahkemeleri). Administrative courts solved cases involving probate, bankruptcy, and citizenship matters. Tax and family law were handled in separate courts. The highest administrative court in Turkey is the Turkish Council of State (Danƒ±≈ütay also called Supreme Administrative Court) or, equivalent to a federal supreme administrative court such as the Conseil d'Etat in France or the Federal Administrative Court of Germany (Bundesverwaltungsgericht). =Others=  Court of Accounts  The Court of Accounts (Sayƒ±≈ütay) is Turkey's supreme audit institution charged with auditing, on behalf of the Parliament, all accounts related to the revenues, expenditures and property of government departments financed by general and subsidiary budgets. No applications for judicial review of its decisions shall be filed in administrative courts. There's a debate on whether Sayƒ±≈ütay is a supreme court, or even a court in the strictest sense.\\"Sayƒ±≈ütay tartƒ±≈ümasƒ± \\" (2001-03-07) Yeni Safak The Turkish constitution is said to contradict with itself by not listing Sayƒ±≈ütay amongst supreme courts in articles 146-159 while allowing no appeals to most of its decisions, effectively giving it supreme court power.T√ºrk Hukuk Sistemi  Alternative dispute resolution (ADR)  In certain disputes, the parties are not permitted by law to apply to court before exhausting alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes, whereas in some other disputes, the parties can voluntarily apply to have their dispute settled through ADR. For instance, it is required to undergo mediation in disputes between an employee and an employer regarding employee receivables and reemployment claims before filing a lawsuit in the matter. Likewise, it is mandatory to undergo a mediation process in relation to commercial disputes before initiating litigation proceedings before the relevant court. Some other quasi-legal authorities that must be used before applying to court are as follows: * Arbitration Committee for Consumer Problems. * Sports Arbitration Committee. * Turkish Football Federation Arbitration Committee. Former courts =Civilian justice= Independence Tribunal An Independence Tribunal (ƒ∞stikl√¢l Mahkemesi) was a court invested with superior authority and the first were established in 1920 during the Turkish War of Independence in order to prosecute those who were against the system of the government. Eight such courts were established. They were located in Ankara, Eski≈üehir, Konya, Isparta, Sivas, Kastamonu, Pozantƒ±, and Diyarbakƒ±r. The last one was abolished in 1927. State Security Courts Under the 1982 Constitution the then military government established State Security Courts (Devlet G√ºvenlik Mahkemeleri, DGM) to try cases involving crimes against the security of the state, and organized crime. It would also act as a domestic tribunal to try cases involving genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The DGMs began to operate from May 1984 and replaced military courts which had been in operation during the martial law period. They existed only in eight (of then 67 and now 81) provinces. In April 1991 the Law to Fight Terrorism (Law 3713) entered into force and cases involving crimes against the security of the state were now punishable under this law. The panel of three judges in each DGM included a military judge. As armed forces officers, such military judges remained dependent on the military for salary and pension, subject to military discipline and therefore not independent of military control. In a number of cases the European Court of Human Rights has found the presence of military judges in the State Security Courts to be a violation of the fair trial principles set out in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR). In June 1999 the then Turkish government removed the military judge from the bench. In the context of a package of reforms to the Constitution passed in June 2004, the DGMs were formally abolished. The DGMs were transformed into Heavy Penal Courts, authorized to try only cases involving organized crime and terrorism. In cases of state security, genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes, the military discipline courts would take over. Since the entering into law of a new Criminal Procedure Code on 1 June 2005, the official name for these courts has been \\"Heavy Penal Courts (competent to examine crimes under article 250 of the Criminal Procedure Code)\\". Most of the cases heard in these courts concern cases of political prisoners.Justice Delayed and Denied , Amnesty International, September 2006.Also see a private source with an article on the background to the legal system =Military justice= Abolished in 2017, the militairy related cases were picked up by the Heavy Penal Courts and the Criminal Courts of first instance. The military court system exercised jurisdiction over military personnel and during periods of martial law. The duties are described in Article 11 of Law 1402 on Martial Law of May 1971. Further details are laid out in Articles 11 to 14 of Law 353 on the Foundation and Criminal Procedures at Military Courts of October 1963 (revised in October 2006). The military court system consists of * military courts, * a supreme military administrative court, and * the military court of cassation. Military courts Military Courts had jurisdiction to try military personnel for military offenses, for offenses committed by them against other military personnel or crimes committed in military places, or for offenses connected with military service and duties. Under martial law military courts were competent to try all offences that led to the announcement of martial law. Article 14 of Law 353 described the offences to be tried at military courts in time of war.Also see a critical article on military justice in Turkish According to Article 2 of Law 353 the courts consisted of two military judges (askeri h√¢kim) and an officer. In cases involving more than 200 defendants the bench had four judges and one officer. Military prosecutors (askeri savcƒ±) would be appointed according to the need.The complete text of Law 353 Judges and prosecutors held the title judge (h√¢kim or yargƒ±√ß) along with their ordinary officer's ranks whether they are on the bench or prosecutors. In military courts, there rarely were defense lawyers to the accused, although the defendants were entitled to legal counsel from military personnel with the title askeri h√¢kim. Military Court of Cassation The Military Court of Cassation (Askeri Yargƒ±tay) was the court of final instance for all rulings and verdicts rendered by military courts. It was also a court of first and final instance with jurisdiction over certain military personnel, stipulated by law, with responsibility for any specific trials of these persons. It had a President, usually a brigadier general and a Chief Prosecutor usually a colonel. Military High Court of Administration The Military High Court of Administration or the Supreme Military Administrative Court (Askeri Y√ºksek ƒ∞dare Mahkemesi) had jurisdiction over military personnel in administrative cases or active military service. Its organization was similar to that of the Military Court of Cassation. Note that military courts and civilian courts did not act as subordinates to each other. They were independent from each other and should be immune to political influence. Also note that military courts are exceptional and were only available in military restricted areas.

One is a superhero, the others are supervillains. Publication history Godiva first appeared in Super Friends #7 and was created by E. Nelson Bridwell. Fictional character biography Dorcas Leigh is a beautiful socialite from the United Kingdom with the power to control her hair's movement. Her first mission was to assist the Elongated Man in dismantling a bomb near London. Later on, she helped Wonder Woman find the Queen Bee. She later helps Jack O'Lantern in the Crisis on Infinite Earths and assists Superman in a confrontation with Toyman. Around this time she is part of a team of Guardians protecting Paris, France from an attacking force of Apellaxians. A nearby reporter states it is one of the largest alien groups spotted so far in the invasion. Much later, along with other Global Guardians, she was brainwashed by the Bialyan dictactor Queen Bee, who fools the team into thinking she was going to sponsor them as heroes. While brainwashed, she and her team help the Justice League Europe battle a giant alien robot. This, unknown to the heroes, was part of a plan to increase the Guardian's standing in the eyes of the public. The robot manages to tangle up Godiva's hair with an extending arm. Metamorpho shape-shifts into scissors and cuts the arm. Godiva stresses her hair is her life and to not approach her with scissors again. Later, she and the Olympian, a future romantic interest, use her hair to help stop the now-damaged robot from falling on nearby people, who were too enthralled with the Guardians to notice the battle. Sumaan Harvajarti, the brother of the man Queen Bee deposed, makes a move to take control of Bialya. Several fired members of the League had infiltrated the country and were confronting the Guardians. An accident has slain Little Mermaid, which the League is blamed for. Other League members arrive to quell an international incident. Sumaan destroys the Queen's brainwashing facilities, killing many innocent citizens. Ice manages to save most of the Guardians, the League and some innocent civilians. The brainwashed members regain their right minds. Jack O'Lantern seemingly dies but he was an unknown impostor to the group. The form of Doctor Mist was ravaged but he was a robot duplicate. Godiva herself suffers lacerations but is mobile right after the blast. The Queen herself is shot to death by Sumaan, who takes control of the country. After the events of Bialya, the Guardians drift apart. Fain Y'onia attacks her and the Olympian in London, England. This particular battle ends in his retreat, but not before he wounds her, apparently with the end cause of the loss of her powers because an explosion burnt her hair right off and knocked her out. The struggle against and defeat of Fain takes the lives of Godiva's friends Bushmaster and Thunderlord, with Wild Huntsman missing in action, while putting the seer Tuatara from New Zealand into a coma.\\"Justice League Quarterly\\" #17 (Winter 1994) Post-Infinite Crisis it was revealed (in JSA Classified #19-20, Jan-Feb. 2007) that even after the events with Fain Y'onia, Godiva still had her \\"super hair\\". It was also revealed that she had become a victim of metahuman organ stealing. Her hair had been surgically removed from her scalp leaving her bald, powerless, and under the care of Doctor Klyburn and her medical staff at S.T.A.R. Laboratories. The hair had been removed under the directive of a mentally disturbed Delores Winters at her exclusive spa/clinic, and had been transplanted into the scalp of a young female pop star wanting to be something \\"special\\". In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Godiva's alter-ego has been adjusted to Dora Leigh. Godiva is one of the members of the relaunched Justice League International, with her hair apparently restored in the wake of Flashpoint. She is appointed to the team by UN director Andre Briggs, who uses her to win the favor of a high-ranking British politician. Upon joining the League, Godiva begins to flirt with Booster Gold.Justice League International (vol. 3) #1 Powers and abilities * Godiva has prehensile hair. * Her hair can also perform small, delicate actions, such as picking a lock * Godiva doesn't use her hair to lift things, but the psionic field in her altered hair-cells, causing mutual attraction in across the gaps between strands, allowing her to lift at least 2 tons of steel Other characters named Godiva =Teen Titans villain= Godiva is a foe of the Titans who first appeared in The New Teen Titans vol. 2 Annual #3 (1988).

Her base of operations is in the Swiss Alps. The New Teen Titans first encountered Godiva in France after she had kidnapped John and Cherie Chase, Danny Chase's parents. The Chases had information on a spy satellite that Godiva was planning to steal and sell to the highest bidder. Danny eventually saved the Titans, but Godiva escaped. As a result of Danny's actions and his powers, he was allowed to stay with the Titans. Godiva clashed with the Titans a second time, assassinating a British spy who was taking refuge at a secret agent retirement home. Godiva got away yet again by distracting the Titans with an explosion that appeared to kill Nightwing and by dropping the British agent to his death. =Superman/Batman villain= Another Godiva appeared in Superman/Batman #2 as a member of an alternate universe team of villains called the Axis of Evil.

It represents the spiritual and social organization of the village or community to which it belongs. These are associated with Native American groups including the Caddoan farming villages. The bundle is possessed by an individual, but the power it contains binds the group together. For groups such as the Arikara and the Pawnee, the bundle was a skin envelope with objects inside that could symbolize ideologies and rituals. It is a physical representation of how the people view their world. These objects showed how the keeper of the bundle was descended directly from the original bundle- keeper, all of whom keep the bundles at their homes to be cared for by their wives. In general, the knowledge of the bundle was not common knowledge, but possessed by a priest who would slowly pass this knowledge on to a younger relative, who could carry on the knowledge after his death. The powers represented and contained in the bundle assured the survival of the village and therefore the universe. It controlled all production and social relations, so that if the bundle was lost or destroyed, the people of the village would die. While in ideological terms the bundles may maintain the universe, in literal terms, they were very powerful symbols that helped maintain the chief and ensure the loyalty of his people.

The first Supplex was sent in March 1791 by Ignatie Darabant, the Greek Catholic bishop of Oradea, to the State Council of Vienna. The second Supplex, a largely expanded and argumented version of the first, was brought before the Imperial Court of Vienna on March 30, 1792, by Ioan Bob, Greek Catholic bishop of Blaj, and by Gherasim Adamovici, Orthodox bishop of Transylvania. The demands in the petition, according to the researches of David Prodan, were largely based on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of Revolutionary France, and it also included an essay reviewing historical reasons (such as references to a Roman Dacia-Romanian continuity) as well as statistics about the Romanians (who made up approximately 55% of the population of Transylvania). According to some more recent researches, the argumentation of the Supplex Libellus Valachorum based on the ideas of natural law as well as on the Hungarian feudal judicial argumentation.http://www.hunghist.org/images/volumes/Volume_5_Issue_1/Kov%C3%A1cs.pdf The document was drafted by the most important representatives of the Romanian nation of Transylvania (which were, for the most part, clerics of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church): Samuil Micu, Petru Maior, Gheorghe »òincai, Ioan Piuariu-Molnar, Iosif Mehe»ôi, Ion Budai-Deleanu, Ioan Para etc. The petition was signed in the name of the Romanian nation by its free categories: Clerus, Nobilitas, Civicusque Status Universae Nationis in Transilvania Valachicae. The Supplex was rejected and, as such, the status of the Romanians remained the same. Several such petitions were issued in the following decades, and they all met with the same reaction. Another major petition, the Transylvanian Memorandum, was drafted a century later (in 1892, following the new circumstances after the 1848 Revolution and the Ausgleich), but its authors were sent to prison for treason.

A native of Quebec, he was the second French Canadian and third French American mayor of Los Angeles. Early life Prudent Beaudry was born into a wealthy French Canadian family. After studying in Montreal, he went to New York City to pursue graduate studies in business school. In the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837 that shook the province of Quebec, he traveled in the United States and promoted the idea of annexing Canada to the United States. Around 1840, he settled in New Orleans, where he gained additional experience in commercial activities. In 1842, he returned to Montreal and created an import-export business with his brothers. Because he was responsible for buying stock, Prudent Beaudry frequently needed to travel to Europe. His younger brother Victor left for San Francisco at the height of the California Gold Rush, and convinced Prudent to join him so that they might take advantage of the burgeoning business opportunities to be found there. After selling his shares in the Montreal business to his older brothers, Prudent Beaudry moved to San Francisco and invested all $26,000 of his share money in various enterprises targeting the needs of the Gold Rush miners. Los Angeles Two fires and insufficient insurance left the retail enterprise with only $1,000 left of its stock. In 1853 Prudent moved alone to Los Angeles, and succeeded in regaining a respectable amount of floating capital. In 1854 Prudent decided to invest in capital assets in addition to his retail store. He bought different tracts of land, which constituted the \\"Beaudry Blocks\\". The rents he earned from his real estate assets yielded him $1,000 per month. After Victor rejoined him in 1855, Prudent Beaudry left for Europe in order to consult a Parisian ophthalmologist for eyesight problems. He rested in Montreal for five years, limiting his activity. In 1861, Victor received a lucrative offer to furnish the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War. This offer obliged Prudent to return to Los Angeles and take charge again of his business. His profits by that time amounted to a few thousand dollars per year, a considerable amount for the time. Beaudry acquired the Slate Range Gold and Silver Mining Company at a bargain price when the failed Mojave Desert firm found itself unable to pay for goods purchased from Beaudry's store, though his investment failed when the mining enterprise was destroyed by fire set by disgruntled Californian Indian tribe member workers.An Illustrated History of Los Angeles County, California, Lewis Publishing Co., Chicago, 1889 Beaudry then decided to use his savings to buy inexpensive, undeveloped parcels of land on Bunker Hill above central Los Angeles which featured views of the city at its base and the Pacific Ocean, and an undeveloped hilltop he named Angelino Heights. At both locations, Beaudry developed prestigious, upscale residential districts.Legacy: How French Canadians Shaped North America, McClelland & Stewart, Toronto, 2016 He also bought property near the Sierra Nevada, and built an aqueduct to redirect several mountain streams to his properties. He owned a great deal of real estate in Downtown Los Angeles, located for the most part around Temple Street, Bunker Hill, Bellevue Road, and in the Angelino Heights and Arcadia areas. Beaudry also became interested in architecture and urbanization, and so decided to get involved in city planning. Notably, he planted many new trees and made plans for mansions and modest houses. The quality of his work was rapidly recognized, and the upgraded lands were sold at a very high profit. Most of his free time was dedicated to architecture. Beaudry was elected to three one-year terms in the Los Angeles Common Council, the governing body of the city‚Äîin 1871, 1872 and 1873.[Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials,1850-1938, compiled under direction of Municipal Reference Library, City Hall, Los Angeles (March 1938, reprinted 1966). \\"Prepared ... as a report on Project No. SA 3123-5703-6077-8121-9900 conducted under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.\\" In 1873 he became the first president of the Board of Trade of Los Angeles. In 1874 he became mayor of Los Angeles. Coincidentally during this time, his brother Jean-Louis Beaudry was mayor of Montreal. Later in his life, Beaudry decided to get involved in exporting water; however, the collapse of the Temple and Workman Bank in 1876 hit him very hard and ended the project. Beaudry also invested in the Second Street Cable Railway \\"cable cars\\" for people traveling up and down the hills of central Los Angeles. He died in 1893 in Los Angeles, but was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. The L.A. Times praised him as one of the most visionary men in Los Angeles. Following his will, his body was brought back and buried in Montreal. Los Angeles County praised Beaudry in these words: :: > Prudent Beaudry has the record of having made in different lines five large > fortunes, four of which, through the act of God, or by the duplicity of man, > in whom he had trusted, have been lost; but even then he was not > discouraged, but faced the world, even at an advanced age, like a lion at > bay, and his reward he now enjoys in the shape of a large and assured > fortune. Of such stuff are the men who fill great places, and who develop > and make a country. To such men we of this later day owe much of the beauty > and comfort that surround us, and to such we should look with admiration as > models upon which to form rules of action in trying times. Legacy Beaudry Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles is named for him. The street is on the far west side of his 1874 Bellevue Terrace Tract property, west of Olive Street and north of Sixth Street. The Los Angeles State Normal School, a teachers college and predecessor to UCLA, was built on the tract, where the present-day Los Angeles Central Library is located.Downtown L.A.

It is located on a peninsula near the northernmost point of Amelia Island in Nassau County, Florida. The fort lies to the northeast of Fernandina Beach at the entrance to the Cumberland Sound, in the northeast part of the state. Today it is included within the boundaries of Fort Clinch State Park. History Fort Clinch This site was first fortified in 1736 by the Spanish, when they held colonies in Florida. From 1736, various nations to control the territory have garrisoned and fortified this site to protect the entrance to the St. Marys River and Cumberland Sound. After the end of the Second Seminole War, the United States started construction of a fort, later named Fort Clinch, in 1847. It was part of its Third System of coastal defenses conceived earlier in the century, which guided fortifications throughout this period. The fortified compound is pentagonal in shape, with both inner and outer walls, and consists of almost five million bricks. There are corner bastions and embrasures in the outer walls and several structures in the interior courtyards, including a two-story barracks. The fort was named in honor of General Duncan Lamont Clinch after his death in 1849. General Clinch fought in the War of 1812 and was an important figure in the First and Second Seminole Wars. Confederate forces seized the fort in early 1861. It was used as a safe haven for Confederate blockade runners during the first year of the Civil War. However, changes in technology, specifically, the development of rifled cannon, had improved weaponry to the point that the fort's brick walls were vulnerable to attacks and thus obsolete. In March 1862 General Robert E. Lee ordered abandonment of the fort in order to use scarce troops in other areas. Federal troops re-occupied the fort in early 1862, taking control of the adjacent Georgia and Florida coasts. They used the fort as the base of Union operations in the area throughout the Civil War. The fort was placed on caretaker status in 1869; it remained so until 1898, when the Army garrisoned it during the short Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In September of that year, the Army abandoned it again. The fort gradually deteriorated.\\"Fort Clinch State Park-Something for Everyone\\", Amelia Now Magazine website During the Great Depression, workers of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) began restoration of the fort during the 1930s. It was restored to the Civil War era.National Park Service website: Florida Historic Places-Fort Clinch In 1935, the State of Florida bought that included the then-abandoned fort and the surrounding area. Fort Clinch State Park including the fort, opened to the public in 1938. The fort was closed to the public during World War II and used as a communications and security post. It was re-opened to public visits after the war ended. The fort was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is interpreted largely in terms of its use as a base of Union operations during the American Civil War. State Park personnel reenact military life at the fort, which is open from 8:00am until sundown, year-round.

Best injured his shoulder in 1992, however, and the ride was turned over to Leslie Burr Howard (then Leslie Burr Lenehan). =With Leslie Howard= Howard continued the gelding's career, winning both another AGA Horse of the Year title and the AGA Championship in 1993. The team qualified for the 1994 World Equestrian Games, but an infection occurring at the games disqualified Gem Twist from the championship round and put him out of competition for almost a year. =With Laura Chapot= In 1995, after a lengthy recuperation period, Gem Twist came back into the show ring with Laura Chapot. Although Chapot was still a \\"Young Rider\\" (21 and under), her first year with Gem Twist was very successful. She won the World Cup class at the $100,000 Autumn Classic, earning her the Budweiser Rookie of the Year award, and she rode the horse to his third win at the Budweiser AGA Championships. Her second season continued to be successful, with wins at three World Cup qualifying classes, including Tampa's Volvo Grand Prix of Florida--whose starting field of more than eighty horses made it the largest grand prix jumper class of all time. She finished Gem's career with a win at the World Cup USA East League Championship (which was held at the same venue at which he won his first Grand Prix with Best nine years earlier). Chapot formally retired Gem Twist at the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden on November 1, 1997. During his career, Gem Twist accumulated more than $800,000 in prize money. In 2002, Gem Twist was inducted into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame.\\"Gem Twist\\". American Show Jumping Hall of Fame. Referenced January 2, 2008.

Allen after Erie Canal barge traffic was converted from mule power to engine power, raising the speed of traffic. Also known as \\"Fifteen Years on the Erie Canal\\", \\"Fifteen Miles on the Erie Canal\\", \\"Erie Canal Song\\", \\"Erie Barge Canal\\", and \\"Mule Named Sal\\", the song memorializes the years from 1825 to 1880 when the mule barges made boomtowns out of Utica, Rome, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo, and transformed New York into the Empire State. The music cover published in 1913 depicts a boy on a mule getting down to pass under a bridge, but the song refers to travelers who would typically ride on top of the boats. The low bridges would require them to get down out of the way to allow safe passage under a bridge.http://www.eriecanalsong.com/ Recordings Early 20th century recordings of the song include ones by Billy Murray, Vernon Dalhart, and Jack Narz. The song has become part of the folk repertoire, recorded by folksingers like Glenn Yarborough, Pete Seeger and the Weavers, The Kingston Trio, the children's series VeggieTales, and artists like the Sons of the Pioneers. Dan Zanes included it on a children's album with Suzanne Vega singing lead. Bruce Springsteen recorded the song on his 2006 album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions. The cartoon series Animaniacs parodied \\"Low Bridge\\" with their song about the Panama Canal. The lyrics are also the text of the book The Erie Canal (1970), illustrated by Peter Spier. Traditional lyrics Variations As with most folk songs, the lyrics have changed over time. The most obvious changes from Thomas Allen's original version has been changing the word \\"years\\" to \\"miles\\". Allen's original version commemorates 15 years of working along the canal with Sal. The new version using the word miles refers to the average distance a mule would tow a barge before resting or being relieved by another mule. Dave Ruch's research on this change has been documented in an extensive article. Another change is in the second verse. The current line \\"Git up there mule, here comes a lock\\" is a change from the original line \\"Get up there gal, we've passed that lock\\". The original refers to how mules would rest while waiting for barges to lock through, and then need to be instructed when to start again. The current implies speeding up when a lock is within sight ‚Äî not a standard course of action. =Alternate lyrics= References External links * Library of Congress National Jukebox: Low bridge!

She made her debut in 1933. Her cartoons were musical spoofs of melodrama serials like The Perils of Pauline, in which blonde sweetheart Fanny -- \\"the Banker's Daughter\\" -- was pursued by the villainous Oil Can Harry, and protected by the heroic J. Leffingwell Strongheart. Terrytoons later used the melodrama spoof as a running theme in the Mighty Mouse cartoons, beginning with A Fight to the Finish in 1947. The endangered heroine was renamed Pearl Purehart in Mighty Mouse, and Oil Can Harry became Mighty Mouse's cat archvillain. Fanny Zilch also inspired a series of Betty Boop melodrama spoofs, beginning in 1934 with She Wronged Him Right. Development Fanny's character design originated in the 1933 cartoon King Zilch, as a dancing girl who made romantic gestures toward the King. Her first starring role was in 1933's The Banker's Daughter, which begins with an opening crawl: \\"EPISODE I: Fanny Zilch, the banker's daughter, has been captured by the bootleggers (the dirty skunks). She has had nothing to eat but fried chicken for a week... poor Gal. \\"Oil Can Harry\\" her third husband by a former marriage is the fly in the beer can. Will her lover arrive in time?\\" The cartoon opens with Fanny tied up in a sawmill by the sneering, silk-hatted villain. Oil Can Harry telegraphs her father with a ransom note, but her somewhat effeminate lover Strongheart rides a white horse to her rescue. When Fanny refuses to go along with Harry's plans, he sends her down a chute towards a spinning saw. Strongheart arrives and beats up the villain, saving Fanny from her dreadful fate. In Episode II, The Oil Can Mystery, Fanny is once again in Oil Can Harry's power, with Strongheart tied to a railroad track. Episode III, Fanny in the Lion's Den, has Harry lock Fanny up in a dungeon filled with lions, but over the course of several months, she befriends the lions, and they try to help her escape. In Episode IV, Hypnotic Eyes, Harry has gained power over Fanny through hypnosis. In the final episode of the 1933 series, Fanny's Wedding Day, Harry tries to interrupt Fanny and Strongheart's wedding day. The characters were brought back in 1935 for a simpler, cheaper followup, Foiled Again. In this cartoon, Strongheart leads a gang in pursuit of Harry, who's got Fanny in yet another sawmill. This cartoon has less music and dialogue than the previous series; Harry is the only character with dialogue. In 1937, the series was revived again as \\"Oil Can Harry\\" in The Villain Still Pursued Her with new character designs, including a dark-haired Fanny. The characters were brought back for one more cartoon in 1937's The Saw Mill Mystery. Reception and legacy The 1933 episodes were deemed a success, with Film Daily writing a glowing review of The Banker's Daughter: \\"The opera idea combined with the burlesque meller makes this a real laugh number that will appeal to grown-ups with its cleverness and be received with delight by the kids. It is the first of a series of four. If the new technique catches on, it is liable to create a new slant in the animated field.\\" Happy with the results, Paul Terry went on to create a variety of musical and operetta cartoons over the next couple years, including Jealous Lover, Robin Hood, Gypsy Fiddler, The Pirate Ship in 1933, and A Mad House and Holland Days in 1934.

The exact number of plays‚Äîas well as their classifications as tragedy, history, or comedy‚Äîis a matter of scholarly debate. Shakespeare's plays are widely regarded as being among the greatest in the English language and are continually performed around the world. The plays have been translated into every major living language. Many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos, but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623, when the posthumous First Folio was published. The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories follows the categories used in the First Folio. However, modern criticism has labeled some of these plays \\"problem plays\\" that elude easy categorisation, or perhaps purposely break generic conventions, and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies. When Shakespeare first arrived in London in the late 1570s or early 1580s, dramatists writing for London's new commercial playhouses (such as The Curtain) were combining two strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively Elizabethan synthesis. Previously, the most common forms of popular English theatre were the Tudor morality plays. These plays, generally celebrating piety, use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over Evil. The characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic. As a child, Shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play (along with, perhaps, mystery plays and miracle plays). The other strand of dramatic tradition was classical aesthetic theory. This theory was derived ultimately from Aristotle; in Renaissance England, however, the theory was better known through its Roman interpreters and practitioners. At the universities, plays were staged in a more academic form as Roman closet dramas. These plays, usually performed in Latin, adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum, but they were also more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. Shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school, where Plautus and especially Terence were key parts of the curriculumBaldwin, T.W. (1944). Shakspere's Small Latine and Less Greek. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 499‚Äì532). and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.Doran, Madeleine (1954). Endeavors of Art. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 160‚Äì71 Theatre and stage setup Archaeological excavations on the foundations of the Rose and the Globe in the late twentieth centuryGurr, pp. 123‚Äì31, 142‚Äì46. showed that all London English Renaissance theatres were built around similar general plans. Despite individual differences, the public theatres were three stories high and built around an open space at the center. Usually polygonal in plan to give an overall rounded effect, three levels of inward-facing galleries overlooked the open center into which jutted the stage‚Äîessentially a platform surrounded on three sides by the audience, only the rear being restricted for the entrances and exits of the actors and seating for the musicians. The upper level behind the stage could be used as a balcony, as in Romeo and Juliet, or as a position for a character to harangue a crowd, as in Julius Caesar. Usually built of timber, lath and plaster and with thatched roofs, the early theatres were vulnerable to fire, and gradually were replaced (when necessary) with stronger structures. When the Globe burned down in June 1613, it was rebuilt with a tile roof. A different model was developed with the Blackfriars Theatre, which came into regular use on a long term basis in 1599. The Blackfriars was small in comparison to the earlier theatres, and roofed rather than open to the sky; it resembled a modern theatre in ways that its predecessors did not. Elizabethan Shakespeare For Shakespeare, as he began to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, filtered through the recent success of the University Wits on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionized theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form.Bevington, David (1969). From Mankind to Marlowe (Cambridge: Harvard University Press), passim. The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies,Logan, Robert A. (2006). Shakespeare's Marlowe Ashgate Publishing, p. 156. creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements of what it means to be human. What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, John Lyly and George Peele, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career. Shakespeare's Elizabethan tragedies (including the history plays with tragic designs, such as Richard II) demonstrate his relative independence from classical models. He takes from Aristotle and Horace the notion of decorum; with few exceptions, he focuses on high-born characters and national affairs as the subject of tragedy. In most other respects, though, the early tragedies are far closer to the spirit and style of moralities. They are episodic, packed with character and incident; they are loosely unified by a theme or character.Ribner, Irving (1957). The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 12‚Äì27. In this respect, they reflect clearly the influence of Marlowe, particularly of Tamburlaine. Even in his early work, however, Shakespeare generally shows more restraint than Marlowe; he resorts to grandiloquent rhetoric less frequently, and his attitude towards his heroes is more nuanced, and sometimes more sceptical, than Marlowe's.Waith, Eugene (1967). The Herculean Hero in Marlowe, Chapman, Shakespeare, and Dryden. New York: Columbia University Press. By the turn of the century, the bombast of Titus Andronicus had vanished, replaced by the subtlety of Hamlet. In comedy, Shakespeare strayed even further from classical models. The Comedy of Errors, an adaptation of Menaechmi, follows the model of new comedy closely. Shakespeare's other Elizabethan comedies are more romantic. Like Lyly, he often makes romantic intrigue (a secondary feature in Latin new comedy) the main plot element;Doran 220‚Äì25. even this romantic plot is sometimes given less attention than witty dialogue, deceit, and jests. The \\"reform of manners,\\" which Horace considered the main function of comedy,Edward Rand (1937). Horace and the Spirit of Comedy. Houston: Rice Institute Press, passim. survives in such episodes as the gulling of Malvolio. Jacobean Shakespeare Shakespeare reached maturity as a dramatist at the end of Elizabeth's reign, and in the first years of the reign of James. In these years, he responded to a deep shift in popular tastes, both in subject matter and approach. At the turn of the decade, he responded to the vogue for dramatic satire initiated by the boy players at Blackfriars and St. Paul's. At the end of the decade, he seems to have attempted to capitalise on the new fashion for tragicomedy,Kirsch, Arthur. Cymbeline and Coterie Dramaturgy even collaborating with John Fletcher, the writer who had popularised the genre in England. The influence of younger dramatists such as John Marston and Ben Jonson is seen not only in the problem plays, which dramatise intractable human problems of greed and lust, but also in the darker tone of the Jacobean tragedies.Foakes, R.A. (1968). Shakespeare: Dark Comedies to Last Plays. London: Routledge, 18‚Äì40. The Marlovian, heroic mode of the Elizabethan tragedies is gone, replaced by a darker vision of heroic natures caught in environments of pervasive corruption. As a sharer in both the Globe and in the King's Men, Shakespeare never wrote for the boys' companies; however, his early Jacobean work is markedly influenced by the techniques of the new, satiric dramatists. One play, Troilus and Cressida, may even have been inspired by the War of the Theatres.Campbell, O.J. (1938). Comicall Satyre and Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida. San Marino: Huntington Library. passim. Shakespeare's final plays hark back to his Elizabethan comedies in their use of romantic situation and incident.David Young (1972). The Heart's Forest: A Study of Shakespeare's Pastoral Plays. New Haven: Yale University Press, 130ff. In these plays, however, the sombre elements that are largely glossed over in the earlier plays are brought to the fore and often rendered dramatically vivid. This change is related to the success of tragicomedies such as Philaster, although the uncertainty of dates makes the nature and direction of the influence unclear. From the evidence of the title-page to The Two Noble Kinsmen and from textual analysis it is believed by some editors that Shakespeare ended his career in collaboration with Fletcher, who succeeded him as house playwright for the King's Men. These last plays resemble Fletcher's tragicomedies in their attempt to find a comedic mode capable of dramatising more serious events than had his earlier comedies. Style During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, \\"drama became the ideal means to capture and convey the diverse interests of the time.\\" Stories of various genres were enacted for audiences consisting of both the wealthy and educated and the poor and illiterate. Later on, he retired at the height of the Jacobean period, not long before the start of the Thirty Years' War. His verse style, his choice of subjects, and his stagecraft all bear the marks of both periods. His style changed not only in accordance with his own tastes and developing mastery, but also in accord with the tastes of the audiences for whom he wrote.Bentley, G.E. \\"The Profession of Dramatist in Shakespeare's Time,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 115 (1971), 481. While many passages in Shakespeare's plays are written in prose, he almost always wrote a large proportion of his plays and poems in iambic pentameter. In some of his early works (like Romeo and Juliet), he even added punctuation at the end of these iambic pentameter lines to make the rhythm even stronger.Introduction to Hamlet by William Shakespeare, Barron's Educational Series, 2002, p. 11. He and many dramatists of this period used the form of blank verse extensively in character dialogue, thus heightening poetic effects. To end many scenes in his plays he used a rhyming couplet to give a sense of conclusion, or completion. A typical example is provided in Macbeth: as Macbeth leaves the stage to murder Duncan (to the sound of a chiming clock), he says,Macbeth Act 2, Scene 1 Shakespeare's writing (especially his plays) also feature extensive wordplay in which double entendres and rhetorical flourishes are repeatedly used. Humour is a key element in all of Shakespeare's plays. Although a large amount of his comical talent is evident in his comedies, some of the most entertaining scenes and characters are found in tragedies such as Hamlet and histories such as Henry IV, Part 1. Shakespeare's humour was largely influenced by Plautus.\\"Humor in Shakespeare's Plays.\\" Shakespeare's World and Work. Ed. John F. Andrews. 2001. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. =Soliloquies in plays= Shakespeare's plays are also notable for their use of soliloquies, in which a character makes a speech to him- or herself so the audience can understand the character's inner motivations and conflict.Clemen, Wolfgang H. (1987). Shakespeare's Soliloquies. translated by Charity S. Stokes, Routledge, p. 11. In his book Shakespeare and the History of Soliloquies, James Hirsh defines the convention of a Shakespearean soliloquy in early modern drama. He argues that when a person on the stage speaks to himself or herself, they are characters in a fiction speaking in character; this is an occasion of self-address. Furthermore, Hirsh points out that Shakespearean soliloquies and \\"asides\\" are audible in the fiction of the play, bound to be overheard by any other character in the scene unless certain elements confirm that the speech is protected. Therefore, a Renaissance playgoer who was familiar with this dramatic convention would have been alert to Hamlet's expectation that his soliloquy be overheard by the other characters in the scene. Moreover, Hirsh asserts that in soliloquies in other Shakespearean plays, the speaker is entirely in character within the play's fiction. Saying that addressing the audience was outmoded by the time Shakespeare was alive, he \\"acknowledges few occasions when a Shakespearean speech might involve the audience in recognising the simultaneous reality of the stage and the world the stage is representing.\\" Other than 29 speeches delivered by choruses or characters who revert to that condition as epilogues \\"Hirsh recognises only three instances of audience address in Shakespeare's plays, 'all in very early comedies, in which audience address is introduced specifically to ridicule the practice as antiquated and amateurish.'\\" Source material of the plays The first edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande, printed in 1577. As was common in the period, Shakespeare based many of his plays on the work of other playwrights and recycled older stories and historical material. His dependence on earlier sources was a natural consequence of the speed at which playwrights of his era wrote; in addition, plays based on already popular stories appear to have been seen as more likely to draw large crowds. There were also aesthetic reasons: Renaissance aesthetic theory took seriously the dictum that tragic plots should be grounded in history. For example, King Lear is probably an adaptation of an older play, King Leir, and the Henriad probably derived from The Famous Victories of Henry V.William Shakespeare. (n.d.) Retrieved from: https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Shakespeare/Shakespeares-sources There is speculation that Hamlet (c. 1601) may be a reworking of an older, lost play (the so-called Ur-Hamlet),Welsh, Alexander (2001). Hamlet in his Modern Guises. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 3 but the number of lost plays from this time period makes it impossible to determine that relationship with certainty. (The Ur-Hamlet may in fact have been Shakespeare's, and was just an earlier and subsequently discarded version.) For plays on historical subjects, Shakespeare relied heavily on two principal texts. Most of the Roman and Greek plays are based on Plutarch's Parallel Lives (from the 1579 English translation by Sir Thomas North),Plutarch's Parallel Lives. Accessed 23 October 2005. and the English history plays are indebted to Raphael Holinshed's 1587 Chronicles. This structure did not apply to comedy, and those of Shakespeare's plays for which no clear source has been established, such as Love's Labour's Lost and The Tempest, are comedies. Even these plays, however, rely heavily on generic commonplaces. While there is much dispute about the exact chronology of Shakespeare plays, the plays tend to fall into three main stylistic groupings. The first major grouping of his plays begins with his histories and comedies of the 1590s. Shakespeare's earliest plays tended to be adaptations of other playwrights' works and employed blank verse and little variation in rhythm. However, after the plague forced Shakespeare and his company of actors to leave London for periods between 1592 and 1594, Shakespeare began to use rhymed couplets in his plays, along with more dramatic dialogue. These elements showed up in The Taming of the Shrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Almost all of the plays written after the plague hit London are comedies, perhaps reflecting the public's desire at the time for light-hearted fare. Other comedies from Shakespeare during this period include Much Ado About Nothing, The Merry Wives of Windsor and As You Like It. The middle grouping of Shakespeare's plays begins in 1599 with Julius Caesar. For the next few years, Shakespeare would produce his most famous dramas, including Macbeth, Hamlet, and King Lear. The plays during this period are in many ways the darkest of Shakespeare's career and address issues such as betrayal, murder, lust, power and egoism. The final grouping of plays, called Shakespeare's late romances, include Pericles, Prince of Tyre, Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale and The Tempest. The romances are so called because they bear similarities to medieval romance literature. Among the features of these plays are a redemptive plotline with a happy ending, and magic and other fantastic elements.  Canonical plays  Except where noted, the plays below are listed, for the thirty-six plays included in the First Folio of 1623, according to the order in which they appear there, with two plays that were not included (Pericles, Prince of Tyre and The Two Noble Kinsmen) being added at the end of the list of comedies and Edward III at the end of the list of histories. = Comedies = # The Tempest LR # The Two Gentlemen of Verona # The Merry Wives of Windsor # Measure for Measure PP # The Comedy of Errors # Much Ado About Nothing # Love's Labour's Lost # A Midsummer Night's Dream # The Merchant of Venice PP # As You Like It # The Taming of the Shrew # All's Well That Ends Well PP # Twelfth Night # The Winter's Tale LR PP # Pericles, Prince of Tyre LR ~~FF~~ # The Two Noble Kinsmen LR ~~FF~~ =Histories= # King John # Edward III ~~FF~~ # Richard II # Henry IV, Part 1 # Henry IV, Part 2 # Henry V # Henry VI, Part 1 # Henry VI, Part 2 # Henry VI, Part 3 # Richard III # Henry VIII = Tragedies = # Troilus and Cressida PP # Coriolanus # Titus Andronicus # Romeo and Juliet # Timon of Athens PP # Julius Caesar # Macbeth # Hamlet # King Lear # Othello # Antony and Cleopatra # Cymbeline LR Note: Plays marked with LR are now commonly referred to as the \\"late romances\\". Plays marked with PP are sometimes referred to as the \\"problem plays\\". The three plays marked with ~~FF~~ were not included in the First Folio. Dramatic collaborations Like most playwrights of his period, Shakespeare did not always write alone, and a number of his plays were collaborative, although the exact number is open to debate. Some of the following attributions, such as for The Two Noble Kinsmen, have well-attested contemporary documentation; others, such as for Titus Andronicus, remain more controversial and are dependent on linguistic analysis by modern scholars. * Cardenio, either a lost play or one that survives only in later adaptation Double Falsehood; contemporary reports say that Shakespeare collaborated on it with John Fletcher. * Cymbeline, in which the Yale edition suggests that there was a collaborator; some scenes (Act III scene 7 and Act V scene 2) may strike the reader as un-Shakespearean compared with others. * Edward III, of which Brian Vickers' recent analysis concluded that the play was 40% Shakespeare and 60% Thomas Kyd. * Henry VI, Part 1, possibly the work of a team of playwrights, whose identities we can only guess at. Some scholars argue that Shakespeare wrote less than 20% of the text. * Henry VIII, generally considered a collaboration between Shakespeare and Fletcher. * Macbeth, Thomas Middleton may have revised this tragedy in 1615 to incorporate extra musical sequences. * Measure for Measure may have undergone a light revision by Middleton at some point after its original composition. * Pericles, Prince of Tyre may include the work of George Wilkins, either as collaborator, reviser, or revisee. * Timon of Athens may result from collaboration between Shakespeare and Middleton; this might explain its unusual plot and unusually cynical tone. * Titus Andronicus may be a collaboration with, or revision by, George Peele. * The Two Noble Kinsmen, published in quarto in 1634 and attributed to Fletcher and Shakespeare; each playwright appears to have written about half of the text. Lost plays * Love's Labour's Won ‚Äì a late sixteenth-century writer, Francis Meres, and a bookseller's list both include this title among Shakespeare's recent works, but no play of this title has survived. It may have become lost, or it may represent an alternative title of one of the plays listed above, such as Much Ado About Nothing or All's Well That Ends Well. * Cardenio ‚Äì attributed to William Shakespeare and John Fletcher in a Stationers' Register entry of 1653 (alongside a number of erroneous attributions), and often believed to have been re-worked from a subplot in Cervantes' Don Quixote. In 1727, Lewis Theobald produced a play he called Double Falshood, which he claimed to have adapted from three manuscripts of a lost play by Shakespeare that he did not name. Double Falshood does re-work the Cardenio story, but modern scholarship has not established with certainty whether Double Falshood includes fragments of Shakespeare's lost play. Plays possibly by Shakespeare Note: For a comprehensive account of plays possibly by Shakespeare or in part by Shakespeare, see the separate entry on the Shakespeare Apocrypha. * Arden of Faversham ‚Äì the middle portion of the play (scenes 4‚Äì9) may have been written by Shakespeare. * Edmund Ironside ‚Äì contains numerous words first used by Shakespeare. * Sir Thomas More ‚Äì a collaborative work by several playwrights, including Shakespeare. There is a \\"growing scholarly consensus\\" that Shakespeare was called in to re-write a contentious scene in the play and that \\"Hand D\\" in the surviving manuscript is that of Shakespeare himself.Woodhuysen (2010: 70) * The Spanish Tragedy ‚Äì additional passages included in the fourth quarto, including the \\"painter scene\\", are likely to have been written by him.  Shakespeare and the textual problem  Unlike his contemporary Ben Jonson, Shakespeare did not have direct involvement in publishing his plays and produced no overall authoritative version of his plays before he died. As a result, the problem of identifying what Shakespeare actually wrote is a major concern for most modern editions. One of the reasons there are textual problems is that there was no copyright of writings at the time. As a result, Shakespeare and the playing companies he worked with did not distribute scripts of his plays, for fear that the plays would be stolen. This led to bootleg copies of his plays, which were often based on people trying to remember what Shakespeare had actually written. Textual corruptions also stemming from printers' errors, misreadings by compositors, or simply wrongly scanned lines from the source material litter the Quartos and the First Folio. Additionally, in an age before standardised spelling, Shakespeare often wrote a word several times in a different spelling, and this may have contributed to some of the transcribers' confusion. Modern editors have the task of reconstructing Shakespeare's original words and expurgating errors as far as possible. In some cases the textual solution presents few difficulties. In the case of Macbeth for example, scholars believe that someone (probably Thomas Middleton) adapted and shortened the original to produce the extant text published in the First Folio, but that remains our only authorised text. In others the text may have become manifestly corrupt or unreliable (Pericles or Timon of Athens) but no competing version exists. The modern editor can only regularise and correct erroneous readings that have survived into the printed versions. The textual problem can, however, become rather complicated. Modern scholarship now believes Shakespeare to have modified his plays through the years, sometimes leading to two existing versions of one play. To provide a modern text in such cases, editors must face the choice between the original first version and the later, revised, usually more theatrical version. In the past editors have resolved this problem by conflating the texts to provide what they believe to be a superior Ur-text, but critics now argue that to provide a conflated text would run contrary to Shakespeare's intentions. In King Lear for example, two independent versions, each with their own textual integrity, exist in the Quarto and the Folio versions. Shakespeare's changes here extend from the merely local to the structural. Hence the Oxford Shakespeare, published in 1986 (second edition 2005), provides two different versions of the play, each with respectable authority. The problem exists with at least four other Shakespearean plays (Henry IV, part 1, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello). Performance history The modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre, in London. During Shakespeare's lifetime, many of his greatest plays were staged at the Globe Theatre and the Blackfriars Theatre.Editor's Preface to A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare, Simon and Schuster, 2004, p. xlFoakes, 6. ‚Ä¢ Nagler, A.M (1958). Shakespeare's Stage. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 7. . ‚Ä¢ Shapiro, 131‚Äì32. Shakespeare's fellow members of the Lord Chamberlain's Men acted in his plays. Among these actors were Richard Burbage (who played the title role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including Hamlet, Othello, Richard III and King Lear),Ringler, William Jr. (1997). \\"Shakespeare and His Actors: Some Remarks on King Lear\\" from Lear from Study to Stage: Essays in Criticism edited by James Ogden and Arthur Hawley Scouten, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, p. 127. Richard Cowley (who played Verges in Much Ado About Nothing), William Kempe, (who played Peter in Romeo and Juliet and, possibly, Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream) and Henry Condell and John Heminges, who are most famous now for collecting and editing the plays of Shakespeare's First Folio (1623). Shakespeare's plays continued to be staged after his death until the Interregnum (1649‚Äì1660), when all public stage performances were banned by the Puritan rulers. After the English Restoration, Shakespeare's plays were performed in playhouses with elaborate scenery and staged with music, dancing, thunder, lightning, wave machines, and fireworks. During this time the texts were \\"reformed\\" and \\"improved\\" for the stage, an undertaking which has seemed shockingly disrespectful to posterity. Victorian productions of Shakespeare often sought pictorial effects in \\"authentic\\" historical costumes and sets. The staging of the reported sea fights and barge scene in Antony and Cleopatra was one spectacular example.Halpern (1997). Shakespeare Among the Moderns. New York: Cornell University Press, 64. . Too often, the result was a loss of pace. Towards the end of the 19th century, William Poel led a reaction against this heavy style. In a series of \\"Elizabethan\\" productions on a thrust stage, he paid fresh attention to the structure of the drama. In the early twentieth century, Harley Granville- Barker directed quarto and folio texts with few cuts,Griffiths, Trevor R (ed.) (1996). A Midsummer Night's Dream. William Shakespeare. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Introduction, 2, 38‚Äì39. . ‚Ä¢ Halpern, 64. while Edward Gordon Craig and others called for abstract staging.

His most famous appearance was in a six-man match at WrestleMania III for the World Wrestling Federation. Career Lionel Giroux began his wrestling career in 1950, at the age of fifteen, and then began to wrestle for promoters in Quebec. He, along with Sky Low Low, became two of the most famous midget wrestlers in wrestling who had enough drawing power to command a large portion of the live gate for wrestling events. Giroux helped to create the comedy matches that have since become a trademark for midget wrestling in Canada and the United States. In 1973, Giroux won the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Midget Wrestler of the Year award. His last in-ring appearance was at WrestleMania III in the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan in 1987, at the age of 52. Giroux, wrestling as Little Beaver, teamed with Hillbilly Jim and fellow midget wrestler the Haiti Kid, defeating King Kong Bundy and his midget tag-team partners Little Tokyo and Lord Littlebrook, after Bundy was disqualified for attacking Little Beaver. During the match, Giroux suffered a back injury at the hands of Bundy after he was bodyslammed and had an elbow dropped on him by the Bundy, which forced him to retire from professional wrestling (through the match Beaver had \\"annoyed\\" Bundy including elbowing him in the stomach, delivering a drop kick that had literally no effect, and slapping him with his Moccasin which Bundy claimed \\"Stung like a son-of-a-bitch\\"). In a 1998 interview Bundy said he hoped that he wasn't responsible for Giroux's early death, saying he wouldn't want that on his conscience. A few months after Wrestlemania III, during a match at the Boston Garden that aired later on WWF Prime Time Wrestling, Giroux (again as Little Beaver) was in Hillbilly Jim's corner for a match against the One Man Gang. In a comical match eventually won by Hillbilly via a countout, Beaver got involved on several occasions, including antagonizing Gang's manager, Slick, throughout the match and hitting the back of Gang's head with a broom after the match was finished. The Gang finally caught Little Beaver in the ring and after delivering a blow that sent him sprawling, he followed Slick's orders to hit Beaver with his 747 Splash.One Man Gang squashes Little Beaver Death and legacy Giroux died on December 4, 1995 of emphysema.

The Little Beaver Creek watershed is located primarily in Columbiana County in eastern Ohio, and in portions of Carroll County, Mahoning County, and western Pennsylvania, draining approximately 605 mi¬≤ (1,567 km¬≤), of which 503 mi¬≤ (1,303 km¬≤) are in Ohio. The watershed in total size covers an area of approximately 510 square miles, with about 80% of this being situated in Ohio. The great majority of land within the watershed is privately owned. Within the watershed are roughly 808 miles of linear streams. The creek is protected by a number of classifications, including Ohio Wild and Scenic River and National Scenic River, as well as being part of Ohio's state park system. It is the only major river in Ohio to have dual State Wild and Scenic and National Scenic River designations, and was the first in the country to earn both distinctions. The creek empties into the Ohio River just east of East Liverpool, Ohio. The now- defunct Sandy and Beaver Canal was constructed alongside the creek. According to an Ohio Department of Natural Resources study conducted in 2004, Little Beaver Creek is an exceptionally clean waterway with a highly diverse ecosystem. It supports 63 species of fish, 49 mammal species, 270 species of migratory and resident birds and 46 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the rare and protected salamander known as the hellbender. It is thought to be the only riparian corridor in the United States which shows geologic evidence of all five ice ages. Little Beaver Creek has several forks, which lead generally in a southern and easterly direction.

Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131 (1966), was a United States Supreme Court case based on the First Amendment in the U.S. Constitution. It held that protesters have a First and Fourteenth Amendment right to engage in a peaceful sit-in at a public library. Justice Fortas wrote the plurality opinion and was joined by Justice Douglas and Justice Warren. Justices Brennan and Byron White concurred. Justices Black, Clark, Harlan and Stewart dissented. Background In order to protest their denial of their right to equal treatment guaranteed by the Constitution, five African-Americans entered the Audubon Regional Library. Audubon Regional Library is a public library in Clinton, Louisiana. There was no one else in the library room except the library assistant. One of the African-Americans (Brown) requested a book, and upon checking, the library assistant informed Brown that they did not have the book, and that she would request it from the State Library. (The book was later mailed to him with instructions for its return). The library assistant then asked them to leave, but instead for the purpose of maintaining their silent protest against the library's policy of segregation, Brown sat down and the others stood around him. There was no noise or boisterous talking. 10 to 15 minutes after they had entered the library, the sheriff and deputies arrived, and they were arrested. They were charged under the Louisiana breach of the peace statute, which makes it a crime to \\"with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby\\" or to crowd in a public place and refuse to disperse. Justice Fortas and Justice Black each included a summary of the events in their opinions. Justice Fortas' summary for the majority is more concise than Justice Black's in his dissent. Decision Justice Abe Fortas wrote the plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice Warren, and Justice Douglas, with Justices Brennan and White writing concurring opinions. Fortas concluded that there was no evidence to support the use of the breach of the peace statute, and that the protest was considerably less disruptive than earlier situations that the Court had invalidated convictions‚Äîincluding Cox v. Louisiana. Dissent Justice Black, in his dissent, finds nothing preventing Louisiana from banning sit-in demonstrations, and criticises the majority opinion for acting as if Louisiana had intended to deny access to the libraries based upon race. Black also noted that when Brown asked for a book, he was served. Thus showing that he was not denied access or service, and discussed that there was no racial discrimination on the part of the library.

Early life Vedova was born in Venice into a working-class family. His artisan roots came from his house-painting father. He was the third child out of seven. Emilio began working at a young age, primarily in a factory. Later he got a job in a photography and restoration studio. Career He was primarily a self-taught artist aside from a few night classes. After an initial formative experience within Expressionism, he joined the group \\"Corrente\\" (1942‚Äì43), during the second world war, which included other artists such as Renato Guttuso and Renato Birolli. He recorded his experience in his drawings. During this time he also participated in the Italian resistance movement. Vedova returned to Venice towards the end of the war and played a key role in the post-war Italian art movement, which was connecting to the European avant-garde. His work became much more abstract. His images represented the apprehension of the time, with his geometric shapes and color palette. In 1946 he co-signed the manifesto \\"Beyond Guernica\\" which included several Italian artists who were to become famous. In 1947 Vedova founded Fronte Nuovo delle Arti. In 1951, Vedova exhibited his first solo show in the United States at the Catherine Viviano Gallery located in New York. This show was where he began to attract big name collectors, such as Peggy Guggenheim. In 1952 he became a member of the influential and more avant garde Gruppo degli Otto (Afro, Birolli, Corpora, Santomaso, Morlotti, Vedova, Moreni and Turcato), organised by the critic Lionello Venturi, which exhibited at the Venice Biennial. This show is known to have begun the art movement recognized as Arte Informale. His work exerted a significant influence on the Arte Povera group.[s.n.] (20 November 2006). Emilio Vedova (obituary).

Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536 (1965), is a United States Supreme Court case based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It held that a state government cannot employ \\"breach of the peace\\" statutes against protesters engaging in peaceable demonstrations that may potentially incite violence. Background The case arose after the picketing of a segregated restaurant on December 14, 1961, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, led to the arrest of 23 student protesters from Southern University, a black college. The next day, B. Elton Cox, a minister, arranged a protest of 2,000 people at the courthouse where the students were being held. The police agreed to allow the protest as long as it was across the street from the courthouse. Between 100 and 300 whites gathered on the other side of the street. The protesters proceeded in a peaceful orderly fashion, and began to sing songs and hymns causing the jailed students to respond by singing. Cox then gave a speech exhorting the protesters that upon departure from the courthouse, to proceed into downtown to sit at the segregated lunch counters, This caused \\"muttering\\" and \\"grumbling\\" in the gathering white crowd across the street. The sheriff then ordered the protesters to disperse, but before they could, the police fired tear gas into the black group, injuring some, including minister Cox who was hit in the ankle by a tear gas cannister. No arrests were made then, but the next day Reverend Cox was arrested at a church and charged with four offenses under Louisiana law, criminal conspiracy, disturbing the peace, obstructing public passages, and picketing before a courthouse. This heavy raft of charges Cox held was a pretext to charge exorbitant bail with the design of draining the funds of the local civil rights movement, and silencing his leadership.B. Elton Cox, Oral history interview with B. Elton Cox by Eugene Pfaff. University of North Carolina, Greensboro Digital Archive. Retrieved 8/14/2020 from http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/ref/collection/CivilRights/id/817 Cox was later acquitted of criminal conspiracy but convicted of the other three offenses and sentenced to a total of one year and nine months jail time and fined $5,700. In two separate judgments the Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed all three convictions. Both judgments were appealed.State v. Cox, 244 La. 1087, 156 So. 2d 448 (1963). Retrieved 8/14/20 from www.cite.case.law/la/244/1087/3224233/ Social context All courts adhere to the same judicial standards as the Supreme Court, but local and state courts are more immediately influenced by the political and social environments specific to their location and representative body (Vines 1965: 5). For example, during the 1950s and 1960s, the courts governing states and cities in the southern United States were more greatly influenced by the race struggles that they lived with and saw daily than courts in other areas of the country. In contrast to this, the \\"Supreme Court justices should have no constituency; they are appointed for life to sit as judges over all people.\\" (Steel 1968) Largely for this reason, Southern African Americans much preferred arguing in front of federal courts, where they felt they had a greater chance of being judged fairly and according to the law. Studies during the 1950s and 1960s show that African Americans were correct in their favoring of the federal courts over state, as federal courts decided in favor of African American defendants 60% more often than cases in Southern state courts. (Vines 1965: 10) This caused much tension and strife within the respective Southern state or community and forced the Supreme Court to rule in response to the controversial issues of race and discrimination. By late 1964, when the Supreme Court heard arguments in Cox v. Louisiana, demonstrations and protests marked a change in American society. In a 1965 New York Times editorial, James Reston spoke on protest and social change when he said \\"this rising protest in the nation is having its effect.\\" (Reston 1965: 34) Reston also said \\"the new activist spirit of the church and the university in America, allied to the modern television and airplane, is now having a profound influence on law and politics in the United States.\\" (Reston 1965) The large scale of demonstrations during this time period gained much public attention, with increased media attention and viewership. Nielsen ratings increased 46% more than average during coverage of a 1963 civil rights march in Washington DC. (see Adams, Val. \\"TV: Coverage of March\\". The New York Times August 29, 1963: p. 43.) Court's decision Justice Goldberg, writing for the court, overturned Cox's conviction. A film of the protest was a key piece of evidence, countering the State's claim that the singing from the jail turned the peaceful assembly into a riotous one; the judges watched it with rapt attention. The film showed the protest was peaceful until the police joined in. Labor unions were a factor in the Court's decision. Labor unions use picketing as a common tactic, so any case concerning public assembly is of great interest to labor groups. Justices Black and Clark made note of the obstruction charge as bad for labor picketing in their opinions, and even stated that the threat to labor picketing was their main reasoning for that decision. (Kalven 1965) In the words of one justice, Hugo L. Black, \\"Those who encourage minority groups to believe that the United States Constitution and Federal laws give them a right to patrol and picket in the streets whenever they choose, in order to advance what they think to be a just and noble end, do no service to those minority groups, their cause, or their country.\\" (Graham, pg 2) Another link with labor groups is Associate Justice Goldberg, the Justice who delivered the opinion in Cox v. Louisiana, was formerly special counsel to the major labor group the AFL-CIO (The New York Times July 16, 1960 pg. 7). Cox v. Louisiana did not provide the response and verdict that some critics believe it could have (Steel, pg. 2) Instead, the Court's response to the civil rights movement was more ambivalent and reflective of white attitudes that were against black protest. Of the three convictions of Cox, (breach of peace, picketing near the courthouse, and obstruction of a public passageway), the justices all agreed that the breach of peace conviction did not stand. The justices disagreed about the convictions of picketing near the courthouse and the obstruction of a public passageway. While the courts did upset the convictions, \\"‚Ä¶ the opinions ‚Ä¶ bristled with cautions and with a lack of sympathy for such forms of protest (Klaven pg. 8).\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 379 *Brown v.

It is the female equivalent for knighthood, which is traditionally granted to males. Dame is also style used by baronetesses in their own right. A woman appointed to the grades of Dame Commander or Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Saint John, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, Most Honourable Order of the Bath, the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, the Royal Victorian Order, or the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire becomes a dame. Since there is no female equivalent to a Knight Bachelor, women are always appointed to an order of chivalry. Women who are appointed to the Most Noble Order of the Garter or the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle are given the title of Lady rather than Dame. History The Order of the Ermine, founded by John V, Duke of Brittany in 1381, was the first order of chivalry to accept women; however, female knights existed for centuries in many places in the world prior to this.Ackermann, G. A. (1855). Ordensbuch s√§mmtlicher in Europa bl√ºhender und erloschener Orden und Ehrenzeichen. Rudolph & Dieterici. Like their male counterparts, they were distinguished by the flying of coloured banners and generally bore a coat of arms. One woman who participated in tournaments was Joane Agnes Hotot (born 1378), but she was not the only one.F.S.W. (1886) Dame Heraldry. Boston, MA: D. Lothrop and Company.Starling, E. (1856). Noble Deeds of Woman. Phillips, Sampson. Additionally, women adopted certain forms of regalia which became closely associated with the status of knighthood.De Marly, D. (1986). Working dress: a history of occupational clothing. Holmes & Meier. Unlike the male knights, it was virtually unimaginable to see women taking part in medieval battles or commanding battalions of soldiers, but there are exceptions. Joan of Arc is the most famous. Some wore armour, others commanded troops, and some were members of an official order of chivalry. One woman to wear full armour into battle was the Duchess Gaita of Lombardy (also called Sikelgaita), who rode beside her Norman mercenary husband, Robert Guiscard. She was a knight in her own right.Kasparek, R. (2014). Knight of the Grail Code. WestBow Press. Another was Petronilla de Grandmesnil, Countess of Leicester; wearing a mail hauberk with a sword and a shield, she defended her lands from Henry II of England. She and her husband participated in the rebellion in 1173 against King Henry II. However this does not mean that they were officially knighted the way men were. Formerly, a knight's wife was given the title of \\"Dame\\" before her name, but this usage was replaced by \\"Lady\\" during the 17th century. The title of dame as the official equivalent of knight was introduced in 1917 with the introduction of the Order of the British Empire, and was subsequently extended to the Royal Victorian Order in 1936, the Order of St Michael and St George, and finally the Order of the Bath in 1971. The youngest person to be appointed a dame was Ellen MacArthur at the age of 28. The oldest had been Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies at the age of 100, until Olivia de Havilland was appointed two weeks before her 101st birthday. Several high-profile figures, including actresses Geraldine McEwan and Vanessa Redgrave, have declined the honour (however Redgrave does hold the lower grade of CBE). The prefix is used with the holder's given name or full name, but never with the surname alone; this follows the same usage customs as 'Sir'.

It is the second entry in the Drakengard series, set after the events of the original Drakengard: the story revolves around Nowe, a boy raised by the dragon Legna, fighting against a tyrannical faction of knights, encountering characters from the previous game and becoming entangled in the fate of the world. Like the original, Drakengard 2 combines on-foot hack and slash with aerial combat stages and RPG game mechanics. The previous game's producer, writer and character designer returned to their respective roles. The game was designed as a more mainstream game in light of the previous game's dark aesthetic and story. The game sold 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. Western reviews praised the story, but gave mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay. A spin- off from the series, Nier, was released in 2010, while a third entry in the series, Drakengard 3, was released in December 2013 in Japan and May 2014 in North America and Europe.  Gameplay  As with the original Drakengard, the game is split into chapters and subdivided into ground-based and airborne missions. The story of the game dictates which missions come when during the initial playthrough and how they play out, though as the player progresses, new remixed versions of the various playable levels called \\"free missions\\" are unlocked, which allow the player to go through the missions with the story elements removed. The player can jump between the game world's self-contained areas via a world map unlocked after the first chapter. In between the various chapters and missions, the player builds up their characters using experience points earned in battle: the characters' weapons and abilities, and the abilities of the player's dragon, can be gradually improved. The player's view of the world is through a fixed camera, which tracks the player's progress across the player area. Collectables in the form of weapons and items such as armor and health points and items needed to progress within the level are also available for the player to seek out. The game features Normal, Hard, and Expert difficulty levels, and there are multiple weapons and items to collect throughout the levels. Combat in the game is similar to its predecessor, with the main series of missions beginning after an opening tutorial. The game features ground-based hack-and-slash gameplay and aerial combat. In ground combat, the player controls multiple characters, switching between them via the pause menu in order to use their different weapons. The characters use physical attacks using character weapons for short-range battle, while magical attacks are used for long-range attacks and groups of enemies. The magical attacks vary between the playable characters. Weapons, characters and magical abilities leave up and grow stronger as the player gains experience points in combat: weapons have a four-level cap. Aerial gameplay puts the main character atop his dragon, which is guided round by the player to attack enemy formations and large structures on the ground or enemies and airships in the sky. The player can also jump between the dragon and the ground during ground- based missions. The dragon has the ability to launch two types of fireballs: a homing variety that deals damage to single enemies, and a widespread attack which does higher damage to groups. Alongside this, the dragon can perform a special attack called \\"Dragon Overdrive\\", which kills many normal enemy units outright and deals high damage to stronger units and bosses. The dragon also gains experience and levels up through combat, dealing more damage in its attacks as it grows stronger. It also evolves and grows stronger at points directly linked to the game's narrative.  Story  = Setting and characters = Drakengard 2 takes place in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: originally said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, were engaged in a religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked their souls), and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land. The game's main character is , a Knight of the Seal gifted with superhuman powers. Nowe's companion is , a dragon who helped raise Nowe and was involved in the events of 18 years before. Accompanying Nowe on his journey is , the main antagonist of the first game who now seeks to free the people from the oppression of the Knights; , a female Knight of the Seal and Nowe's childhood friend; and a former Knight who made a pact with the Grim Reaper in exchange for his mortality. The main villain of the game is , leader of the Knights of the Seal. Returning from the first game are , the previous game's main protagonist; , the current Goddess of the Seal; and , once a companion to Caim and now the Hierarch of the Union. Minor characters include the guardians of the Seals, , and , and , who helped raise Nowe. = Plot = The game begins with Nowe becoming a fully-fledged Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins to doubt the ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong. During a second mission to ensure the protection of the seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district. Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed. Nowe and Manah head for the final seal in the District of Heavenly Time, guarded by Gismor himself. Nowe and Gismor battle, and Gismor is wounded again, transforming into a shadow-like being and using Eris to block Nowe's final attack. Believing Eris dead, Nowe and Manah pursue Gismor, but are met by Seere, who unsuccessfully tries to stop them. When they confront Gismor, he reveals himself to be a vindictive survivor of the Empire from eighteen years before. Defeated, Gismor destroys the final seal himself, releasing Angelus from her imprisonment. After Seere reveals the true consequences of Manah's actions, Nowe and Legna pursue Angelus. When they find her, they find that Angelus has been driven mad by the pain of being the final seal. Caim asks them to kill her, and as she dies, he and Angelus share a final moment together before fading away. With the seals destroyed, the world begins to fall into chaos and Manah is driven mad by the memories of her actions eighteen years before. Legna then takes Nowe to the fortress of the holy dragons, where they hear a prophecy concerning Nowe: according to the prophecy, Nowe is a New Breed created to aid the dragons in their war against the Watchers. Nowe then reunites with Eris, who had been healed by Seere, and frees Manah from her madness. Legna then takes the three to the Promised Land, a dragon stronghold that holds the Bone Casket, an object given to the dragons by and imbued with the power of the Watchers that can speed up Nowe's evolution into the New Breed. It is also where Seere has gone to initiate a new Goddess of the Seal. The game has three endings, each achieved on a separate playthrough. *Ending A: The group arrive in the Promised Land and Legna prepares to enact the prophecy, but Nowe instead chooses to find a new Goddess. Legna calls the Holy Dragons to battle, but Seere leads an army of Golems against them. With everything seeming lost, Manah and Nowe share a final kiss, which triggers Nowe's transformation into the New Breed. Nowe and Legna do battle, and Legna is killed. Eris then reveals that she is to become the new Goddess. Eris is initiated, and although the world is restored, Nowe and Manah feel sad that no other solution could be found. *Ending B: When they arrive, Legna reveals Eris' fate to become the new Goddess and Nowe chooses to follow Legna's plan. But upon trying to enter the Casket, it rejects him and fuses with Manah. Legna and Nowe battle Manah, who sacrifices herself to destroy the Bone Casket's power. Nowe, Legna and Eris then lead the Holy Dragons in their war against the Watchers. *Ending C: Events proceed as in Ending B, but when the Casket attacks Manah, she manages to win the fight against it. Legna summons the Holy Dragons and events proceed as in Ending A. After Legna's defeat and the destruction of the Bone Casket, both the Watchers and the dragons fade, leaving the world safe and humans free to create a new future for themselves. Development Drakengard 2 was announced in December 2004. Producer Takamasa Shiba and character designer Kimihiko Fujisaka returned to the team, alongside actor Shinnosuke Ikehata, who voiced the dragon Angelus and its partner Caim in the previous game. The original director, Yoko Taro, originally proposed a space adventure involving dragons, but this was vetoed at an early stage. Yoko was not involved in creating the narrative as he had been in Drakengard, being mostly tied up with another project, though he was able to observe the project's progress. He and Drakengard 2s director Akira Yasui suffered from creative differences, with the result that Yoko termed their relationship on the project as a \\"love-hate\\" story in a 2013 interview concerning the series. Their relationship inspired one of the stories created for an in-game weapon. Yoko was eventually brought on fairly late in the game's production to act as video editor for the CGI cutscenes and trailers. The CGI cutscenes were created by Studio Anima. The game's cast featured multiple film and television actors, including Ryo Katsuji, Saki Aibu, Koyuki and veteran actor Yoshio Harada. Shiba commented at the time that he felt they had gathered a very good voice cast for the game. One of the decisions Yasui made was to make Drakengard 2 far more colorful than the previous game, wanting to do something that was the \\"opposite\\" of Drakengard. In contrast to the previous game, the game contained far less of the mature themes found in the original. Shiba, speaking in a 2013 interview, said that the reason for this was that Square Enix, the company's Japanese publisher, wanted that aspect toned down to make a more mainstream game. It was designed to keep some dark aesthetics from its predecessor, with the previous game's theme of immorality as one of the key character and narrative themes, as well as themes of war and death. Other themes explored were love and hate, and the ambivalence represented in the world's prevalent factions (the Knights of the Seal, and the Cult of Watchers). Highlighted aspects of the story were the father-son relationship between Nowe and Legna, and how Manah had matured since the events of Drakengard. To promote the game in Japan, Fujisaka created a light-toned joke advertisement under the name Angelegna, referring to the original names of the two dragon characters. While Square Enix published the title in Japan, they entered an agreement with developer and publishing company Ubisoft to publish the title overseas. Ubisoft also handled the game's localization. =Character design= One of the main concepts for main protagonist Nowe was surpassing one's father. For the fight between Nowe and Legna, special gameplay functions and mechanics needed to be created for Nowe. Shiba had mixed feelings about the final fight between Legna and Nowe, which he saw as a drastic change from both the first game and the series mechanic of the protagonist riding a dragon. Shiba ended up writing their dialogue to emphasize their relationship and the difficulty of them fighting each other, paralleling earlier scenes between Caim and Angelus. The deaths of Caim and Angelus was intended to be \\"short and ruthless\\", but Yasui had it changed to the more sentimental version present in the game. Dialogue from Caim for the scene was cut from the game due to it clashing with his previous portrayal as a mute. Urick was created to be the supportive \\"big brother\\" of the party. Although the main characters were designed by Fujisaka, the character Legna, previously known as the \\"Black Dragon\\", was designed by Taro Hasegawa, who was also monster designer for both Drakengard and Drakengard 2. In addition to designing the characters, Fujisaka drew the character portraits used for character dialogue boxes during in-game cutscenes, a feature he initially objected to. Nowe, in contrast to the other protagonists of the Drakengard series, was designed around the concept of a stereotypical hero. Nowe was one of Fujisaka's favorite characters to design, although Shiba was less enthusiastic. Manah's redesign in Drakengard 2 reflected both her evolved personality and her more traditional depiction as a fantasy heroine. Elements of their designs were taken from Caim and Furiae, representing \\"passing the torch\\" between characters. Because of Legna's different roles in Drakengard and Drakengard 2, his design and movements were altered for his second incarnation. Eris's design was inspired by Casca, a character from Berserk: while he tried not to copy any parts of Casca's design, Fujisaka tried to convey it using aspects of her personality. He also tried to balance this part of her depiction with a tender and more feminine side. Another idea he had in mind was the image of an honors student. Her dance-like fighting style was generally suggested by the game's staff. Caim's redesign was meant to represent his status as a wanderer. =Music= Drakengard 2s soundtrack was composed by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki, with supervision by Nobuyoshi Sano, who worked on the music of Drakengard and acted as Sound Director for the game. The CGI cutscenes were scored by Masashi Yano. Due to criticism of his work on the first game, Sano was asked by Shiba to bring in outside help for the second game's soundtrack: Matsumoto was brought in because of his work on the songs \\"Yuki no Hana\\" and \\"Tsuki no Shizuku\\", and, Yoshiki was brought on at Matsumoto's request. The soundtrack was designed to be a fusion of J-pop and conventional video game music, and to evoke the emotions of the various characters and the feeling of battle. The game's theme song in Japan, \\"Hitori\\", was sung by Mika Nakashima, who also worked as a sound producer. The theme song for the game's English release was \\"Growing Wings\\", a localized version of the first game's theme song sung by Kari Wahlgren.  Reception  Drakengard 2 sold well in Japan. The game was considered a hit in Japan by Ubisoft, selling 100,000 units in its first week, and reaching sales of 170,000 units by the end of the month, becoming the second best-selling game of June behind Sega's GBA port of Mushiking: King of the Beetles. It eventually sold just over 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. The game was eventually re-released as part of Square Enix's Ultimate Hits series, re-releases of high-selling titles. Drakengard 2 received a score of 30/40 from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu. The game received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The story received mixed to positive reviews. IGN's Ed Lewis said it \\"admirably [continued] the bizarre and fantastically medieval world that was established in the original game.\\", while GameSpot's Greg Meuller called it \\"Interesting [...] with plenty of twists and turns\\". Eurogamer's Simon Parkin cited the story as being very good, though he found Nowe \\"a little nauseating to watch as the weighty, dark (and pretty good) plot unfolds\\", and VideoGamer.com's Adam Jarvis called the story \\"one of the highlights of the package\\". The 1UP reviewer called the \\"clear undercurrent of \\"maybe the good guys are the bad guys,\\"\\" one of the main reasons to keep playing the game. In contrast, the reviewer for GameTrailers called it \\"a cookie-cutter RPG plot\\" where players could \\"predict nearly every plot twist the game throws at [them].\\", The graphics received mixed reviews. Lewis called them \\"more interesting than the first game, but marginally so\\", and Meuller called them \\"dated\\", with environments seeming \\"bland and drab, and the enemies [looking] generic\\". The GameTrailers reviewer praised the character animations, but cited the environments as bland and felt that there were too few FMVs and too many game engine-driven cutscenes, which he described as \\"awful\\". Parkin criticized the game's graphic capacities, commenting that players would \\"stop watching the main screen instead fixing upon the little map in the corner to guide your character towards hostile red dots that only materialize polygonal just seconds before you lock swords.\\", while Jarvis said that it had not improved from the previous game and called the colors \\"very murky, drab and dark\\". 1UP said that the graphics \\"[don't] hold up to the visual quality of Cavia's other titles like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex [or] Naruto: Uzumaki Ninden\\". The gameplay was universally criticized. Parkin called the battle gameplay \\"lightweight\\" and the balance between ground and aerial combat poor despite a good character leveling system, while Lewis described it as being without strategy, with the game \\"just dumping in more boring enemies to wade through\\". GameTrailers said that there was \\"nothing new here.\\", while Meuller called it \\"dull at best and frustrating at worst\\". 1UP said that the combat was \\"almost sickening to look at.\\", though he cited the RPG elements as a redeeming feature. Jarvis simply called the gameplay \\"Same old, same old\\", citing it as a major fault of the game.  Legacy  In September 2013, the game was given an honorable mention among Kotaku Tim Rogers as one of the best games on the PS2. Rogers gave praise to the game's parry mechanic and atmosphere. In the year of its release in Japan, the game received a novelization written by Emi Nagashima under her pen name of Jun Eishima. Yoko and Shiba teamed up again to create another game in the series, but that eventually developed into Nier, a spin-off from the first game's fifth ending. After Niers release, Cavia was absorbed into AQ Interactive, then Yoko left to become a freelance. An attempt by Shiba to begin development of a third Drakengard game at AQ Interactive were unsuccessful. Drakengard 3 was eventually unveiled in 2013, with Shiba, Yoko and Fujisaka returning to their former roles and the story being set before the original game. Both Shiba and Yoko have voiced their willingness to continue the series on next-generation consoles if there were sufficient sales and funds, while Yoko also expressed interest in making a second spin-off, although he did not specify whether it would be set in the world of Nier or not.

South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court ruling that the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution forbade state government officials to force a crowd to disperse when they are otherwise legally marching in front of a state house.  Background  The 187 petitioners consisted of African-American high school and college students who peacefully assembled at the Zion Baptist Church in Columbia, South Carolina on March 2, 1961. The students marched in separate groups of roughly 15 to South Carolina State House grounds to peacefully express their grievances regarding civil rights of African-Americans. The crowd of petitioners did not engage in any violent conduct and did not threaten violence in any manner, nor did crowds gathering to witness the demonstration engage in any such behavior. Petitioners were told by police officials that they must disperse within 15 minutes or face arrest. The petitioners failed to disperse, opting to sing religious and patriotic songs instead. Petitioners were convicted of the common law crime of breach of the peace.  Outcome  The Supreme Court held that in arresting, convicting and punishing the petitioners, South Carolina infringed on the petitioners' rights of free speech, free assembly and freedom to petition for a redress of grievances. The Court stated that these rights are guaranteed by the First Amendment and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by the States. The Supreme Court argued the arrests and convictions of 187 marchers were an attempt by South Carolina to \\"make criminal the peaceful expression of unpopular views\\" where the marchers' actions were an exercise of First Amendment rights \\"in their most pristine and classic form.\\" The Court described the common law crime of breach of the peace as \\"not susceptible of exact definition.\\". = Clark's dissent = While the majority in Edwards distinguished Feiner v. New York (1951), based on the absence of violence or threats from the petitioners' march to the state capital, Justice Clark stated that the breach of the peace convictions upheld in Feiner presented \\"a situation no more dangerous than that found here.\\" Justice Clark noted that Edwards was more dangerous because Feiner involved one person and was limited to a crowd of about 80, whereas the Edwards demonstration involved around 200 demonstrators and 300 onlookers. He argued that the City Manager's action may have averted a catastrophe because of the \\"almost spontaneous combustion in some Southern communities in such a situation.\\"Edwards, 372 U.S. at 244 (Clark, J., dissenting).

Speed Queen is a subsidiary of Alliance Laundry Systems LLC, which billed itself as the world's largest manufacturer of commercial laundry equipment as of 2004. Products Speed Queen makes a large variety of residential and commercial products, from -capacity tumblers to washer-extractors, as well as dryers. Its commercial machines are a popular brand for laundromats, apartment buildings, and hotels. As summarized by product review website Wirecutter in 2018, Speed Queen's top-loader washing machines have a reputation for being \\"wasteful [and] ineffective\\", requiring much more energy and water than modern front- loading washers, however on the other hand are regarded as \\"exceptionally durable and repairable\\", with fans also praising their ability to thoroughly clean heavily soiled work clothes. A 2018 design change, revealed as the TR7, introduced what the company described as a \\"radically different\\" washing mechanism, abandoning the separate movement of agitator and tub for which Speed Queen laundry machines had previously been known for. The design faced criticism, receiving only a 4.2 rating from CNET, who described the design as that it \\"doesn't clean nearly enough to recommend it to everyone.\\" It also received a \\"poor\\" rating by Consumer Reports (CR) for cleaning clothes--the only washer tested by CR to receive such a rating. On the \\"heavy cycle\\" CR said the cleaning rating would be \\"fair\\". In 2019, Speed Queen effectively reverted to the separate agitator and tub with the release of the TC5. History 231x231pxThe company was founded in 1908 by Joe Barlow and John Seelig as Barlow & Seelig Manufacturing. They got their start by taking existing machine designs and improving them. In 1922, Speed Queen was the first company to introduce washers with nickel-copper tubs. The brand name \\"Speed Queen\\" was created in 1928. During World War II, it switched production to support the war effort, manufacturing 20 mm shells, and parts for airplanes, tanks and guns. Later, it was sold to McGraw-Edison Company (which also owned Eskimo fans and Toastmaster), and then to Raytheon. In 1998, Raytheon Commercial Laundry sold the brand to Alliance Laundry Systems.

He relinquished his princely title at an early age. During his school years, he became interested in the poetry of Russian symbolism and started writing poems himself. World War One Mirsky saw service in the Russian army during World War I and joined the White movement as a member of Denikin's staff. London Mirsky emigrated to Great Britain in 1921. While teaching Russian literature at the University of London, Mirsky published his landmark study A History of Russian Literature: From Its Beginnings to 1880. Vladimir Nabokov has called it \\"the best history of Russian literature in any language including Russian\\". This work was followed with the Contemporary Russian Literature, 1881-1925,. Mirsky was a founding member of the Eurasia Movement and the chief editor of the periodical Eurasia, his own views gradually evolving toward Marxism. He also is usually credited with coining the term National Bolshevism. In 1931, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and asked Maxim Gorky if he could procure his pardon by Soviet authorities. The permission to return to the USSR was granted him in 1932. On seeing him off to Russia, Virginia Woolf wrote in her diary that \\"soon there'll be a bullet through your head\\". Return to Russia Mirsky returned to Russia in September 1932.Roberts, I.W. (1991) History of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, 1915-1990. London: School of Slavonic and East European Studies. p. 29. Five years later, during the Great Purge, Mirsky was arrested by the NKVD. Mirsky‚Äôs arrest may have been caused by a chance meeting with his friend, the British historian E. H. Carr who was visiting the Soviet Union in 1937.Jonathan Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, E.H. Carr, 1892‚Äì1982 (London; New York: Verso, 1999), p. 76. Carr stumbled into Prince Mirsky on the streets of Leningrad (modern Saint Petersburg, Russia), and despite Prince Mirsky's best efforts to pretend not to know him, Carr persuaded his old friend to have lunch with him.Haslam, The Vices of Integrity, p. 76. Since this was at the height of the Yezhovshchina, and any Soviet citizen who had any unauthorised contact with a foreigner was likely to be regarded as a spy, the NKVD arrested Mirsky as a British spy. He died in one of the gulag labour camps near Magadan in June 1939 and was buried on the 7th of that month. He was rehabilitated in 1962. Although his magnum opus was eventually published in Russia, Mirsky's reputation in his native country remains sparse. Korney Chukovsky gives a lively portrait of Mirsky in his diary entry for 27 January 1935: > I liked him enormously: the vast erudition, the sincerity, the literary > talent, the ludicrous beard and ludicrous bald spot, the suit which, though > made in England, hung loosely on him, shabby and threadbare, the way he had > of coming out with a sympathetic ee-ee-ee (like a guttural piglet squeal) > after each sentence you uttered‚Äîit was all so amusing and endearing. Though > he had very little money‚Äîhe's a staunch democrat‚Äîhe did inherit his well- > born ancestors' gourmandise. His stomach will be the ruin of him. Every day > he leaves his wretched excuse for a cap and overcoat with the concierge and > goes into the luxurious restaurant [of the Hotel National in Moscow], > spending no less than forty rubles on a meal (since he drinks as well as > eats) plus four to tip the waiter and one to tip the concierge.Kornei > Chukovsky, Diary, 1901-1969 (Yale University Press, 2005: ), p. 313.  Criticism  Malcolm Muggeridge, who met Mirsky after his return to USSR, apparently met one of the author's critics, a French correspondent to Russia named Luciani, who had this to say of Mirsky: \\"Mirsky had pulled off the unusual feat of managing to be a parasite under three regimes ‚Äî as a prince under Czarism, as a professor under Capitalism, and as an homme-de-lettres under Communism.\\" George Orwell was highly critical of The Intelligentsia of Great Britain Orwell, George The Road to Wigan Pier but Tariq Ali had a more favourable assessment of this book.Ali, Tariq The Coming British Revolution Selected publications * Anthology of Russian poetry (1924) * Modern Russian Literature (1925) * Pushkin (1926) * A History of Russian Literature: From Its Beginnings to 1900 in two volumes (1926, 1927); repr.

The subject is standing by a window and a large map of the Low Countries hangs on the wall behind. It is signed to the right of the girl \\"I [Oannes] Ver. Meer\\", but not dated. Most experts assume it was executed sometime between 1665/1668, but some suggest the work could have been created as late as 1670‚Äì1675. In 1663 Vermeer had been visited by Balthasar de Monconys, but had no painting to show, so it was possibly done \\"in order to have an outstanding specimen of his art in his studio.\\"Vermeer and the Delft School, p. 396 Vermeer obviously liked the painting; he never sold it during his lifetime. According to Alpers \\"it stands as a kind of summary and assessment of what has been done.\\"S. Alpers, p. 122.KHM on the \\"Art of Painting\\" =Elements= Detail of Vermeer's Art of Painting showing the painter at his easel using a maulstick. The painting has only two figures, the painter and his subject, a woman with downcast eyes. The painter was thought to be a self-portrait of the artist; Jean-Louis Vaudoyer suggested the young woman could be his daughter.Vermeer's Family Secrets: Genius, Discovery, and the Unknown Apprentice by Benjamin Binstock, p. 172. The painter sits in front of the painting on the easel, where you can see the sketch of the crown. He is dressed in an elegant black garment with cuts on the sleeves and on the back that offers a glimpse of the shirt underneath. He has short puffy breeches and orange stockings, an expensive and fashionable garment that is also found in other works of the time, as in a well-known self-portrait by Rubens. The tapestry and the chair, both repoussoirs, lead the viewer into the painting. As in The Allegory of Faith the ceiling can be seen. Experts attribute symbols to various aspects of the painting. A number of the items, a plaster mask, perhaps representing the debate on paragone,Essential Vermeer. the presence of a piece of cloth, a folio, and some leather on the table have been linked to the symbols of Liberal Arts. The representation of the marble tiled floor and the splendid golden chandelier are examples of Vermeer's craftsmanship and show his knowledge of perspective. Each object reflects or absorbs light differently, getting the most accurate rendering of material effects.

Following Vermeer's contemporary Gerard de Lairesse, interested in French Classicism and Ripa, there is another explanation; he mentions history and poetry as the main resources of a painter.Groot-Schilderboek (1712), pp. 4, 6, 115, 121, 293Weber, Gregor J.M. (1991) Der Lobtopos des 'lebenden' Bildes: Jan Vos und sein \\"Zeege der Schilderkunst\\" von 1654, p. 61. .

Is that a double eagle on top of the chandelier?Kroonluchter The double-headed eagle, symbol of the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, which possibly adorns the central golden chandelier, may represent the former rulers of the Low Countries. The large map on the back wall has a prominent crease that divides the Seventeen Provinces into the north and south. (West is at the top of the map.) The crease may symbolize the division between the Dutch Republic to the north and southern provinces under Habsburg rule. The map shows the earlier political division between the Union of Utrecht to the north, and the loyal provinces to the south.Vermeer: The Art of Painting, Exhibitions ‚Äì NGA This interpretation might have appealed to Hitler who owned the painting during the war.Vermeer's Family Secrets: Genius, Discovery, and the Unknown Apprentice by Benjamin Binstock, p. 182. According to Liedtke a political interpretation of the map and the Habsburg eagle is unconvincing; they overlook other motives.Vermeer and the Delft School, p. 396 The map could suggest though that painting has brought fame to the Netherlands;Vermeer and the Delft School, p. 396 ships sailing over the folds suggest that. Provenance The painting is considered a work with significance for Vermeer because he did not part with it or sell it, even when he was in debt. On 24 February 1676, his widow Catharina bequeathed it to her mother, Maria Thins, in an attempt to avoid the sale of the painting to satisfy creditors.Montias, J.M. (1989) Vermeer and his Milieu. A Web of Social History, pp. 338‚Äì339. The executor of Vermeer's estate, the famous Delft microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, determined that the transferral of the work to the late painter's mother-in-law was illegal and, according to John Michael Montias, at least a curious transaction.Vermeer and His Milieu: A Web of Social History by John M. Montias, pp. 219, 229. On 15 March 1677 most of his paintings were sold in an auction at the Guild in Delft.Essential Vermeer It is not known who bought the Art of Painting; perhaps it was Jacob Dissius.BESITZFOLGEN It can not be determined with certainty whether the painting is quoted in the auction Dissius of 1696 as \\"Portrait of Vermeer in a room with various accessories.\\" The painting was owned by Gerard van Swieten, and passed into the hands of Gottfried van Swieten.U.S. National Gallery In 1813, it was purchased for 50 florins by the Bohemian-Austrian Count Rudolf Czernin. It was placed on public display in the Czernin Museum in Vienna. Until 1860, the painting was considered to have been painted by Vermeer's contemporary, Pieter de Hooch; Vermeer was little-known until the late 19th century. Hooch's signature was even forged on the painting. It was at the intervention of the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen that it was recognised as a Vermeer original.Waagen, G.F. \\"Handbuch der Deutschen und Niederl√§ndischen Malerschulen\\".

The painting was escorted to Vienna from Munich by Andrew Ritchie, chief of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (MFA&A;) for Austria, who transported it by locking himself and the painting in a train compartment.Spirydowicz, K.

During the early to mid-1950s, Czernin continued in his attempts to claim restitution, each time being rejected. In 1958, Vermeer's The Art of Painting was finally moved from temporary status into the permanent collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.NGA = 2009 request by heirs for restitution = In August 2009, a request was submitted by the heirs of the Czernin family to Austria's culture ministry for the return of the painting.

He is criticized by some art critics for what they consider neo-academism, but praised by others, such as Robert Hughes, who consider him a master realist. His style sometimes is deemed hyperrealistic. His painting was the subject of the film El Sol del Membrillo, by Victor Erice, in 1992. Early life L√≥pez Garc√≠a was born on 6 January 1936 in Tomelloso, Ciudad Real, a few months before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. It first appeared that Antonio would continue in the family tradition as a farmer, but an early facility for drawing caught the attention of his uncle Antonio Lopez Torres, a local painter of landscapes, who gave him his first lessons. In 1949 he moved to Madrid in order to study for entrance to the competitive Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Postwar period Between 1950 and 1955 he studied art at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando,http://www.mfa.org/dynamic/sub/ctr_link_url_6422.pdf winning a number of prizes. While at the school he developed a friendship with Mar√≠a Moreno‚Äîalso a painter‚Äîwhom he would marry in 1961. He also formed friendships with Francisco Lopez Hernandez, Amalia Avia, and Isabel Quintanilla. Out of this nucleus a realist group, the New Spanish Realists, was formed in Madrid. L√≥pez Garcia became friends with Jack Chambers, a Canadian studying in Madrid. Although Chambers did not belong to the New Spanish Realists, parallels to their style can be found in his work created in Canada in the late 1960s.Cheetham, Mark. Jack Chambers: Life & Work. Toronto: Art Canada Institute, 2013. E-Book. 5. Madrid of the postwar period was isolated from the international panorama of art and culture. All the information that L√≥pez Garc√≠a accessed on contemporary art was derived from library books at the school; he gradually became aware of Picasso and other great artists of the period. In 1955, a scholarship allowed him to travel to Italy with Francisco Lopez and study Italian painting from the Renaissance. During this period he began to reevaluate Spanish painting in the Prado, especially Vel√°zquez, a constant reference. Varieties of realism By 1957 his work had registered a certain surreal quality. Figures and objects appear to float in space and his pictures are populated by images removed from their contexts. The fantastic vein remains at least until 1964. During this period Antonio L√≥pez shows an increasing interest in the representation of objects, independent of their contained narrative load. Magic Realism continued to inform his work through the mid-1960s, but gradually, as he said, \\"the physical world gained more prestige in my eyes.\\" In fact he had never abandoned it. The 1959 oil Francisco Carretero and A. L√≥pez Garc√≠a Talking, like many portraits and townscapes of this period, is devoid of surrealistic devices. So are Autumn (1961) and The Sea (1961-70). Some of his relief sculptures conjure fantastic episodes, such as The Apparition (1963), in which a child hovers mid-air against a wall, gliding toward an open door. There are many affinities with the Tuscan Renaissance in his work in three dimensions. The ethereal Head of Carmencita (1965-68), for example, might at first glance be taken for a quattrocento Florentine bronze by Desiderio da Settignano. Garc√≠a's painting also reverberates with the art of the past. The Grapevine (1960) evokes Tiepolo's sunlight, The Quince Tree (1962) Chardin's dusky murk, and other paintings echo Old Masters from D√ºrer to Degas. Woman in the bathtub, oil on canvas, 1968 by Antonio L√≥pez Garcia, The beauty of L√≥pez Garc√≠a's work begins with an appreciation of his craft. Paintings such as The Sideboard (1965-66), or the atmospheric views of Madrid from the 1970s, show an acute perception and understanding of the beauty of the objects he portrays. Though L√≥pez Garc√≠a is devoted to the mundane‚Äîhe depicts humble people, buildings, plants, and cluttered interiors‚Äîhis portrayal of these subjects is compelling and beautiful. Starkly lit studies of his studio, bathroom, and the red brick wall in his backyard underscore an interest in prosaic subject matter. His deftness brings attention to these simple forms, encouraging the viewer to re-examine the presence of ordinary objects. He began to paint panoramic views of Madrid about 1960. His work from this period attracted recognition, first within Spain‚Äîin 1961 he had his first solo show in Madrid‚Äîand later, in 1965 and 1968, at the Staempfli Gallery in New York. L√≥pez Garc√≠a faithfully adhered to familiar subjects: images of women, anonymous and humble objects of domestic surroundings, desolate spaces, images of his garden and landscape. The pictures are sometimes worked on for more than twenty years, some of them remaining unfinished. As the artist explains, \\"the pictorial nucleus begins to grow and you work until the whole surface has an expressive intensity equivalent to what you have before you, converted into a pictorial reality.\\" He is a versatile realist, proficient in the traditional media of pencil drawing, oil painting on board, carved wood sculpture, and bas relief in plaster. Exhibitions Because he is not prolific, Garc√≠a has had only a handful of one-artist shows. His first individual show was held at the Ateneo de Madrid in 1957. Three have been in New York: two in the 1960s and one, in 1986, at his current representative, the Marlborough Gallery. In 2008 he was featured in a solo exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The exhibition included the two enormous bronze heads he sculpted of his grandchildren, which were placed on the front lawn of the Museum of Fine Arts. Boston Art Commission His work is in several major U.S. museum collections. Street of Santa Rita, oil on canvas, 1961 by Antonio L√≥pez Garcia He currently has a temporary exhibit at the Thyssen Museum in Madrid. Recognition and influence During most of his career, Antonio L√≥pez Garc√≠a worked amidst an artistic culture dominated first by abstraction and later by conceptual currents. In the 1960s and the 1970s, his prestige quietly grew. It is possible to establish links between his work and the new European figurative tendencies or the American hyperrealism. L√≥pez Garcia has won numerous awards. After winning the III National Art Contest in his final year of art school, he was awarded a trip to Italy by the Spanish Ministry of Education, in order to study the works of Renaissance masters. He has also been awarded the Medalla de Oro from Castilla-La Mancha and the Community of Madrid, in 1986 and 1990, respectively. In 2004, L√≥pez was inducted as an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Letters in New York, and in 2006 he was awarded the Vel√°zquez Prize for Fine Arts.http://www.mfa.org/dynamic/sub/ctr_link_url_6422.pdf Films L√≥pez is featured in an award-winning 1992 film, El Sol del Membrillo, directed by Victor Erice and written by both. The film, which portrays L√≥pez's struggles to paint, and then draw, a small quince tree growing in the backyard of his studio, gives considerable attention to his almost fanatically exacting working methods.

A convicted car thief, Veniamin was a key figure in the Melbourne underworld killings, suspected of both murdering seven underworld figures, and being a hit-man for the Williams crime family. Veniamin was killed by Domenic \\"Mick\\" Gatto at a La Porcella Italian restaurant in Carlton. Gatto claimed it was in self-defence following a heated argument. Early and personal life Veniamin was born to Greek Cypriot immigrant parents, and was raised in the Western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine. From a child to his early teens, Veniamin was an altar boy at the St Andrew's Greek Orthodox Church in the neighbouring suburb of Sunshine West, where his funeral was later held. Veniamin worked at the West Melbourne wholesale fruit and vegetable market. A few years before his death, Veniamin fathered a daughter as the result of a casual affair. He was also a known associate of Dino Dibra who was murdered at his home in October 2000, and of Paul Kallipolitis, who was shot in similar circumstances two years later. Victoria Police say Veniamin was one of the most dangerous and feared men connected to Melbourne's crime scene, and by the time of his death in 2004 they had connected him with several of Melbourne's underworld murders. Ironically, the church where he was made an altar boy and his funeral was held, was also no more than a block away from the Sunshine West house that Dibra was killed out front of. Veniamin met with Nik Radev on 15 April 2003, the day Radev was murdered in Coburg. Veniamin associated with an underworld group known as The Carlton Crew and after 2003 was connected with the Williams Family, and was a close friend of Carl Williams. Relationship with Roberta Williams He was a close friend of Carl Williams and his wife Roberta. Although Roberta had previously rejected claims she and Veniamin were intimate, in early 2009 she admitted that he was her soulmate. She said that every Tuesday he would pick her daughters up and take them to religion classes, bring them home and give them a bath. He said his favourite day of the week was Tuesday and Roberta said her younger daughter, Dhakota, idolised him. Death Veniamin died in the La Porcella restaurant in Carlton on 23 March 2004 at around 2.30pm after being shot by former associate Domenic \\"Mick\\" Gatto. Gatto was charged with his murder but acquitted on self-defence grounds. During the trial, Gatto claimed Veniamin had pulled out a .38 pistol and threatened to kill him, when they were together in an enclosed area at the back of the restaurant. There were no witnesses. Gatto claims Veniamin lost his temper after being told that \\"he'd rather [Veniamin] not come around near [Gatto's group of friends] at all\\", that Veniamin drew a gun and that during a struggle he was able to turn the gun around on Veniamin and fire one shot into his neck, and one shot into the eye. Gatto also claimed that before Veniamin lost his temper, Veniamin had implicated himself in the deaths of Dino Dibra, Paul Kallipolitis and Graham Kinniburgh; he is also believed to have killed underworld figure Victor Pierce. His funeral was held at the Greek Orthodox Church in Sunshine West, in western Melbourne, the same church where he had been an altar boy. In popular culture In the first season of drama series Underbelly, Veniamin was portrayed by actor Damian Walshe-Howling.

Biblical source In some listings of the 613 commandments, such as the Minchat Chinuch, the biblical obligation to consume maror is included within the commandment to consume the meat of the sacrificial Paschal offering.Minchat Chinuch 6:14 u'v'mitzvah Ever since the Paschal offering ceased to exist with the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, the obligation to consume maror on the first night of Passover has been rabbinical in nature. The only two biblical reference to the maror is the verse quoted above (Exodus 12:8) in which it is mentioned in reference to the offering, and in Numbers 9:11 where \\"They are to eat the lamb, together with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs\\". This is in contradistinction to the obligation to consume matzo on the first night of Passover, which remains a biblical commandment even in the absence of the Paschal Lamb, because there are other biblical verses that mention matzo as a standalone obligation (Exodus 12:18, Deuteronomy 16:8) The word derives from the Hebrew word ( or ‚Äì 'bitter'), and thus may be related to the English word myrrh (through Aramaic , cognate with Arabic ). Symbolism According to the Haggadah, the traditional text which is recited at the Seder and which defines the Seder's form and customs, the maror symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in Egypt. The following verse from the Torah underscores that symbolism: \\"And they embittered (ve-yimareru ◊ï◊ô◊û◊®◊®◊ï) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor\\" (Exodus 1:14). Use at the Seder Maror is one of the foods placed on the Passover Seder Plate and there is a rabbinical requirement to eat maror at the Seder. Chazeret () is used for the requirement called korech, in which the maror is eaten together with matzo. There are various customs about the kinds of maror placed at each location. During the Seder, each participant recites a specific blessing over the maror and eats it. It is first dipped into the charoset--a brown, pebbly mixture which symbolizes the mortar with which the Israelites bound bricks for the Egyptians. The excess charoset is then shaken off and the maror is eaten. The halakha (Jewish Law) prescribes the minimum amount of maror that should be eaten to fulfill the mitzvah (a kazayis or kezayit, literally meaning the volume of an olive) and the amount of time in which it should be consumed. To fulfill the obligation, the flavor of the maror must be unadulterated by cooking or preservatives, such as being soaked in vinegar.Mishna Pesachim 2:6 Types of maror The MishnahPesahim 2:6 specifies five types of bitter herbs eaten on the night of Passover: ·∏•azzeret (lettuce),  øuleshƒ´n (endive/chicory), temakha, ·∏•ar·∏•avina (possibly melilot, or Eryngium creticum), and maror (likely Sonchus oleraceus, sowthistle). The most common vegetables currently used as bitter herbs are horseradish and romaine lettuce. =Hazzeret= Hazzeret is undoubtedly domestic lettuceThus explained in Rabbi Hai Gaon's Commentary on Mishnah Uktzin 1:2 [3]; Sefer Arukh, s.v. ◊ó◊ñ◊®◊™; Mishnah Commentary of Rabbi Nathan, President of the Academy, s.v. Mishnah Kila'im 1:2; Zohar Amar, Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings, Kefar Darom 2015, p. 77 [Hebrew]., and the word is cognate to other near-eastern terms for lettuce. While in the past, domestic lettuce was bitter, modern varieties are only slightly bitter or not at all, such as iceberg lettuce and romaine lettuce. Heirloom varieties of lettuce are still available to gardeners that are bitter. Romaine lettuce is the most commonly used variety, perhaps because it still preserves a slight bitter taste, though all domestic varieties constitute Hazzereth. Romaine lettuce is not initially bitter, but becomes so later on, which is symbolic of the experience of the Jews in Egypt.Talmud, Pesachim 39a The \\"later\\" bitterness of lettuce refers to fact that lettuce plants become bitter after they \\"bolt\\" (flower), a process which occurs naturally when days lengthen or temperatures rise.Why Lettuce Bolts and How to Stop It Wild or prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), is listed in Tosefta Pisha as suitable for maror under the name ◊ó◊ñ◊®◊™ ◊î◊í◊ú or ◊ó◊ñ◊®◊™ ◊í◊ú◊ô◊ü. However, its absence from the approved list in the Mishnah and Talmud indicate that it is not halakhically suitable. =\`Ulshin= The second species listed in the Mishnah is \`ulshin, which is a plural to refer to both wild and cultivated typesTB Pesahim 39 a of plants in the genus Cichorium.Yehuda Felix, Mareos Hamishna. Source The term is cognate to other near-eastern terms for endives, such as Aramaic ◊¢◊ú◊™ and Arabic \`alath. =Tamcha= The Talmud Yershalmi identified Hebrew Tamcha with Greek Œ≥ŒπŒ≥Œ≥ŒØŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ, which has been positively identified via the illustration in the Vienna Dioscurides as the wild carrot Daucus gingidium.The Jerusalem Talmud (Pesahim 2:5 [18a]) calls the ◊™◊û◊õ◊î by the name ◊í◊†◊í◊ô◊ì◊ô◊ü (Gingidium), which, according to Dioscorides (Book II‚Äì167), is a kind of chervil, and can apply to any of the following genera: Chaerophyllum, Anthriscus, Chaetosciadium and Scandix. Of these, the most commonly grown chervil in Israel is Chaetosciadium trichospermum. Cf. William Smith (ed.), Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, Third edition, New York 1858, s.v. Œ≥ŒπŒ≥Œ≥ŒØŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ (\\"gingidium\\"), \\"a kind of chervil.\\" Ibn Baytar, citing Galen, explains Gingidium as rather meaning a species of wild carrot (e.g. Daucus gingidium, or something similar). This view is accepted by Pliny the Elder who, in his Natural History (Book XX, ch. XVI), wrote: \\"In Syria very great pains are taken over kitchen- gardens; hence the Greek proverb: 'Syrians have plenty of vegetables.' They sow a vegetable called by some gingidion that is very like staphylinus (=parsnip; carrot), only it is slighter and more bitter, though its properties are the same. It is eaten, cooked or raw, with great advantage to the stomach, for it dries up all its humours, however deep these may lie.\\" Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller, in his Tosafot Yom-Tov, identified the Mishna's \\"temakha\\" with Yiddish \\"chreyn\\" (horseradish). This identification has long been recognized as problematic, as horseradish does not grow natively in Israel and was not available to Jews in the Mishnaic period. Many Jews use horseradish condiment (a mixture of cooked horseradish, beetroot and sugar), though the Shulchan Aruch requires that maror be used as is, that is raw, and not cooked or mixed with salt, vinegar, sugar, lemon, or beets.Orach Chaim 473:5 =Harhavina= The identity of harhavina is somewhat disputed.El'ad Kapah, The Identification of the Mishna Plants According to Rabbi Nathan's Commentary of the Mishna, Ramat-Gan 2007, p. 48 (Hebrew); Zohar Amar, Flora and Fauna in Maimonides' Teachings, Kfar Darom 2015, pp. 88‚Äì89 . It is variously identified as a vine growing around palms, a type of thistle, or a type of acacia. It may be melilot or Eryngium creticum. =Maror= The identity of this autohyponym which names the vegetables suitable for the mitzvah was preserved among the Jews of Yemen as the plant Sonchus oleraceus, a relative of dandelion native to Israel.Adin Steinsaltz, Talmud Bavli ‚Äì explained, punctuated and translated\\", Pesachim, volume A, p. 276 References Passover foods Passover seder Jewish ceremonial food and drink Positive Mitzvoth ","title":"Maror"},{"id":"2963903","text":"Aston Flamville is a village and civil parish in the Blaby district in Leicestershire, England.

Sammet (March 23, 1928 ‚Äì May 20, 2017) was an American computer scientist who developed the FORMAC programming language in 1962. She was also one of the developers of the influential COBOL programming language. She received her B.A. in Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1948 and her M.A. in Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1949. She received an honorary D.Sc. from Mount Holyoke College in 1978.Stanley, Autumn, Mothers and Daughters of Invention, Metuchen, New Jersey: Scarecrow Press, 1993, p. 683 Sammet was employed by Sperry Gyroscope from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group. From 1958 to 1961, she worked for Sylvania as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original COBOL group. She joined IBM in 1961 where she developed FORMAC, the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. At IBM she researched the use of restricted English as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs. She was Programming Technology Planning Manager for the Federal Systems Division from 1968 to 1974, and was appointed Software Technology Manager in 1979. Sammet founded the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SICSAM) in 1965 and was Chair of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN). She was the first female president of the ACM, from 1974 to 1976.Stanley, Mothers and Daughters of Invention, p. 685  Early life  Jean E. Sammet was born on March 23, 1928 in New York City. Jean and her sister Helen were born to Harry and Ruth Sammet who were both lawyers. Jean and Helen attended public elementary schools in Manhattan. Sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the Bronx High School of Science because it did not accept girls. Instead, Sammet attended Julia Richman High School. Sammet chose to enroll at Mount Holyoke College based on the strength of its mathematics program. Sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses, which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in New York. She minored in political science. After graduating from Mount Holyoke, Sammet pursued graduate studies at the University of Illinois, where she received her MA in 1949. While taking courses toward a Ph.D., she was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics department at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1951. When Sammet first encountered a computer, in 1949 at the University of Illinois, she was not impressed, considering it an obscene piece of hardware. In 1951 Sammet began looking for a position in education. Sammet was forced to search for positions in New Jersey because New York City was not hiring new teachers. The authorities in New Jersey determined that Sammet was missing two courses from her studies: a course in education and one in the history of New Jersey. Sammet fought this determination, stating that her knowledge of New Jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school. This forced Sammet to seek other types of employment.  Work  In 1951, Sammet took a position at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a trainee actuary. She agreed to participate in an in-house training program to learn about punched card accounting machines. Sammet took to the electronic accounting machines, but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete. She left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Sammet worked as a teaching assistant at Barnard College during the 1952-1953 school year before she decided that the academic life was not for her. From 1953 to 1958, Sammet was a mathematician for Sperry Gyroscope in New York. She spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer. Sammet worked on the Department of the Navy‚Äôs submarine program during her time there. In early January 1955, Sammet began her life as a programmer. Sperry Gyroscope was working on a digital computer, the Sperry Electronic Digital Automatic Computer (SPEEDAC) and asked Sammet to be their programmer. Her first task was to write the basic loader for the SPEEDAC, which was a 20-line program that took three days to toggle into the computer by hand in binary. Sammet became the group leader of what was called an ‚Äúopen shop‚Äù as Sperry began hiring more programmers. The ‚Äúopen shop‚Äù consisted of programmers acting as consultants to the engineers and involved scientists who assisted them in writing and testing their routines. The group produced other system software and focused on scientific and engineering computations. In 1955 Sperry Gyroscope and Remington Rand merged and became Sperry Rand. This merger allowed Sammet access to the UNIVAC I computer and Grace Hopper. In fall of 1956, Sammet taught one of the earliest graduate-level courses in computer programming in the Applied Mathematics department of Adelphi College (now University) on Long Island. Despite the fact that Adelphi did not have a computer and few textbooks on programming existed at the time, Sammet was able to instruct two courses for two years. Sammet decided to leave Sperry to work for a company with computers as its focal point. The classified job advertisements at the time were separated by gender and Sammet was unable to find a position for a woman in any field she was interested in so she decided to scan the men‚Äôs list and found an engineer position at Sylvania Electric Products in Needham, Massachusetts. Sammet was instead hired to oversee software development for the MOBIDIC project by Carl Hammer, the person responsible for Sylvania‚Äôs software development. In 1959, Sammet and five other programmers established much of the design of the influential COBOL programming language, in a proposal written in a span of two weeks that was eventually accepted by Sylvania's U.S. government clients.  Ties to ACM  Around 1965 or 1966, Sammet noticed a need for the exchange of intellectual information with others working with languages and software while she worked on FORMAC. She was a member of ACM for a number of years but was not active until she became interested in starting a special interest group that would allow her to speak with other professionals in the field. After a couple of failed attempts at contacting the person in charge of Special Interest Groups and Special Interest Committees at ACM, Sammet contacted George Forsythe, president of ACM from 1964 to 1966, who named her Chairperson of the Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation. In order to gain interest in SICSAM, Sammet wrote letters to people she identified through publications and what was happening in the field at that time. She identified people at Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, and IBM who were in different divisions and groups. Sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in ACM. Roughly five years after SICSAM formed, there was a conference about mathematical software called SIGNUM. Sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at SIGNUM because the group was not interested in non-numerical analysis of that kind of an activity. With assistance from those interested in SICSAM, Sammet organized a conference held in March 1966, which was the Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SYMSAM). In June 1966, Tony Oettinger was elected president of ACM and Sammet was elected the Northeast Regional Representative (1966-1968). She was also a member of the ACM Council and ACM lecturer (1967, 1968, and 1972). Bernie Galler was elected president of ACM in 1968 and in August 1968, Sammet became Chairperson of the ACM Committee on SIGs and SICs. In 1971 she was elected chair of SIGPLAN. She served one year of a two-year term before resigning because she was elected vice president of ACM in 1972. As chairperson of SIGPLAN, she organized conferences between SIGPLAN and various Special Interest Groups. Sammet has stated that these conferences were organized based on the recognition of how fundamental programming languages were to different aspects within computing. Sammet served as vice president of ACM from June 1972 to June 1974. Working with the president of ACM at the time, Tony Ralston, Sammet made the finances of ACM a priority. At the time of her vice presidency, ACM was almost bankrupt. Sammet convinced Ralston to hold a member-office forum prior to their annual conference. Sammet encouraged this based on her recognition that ACM had no realistic way of communicating with the membership. Death Sammet died on May 20, 2017 in Silver Spring, Maryland after a brief illness.

It is generally accepted that references to Rav Nachman in the Talmud refer to Rav Nachman bar Yaakov, not to Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak.Tosafot to Gittin 31b takes this position while understanding Rashi as disagreeing. Modern scholarship follows Tosafot, noting that \\"Rav Nachman\\" and \\"Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak\\" are often stated as disagreeing within a single passage. Biography He was a student of Samuel of Nehardea and Rabbah bar Abuha. He served as chief justice of the Jews who were subject to the exilarch (the political head of the Babylonian Jewish community), and was also head of the school of Nehardea. On the destruction of that town, he transferred his pupils to Shekan·∫ìib. His marriage with the daughter of the wealthy exilarchHullin 124a; however, some interpret the Talmudic phrase \\"son-in-law of the house of the prince\\" as referring to a marriage with the exilarch's family and not specifically with his daughter enabled him to live in luxury and to entertain scholars and strangers lavishly. Thus Rabbi Isaac of Palestine, who visited Babylon, stayed at Rav Nachman's house and enjoyed his hospitality. When the guest, upon leaving, was asked by his host to bless him, the former answered with the beautiful parable of the tree which sheltered the weary traveler beneath its shade and fed him with its fruit, so that the grateful wanderer blessed it with the words, \\"How can I bless you? If I say that your fruit should be sweet, they are already sweet; that your shade should be pleasant, it is already pleasant; that the aqueduct should pass below you, it already passes below you. Rather, may all the saplings which are planted for you be like you.\\" Similarly, Rav Nachman already possessed Torah, wealth, and children; so Rav Yitzchak blessed him that his offspring also be like him.Ta'anit 5b-6a Rav Nachman had such a sense of his own worth that he said: \\"If some one now living were to become the Messiah, he must resemble me.\\"Sanhedrin 98b He also permitted himself, in his capacity of justice, to decide civil cases without consulting his colleagues.Sanhedrin 5a When rabbis whom he considered inferior in learning opposed his rulings, he did not hesitate to label them as \\"children\\".Bava Metzia 66a  Teachings  He was the source of a number of important halakhic principles. For example, he was the author of the ruling that a defendant who absolutely denies his guilt must take the so-called rabbinical oath \\"shevu'at hesset\\".Shevuot 40b He also formulated the accepted understanding of avad inish dina lenafsheih (\\"a man may carry out judgment for himself\\"), according to which in certain monetary cases, a person may \\"take the law into his hands\\" and do certain actions to protect his property at the expense of another's, even before a court has ruled on the matter.Bava Kamma 27b Rav Nachman used many collections of aggadot.Berakhot 23b He was fond of collecting in one passage a number of Aramaic aphorisms,see Yoma 28b-29a and used sturdy popular expressions in his speech.Chullin 12a, 172a; Ta'anit 24a His aggadic remarks relating to Biblical personages were likewise made in this style, as the following specimens show: *It is not seemly for women to be conceited; the two prophetesses Deborah and Huldah had hateful names, namely, 'bee' and 'weasel'.Megillah 14b *Impudence is effective even towards Heaven; for initially it is written [that God told Balaam] \\"You shall not go with them\\", and later [after Balaam persisted in asking] it is written [that God said] \\"Rise up and go with them\\".Sanhedrin 105a. *Sinful fancies are more injurious to man than the sin itself.Yoma 28b‚Äì29a References * It has the following bibliography: *Hamburger, R.B.T. ii.819 et seq.; *Bacher, Ag.

Schwartz, a.k.a. Gridlock Sam, is an American transportation engineer, formerly the New York City Traffic Commissioner, notable for popularizing the phrase \\"gridlock\\". Life and career Though he was educated at Brooklyn College (BS Physics) and the University of Pennsylvania (MSCE), he first worked as a New York City cabbie before being hired by the City of New York in 1971. He served as NYC Traffic Commissioner from 1982 to 1986, and when the traffic department became subsumed by the Department of Transportation he held the second-in-command post of First Deputy Commissioner and Chief Engineer from 1986-1990. While employed with the city, he attempted to introduce bicycle lanes and public plazas. They were vetoed at the last minute by then mayor John Lindsay. He earned the nickname Gridlock Sam during the 1980 transit strike when he developed a series of transportation contingency plans, called the \\"Grid-Lock Prevention Program\\" It was under Schwartz's watch that the city almost became the first city to implement congestion pricing. The city's bridges had no been tolled since 1911 and beginning in 1973 he worked with Mayor Lindsay to reintroduce them. Even with a change in leadership (Mayor Lindsay was replaced by Abe Beame in 1974) it looked like the tolls would be reinstated. However, an act of congress nixed the proposal in 1977. See: Congestion pricing in New York City. After he left the City around 1996, he started his own firm.

It is situated to the south-east of Earl Shilton, near to Hinckley on the A47 road. In 2004, the parish had an estimated population of 520, reducing to 509 at the 2011 census.  History  St Mary's Church Elmesthorpe, showing the ruined and restored halves The village has been inhabited from at least Roman times as there is evidence of Roman occupation within the parish. In 1297, Elmesthorpe was home to numerous farms and 40-50 families. The Plague and a failing economy caused the village to depopulate and finally disappear. In 1485, it is thought King Richard III and his troops stayed in the partially ruined church for shelter on their march from Leicester to the Battle of Bosworth; with the king and his officers sheltering within the church, and the soldiers camping outside. Inside the ruined section of Elmesthorpe Church The parish church is dedicated to Saint Mary and was built in the 13th century. It had \\"long been in ruins\\" by the mid 19th century, but the tower was still standing. In 1869 the church was partially rebuilt, in a smaller scale, within the ruins of the church. This, the present church, occupies the east-end of the church and is accessed through the Tower and west end of the church, which have been left as ruins. The village's population had begun a slow recovery by 1710, at which point 40 people were recorded as living in the village. In 1863 Elmesthorpe gained its own railway station on the South Leicestershire Railway. The \\"new village\\" grew up around this station; starting with workers' cottages and an inn built by The Earl of Lovelace, with designs by architect C.F.A. Voysey. In 1871, The Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Elmsthorpe as: > \\"...a parish in Hinckley district, Leicester; on the Leicester and Nuneaton > railway, 3 miles NE by E of Hinckley. It has a station on the railway; and > its post town is Hinckley. Acres, 1,650. Real property, ¬£1,446. Pop., 45. > Houses, 5. The living is a rectory, united with the p. curacy of Earl- > Shilton, in the diocese of Peterborough. The church was used as the > headquarters of Richard's army previous to the battle of Bosworth; and is > now in ruins.\\" In the 1920s a boot and shoe manufacturers opened in the village, called \\"Harvey, Harvey & Company\\". In the 1930s, the government started to address the population of Elmesthorpe, which had not recovered from its collapse in the 13th century. The government initiated a scheme which brought families from depressed areas to make a living from the land. In 1935 Church Farm was purchased by the Land Settlement Association, who built 43 smallholdings in the village. This continued to the 1960s, when the scheme ended. Many of the smallholdings were then purchased by their tenants. The 1960s saw both the railway station and the shoe factory close.

The Gurney flap (or wickerbill) is a small tab projecting from the trailing edge of a wing. Typically it is set at a right angle to the pressure-side surface of the airfoil and projects 1% to 2% of the wing chord. This trailing edge device can improve the performance of a simple airfoil to nearly the same level as a complex high-performance design. The device operates by increasing pressure on the pressure side, decreasing pressure on the suction side, and helping the boundary layer flow stay attached all the way to the trailing edge on the suction side of the airfoil. Common applications occur in auto racing, helicopter horizontal stabilizers, and aircraft where high lift is essential, such as banner-towing airplanes. It is named for its inventor and developer, American race car driver Dan Gurney. History The \\"variable-lift airfoil\\" shown in Figure 1 of the 1935 E. F. Zaparka patent . It is a movable microflap, similar to the fixed Gurney flap. A Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the rear wing of a Porsche 962 The original application, pioneered by American automobile racing icon Dan Gurney (who was challenged to do so by fellow American racer Bobby Unser), was a right-angle piece of sheet metal, rigidly fixed to the top trailing edge of the rear wing on his open-wheel racing cars of the early 1970s. The device was installed pointing upward to increase downforce generated by the wing, improving traction. He field-tested it and found that it allowed a car to negotiate turns at higher speed, while also achieving higher speed in the straight sections of the track. The first application of the flap was in 1971, after Gurney retired from driving and began managing his own racing team full- time. His driver Bobby Unser had been testing a new Gurney-designed car at Phoenix International Raceway and was unhappy with the car's performance on the track. Gurney needed to do something to restore his driver's confidence before the race and recalled experiments conducted in the 1950s by certain racing teams with spoilers affixed to the rear of the bodywork to cancel lift (at that level of development, the spoilers were not thought of as potential performance enhancers, merely devices to cancel out destabilizing and potentially deadly aerodynamic lift). Gurney decided to try adding a \\"spoiler\\" to the top trailing edge of the rear wing. The device was fabricated and fitted in under an hour, but Unser's test laps with the modified wing turned in equally poor times. When Unser was able to speak to Gurney in confidence, he disclosed that the lap times with the new wing were slowed because it was now producing so much downforce that the car was understeering. All that was needed was to balance this by adding downforce in front. Unser realized the value of this breakthrough immediately and wanted to conceal it from the competition, including his brother Al. Not wanting to call attention to the devices, Gurney left them out in the open. To conceal his true intent, Gurney deceived inquisitive competitors by telling them the blunted trailing edge was intended to prevent injury and damage when pushing the car by hand. Some copied the design and some of them even attempted to improve upon it by pointing the flap downward, which actually hurt performance. Gurney was able to use the device in racing for several years before its true purpose became known. Later, he discussed his ideas with aerodynamicist and wing designer Bob Liebeck of Douglas Aircraft Company. Liebeck tested the device, which he later named the \\"Gurney flap\\" and confirmed Gurney‚Äôs field test results using a 1.25% chord flap on a Newman symmetric airfoil. His 1976 AIAA paper (76-406) \\"On the design of subsonic airfoils for high lift\\" introduced the concept to the aerodynamics community. Gurney assigned his patent rights to Douglas Aircraft, but the device was not patentable, since it was substantially similar to a movable microflap patented by E. F. Zaparka in 1931, ten days before Gurney was born. Similar devices were also tested by Gruschwitz and Schrenk and presented in Berlin in 1932. Theory of operation The Gurney flap increases the maximum lift coefficient (CL,max), decreases the angle of attack for zero lift (Œ±0), and increases the nosedown pitching moment (CM), which is consistent with an increase in camber of the airfoil. It also typically increases the drag coefficient (Cd), especially at low angles of attack, although for thick airfoils, a reduction in drag has been reported. A net benefit in overall lift-to-drag ratio is possible if the flap is sized appropriately, based on the boundary layer thickness. The Gurney flap increases lift by altering the Kutta condition at the trailing edge. The wake behind the flap is a pair of counter-rotating vortices that are alternately shed in a von K√°rm√°n vortex street. In addition to these spanwise vortices shed behind the flap, chordwise vortices shed from in front of the flap become important at high angles of attack. The increased pressure on the lower surface ahead of the flap means the upper surface suction can be reduced while producing the same lift. Helicopter applications Double Gurney flaps on a Bell 222U helicopter Gurney flaps have found wide application on helicopter horizontal stabilizers, because they operate over a very wide range of both positive and negative angles of attack. At one extreme, in a high-powered climb, the negative angle of attack of the horizontal stabilizer can be as high as ‚àí25¬∞; at the other extreme, in autorotation, it may be +15¬∞. As a result, at least half of all modern helicopters built in the West have them in one form or another. The Gurney flap was first applied to the Sikorsky S-76B variant, when flight testing revealed the horizontal stabilizer from the original S-76 not providing sufficient lift. Engineers fitted a Gurney flap to the NACA 2412 inverted airfoil to resolve the problem without redesigning the stabilizer from scratch. A Gurney flap was also fitted to the Bell JetRanger to correct an angle of incidence problem in the design that was too difficult to correct directly. The Eurocopter AS355 TwinStar helicopter uses a double Gurney flap that projects from both surfaces of the vertical stabilizer. This is used to correct a problem with lift reversal in thick airfoil sections at low angles of attack. The double gurney flap reduces the control input required to make the transition from hover to forward flight.

He served for a time as Governor of Newfoundland and Comptroller of the Navy. Naval career Falkingham received his first commission in 1703 when he was promoted to lieutenant. On 26 February 1713 he was promoted to the rank of captain in command of HMS Weymouth. Falkingham in charge of HMS Gibraltar, along with Commodore Thomas Kempthorne aboard of HMS Worcester, was charged with overseeing the enforcement of Treaty of Utrecht when it came to the fishing grounds of Newfoundland in 1715. A major concern to the merchants of England was the over-wintering of fisherman in Newfoundland and William Arnold, a New England trader, was suspecting of enticing those fisherman to over-winter in New England. Falkingham was assigned the duty of observing Arnold in the summer of 1715. Falkingham went on to command various vessels in both the Baltic and the Mediterranean. In 1718 he commanded HMS Orford with distinction at the Battle of Cape Passaro, off the coast of Sicily. On 5 May 1732, Falkingham was commissioned as Commodore-Governor of Newfoundland. Finding that there was only one prison, in St John's, Falkingham ordered the construction of other prisons in Ferryland, Bonavista and Carbonear. Falkingham retired from sea service in 1742 after which he was appointed resident commissioner of the navy at Port Mahon Dockyard on behalf of the Navy Board until 1744. In 1745 he was appointed Commissioner of the Navy at Woolwich Dockyard until 1746. In February 1755 he was appointed Comptroller of the Navy at the Navy Board; he held the post until November 1755. When his health began to fail him at the end 1755 he retired from the Navy altogether.

It is the easternmost village in the district, and is 6 miles south east of Leicester. Nearby places are Fleckney, Arnesby, Wistow and Kilby Bridge. In the 1870s Kilby was described as \\"KILBY, a parish, with a village, in Blaby district, Leicestershire; on a branch of the river Soar, and on the Union canal, 2 miles SSE of Wigston railway station, and 6¬Ω SSE of Leicester. Post town, Wigston, under Leicester. Acres, 1,060. Real property, ¬£2,200.Population, 362. Houses, 95.\\" History Kilby has had the origins of its name possibly traced back to a Scandinavian form of Old English, being translated to 'children's farm/settlement.' Kilby was mentioned in the Domesday book where it was said to have been originally formed around the parish Church of St. Mary Magdalene. In the Domesday book of 1068 Kilby or Cilebi, as it was spelt, resided in a district called 'Guthlaxton Wapentake' under the ownership of Oger the Breton who was recorded as Tennant-in-chief. Kilby was recorded as having \\"28 households, containing 9 villagers, 7 smallholders, 2 slaves and 10 freemen.\\" Kilby was also reported as having a Meadow consisting of 12 acres and 1 mill. Prior to the Domesday book the Lord of Kilby was recorded as Eur who resided as Lord during 1066. Total Population of Kilby parish in Leicestershire as reported by the census population 1811-2011 The parish Church is now located around a quarter of a mile away from the centre of modern-day Kilby. The original parish Church finished construction in 1220, however this was replaced by the present day parish Church which was consecrated in 1858. Population data for Kilby is available dating back to 1811 which at the time had a total population of 242. This figure is close to the 2011 census report of 270 inhabitants. Kilby reached its peak population, as dictated by census records, in 1831 with 434 inhabitants living in the village. This figure then significantly dropped to 291 in the 1881 census. The population of Kilby has remained has remained fairly consistent from 1881 to 2011. Kilby contains a number of listed buildings such as the Bakehouse, Dog and Gun Public House and Kilby Lodge. Many of the listed buildings date back to at least the 17th century. Boundary changes The boundaries of the parish of Kilby were enlarged in April 1936 when the parish extended to include Foston after the closing of Foston Civil parish. This caused the parish boundaries of Kilby to increase from 1,068 acres to 2,401 acres, an increase of 1,333 acres. To this day the parish of Kilby still includes Foston. During the 19th century it is recorded that Kilby became an independent parish, having been previously in union with Newton Harcourt and Fleckney. It is thought that they had formed the ancient parish sometime in the 13th century. Another boundary change occurred within Kilby during the First World War. This happened due to Lord Cottesloe of Wigston selling 50 acres of smallholdings to Leicestershire County Council, which were in turn given to ex-servicemen from Kilby who had fought in the First World War. Occupational statistics Occupational employment for Kilby as reported by the 1881 census report Industrial occupational statistics for Kilby are available within the 1881 census. These statistics show that the main employment sector for workers in Kilby in 1881 was agriculture with 30.1% of the population involved. The industrial statistics also show that there was no significant divide in the number of men and women employed in occupational sectors. Male workers made up 50.9% of the total number of workers while women consisted of 49.1%. However, there was a significant divide in the number of men and women employed in the agricultural occupational sector. Within the agricultural workforce 97.87% of the workers were male while 2.13% of the workers were female. Kilby Occupational Sector Graph, 2011 Modern day Kilby has seen a shift in the distribution of those involved in occupational employment as compared to the 1881 census report. The 2011 census statistics showed that the most popular occupational employment sector in Kilby was the wholesale and retail trade and the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles with 15.9% of the working population involved. This has changed from the 1881 census statistic of agriculture being the most prominent form of employment in Kilby with 30.1% of the working population being engaged in agriculture. Whereas in modern-day Kilby only 9.7% of the population is employed in agriculture,a difference of 20.4%. The agricultural occupational sector began to nationally decline in the first half of the 20th century due to the industrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture. The agricultural sector was replaced by service industries as the major employment sector across England. This national trend can be seen within the industrial statistics available for Kilby where the prominent employment sector in 2011 was a service industry. The total number of persons employed in occupational sectors has decreased between 1881 and 2011. In 1881 the total number of people in employment was 152. This is greater than the 144 persons in employment sectors in Kilby in 2011. In 2011 the working population was smaller than 1881 even though the overall population of Kilby was greater than 1881. This can be attributed to children leaving school at a younger age in the 19th century to go to work, as opposed to the 21st century. Present day Kilby has only one pub called the Dog & Gun, an Anglican Primary School and a Parish Church. There is also a park for the residents of Kilby. The park has a small football field, swings, a roundabout, climbing obstacles and a picnic table. There is also a small elderly community. Kilby is located near the River Sense. Kilby had a population of 270 according to the 2011 census. Arriva Midlands operate service 49 through Kilby providing a regular bus service into Wigston Magna and Leicester. Education Kilby contains one school called Kilby St Mary's Church of England Primary school which educates children from age 4 to age 11. The school came into existence in the 1850s which is currently a listed building. As of September 2011 the current headteacher of the primary school is Ms Phillipa Denny. Secondary education pupils in Kilby have to travel to nearby Wigston for schooling. The two closest secondary schools to Kilby are Wigston Birkett House Community Special School and The Beauchamp College. These schools are located 2.3 and 2.4 miles away from the village respectively. Places of interest Kilby Wood is a woodland comprising 12.5 acres located to the South of Kilby.

The abbey church was dedicated to Saint Mary. The site was originally occupied by an almshouse for the poor, and was founded by the Augustinians as a priory in the 12th century. Voluntary grants of alms by the leading families of Nerford and Creake and by the faithful of the neighbourhood seem to have built up resources sufficiently to warrant elevation from Hospital to Priory and thence to Abbey, which happened in 1231. Henry III made a number of grants to Creake in its early years. Gifts of parish churches included Hapton and Wreningham, Gateley and St Martin at Quarles and later in 1365 of St Andrew, Great Ringstead. The heyday of the Abbey was during the fourteenth century when there were but six canons, though the Rule required in addition to the abbot, prior and cellarer, a cantor, sacrist and kitchener, refectorian, infirmarian, almoner, master of novices and guest master. According to Bedingfield, these posts may have been filled in rotation or plurality. There will have been junior canons and, from time to time, novices. There would finally be numerous servants, tailors, laundresses and their assistants, the messor, shepherds and cowherds for the farm, as well as residents of the hospital. Unlike some of the abbeys in the region, it was still fulfilling its hospital function as late as 1397. In 1483, a fire swept through the abbey, damaging the church and several of the other buildings, such that it was beyond the capacity of the convent to restore it. The abbot appealed to the king as patron of the house, and Richard III, 'moved with pite' gave the abbey by way of alms towards the rebuilding of the handsome sum of ¬£46 13s.4d., to be paid out the revenues of the lordship of Fakenham. Robert Walsingham, appointed abbot in 1491, began extensive rebuilding of the quire and presbytery, and Sir William Calthorpe left ¬£74 towards the completion of the work. By 1503 the work was well advanced and lands given by Walter Aslake were used for the completion of the north side of the quire. By this time the abbot was Giles Sherington. However, in 1506 an outbreak of the 'sweating sickness' wiped out the monastic community, the abbot himself being the last to die. The abbey site and estate was given to Lady Margaret Beaufort in 1507, and ended up in the ownership of Christ's College, Cambridge. A few sections of the church walls remain standing, and demonstrate their traditional Norfolk flintwork. There are some remaining carved details in the window arches and doorways. However, little else survives apart from foundations. The site is now in the care of English Heritage, and freely accessible to the public. References * The Heritage Trail (1998‚Äì2005).

Early life Duveneck was born in Covington, Kentucky, the son of German immigrant Bernhard Decker. Decker died in a cholera epidemic when Frank was only a year old and his widow remarried Joseph Duveneck. By the age of fifteen Frank had begun the study of art under the tutelage of a local painter, Johann Schmitt, and had been apprenticed to a German firm of church decorators. While having grown up in Covington, Duveneck was a part of the German community in Cincinnati, Ohio, just across the Ohio River. However, due to his Catholic beliefs and German heritage, he was an outsider as far as the artistic community of Cincinnati was concerned. Career In 1869, he went abroad to study with Wilhelm von Diez and Wilhelm Leibl at the Royal Academy of Munich, where he learned a dark, realistic and direct style of painting. He subsequently became one of the young American painters‚Äîothers were William Merritt Chase, John Henry Twachtman, Willis Seaver Adams and Walter Shirlaw‚Äîwho in the 1870s overturned the traditions of the Hudson River School and started a new art movement characterized by a greater freedom of paint application. =Success= Portrait of Maggie Wilson (1898), oil on board, 38.10 x 30.48 cm, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, USA His work, at first ignored in Covington, attracted great attention when shown at the Boston Art Club in 1875, and pupils flocked to him in Germany and Italy, where he made long visits. Henry James called him \\"the unsuspected genius\\" and at the age of 27 he was a celebrated artist. In 1878, Duveneck opened a school in Munich, and in the village of Polling in Bavaria. His students, known as the \\"Duveneck Boys\\", included John Twachtman, Otto Henry Bacher, Julius Rolshoven, and John White Alexander.Biography, Smithsonian Archives of American Art Following the death of his wife in March 1888, he returned to America from Italy and gave some attention to sculpture, and modelled a fine monument to his wife, now in the Cimitero Evangelico agli Allori in Florence. Despite this activity, Elizabeth's death marked a slowing in his productivity; a wealthy man, he chose to lead a life of relative obscurity. He lived in Covington until his death in 1919 and taught at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, where some pupils of note were Cornelia Cassady Davis, Ida Holterhoff Holloway, John Christen Johansen, M. Jean McLane, Edward Charles Volkert, Russel Wright, Charles Mills, and Herman and Bessie Wessel. Among his most famous paintings are Lady with Fan (1873) and The Whistling Boy (1872), both of which reveal Duveneck's debt to the dark palette and slashing brushwork of Frans Hals. His work can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Richmond Art Museum, the Hyde Collection in Glen's Falls, NY, the Kenton County Library in Covington, Ky, and the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption, also in Covington and the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center in Poughkeepsie, NY. A portrait, Young Man with Tousled Hair (the Street Urchin), now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, was previously in the collection of Kurt Vonnegut. In 1905, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1906. Personal life On March 25, 1886, Duveneck married one of his students who was much admired by Henry James, Boston-born Elizabeth Boott. The two had been engaged off and on since 1881. They lived in Villa Castellani in Florence (where she had been raised) for two years. Together, they were the parents of a son, Frank Boott Duveneck. She died in Paris of pneumonia and, reportedly, Duveneck was devastated. Later, Duveneck often spent summers in Gloucester, Massachusetts visiting his son and painting en plein air. After his death in Cincinnati, Ohio on January 3, 1919, Duveneck was buried at the Mother of God Cemetery, in Covington. A life-size bronze statue depicting Duveneck holding a plaque with his wife's picture on it stands in a small park at the intersection of Pike and Washington streets in Covington, Kentucky.

Parry started diving in the 1940s as a young girl. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1933, she was raised on a Wisconsin lake and learned to swim and love the water at an early age. As a young woman, while working in Santa Monica, California, for the Douglas Aircraft Company, she became involved in pioneering diving and scientific work Sports Illustrated magazine. In 1953 she became a tester of underwater equipment for Scientific Underwater Research Enterprises. Later, she and her partner, (Parry Bivens, an aeronautical and aquatic engineer) designed, built, and marketed the first civilian hyperbaric chamber for divers. They were evangelists for the purchase of hyperbaric chambers around the world to provide lifesaving facilities for divers suffering from \\"the bends\\". In 1954, Parry set a women's depth record to 209 feet. She is said to have stopped at 209 feet when she reached the bottom. That year, she became the third female instructor to graduate from the L.A. County UICC program. Later in 1954, Parry made her screen debut in Kingdom of the Sea, a Jack Douglas Production, which was shown in 70 countries and had a successful run of several years. Because of her work in Kingdom of the Sea, Parry was tapped by the producers of the new show, Sea Hunt. Parry has referred to Sea Hunt as an \\"underwater western\\". The lead character, Mike Nelson (played by Lloyd Bridges), was introduced to an undersea problem or villain at the start of the show. By the end of the half-hour, he had resolved the problem. Parry's beauty and her knowledge of the sea and diving made her a natural to join the Sea Hunt show. She was cast without a single screen test. Her role in the series was primarily as a female underwater stunt double, but she did appear as an actress in a few episodes. She also assisted in teaching Mr. Bridges how to use scuba gear prior to the series going into production. Parry's acting continued on other shows, including GE Theatre, Wagon Train, Peter Gunn, The Magic Circus, and more. Parry continued as an actor for a number of years including many commercials and as a stunt woman on a wide variety of shows involving underwater scenes. Most recently, she was in the film Tillamook Treasure, in which she played Sam, the owner of a hardware store. Parry's experience goes beyond diving and acting. She is an accomplished photographer and writer. She has used her organizational skills to bring the beauty of underwater photography to the public. In 1957, Parry co-founded the International Underwater Film Festival that ran for 17 years. In 1960, she became the first elected woman president of the U/W Photographic Society. She wrote and published a book with the late Albert Tillman, Scuba America Vol. I, the Human History of Sport Diving in America. The book is now also available as an eBook. She was on the cover of the May 23, 1955 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine. Parry received the NOGI Award for Distinguished Service, DEMAs Reaching Out Award, the Women's Scuba Association Scuba Diver of the Year Award, and the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Education Award. In 2001, Parry was made a \\"Lifetime Ambassador at Large\\", by The Academy of Underwater Arts and Sciences. In 2002, she was inducted into the Cayman Island International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame and received the Beneath the Sea Diver of the Year Award. Parry has been an ardent supporter of The Women Divers Hall of Fame (WDHOF) since its inception in 1999.

It cuts through the Valparaiso and Tinley Moraines, crossing the Saint Lawrence River Divide that separates the Great Lakes and Gulf of St. Lawrence watersheds from the Gulf of Mexico watershed, making it one of the most strategic points in the interior of the North American continent. The saddle point of the gap is within the city of Chicago, and the Chicago Portage is a reason Chicago exists and developed to become an important city. Flow direction A principal feature of the Chicago Portage water gap is that water can flow through it in either direction across the Saint Lawrence River Divide. It has flowed from east to west, west to east, or not at all. There have been two long-term reversals, and short-term reversals still happen today. Initially, water flowed from east to west starting about 10,000 years ago. About 3,000 years ago, this flow mostly stopped, and the Chicago Portage became a wind gap, except during floods when it flowed from west to east. In the year 1900, it was reversed to again flow continuously from east to west, except during floods when it can be reversed to flow from west to east. History Development of the Great Lakes Map of Chicago Portage The Chicago Portage was formed as the Wisconsin glaciation retreated northward about 10,000 years ago, leaving behind Lake Chicago consisting of its meltwater. Lake Chicago found its only outlet at its southwestern edge, where it overflowed the Valparaiso Moraine which encircles the southern half of the Lake Chicago/Lake Michigan basin, creating the Chicago Outlet River. This was a substantial river, carving the channel later used by the main and south branches of the Chicago River, and the Des Plaines River. Eventually the glaciers melted far enough northward that Lake Chicago was connected to Lake Huron, a combination sometimes called Lake Michigan- Huron, resulting in a significant drop in the water level. Until perhaps 3,000 years ago, the combined lakes had two outlets, one at Chicago, and the other via the St. Clair River at Port Huron, Michigan. Eventually the St. Clair River outlet eroded slightly more quickly, resulting in stream capture of the Chicago Outlet River as the water level of Lake Michigan-Huron gradually declined. However, until man-made canals and levees were built within the past 170 years, during periods of heavy rain or downstream ice dams, the Des Plaines River could still flood eastward through a marshy area of the bed of the former Chicago Outlet River known as Mud Lake, across the continental divide into the Chicago River and then into Lake Michigan. The saddle point of the gap, where the continental divide crossed the water course, was historically at the eastern end of Mud Lake, where Native Americans portaging their canoes across the low point of the divide carved a slight gouge. This location is now 3100 West 31st Street in Chicago. However, the alterations reversing the flow of the Chicago River in 1900 moved the continental divide to pass through the heart of Downtown Chicago, and moved the saddle point to the Chicago Locks at the mouth of the Chicago River on the Lake Michigan shore. When heavy rain causes the Chicago River to flood, the Chicago Locks can still be opened to release floodwater across the continental divide into Lake Michigan, similar to the historic Des Plaines River floods through Mud Lake across the divide. As the first Americans extended their settlement northward following the retreating glaciers, they found the Chicago Portage to be a convenient transportation route between the shores of Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River in the interior. The portage was revealed to Europeans in 1673 when the French explorers, Louis Joliet (Jolliet) and Father Jacques Marquette, were canoeing upstream on the Mississippi River. They were guided to the portage by local Native Americans and continued along the Illinois and Des Plaines Rivers. Near where the Des Plaines was separated from the Chicago River they encountered a swampy area known as Mud Lake. Seasonally, this was a shallow waterway or a muddy slough of . This connected the Des Plaines to the Chicago River, which then flowed into Lake Michigan. When French explorer Robert de La Salle surveyed the strategic importance of this connection, he is said to have stood at that point on the shore of Lake Michigan and stated, \\"This will be the gate of empire, this the seat of commerce.\\"Chicago Today and Tomorrow, by William Joseph Showalter, Nationional Gerographic Magazine, January 1, 1919 flag of the city of Chicago , adopted in 1917, includes two blue stripes symbolizing the waters that meet at the city. In the 18th century, the Chicago Portage was the most strategic location in the interior of the North American continent and in particular between the French cities of Montreal and New Orleans. Control of the Portage was critical if the French were to contain English expansion in the New World. According to Joliet, a canal of \\"half a league' (about ) across the Chicago Portage would allow easy navigation from Lake Erie to the Gulf of Mexico. In 1848, the Illinois and Michigan Canal was opened, breaching the water divide and enabling navigation between the two waterways. In 1900 it was replaced by the larger Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. After the Chicago River was reversed and diverted to the new canal, the Mississippi watershed is now separated from the Great Lakes by only the Chicago Locks. The quantity of water allowed to pass (and thus diverted from the St. Lawrence River) is regulated by the U.S. and Canadian International Joint Commission. Mud Lake From about 3,000 years ago until the year 1900, the Des Plaines River and the Chicago River were connected in the ancient stream bed of the Chicago Outlet River by a slough or swampy area known as Mud Lake. This remnant was left behind when the water level of Lake Michigan-Huron dropped as the St. Clair River captured the flow of the Chicago Outlet River. Mud Lake could be wet, dry, marshy, or frozen, depending on the season and the weather, making it a difficult, albeit very valuable, transportation route. It was drained in several stages, starting with the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1848, which bisected it. Several other attempts were made to drain Mud Lake, with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal finally accomplishing this in 1900. A small remnant of Mud Lake still exists as a wetland area in Forest View, between the Stevenson Expressway, railroad tracks, and West 51st Street, near the Forest View water tower. This isolated remnant of Mud Lake has been prevented from draining into the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal by the levees of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, the railroad lines, and later the Stevenson Expressway which was built on top of the old I&M; Canal in 1964. The rest of Mud Lake is today covered by industrial areas of the city of Chicago. Chicago Portage National Historic Site The Chicago Portage National Historic Site is a National Historic Site in Lyons, Cook County, Illinois, United States. Preserved within the park is the western end of the historic portage linking the Chicago River to the Des Plaines River, thereby linking the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. The wild onion that gave Chicago its name thrives here. The site is the only part of the historic Chicago Portage that remains in a natural and protected state more or less as it existed when revealed to French explorers Louis Joliet (Jolliet) and Father Jacques Marquette by Native Americans.

Butler was born in Kilkenny, Ireland, son of Michael Butler, farmer, and his wife Mary, n√©e Joyce. He was educated at St Kieran's College intending to become a priest, according to Thomas Carlyle. During the Great Famine he became a journalist and supported Young Ireland as the editor of the Galway Vindicator. Young Ireland attempted to build an Irish national movement that included Catholics and Protestants and campaigned for a common educational system for all denominations. Butler found that his ambitions to be trained as a lawyer were blocked in Ireland because of his Catholicism and he migrated to Sydney, arriving in May 1853, where he found work writing for Henry Parkes' Empire. He was admitted as a barrister in 1855 and was appointed as a crown prosecutor for the metropolitan and coast district in 1857. In 1858 he married Ellen Mary Connolly and they had four sons and five daughters. In politics Butler was a strong supporter of the \\"liberal party\\", associated with Parkes and John Robertson, including Robertson's land policy and Charles Cowper's support for the withdrawal of state aid to religion. From 1869 to 1877 he was the member for Argyle in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and was the 13th Attorney-General of New South Wales from May 1872 to November 1873. He made a major contribution to reducing the level of sectarianism that had been sparked by Henry James O'Farrell's attack on Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh in 1868. Butler's first wife died in 1871 and, in 1875, he married Marion and they had one daughter. He was appointed for life to the Legislative Council in 1877. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1873 and had become a wealthy squatter. He died in Sydney.

Biography Henson was born in Nottingham, England on 3 May 1812.Henson's personal journal, from Henson & Stringfellow, Aeronautical Pioneers, published 1943(?) Original preserved at the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences in the USFreeReg, transcription of baptism record Some sources incorrectly say 1805 Henson was involved in lace- making in Chard and he obtained a patent on improved lace-making machines in 1835. Henson is best known as an early pioneer in aviation, but patented many other inventions, some of which are in wide use today. In 1849 William Henson and his wife, Sarah, left England and moved to the United States, joining his father and settling in Newark, New Jersey. Henson never did any further aviation research while in the United States and worked as a machinist, civil engineer and inventor.US Census recordsAeronautics, Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society, issue circa 1950 He had 7 children, only 4 of whom lived to adulthood. Henson died on 22 March 1888 in Newark, New Jersey. He and most of his family were buried in Rosedale Cemetery in Orange, New Jersey. Aeronautical inventions Starting c. 1838, Henson became interested in aviation. In April 1841 he patented an improved lightweight steam engine, and with fellow lacemaking-engineer John Stringfellow in c. 1842 he designed a large passenger-carrying steam-powered monoplane, with a wing span of 150 feet, which he named the \\"Henson Aerial Steam Carriage\\". He received a patent on it in 1843 along with Stringfellow. 1843 engraving of the Aerial Steam Carriage Henson, Stringfellow, Frederick Marriott, and D.E. Colombine, incorporated as the Aerial Transit Company in 1843 in England, with the intention of raising money to construct the flying machine. Henson built a scale model of his design, which made one tentative steam-powered \\"hop\\" as it lifted, or bounced, off its guide wire. Attempts were made to fly the small model, and a larger model with a 20-foot wing span, between 1844 and 1847, without success. Henson grew discouraged, married and emigrated in 1849 to the United States, while Stringfellow continued to experiment with aviation. Henson appeared as a character in a fictional newspaper story by Edgar Allan Poe, which recounted a supposed trans-Atlantic balloon trip, in which Henson was one of the passengers on the balloon.Edgar Allan Poe, Balloon Hoax, New York Sun, 1844 Henson and Stringfellow are frequently mentioned in books on the history of aviation.Google book search for William Samuel Henson The Royal Aeronautical Society holds annual \\"Henson-Stringfellow\\" lectures; as of 2008 they have held 52. A glacier in Antarctica is named after him due to his work in aviation (Henson Glacier: 64'06'S, 60'11'WHenson Glacier)). Henson and Stringfellow were referred to in the 1965 film The Flight of the Phoenix. =Aerial Design= The Aerial's wings were rectangular, and were formed by wooden spars covered with fabric, and braced, internally and externally, with wires. The Aerial Steam Carriage was to be powered by two contra-rotating six- bladed propellers mounted in the rear in a push-type system. The design follows earlier \\"birdlike\\" gliders, and the ideas of George Cayley, and Henson corresponded with Cayley in an attempt to obtain funding after the efforts to obtain the support of Parliament and sell stock failed.\\"Henson and StringFellow\\", M. J. B. Davy, 1931 The Aerial Transit Company never built the largest version of the Aerial Steam Carriage because of the failed attempts with the medium-sized model. Henson, Stringfellow, Marriott and Colombine dissolved the company around 1848. =Advertising= The Aerial Transit Company's publicist, Frederick Marriott, commissioned prints in 1843 depicting the Aerial Steam Carriage over the pyramids of Egypt, in India, and over London, England, and other places, which drew considerable interest from the public. The prints have appeared on several stamps of various countries. Marriott later became an aviation pioneer in California. Other inventions and innovations Henson obtained a number of patents in widely varying areas. Major patents include: * Lace-making decoration, 1835 * Lightweight steam engines, 1841 * Flying machine, 1843 * T-handled safety razor, 1847 Henson invented the modern form of the razor, the 'T' shaped safety razor, and patented it in 1847: \\"the cutting blade of which is at right angles with the handle, and resembles somewhat the form of a common hoe.\\"Origins of the Safety Razor While a major improvement on the previous form of safety razor, an additional improvement was needed to make safety razors common. In 1901, Gillette combined Henson's T-shaped safety razor with disposable blades, and produced the modern razor.The Origins of Everyday Things (book) Henson published a pamphlet on astronomy in 1871 suggesting that the solar system formed from cold dust and gas, and discussed how it could condense into meteors and comets, and further condense into planets, moons and the sun, in the process heating up. He also discusses how this would lead to the planets orbiting in the ecliptic and rotating in the same general plane.The Medical Eclectic, 1874 issue, book review of \\"The Great Facts of Modern Astronomy\\" Henson created inventions in other areas as well.

Biography Enneking was born of German ancestry in Minster, Ohio. He was educated at Mount St. Mary's College, Cincinnati, served in the American Civil War in 1861-1862, studied art in New York and Boston, and gave it up because his eyes were weak, only to return to it after failing in the manufacture of tinware. From 1873 to 1876 he studied in Munich under Schleich and Leier, and in Paris under Daubigny and Bonnat; and in 1878-1879 he studied in Paris again and sketched in the Netherlands. Enneking is a plein air painter, and his favorite subject is the November twilight of New England, and more generally the half lights of early spring, late autumn, and winter dawn and evening. Enneking died at Boston in 1916. Shortly after his death, memorial exhibitions of his work were held at the Boston Art Club and in Portland, Maine. These were followed a decade later by two exhibitions at the Vose Galleries of Boston in 1922 and 1926. His family placed the bulk of his work in storage in an old warehouse in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. After the death of his wife Mary Katharine Elliott Enneking (November 2, 1844 ‚Äî October 23 1923), the paintings were forgotten. The paintings were rediscovered in the late 1950s as the warehouse was being torn down. The Vose Galleries in Boston were again involved in promoting his work, and in 1972, in the publication of Enneking's biography.. The Enneking Parkway in Hyde Park, Massachusetts is named after Enneking. References External links Paintings by John J.

The pass was formed by the San Andreas Fault, a major transform fault between the Pacific plate and the North American plate. The tall mountain ranges on either side of the pass result in the pass being a transitional zone from a Mediterranean climate west of the pass, to a Desert climate east of the pass. This also makes the pass area one of the windiest places in the United States, and why it is home to the San Gorgonio Pass wind farm. It serves as a major transportation corridor between the Greater Los Angeles region and the Coachella Valley, and ultimately into Arizona and the United States interior. Both Interstate 10, and the Union Pacific Railroad, utilize the pass. When the rail line was completed in January, 1883, by the Southern Pacific Railroad, it was billed as the second U.S. transcontinental railroad.Lech, pp 249. The pass is one of the deepest mountain passes in the 48 contiguous states, with the mountains to either side rising almost above it. San Gorgonio Mountain, taller but farther away and less visible, is at the northern side of the pass, and Mount San Jacinto is on the southern side. Mount San Jacinto has the fifth-largest rock wall in North America, and its peak is only six miles south of Interstate 10. The pass is also referred to as the Banning Pass due to the town of Banning being located about 6.5 miles east of the pass summit.Banning, CA, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1953 (1988 rev.) The city itself was named for Phineas Banning who founded the town. Geology The pass is the major geologic divide between the igneous batholithic Peninsular Ranges and the Transverse Ranges, which is a massive fault block composed of diverse forms of rock. According to Yule 2009, the pass is the single \\"largest discontinuity along the San Andreas fault\\". One active branch of the San Andreas Fault passes through the San Gorgonio Pass roughly parallel and just to the north of interstate 10. Active parts of the Banning, the Garnet Hill and the San Gorgonio Pass Thrust faults are associated with the San Andreas Fault through the Pass. Together, these faults accommodate strike-slip and reverse slip that contributes to both uplift of the San Bernardino Mountains and overall movement between the North American plate and the Pacific plate. Geography =Climate= The San Gorgonio Pass area tends to get snow at least once or twice during the winter months, although it rarely sticks to hard surfaces, such as the freeway or city streets. =Topography= The San Gorgonio River runs through the pass, west to east, and joins the Whitewater River near the community of Whitewater at the northwest end of Coachella Valley. Transportation The Southern Pacific Railroad (now the Union Pacific) laid down tracks through the pass in 1875. Amtrak's Sunset Limited and Texas Eagle intercity passenger trains continue to run on the line in addition to several freight trains. The summit of the pass is in Beaumont, just east of the junction of Interstate 10 and State Route 79, at an elevation of about . However, the heart of the pass is generally considered to be further east near Cabazon, where the passageway between the two mountain ranges is narrowest. Eastward from here, the route descends steeply towards the Coachella Valley, with the eastern end of the pass taken to be at the junction of Interstate 10 and State Route 111 near Whitewater Canyon. In 1952 an expressway was built through the pass, carrying U.S. Route 99, U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 60\\\\. There are still portions of the old U.S. 99 route between Whitewater Canyon and Cabazon. Main Street in Cabazon, Ramsey Street in Banning, 6th Street in Beaumont, and Roberts Road in Calimesa are all old sections of U.S. 99\\\\.

Teams of five players each must shoot at the goal with a ball within a certain time after gaining possession. History In Tasmania, Water Basketball first started in September 2003 with a demonstration game between two teams made up of Hobart Chargers, Hobart Hurricanes, Tassie Devils football team and the Tassie Tigers cricket team. The sport has been further developed by The Hobart Aquatic Centre to allow for a more recreational and mixed approach to the game. It involves two teams of six players (of which at least three are female) on field (with a maximum of four additional substitutes), who pass the ball down the pool to their goal end, which is a hoop similar to basketball. In 2005, the Italian Federation of Basketball recognized it as a form of basketball. In the Netherlands, people have been playing water basketball (known there as waterbasketbal) since the 1970s. In the Netherlands it was played by people with a handicap. Besides regular tournaments, they also organize a national championship where the best teams compete for the official Dutch Waterbasketbal championship title. In Slovenia a version of water basketball developed in 1997. Till that time there were played two versions of water basketball. In first one there was a classical basket fixed at edge of the swimming pool. This was not very convenient because player were kicked on the wall of swimming pool and basket was to high for realization of some attractive actions. The second version was using a floating basket, making it very difficult to throw the ball in the basket. Toma≈æ Slavec and Matja≈æ Kodek from Kranj, Slovenia developed a special basket (long pillar sunk in the water, with basket on the end at one meter over water level), the ball, and made new playing rules. All disadvantages of the previously described version of water basketball were removed. There is no wall and floating basket problem, the game became very dynamic (as with hockey) because it could be played behind the basket. This game is also played in P√©cs and Budapest, Hungary.

It is situated north-east of Leicester, nearer to the villages of Keyham and Hungarton in the neighbouring district of Harborough and lies along the Barkby Brook. This small rural hamlet can be succinctly described as \\"a series of scattered houses that remain of the shrunken medieval village\\". The parish also includes the hamlet of Little Beeby, which consists of several houses within the settlement and is located 200m south east of the All Saints Church. History The villages name is of Anglo-Saxon origin. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the place name was recorded as \\"Bebi\\" and derives from the Olde English pre 7th Century \\"beo\\", meaning bee, plus the Old Norse \\"byr\\", a settlement or village; hence, \\"bee settlement\\". In the 1870s John Marius Wilson described Beeby in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales as: :\\"a parish in Barrow-upon-Soar district, Leicester; on an affluent of the river Wreak, 4 miles SE of Syston r. station, and 5¬Ω NE of Leicester. Post Town, Hungarton, under Leicester. Acres, 1,020. Real property, ¬£2,620. Pop., 119. Houses, 26. The property is divided among a few. Beeby House is a chief residence. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Peterborough. Value, ¬£282.* Patron, Earl Shaftesbury. The church is good.\\" The Parish registers of Beeby commence in 1540, one of the oldest in the county. There was no mention, however, of the name Beeby in the register, as at this time you would only adopt the name 'Beeby' if you were a property or land owner. Many of the buildings in the village date back to the eighteenth and nineteenth century, mostly designed with Georgian and Victorian periods of architecture indicated by its structure materials. There is no known ancient architectural potential in Beeby, however, within the fields surrounding the conservation area there is underlying archaeological interest where there is evidence of a larger medieval settlement. According to a census report in 1801 there were 25 houses in Beeby, which has risen by only 3 in the following 200 years. At present, many of the 28 buildings in Beeby are grade listed and sell between the prices of ¬£150,000 for small cottages up to ¬£700,000 for the Georgian and Victorian country houses. The village of Beeby is referenced in Adrian Mole & the Weapons of Mass Destruction as the home of the Flowers family.Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Demographics =Population= Total Population of Beeby Civil Parish, Leicestershire, as reported by the Census of Population from 1881 to 2011 The population of Beeby has always been very small and has changed very little since the Domesday survey in 1098. According to a population census in 1801 it was home to 124 people which rose to 139 in 1851 (the highest recorded since the first population census). This number then fell to 95 in 1991 (the lowest recorded). Population records date back to the 14th century to show there were 96 inhabitants at the time of the Poll Tax in 1377 and a population of 86 at the time of the Ecclesiastical census in 1676. At present Beeby has a population of 115 (60 males and 55 females) 16 of which are children. Occupational employment for Beeby, Leicestershire, as reported by the 1881 census report =Occupational statistics= The Domesday book census taken in 1086 indicates that there were 21 villains ('peasants', bound to the Lord of the Manor), 5 Sokemen (freemen enjoying extensive rights over land) and 2 servants. The first census in 1801 simply divided people into those involved in agriculture and those in trade and manufacturing. It was only in the 1841 census that first gathered occupational data. According to occupation data reports published in 1881, of Beeby's 108 inhabitants, the majority of males worked in agriculture and females in domestic service. The children of this parish would have attended school in Barkby's Public Elementary School, about 2 miles to the west of Beeby and still do in the present day. Many of Beeby's residents at present work in agriculture and retail, commuting to Leicester for work. The nearest train stations to Beeby are Syston (3.19 miles away) or Leicester (5.09 miles away). Nearby food sources include Picks Organic Farmer & Grower Farm Shop, Gamble and Hollis Butchers, with the large supermarket chains located in Leicester. Geography =Topography= Beeby, Leicestershire The physical and historical development of the hamlet has been strongly influenced by the local topography and its relative isolation. Beeby is situated within an established agricultural landscape largely in pastoral use. Until 1904 the east-west route was the only route through the hamlet, which was referred to as the Main Road or Barkby Road, connecting the village to Barkby (neighbouring village) and South Croxton. The other roads that now run through Beeby are Hungarton Road, situated to the east and Scraptoft Road, to the south giving the village a more direct link to the outskirts of Leicester. This isolation has mitigated the villages growth over time. This as well as several clusters of cottages and Brewery cottages mixed with informal and open grouping of farmhouses and their associating buildings are features which give this isolated village its character and appeal. =Conservation Area= The Conservation Area was designated in September 1975 and it covers an area of around 6.4 ha (15.8 acres) of gradually sloping land either side of a small tributary stream to the Barkby Brook. This extends along the Main Street and to Barkby Road and essentially relates to the physical extent of the settlement as it was at the end of the nineteenth century. The conservation area is protected by the Regional Spatial Strategy for the East Midlands (RSS) which advises local authorities to develop strategies that avoid damage to the region's cultural assets. Historic sites and landmarks All Saints Church: The Anglican parish church is dedicated to All Saints and seats 100 people. It stands alone looking over parkland within the village. It was built with orange ironstone in the fourteenth century with the interior featuring a thirteenth century font and decorated with carvings that date throughout the churches history. The tower was added to the building in the fifteenth century. The church has a truncated steeple (often referred to as the 'Beeby Tub'), unfinished due to the legend of two stonemasons quarrelling and falling to their death. The churches slightly raised setting ensures that it is the focal point for views from all directions across the valley. The Manor House, Beeby: A grade II listed building dating back to the late 18th century, located on the west side of the main street.

Muhlenberg is considered the father of church schools in the United States. An early exponent of the Social Gospel, he founded St. Luke's Hospital in New York City. Muhlenberg was also an early leader of the liturgical movement in Anglican Christianity. His model schools on Long Island had a significant impact on the history of American education. Muhlenberg left his work in secondary education in 1845. Biography Muhlenberg was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 16, 1796. He was a great-grandson of Henry Melchior Muhlenberg (1711‚Äì1787, known as the father of Lutheranism in America) and a grandson of Frederick Muhlenberg (1750‚Äì1801), a member of the First and Second Continental Congresses and Speaker of the House of Representatives. Muhlenberg was educated at the Philadelphia Academy and the Grammar School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from the university in 1815. In 1817 he was ordained a deacon in the Protestant Episcopal Church, becoming assistant to Bishop William White (1748‚Äì1836) in the rectorship of Christ Church, St. Peter's and St. James' in Philadelphia. At this time Muhlenberg was influenced by his older friend, Jackson Kemper (1789‚Äì1870), who became the first Missionary Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1835. In 1820 Muhlenberg was ordained a priest, and until 1826 he was rector of St. James' Church in Lancaster. Largely due to his efforts, Lancaster was the second public-school district created in the state. His interest in church music (particularly hymns) prompted his 1821 pamphlet, A Plea for Christian Hymns, and he compiled Church Poetry in 1823 for his parish. That year Muhlenberg was appointed by the General Convention to its committee on psalms and hymns. Its collection (approved in 1826) contained several of Muhlenberg's compositions, including I Would Not Live Alway, Shout the Glad Tidings and Saviour, Who Thy Flock Art Feeding. Muhlenberg as a young man =Church-school movement= From 1826 to 1845, Muhlenberg was rector of St. George's in Flushing, Queens. In 1828 he became \\"Principal\\" of the \\"Church Institute\\" in Flushing, where he initiated a unique and highly successful method for the education of boys. In 1836, the cornerstone was laid for a new educational enterprise a mile north of Flushing. This more ambitious initiative was named St. Paul's College and Grammar School. (College Point in present-day Queens County NY is where Muhlenberg's school was situated.) Richard Upjohn designed a magnificent main building. The foundations for the building were completed by 1837 and the edifice of pink stone and white marble began to rise on the hill above Long Island Sound. It was not only the unfortunate financial Panic of 1837 but the party squabbling within the Episcopal Church that prevented Muhlenberg from collecting on the pledges to capitalize and endow St. Paul's. Without adequate endowment, the state legislature denied Muhlenberg's request for a collegiate charter, which meant that St. Paul's could not legally grant the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The ruination of St. Paul's left a lasting wound in Muhlenberg's heart. One of the greatest educators in American history‚Äîadmired by even public school promoters‚Äîdeparted Long Island for good in 1847. The property was sold a few years later. But Muhlenberg's philosophy and practice of education had already been handed over to younger men who made a monumental contribution to the history of American education (see John Kerfoot, James Lloyd Breck, and Henry Augustus Coit). =Educational principles= Muhlenberg rejected \\"vague, spiritualized Christianity.\\" His schools blended home, school and church. These Episcopalian communities considered literature, the sciences, and moral education equally in order to mold Christian character rather than pursuing academic excellence alone. Muhlenberg defined character as not only moral goodness, but also the qualities, skills and attitudes favoring effectiveness in the world (for example, to manage a challenging course of study). Academic excellence would inevitably follow. His schools were Christian families, with Christ as the head, and by \\"church school\\" he meant a part of the Body of Christ in which divine grace (God's help) was present for the believer. Muhlenberg and his successors considered the school as the scholastic church. A practical Christian, his Christianity was more practice than theology. Echoing John Henry Newman, Muhlenberg believed that \\"Christianity can not be inculcated in the abstract.\\" One of the least sectarian religious leaders of his generation, he realized that unless a religious school teaches a particular religion it would become secular or splinter into factions. A lasting, healthy religious tolerance in a community is enabled by a religious center (or established discipline) from which hospitality and tolerance radiate to the community. Muhlenberg's experience in public schools from 1818 to 1826 impressed him with the importance of Christian education, and he wanted the Flushing school to build Christian character with denominational instruction. In his 1828 pamphlet The Application of Christianity to Education, he assumed that a moral education would be based on Christianity because of his belief that God revealed himself in a particular way through Jesus Christ. Muhlenberg was confident that through the Bible, humans can glimpse the will of God and a moral education is based on knowledge of that will. A classical scholar familiar with moral goodness in the pagan world, to him the Gospel and Christianity were true and the best education would incorporate them. To Muhlenberg, virtue was synonymous with Christ. According to his 1828 pamphlet, \\"The Law of God is the law of the school\\" as a pattern or blueprint. Muhlenberg strongly discouraged public comparison of weaker to stronger students, and rarely administered corporal punishment; both distinguished him from most contemporary American educators. The schools at Flushing and College Point were happy, busy scholastic brotherhoods. James Lloyd Breck (1818‚Äì1876) spent five years on Long Island with Muhlenberg and his staff. Although considered an ordinary student, he entered the University of Pennsylvania as a third-year student and graduated magna cum laude the following year. After divinity school, Breck went west and founded three seminaries (including Nashotah House Episcopal Seminary in Wisconsin), four boarding schools, three colleges and twenty parochial schools (including Shattuck-St. Mary's School in Faribault, Minnesota). Well-versed in the spread of Christianity during Late Antiquity, he was a missionary among the Mississippi Chippewa in the North Woods of Minnesota and established Muhlenberg-type schools for Ojibwe students. For Muhlenberg, education was holistic and comprehensive. His application of Christianity to education resembled the aims of Horace Mann (1796‚Äì1859) and Thomas Arnold's work at Rugby School beginning in 1828. Foreshadowing John Dewey, Muhlenberg wrote: \\"Some great minds are slow in developing, the acorn gives little promise of the oak\\" and \\"The head should not be furnished at the expense of the heart.\\" He and his scholastic heirs did not allow religion to usurp academic rigor and high scholastic standards: \\"Religion should never be held to account for inferior scholarship.\\" According to Henry Coit (1830‚Äì1895), a disciple of Muhlenberg, \\"A high aim is better than a low one.\\" =Impact on American education= As described earlier, Muhlenberg's Flushing Institute and St. Paul's College failed due to inability to weather the 1837 financial crisis in the United States. However, his pedagogical vision was transported to other regions by his prot√©g√©s. In 1842 he helped found Saint James School in St. James, Maryland with his assistant at St. Paul's College and Grammar School, John Barrett Kerfoot, who later became the first bishop of Pittsburgh and founded Trinity Hall School for Boys (1879) using Muhlenberg's principles. For his work in education, Kerfoot received an honorary doctorate from Cambridge University. Henry Augustus Coit (1830‚Äì1895), a former student of Muhlenberg and Kerfoot, was the founding rector of St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire (1856). Kerfoot's nephew was the founding headmaster of St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts (1865). Endicott Peabody (1857‚Äì1944) founded Groton School in 1884; acknowledging Muhlenberg's influence, he kept his portrait in his study and referred to Groton as a \\"church school\\". The founders of St. George's School in Rhode Island (1896) also cited Muhlenberg as an educational pioneer, and he influenced the 1839 founding of the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. Muhlenberg consulted with EHS founding headmaster William Nelson Pendleton, and sent acolyte Milo Mahan (who taught at St. Paul's in College Point) at the request of the Bishop of Virginia. Historian James McLachlan noted the Muhlenberg schools' uniqueness in American Boarding Schools: A History (1970). =Religious beliefs= Muhlenberg's religion can be difficult to describe. His mature religion may be described as Anglican Christianity with an American accent. He was claimed by different parties within his denomination--the High Church, the Evangelical, the Low Church--but proceeded in his own way. In some respects, he was an early example of what came to be called the Broad Church. He opposed the \\"novelties\\" of Roman Catholicism and dogmatic Protestantism, affirming the Scriptures and church teaching before the 11th-century East‚ÄìWest Schism. Muhlenberg echoed the 17th-century Anglican bishop John Cosin who wrote that his Anglican church was \\"Protestant and Reformed ... according to the Ancient Catholic Church.\\" His position was also similar to Edward Bouverie Pusey (1800‚Äì1882), an Oxford professor and a leader of the 19th-century revival movement in the Church of England. Muhlenberg was influenced by the Oxford Movement, William White (1748‚Äì1836), John Keble, John Henry Newman, Pusey,Ayres Muhlenberg, page 168 Richard Hooker (1554‚Äì1600) and the Christian tolerance of Jeremy Taylor (1613‚Äì1667). As a youth, Muhlenberg worked to become quite familiar with the Fifteen Sermons and Analogy of Religion of Bishop Joseph Butler (1692‚Äì1752). Born a Lutheran, Muhlenberg converted to the Protestant Episcopal Church as a boy. Trained in Philadelphia by William White and prepared for ordination by Jackson Kemper, he began to call his religion \\"Evangelical and Catholic\\" in the late-1840s and published a newspaper of that name in the 1850s. By \\"evangelical,\\" Muhlenberg meant personal devotion to Jesus Christ, dedication to the Scriptures as the Word of God, and the responsibility to live and share the Gospel. \\"Evangelical\\" connoted what is spontaneous and Spirit-led about Christianity. By \\"Catholic,\\" Muhlenberg meant the \\"bones\\" of the Faith: tradition, creeds, liturgy, and sacraments. Newman's eight-volume Parochial and Plain Sermons parallel many of Muhlenberg's views. Muhlenberg worshiped Christ without sentimentality, believing that Jesus lived in his schools, his parish church, and in St. Luke's Hospital, New York, where he ministered to the sick and dying. When he created St. Johnland on Long Island late in his life, he would say that the primary study in the educational programs there was \\"Jesus.\\" The history of persons and of institutions is a diachronic phenomenon; time does not stand still and everything changes. Muhlenberg's faith and practice developed over the decades. He was a born reformer and did effect reforms in the PECUSA. He inspired many High Churchmen and those who came to be called \\"Anglo- Catholics,\\" but he was neither a High Churchman nor an Anglo-Catholic. He was well known as an innovator of divine worship but was never a true \\"ritualist.\\" The ritualism he introduced in his school chapels had one purpose: to impress upon the minds of his boys the great doctrines of Christianity. The concept worked to good effect. It was as much a Lockean as an Anglo-Catholic idea: He wanted to give vivid impressions to young minds. Muhlenberg was neither particularly romantic nor conservative or reactionary. Although several of Muhlenberg's former students and followers became Anglo-Catholics, he was dismayed when Newman converted to Roman Catholicism in 1845. Unthreatened by Darwinism, Muhlenberg was interested in modern ideas. He wrote patriotic poems and was the first Episcopal priest to hold a weekly Eucharist and daily offices. In 1853, he submitted a resolution to the General Convention of the Episcopal Church which became known as the Muhlenberg Memorial. The resolution calling for open-mindedness and the freedom of parish clergy to be responsive to parishioner needs, especially concerning Sunday-morning worship.A History of the Episcopal Church by Robert Prichard, pp. 150-51 Some of Muhlenberg's papers and articles were published in two volumes from 1875 to 1877 as Evangelical Catholic Papers by Anne Ayres, who also wrote his official biography from papers he saved for her (disregarding his request to destroy them after his death). =Later years= Muhlenberg in later years In 1845, Muhlenberg moved to New York City. The following year he became rector of the Church of the Holy Communion, a rent-free church built by his sister Mary A. Rogers. Muhlenberg founded the first American order of Protestant Episcopal deaconesses, the Sisterhood of the Church of the Holy Communion, between 1845 and 1852. His work with the sisterhood led to the 1850 establishment of St. Luke's Hospital, for which his congregation made offerings each St. Luke's Day beginning in 1847. In 1866, Muhlenberg founded the Church Industrial Community of St. Johnland on Long Island. He bought , with of shorefront on Long Island Sound near Kings Park as a home for young, crippled children and the elderly. A moderate rent was charged for the cottages. Muhlenberg died on April 8, 1877 in St. Luke's Hospital, and is buried in the St. Johnland cemetery. Muhlenberg is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the U.S. Episcopal Church on April 8, his death day. His reputation as an educator has been partially overshadowed by his extracurricular achievements after his move to New York City.

It is named after Robert James Blattner, despite not being formulated as a conjecture by him. Statement Blattner's formula says that if a discrete series representation with infinitesimal character Œª is restricted to a maximal compact subgroup K, then the representation of K with highest weight Œº occurs with multiplicity :\\\\sum_{w\\\\in W_K}\\\\epsilon(\\\\omega)Q(w(\\\\mu+\\\\rho_c)-\\\\lambda-\\\\rho_n) where :Q is the number of ways a vector can be written as a sum of non-compact positive roots :WK is the Weyl group of K :œÅc is half the sum of the compact roots :œÅn is half the sum of the non-compact roots :Œµ is the sign character of WK. Blattner's formula is what one gets by formally restricting the Harish-Chandra character formula for a discrete series representation to the maximal torus of a maximal compact group. The problem in proving the Blattner formula is that this only gives the character on the regular elements of the maximal torus, and one also needs to control its behavior on the singular elements. For non-discrete irreducible representations the formal restriction of Harish-Chandra's character formula need not give the decomposition under the maximal compact subgroup: for example, for the principal series representations of SL2 the character is identically zero on the non-singular elements of the maximal compact subgroup, but the representation is not zero on this subgroup. In this case the character is a distribution on the maximal compact subgroup with support on the singular elements. History Harish-Chandra orally attributed the conjecture to Robert James Blattner as a question Blattner raised, not a conjecture made by Blattner. Blattner did not publish it in any form. It first appeared in print in , where it was first referred to as \\"Blattner's Conjecture,\\" despite the results of that paper having been obtained without knowledge of Blattner's question and notwithstanding Blattner's not having made such a conjecture. mentioned a special case of it slightly earlier. proved Blattner's formula in some special cases. showed that Blattner's formula gave an upper bound for the multiplicities of K-representations, proved Blattner's conjecture for groups whose symmetric space is Hermitian, and proved Blattner's conjecture for linear semisimple groups.

It is situated north-east of Leicester, and only a short way from Leicester's urban sprawl in Thurmaston and Syston. Nearby villages are Beeby and Barkby Thorpe. Barkby Brook is the main watercourse which flows through Barkby. The parish has a population of around 300. In the 1870s John Marius Wilson stated that Barkby, :\\"lies on an affluent of the river Wreak, 1¬Ω mile S by E of Syston r. station, and 4¬Ω NE of Leicester; and it includes the hamlet of Hambleton.\\" History 20th century map showing Barkby, LeicestershireThe 1086 Domesday Book records Barkby as \\"Barcheberie\\". The name Barkby itself has an Old Norse origin meaning \\"Barki's farm/settlement\\". Barkby Hall, home and seat of the Pochin family since 1604, is a grade II listed building situated next to St Mary's Church. The country house has 3 storeys and 8-bay frontage, constructed in rendered brick c.1810. =St Mary's Church= The parish church situated in Barkby is dedicated to St Mary. Earliest records state that the church was built in the late 13th century but its ground undertook extension in 1887. The grade I church was officially listed in June 1966. The Church itself contains 6 bells and a 2 aisle nave. The church also consists of a tower made up of 4 stages and a gothic organ case. Built primarily from ironstone, granite was infused into the buildings structure during restoration work in the 19th century. The presence of the Pochin family is also noticeable within St Mary's church as a number of memorials of past family members can also be found around the Church. =Occupations= Male and female occupations in Barkby, Leicestershire in 1881 1881 gave birth to the most organised classification of occupation within a UK Census. The total population in Barby was revealed to be 579 in this year, 305 of which were of an age able to have a form of occupation. This can be compared to 2011 where 179 individuals were at employment age. Occupation sectors which were present in Barkby at this time included, Transport & Communications, Textile Fabrics and Local government. However, a significant disparity in occupation between males and females was evident. In fact the 1881 Census showed that females were only present in 5 occupational sectors within Barkby; the majority being in Domestic Service or Offices. The most male dominated industry at this time was the agricultural sector, where 60 males in Barbky were employed compared to 0 females. However the number of individuals working agriculture decreased significantly by 2011, with only 7 Barkby residents now working in the sector. In 1881,the majority of females in Barkby (100) had no specific occupation compared to just 5 males with the same situation, however, this statistic does not necessarily indicate unemployment. In comparison, the disparities in occupation are not as noticeable in 2011, where the majority of both males (16) and females (20) can be found working in the wholesale and retail trade industry. Population Total population of Barkby, Leicestershire, as reported by the Census of Population from 1801-2011Barkby has a current population of 316 according to the United Kingdom Census 2011, however throughout its history, Barkby's population has fluctuated significantly. Between 1801 and 2011 the population peaked at 955 in 1931. Within this time period there has also been two major decreases in Barkby's population. These came in between 1851-1861 where population fell from 857 to 504 and also between 1931-1951 where population fell from 955 to 405. Since 1951 however, the population has continued to decrease. Geography Barkby is situated approximately 5 miles from the centre of Leicester. The parish's landscape is dominated mostly by farmland from four farms. Nevertheless, the parish is not completely secluded as it is located adjacent to the villages of Syston and Thurmaston both of which have larger populations than Barkby. Barkby Brook is the main water source which runs through the parish. Classified as a \\"main river\\", Barkby Brook is currently managed by the Environment Agency. Education Pochin school is the only school situated in Barkby. The primary school was initially founded by the Pochin family in the 1700s, who sought to provide education for the poorest children living in Barkby. The subjects taught in the school at this time were very different to what can be expected in the modern day education system. Needlework, singing and drilling were all subjects taught in the school's earliest days. During this time, the local church helped to fund and run the school, however, due to the Education Act 1944 responsibility for the school was handed over to the education authority. As a primary school, Pochin school educates children aged between 4‚Äì11 years old. In 1869 the main building, which now contains 5 classrooms in total was built. A total of 142 children currently attend the school, from Barkby as well as surrounding villages such as Thurmaston and Queniborough due to its popularity. The school received an \\"Outstanding\\" rating on its latest Ofsted report in May 2014. North east of Leicester sustainable urban extension The north east of Leicester sustainable urban extension (NEoLSUE) is a proposed development set in the area surrounding Barkby. Described as \\"locally distinctive, sustainable and thriving new community\\" the project will entail constructing up to 4500 new homes as well as health and school facilities. A number of green spaces are also proposed to be placed within the new community. The main purpose of this development is to facilitate the ever increasing urban sprawl of Leicester and its surrounding villages such as Thurmaston, reducing housing price pressures in the process. However, many in Barkby are very much against the development. One of their main arguments is the significant increase in traffic pressures on the roads in and around Barkby as a result of the development. All in all locals believe that such a development would threaten the rural idyll identity of the parish.

Margaret O'Neill (or O'Neale) Eaton (December 3, 1799 ‚Äì November 8, 1879), better known as Peggy Eaton, was the wife of John Henry Eaton, a United States Senator from Tennessee and United States Secretary of War, and a confidant of Andrew Jackson. Their marriage was the cause of a national controversy known as the Petticoat Affair. Early life Margaret \\"Peggy\\" O'Neill was the daughter of Rhoda Howell and William O'Neill,Coit, p. 546. the owner of Franklin House, a popular Washington, D.C. hotel. As a girl, she was noted for her beauty, wit and vivacity.

William T. Barry, who later served as Postmaster General, wrote \\"of a charming little girl ... who very frequently plays the piano, and entertains us with agreeable songs.\\" As a young girl, her reputation was already under scrutiny because she worked in a bar frequented by men and casually bantered with the boardinghouse clientele. An elderly Peggy reminisced that, \\"While I was still in pantalets and rolling hoops with other girls I had the attention of men, young and old, enough to turn a girl's head.\\" First marriage About 1816, at age 17, Margaret O'Neale married John B. Timberlake, a 39-year-old purser in the Navy. Her parents gave them a house across from the hotel, and they met many politicians who stayed there. In 1818 they met and befriended John Henry Eaton, a 28-year-old widower and newly elected senator from Tennessee. Margaret and John Timberlake had two children. A third had died in infancy.The Timberlakes' daughter Virginia, after a broken engagement to Philip Barton Key II, son of Francis Scott Key, married a French diplomat, Antoine Sampayo. One of the Sampayos' granddaughters was Olga de Meyer, the wife of photographer Adolph de Meyer. Second marriage and scandal John Timberlake died in 1828 while at sea in the Mediterranean, in service on a four-year voyage. Though the conventions of society required an extended mourning period, the widow Margaret Timberlake married Senator Eaton on January 1, 1829, just nine months after Timberlake's death. As a result, rumors circulated that Timberlake had committed suicide because of despair at an alleged affair between his wife and Eaton. An autopsy concluded that Timberlake died of pneumonia brought on by pulmonary disease. After Eaton was appointed as Secretary of War, rumors continued and Peggy Eaton was snubbed by other cabinet wives. Her honor was defended by President Andrew Jackson and she became the subject of the Petticoat affair, in which the wives of cabinet members and other prominent Washingtonians refused to pay social calls on the Eatons and refused them invitations to parties and other events. Jackson tried unsuccessfully to coerce the cabinet wives into ending their snubbing of the Eatons. Vice President John C. Calhoun, whose wife, Floride Calhoun, was seen as the anti- Peggy ringleader, supported his wife. This caused Jackson to transfer his favor to widower Martin Van Buren, the Secretary of State, who had taken the Eatons' side and shown positive social attention to Mrs. Eaton. Van Buren helped end the Petticoat Affair by resigning, which gave Jackson the ability to remove his anti-Eaton cabinet members. Calhoun was not renominated for vice president and resigned shortly before the end of his term to accept election to the U.S. Senate. Van Buren became vice president in 1833, and was well- placed to become Jackson's successor in 1837. Societal implications Historian John F. Marszalek explained his view of the real reasons Washington society found Peggy unacceptable: > She did not know her place; she forthrightly spoke up about anything that > came to her mind, even topics of which women were supposed to be ignorant. > She thrust herself into the world in a manner inappropriate for a woman. ... > Accept her, and society was in danger of disruption. Accept this uncouth, > impure, forward, worldly woman, and the wall of virtue and morality would be > breached and society would have no further defenses against the forces of > frightening change. Margaret Eaton was not that important in herself; it was > what she represented that constituted the threat. Proper women had no > choice; they had to prevent her acceptance into society as part of their > defense of that society's morality. Author Jon Meacham points out that Peggy Eaton's life was unusual for its time. She was, according to Meacham \\"by her own account ... an outgoing flirt\\" - her tongue was \\"ungoverned, and ungovernable.\\" He also points out that she craved attention: \\"At various points in her life she was courted by an adjutant general, a major and a captain ‚Äì which delighted her.\\" In a memoir published long after her death, she admitted to the accuracy of some of the characterizations of her: \\"The fact is, I never had a lover who was not a gentleman and was not in a good position in society.\\" \\"I must have said a great many foolish things\\" wrote Margaret, \\"I am sure I did very few wise ones. I was foolish, hasty, but not vicious.\\" Refusing to defend herself directly, Peggy Eaton expressed her opinion of her critics this way: \\"I was quite as independent as they, and had more powerful friends ... None of them had beauty, accomplishments or graces in society of any kind, and for these reasons ... they were jealous of me.\\" Meacham observes that, \\"it's impossible ... to assess the truth of the charges\\" lodged by her enemies, but \\"she offers this \\"interesting defense\\": \\"Just let a little commonsense be exercised. While I do not pretend to be a saint, and do not think I was ever very much stocked with sense, and lay no claim to be a model woman in any way, I put it to the candor of the world whether the slanders which have been uttered against me are to be believed.\\" Third marriage and later life Margaret O'Neill Eaton in later life Three years after the death of her second husband, Margaret Eaton married Antonio Gabriele Buchignani, an Italian music teacher and dancing master, on June 7, 1859.Eli Field Cooley and William Scudder Cooley, Genealogy of Early Settlers of Trenton and Ewing, (W. S. Sharp, 1889), page 157 She was 59 and he was in his mid 20s. The marriage reignited much of the social stigma Margaret had carried earlier in life. In 1866, their seventh year of marriage, Buchignani ran off to Europe with the bulk of his wife's fortune as well as her 17-year-old granddaughter Emily E. Randolph. He married Randolph after he and Margaret divorced in 1869.{The Charleston daily News, September 14, 1868} In September 1868 Peggy appeared against Buchignani in the Jefferson Market Police CourtBuchignani was close to the family of Abraham Lincoln, who appointed him as secretary to the U.S. legation at Naples and then assistant librarian of Congress. In New York City, during his marriage to Eaton, he operated the Opera Caf√© and Hotel. According to an 1868 article about the case in The New York Times, Margaret Eaton agreed to divorce her husband if he would marry her granddaughter and restore her good name.Evening Star {Washington DC}, December 24, 1891 reports Gabriel Antonio Buchignani died in New York City on December 22, 1891 age 57 and that his wife Emily had \\"died some years ago\\" A son Emile Buchignani was born 1874 in Tennessee and married in New York City in 1908] Although Margaret Eaton obtained a divorce from Buchignani, she was not able to recover her financial standing. She died in poverty in Washington, D.C. on November 8, 1879, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery.Notable American Women Cultural references The 1936 film The Gorgeous Hussy, starring Joan Crawford, was loosely based on the life of Margaret O'Neill.

However, in 2017, the statue of St Paul was decapitated and the head placed outside the front door of the presbytery. There has been press speculation that this incident occurred in order to intimidate the resident priest, Fr Jean-Marie Belanga. Both statues were removed shortly after the incident by the local administration for repairs. Fr Belanga, who had previously been stopped from preaching by the Archdiocese due to complaints about the conservative and Catholic nature of his homilies, was also subsequently removed from his position as parish priest in the village and told to leave Luxembourg.

Mackay was one of the four Bonanza Kings, a partnership which capitalised on the wealth generated by the silver mines at the Comstock Lode. Life and career =Early years= John William Mackay was born in Dublin to a working-class family, they had a dirt floor hovel shared with a pig. In 1840, the family emigrated to the notorious Five Points slum in lower Manhattan; his father dying soon after. As a boy Mackay hawked newspapers such as the New York Herald, and later apprenticed at William H. Webb Shipyard to support his mother and sister. =Gold and silver mining= In 1851, he sailed by clipper around the Horn to California and worked eight years in placer gold fields in Sierra County without much success. In 1859, he went to Virginia City, Nevada, site of the recently discovered Comstock Lode, and there began work at $4 a day laboring in a mine by day and working his own small claims in his spare time. He bought small claims or \\"feet\\" and used the proceeds of his labor and finds to buy more feet. In 1865 he used his savings to buy into the Kentuck mine and hit big, he was suddenly worth US$1.6 million, more than enough to retire for life. He then began investing in other mines, sometimes risking everything he had. He formed a business partnership with fellow Irishmen James Graham Fair, James C. Flood, and William S. O'Brien, later known as the Bonanza Kings. The four dealt in mining stocks and operated silver mines, and had a success in the Hale & Norcross mine. In 1871, using proceeds from the Hale & Norcross they bought out a number of smaller mine claims under the name of the Consolidated Virginia Mining Company, and later added the nearby California mine. In 1873, the Con Virginia made the greatest ore body discovery ever found in North America, known as the \\"Big Bonanza\\". The strike would pay out US$181 billion in current dollars, with Mackay's portion being about $50 billion. The bonanza was in a location previously overlooked and outside where other strikes had been found. The four-way partnership was more commonly known as the \\"Bonanza firm\\". With the proceeds, together they established the Bank of Nevada of San Francisco to compete with the Bank of California. =Marriage= In 1866, he married Marie Louise Hungerford, a native New Yorker. Snubbed by New York society, Louise moved to Paris where Mackay purchased a large mansion for her where his wealth enabled her to become a noted society hostess for two decades, entertaining royalty and throwing lavish parties. =Communications companies= In 1884, with James Gordon Bennett, Jr., Mackay formed the Commercial Cable Company, largely to fight Jay Gould and the Western Union Telegraph Company, laid two transatlantic cables, and forced the toll-rate for transatlantic messages down to twenty-five cents a word. In connection with the Commercial Cable Company, he formed in 1886 the Postal Telegraph Company as a domestic wire telegraph company so that Commercial would not need to rely on Western Union to collect and distribute telegraphic messages. Until Mackay and Bennett entered the field, all submarine cable traffic between the United States and Europe went over cables owned by the American financier Jay Gould. A rate war followed that took almost two years to conclude. Jay Gould finally quit trying to run John Mackay out of business. He was quoted as saying in reference to Mackay, \\"If he needs another million he will go into his silver mines and dig it out\\".Smith, G.H., 1943, The History of the Comstock Lode, 1850‚Äì1997, Reno: University of Nevada Press, Statue of John William Mackay in front of Mackay School of Mines building, by Gutzon Borglum dedicated June 1908 Once Mackay had conquered the Atlantic with the Commercial Cable Company and North America with the Postal Telegraph Company he turned his sights to laying the first cable across the Pacific. He subsequently formed the Commercial Pacific Cable Company in secret partnership with the Great Northern Telegraph Company and the Eastern Telegraph Company. Although he died in 1902 before his vision was completed, his son Clarence H. Mackay, saw the project through to completion between 1904 and 1906. Commercial Pacific operated a cable line from San Francisco to Manila, Philippines, via Hawaii and Guam, with a subsequent spur that went from Manila to Shanghai, China. The Mackay System expanded under Clarence H. Mackay's leadership, acquiring several other entities including the Federal Telegraph Company, its radio stations and research laboratories, in 1927. In 1928, the entire system was bought out by Sosthenes Behn's International Telephone and Telegraph. ITT organized the Postal Telegraph & Cable Corporation as a shell to acquire and control the Mackay System on May 18, 1928.Robert Sobel, ITT: The Management of Opportunity (Beard Books, 2000): 59-60. Though plagued with financial troubles during the Great Depression, the Mackay System continued to be the chief rival of Western Union until 1943. In March of that year, Congress authorized an amendment (Section 222) to the Communications Act of 1934 permitting the merger of the domestic operations of telegraph companies (clearing the way for Western Union to acquire Postal Telegraph). By May 1943 a merger plan had been put together, which the FCC approved by September, and the merger was completed by October 1943. The international communications (cable and radio) parts of the Mackay System remained with ITT. =Other ventures= The New York, Texas and Mexican Railway was chartered in 1880 by Joseph Telfener and his father-in-law Daniel E. Hungerford. A Texas corporation was formed to take advantage of the state's generous land grants and build a railroad from Richmond to Brownsville. Work started in September 1881 and of track were constructed between Rosenberg and Victoria by the end of 1882. The railroad became known as the \\"Macaroni Line\\" because 1,200 Italian immigrants were brought to the United States to build it. Texas passed a law in 1882 voiding any land grants to railroads. In January 1885 Telfener sold the railroad to his brother-in-law Mackay, who sold it to the Southern Pacific Railroad in September that year. The railroad continued to operate under its old name until 1905. In addition to the Bank of Nevada and the communications companies, Mackay held interests in mines in Colorado, Idaho, and Alaska and timber lands and ranches in California. He owned part of the Spreckels Sugar Company and part of the Sprague Elevator and Electrical Works, and he served as a director of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Southern Pacific Railroad. Philanthropy Mackay was famous for fair dealings with his employees, and gave generously, especially to the charities of the Roman Catholic Church, and endowed the Catholic orphan asylum in Virginia City, Nevada. In June 1908 the Mackay School of Mines building was presented to the University of Nevada, as a memorial to him, by his widow and his son, Clarence H. Mackay. A statue of John Mackay by Gutzon Borglum stands in front of the Mackay Mines building on the university campus in Reno, Nevada. Death Mackay died of heart failure on July 20, 1902, in London. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn; his mausoleum was described in 2018, by Scribner Associate Editor Sarah Goldberg, as \\"by far the most impressive mausoleum in the cemetery, atop a shady hill\\". The mausoleum was originally created for Mackay's oldest son, John, Jr., who died in a horse riding accident in 1895. Mackay never fully overcame his grief and was entombed with his son seven years later. Honours The town of Mackay, Idaho was named in his honour as he owned the local copper mines. The nearby Mackay Peak in the White Knob Mountains is also named after him. Mackay appears several times as a character in the novel 'Comstock Lode' by Louis L'Amour.

This record still stands; Munro was 68 and was riding a 47-year-old machine when he set his last record.Bonneville certified bike records Working from his home in Invercargill, he spent 20 years to highly modify the 1920 Indian motorcycle that he had bought that same year. Munro set his first New Zealand speed record in 1938 and later set seven more. He travelled to compete at the Bonneville Salt Flats, attempting to set world speed records. During his ten visits to the salt flats, he set three speed records, one of which still stands. His efforts, and success, are the basis of the motion picture The World's Fastest Indian (2005), starring Anthony Hopkins, and an earlier 1971 short documentary film Burt Munro: Offerings to the God of Speed, both directed by Roger Donaldson.Burt Munro: Offerings to the God of Speed at IMDB  Early life  Munro was born in 1899 to William Munro, a farmer and Lily Agnes Robinson in Invercargill.Burt Munro : The Lost InterviewsBy Neill Birss His twin sister died at birth and Munro grew up on a farm in Edendale, east of Invercargill. His grandfather was from northern Scotland and settled on a farm in Invercargill. Munro's interest in speed began at an early age, riding the family's fastest horse across the farm, despite the complaints of his father. Trips via train to the Invercargill port were a rare source of excitement, and the arrival of cars, motorcycles and aircraft added to Burt's eagerness to join the world outside his farm. As Munro's family discouraged his endeavours outside farm life, he became constantly bored with daily routine. At the outbreak of the First World War, he intended to go to war as soon as he was old enough, for a chance to see the world.Tim Hanna One good run: The legend of Burt Munro, Penguin Books, 2005; Munro remained on the family farm until the end of the First World War, when his father sold the farm. At that time, Munro worked on the Otira Tunnel construction until recalled to work with his father on a newly purchased farm. After this he became a professional speedway rider, but returned home to the family farm at the start of the Great Depression. Finding work as a motorcycle salesman and mechanic, he raced motorcycles and rose to the top of the New Zealand motorcycle scene, racing on Oreti Beach and later in Melbourne, Australia. After the Second World War, Munro and his wife divorced, and he subsequently gave up work to reside in a lock-up garage.

Munro's two greatest challenges while modifying his bike were his lack of money and that he worked full-time as a motorcycle salesman. He would often work overnight on his bikes (he had a 1936 Velocette MSS as well), then he would go to work in the morning, having had no sleep. Being of modest means, he would often make his own parts and tools instead of having them professionally built. He would cast parts in old tins, make his own barrels, pistons, flywheels, and such; his micrometer was an old spoke. Munro's Indian on display in Invercargill In its final stages, the Indian's displacement was 950 cc (as built it was 600 cc) and was driven by a triple chain drive system. The \\"Munro Special,\\" as Munro called his bike, is now owned by Neville Hayes, in New Zealand's South Island, and is on display at E Hayes & Sons, Invercargill. There is also a second motorcycle purported to be the original \\"Munro Special\\" in Te Papa Museum in Wellington. Bonneville Salt Flats and Speed Week The Bonneville Salt Flats in northwestern Utah, USA is known worldwide for its many miles of flat, compacted salt; perfect for testing speed machines. During Speed Week, usually in mid-late August, vehicle enthusiasts from around the world gather at Bonneville. Munro travelled to Bonneville ten times, the first time for \\"sightseeing\\" purposes. In the nine times he raced at Bonneville,Motor Cycle, 20 April 1967, pp. 482‚Äì484 Dragnut by George Wilson. \\"Last year marked Bert's [sic] ninth Stateside visit\\".

Other towns within the commune include Altwies and Ellange. History The area was first inhabited by the Celts. The Romans, who arrived in 65 BC, built the Castel on Celtic foundations to protect the road from Metz to Trier. It was one of Charlemagne's nieces, Muomina, who is behind the village's name. In the 9th century, she donated all her possessions including the little village to Echternach Abbey. The village was subsequently called Muomendorph. Over the centuries, Mondorf was frequently attacked, burnt down and rebuilt. St Michael's Church from 1065 was rebuilt on four occasions, the last time in 1764.\\"History\\" , Mondorf: Domaine Thermal. Retrieved 22 February 2011. It was in the 1840s that the thermal waters were uncovered as a result of deep drilling for salt which had become highly taxed under the Dutch. Karl Gotthelf Kind, who had found salt in Germany and hoped to do the same in Mondorf, discovered the waters after drilling to a record depth of 736 metres. Despite their mineral properties, the waters were not suitable for salt a brownish colour caused by the rich iron content which emerged after distilling. Nevertheless, the local notary, J.-P. Ledure, saw other opportunities for the waters and was successful in finding support for setting up the \\"Soci√©t√© des Bains de Mondorf\\". The architect Charles Eydt was immediately commissioned to build the thermal establishment which was inaugurated on 20 June 1847. As a result of the spa's success, the village prospered as rich French guests came to stay in the luxurious hotels which sprang up in the vicinity. The flow of visitors from France was however halted in 1871 when the Germans occupied Alsace and Lorraine. Despite acquiring the name of Mondorf-les-Bains on 28 August 1878, the spa had been undergoing a significant decline since 1871. Only after the State took over the facilities on 21 April 1886 were its fortunes improved. Minister of State Paul Eyschen was particularly successful in reviving interest, encouraging visitors to come from Belgium. In the early 20th century, the State invested heavily in the resort adding a pavilion for the original source, a banqueting hall and a reading room as well as the Orangerie and the country‚Äôs first indoor swimming pool. The park was also enlarged. A railway to Thionville was opened in 1903 and, in 1913, the Marie- Adela√Øde Source, named after the grand duchess was added after drilling to a depth of 464 metres.

It is on the A60, north-east of Loughborough. The village is just south of the border with Nottinghamshire. Nearby places are Prestwold (to the south), Wymeswold (to the east), and Rempstone (to the north, in Nottinghamshire). Hoton includes a small burial ground in the centre of the village. According to the 2011 Census the population is 353 people. Total Population of Hoton as reported by the census population 1811-2011 In 1870, Hoton was described as: :\\"A township and chapelry in Prestwold parish, Leicester; near the river Soar and the boundary with Notts, 3¬º miles NE of Loughborough railway station\\" History After the Norman conquest in 1300, together Robert De Jort and Earl Hugh owned the land. Hoton was sparsely populated with eleven households in the 1300s, nine in 1564. By the time the 1666 hearth tax list was drawn up there were nineteen. Hoton once consisted of three 400 acre patches of agricultural land, though due to the 1760 Enclosure Act more small fields were established and agricultural patterns changed. When Charles James Packe II brought the Hoton Manor house it led to the development of the area. An ale house, an inn and two girls boarding schools were built, as well as further farm buildings and cottages, leading to a further increase in population. Despite this the census reports show a decline in population from 460 people in 94 houses in 1841, to 294 people in 78 houses by 1891. Throughout the 1800s Hoton saw various changes that improved the parish. Care for the poor, maintenance of roads and facilities were all carried out by able bodied men in the area. Many old wooden built cottages were replaced by brick cottages, as well as given small allotments to give farmers extra growing space for personal use. Sanitation was improved as many toilets were now outside rather than within the home, preventing the spread of disease. Despite this as late as the 1880s cases of typhoid, diphtheria and ringworm we still being treated. Demographics Occupation in Hoton is significantly different between 1881 and 2011. Most of the work in 1881 was unknown especially for females, this most likely due to the old patriarchal society of the time. Only workers in dress had a higher female occupation in 1881, all other occupations men had a greater number workers. In contrast in 2011 occupation shifts to more modern jobs and statistics are taken as a total population not male and female. The highest number of people work in professional occupations (46) and the lowest in process, plant and machine operatives. The significant difference in type of occupation is down to the dramatic changes over time. Through the industrial revolution removing significant agriculture reliance to the new computer age of the 21st century. Places of interest The Packe Arms is a country pub and restaurant in the heart of Hoton. The pub was once known as The Marquis of Granby, though in the 1800s Charles James Packe restored the pub, changing the name to The Packe Arms. Of the 77 public reviews placed on Tripadvisor 55% recommend the bar/restaurant. The Good Pub Guide says The Packe Arms is 'worth a visit' describing the pub as 'spacious old Vintage Inn with sturdy beams and open fires' with 'prompt friendly service from uniformed staff'. Church of Saint Leonard. St. Leonards is an old church located on Wymeswold Road and is now a private residence. (The nearest place of worship is now located in Prestwold, St Andrew's Church). The church had financial issues which concluded with the closure. The major decline began after World War II, land was becoming privately owned which meant the church lost a significant number of its farms. In an attempt to help, the church volunteers helped level out the church grounds in 1969, though after this the structural condition of the church itself only declined. The various contents of the church were given to different churches, most notably the organ to Wartnaby and the pews to Branston. Transport Bus - There are two main bus services that run through Hoton. The Kinchbus 9 service connects Loughborough and Nottingham stopping once in Hoton. This service runs up to every 30 minutes. The second bus is the Premiere X9 service, again running from Loughborough to Nottingham. The bus stops at Vine Tree Terrace bus stop which is on the A30 Loughborough Road.

Munro set numerous land speed records for motorcycles with engines less than 1,000 cc at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in the late 1950s and into the 1960s. The film stars Anthony Hopkins, and was produced, written and directed by Roger Donaldson. The film opened on 7 December 2005 in New Zealand to positive reviews, and quickly became the highest grossing local film at the New Zealand box-office taking in NZ$7,043,000;New Zealand box office Top 10 and taking in over US$18,297,690 worldwide. The film was theatrically released on 3 February 2006 in the United States by Magnolia Pictures; and was subsequently released on DVD on 22 December 2006 by Magnolia Home Entertainment. Plot In 1962, Burt Munro is a sort of folk hero in his home town of Invercargill, New Zealand, known for his friendly easy-going personality, for having the fastest motorcycle in New Zealand and Australia, and for being featured in Popular Mechanics magazine. However, that recognition is contrasted by his exasperated next-door neighbours, some of whom are fed up with his un-neighbourly habits; such as revving his motorbike early in the morning, urinating on his lemon tree, and not mowing his grass. Burt, however, has a long-time dream; to travel to the US and test his motorbike's capabilities at the Bonneville Speedway. However, while modifying his motorcycle, Burt suffers a heart attack. An ambulance takes him to hospital and he is told he has angina, and is advised to take it easy and not to ride his motorcycle. Burt ignores this advice, and is given medication. Burt is finally able to save enough to travel by cargo ship to Los Angeles, working his passage as the cook, but when he arrives, he experiences bureaucracy, skepticism, and the indifference of big city people. It is his blunt but gregarious nature which overcomes each hurdle. He wins over the motel clerk, a transgender woman named Tina, who assists him in clearing customs and helps him in buying a car. The car salesman allows Burt to use his workshop and junkyard to build a trailer, and later offers him a job after Burt fine-tunes a number of the cars on the lot. Burt declines the offer, however, and shortly afterwards begins his long trip to Utah. Along the way, Burt meets numerous helpful people, including highway police, a Native American who aids him when his trailer fails, a woman named Ada who allows him to repair his trailer and briefly becomes his lover, and an Air Force pilot who is on leave from military service in Vietnam. He finally arrives at the Bonneville Salt Flats, only to be blocked by race officials for not registering his motorcycle for competition in advance, and not having the mandated safety equipment. In a show of sportsmanship, however, various competitors and fans in the Bonneville series intervene on his behalf, and he is eventually allowed to make a timed run. Despite various problems, he succeeds in his quest and sets a new land speed record at the 8th mile of his run; when he reaches 201.851 mph (324.847 km/h). By the end, his leg is burned by the exhaust, and he then falls with the motorcycle and skids to a stop, but he is able to return home to New Zealand a hero.

Arranging the financing for a full feature film was much more difficult, but a key Japanese investor, and Donaldson and Hannam's own money allowed the film to be made.\\"An interview with writer/director and producer Roger Donaldson\\", TVNZ.co.nz\\"Donaldson on World's Fastest Indian\\", 17 December 2005, emanuellevy.com In interviews, Hopkins stated that Munro was one of the easiest roles that he has ever played in his career; simply because Munro's view on life was not all that different from his own. Many of the props used for filming were actually owned by Munro, including all the exploded pistons and the piston mould that Hopkins uses for a scene in the film. These were on display at the Southland Museum and Art Gallery. The location used for Burt Munro's home and workshop in New Zealand took place on an empty section on Lithgow Street in Invercargill, this section was used as the headquarters for the notorious Black Power gang during the 1990s until the house burnt down in 1998. A house has been built on the plot since the film was released. Historical accuracy Indian used in the movie The real Burt Munro married Florence Beryl Martyn on 6 August 1925; they divorced in 1950/51. While the couple had four children together, no mention is made of children in the film; but it is implied that he was married, and either estranged or divorced. The Munro portrayed in the film recalls the death of a twin brother named Ernie, who died when a tree fell on him. The real Munro had an older brother who was killed when a tree fell on him. Munro also had a stillborn twin sister. The real Munro had set numerous speed records in New Zealand during the late 1930s through the early 1970s. However, these records are only implied in the film. Munro was never known to actually urinate on his lemon tree; film director Roger Donaldson added that detail as a tribute to his own father, who did. In reality, Munro's record- breaking run at Bonneville came after several separate visits to the US, beginning in 1956. This was demonstrated, for instance, by a letter published in the May 1957 edition of Popular Mechanics (p. 6), which referred to 'H. A. \\"Dad\\" Munro' and his 1920 Indian Scout.Popular Mechanics - May 1957 The visit to Bonneville shown in the film was a composite of several made by Munro. In 1962 he set a record of 178.971 mph at Bonneville. His fastest complete run there was 190.07 mph. While Munro did reach 205.67 mph on an uncompleted run, on which he crashed,Burt Munro - A New Zealand Legend, The Munro Special he never set a record of 201 mph at Bonneville (as the film suggests). Near the end of the film, Speed Week participants throw money into 'the hat', and Burt Munro is presented with a bag of cash before he sets the speed record. In fact, Munro had to take up a collection before Speed Week, as US Customs required a cash bond before releasing his motorcycle.gsbmwr.org/httpdocs/Archives/Munro.pdf From the article HERO! reprinted through the courtesy of Classic Bike magazine by the Granite State BMW Riders A photograph of the gathered crowd presenting Munro with the bag of cash, in 1962, was reprinted in a 2006 issue of Hot Rod magazine. Hopkins' portrayal of a New Zealander The Welsh-born Hopkins did not employ the Kiwi accent which the real Munro would have had ‚Äî the review in The New Zealand Herald said that \\"his vowels swoop from the Welsh valleys to the high veldt without ever alighting in Southland\\" (Munro's home region of New Zealand).

The fell's name is derived from two words from the Old Norse language, Hind and Skarth, and means the pass used by the red deer. Topography The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. Hindscarth stands in the southern sector. The principal ridge in this group of fells runs east from Buttermere, climbing over Robinson, Hindscarth and Dale Head. It then turns north, descending gradually toward Derwentwater, the main tops being High Spy, Maiden Moor and Catbells. The ridge from Robinson to Dale Head forms the heads of Little Dale and Newlands, bypassing the intervening summit of Hindscarth. This stands off to the north, forming the dividing wall between the two valleys. The long north-west ridge steps down over several tiers of crag to the confluence of its bordering streams. The southern face of Hindscarth looks down over Honister Pass. Ascents A popular ascent starts from a parking area nearby Newlands Church and passes over the Scope End ridge before continuing up crags to the summit. Due to their proximity, Hindscarth and Robinson are often combined into a single walk starting from Newlands. The fell is also part of a longer walk including Catbells, High Spy, Dale Head and along the Littledale Edge ridge to Robinson ‚Äî the Newlands horseshoe. Geology Hindscarth is an example of the Buttermere Formation, an olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Mining The northern ridge of Hindscarth which falls away to the Newlands valley has at its foot (at Scope End) one of the most famous former mines in the Lake District. The Goldscope mine has been designated as a major national important site by English Heritage who have stated that it should receive priority treatment for its protection and preservation. The mine was opened in 1564 and developed in its early days by German miners, who worked its rich veins of lead and copper. The mine was considered so important in its early days that it was requisitioned for the Crown by Elizabeth I from its then-owner, the Earl of Northumberland. There are considerable spoil heaps on the Newlands Beck side of Scope End and the shaft inside the hillside was sunk to such a considerable depth that it became uneconomical to pump out the water, leading to the closure of the mine at the end of the 19th century. Looking down the north ridge from the summit shelter to the Newlands Valley Summit The summit carries an untidy cairn amid some embedded rocks. Elsewhere there are patches of grass and gravel. A hundred yards south is a larger cairn, marked as a Shelter on Ordnance Survey maps. The view north into the Newlands Valley is excellent, backed by Skiddaw. All of the major fell groups with the exception of High Street can be seen.

The Norton people used flake-stone tools like their predecessors, the Arctic small tool tradition, but they were more marine-oriented and brought new technologies such as oil-burning lamps and clay vessels into use. Norton people used both marine and land resources as part of their subsistence strategy. They hunted caribou and smaller mammals as well as salmon and larger sea mammals. Their settlements were occupied fairly permanently, as is evidenced by village sites which contain substantial dwellings. During summer months, small camps may have been used as temporary hunting and fishing locations, but the main dwelling place was maintained and returned to at the end of the hunting season. in about 700 BC, the Norton inhabitants of the St. Lawrence and other Bering Strait Islands developed an even more specialized culture, based entirely on the ocean, called the Thule Tradition. Stages The Norton tradition is divided into three stages of development. The first, the Choris Stage (ca. 1600‚Äî500 BC), consists of coastal sites mostly in northwest Alaska containing fiber-tempered pottery with linear stamping decorating the outsides of the vessels. There is much local variation in this stage, which may indicate relative isolation of communities. The Choris people constructed sizable oval houses, hunted caribou and sea mammals and used Siberian-styled pottery. They may have expanded as far as the Mackenzie River Delta and Banks Island. The second stage, Norton (500 BC‚Äî800 AD), is distinguished by caribou (hunting) and fishing. There developed more refined pottery that included the Choris-style stamps, but also included check stamps applied using ivory paddles. New technology included stone lamps, stone working, asymmetrical knives, and ground stone projectile points made from slate. The final stage, the Ipiutak Stage (1‚Äî800 AD), was a more artistically developed form of the Norton Culture. Their technology was less advanced (no pottery, oil lamps, or slate artifacts), but they used elegant harpoon heads that were ornately adorned.

Name He was born Boe (Middle Persian: B≈çƒì, B≈çyah/B√ºyah), which is Hellenized as Boes. He is better known by his title of Wahrƒ´z (Middle Persian: w·∏•lyƒç; in Bahrƒ´z; in Greek: Ouarizes, in ; New Persian: ).  Biography  Wahrez is first mentioned in the prelude to the Iberian War, where he was sent by the Sasanian king (shah) Kavadh I (r. 498‚Äì531) to Caucasian Iberia in order to subdue a revolt under Gurgen.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deylamites#pt1 During the reign of Kavadh's son, Khosrau I, the Yemenites had requested assistance against Axum dominance, who had occupied large parts of the country. Sayf ibn Dhi- Yazan, the son of Dhu Yazan, went to Khosrau and offered him all of Yemen if his army would defeat the Axumites. \\"The arrow of old Wahraz kills Masruq, the Ethiopian King of Yemen\\", Persian miniature from Tarikh-i Bal'ami Khosrau then sent Wahrez and his son Nawzadh to Yemen at the head of a small expeditionary force, numbering around 800, of low-ranking Azatan (Azadan) nobility.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abna-term According to other traditions, it consisted of prisoners that were sentenced to death, while according to another version, the force also included (or entirely consisted of) warriors from Daylam and nearby regions. only two out of eight ships (i.e. 600 men) safely reached the Yemeni coast, who joined the local Himyarite allies and invaded the combined forces of the Aksumites, their Himyarite allies, and certain \\"Bedouins\\". During the invasion, Nawzadh was killed, which made Wahrez furious at Masruq ibn Abraha, the Axumite ruler of Yemen. Wahrez then met Masruq in battle and killed him with an arrow, which made the Axumites flee. He then conquered Sana'a, where he is known to have refused to lower his banner to enter via the city gate. Wahrez then restored Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan to his throne as a vassal of the Sasanian Empire. Al-Tabari reports that the main reason behind victory of Wahrez over the Axumites was the use of the panjagƒÅn (meaning \\"having five (arrows?) and probably a ballista equipped with heavy darts), a piece of military technology with which the local peoples were utterly unfamiliar. After having conquered Yemen, Wahrez then returned to Persia with a great amount of booty. However, in AD 575 or 578, the vassal king was killed by the Ethiopians, which forced Wahrez to return to Yemen with a force of 4000 men, and expel the Axumites once again. He then made Ma ødƒ´ Karib, the son of Sayf, the new king of Yemen. Wahrez was then appointed as governor of Yemen by Khosrau I, which would remain in Sasanian hands until the arrival of Islam. Wahrez was succeeded by his son MarzubƒÅn as governor of Yemen.

History  MOL subsidiary Slovnaft oil refinery in Bratislava = Foundation (1994‚Äì1995) = New polypropylene plant of Slovnaft in BratislavaOn 1 October 1991, MOL was established as a legal successor, merging nine former members of the National Oil and Gas Trust, which had been established in 1957. By 1995, the actual integration of companies was completed, and the previously separated entities started to operate within one joint organization. MOL decided on a privatization strategy, in order to respond to international market, political and legal challenges, which the company was facing following the turmoil of the end of the Soviet Union. It thus became a pioneer in the regional consolidation of the oil and gas industry. = Regional expansion (1995‚Äì2001) = In 1995, the company first expanded across national borders, opening filling stations in Transylvania, Romania. In the following years MOL continued to expand, and in 2000 acquired a 36% stake in Slovnaft, Slovakia's national oil company. The company thus became the first oil company in Central Europe to establish a cross-border partnership and also launched a new business branch by procuring 32.9% of Hungary's petrochemical company TVK. In 1999, MOL entered Pakistan, becoming the operator of TAL Block (with 8.42% stake in production), one of the largest hydrocarbon producing blocks of the country. = International expansion (2002‚Äì2007) = As a result of the 2002 INA Privatization Act, the open public tender for the privatization of a 25%+1 share stake in INA, Croatia's national oil company, was launched in May 2002. MOL won the tender with a bid of $505 million against OMV's offer of $420 million. By 2004, MOL had fully acquired, in several steps, Slovakia's national refiner Slovnaft, and Hungary's leading producer of ethylene and polypropylene TVK, over which MOL gained control with increasing their stake to 34.5% in 2001. Subsequently, MOL further increased its stake in TVK to 86.56% in 2006. In 2015, MOL then raised its shareholding in TVK to 100%. Between 2003 and 2005, MOL completed the acquisition of Shell Romania. In 2004, MOL entered the Austrian market by purchasing a fuel storage facility in Korneuburg, and a year later acquired the Roth filling station chain. In August 2007, MOL purchased Italiana Energia e Servizi S.p.A. (IES), owner of the Mantua refinery and a chain of 165 retail stations in Italy. = International expansion II (2007‚Äì2016) = In 2007, MOL entered the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, where its subsidiary MOL Kalegran owns 20% in Shaikan PSC. Further in 2009, MOL acquired a 10% stake in the Pearl Petroleum consortium (Pearl) from Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas PJSC. In November 2007, MOL reported a new regional initiative to create a joint regional gas pipeline system called New European Transmission System (NETS). On 20 December 2007, MOL announced a strategic cooperation with Czech power utility CEZ. The joint venture with CEZ focuses on gas-fired power generation and related gas infrastructure in Central and Southeastern Europe, first launching two 800 MW power plants in Hungary and Slovakia. After selling 7% of its shares to CEZ within the scopes of a strategic partnership, MOL announced on 10 March 2008 the sale of an 8% stake to the Oman Oil Company for the same reason. On 9 May 2008, MOL signed an agreement to acquire a 35% interest in a block in India operated by the Indian ONGC. In the same year MOL further acquired 22.16% of INA's shares through its general public offer on the Zagreb Stock Exchange. On 24 May 2011, the second Orb√°n-cabinet bought the Russian Surgutneftegas's shares, thus the Hungarian state acquired 21.2% of the shares within the company. In late 2013, MOL entered the North Sea by acquiring Wintershall‚Äôs portfolio, which included a mix of producing fields and undeveloped projects. It also acquired a position in the Scott hub in the central North Sea. MOL further expanded its exploration portfolio by entering Norway in 2015, after acquiring Ithaca Petroleum Norge. On May 8, 2014, MOL announced the acquisition of the Italian Eni‚Äôs subsidiaries in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania, including the retail network of 208 petrol stations previously operated under the Agip brand. The transaction also included the takeover of Eni's wholesale interests in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania. In the Czech Republic, MOL's retail market share exceeded 10 percent thanks to 125 new gas stations and 24 Slovnaft and 125 PAP Oil filling stations, also belonging to the group. With 274 service stations, the MOL Group is the second largest retailer of fuel in the country. In Slovakia, 253 petrol stations were already part of the entire network, with 41 filling stations purchased at the time. In Romania, the existing network expanded by 42 wells, adding 189 items, accounting for 12% of retail sales. = Diversification (2016‚Äìtoday) = In 2016, MOL announced its new long-term strategy MOL 2030 in response to expected fossil fuel peak demand. According to the company, its integrated upstream-downstream business model would continue to provide stable and robust profitability for the next 10-15 years, but new investments are seen to be essential for MOL‚Äôs future. As part of the strategy, the company intends to diversify the classical Oil & Gas business and develop into the region‚Äôs leading chemical and consumer goods and services company. According to Wall Street Journal, ‚ÄúMOL has a transformation plan that is among the most explicit responses to the trend, indicating how the landscape may change for big energy providers over the next decade.‚Äù Through 2030, MOL scheduled investments of US$4.5 billion to expand its petrochemical business and to extend away from the commodity segment into higher value-added chemical products. One of the first projects following the new strategy was the Polyol chemical project. In September 2018, MOL reached final investment on the project and signed engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts with ThyssenKrupp. In October 2019, the foundation stone for the complex in Tisza√∫jv√°ros, Hungary, was laid by Zsolt Hern√°di, Ferenc Koncz, Sami Pelkonen and Mih√°ly Varga. The plant is scheduled to be fully operational by 2021. As part of MOL 2030, the company has also begun to build up its recycling capabilities and formed a partnership for plastic recycling with German APK in 2018, and in 2019 acquired Aurora, a German recycled plastic compounding company. As part of its retail strategy, MOL aims to become a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) retailer and reshape the transportation in Central Eastern Europe. By 2030, the company's goal is to double its consumer services EBITDA (comparing to 2017) from 15% to 30%. In 2017, MOL launched fleet management, e-mobility and car sharing ventures. In September 2019, MOL Serbia opened a new fuel storage depot in Sremski Karlovci. With total investments in Serbia exceeding ‚Ç¨500 million, the facility will be used to store and process fuels for the currently 62 gas stations in the country. The compound is MOL‚Äôs largest investment into Serbia over the last 15 years. In the same month, more than 100 recently graduated young professionals from 18 nationalities started their career at MOL Group‚Äôs Growww program. In November 2019, MOL signed an agreement with Chevron, acquiring their 9.57% interest in the Azeri-Chirag- Gunashli (ACG) oil field, one of the world‚Äôs largest oil fields that is located in the Caspian Sea, and an 8.9% stake in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. The pipeline transports crude oil from ACG to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. The total transaction was valued at $1.57 billion.  Corporate affairs  = Organizational structure = MOL has many subsidiaries across all areas of its business operations. Its most important subsidiaries include Slovnaft, INA and MOL Group Italy. = Leadership structure = MOL Group's chief governing body is the board of directors, which has 10 members, out of which three are executive and seven are non-executive. The three executive members of the board are its Chairman Zsolt Hern√°di, who serves as Chief Executive Officer, J√≥zsef Moln√°r, Group Chief Executive Officer and Oszk√°r Vil√°gi, Group Innovative Businesses and Services Executive Vice President. The supervisory board is led by Zolt√°n √Åldott, who is also the chairman of the supervisory board of Slovnaft. = Shareholder structure = As of September 2019, MOL's current shareholder structure is: * 34.62% - Foreign investors (mainly institutional) *15.24% - Hungarian state (MNV Zrt.) *10.00% - Maecenas Universitatis Corvini Foundation *7.14% - OmanOil (Budapest) Limited *4.90% - OTP Bank Plc. *1.24% - OTP Fund Management *4.45% - ING Bank N.V. *3.31% - UniCredit Bank AG *0.65% - MUFG Securities EMEA Plc. *6.79% - Domestic institutional investors *3.58% - Domestic private investors *8.08% - MOL Plc. and MOL Investment Kft. (treasury shares) = MOL campus = In 2017, MOL announced the relocation of their corporate headquarters, which are currently based in various buildings throughout Budapest. The new building is called MOL Campus and will be erected in southern Budapest. The complex consists of a 120m tower, connected podium, buildings and outside spaces, which are designed by Foster + Partners. The campus also entails a public ‚Äúsky deck‚Äù and is planned with state-of-the-art sustainability features, including responsive lighting, heating and ventilation systems, low-carbon energy sources and rainwater harvesting and storage facilities. The campus will span 86,000 sqm at the bank of the Danube and accommodate up to 2,500 people. The tower will be Budapest's highest building and make it the second city in the CEE region to display a building by the British studio. In October 2018, the cornerstone was laid, and the campus is expected to be finished by 2021. In June 2019, MOL revealed first interior design visualizations, that were created by the Berlin-based interior design company KINZO. Operations MOL Eco solar powered filling station in Budapest, Hungary =International upstream operations= MOL Group has a current Upstream presence in 13 countries with production activities in 8. Besides Central and Eastern Europe (Hungary and Croatia), its core regions, MOL has a presence and partnerships in the CIS region (Russia, Kazakhstan), the Middle East, Africa and Pakistan as well as the North Sea region (UK, Norway). The group's total oil and gas reserves stood at of oil equivalent at the end of 2017 and the daily average hydrocarbon production is per day of oil equivalent. MOL derives nearly three- quarters of its oil and gas production from Hungary and Croatia. Despite the fact that the fields in the CEE are mature, the company has managed to reverse a production decline, with oil production growing by 20% in 2016 thanks to optimization measures (Enhanced Oil Recovery). The company has a 20% interest in the Catcher area oil and gas block in the North Sea, in company with Premier Oil (50%) and Cairn Energy (30%). In June 2014, the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change gave final approval for the ¬£1 billion development. First oil was achieved from the field's FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) in December 2017. Norway plays an important role in MOL Group's international exploration portfolio. The company entered Norway in 2015, after acquiring Ithaca Petroleum Norge, and is present in three of the North Sea's core areas (Central Graben South, South Viking Graben and Northern North Sea). In late 2018, MOL Norge started its first operated drilling in the Oppdal/Driva prospect. MOL has foreign exploration licences in (with date of announcement): *Yemen, Exploration Blocks ‚Äô48‚Äô and ‚Äô49‚Äô, 2002 *Kazakhstan, Federovskoye Block, 2004 ; North Karpovsky, 2012 *Croatia and Hungary, Slatina and Zal√°ta, 2006 *Russia, Baituganskoe Oilfield, Surgut-7 block and Matjushkinsky block 2006‚Äì2007 *Cameroon, Ngosso Permit Block, 2007 *Iraq, Akri Bijeel Block, 2007 MOL has foreign production facilities in (with date of announcement): *Russia, Zapadno-Malobalyk oil field (with Yukos, later Russneft) 2002 *Pakistan, Tal Block, 2004 = Downstream operations = fuel station in Transylvania, Romaniaalt= MOL Group operates assets with a total of 20.9 mtpa refining and 2.2 mtpa petrochemicals capacity. Its downstream asset base includes 6 production units: 4 refineries and 2 petrochemical sites, and an extended regional logistics and wholesales network as an integrated value chain. Its refineries at Sz√°zhalombatta, Hungary and Bratislava, Slovakia, are among the most profitable ones in Europe, with Nelson complexity indexes of 10,6 and 11,5 respectively. MOL also produces and sells petrochemicals worldwide and is a leading petrochemical company in the Central Eastern Europe region. Its products are sold in more than 40 countries. MOL's petrochemical portfolio consists of high-quality polyolefin products (high- and low-density polyethylene, polypropylene) as well as butadiene. As part of its 2030 strategy, MOL targets a gradual increase of the share of valuable non-motor fuel products to above 50% by 2030 from below 30% currently. MOL intends to increase the feedstock for its petrochemical plants, whilst also taking advantage of the growing demand for profitable products as jet fuel, lubricants and base oils. As MOL aims to expand its petrochemical business, the company has earmarked EUR 1.2bn for investment in propylene- oxide based polyols, a high-value product applied in the automotive industry, packaging and furniture manufacturing. In 2018, it made a final investment decision on its Polyol Project, the biggest single investment of the company until 2021. To expand their petrochemical portfolio, MOL has signed a partnership with German APK in 2018, supporting the completion of APK's plastic-recycling plant in Merseburg. As part of circular-economy and sustainability endeavors, the plant pilots a process dubbed ‚ÄúNewcycling‚Äù, recovering high-quality materials from plastic waste. For the natural gas division, the main focus is gas transmission via an extensive high pressure gas pipeline, which length exceeds . MOL is a member of the Nabucco Pipeline project. In the field of renewable energy MOL develops geothermal power production through the, CEGE Central European Geothermal Energy Production, a partnership with Australian-based Green Rock Energy Limited. The company supports the research of second generation biofuels at the University of Pannonia. = Consumer Services (Retail) = As of 2018, MOL Group owns a network of nearly 2,000 service stations under six brands across nine countries in Central Eastern Europe: Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Romania, Czech Republic, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. In reaction to advancements in technology and new consumer habits, and to prepare the company for times beyond the fuel age, the company has set the goal to become a broader goods and services provider. To reach these goals, MOL has already ventured into new businesses, including e-mobility, car sharing and fleet management, leveraging its 10 million retail customer base. As part of their 2030 strategy, MOL also focuses on e-mobility and alternative fuels. In 2018, the company launched a new car-sharing service in Budapest, MOL Limo.  Awards  At the 2016 Petroleum Economist Awards, MOL Group was named the Downstream Company of the Year and in 2018, it was awarded the Energy Company of the Year ‚Äì Mid Cap prize.  Controversies  = Takeover attempt by OMV = In June 2007, Austrian energy company OMV made an unsolicited bid to take over MOL, which has been rejected by the Hungarian company. On 6 March 2008, the European Commission launched an in-depth investigation of OMV's unsolicited bid to take over MOL. On 24 June 2008, OMV received a 'Statement of Objections' from the European Commission regarding the company's attempted takeover of MOL. In March 2009, OMV sold its 21% stake in MOL to Surgutneftegas. MOL called this move \\"unfriendly\\" and claimed OMV had acted as a front for Russian interests. = Surgutneftegas shares = Following the OMV's sale of its 21% stake of MOL to Surgutneftgas in 2009, MOL refused to register the Russian company as a shareholder with full rights, due to non- transparent ownership structure of Surgutneftegas. As a result, Surgutneftegas did not have its representatives in the board and the right to vote at general assemblies of shareholders. MOL defended its decision to block Surgut by arguing that the Russian company had not made its intentions towards the company clear. In May 2011, the Hungarian government bought the Russian Surgutneftegas's shares, thus the Hungarian state acquired 21.2% of the shares of MOL. = Legal dispute over INA = In 2011, Croatia started an investigation of ex-prime minister Ivo Sanader for allegedly accepting a ‚Ç¨10 million bribe from MOL, in exchange for the Croatian Government approving the First Amendment to the Shareholders Agreement and thus MOL securing management rights, accusing also the company's chairman, Zsolt Hern√°di. MOL repeatedly denied all the accusations. Soon after, the Hungarian prosecution launched investigation on suspicion of bribery and in 2012 dismissed allegations of criminal activity in this matter.

It is in the north of Leicestershire, and north-east of Loughborough. The village has a population of about 1,000, measured at 1,296 in the 2011 census. It is close to Prestwold and Burton on the Wolds in Leicestershire, and the Nottinghamshire villages of Rempstone and Willoughby on the Wolds. A William Charles gravestone in Wymeswold churchyard History and geography There used to be a school in the village run by Thomas Potter in the nineteenth century on Elm Street.\\"Thomas Rossell Potter\\" in Dictionary of National Biography now in the public domain The school was moved to a site to the south of the village when it expanded in the 1970s. The village was formerly the site of RAF Wymeswold, a memorial to which can be seen on the wall of Wymeswold pharmacy remembers when a Wellington bomber on a night training exercise crashed up on a hill nearby, just two miles from the airfield, on 25 November 1943. Six crew members died at the scene and a seventh died of his injuries three days later; the trainee rear gunner was the sole survivor. The Wymeswold airstrip still remains, although disused, is now used as a track for performance car 'experience' days, although there is some local opposition to this because of the noise. The former airfield is also the home for Airbossworld Kitepark. In 1939 a YHA youth Hostel opened in Wymeswold and subsequently shut in 1946. The village has a greengrocer and general store, specialised pine furniture and gift shop, two pubs (The Three Crowns and The Windmill) and a restaurant (Hammer and Pincers). The Three Crowns was CAMRA Loughborough and North Leicestershire 2010 Village Pub of the Year. There are many clubs and societies within the village, including WHO (Wymeswold Historical Organisation), Guide and Scout groups, dancing, aerobics and karate classes, and bowls, cricket, cycling, and football clubs. The village holds two very successful fund raising events in the summer‚Äî the Wymeswold Duck Race (mid May) and the Wymeswold Open Gardens (mid June). Wymeswold Running Club organises the 'Waddle', a 5-mile road race on closed roads, to take place on the same day as the Duck Race. The post office was closed in May 2008, as part of the Royal Mail's restructuring. An outreach service has been opened in The Three Crowns. At the southern edge of the village, the 'Washdyke' recreational area contains play equipment, a BMX track, football pitch, and a community orchard. St Mary's Church St Mary's church was restored in 1844 by A. W. N. Pugin. It contains the Leeke memorial to Judge William Leeke who was Lord of the Manor of Wymeswold in the mid-17th century. His widow presented the church with a silver flagon and paten that are now in the Charnwood museum. The remarkable windows were the work of John Hardman Studios, Birmingham. The churchyard contains one of the best collections of Swithland slate headstones to be seen. The village was a centre of Swithland slate carving and home to the fine slate craftsmen, William Charles, the Winfields and Roworth. Henry Alford was the Vicar of Wymeswold from 1835 to 1853 and wrote many of his hymns here. References 5\\\\. Neal, Tim; Neal, Simon (1993). Youth Hostels of England and Wales 1931-1993.

Thoughtography, also called projected thermography, psychic photography, nengraphy, and nensha , is the claimed ability to \\"burn\\" images from one's mind onto surfaces such as photographic film by psychic means. While the term \\"thoughtography\\" has been in the English lexicon since 1913, the more recent term \\"projected thermography\\" is a neologism popularized in the 2002 U.S. film The Ring, a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ring. History Thoughtography (also known as psychic photography) first emerged in the late 19th century due to the influence of spirit photography. Thoughtography has no connection with Spiritualism, which distinguishes it from spirit photography. One of the first books to mention \\"psychic photography\\" was the book The New Photography (1896) by Arthur Brunel Chatwood. In the book Chatwood described experiments where the \\"image of objects on the retina of the human eye might so affect it that a photograph could be produced by looking at a sensitive plate.\\"Arthur Brunel Chatwood. (1896). The New Photography. Downey. p. 93 The book was criticized in a review in Nature.Norman Lockyer. (1896). Nature. Volume 53. p. 460 The psychical researcher Hereward Carrington in his book Modern Psychical Phenomena (1919) wrote that many psychic photographs were revealed to be fraudulent produced by substitution and manipulation of the plates, double- printing, double-exposure and chemical screens. However, Carrington also stated he believed some of the photographs to be genuine. The term \\"thoughtography\\" was first introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century by Tomokichi Fukurai. Skeptics, among them professional photographers, consider psychic photographs to be faked or the result of flaws in the camera or film, exposures, film-processing errors, lens flares, flash reflections or chemical reactions. Claims =Tomokichi Fukurai= Around 1910, during a period of interest in Spiritualism in Japan, Tomokichi Fukurai, an assistant professor of psychology at Tokyo University began pursuing parapsychology experiments using Chizuko Mifune, Ikuko Nagao, and others as subjects. Fukurai published results of experiments with Nagao that alleged she was capable of telepathically imprinting images on photo plates, which he called nensha. When journalists found irregularities, Nagao's credibility was attacked, and there was speculation that her later illness and death was caused by distress over criticism. In 1913, Fukurai published Clairvoyance and Thoughtography. The book was criticized for a lack of scientific approach and his work disparaged by the university and his colleagues. Fukurai eventually resigned in 1913. =Eva Carri√®re= Carri√®re with fake ectoplasm made from the French magazine Le Miroir. In the early 20th century the psychical researcher Albert von Schrenck-Notzing investigated the medium Eva Carri√®re and claimed her ectoplasm \\"materializations\\" were the result of \\"ideoplasty\\" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind. Schrenck-Notzing published the book Phenomena of Materialisation (1923) which included photographs of the ectoplasm. Critics pointed out the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string. Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carri√®re deceptively smuggled pins into the s√©ance room. The magician Carlos Mar√≠a de Heredia replicated the ectoplasm of Carri√®re using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief. Donald West wrote that the ectoplasm of Carri√®re was fake and was made of cut- out paper faces from newspapers and magazines on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carri√®re taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters \\"Le Miro\\". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.West, Donald. (1954). Psychical Research Today. Chapter S√©ance-Room Phenomena. Duckworth. p. 49 Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carri√®re's ectoplasm faces. Cut out faces that she used included Woodrow Wilson, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, French president Raymond Poincar√© and the actress Mona Delza. After Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carri√®re had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm. Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous. Joseph McCabe wrote \\"In Germany and Austria, Baron von Schrenck- Notzing is the laughing-stock of his medical colleagues.\\" =Ted Serios= In the 1960s, it was claimed that Chicago resident Ted Serios, a hotel bellhop in his late forties, used psychokinetic powers to produce images on Polaroid instant film. Serios's psychic claims were bolstered by the endorsement of a Denver-based psychiatrist, Jule Eisenbud (1908‚Äì1999), who wrote a book, The World of Ted Serios: \\"Thoughtographic\\" Studies of an Extraordinary Mind (1967), arguing that Serios's purported psychic abilities were genuine. However, professional photographers and skeptics found that Serios was employing simple sleight of hand. =Masuaki Kiyota= Masuaki Kiyota is a Japanese psychic who was claimed to possess psychokinetic powers. Kiyota was tested by investigators in London by Granada Television and the results were negative. It was discovered that with tight controls, Kiyota was unable to project mental images onto film. He could only achieve success when he had the film in his possession without any control for at least 2 hours. According to magician and skeptic James Randi \\"Kiyota's Polaroid photos were apparently produced by preexposing the film, since it was noted that he made great efforts to obtain a film pack and spend time with it in private.\\" In a 1984 television interview, Kiyota confessed to fraud. Alt URL =Uri Geller= In 1995, famed psychic Uri Geller began to use a 35 mm camera in his performances. The lens cap left on the camera, Geller would take pictures of his forehead and then have the pictures developed. Geller claimed that subsequent images had come directly from his mind. James Randi claimed Geller had performed the trick by using a \\"handheld optical device\\" or by taking photographs on already exposed film. References Further reading *Hereward Carrington. (1921).

It is one of three high schools in the Pearland Independent School District, and serves parts of Pearland and most of the city of Brookside Village. U.S. News & World Report ranks it 242nd in Texas and 2,689th nationally. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. Background and history Prior to the school's establishment in 1937, Pearland students had to attend secondary school in Webster. The first graduating class in 1938 included valedictorian was Beatrice Woods who would become Beatrice Woods Theriot after marrying Melvin Theriot. The original Pearland School, opened in 1937, had a staff of about 12 people and served 58 students in 1st through 12th grades on Grand Boulevard. In 1953, the campus moved to Galveston Avenue, and the Grand Boulevard school became Pearland Elementary (later C.J. Harris Elementary). In 1991, the high school moved again, to Main Street (SH 35). The Galveston Avenue property is now home to the Pearland Historical Society, a Brazoria County Tax Office annex, Pearland Junior High School West Campus, and Leon H. Sablatura Middle School. The school's mascot is the \\"Oiler Man\\" or \\"Oiler\\". In contrast to the local legend, the mascot was not inspired by the Houston Oilers professional football team (the school was established 25 years before the team). Instead it is a tribute to an important sector of the local and regional economy. Several local businesses in Pearland are related to the oil industry, including a helicopter service that ferries people to nearby off-shore oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The current Pearland High School campus opened in 1991, on South Main Street. The original building (called the South Campus) has a capacity of 2,200 students. The building houses the auditorium, 2 gymnasiums (one was converted into a weight room), several vocational trades shops, and the athletic locker rooms. In 1998, a 1,750 student capacity building was built adjacent to Pearland High School. This building houses three gymnasiums, a teaching theater, a broadcast studio, and a large cafeteria. This building was called the \\"North Campus\\" until being renamed for the late Sheryl Searcy, a longtime reading teacher at Pearland High School in 2009. Glenda Dawson High School opened in 2007, relieving the overcrowded Pearland High School. The school's marching band performed in the 2020 Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA on New Year's Day.

The film premiered on September 10, 2002 at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was commercially released in China ten days later. Written by Chen Kaige and Xue Xiaolu, the plot revolves around a thirteen-year-old violin prodigy Liu Xiaochun and his father Liu Cheng who move to Beijing from a small southern town. It is Liu Cheng's biggest dream that Xiaochun may find a good teacher in the city and rise to stardom. After studying under two teachers, however, the boy finds that he has learned not just music, but what is really important in life. Plot Liu Cheng (Liu Peiqi) is a widowed cook making his living in a small southern town in China. His thirteen-year-old son, Liu Xiaochun (Tang Yun), is a violin prodigy. In the hope that Xiaochun might find success as a violinist, Liu Cheng and Xiaochun travel to Beijing to participate in a competition organized by the Children's Palace, an arts institution for school children. Even though Xiaochun emerges fifth, he is denied admission into the conservatory as he does not have Beijing residency. Determined to realize his hopes for Xiaochun, Liu Cheng persuades Professor Jiang (Wang Zhiwen), a stubborn and eccentric teacher from the Children's Palace, to take Xiaochun as a private student. In the subsequent days, Xiaochun makes friends with Lili (Chen Hong), a young and attractive woman living upstairs. Lili does not have a regular job but lives off the rich men she dates. However, her heart lies with Hui (Cheng Qian), her smooth-talking, cheating boyfriend. After Lili finds out about Hui's affairs in the presence of Xiaochun, Xiaochun sells his violin to a shop, buys a fur coat that Lili fancies, and leaves it at Lili's apartment for her to find. Unfortunately, Hui finds the gift before Lili does, and gives it to Lili, claiming that it was from him. Lili does not discover that Hui lied (and that the coat was from Xiaochun) until later. Meanwhile, Liu Cheng has learned about a Professor Yu Shifeng (Chen Kaige), a high- profile professor from the Central Conservatory of Music. Believing that Professor Yu is able to bring Xiaochun to fame and success, Liu Cheng decides to switch teachers for Xiaochun. He pays Professor Yu a visit and confides in the latter the truth about Xiaochun's birth. It turns out that Liu Cheng has never been married. He found the infant Xiaochun abandoned in a train station, a violin placed next to the baby. Liu Cheng brought both home and raised the baby as his own. Xiaochun turned out to be a child prodigy, and Liu Cheng resolved to devote his life to cultivate his adopted son's talent. Professor Yu, apparently unmoved, nonetheless agrees to give Xiaochun an audition. However, Liu Cheng arrives at Professor Yu's home with Xiaochun only to find the violin case empty. Xiaochun, angry at his father for choosing commercial success over music, refuses to play even when offered another violin. Liu Cheng is so enraged that upon returning home, he tears up the award certificates that Xiaochun won in previous competitions. Lili, remorseful over the affair of the fur coat, looks up Professor Yu and persuades him to give Xiaochun a second chance. This time Xiaochun plays, and an impressed Professor Yu accepts him without hesitation. Professor Yu has another talented young student, Lin Yu (Zhang Jing), a highly jealous and ambitious girl. When a selection trial for an international competition is coming up, Lin Yu and Xiaochun are in a contest for the only spot. Liu Cheng decides to pack up and return home first, both to allow Xiaochun full concentration and to raise some money should Xiaochun be selected to participate in the international competition. In an effort to infuse passion and emotion into Xiaochun's playing, Professor Yu tells the boy the truth about his birth. However, this only strengthens Xiaochun's love for his father. Just before the selection trial, Xiaochun, who has been chosen to participate, relinquishes his spot to Lin Yu after she reveals to him that Professor Yu had secretly bought Xiaochun's original violin from the shop to stop Xiaochun from being distracted by thoughts of it. Xiaochun then takes the violin and runs after his father. The two finally reunite at the train station. In place of fame and success, Xiaochun chooses to be together with his father.

The company was incorporated in February 1983. Initially, they produced simple peripherals such as an RS-232 to Centronics parallel printer interface adapter. Later, they designed the Expanderam series of RAM expansion cards for the QL, which led to the Trump Card combined RAM expansion and floppy disk interface. This was notable in that it mapped RAM into memory space reserved for external peripheral devices, thus allowing the QL's RAM to be expanded to 768 kB rather than the official limit of 512 kB. The Trump Card was later superseded by the Gold Card processor upgrade card. This replaced the QL's 68008 CPU with a 16 MHz 68000 and included 2 MB of RAM, a floppy disk interface (supporting DD, HD, and ED density 3.5 in drives) and a non-volatile real-time clock. Gold Card plugged into the QL expansion slot and required no internal modifications to the host QL. The follow-up Super Gold Card had a 24 MHz 68020 CPU, 4MB of RAM, and added a Centronics parallel printer interface. In 1993, Miracle launched the QXL QL emulator card for PCs. This comprised a 20 MHz (later 25 MHz) 68EC040 processor, up to 8 MB of RAM and an FPGA on an ISA card. The QXL ran the SMSQ Qdos-compatible operating system and used the host PC's disks, screen, keyboard, serial and parallel ports via an MS-DOS \\"server\\". Two QLAN-compatible network ports were also provided on the QXL card. The company was finally wound up in August 2004.

It is situated in the Parish of Easebourne, just east of Midhurst, West Sussex standing on the north bank of the River Rother. It was largely destroyed by fire on 24 September 1793, but the ruins have nevertheless been Grade I listed.  Manor House  The original fortified manor house was built between 1273 and 1284 by Sir John Bohun across the river from the town of Midhurst. He named it Coudreye, the Norman word for the nearby hazel woods.  16th century  Painting of Cowdray House circa 1790 before its decay. In the 1520s, Sir David Owen, uncle to Henry VII began construction of the current Cowdray House on the site of the former home Coudreye which he had acquired upon the death of his wife Mary Bohun in 1496. In 1529, Sir David's son, Henry, sold the estate of Cowdray to Sir William Fitzwilliam. In 1533 Henry VIII granted a licence to Fitzwilliam's trustees to inpark of meadow, pasture and wood and build fortifications at \\"Cowdry\\". In 1536, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Sir William was given the nearby Easebourne Priory and other properties, whilst in 1538 his half-brother and heir who later inherited Cowdray, Anthony Browne, received Battle Abbey. It is rumoured that a dispossessed monk from Battle cursed the family and house by fire and water, thy line shall come to an end and it shall perish out of this land. Henry VIII made three visits to the house during his reign, in August 1538, July 1539 and August 1545. Mary of Guise, widow of James V of Scotland stayed a night at Cowdray in October 1551. The house was also visited by Edward VI in July 1552 and by his sister Elizabeth I in August 1591. The speeches and entertainments for Elizabeth were printed later in the year.The Speeches and Honourable Entertainment Given to the Queenes Majestie in Progresse, at Cowdrey in Sussex, by the Right Honourable the Lord Montacute, 1591 (London, 1591): Michael Questier, Catholicism and Community in Early-Modern England (Cambridge, 2006), pp. 170-174: Elizabeth Heale, 'Contesting Terms' in J. E. Archer & E. Goldring & S. Knight edd., The Progresses, Pageants, & Entertainments of Queen Elizabethe I (Oxford, 2007), pp. 199-204 In November 1538, the last surviving member of the House of Plantagenet, Lady Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury was imprisoned at Cowdray until September 1539. She was the niece of Richard III, last Plantagenet King who died at Bosworth Field in 1485. She was removed to the Tower of London. and was executed in May 1541. In 1548 Anthony Browne's son, Sir Anthony Browne inherited Cowdray, he was later ennobled as the 1st Viscount Montague upon the marriage of Queen Mary to King Philip of Spain. Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton (1573‚Äì1624), courtier and literary patron, was born at Cowdray House near Midhurst in Sussex on 6 October 1573. He was the third child and only surviving son of Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, and his wife, Mary Browne, daughter of the first Viscount Montagu. Wriothesley is famous as the dedicatee of Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and Lucrece, and the likely inspiration for the 'fair youth' of Shakespeare's Sonnets.  17th century  Cowdray Ruins In 1592 the 1st Viscount's grandson Anthony-Maria Browne inherited Cowdray. During his ownership of Cowdray, Guy Fawkes was briefly employed as a footman and the 2nd Viscount was briefly imprisoned for complicity in the Gunpowder plot after staying away from Parliament on 5 November 1605 following a warning. In the mid-1630s Robert May was employed as a cook at Cowdray House. During the English Civil War two thirds of the Cowdray estate were sequestered from Francis Browne, 3rd Viscount Montagu, and the house was garrisoned by Parliamentary forces. There are marks on the walls of the main courtyard of the house thought to be from musketballs fired by soldiers during this time.  18th century  In 1770, under the ownership of the 7th Viscount Montague, Capability Brown was employed to modernise the gardens. On 24 September 1793, during restoration work, a fire started in the carpenters' workshop in the North Gallery where some smouldering charcoal was allowed to fall upon the sawdust and woodshavings strewn across the floor. During the restoration work the family's furniture and treasures had also been stored in the North Gallery to make re-decorating easier. From the collection only three paintings and a few small pieces of furniture were saved, the rest including artefacts from Battle Abbey being devoured by flames. Less than two weeks later, the 8th Viscount Montague perished whilst trying to ride the Rhine Falls and the title passed to a descendant of the 2nd Viscount, Mark Browne who later died childless and the peerage became extinct. These two events marked the conclusion of the supposed curse set upon the family 250 years earlier. The estate was inherited by the 8th Viscount's sister and by marriage William Stephen Poyntz.  19th and 20th centuries  West view of the Ruins of Cowdray House, Sussex, John Buckler, John Chessell Buckler During the early 19th century the house was left to ruin; it was quickly colonised by plants, most notably ivy, which hastened its decay. Small alterations were made to the surviving Kitchen Tower such as a floor being put in above the kitchens, though it was not inhabited. Following the death of William Poyntz the estate passed to his three daughters, but they could not decide how to divide the estate and it was eventually sold to the 6th Earl of Egmont in 1843. In 1908 the 8th Earl of Egmont sold the estate to Sir Weetman Dickinson Pearson, becoming Baron Cowdray of Midhurst and later in 1917 became the 1st Viscount Cowdray. The Viscount put a halt to the decay, arranging for the careful removal of the ivy, the restoration of any unsafe structures and a full survey of the ruins to be completed.  21st century  The house remains under the ownership of the Viscount Cowdray, currently residing with the 4th Viscount Cowdray who inherited it in 1995. Following a major preservation/conservation project in 2006 the ruins were opened to visitors on 31 March 2007. Cowdray House featured largely in Anya Seton's 1972 historical romance Green Darkness.

A mystical entity, he is the deity that powers Juggernaut through the artifact known as Crimson Gem of Cyttorak. Publication history Created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Alex Toth, Cyttorak was first mentioned in Strange Tales I #124 (September 1964), a temple molded in his image was seen in X-Men #12 (July 1965), and actually appeared in Doctor Strange Sorcerer Supreme #44 (August 1992). Fictional character biography Cyttorak existed as a deity (or demon) who received worship on Earth until, under unknown circumstances, he was banished from the Earth. He took up residence in a dimension known as the Crimson Cosmos, where time did not pass. Cyttorak has existed since the time of the ancient sorceress Morgan le Fay (during the Seventh Century), and even then offered his magic to his worshippers for power, as shown when Morgan used the Crimson Bands to easily bind Dr. Strange and Bolar. Approximately one thousand years ago, a gathering of eight great magical beings took place. These beings ‚Äì Balthakk, Farallah, Ikonn, Krakkan, Raggadorr, Valtorr, Watoomb, and Cyttorak ‚Äì disagreed as to who had the greatest power. Hence, they settled on the Wager of the Octessence. Each being created an artifact with a fraction of their respective power, which would transform the first human who made physical contact with it into an Exemplar, a living personification of the power. Using outside agents, to construct temples to house the artifacts, the magical beings planned that the first mortal to find the artifact would trigger a spell that would quickly draw others to the remaining artifacts, creating eight Exemplars. Then would come the Ceremony of the Octessence, where a gathering of the Exemplars would attend the construction of a great magical engine, which would overwhelm the wills of all human beings. After the enslavement of humanity, each Exemplar would rule an eighth of humanity, with, subsequently, a war between all Exemplars, in which only one would be left standing. Cyttorak managed to build a temple in a Southeast Asian country. He had a thrall demon named Xorak protect this temple for him. At some point in the past, the great adept the Ancient One encountered and engaged in battle with Xorak near Cyttorak's temple. \\"Centuries ago\\" (possibly before or after the aforementioned battle between the Ancient One and Xorak), a group of renegade monks tried to summon Cyttorak but instead brought his \\"most destructive aspect\\" to Southeast Asia. An adept named Gomurr, who served as the apprentice to \\"one of the most disreputable conjurers on the continent\\" opposed this avatar of Cyttorak. Gomurr received the aid of Tar, his friendly rival, as well as an \\"Initiate of the Ebon Vein\\". Gomurr and Tar, collaborating, succeeded in forcing this aspect of Cyttorak within the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak. Tar later attained the title of the \\"Proctor of the Crimson Dawn\\", but Gomurr would later hold this office. Cyttorak was last seen being released from a magical prison by Pete Wisdom during the Skrull invasion of Otherworld. Shortly after the \\"Maximum Carnage\\" storyline, Spider-Man encountered two malevolent demons in the form of masks while investigating the ruins of Doctor Strange's townhouse.Spectacular Spider-Man #207 Calling themselves the Screaming Masks of Cyttorak, they claimed to be familiars of Cytorrak who fed on fear and anguish. The hero defeated them with the aid of the heroic vigilante Shroud, and trapped them in a block of cement; the hero claimed he would \\"bury it somewhere\\" until he found Strange, but they were not mentioned again.Spectacular Spider-Man #208 During the Fear Itself storyline, Magik took herself, Colossus, and Kitty Pryde to the Crimson Cosmos to speak to Cyttorak. They inform Cyttorak that Juggernaut has been transformed into Kuurth: Breaker of Stone and is under the control of the Serpent. Colossus makes a bargain with Cyttorak to gain the power to stand against Kuurth.Uncanny X-Men #542 Cyttorak agrees to the terms and Colossus becomes the new avatar of the Juggernaut and is able to push Cain Marko back until Cain is summoned by the Serpent.Uncanny X-Men #543 Cyttorak later attended the Devil's Advocacy where he fiercely spoke out against the Serpent's actions on Earth where he took control of Cain Marko.Journey Into Mystery #627 During the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, Cyttorak wasn't pleased that a fragment of the Phoenix Force has possessed Colossus. Colossus tries to force the release of him being a Juggernaut with the Phoenix Force's power, but Cyttorak easily quells Colossus' attempt at freedom and tells him he will tolerate this infraction for now and teleports him out of the Crimson Cosmos.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 2 #15 Recently, Magik banishes the Juggernaut powers from Colossus.Uncanny X-Men Vol. 2 #20 Through a miniature portal generated by Man-Thing, Cyttorak detected Cain Marko's presence and granted him the powers of Juggernaut once again.Dark Avengers Vol. 2 #182 Avatars of Cyttorak =First Avatar= Jin Taiko Jin Taiko was Cyttorak's avatar before Cain Marko. When Taiko refused to destroy a village at the behest of Cyttorak, the ruler of the Crimson Cosmos and the supplier of Taikos's powers took his powers away until Cain Marko eventually found the gem and took over as Cyttorak's new avatar. Cain, as the new Juggernaut, faced and killed Jin Taiko, burning the village to the ground.New Excalibur #15 =Second Avatar= Cain Marko Temple of Cyttorak During the Korean War, an American soldier named Cain Marko hid in a cave to avoid an attack by the enemy. A fellow soldier, his stepbrother Charles Xavier, followed him in to convince him to rejoin the battle and avoid a court-martial (the inevitable result if his actions were to reach the attention of the commanding officers). The learned Xavier recognized that the cave contained the Temple of Cyttorak. Marko saw a ruby, remarking that it appeared to be living. He picked it up, despite Xavier's warning, to read the now famous inscription: \\"Whosoever touches this gem shall possess the power of the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become forevermore a human juggernaut!\\" Cain's transformation began as the Koreans' constant shelling of the cave caused it to collapse. Xavier escaped, but Marko also survived due to his new-found powers. Probably the destruction of the Temple of Cyttorak and the subsequent incapacitation of the Juggernaut served to throw a monkey wrench in the Wager. No other Exemplars would appear until years later, after the Juggernaut had clawed his way through the rubble, made his way to America, and battled the X-Men led by Xavier several times. Also, Marko, unlike the other Exemplars when they were created, did not initially lose his will to his power source, but retained his full individuality. In an Infinity War crossover, Doctor Strange travels through the dimensional corridors with Galactus and other allies. One of many anomalies drew their spaceship into conflict with Cyttorak. Galactus' ally Nova is captured by the entity; he desires worship. Juggernaut had been transported to Cyttorak's dimension and awoke to find Doctor Strange surrounded and nearly impaled by crimson crystals. Juggernaut uses his power to destroy the ever-growing crystals and saves Dr. Strange from certain death. Strange had summoned Juggernaut due to his ties to Cyttorak. Though low on actual power, Juggernaut promised to try to convince the entity to let them leave. When Dr. Strange and Juggernaut stumble upon Cyttorak's throne room, it is Strange who tries the diplomatic approach. Juggernaut has one thing on his mind at that point, and that is getting his hands on the ruby that is on Cyttorak's forehead. Just as Doctor Strange convinced Cyttorak to let them go, Juggernaut attacked the entity, knocking him down and taking the gemstone from his forehead. Thinking the ruby would give him unlimited power, he decided to test it out by smashing Strange's skull with it. What Juggernaut did not realize was that the ruby was draining his power. Since the entity his power flows from was dying he was only weakening himself. Finally, with Cyttorak in his weakened state, Nova is able to escape from the crimson bands that were holding her prisoner and able to blast the ruby right out of Juggernaut's hands. Strange then uses his magic to place the ruby back into the forehead of Cyttorak who instantly awakens and ensnares Juggernaut within the crimson bands. The entity is convinced that letting the Juggernaut operate on Earth, and leaving Dr. Strange and Nova to spread his great name across the universe, is enough to satiate his need for adulation and worship. His captives are returned to their respective places (Juggernaut on Earth, Strange and Nova on Galactus's ship).Dr. Strange III #44 (August 1992) The Juggernaut, having been attacked by Onslaught earlier, was placed in the Crimson Cosmos. Doctor Strange discovered this. Within the gem, a demoness called Spite showed Marko an illusion where Cain was crippled before he gained the Juggernaut powers, but Gomurr the Ancient freed Marko from this false scenario. Gomurr had Cain relive the latter‚Äôs past, as a delinquent child and his causing the accident that killed his father, Dr. Kurt Marko. Spite, however, again projected to the Juggernaut illusions to persuade him to stay in the Crimson Cosmos. Spite, however, had simply manipulated Marko. Cyttorak desired to inhabit Cain's body and leave his dimension. Cyttorak and Cain battled each other. Cyttorak brutalized Cain severely, but Cain chose not to surrender. Gomurr and his friend Tar arranged things so that Juggernaut could now utilize Cyttorak's power against him. Cain defeated Cyttorak and exited the Crimson Cosmos with more vitality than before. When certain charlatans had attempted to steal the Juggernaut‚Äôs power by using a false second gem of Cyttorak, the Juggernaut attempted to reabsorb his power from this second gem. However, he somehow was possessed by Cyttorak in the process. A being named Ejulp, dispatched by Juggernaut's confederate Black Tom, teleported the X-Men to aid the Juggernaut. Juggernaut's power was so heightened that he began shearing through dimensional boundaries. In this dimension, when Professor X and Wolverine made physical contact with each other, Xavier merged into Logan‚Äôs body. Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde returned to find a larger Juggernaut tearing through a dimensional wall. When Wolverine leaped into the mouthpiece of Juggernaut's headpiece, Logan and Xavier separated from one another. They found an entity pretending to be Cain Marko, but discovered the real Cain Marko hiding under the staircase. Xavier attempted to restore Cain's self- respect. The false Juggernaut happened upon them, but, upon this duplicate making contact with the true Cain Marko, Marko had his Juggernaut power returned to him and vanquished the entity controlling his mind. The Juggernaut started to feel his powers mysteriously increasing, and felt an irresistible urge to go somewhere. He easily shrugged off an attack by Thor, but Thor persisted with the struggle. Observing this elsewhere, Loki enquired of the Flame of Truth about the Juggernaut. The flame recalled to Loki how Cyttorak empowered Marko, to which Loki responded that he had not heard the name of Cyttorak mentioned for quite some time. The Flame further informed Loki that not only did Cyttorak and his confederates have human followers, but that across the Earth humans had recently begun to receive psychic calls drawing them to artifacts of these entities to become Exemplars. Two of these exemplars, Bedlam and Conquest, arrived to aid the Juggernaut in his battle against Thor. They teleported the Juggernaut away. An Exemplar machine under the Daily Bugle was noted and destroyed by Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor and the astral form of Professor Xavier. The Exemplars moved to the North Pole to construct a new device. The entities behind the Wager of the Octessence decided to implement the creation of the seven other Exemplars, and the Juggernaut once again was caught in Cyttorak‚Äôs machinations, as Cyttorak tormented him in his mind. At the North Pole, Thor, Iron Man, Spider-Man and Xavier were trapped. Xavier telepathically helped Marko resist. Marko decided, of his own free will, to oppose the Octessence scheme. He subdued Bedlam and damaged the engine. The heroes were freed and assisted Marko in battling the others. Marko ultimately destroyed the engine and the Exemplars were ejected to the far corners of the earth. As vengeance for opposing his will, Cyttorak caused the Juggernaut's powers to slowly fade. =Third Avatar= Hongdo Park Cyttorak granted the power and form of the Juggernaut to an unnamed youth, whom Cain knew. This child had attracted the attention of the X-Men by torturing animals. This new Juggernaut attacked Cain while he and the She-Hulk were enjoying the afterglow of sexual intercourse. Marko, who had only half of his original power fought with his brains instead of his brawn. Recognizing the kid, Cain thought of the Juggernaut persona as \\"an angry kid in a muscle suit\\". In the \\"She-Hulk\\" series, it is shown that a piece of one of his gems was used to create a new creature from Man-Elephant calling itself Behemoth where he had an elephant-like appearance. =Fourth Avatar= Piotr Rasputin In the Fear Itself storyline, Cain Marko becomes Kuurth: Breaker of Stone (one of the Heralds of a long-dormant god of fear known as the Serpent) upon lifting one of the hammers that fell towards the Raft. Colossus makes a bargain with Cyttorak to gain the power to stand against Kuurth. Colossus becomes the new avatar of the Juggernaut and is able to push Marko back until he is summoned by the Serpent. =Fifth and Sixth Avatar= Living Monolith and Cain Marko When the Gem of Cyttorak returned, Cain was one of the people to hear its call. Deciding to destroy the gem, he took various weapons and contracted Vanisher to transport him to the Thailand temple where the gem of Cyttorak rested. They arrived just as the X-Men and various others fought for the gem.Amazing X-Men Vol 2 #16 As Vanisher teleported away, Cain battled the various mercenaries there and surprised Man- Killer with his remaining strength, knocking her out of the temple. Nightcrawler tried to thank him, but he knocked him and Marvel Girl away and took Iceman's head in his hands, demanding that he admitted that they killed his brother. Iceman manage to free himself, but Cain took Rachel and Nightcrawler until Northstar admitted that Cyclops killed Xavier in cold blood. They were interrupted when Rockslide, having defeated the demon guarding the temple crashed through the door wall, giving Cain the opportunity to go for the gem. He was stopped by Colossus, who also wanted to destroy the gem. Thinking the other wanted the power, both battled until the Living Monolith claimed the power of the Juggernaut.Amazing X-Men Vol 2 #17 As Abdol showed off his newfound powers, Marko stayed with the X-Men while they tried to figure out how to defeat the new Juggernaut. Eventually Colossus came up with an idea: while the X-Men dealt with Abdol, he would offer Cyttorak a deal. In return for Cyttorak granting all of his powers to him, Colossus would then kill him. The deal was accepted, but Cyttorak made an alteration to the bargain: instead, he passed his powers on to Cain Marko, making him once again the Juggernaut.Amazing X-Men Vol 2 #18 Powers and abilities Cyttorak exists as a deity with enormous magical power. He has provided indestructible bands (the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak) to Doctor Strange to use as a shield or to restrain enemies, and provided power to the titanic Juggernaut through an enchanted ruby. The ruby has withstood being thrown into orbit by the Juggernaut, as well as re-entry when it was bumped out of orbit by Nova. Stevie, a spoiled little boy from the Midwest, managed to use the Cyttorak Ruby to spectacular effects unimagined by Cain Marko, starting with using it to blast Marko. He used the ruby with his computer to monitor far away events, as well as using the ruby to relay a message to the East Coast using a non- operational computer on the West Coast. Furthermore, he could alter mirrors so that the original Human Torch's flame was reflected and enhanced back against him. Stevie could animate inanimate objects, which could also turn intangible. These objects included wax statues, some which resembled monsters, others that resembled Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Cable, and more, although the copies had reduced abilities compared to the originals, and tended to move slowly. Cyttorak has also demonstrated the ability to create life when he created an entire race of elves out of magical energy simply so he could have somebody to worship and adore him.Dr. Strange (vol.3) #44 Other people who have gained powers from Cyttorak include the Skrull Jazinda, the former Man-Elephant turned Behemoth, and a magician who works for S.H.I.E.L.D. who claims he worships the god.

The respective campuses are located approximately apart. It is known as the Third Saturday in October because the game was traditionally played on it prior to the 1992 football season, when the Southeastern Conference (SEC) split into its Eastern and Western divisions. From 1995 to 2015, it was only scheduled for that date six times, though it was scheduled for that date in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Alabama leads the series 57‚Äì37-8. Series history The first game was played in 1901 in Birmingham, a 6‚Äì6 tie. From 1902 to 1913, Alabama dominated the series, only losing once, and never allowing a touchdown by the Volunteers. 100px Beginning in 1928, the rivalry was scheduled on its \\"traditional\\" date. Robert Neyland, Tennessee's coach and namesake of the present Tennessee stadium, began challenging Alabama for their perennial spot on top of the conference standings. It was officially given the name Third Saturday in October in 1939. Both Robert Neyland and Bear Bryant made the rivalry heated during their tenure at Tennessee and Alabama. 100px The Alabama‚ÄìTennessee game has been played in three locations: Birmingham, Alabama, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In the first four (1901‚Äì1908) meetings, the game was held in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1909, the home and home series began, though most of Alabama's home game against Tennessee were played in Birmingham. The teams did play in Tuscaloosa a few times through 1930. The game was not played in Tuscaloosa after 1930 until 1999. Alabama leads the series in all three venues: for games contested in Birmingham, 21‚Äì14‚Äì6; in Knoxville, 26‚Äì20‚Äì1; and in Tuscaloosa, 10‚Äì4. Alabama won the last game, played on October 19, 2019, 35‚Äì13. Alabama and Tennessee both have 12 shutouts in the series. =Victory cigars= In the 1950s, Jim Goostree, the head athletic trainer for Alabama, began another tradition as he began handing out cigars following a victory over the Volunteers. Both teams continued the tradition for some time, though kept it secret due to NCAA rules concerning extra benefits and tobacco products. Alabama publicly restarted the tradition in 2005, though as a result, self-reported an NCAA violation. Every year since 2005, the winning team knowingly violates the NCAA rule and reports the violation in honor of tradition. = Streaks = The Alabama‚ÄìTennessee rivalry has been known for streaks. In the first major streak of the series, Bama won seven straight over the Vols from 1905 to 1913 (the two teams did not play in 1910 and 1911), outscoring the Vols 112‚Äì0 in the process. Alabama is currently experiencing the longest winning streak of the series, thirteen games, dating back to 2007. An eleven-game Alabama streak (1971-1981) was broken in 1982 when Johnny Majors led the Vols to an upset victory over Bear Bryant and the Tide. Alabama had a nine-game unbeaten streak from 1986 to 1994, including a tie in 1993 which was later forfeited due to NCAA sanctions. The streak was broken by Tennessee in 1995 when the Vols beat the Tide 41‚Äì14. Tennessee began their own seven game win streak that night, which was broken when Alabama defeated the Vols 34‚Äì14 in 2002. To-date, Tennessee is the only team to own seven consecutive victories over the Tide.  Game results  Rankings are from the AP Poll  Notable games  1901: 1901 was the first meeting between the two teams. It ended early in a 6‚Äì6 tie, when fans rushed onto the field after a controversial offside call and the umpires were unable to clear out the crowd in the second half. In the game, J. L. Broug scored for Tennessee and A. W. Stewart scored for Alabama. 1909 Tennessee fans chased referee R. T. Elgin away from the stadium.

At this time, the Alabama‚ÄìTennessee rivalry was officially designated as Third Saturday in October. 1950: Alabama had a 3‚Äì0 first quarter lead with his 20-yard field goal. Tennessee responded with a two-yard Andy Kozar touchdown run in the second quarter to give the Vols a 7‚Äì3 halftime lead. After a 43-yard Bobby Marlow touchdown run in the third gave Alabama a 9‚Äì7 lead, Kozar scored the game-winning touchdown on a fourth-and-one play, from the Alabama one-yard line, with less than one minute remaining in the game for a 14‚Äì9 Tennessee victory. 1964: In 1964, David Ray gave the Crimson Tide an early 3‚Äì0 lead after he connected on a 30-yard field goal in the first quarter. Alabama then extended their lead to 16‚Äì0 at halftime with a pair of second-quarter touchdowns. The first came on a one-yard Steve Sloan run and the second after Wayne Cook blocked a Tennessee punt that Gaylon McCollough returned 22-yards for a touchdown. The Volunteers cut the Tide's lead in half to 16‚Äì8 with a seven-yard Hal Wantland touchdown run and two-point conversion in the third quarter. A 23-yard Ray field goal in the fourth quarter provided for the final 19‚Äì8 Alabama victory. 1965: In a game that saw multiple turnovers result in failed touchdown opportunities, Alabama tied Tennessee 7‚Äì7 at Legion Field. After a scoreless first quarter, both teams scored their only touchdown in the second. Stan Mitchell scored first for the Vols on a one-yard run and Steve Sloan followed for Alabama with his one-yard run. The Crimson Tide had a chance to win the game in the final minute of the game. With only 0:36 remaining in the game, Alabama had possession at the Tennessee six-yard line. However, Alabama quarterback Ken Stabler thought the Tide gained a first down on the previous play and threw the ball out-of-bounds on a fourth down play and turned the ball over on downs back to the Vols. Tennessee then ran out the clock for the tie. 1966: A week following Alabama's win over Clemson, Alabama regained the No. 3 position in the AP Poll prior to the game against Tennessee. At a rain-soaked Neyland Stadium, Alabama overcame a 10‚Äì0 fourth quarter deficit and defeated the Vols 11‚Äì10 and preserved their perfect record. Tennessee scored all of their points in the first quarter. The first points came on a six-yard Dewey Warren touchdown pass to Austin Denney and next on a 40-yard Gary Wright field goal for a 10‚Äì0 lead. Still up by 10, the Crimson Tide made their comeback in the fourth quarter. Ken Stabler scored on a one-yard touchdown run and then successfully converted the two-point conversion on a short pass to Wayne Cook that made the score 10‚Äì8. With 3:23 left in the game, Steve Davis kicked the 17-yard, game-winning field goal that made the score 11‚Äì10. The Volunteers did manage to set up a 19-yard field goal attempt that went wide in the final 0:20 of the contest. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Tennessee to 23‚Äì19‚Äì7. 1967: In 1967, both Alabama and Tennessee were ranked in top ten. The game started with Walter Chadwick scored on a one-yard touchdown run for the Vols, Alabama responded with an eight-yard touchdown that tied the game 7‚Äì7 at the end of the first quarter. The score remained tied at the half after a scoreless second quarter. Tennessee then took a 17‚Äì7 lead in the third quarter on an 11-yard Chadwick touchdown pass to Ken DeLong and a 47-yard Karl Kremser field goal. Alabama responded with their final points early in the fourth quarter on a one-yard Ed Morgan touchdown run, but a pass was later intercepted by Albert Dorsey and returned 31-yards for a touchdown and a 24‚Äì13 Vols victory. The Tennessee win was also their first over the Crimson Tide since the 1960 season. 1968: In 1968, coach Bryant decide to go for the victory instead of a tie in the final minutes of the game, and after the failed two-point conversion the Volunteers held onto a 10‚Äì9 victory at Knoxville. Tennessee took an early 7‚Äì0 lead in the first quarter after Richmond Flowers scored on a one-yard touchdown run. Alabama responded later in the quarter with a 28-yard Mike Dean field goal that made the score 7‚Äì3. The score remained the same through the fourth quarter when Karl Kremser kicked what was then a SEC record 54-yard field goal that extended the Volunteers lead to 10‚Äì3. After the Tennessee field goal, the Crimson Tide had their most sustained drive of the game. The 80-yard drive culminated in a four-yard Donnie Sutton touchdown reception from Scott Hunter that made the score 10‚Äì9. However, instead of playing for the tie and kicking the extra point, coach Bryant elected to go for the win on a two-point conversion. On the attempt, Joe Kelley failed to complete the pass to Sutton and Tennessee won the game as a result 10‚Äì9. 1972: After a scoreless first quarter, the Crimson Tide took a 3‚Äì0 lead into halftime after Bill Davis connected on a 31-yard field goal in the second. Tennessee then took a 7‚Äì3 lead on a two-yard Condredge Holloway touchdown run in the third, and extended it to 10‚Äì3 with a 36-yard Ricky Townsend field goal in the fourth quarter. With 2:39 left in the game, Alabama took possession at the Vols 48-yard line, and three plays later Wilbur Jackson scored on a two-yard run. On the Tennessee possession that ensued, John Mitchell recovered a Holloway fumble at the Vols' 17-yard line. On the next play, Terry Davis gave Alabama a 17‚Äì10 lead with his touchdown run with just over one minute left in the game. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Tennessee to 25‚Äì23‚Äì7. 1982: Bear Bryant makes his final trip to Neyland Stadium. #2 Alabama's 11-game win streak over the Vols comes to an end 35-28 as UT coach Johnny Majors is carried to mid-field in celebration to shake Bryant's hand one last time. 1989: In 1989, both teams entered the game undefeated and ranked in the top ten. #10 Alabama defeated #6 Tennessee in an offensive shootout, 47‚Äì30. 1990: 2-3 Alabama traveled to Knoxville to face undefeated, #3 Tennessee. The score was tied at 6‚Äì6 with 1:35 remaining when UT kicker Greg Harris' 50 yard field goal attempt was blocked by Alabama's Stacy Harrison. The ball bounced all the way to the Tennessee 37 yard line, setting up a field goal attempt for Alabama kicker Philip Doyle 3 plays later. Doyle converted the 48 yard attempt as time expired, giving Alabama a stunning 9‚Äì6 upset victory, considered by some the biggest upset in series history. 1993: 5‚Äì1, #10 Tennessee led #2, defending national champion Alabama at Legion Field 17‚Äì9 with 1:44 remaining. Alabama quarterback Jay Barker then led an 83-yard touchdown drive to close the gap to 17-15 before star wide receiver David Palmer ran in a two-point conversion to tie the game at 17 with only 21 seconds remaining. Tennessee elected to run out the clock, preserving the 17‚Äì17 tie - the last tie in Alabama football history - and ending Alabama's 28 game winning streak. Alabama later had to forfeit this game and it is officially considered a Tennessee Win. 1998: The Vols continue their unexpected and undefeated march to Tempe and the national championship by defeating Alabama 35‚Äì18 in Knoxville. Tennessee extend their streak to four in the row against Alabama. 2002: #19 Alabama, banned from postseason play due to NCAA probation, defeated #16 Tennessee 34‚Äì14 in Knoxville, ending Tennessee's seven-game winning streak - their longest streak in series history. 2003: #22 Tennessee, fighting to stay alive in the SEC East, traveled to Tuscaloosa to take on the unranked Crimson Tide. The two teams went to an unprecedented five overtime periods before Tennessee finally breaks the ice in the fifth overtime scoring a touchdown and the mandatory two-point conversion. Alabama would fail to answer the touchdown and Tennessee left Tuscaloosa victorious with a 51‚Äì43 win in the longest game in either team's history. 2005: Tennessee returned to Tuscaloosa ranked 17th after a disappointing 3‚Äì2 start following their preseason #2 ranking. Alabama came in ranked #5 and undefeated, their highest ranking entering the game since 1993. A defensive struggle ensued, with neither team able to find the endzone. With the score tied at 3-3, Tennessee appeared ready to score the game's first touchdown with 5:08 remaining. Running back Cory Anderson caught a swing pass and reached the two yard line before Alabama's Roman Harper knocked the ball loose and through the endzone for a touchback. Alabama quarterback Brodie Croyle then drove the Tide down into field goal range where Jamie Christensen kicked the game-winning field goal with 13 seconds left to give the Crimson Tide a 6‚Äì3 win and keep their undefeated season alive. 2009 Tennessee vs. Alabama 2009: Despite #1 Alabama entering the game as a 14-point favorite, the Crimson Tide struggled with the Volunteers, holding only a slim 12‚Äì3 lead late in the fourth quarter. With Alabama attempting to kill the clock, eventual Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram fumbled for the first time in 296 carries, giving Tennessee the ball in Alabama territory. Tennessee scored the first touchdown of the game eight plays later, making the score 12‚Äì10. Tennessee then recovered an onside kick at their own 41 yard line, needing only a field goal to pull off the upset. After reaching the Alabama 28 yard line, Tennessee attempted a would-be game-winning field goal of 43 yards. Alabama's standout defensive lineman, Terrence Cody, blocked the low line-drive kick, his second blocked field goal of the quarter, preserving the 12-10 Alabama victory en route to an eventual National Championship. 2015: Tennessee came to Tuscaloosa immediately after a big win against rival Georgia and hoped to get another upset, while Alabama was focused on keeping its College Football Playoff hopes alive. At half time, the game was tied 7‚Äì7. Alabama kicked two field goals in the second half, giving them a 13‚Äì7 lead in the 4th quarter. With 5:49 left on the clock, Tennessee running back Jalen Hurd scored a touchdown to give the Vols a late 14‚Äì13 lead. Alabama responded with a lengthy drive capped off by a 14-yard touchdown run by eventual Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry. Alabama attempted a two-point conversion to stretch the lead to a touchdown, but failed, leaving the score at 19‚Äì14. On the ensuing drive, Tennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs was sacked by linebacker Ryan Anderson, leading to a fumble recovered by Alabama. The Crimson Tide then killed the clock, preserving a narrow 19‚Äì14 victory and extending their winning streak in the series to 9 games. Alabama would eventually win the College Football Playoff national championship that season. Rivalry Ties Both football programs share very notable people. Bill Battle, Alabama's Athletic director from 2013‚Äì17, was the head coach of Tennessee from 1970‚Äì76 and played on the Crimson Tide's 1961 national championship squad.

Groundbreaking for the Civic Center Administration Building took place in 1960, after Wright's death and under the watch of Wright's prot√©g√©, Aaron Green; it was completed in 1962. The Hall of Justice was begun in 1966 and completed in 1969. Veterans Memorial Auditorium opened in 1971, and the Exhibit Hall opened in 1976. Located away from the former county seat in downtown San Rafael, the expansive complex stretches across two valleys just east of US 101. Its pink stucco walls, blue roof and scalloped balconies are distinctive. The smaller wing is the county administration building and the larger the Hall of Justice, joined by a round structure on a small hill that houses a county library. A battle between factions of the Marin County Board of Supervisors played out through the selection of the site and the architect, the financing of the project, and its eventual completion. The Marin County Civic Center is a state and National Historic Landmark. The nearby fairgrounds host the Marin Sonoma Concours d‚ÄôElegance each spring; they host the Marin County Fair each July. Architecture The selection of Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957 to design the Civic Center was controversial. The Civic Center project was Wright's largest public project, and encompassed an entire campus of civic structures. The post office was the only federal government project of Wright's career. Wright's design borrowed ideas and forms from Wright's Broadacre City concept, first published in 1932. =Main building= anodized metal (1963). The principal structure consists of a four-story, long Administration Building and a three- story, long Hall of Justice at a lower elevation, joined at a 120-degree angle with an diameter rotunda. The Hall of Justice spans a small valley, arching twice over an access road and a parking area, while the Administration Building spans a smaller ravine. Both structures are entered through archways on their lower levels. The long principal facades are marked by shallow non- structural arches of decreasing span with each story. The arches, which are framed in metal with a stucco appliqu√©, overlap slightly at the lower level. On the intermediate level, they appear to stand on short slender gold-anodized columns, and on the top level, they become round openings with gold railings directly under the deep roof overhang. The railings themselves have a circular pattern. The bright blue roof is itself patterned with arched cut-outs and raised circular patterns The building wings are arranged as a barrel vault shape on either side of the central galley, asymmetrically disposed. Interior guardrails at the atrium are solid stucco with no metal elements. Entrances are controlled by vertical grills of gold-anodized metal with rounded tops and bottoms, rather than doors. The eaves are embellished with an arched fascia with small gold balls inset in each arch, a pattern repeated in the atria. Interior of Marin County Civic Center (2008). The rotunda on the central hill houses the county library and a central cafeteria. Its gold spire was meant to house a radio transmitter, as well as the boiler plant's chimney. The interiors are arranged around open atria or \\"malls\\" as Wright called them, which allow natural light into the space. Originally open to the sky, the malls were later covered with skylights designed by William Wesley Peters. Interior spaces featured glass walls to allow light to penetrate from the exterior and the atrium, and to follow through on Wright's philosophy of maximum openness of government activities. Wright's concept envisioned a gold- colored roof, which proved to be impossible to obtain in a long-lasting material. After Wright's death, Olgivanna Wright chose a bright blue color that would weather well, gaining a softer color with age. The color choice, together with the pink stucco walls, was initially controversial, causing the building to become known as \\"Big Pink\\". The only large gold element is the spire at the rotunda.Green, p. 94 =Accessory buildings= The Post Office building is a one-story elliptical building near the entrance to the complex. Its facade repeats the arch motif, with circular embellishments on its canopy. The interior features an elliptical lobby. Veterans Memorial Auditorium (2007). The nearby Veterans' Memorial Auditorium was designed by the Taliesin Associated Architects and was completed in 1971 in a manner compatible with the main complex. The auditorium was designed for use by the county fair with a combination of flat-floor exhibition space and tiered seating spaces, using a compromise plan devised by Wesley Peters, George Izenour, and Aaron Green.Green, pp. 104-105 The main hall seats 1960 in an amphitheater arrangement. A separate Showcase Theater seats 300, and the exhibition hall can accommodate up to 2000 patrons. The original Hall of Justice design incorporated the Marin County Jail. As the jail outgrew its space a number of proposals were advanced for a new facility adjoining the Civic Center. A new, mostly underground jail was completed in 1994 in the hilltop immediately to the west of the Hall of Justice, designed by AECOM with 222 cells and 363 beds. The jail connects to the Hall of Justice by an underground link. The design concept was originally suggested by Aaron Green. The final design was reached after unsuitable underground and above-ground designs were rejected in the 1980s. Natural lighting of interior spaces is provided by skylit light wells over the common space of each of six pods. A Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit train station was constructed nearby which bears the same name. Politics Main Civic Center building, Hall of Justice on the left and the Administration Building on the right of the rotunda and spire The Marin Civic Center arose from a desire to consolidate county services at a single location, away from the center of San Rafael. The idea was combined with a proposed county fairground, and of the Scettrini ranch were purchased in 1956 for $551,416 along U.S. Highway 101 near Santa Venetia. The same year a selection committee was convened to select an architect, interviewing 26 firms, with a strong showing from Richard Neutra. Frank Lloyd Wright was not interviewed, and had indicated that he would not participate in a competitive selection. At the instigation of supervisor Vera Schultz, committee members and four county supervisors met Wright in June 1957 when he visited Berkeley to lecture at the University of California. Schultz was the most ardent backer of Frank Lloyd Wright as prospective civic center architect. If not for Schultz‚Äôs unwavering support and ironclad determination in the face of heated opposition, Wright‚Äôs version of the center would never have been built. Schultz had the support of three of the men on the board, but the fourth, William Fusselman, attempted to prevent Wright from getting the commission. On June 27 the Board of Supervisors voted 4-1, with Fusselman dissenting, to retain Wright. Wright arrived in San Rafael two days later. He was 90 years old. Fusselman, the holdout supervisor represented a conservative base that was opposed to the rapid pace of change in Marin County and to the proposed move from the center of San Rafael. Wright's fee of 10% of the construction cost drew criticism, as it was 2% higher than that proposed by other firms. Fusselman found a supporter in Wisconsin State Assemblyman Carroll Metzner, a virulent opponent of Wright in Wisconsin who appeared with Fusselman on local radio in Marin to denounce Wright's \\"socialist\\" design philosophy. Fusselman was also supported by the local chapter of the American Legion. At the board meeting that confirmed Wright's appointment Legionniare Bryson Reinhardt read into the record a denunciation of Wright as a supporter of Communism during World War II, prompting an angry response from Wright, who threatened to walk away from the project. The county clerk, a Fusselman ally who had helped to organize the Legionnaires' protest, lost Wright's contract. A carbon copy of the contract was signed by the president of the Board of Supervisors, and Wright stayed. Opponents demanded a referendum on the design, which was counteracted by an effective public relations campaign by supporters. Wright was directed to proceed with detailed design on April 28, 1958. In March 1959 Wright was appointed to design the post office. On April 9, 1959, Wright died, aged 91. Supervisor Fusselman attempted to obtain the plans as they were at Wright's death and to cut the fee by 2%. Both efforts were unsuccessful. Design of the first phase was complete in September 1959, directed by Wesley Peters and Aaron Green. The low bidder was Rothschild, Raffin and Weirick of San Francisco for $3,638,735 for the building and $596,470 for site development. Ground was broken on February 15, 1960 at a ceremony attended by Wright's widow, Olgivanna, Wright's son Lloyd Wright and grandson Eric Lloyd Wright, but not by Fusselman. The June 1960 election changed the makeup of the Marin County Board of Supervisors so that, in the following January, the new board voted to halt work on the project and possibly to convert it for use as a hospital, to replace a hospital that had been condemned. However, a poll by the Marin Independent Journal showing overwhelming support for the project pressured board members to change their minds. This, together with a negative report on conversion to hospital use by an independent architectural firm led to the lifting of the stop-work order, construction resumed a week later.Green, p. 75 The contractor sued for time and money lost during the stoppage. There was no further political opposition. The post office was the first building to be completed, and was dedicated on May 19, 1962. The Administration Building was dedicated on October 13, 1962, again without Fusselman. The Hall of Justice was financed by a special bond passed by referendum in 1965, which allocated $7.75 million to the $11.756 million cost of the new wing. Work by the contractor, Robert E. McKee of Dallas, Texas, was scheduled to be complete by October 1968. Strikes, bad weather, delivery problems for materials and design changes pushed the proposed completion to July 1969. The Hall of Justice was finally dedicated on December 13, 1969. Landmark designation Spire and cut-outs In recognition of its exceptional design the Marin County Civic Center main building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1991 and was designated a National Historic Landmark the same day. The designation came as a National Historic Landmark only thirty years after completion of the first phase, compared with the more usual 50-year term before a site is considered for NHL designation. It is also a California Historical Landmark, Number 999. It and other Wright buildings were considered for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but after a 2016 nomination to the World Heritage List was rejected by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, a revised 2018 proposal removed the Marin County Civic Center from the list. Attacks In August 1970 the Civic Center, which houses the Marin County Superior Court, was the scene of an attempted jailbreak led by Jonathan Jackson, the brother of Black Panther militant George Jackson, demanding the release of the so-called \\"Soledad Brothers\\". Jackson released several prisoners in the courtroom and the group took a number of hostages, including the presiding judge, Harold Haley. While they were attempting to escape, four people, including Judge Haley and Jonathan Jackson, were killed. The story, which featured dramatic photographs, was carried in newspapers nationally. Black Panther activist Angela Davis was eventually tied to the case, prompting her to go on the run before being caught and ultimately acquitted on charges of supplying firearms to Jonathan Jackson. Aaron Green designed a landscaped area near the Hall of Justice as a memorial to Judge Haley.Green, pp. 102-103 Later that same year, in October 1970, the WUO detonated a bomb at the Courthouse in retaliation. In popular culture The Marin County Civic Center was a filming location for director George Lucas's first feature-length film, THX 1138 (1971). That same year, on November 17, 1971, the science fiction author Philip K. Dick came to the police office, located in the building at the time, to report the theft of all his personal papers. Explosives were used to open his fire proof safe. According to biographer Joel Margot: \\"He was convinced it was the CIA. This troubling event starts a paranoia in Dick's mind, for nothing of value has been taken away [...]\\" Lucas would later use elements of the Civic Center design in the design of structures on Naboo in the Star Wars universe. The exterior and interior views of the buildings were featured in the seminal film Gattaca (1997). http://modernistarchitecture.blogspot.com/2016/07/a-visit-to- gattaca.html Although parts of Peter Frampton's live album Frampton Comes Alive! (1976) are said to have been recorded during his performance at the Marin County Civic Center on June 13, 1975., the album was actually recorded in the Summer and Fall of 1975, primarily at Winterland Auditorium in San Francisco and the Long Island Arena in Commack, New York, as well as a concert on the SUNY Plattsburgh campus in Plattsburgh, New York. The Grateful Dead recorded their album In the Dark (1987) in front of an empty house at the Marin Veterans Memorial Auditorium.In the Dark - at deaddisc.com. Retrieved on 2016-06-11 from http://www.deaddisc.com/disc/In_The_Dark.htm. Exterior views were pictured in the music video for the song \\"I Need a Doctor\\" by Dr. Dre from his album Detox.

Early life and Spanish service Giambelli was born at Mantua about the middle of the 16th century. Having had some experience as a military engineer in Italy, he went to Spain to offer his services to Philip II. However, his proposals were given a lukewarm reception, and as he could obtain no immediate employment from the king, he moved to Antwerp, where he soon gained considerable reputation for his knowledge in various departments of science. He is said to have married while living there.Motley, John Lothrop (1888), History of the United Netherlands, Harper & Brothers, New York (p. 189) The Siege of Antwerp An 18th century engraving, depicting the explosion of one of Giambelli's \\"hellburners\\" on the Duke of Parma's pontoon bridge at the Siege of Antwerp in 1585. Giambelli is said to have vowed to be revenged for his rebuff at the Spanish court; and when Antwerp was besieged by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma in 1584, he offered his services to Elizabeth I of England, who, having satisfied herself of his abilities, engaged him to advise in its defence. His plans for provisioning the town were rejected by the senate, but they agreed to a modification of his scheme for destroying the pontoon bridge which closed the entrance to the town from the side of the sea, by the conversion of two ships of 60 and 70 tons into \\"infernal machines\\" or \\"hellburners\\". Each ship had a masonry chamber built into the hold, filled with 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms) of gunpowder and heaped over with millstones, tombstones and scrap iron; stacks of timber and brushwood on the top deck were set alight to give the impression that it was an ordinary fire ship. The explosive charge was to be detonated by a clockwork mechanism activating a flintlock.Motley, pp. 191-192 One of these ships exploded against the bridge, and besides allegedly killing more than 1000 Spanish soldiers, effected a breach in the structure of more than 200 feet (61 Metres) in width. This might have led to the relief of the town by the waiting Dutch fleet, except for the hesitation of Vice-Admiral Jacob Jacobsen (or Jacobzoon).Motley, pp. 198-199 Service in England One of Giambelli's bastions at Carisbrook Castle, built between 1597 and 1600. After the surrender of Antwerp, Giambelli went to England, where he was employed by the Crown between 1585 and 1602, the last in a line of a number Italian engineers at the English court.Buisseret, David (1992), Monarchs, Ministers, and Maps: The Emergence of Cartography as a Tool of Government in Early Modern Europe, University of Chicago Press (p. 59) He was engaged during July and August 1588 in fortifying the Thames Estuary, which was considered the most likely site for the expected Spanish invasion. Works included the construction of earthen ramparts around the old blockhouses at Tilbury and Gravesend, and a boom defence across the river, consisting of a chain supported by 120 ships' masts; also a pontoon bridge was constructed to allow the English army to deploy on either shore. The boom broke at the first flood tide after its completion.Hutchinson, Robert (2013), The Spanish Armada, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, (pp. 60-61) The exact contribution of Giambelli to these works is unknown, because he is not mentioned in any of the reports made by the Earl of Leicester, the commander of the English army in Essex;Cruden, Robert Peirce (1843), The History of the Town of Gravesend, William Pickering, London (p, 237) however, his name is noted in the accounts, drawing a respectable fee of six shillings and eight pence (¬£0.33) per day.Cruden p. 271 When the Spanish Armada was attacked by fireships in the Calais roads, the panic which ensued was largely due to the conviction among the Spaniards that the fireships were \\"infernal machines\\" constructed by Giambelli; however they were unaware that he was fully occupied by the defensive works in the Thames and that a national shortage of gunpowder prevented its use in the English fireships.Hutchinson, p. 157 In 1591, Giambelli presented a plan to the Lord Burghley for a water system to cleanse the fetid ditches surrounding the City of London and another (perhaps a type of fire hydrant) which would allow fires in the City to be fought more effectively. Neither of these schemes seem to have been acted upon.Matthews, William (1835), Hydraulia, an Historical and Descriptive Account of the Water Works of London, Simkin, Marshall and Co, London (pp. 30-31) Starting in 1597, Giambelli constructed a trace Italienne fortification surrounding Carisbrook Castle on the Isle of Wight; the work was mostly completed by 1600, but remodelling of two of the castle's original towers was not completed until 1603. In 1602 at the request of the Privy Council, Giambelli surveyed the fort on Plymouth Hoe, which was sited on the location now occupied by the Royal Citadel, following complaints that the defences were inadequate. Giambelli made three reports on Plymouth. He suggested surrounding the town with a wall with nine ravelins.

Since 2012, it is part of the commune of K√§erjeng.  History  Bascharage with the other towns like Linger, Hautcharage and P√©tange were owned by the \\"Hoheit Kerschen\\". The first known reference to them was on April 4, 1281 for obtaining their freedom under the law of Beamont \\"Freiheitsbrief nach B√∂hmerrecht‚Äú. The freedom of Clemency probably happened in 1260. After the occupation of France (1794 ‚Äì 1815), the ‚ÄúHoheit Kerschen‚Äù changed in ‚Äúmunicipalit√© cantonale Bascharage‚Äù with the townships of Bascharage, Clemency, Mamer, Garnich and Dippach. This Township came out in 1799 as the ‚ÄúMairie de Bascharage‚Äù with the towns of Bascharage, Hautchaurage and Linger. Their first mayor was Pierre Clemont in 1800. The first mayor of Clemency was Pierre Decker (until 1830). Geologically, Bascharage does not belong to the Minette Region however they have a pretty tense relation with the iron industry. The Iron crisis in the 70s was responsible for the big loss of work for the citizens. Even so, the town has known a regularly evolution with the arrival of enterprises like General Motors or Luxguard. In Bascharage there is also the seat of the well known and probably biggest brewery of the country, Bofferding.  The old township Bascharage Until 2012, Bascharage was in a separate commune similarly named Bascharage. But on 1 January 2012, the Commune of Bascharage was merged with the Commune of Clemency with the combined township being named the Commune of K√§erjeng. The law creating K√§erjeng was passed on 24 May 2011. = Former commune = The former commune consisted of the villages: * Bascharage * Hautcharage * Linger  Amorial Bearings  The arms were conferred on the town by Grand Ducal decree of 21 July 1969.

Gemeng K√§erjeng (commune of K√§erjeng) Bascharage is now part of the commune of K√§erjeng (in Luxembourgish Gemeng K√§erjeng), one of the 106 communes in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and situated in the south-west of the country in the canton of Capellen. Before 2012, Bascharage was part of the similarly named Commune of Bacharage. But on 1 January 2012, the Commune of Bacharage was merged with Commune of the Commune of Clemency with the two former communes now forming the merged new commune of K√§erjeng. The law creating K√§erjeng as a commune was passed on 24 May 2011.  Economy  Bascharage is housing the national wide brewery blond beer which is known as Bofferding.

Location The parish has a population of about 1,000, being measured at 1,097 in the 2011 census. It is on the A607 road between Leicester and Melton Mowbray, and is just south of the River Wreake. Nearby places are East Goscote, Thrussington and Rotherby. In 2000, villagers got the approval of building a bypass for Rearsby, work started in August 2003 and by the following year the bypass was open allowing traffic to pass Rearsby without going through the village, the estimated cost of the bypass was ¬£5.9 million. It is a village with a strong community spirit which has been shown through a long-standing publishing of the Rearsby Scene (the local village newspaper). Rearsby Aerodrome Auster Autocrat built at Rearsby in 1946, modified to J/1N Alpha and parked in front of the Auster Aircraft factory in 1966 The County Flying Club moved to Rearsby in 1938 and created an aerodrome on land owned by Sir William Lindsay Everard. Rearsby airfield soon became the home of the Taylorcraft aircraft factory, which began light aircraft manufacture in 1939. The basic aircraft design was modified to become the British Army A.O.P. (Air Observation Post), the model being named the Auster. Following W.W.II, Taylorcraft Aeroplanes (England) Ltd changed its name to The Auster Aircraft Company Ltd. The aircraft was known as 'The All Steel Aeroplane\\". After initial success with the Autocrat and other models including the Aiglet and Autocar, post war civil aircraft sales slowed, particularly as there were many ex-military surplus aircraft available. In the early to mid-1960s Beagle Aircraft built the Beagle B.206 twin engined executive aircraft here. Post aircraft phase - Rearsby Automotive Limited Post-war, the company began using its manufacturing skills to supply the re-emerging UK motor industry. Auster Commercial, as this arm of the business was known, changed its name to Rearsby Automotive Ltd in 1966. Auster was now part of Pressed Steel Company which in turn was a division of the British Motor Corporation. In 1968, Auster Aircraft/Rearsby Automotive became part of British Leyland. Aircraft manufacture ceased in 1969. Rearsby Automotive expanded its sales quickly in order to occupy the whole site, before British Leyland sold off the former aircraft factory and airfield. The automotive business, under the name, Rearsby Components, won business with Ford, Chrysler UK and G.M., British Leyland's competitors. The business became highly profitable. Meanwhile, its parent company went from strife and crisis to crisis throughout the 1970s. In 1981, British Leyland, as part of its consolidation process, announced to the Rearsby management, the plant was to close. The management team, led by Ivor Vaughan, believed in the future of the business and organised/created the first British Leyland management buy-out (MBO) in 1982, indeed one of the very early UK MBOs. Rearsby Automotive Ltd was resurrected. The business continued to expand winning business with Nissan, Honda, Toyota and VW, designing and developing all the products it supplied for its customer vehicles. This included supplying components in high volume to vehicle plants in Japan. The company also adopted lean manufacturing philosophies. Sales had grown to ¬£29m in 1996. The original MBO team sold the business in 1996 to Adwest group but the business failed in 2003. The site, now Rearsby Business Park, is still owned by the original MBO team. Following the failure of Adwest to nurture and grow the business and the closure in 2003, the MBO team spent over ¬£2m renovating and improving the buildings and site with the principal aim of re-establishing employment back to Gaddesby Lane. As of 2017, some 200 are employed on site.

It has been in continuous publication since 1885 and is based in London. It is particularly notable for its classified advertisements for domestic service and child care; it also has extensive listings of holiday properties. History and profile The magazine was founded by Thomas Gibson Bowles (1842-1922), the maternal grandfather of the aristocratic and controversial Mitford sisters. Bowles also founded the English magazine Vanity Fair. Bowles gave the Mitford girls' father (David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale) his first job: general manager of the magazine. Early contributors included Nancy Mitford and Lewis Carroll, who compiled a puzzle for the title. In November 2008, Bowles' great grandson, Ben Budworth, took the reins as publisher on behalf of the family and set about modernising its style. As part of this process, Budworth appointed Rachel Johnson as the magazine's ninth editor in September 2009 she took over from Arline Usden who became an editor at large.

Sai Kung is the central hub of nearby surrounding villages, and hence the name may also refer to the areas in its immediate surroundings. Name Sai Kung Town or just Sai Kung, was established as a market town for the surrounding villages as , around 100 years ago. Nowadays, in the legal documents, the town is more often referred as . Despite in modern transliteration, usually means city, but in Classical Chinese, and both means market. The word was also used by the colonial British government to transliterate the word Town, such as Tai Po Town. The town is named after Sai Kung (). Which the name was appeared in the Western publications dated back to the early 1900s, but only stated as \\"the village of Sai Kung\\". Sai Kung also probably first appeared on the map of the Xin'an County, made by Simeone Volonteri in 1866. The origins of the name Sai Kung is unknown. Moreover, there are criticisms on the accuracy of Volonteri's map in general, or for specific place name such as Green Hill, which historically known as Tuen Mun Hill. History According to Professor , there was no market where modern day Sai Kung District is today that were recorded in the Qing dynasty's Xin'an Xianzhi (), or in Kangxi edition (1688) nor in Jiaqing edition (1819). Instead, he stated that due to inaccessibility of land based transport, Leung Shuen Wan was probably developed into a moorage inlet in the 18th century. Shops were open on the Leung Shuen Wan Island (known in English as the High Island, and not inside the modern boundary of Sai Kung Town), as well as a Tin Hau Temple, for the boat people that lives on their boats. Objects in the Temple dated back to year 1741 of the western calendar. He also stated, market(s) for Sai Kung Peninsula was founded before the signing of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory in 1898, which ceded many places along with the whole Peninsula to the Hong Kong colony as the New Territories and New Kowloon. In the early 1900s, the Sai Kung market had expanded into 50 shops, plus 4 boat building sheds. At the same time, a smaller market of 18 shops was existed in Hang Hau. (Hang Hau became part of the built-up area of Tseung Kwan O New Town, and not part of Sai Kung Town) There were no proper education centres in Sai Kung Peninsula at that time, as traditional study halls were located inside their own villages. However, the Catholic Church of Hong Kong had established a primary school at the end of the 19th century, which taught western curriculum in the market town. The colonial British government also established a police station and a dispensary near the market town. During the World War I, ships were required to be inspected by the Royal Navy when entering or leaving the Victoria Harbour. The Port Shelter and the Sai Kung market town were located outside the harbour, thus benefited from the policy to become a place for resupply. A temple inside the Sai Kung market town, also became the local civic centre that settle disputes. The shop owners, which were not from the surrounding villages, even represented Sai Kung in Heung Yee Kuk in the 1920s. Heung Yee Kuk represented the interests of the rural villages of the New Territories and recognized by the colonial government as a consulting institution. However, in the 1930s, the local merchants formed their own chamber of commence and gradually took over the political influence on the market town. Nowadays however, the seat for the Sai Kung Central constituency is elected by the local residents of the town through universal suffrage. The rural villages surrounding the town, still elect representatives to Heung Yee Kuk, however. According to another author, the Sai Kung market town received the economic expansion in the 1950s. At the time, the world was enforcing an embargo policy to the newly established the People's Republic of China, which the market town became a place for smuggling goods to the Republic. Sai Kung town underwent significant expansion during the 1970s when the High Island Reservoir and associated water schemes required some villagers and fishermen to be rehoused in Sai Kung. This provided a core of government-funded new development, both housing and commercial, in the town centre. This was followed by the Tui Min Hoi (literally 'over the harbour') development under the government's market town programme. Before the relocation of the airport of Hong Kong from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok, the town was a popular residential area for airport staff from all over the world. The town is next to Sai Kung Hoi, which was a fishing harbour. The harbour is now a typhoon shelter, where motorized junks used in the local tourist trade are moored. They are boats that can be hired for fishing and swimming trips. Boundaries The statutory boundary of the town was regulated by urban zoning plan Sai Kung Town Outline Zoning Plan (OZP), which was prepared in the 2000s, and approved circa 2006. However, in election, the town is served by the constituency Sai Kung Central, which roughly cover the same area as the OZP. The statutory boundaries of the town are Hiram's Highway, Po Tung Road and Tai Mong Tsai Road in the north and west. In the south the town is bordered to the conservation area Tsiu Hang Special Area, as well as Pak Sha Wan Peninsula. In the east the coastline served as the boundary.

Biography Glinka was born at Sutoki, Dukhovshchinsky Uyezd, Smolensk Governorate in 1786, and was specially educated for the army. In 1803 he obtained a commission as an officer, and two years later took part in the Austrian campaign. His tastes for literary pursuits, however, soon induced him to leave the service, whereupon he withdrew to his estates in the government of Smolensk, and subsequently devoted most of his time to study or travelling about Russia. Upon the Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, he re-entered the Russian army, and remained in active service until the end of the campaign in 1814. Upon the elevation of Count Miloradovich to the military governorship of St. Petersburg, Glinka was appointed colonel under his command. After the Decembrist Revolt Glinka was suspected of revolutionary tendencies. He was banished to Petrozavodsk, but he nevertheless retained his honorary post of president of the Society of the Friends of Russian Literature, and was after a time allowed to return to St. Petersburg. Soon afterwards he retired completely from public life and died on his estates at the age of 93. Works Glinka's martial songs have special reference to the Russian military campaigns of his time. He is also known as the author of the descriptive poem Karelia (1830), and of a metrical paraphrase of the book of Job, which was praised by D.S. Mirsky as the finest religious poetry in the language. His fame as a military author is chiefly due to his Pisma Russkago Ofitsera (\\"Letters of a Russian Officer\\") (8 vols., 1815‚Äì1816). His most infamous work which remains exceedingly rare was his contribution of an allegory to the first Swedish translation of John William Polidori‚Äôs Vampyre (Vampyren) credited to Lord Byron. (Published by Jakob Simelius of Helsinki in 1824) which was marks the first ever appearance of the vampire story in Nordic literature.

History One of the earliest mentions of this place is in the Domesday book where named Segrave, it is listed amongst the lands in the wapentake of Goscote given to Henry de Ferrers by King William I. The land consisted of work for one plough and four acres of meadow. By the twelfth century, Seagrave was owned by the de Segrave family, who built a fortified manor house in the parish.Seagrave Parish Council, Seagrave and its Background. Uploaded 28 January 2015. Their familial coat of arms was later adopted by the village. In March 1234 Richard Siward, at the head of a company of outlaws, ravaged Stephen de Segrave's native place, evidently Seagrave, burnt his fine houses, oxen, and stores of grain, and carried off many valuable horses and rich spoil. Later the same band ravaged Alconbury, and burnt his buildings there. In 1346 population growth led to the division of the wapentake; for judicial matters Seagrave was in the hundred of East Goscote. The effects of Parliamentary enclosure on social and economic aspects of England and its people can be understood by examining the results of the Seagrave enclosure act of 1760, which effectively converted copyhold tenure in the open fields to freehold tenure. The village attempts to preserve its better buildings through repurposing. The Primitive Methodist chapel was converted into a house which still has the original nameplate, with ‚ÄòPrimitive‚Äô spelled in an obsolete form as ‚ÄòPrimative‚Äô.

The One Per Desk was built by International Computers Limited (ICL) and launched in the UK in 1984. It was the result of a collaborative project between ICL, Sinclair Research and British Telecom begun in 1981, originally intended to incorporate Sinclair's flat-screen CRT technology. Rebadged versions of the OPD were sold in the United Kingdom as the Merlin Tonto and in Australia as the Telecom Australia Computerphone.  Hardware  From the QL, the OPD borrowed the 68008 CPU, ZX8301/8302 ULAs, 128 KB of RAM and dual Microdrives (re-engineered by ICL for greater reliability) but not the 8049 Intelligent Peripheral Controller. Unique to the OPD was a \\"telephony module\\" incorporating an Intel 8051 microcontroller (which also controlled the keyboard), two PSTN lines and a V.21/V.23 modem, plus a built-in telephone handset and a TI TMS5220 speech synthesiser (for automatic answering of incoming calls). The OPD was supplied with either a 9-inch monochrome (white) monitor or a 14-inch colour monitor. Both monitors also housed the power supply for the OPD itself. Later, 3.5\\" floppy disk drives were also available from third-party vendors. ICL were the preferred supplier for UK local government, and OPDs found their way onto desks of council officers. Due to the cost, they tended to be issued only to the most senior, who were often elderly, had no interest in computers, and had secretaries to handle their administrative work, so many devices were simply used as telephones.  Software  The system firmware (BFS or \\"Basic Functional Software\\") was unrelated to the QL's Qdos operating system, although a subset of SuperBASIC was provided on Microdrive cartridge. The BFS provided application-switching, voice/data call management, call answering, phone number directories, viewdata terminal emulation and a simple calculator. The Psion applications suite bundled with the QL was also ported to the OPD as Xchange and was available as an optional ROM pack. Other optional application software available on ROM included various terminal emulators such as Satellite Computing's ICL7561 emulator, plus their Action Diary and Presentation Software, address book, and inter-OPD communications utilities. An ICL supplied application was used to synchronise a national bingo game across hundreds of bingo halls in the UK. The integral V.23 dialup modem was used to provide remote communications to the central server. Several UK ICL Mainframe (Series 39) customers, in Local Government and Ministry of Defence sectors, used statistics applications on OPD systems to view graphical representations of mainframe reports. Once again, the integral V.23 modem was used to download from the mainframe.  Merlin Tonto  British Telecom Business Systems sold the OPD as the Merlin M1800 Tonto. BT intended the Tonto to be a centralised desktop information system able to access online services, mainframes and other similar systems through the BT telephone network. The Tonto retailed at ¬£1,500 at launch. OPD peripherals and software ROM cartridges were also badged under the Merlin brand. BT withdrew support for the Tonto in February 1993. The name Tonto was derived from \\"The Outstanding New Telecoms Opportunity\\"  MegaOPD  An enhanced version of the OPD was produced in small numbers for the United States market. This had a 68008FN CPU, 256 KB of RAM as standard, an RS-232 port and enhanced firmware. The telephone answering function had a female voice, with a slight New Jersey accent.

For years, the enormous grand ballroom within, with its 30-foot (9.1 m) ceilings and extensive gold leaf decor, was a fixture of the social scene in Yonkers, playing host to all manner of meetings, parties and theatrical productions including speeches by Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt (resulting in its being named \\"The Roosevelt Ballroom\\" by Encore Caterers.

By the 1980s, most of the building had been converted to low-rent apartments, while parts of it were left entirely unoccupied. In the 1990s, the building benefited from a renewed interest in local development, and was heavily renovated and restored. The grand \\"Roosevelt\\" ballroom once again found its place as a focal point of local culture. The building was restored and renamed the Philipsburgh Performing Arts Center (PPAC, pronounced \\"P-pack\\" locally) in 2001.

Aside from the eastern Pacific Ocean, it is found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide. This rarely encountered shark swims close to the bottom of the seafloor, typically at depths of , though it may enter much shallower water. The bramble shark has a stout body with two small dorsal fins positioned far back and no anal fin. It can be readily identified by the large, thorn-like dermal denticles scattered over its body, some of which may be fused together. It is purplish brown or black in color and grows up to long. The diet of the bramble shark includes smaller sharks, bony fishes, and crabs, which this slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15‚Äì52 pups. Harmless to humans, it is an occasional bycatch of commercial and recreational fishers, and may be used for fishmeal and liver oil. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. However, its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of overfishing. Taxonomy The original description of the bramble shark was authored by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclop√©dique et m√©thodique des trois regnes de la nature. He named it Squalus brucus, from the Greek brux or bruchios meaning \\"from the depths of the sea\\". The type specimen has since been lost. In 1816, Henri de Blainville created the genus Echinorhinus for this species. Until the 1960s, specimens of the prickly shark (E. cookei) caught in the Pacific Ocean were misidentified as bramble sharks. Other common names for this species are spinous shark and spiny shark. Description The bramble shark has a \\"thick\\", cylindrical body and a somewhat flattened head. The snout is blunt and shorter than the width of the mouth, with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin. The eyes lack nictitating membranes; the tiny spiracles are located well behind them. The wide, curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners. There are 20‚Äì26 upper and 22‚Äì26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is knife-like, with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest. The pectoral fins are short and angular, while the pelvic fins are long and relatively large. The dorsal fins are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the pelvic fin origins. There is no anal fin. The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the caudal fin origins. The asymmetrical caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin. The skin is covered by a layer of foul-smelling mucus several millimeters thick. The dermal denticles are scattered irregularly over the body and vary greatly in size, measuring up to across. Each denticle is thorn-like in shape, with ridges radiating out from the central point over the base. As many as ten denticles may be fused together to form multi-pointed plates. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth is densely covered by small denticles in sharks under long; these denticles become larger and sparser in larger sharks. This species is brown to black above, with a metallic purplish hue, and paler below; some individuals have red or black blotches. There is a report of one specimen that had a greenish glow when freshly caught. The bramble shark may reach in length. The maximum weight on record is for a long female. Distribution and habitat Records of the bramble shark are fairly rare and originate from widely scattered locations in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, save for the eastern Pacific Ocean. Most have come from the eastern Atlantic and western Indian Oceans, where its range extends from the North Sea and the British Isles to southern Mozambique, including the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Atlantic, this species is represented by a handful of specimens from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tobago, Brazil, and Argentina. In the Indo-Pacific, it is known from Oman, India, southern Japan, southern Australia, New Zealand, and possibly Kiribati. Found close to the sea floor, the bramble shark most commonly inhabits continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of . However, it has been reported from as shallow as , in areas with upwellings of cold water, and from as deep as . At least in European waters, this species may migrate into shallower depths of during the summer. Biology and ecology The spiny dogfish (pictured) is a known prey item of the bramble shark. Bramble shark embryo with external yolk sac. Sluggish in nature, the bramble shark feeds on smaller sharks (including the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias), bony fishes (including ling, catfishes, and lizardfishes), and crabs. The large size of its pharynx, relative to its mouth, suggests that it may capture prey by suction. This species is aplacental viviparous; females have two functional ovaries and two uteruses. Recorded litter sizes have ranged from 15 to 52, and newly born pups have been estimated to measure long. The dermal denticles in near-term embryos are underdeveloped, appearing as minute spines located within open pits in the skin. The size at sexual maturity is uncertain; the smallest known mature males and females are and long respectively. Human interactions The bramble shark is not known to pose a danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries in bottom trawls and on fishing line, as well as by sport anglers. In the eastern Atlantic, this species is processed into fishmeal but has little commercial significance. Its liver oil is highly valued in South Africa as medicine, whereas in India the oil is considered poor and is used to coat canoes to discourage woodboring beetles. Historical accounts suggest that bramble shark numbers in the northeastern Atlantic have fallen markedly since the 18th and 19th centuries, such as that it is now extremely rare off northern Europe and in the Mediterranean. This decline has been attributed to fishing pressure, to which this species may be highly vulnerable as large, deep-sea sharks generally have slow growth rates and long lifespans. Regarding the species as a whole, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lacks sufficient data for an assessment beyond Data Deficient. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the bramble shark as \\"At Risk ‚Äì Naturally Uncommon\\" with the qualifiers \\"Data Poor\\" and \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

He died at age 24 from tuberculosis, before either career could seriously get under way. Michiz≈ç struggled to find a way for an urban poet to root himself in traditional customs and still be \\"modern.\\" Though a citizen of Tokyo, Michiz≈ç would rarely mention modern urban scenes in his work. Aside from several references to cars, Michiz≈ç chose to describe a vegetable, not a mineral realm. He described trains as vehicles of escape, rescuing him from being cooped up in his architectural office. The natural landscapes of the Shinano Highlands provided an endless parade of conventional imagery that Michiz≈ç would use in his work; such as birds, clouds, flowers, grasses, mountains, skies, trees, and wind. A sizable part of his poetry used poetic impulse, often causing his work to be labelled as \\"sentimental\\". He wrote openly about his feelings and expressed what was in his heart, allowing his verse to be both uncontaminated and genuine. His Dharma name was Onky≈çin Shiund≈ç Norikiyo Shinshi (Ê∏©ÊÅ≠Èô¢Á¥´Èõ≤ÈÅìÁØÑÊ∏Ö‰ø°Â£´). Education & development Michiz≈ç as early on as preschool took an interest drawing, and teachers began to regard him as a child prodigy. In 1927, Michiz≈ç entered Morioka Third High School where he joined the Painting Club, which taught him the use of pastel crayons. He also joined the Magazine Club which instructed him in how to submit manuscripts for publication. By 1929 the Alumni Bulletin had printed 11 tanka and some of his drawings would win the silver medal in a student exhibition. Michiz≈ç tested out of the fifth year of high school and directly entered college choosing to study science; which required English. He joined the Literary Club and shifted from using tanka to free verse in his poetry. Michiz≈ç also began reading the German poet Rilke as well as French poets Val√©ry and Baudelaire. Michiz≈ç graduated from First College in 1934 and entered the Imperial University, a three-year course of study, as an architecture major. At the university, he won the annual prize for the best project or design by an architectural undergraduate three years in a row and was also asked by five different literary journals to submit works. Upon graduation, he was hired by Ishimoto Architects; however, he disliked his job where he felt cooped up and creatively hemmed in with no control over his conceptions. Tuberculosis By March 1938, Michiz≈ç began experiencing exhaustion and a sense of oppression. He also found himself sleeping more often and suffering from a low-grade fever. His doctor ordered rest, yet Michiz≈ç set off on a long trip to northern Honsh≈´ and Nagasaki. In December 1938 he arrived in Nagasaki exhausted, and admitted himself to a hospital where he began coughing up huge amounts of blood. He returned to Tokyo where doctors ordered continual rest; however, tuberculosis had already begun to affect other vital organs. He entered a Tokyo sanatorium. By March 29, 1939 his illness had completely taken over and he died.

There are 6 rows of saw-like teeth on its lower jaw and smaller teeth on its upper jaw. Skin color ranges from tan, through brown, to black. It has a light-colored lateral line down the sides and on the fins' edges, and darker colored spots on the sides. They also get stains/spots on their neural arches, and the number of stains increase as they get older.McFarlane, Gordon A. and King, Jacquelynne R. and Saunders, Mark W. (2002) Preliminary study on the use of neural arches in the age determination of bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus). Fishery Bulletin, 100(4), pp. 861-864. http://fishbull.noaa.gov/1004/17mcfarl.pdf Its pupils are black and its eye color is a fluorescent blue-green. The bluntnose sixgill shark can grow to , and possibly up to . Adult males generally average between , while adult females average between . The bluntnose sixgill shark resembles many of the fossil sharks from the Triassic period. A greater number of Hexanchus relatives occur in the fossil record than are alive today. They have one dorsal fin located near the caudal fin. The pectoral fins are broad, with rounded edges. The six gill slits give the shark its name. Most common sharks today only have five gill slits.

With a global distribution in tropical and temperate waters, the bluntnose sixgill shark is found in a latitudinal range between 65¬∞N and 48¬∞S in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans.Comfort, C.,M., Weng,K.,C. (2015). Vertical habitat and behaviour of the bluntnose sixgill shark in Hawaii. Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography, 115, 116-126. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2014.04.005. It has been seen off the coasts of North and South America from North Carolina to Argentina and Alaska to Chile. In the eastern Atlantic, it has been caught from Iceland to Namibia, in the Indo-Pacific it has been caught from Madagascar north to Japan and east to Hawaii and in the Mediterranean it has been caught in Greece and Malta. It typically swims near the ocean floor or in the water column over the continental shelf in poorly lit waters. It is usually found from the surface, inhabiting the outer continental shelf, but its depth range can extend from . Juveniles will swim near the shoreline in search of food, sometimes in water as shallow as , but adults typically stay at depths greater than . It can be seen near the ocean's surface only at night. An adult bluntnose sixgill shark was recently seen at a depth of 259 m (854.7 ft) in the Philippines. On December 2, 2017, the ROV camera of Paul Allen's research vessel RV Petrel captured video footage of the shark lurking around a World War II shipwreck in Ormoc Bay. This was the first time the species was photographed in Philippine waters. In 2018, a sixgill shark was filmed near the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, midway between Brazil and Africa, at a depth of around 400 feet. In 2019, the remains of a pregnant bluntnose sixgill shark were found on a Vancouver Island beach, north of Victoria, British Columbia. On 18 October 2019, a large bluntnose sixgill shark measuring over 3 meters and weighing 900 kg was found dead on the beach at Urkmez beach in Seferihisar, Izmir, Turkey. On 20 May 2020 bluntnose sixgill shark was found dead in the beach of Tabyalar, √áanakkale, Turkey Biology and ecology Although sluggish in nature, the bluntnose sixgill shark is capable of attaining high speeds for chasing and catching its prey using its powerful tail. Because of its broad range, it has a wide variety of prey, including fish, rays, chimaeras, squid, crabs, shrimps, seals, and other (smaller) sharks. The bluntnose sixgill shark is therefore classified as a generalist species, and is less likely to be affected by scarcity in any one of its food sources.https://rdcu.be/b1t3n Reproduction is ovoviviparous with embryos receiving nourishment from a yolk sac while remaining inside the mother. Litters are large and typically have 22-108 pups measuring at birth, and the largest recorded pup is . New pups are also born with a lighter belly color than adults. This form of cryptic coloration or camouflage is used to disguise the pup's appearance. A high mortality rate of the young pups is presumed, owing to the large litter size. The gestation period is unknown, but is probably more than two years, based on the gestation time of other hexanchiform sharks like the frilled sharks. Females reach sexual maturity at in length and 18‚Äì35 years in age, while males reach sexual maturity much earlier at in size and 11‚Äì14 years in age. Many biologists believe that the male bluntnose sixgill shark's teeth are specially adapted for courtship. The male nips at the female's gill slits using its longer-cusped teeth. This action is thought to entice the female into mating. Evidence of this hypothesis is that female bluntnose sixgill sharks show up with seasonal scars around their gill slits, which apparently is from breeding with males. Males and females are thought to meet seasonally between May and November. Human interaction The bluntnose sixgill shark is sold for its meat and oil. The bluntnose sixgill shark is listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because, despite its extensive range, its longevity and popularity as a sport fish makes it vulnerable to exploitation and unable to sustain targeted fishing for very long. Although population data is lacking in many areas for this species, certain regional populations have been classified as severely depleted. Although it is usually caught as bycatch, it is also caught for food and sport. In June 2018, the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the bluntnose sixgill shark as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifiers \\"Data Poor\\" and \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. Despite its massive size, this species is rather harmless to humans unless provoked.

History  The Museum was established in 1969 through the efforts of the Port Moody Historical Society (which became the Port Moody Heritage Society in 1979). First housed in a now-demolished building on Kyle Street behind Port Moody's former City Hall, the Port Moody Historical Society moved the collection to the city's second CPR train station in 1978. After the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) discontinued its passenger service on September 25, 1976, the Historical Society moved the station by truck from the foot of Queen Street to the cloverleaf beside Rocky Point Park. The Museum officially opened on July 1, 1983.  Operation  The operation of the museum is overseen by a volunteer board of directors. The museum is operated by a Executive Director, two Manager /Curators , and museum assistants.  Displays  The museum highlights the history of Port Moody from the aboriginal presence to the 1940s. As the CPR established the town, many of the displays (handcars, a boom car, a velocipede, the station itself) pertain to the railroad, leading many to mistake the museum for a purely rail museum. = Venosta railcar = In 1986, the Port Moody Station Museum acquired the Venosta, a first-class CPR sleeper car. The Venosta, now part of the display on the CPR, was constructed in 1921 as part of the CPR's effort to modernize their trains from a design by W. Winterrowd, the company's Chief Mechanical Engineer. In May 1942, the railcar's name changed from the Glen Otter to the Venosta. In November 1964, the CPR removed the Venosta from service and refurbished the railcar as Instructional Car No. 49, for usage in Calgary, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Red Deer and South Edmonton. Restoration of the railcar began in the fall of 1987, with volunteers from the Port Moody Heritage Society and the Westcoast Railway Association. = CPR railway garden = The Museum also features a recreation of a CPR railway garden based on 1910-1912 styles. The garden, established in 2000 by curator Jim Millar, contains many examples of heritage and heirloom vegetables and flowers. The Museum is a part of Canada's Seeds of Diversity. = Oral history project = Since 1975, the staff, volunteers and members of the Port Moody Station Museum have interviewed hundreds of Port Moody residents, former residents and people with a knowledge of the city. The project stalled for a number of years until 1999, when two museum staff members resurrected the project. The interviews were recorded initially on tape and converted in the summer of 2004 to compact disc; all new recordings are digital and preserved on compact disc. The collection is accessible only by CD, though museum volunteers are working to transcribe tapes. = Postcard barrel = In the summer of 2005, the Port Moody Station Museum established the world's third postcard barrel (after Floreana Island in the Gal√°pagos Islands and Crete in Greece). The concept is based on a tradition in the Gal√°pagos, in which British whalers set up a post office barrel in 1793 on Floreana Island for passing ships to leave their unstamped mail for hand- delivery by others on their voyage home. Using a dustbane barrel, the Museum's barrel is located in the former telegraph room of the train station and visitors can pick up postcards to hand-deliver or deposit their own, either by visiting the museum in person or by mailing them to the Port Moody Station Museum, where staff members stamp them with the official postcard barrel stamp and deposit it into the barrel.

Joseph Timothy O'Callahan (May 14, 1905 - March 18, 1964) was a Jesuit priest and, during World War II, a United States Navy chaplain. He was awarded the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during and after an attack on the aircraft carrier aboard which he was serving, . Early years and career O'Callahan was born on May 14, 1905, in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. He joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1922, shortly after graduating from Boston College High School. He began the 13 years of training required of a Jesuit at St. Andrew's College, Poughkeepsie, New York, where he received the Bachelor of Arts degree in 1925 and his Master of Arts degree in 1929, specializing in mathematics and physics in addition to religious philosophy. He was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood as a member of the Jesuit order in 1934. He was a Professor of Mathematics, Philosophy, and Physics at Boston College from 1927 to 1937. He then spent a year (1937‚Äì1938) as a Professor of Philosophy at Weston Jesuit School of Theology (Weston College). He served as the Director of the Mathematics Department at the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts from 1938-40. Among his students at Holy Cross was John V. Power, who would himself be awarded the Medal of Honor, although posthumously, during World War II. After the war, while O'Callahan was a patient at Saint Vincent Hospital, he was tended to by Power's sister, Patricia Power Rose, a nurse. Military service Appointed Lieutenant, J.G. in the Chaplain Corps of the U.S. Navy Reserve on August 7, 1940, Chaplain O'Callahan advanced progressively in rank and attained that of commander in July 1945. His first assignment at sea was on , participating in Operation Torch off North Africa in 1942 and Operation Leader off Norway in 1943. While in active service, O'Callahan reported aboard USS Franklin on March 2, 1945. 17 days later, the ship was severely damaged at dawn by two bombs from a lone Japanese aircraft. The hangar deck immediately became an inferno of exploding gas tanks and ammunition. Although wounded by one of the explosions after the attack, Chaplain O'Callahan moved about the exposed and slanting flight deck, administering the last rites to the dying, comforting the wounded, and leading officers and crewmen into the flames to carry hot bombs and shells to the edge of the deck for jettisoning. He personally recruited a damage control party and led it into one of the main ammunition magazines to wet it down and prevent its exploding. For this action he received the Navy Cross, which he publicly refused (the only man to do so in World War II). At the time, it was speculated that O'Callahan was offered the Navy Cross in lieu of the Medal of Honor since his heroic actions on USS Franklin highlighted perceived lapses in leadership by the ship's commanding officer, Captain Leslie E. Gehres, which reflected poorly on the Navy. President Harry Truman intervened after the resulting public outcry and the Medal of Honor was awarded to O'Callahan on January 23, 1946. He was the first Naval Chaplain so decorated. O'Callahan (right) with President Harry S. Truman (center) and other Medal of Honor recipients at their medal presentation ceremony in 1946. Later life O'Callahan returned to Holy Cross in the fall of 1948 as the head of the Mathematics Department. He died on March 16, 1964, and is buried in the Jesuit cemetery on campus. His Medal of Honor resides in the Archives at The College of the Holy Cross. In 1956, O'Callahan wrote an account of the attack titled I was Chaplain on the Franklin. His service is also recounted in the story \\"Father Joe\\" by his nephew, storyteller Jay O'Callahan. , a U.S. Navy destroyer escort later re-classified as a frigate, was named in his honor.

Its name refers to this two- level structure inherent to sign systems, many of which are composed of these two kinds of elements: 1) distinctive but meaningless and 2) significant or meaningful. Theory Double articulationOccasionally also \\"double segmentation\\". refers to the twofold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into meaningful signs (like words or morphemes), and then secondarily into distinctive elements (like sounds or phonemes). For example, the meaningful English word \\"cat\\" is composed of the sounds /k/, /√¶/, and /t/, which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words \\"tack\\" and \\"act\\", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called phonemes, represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including morphology, syntax, and semantics) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements. History The French concept of double articulation was first introduced by Andr√© Martinet in 1949.Andr√© Martinet, √âl√©ments de linguistique g√©n√©rale, Colin, 1961. The English calque double articulation is sometimes replaced by duality of patterning. According to Charles F. Hockett and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from generativity or productivity (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity). For further discussion, see figurae, as well as Hockett's design features, which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language. Sign languages may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.

His father, a former Colonel in the Army of the Andes, had settled in Chile from Argentina and was a grandson of Patrick Lynch, an emigrant from Galway to Buenos Aires in the 1740s.Argentinian of Irish ancestry, from County Galway His connection to Patrick Lynch makes him a distant relative of Che Guevara. Entering the navy in 1837, at the age of 12, he took part in the Battle of Socabaya (1838), during the War of the Confederation that led to the fall of Marshal Andr√©s de Santa Cruz. Next, he sought a wider field, and saw active service in the First Opium War on board the British frigate HMS Calliope and the third rate ship of the line HMS Blenheim.Oliver Garc√≠a Meza, Los Chinos en la Guerra del Pac√≠fico, Revista Mar He was mentioned in despatches for bravery, and received the grade of midshipman in the Royal Navy. Returning to Chile in 1847, he became a lieutenant. Seven years later he received the command of a frigate, but was later relieved of his command for refusing to allow arrested political suspects on board. The Chincha Islands War saw him again employed, and he was successively maritime Prefect of Valparaiso, colonel of National Guards, and finally captain and minister of marine in 1872.  War years  At the beginning of the War of the Pacific, Lynch was a Naval Commander. He asked for a position in the navy, but was refused due to the opposition of his fellow officers. He retaliated by asking for a position in the Army, but instead was named as Commander General of Transports, where he was able to show his great abilities as an organizer. In early September 1880, he led a raid against northern Peru to gather ransom payments from business and sugar plantation owners, that has become known as the \\"Lynch Expedition\\". \\"Many Chinese saw the Chilean liberation as an opportunity to avenge years of abuse from the plantation owners; in Pacasmayo 600 to 800 Chinese forced labourers looted the sugar estates and this scene was repeated in the Chicama, Lambayeque and Ca√±ete Valleys. The Chinese also fought alongside the Chileans in the battles of San Juan-Chorrillis and Miraflores, and there was also rioting and looting by non-Chinese workers in the coastal cities. As Heraclio Bonilla has observed; oligarchs soon came to fear the popular clashes more than the Chileans, and this was an important reason why they sued for peace\\". [Source: \\"From chattel slaves to wage slaves: dynamics of labour bargaining in the Americas\\", by Mary Turner.] During the \\"Lynch Expedition\\", he recruited Chinese peons who worked in the haciendas, and was able to convince them to join the army as an auxiliary force, his success in convincing the Chinese to join up was made possible by the Chinese language he had learned in the Opium War. In the final campaign that led to the capture of Lima, he participated in the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores (January 1881), in which he led first a brigade (as colonel) and afterwards a division under General Baquedano. His services at the battle of Chorrillos led to his appointment as Supreme Military and Political Commandant of Peru in 1881. During the time he was Commander of the Army of Occupation, his action in deporting the acting Peruvian president Francisco Garc√≠a Calder√≥n to Chile, excited considerable comment by many Peruvian aristocrats, and the active opposition of the US government that almost led to a military conflict with that country. He returned to his own country in 1883 after the Treaty of Anc√≥n was signed.  Later years  Promoted to rear-admiral, in 1884 he was designated as Chilean minister plenipotentiary (ambassador) to Madrid. His mission was to negotiate a definitive peace treaty with Spain to end the Chincha Islands War. Taking sick, he asked for leave to return to Chile. He died at sea on the return trip, off the Tenerife coast, on 13 May 1886.

Upon its completion in 1925, it was one of the largest heated outdoor swimming pools in the world; it remained open for more than four decades until its closure in 1971. It was eventually demolished in 2000. Construction The pool was built by philanthropist and civic leader Herbert Fleishhacker in 1924, and opened on April 22, 1925. Measuring and holding of seawater, it accommodated 10,000 bathers and at its opening the largest swimming pool in the United States and one of the largest heated outdoor pools in the world. The pool was so large the lifeguards required rowboats for patrol, and was used by the military for drills and exercises. There were rumors of a shark in the pool. There was also a diving pool measuring square and deep and a two-tiered diving tower. The water was provided by a series of pumps and piping at high tide, directly from the Pacific Ocean away, filtered, and heated. The pool's heater could warm of seawater from 60 degrees to 75 degrees Fahrenheit each minute, in theory providing a constant pool water temperature of 72 degrees for AAU swim meets, but in practice tended to vary between 65 and 75 degrees, which many swimmers found chilly. Decline Remains of Fleishhacker Pool Bath House. The building burned down in December 2012. The rubble has been removed and all that remains is the framing around the main entrances. Photo taken from the San Francisco Zoo parking lot, facing west. After years of underfunding and poor maintenance, the pool was showing some deterioration when a storm in January 1971 damaged its drainage pipe. Usage of the pool had been low, and the repair costs exceeded the City's budget, so the pool was converted to fresh water, resulting in poor water quality; it was closed by the end of 1971. In 1999, the San Francisco Zoological Society was granted ownership of the pool house. The swimming pool itself was filled with rocks and gravel, with the space now serving as a parking lot for the zoo. The poolhouse stood derelict and occupied by wildlife and homeless people for many years until it was destroyed by a fire on December 1, 2012. The remaining ruins were demolished, and only a fragment consisting of three ornate entrances remains.

He served as the Liberal Party Whip for a time, and was known as a strong constituency worker. He supported Jim Breithaupt for the Liberal Party leadership in 1982. Worton never operated a riding office, and often met with local voters in his private home. In 2003, a local paper noted that Worton almost never spoke in the legislature, but was strongly respected for his constituency service. Later life Worton died in 2002. During his funeral service at St. George's Anglican Church, former Liberal leader Robert Nixon made the following comments: \\"I found my feet and became productive, but always with Harry's guidance. [...] It was an honour to be with him. I'll never forget him. He was my best friend.\\" Liz Sandals, the newly elected Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Guelph, addressed Worton's legacy in her first speech to the legislature in 2003: :Harry Worton served the people of Guelph and Wellington South as MPP for an astounding 30 years, from 1955 to 1985. When I was in elementary school, I learned that Harry Worton was the MPP. When my kids went to elementary school, they learned that Harry Worton was the MPP. In fact, I suspect that if Harry were still alive and still running, Harry would still be the MPP. Political party really had nothing to do with it. The people of Guelph elected as MP Alf Hales, who was a Conservative and a butcher, and for MPP they voted for Harry Worton, who was a Liberal and a baker. There is no record of the people of Guelph-Wellington ever voting for a candlestick maker to finish off the rhyme. However, even Harry admitted that when he was first elected as alderman in Guelph in 1944, at the age of 23, he was elected because he promised to put more raisins in his buns.

At the 2001 Census the population was recorded as 3,918, increasing to 4,165 at the 2011 census. The community also includes the villages of Walwen and Whelston. There is a lake in the Chubut region of Patagonia, Argentina named after the village; Bagillt Lake. History Bagillt was part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd in the early medieval period. In the 12th century, Owain Gwynedd and his forces retreated to Bryn Dychwelwch, the \\"Hill of Retreat\\", above Bagillt while being pursued by superior numbers of Henry II's forces. Castell Hen Blas, a motte-and-bailey castle, lies within the boundaries of Bagillt. It was the birthplace of Dafydd ap Llywelyn, Prince of Wales, probably around Easter 1212. The castle ruins were partially excavated in the mid-1950s. Dafydd's birth was commemorated by the unveiling of a plaque on the wall of the Upper Shippe Inn in the centre of the village on 25 July 2010; this was 770 years since the issue of his earliest surviving charter as prince. Mostyn Hall, the seat of one of the oldest Welsh families, lies close to Bagillt. Parts of the building date from the time of Henry VI in the 15th century. The future Henry VII is said to have been concealed in the Hall by the lord of Mostyn, Richard ap Howel, during the reign of Richard III. The Hall now houses antiquities and manuscripts pertaining to British and Welsh history that were brought from Gloddaeth Hall, Llanrhos. =Industrial Revolution= The Gadlys Lead Smelting Works was established by Edward Wright and his associates, who were generally Quakers, in 1704. Organised as the London Lead Company, they kept the workshop open until 1799. John Freame, one of the founders of Barclays Bank, was involved in this initiative.John Freame (1665-1745) accessed 18 February 2013 left By the late 18th century, Bagillt had become a centre of mineral extraction and manufacturing. Hundreds of men laboured in eleven collieries that surrounded the village. There was also a factory and works that produced and refined zinc, lead and iron. Bagillt already had several quays on the banks of the River Dee, where fishing boats had moored for centuries. But by the early 19th century, these had grown into docks where cargo destined for the factories and foundries of England were loaded. In 1846, navvies laying track for the North Wales Coast Line reached Bagillt. The Chester and Holyhead Railway officially opened on 1 May 1848. The local mines and works that had used these wharves now switched to haulage by steam train. Bagillt railway station had extensive sidings and goods yard. It closed in 1966. In 1879 a working men's club and cocoa house was built on the High Street in the Pentre area by public subscription. The building was named the Foresters Hall; it is an impressive three-storey red brick building which is supported by the Bagillt Heritage Society. It was built to promote temperance and was originally associated with the Foresters Friendly Society. It was the first cocoa house built in Wales. But the industrial age created problems: in 1848, the same year the railway opened, a book was published in London entitled Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales. It detailed the poverty and hard living of many people in Bagillt and the Flintshire coalfields in the 19th century: Bagillt remained a hard-working boom town for more than a century. For instance on 31 May 1873, a local newspaper, the Wrexham Advertiser, reported that so many new coal workings had opened near Bagillt that it was becoming difficult to find enough miners to work in them: In July 1897 work commenced at Boot End, Bagillt, on the huge Milwr Tunnel which would drain water from the mines working the lead lodes under Pentre Halkyn. Digging started at a point below high-water mark on the Dee foreshore. The tunnel was driven southwest at a gradient of 1:1000. It was brick-lined where it passed through coal measures and shale but unlined after the first 1.5 miles where it passed through chert and limestone. In 1908 the tunnel was draining more than 1.7 million gallons of water per day through the drainage channel and into the river at Bagillt. Bagillt was also the site of the Hawarden Iron Works, situated near the Dee Bank Quay. It was famous for production of a number of waterwheels, including the Snaefell Wheel at Laxey, Isle of Man. But by the 1930s the Great Depression had brought hardship and misery to the area as many of the manufacturing works and collieries were closed. Large numbers of people were now out of work and in severe financial hardship. The days of industrial might have ended in Bagillt. The area was now falling into long-term decline. Before the Second World War many people left in search of work: some moved to cities like Cardiff, Manchester and Liverpool while others went overseas to Canada and America.St Mary's Church in Bagillt =Present day= Today Bagillt and Greenfield remain areas where unemployment, social deprivation and child poverty are key issues. A report in 2004/05 called Flintshire Childcare Sufficiency Assessment concluded that child care was needed to help parents. According to North Wales Police, the overall crime rate in Bagillt East rose by 200% from 2007 to 2008; in Bagillt West this figure was only +3.7% in the same period. In 2013, Bagillt was formally twinned with Laxey, Isle of Man, after a visit to Laxey by members of Bagillt Heritage Society to see the Snaefell Wheel (now renamed the Lady Evelyn) recently restored by the Laxey and Lonan Heritage Trust. The wheel was built in Bagillt (see above). For elections to Flintshire County Council Bagillt is divided into the wards of Bagillt East and Bagillt West, which each elect one county councillor. Bagillt Railway Station The North Wales Coast Line formerly served Bagillt railway station, but the station is no longer in use, having been closed in 1966 due to the Beeching cuts. Trains now run fast through the location, although the station's footbridge still remains to this day. Amenities Bagillt lies on a former section of the A548 road. A by-pass was built in the late 1960s for the A road. Facilities include a community-run library, reopened in 2014 following closure by Flintshire County Council in 2011, a few local shops, pubs and parkland. The Wales Coast Path passes through Bagillt by the side of the River Dee, and the Bagillt Heritage Society have signposted a Heritage and Industrial Trail from the Wales Coast Path to various sites around the village. The Bagillt Heritage Society also acquired the old sewage works near the site of the former Bagillt Railway Station for a future Community Gardens Project. Bagillt is home to two county primary schools, Ysgol Merllyn, located in the main village area, and Ysgol Glan Aber, in Bagillt Boot End.

It is part of the canton of Capellen. , the commune of Koerich has a population of 2,310. The other small communities in the commune are Goeblange, Goetzingen and Windhof. With its onion-towered church standing above the ruins of the medieval castle, Koerich has a particularly attractive rural setting although it is only 15 km west of Luxembourg City. Location The village lies in the valley of the Goeblange stream which flows down to the River Eisch to the west. It is at the junction of the CR 109 to Goeblange and Capellen and the CR 110 to Windhof and Dippach. The centre of the village is 295 m above sea level while the residential developments to the north and south rise to a height of 320 m. The streets in the village are therefore very hilly. The surrounding countryside is a mixture of forests and open fields with mixed farming. History Goeblange: Ruins of the Roman Villa Rustica The commune has a history extending back some 2,000 years. There is strong evidence that the Romans inhabited the area between the 1st and 4th centuries. To the south at Windhof the commune borders on the Kiem or Roman road from Trier to Reims and to the north-west, in the Miecher forest near Goeblange, impressive remains of a Roman farming community have been found. Two large villas have been excavated and the foundations partially rebuilt.Goeblange from Stefan Ramseier's Roman diaries. Retrieved 16 November 2007 There are other buildings and fortifications on the site which are now being uncovered. According to the commune's website, the first documentary reference to Koerich was in 979 but it was not until the 12th century that its two castles were built: the Fockeschlass of which all traces have disappeared though it is shown on the first cadastral map in 1771; and the Grevenschlass whose ruins still dominate the centre of the village.Pr√©sentation - Histoire from the commune's official site . Retrieved 16 November 2007. =The castle= Koerich Castle The Grevenschlass, now known as Koerich Castle, was built by Wirich I, Lord of Koerich and Seneschal of Luxembourg at the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century in late Romanesque style. It was expanded in 1304 by Godefroid of Koerich. The watchtower, now 11 m tall, was certainly much higher when it was built. Surrounded by a moat, the castle originally had a fortified entrance with a portcullis. From 1380, Gilles of Autel and Koerich converted the stronghold into a more comfortable residence by building two 12-m towers at either end of the south wall. The south-western tower which still stands, houses a chapel on the ground floor. In 1580, the new owner Jacques de Raville made further changes, demolishing part of the property and adding two Renaissance wings. The stately fireplace on the first floor and large rectangular windows testify to the castle's palatial splendor at the time. The south wing was again altered in 1728, this time with baroque additions. After the death of the Ravilles in the second half of the 18th century, the castle started to fall into ruin owing to lack of maintenance. In 1950, Pierre Flammang, the last private owner, carried out some essential structural repairs before the castle finally came into the hands of the State.R. Krantz and N. Quintus: Untersuchungen √ºber zwei Burgen in Koerich. Retrieved 16 November 2007. Today major repairs are in progress. =The church= There appears to have been a church in Koerich as long ago as the 12th century when there were references to Saint Remigius, its patron saint. In 1610, the existing church was pulled down and in its place, a new structure was built in Renaissance style. Various additions in Renaissance and baroque were made over the next hundred years; a tower, various lateral chapels in the choir, an impressive high altar, furnishings in the nave and, in 1727 a baroque tower. A huge bell was added in 1778. Finally, the tower was crowned with its distinctive onion-shaped spire in 1791. Apart from a new organ in 1969, there have been no further major additions. The church was fully restored in the early 1990s.Henri Mauer: Die Dekanatskirche von Koerich. Retrieved 17 November 2007. Koerich today Although Koerich still has a distinctly rural atmosphere, it has over the past 30 years become increasingly popular as a residential area. Many new properties, both detached houses and apartment buildings, have been constructed in and around the village. New shops and caf√©s have also opened but the nearest supermarket is in Capellen, some 5 km away. Fortunately for its residents, the village of Koerich has not attracted new businesses. By contrast, Windhof, 2 km to the south has become a major new centre of business activity.

They were built in six production sets, named H1 to H6, from 1965 to 1990 in Thunder Bay, Ontario, for the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The first five sets were manufactured by Hawker Siddeley Canada until 1979, when the company was purchased by the Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC), which then took over production. They operated alongside their predecessor models, the M series, while the H6 trains replaced the last remaining G-series trains in 1990. All H-series cars were manufactured in a facility Hawker-Siddeley inherited from Canadian Car and Foundry, which had earlier produced PCC streetcars for the TTC's streetcar network. The facility was taken over by Bombardier Transportation in 1991, which has continued to produce all subsequent rolling stock for the subway. They include the successor of the H series, the T series, introduced in 1996 and which replaced earlier H-series (H1, H2, and the prototype H3) trains by 1999. The remaining H4, H5, and H6 trains were replaced between 2011 and 2014 by the newest model, the Toronto Rocket. History air-conditioning systems. Interior of an H6 subway car with individual vinyl orange covered seats. Based on the M1, the early H-series cars improved on the design, notably by enlarging the operator's cab and using a single-handle controller. Revisions were made to the designs, and each production model in the H series improved on the last. The H5s were the first subway cars in the TTC fleet to use \\"chopper controls\\" and were also the first cars with regenerative braking and air-conditioning systems. They had a brighter and more modern passenger interior. Black vinyl seats were replaced by red fabric seats. Individual seats replaced the padded bench seats used on previous models. The interior colour scheme consisted of red floors, cream walls, yellow doors and panels, and brown simulated wood grain panels. The H6s replaced the original red G-class cars and were used almost exclusively on the Bloor-Danforth line, with no further H-Series orders made. The H6s were similar to the H5s, but had light brown floors, and orange doors and panels. A prototype T-series car was built by UTDC in 1990‚Äì1991, and evaluated by the TTC. By the time the TTC was ready to order new cars in 1992, UTDC had been sold to Bombardier. Bombardier added new technology such as AC propulsion to a platform based on the predecessor H-cars. 48 cars based on the H1 model were built and used for the Expo Express in Montreal, Quebec for Expo 67. 108 modified H6 cars were produced for the Ankara Metro by Bombardier in 1996‚Äì1997.  Retirement and future  The H1 and H2 cars were replaced by the T1-class cars. The last 12 remaining H1 cars were retired on November 29, 1999. All of the H2 cars were retired by September 28, 2001. Nearly all H1 and H2 cars were scrapped, although several H1 cars are used as subway work vehicles. Some H4 cars were retired when T1-series cars were delivered. In 2006, the TTC placed an order with Bombardier Transportation for the first 39 articulated Toronto Rocket (TR) trains to be operated on the Yonge‚ÄìUniversity- Spadina (YUS) line. This allowed the TTC to retire the remaining H4 and H5 cars. A contract option was exercised in 2010, when the TTC ordered 31 additional new TR trains making 70 trains in total. This allowed for the retirement of the H6 subway cars on the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line and to have enough new TR trains available for the opening of the YUS line extension to Vaughan. With the arrival of the articulated TR trains in 2011, many T1-series trains were transferred from the YUS line to the Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line. This allowed for the retirement of the H4 cars, between the fall of 2011 until January 27, 2012, when the last H4 train made its last run during the morning rush on the Bloor-Danforth line. The H4s were expected to be scrapped at Future Enterprises in Hamilton, Ontario, although some H4 cars were retained for use as maintenance trains. The H5 trains were replaced shortly thereafter by the arrival of more TR-series trains. The last H5 train made its final service run on June 14, 2013, with a round-trip on the YUS line. That trip began at Wilson station en route to Finch station. On the return trip, the train encountered technical difficulties at Eglinton West station, meaning the train had to go out of service. While many H5 subway cars were scrapped, some cars were sent to the United States for refurbishing and were expected to be shipped to the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority of Nigeria for the Eko Rail project. The H6s were the only version of the H series still in service when, on June 20, 2014, the last H6 train took its final run on Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth. The round-trip began at Greenwood station, and headed eastbound to Kennedy station, then westbound to Kipling station and back to Kennedy station where the train was decommissioned. This marked the end of all remaining H-series subway trains which had been in service with the TTC after 49 years. (The H6s were replaced by more T1s which had been transferred from the YUS line to the Bloor-Danforth line following the arrival of more TR trains) It was reported that some H6 cars were to be sold to the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority for use on a new Lagos Light Rail project (along with some of the already-retired H5 cars). However, TTC officials later announced that the deal had been cancelled. Only 75 H5 cars were shipped to Lagos following their retirement in 2013 and all of the H6s were scrapped after retirement in 2014. However, the 75 H5 cars sent to the United States were scrapped in August 2015 after Eko Rail decided to purchase newly made cars from the Chinese rolling stock company CRRC Dalian. * H1: 5336‚Äì5499 * H2: 5506‚Äì5575 * H3: 5500‚Äì5505 (experimental/modified versions of the H2 that led to development of the H5) * H4: 5576‚Äì5663 * H5: 5670‚Äì5807 * H6: 5810‚Äì5935 =Work cars= Only a few H1- and H4-series cars were refurbished and converted to work cars with the TTC: *Four H1 cars (5388‚Äì5391) were destroyed by fire at the Christie station in October 1976.

They were built by Montreal Locomotive Works in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from 1961 to 1962. They were the first Toronto subway cars to be manufactured in Canada, and only one of two series built outside Ontario. History By 1960, the Toronto Transit Commission was preparing to expand its subway system to include the University line. The TTC wanted subway cars with a larger design and also wished to expand upon some of the experimental features in the existing G-series cars. The new design was pushed forward by GM John G. Inglis. A total of only 36 M-series cars were built. As the subway expanded and more trains were necessary, the TTC turned to Hawker Siddeley to build the next series of subway cars. =Design= The TTC performed testing at St. Clair and Union stations with a 75-foot test vehicle known as the Duncan Dragon. Built at the Duncan Shops by Len Bardsley and the D&D; Equipment, the test car consisted of two trucks with three panels and was designed to test the size of train that could successfully navigate the tunnels. A steel girder with railings allowed workers to walk and ride the car during tests. After specifications for the new cars were finalized, Alco's Montreal Locomotive Works was contracted to build the new cars, dubbed \\"M1\\". The cars are historically notable as the first subway cars produced in Canada and, at the time of their construction, the longest subway cars in the world. All subsequent TTC cars have followed the size and length specifications of the M series (though the Toronto Rocket deviates from the two-car married-pair formation) and influenced several other transit authorities to examine the use of longer cars. =Retirement= The M1 trains were decommissioned and scrapped in 1999, with cars 5300 & 5301 given to the Halton County Radial Railway museum for preservation.

As the only Toronto subway cars to be manufactured outside of Canada, its design was mainly influenced by the Q38 and R stocks of the London Underground. Since the TTC's original concept for the subway system foresaw the use of rapid transit cars derived from the President's Conference Car (PCC) design of its streetcar network, the cars were also equipped with bulls- eye incandescent lighting similar to that of a PCC, and a small operator's cabin located in the front left corner of each car. To this end, it was influenced by the 6000-series cars used on the Chicago \\"L\\", felt through the work of DeLeuw, Cather & Co. of Chicago, whom the TTC contracted as a consultant for the rapid transit project. The G-series cars were frequently described as \\"robust and reliable\\", despite being constructed overweight and energy-inefficient.

The G3-class cars were built as \\"non- driving motors\\" in that they had motorized trucks but were equipped with an operator's cab without driving controls and thus could only be used in the middle of the train. The G cars were originally designed in 2-car \\"married pair\\" formations, and were run in trains consisting of 2, 3 or 4 sets (4, 6 or 8 cars). When the G3-class non-driving cars were introduced in 1956, 14 pairs of the G3-class cars were inserted between G1-class cars to form semi- permanently coupled 4-car trainsets, which could be coupled to the 2-car sets or operated on their own.

The relative difference in energy and diffusity of the atomic orbitals of sulfur compared to carbon results in poor overlap of the orbitals and the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO is thus reduced for C=S relative to C=O.Sustmann, R.; Sicking, W.; Huisgen, R. \\"A Computational Study of the Cycloaddition of Thiobenzophenone S-Methylide to Thiobenzophenone\\". J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 14425-14434. The striking blue appearance of thiobenzophenone is due to œÄ‚Üí œÄ* transitions upon the absorption of light with a wavelength of 314.5 nm. Preparative methods Thiones are usually prepared from ketones using reagents that exchange S and O atoms. A common reagent is phosphorus pentasulfide and the related reagent Lawesson's reagent. Other methods uses a mixture of hydrogen chloride combined with hydrogen sulfide. Bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide has also been employed. Solution and solid samples of thiobenzophenone. The blue color is consistent with a small HOMO-LUMO gap associated with the thiocarbonyl functional group. Thiobenzophenone [(C6H5)2CS] is a stable deep blue compound that dissolves readily in organic solvents. It photooxidizes in air to benzophenone and sulfur. Since its discovery, a variety of related thiones have been prepared. =Thiosulfines= Thiosulfines, also called thiocarbonyl S-sulfides, are compounds with the formula R2CSS. Although superficially appearing to be cumulenes, with the linkage R2C=S=S, they are more usefully classified as 1,3-dipoles and indeed participate in 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions. Thiosulfines are proposed to exist in equilibrium with dithiiranes, three-membered CS2 rings. Thiosulfines are often invoked as intermediates in mechanistic discussions of the chemistry of thiones. For example, thiobenzophenone decomposes upon oxidation to the 1,2,4-trithiolane (Ph2C)2S3, which arises via the cycloaddition of Ph2CSS to its parent Ph2CS.

Walmsley and W. Lyons for their manufacturing business. They were in partnerships: * Swallow Sidecar Company 1922-1926 * Swallow Sidecar and Coachbuilding Company 1926-1927 * Swallow Coachbuilding Company 1927-1930 Then shareholders together in the limited liability company with the name * Swallow Coachbuilding Company Limited operating with effect from October 1930, liquidated in 1934 after the purchase of its business by SS Cars Limited. Swallow Sidecar and Coachbuilding Company, and Swallow Coachbuilding Company were trading names used by Walmsley & Lyons, partners and joint owners of a British manufacturer of motorcycle sidecars and automobile bodies in Blackpool, Lancashire (later Coventry, Warwickshire), before incorporating a company in 1930 to own their business, which they named Swallow Coachbuilding Company Limited. Under co-founder William Lyons, its business continued to prosper as S.S. Cars Limited and grew into Jaguar Cars Limited. The sidecar manufacturing business, by then owned by a different company, Swallow Coachbuilding Company (1935) Limited, was sold by Jaguar in January 1946 to an aircraft maintenance firm, Helliwell Group. Lyons and Walmsley The business was founded by two friends, William Walmsley (aged 30) and William Lyons (aged 20).At that time, as a minor until he was 21 (later 18), Lyons was unable to enter a proper binding business contract without specific court approval under a law for the protection of young people. Their partnership became official on Lyons's 21st birthday, 4 September 1922. Both families lived on the same street in Blackpool, England. Walmsley had previously been making sidecars and bolting them onto reconditioned motorcycles. Lyons had served his apprenticeship at Crossley Motors in Manchester before moving to a Blackpool Sunbeam dealer, Brown & Mallalieu, as a junior salesman. Their business partnership was known by three successive trading names: Swallow Sidecar Company, Swallow Sidecar and Coachbuilding Company, and Swallow Coachbuilding Company. In 1930, a limited liability company was incorporated to own their business. Sidecars =Swallow Sidecar= Lyons, having recognised the commercial potential for these sidecars, joined Walmsley and together they found premises in Bloomfield Road, Blackpool using a ¬£1,000 bank overdraft obtained with the assistance of their respective fathers. With a small team of employees they were able to begin commercial production of the motorcycle sidecars. Soon they had to rent more space nearby. Then they needed still more room. Walmsley's father bought a big building in Cocker Street Blackpool which they moved into and with all the extra space began to offer to repair and paint cars and fit new hoods and upholstery. They added coach building to their business name. Automobile bodies =Swallow Sidecar and Coachbuilding= The first car that Lyons and Walmsley worked on intending to build and sell it in any quantity was the Austin 7, a popular and inexpensive vehicle. For their show car Swallow's Bolton, Lancashire agent had persuaded a dealer in Bolton to supply him under- the-counter (coachbuilders required Austin's prior approval or warranties might be voided) with an Austin 7 chassis. Lyons, with a sketch of what he wanted, commissioned Cyril Holland, a coachbuilder by trade, to create a distinctive, open two seater body. Holland gave it a detachable hardtop with a characteristic back window. The result was announced to public in May 1927, the Austin Seven Swallow. Austin gave their approval to the Swallow coachwork though adjustments were needed, the wings kept falling onto the tyres and the cycle type was dispensed with in favour of the more usual shape. In that form it was taken to London and shown to Henlys ‚Äî Bert (Herbert Gerald) Henly and Frank Hough ‚Äî who ordered 500 both two-seaters and saloons. 1929 open 2-seater by Swallow on an Austin Seven chassis Priced at only ¬£175, the Swallow, with its brightly coloured two-tone bodywork and a style that imitated the more expensive cars of the time, proved popular in the prosperous late twenties and in the following depression. Soon after, a saloon version was produced: the Austin Seven Swallow Saloon. =Swallow Coachbuilding= During 1927 the \\"Sidecar\\" was dropped from the name, and it became the Swallow Coachbuilding Company. =Coventry= Standard Big Nine chassis The increasing demand for Swallows made it necessary to move the company closer to the heart of the British car industry and so, in 1928, they moved to a part-disused First World War munitions factory at Holbrook Lane, Coventry. Business continued to grow and in 1929 the owners were confident enough to go to the expense of taking a stand at the London Motor Show. Three new Swallow models appeared in 1929 on Standard, Swift, and Fiat chassis. Also in 1929 John Black and William Lyons realised a long-standing dream and produced a one of a kind sports car, This \\"First\\" SS (Standard Swallow) was a sleek Boat Tail Roadster with a flowing, streamlined design and pointed to an obvious attempt at making a fast car, possibly with the intention of venturing into racing. This car is believed to have been shipped to Australia in the late 40s. ;1931 Swallow 2-door 4-seater saloon on an Austin Seven chassis Image:Austin_Seven_Swallow_1931_front.jpg Image:Austin_Seven_Swallow_1931_rear.jpg Image:Austin_Seven_Swallow_1931_grille.jpg Image:Austin_Seven_Swallow_1931_ornament.jpg  Swallow Coachbuilding Company Limited =Hornet= Wolseley Hornet chassis Bodies on the Wolseley Hornet chassis fitted in well with Swallow's planned new product range. They were the first 6-cylinder Swallows. Production began in January 1931 with an open 2-seater. A 4-seater car followed in that autumn. In April 1932 the new Special chassis arrived and these cars were quite popular. They were the last of the special-bodied Swallows, whose production was replaced in the summer of 1933 by their SS 1 tourer first announced in March 1933. :Production: * Special Hornets: 2-seaters ‚Äî 21; 4-seaters ‚Äî 185 * standard Hornets: 2-seaters ‚Äî 100+; 4-seaters ‚Äî 224 (the quantity of 2-seaters made in the first part of 1931 is unknown) Advertising slogan for the Wolseley Hornet-Swallow cars: \\"The Swallow touch that means so much\\". =S S One= SS 1 tourer on a 1933 Standard Motor Company chassis Engines and chassis supplied by the Standard Motor Company were fitted with Swallow bodies styled under Lyons supervision. The first of the SS range of cars available to the public was the 1932 SS 1 with 2-litre or 2¬Ω-litre side-valve, six-cylinder engine and the SS 2 with a four-cylinder 1-litre side-valve engine. Initially available as coup√© or tourer a saloon was added in 1934, when the chassis was modified to be 2 inches (50 mm) wider. The success of the new range brought about a number of changes. William Walmsley wished to leave this business and it was decided to replace Walmsley's capital by bringing new outside shareholders into a brand- new incorporation, S. S. Cars Limited. The new company technically commenced business on 1 February 1934 following its incorporation 26 October 1933. Subsequently, S. S. Cars Limited bought the shares of Swallow Coachbuilding Limited as of 31 July 1934 and Swallow was liquidated (wound up) before S. S. issued shares to the public in January 1935. After Swallow =SS Cars Limited= The continued success and expansion of their SS Jaguar range, in particular the sports and saloon cars announced in late 1935 would lead to its new name: =Jaguar Cars Limited= Towards the end of the war on 23 March 1945 the SS Cars Limited shareholders in general meeting agreed to change the company's name to Jaguar Cars Limited. Said Chairman William Lyons \\"Unlike S.S. the name Jaguar is distinctive and cannot be connected or confused with any similar foreign name.\\" Sidecar production was now by Swallow Coachbuilding Co. (1935) Ltd. of Albion Road, Birmingham, 11. =Helliwell= 1954 Swallow Doretti by Swallow Coachbuilding (1935) In January 1946 the Helliwell Group, an aircraft maintenance firm, bought Swallow Coachbuilding Company (1935) Limited from Jaguar Cars Limited. Sidecars produced at Helliwells' Walsall Airport works were built in the same way as the originals and used the same patented trademark. They closed shop in the late 1950s.

They were ordered by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in 1992 and built in one production set between 1995 and 2001 by Bombardier Transportation in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Currently based entirely out of Greenwood Subway Yard, the T1s are the older of the two currently active series of rolling stock on the heavy-rail lines in the Toronto subway network. Following the introduction of the newer Toronto Rocket train sets, all T1 trains now operate exclusively in six-car configurations on Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth. They previously operated on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity and in a four-car configuration on Line 4 Sheppard until the retirement of the last remaining H-series trains in 2014 and until the implementation of one-person train operation on the latter in 2016. Design advances The T1 cars entered service between 1996 and 2001 and became the mainstay of the TTC subway fleet. By 1999, they had replaced the older M1s, H1s, H2s and prototype H3s, along with some H4s, many of which had been in revenue service since the 1960s. The T1s had many of the same technical specifications of the H series, including the same married pair configuration, and incorporated many of the design elements that had been refined throughout the H-series program. Each model in the H-series production run improved on the last, adding features such as a single-handle controller for acceleration and braking, air conditioning, a change from camshaft to chopper control, and regenerative braking. The T1 built on those advances (such as changing from a rotary-type to a fore‚Äìaft, joystick-type controller) while integrating new computer technology (analogous to the New Technology Train of the New York City Subway), creating a more modern train. The T-series cars were the first TTC cars to use AC propulsion, rather than DC propulsion as used in all previous rolling stock, all of which are now retired. Other improvements included wider entry and exit doorways, flip-up seats for the installation of wheelchair positions (which are now marked in blue velour to signify priority seating areas instead of the red velour used for other seats), and the removal of vertical stanchions along the car's centre line, making them the TTC's first subway cars to be wheelchair-accessible. The interior colour scheme consists of grey floors and walls and dark red doors and panels, unlike the simulated woodgrain panels used on the predecessor H-series cars. Lines services * Yonge‚ÄìUniversity line (1995‚Äì2015) * Bloor‚ÄìDanforth line (1995‚Äìpresent) * Sheppard line (2002‚Äì2016) Future The T1s have a life expectancy that allows them to remain in service until at least 2026;https://ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2015/June_22/Reports/PAA_to_modify_4_Toronto_Rocket_Train_Sets.pdf however, at the end of 2019, the TTC proposed an overhaul to extend the T1 fleet's life by 10 years. The TTC started implementing mid-life upgrades for the fleet including LED-type interior lighting, along with side LED destination signs and external pre-boarding route and destination announcements. As of 2019, the TTC is in the process of installing CCTV cameras on the remaining T1 subway fleet. The TTC also considered upgrading the fleet to run on an automatic train control (ATC) system, which it is in the process of installing to replace the current wayside signaling system on Lines 1 and 4 and is expected to install on Line 2 by 2020 in conjunction with the opening of the Scarborough subway extension. However, due to prohibitively expensive costs of such a retrofit, it is unlikely that this will happen in the near future, and the TTC plans to replace all T1 trains with new ATC- compatible equipment instead.

It runs north to south along the path of the watercourses, with Birstall to the west and Thurmaston to the east. The parks provide bird watching, fishing and watersports facilities, and are managed by a partnership of Leicestershire County Council, Leicester City Council and Charnwood Borough Council.Leicestershire County Council : Watermead Country Park Retrieved 9 January 2010 The park includes three Local Nature Reserves, Reedbed - Watermead Country Park (North), Watermead Country Park - South and Birstall Meadows. The northernmost lake is named John Merricks Lake, after the late John Merricks, a silver Olympic medallist who competed in sailing events on a nearby lake as a schoolboy. He died in a car accident in 1997. Further south is King Lear's Lake, a popular fishing lake which can be circumnavigated and is popular with people walking dogs and cyclists. A statue on the western side of the lake depicts the final scene of Shakespeare's play King Lear. The lake is also used for open water swim training by Leicester Triathlon Club, and for water training of Newfoundland Dogs. There are several further artificial lakes continuing south following the course of the canal ending with the southernmost lake, often referred to as the Mammoth lake due to the presence of a large statue of a Mammoth atop a small hill aside the lake, from where one can see Leicester and the surrounding area for some distance in either direction. There was a previous woolly mammoth where the current one stands, although it was burned down in an arson attack several years ago. The Millennium Mammoth was built to commemorate the discovery of ice age mammoth remains found when Watermead was a quarry.

It is an important test in the evaluation of patients at risk from glaucoma. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Methods  The slit lamp of a Goldmann tonometer Semicircles seen during Goldmann tonometry through slit lamp =Applanation tonometry= In applanation tonometry the intraocular pressure (IOP) is inferred from the force required to flatten (applanate) a constant area of the cornea, for the Imbert-Fick law. The Maklakoff tonometer was an early example of this method, while the Goldmann tonometer is the most widely used version in current practice. Because the probe makes contact with the cornea, a topical anesthetic, such as proxymetacaine, is introduced on to the surface of the eye in the form of an eye drop. Goldmann tonometry Goldmann tonometry is considered to be the gold standard IOP test and is the most widely accepted method. A special disinfected prism is mounted on the tonometer head and then placed against the cornea. The examiner then uses a cobalt blue filter to view two green semicircles. The force applied to the tonometer head is then adjusted using a dial connected to a variable tension spring until the inner edges of the green semicircles in the viewfinder meet. When an area of has been flattened, the opposing forces of corneal rigidity and the tear film are roughly approximate and cancel each other out allowing the pressure in the eye to be determined from the force applied. Like all non-invasive methods, it is inherently imprecise and may need to be adjusted. Perkins tonometer The Perkins tonometer is a type of portable applanation tonometer, which may be useful in children, anesthetised patients who need to lie flat, or patients unable to co-operate with a sitting slit lamp examination, that yields clinical results comparable to the Goldmann. =Dynamic contour tonometry= The PASCAL dynamic contour tonometer Dynamic contour tonometry (DCT) uses the principle of contour matching instead of applanation. The tip contains a hollow the same shape as the cornea with a miniature pressure sensor in its centre. In contrast to applanation tonometry it is designed to avoid deforming the cornea during measurement and is therefore thought to be less influenced by corneal thickness and other biomechanical properties of the cornea than other methods but because the tip shape is designed for the shape of a normal cornea, it is more influenced by corneal curvature. The probe is placed on the pre-corneal tear film on the central cornea (see gallery) and the integrated piezoresistive pressure sensor automatically begins to acquire data, measuring IOP 100 times per second. The tonometer tip rests on the cornea with a constant appositional force of one gram. When the sensor is subjected to a change in pressure, the electrical resistance is altered and the tonometer's computer calculates a change in pressure according to the change in resistance. A complete measurement cycle requires about eight seconds of contact time. The device also measures the variation in pressure that occurs with the cardiac cycle. =Electronic indentation tonometry= Electronic indentation tonometers are modified Mackay-Marg tonometers that use a free floating transducer to detect the transmitted pressure. The transducer is surrounded by an outer ring that flattens the adjacent cornea reducing its influence on measurement. Because the device touches the cornea, topical anesthetic eye drops are used to numb the eye but as with non-contact tonometry, these devices are often used in children and non-cooperative patients because of their portability and ease of use. Portable electronic tonometers also play a major role in veterinary tonometry. =Rebound tonometry= Rebound tonometers determine intraocular pressure by bouncing a small plastic tipped metal probe against the cornea. The device uses an induction coil to magnetise the probe and fire it against the cornea. As the probe bounces against the cornea and back into the device, it creates an induction current from which the intraocular pressure is calculated. The device is simple and easy to use and self-use versions are available. It is portable, does not require the use of eye drops and is particularly suitable for children and non-cooperative patients. =Pneumatonometry= A pneumatonometer utilizes a pneumatic sensor (consisting of a piston floating on an air bearing). Filtered air is pumped into the piston and travels through a small ( diameter) fenestrated membrane at one end. This membrane is placed against the cornea. The balance between the flow of air from the machine and the resistance to flow from the cornea affect the movement of the piston and this movement is used to calculate the intra-ocular pressure. =Impression tonometry= Schi√∏tz tonometer Diaton transpalpebral tonometer Impression tonometry (also known as indentation tonometry) measures the depth of corneal indentation made by a small plunger carrying a known weight. The higher the intraocular pressure, the harder it is to push against and indent the cornea. For very high levels of IOP, extra weights can be added to make the plunger push harder. The movement of the plunger is measured using a calibrated scale. The Schi√∏tz tonometer is the most common device to use this principle. =Non- corneal and transpalpebral tonometry= Transpalpebral tonometry refers to methods of measuring intraocular pressure through the eyelid. The Diaton non- corneal tonometer calculates pressure by measuring the response of a free- falling rod, as it rebounds against the tarsal plate of the eyelid through the sclera. The patient is positioned so that the tip of the device and lid are overlying sclera.Dr. Shaun Maria Dacosta, Dr. Babu Rajendran, Dr. Janakiraman P. \\"Comparison of Diaton Tonometry and Non Contact Tonometry in Indian Subjects\\" AIOC PROCEEDINGS 2008 Dec; 260 Non-corneal and transpalpebral tonometry does not involve contact with the cornea and does not require topical anesthetic during routine use. Transpalpebral tonometry may be useful for measuring postsurgery IOP after myopic LASIK ablation because this technique is not influenced by the treatment. The Diaton tonometer still requires further evaluation and is not a substitute or alternative for more established methods. The Diaton tonometer has a large margin of error compared with commonly used tonometers (e.g., GAT) in most patients (including those with ocular hypertension, glaucoma, and glaucoma tube shunts). =Non-contact tonometry= Non-Contact-Tonometer Picker in 1974 Non-contact tonometry (or air-puff tonometry) is different from pneumatonometry and was invented by Bernard Grolman of Reichert, Inc (formerly American Optical). It uses a rapid air pulse to applanate (flatten) the cornea. Corneal applanation is detected via an electro-optical system. Intraocular pressure is estimated by detecting the force of the air jet at the instance of applanation.http://www.mercksource.com Historically, non-contact tonometers were not considered to be an accurate way to measure IOP but instead a fast and simple way to screen for high IOP. However, modern non-contact tonometers have been shown to correlate well with Goldmann tonometry measurements and are particularly useful for measuring IOP in children and other non-compliant patient groups. =Ocular response analyzer= The ocular response analyser (ORA) is a non-contact (air puff) tonometer that does not require topical anaesthesia and provides additional information on the biomechanical properties of the cornea. It uses an air pulse to deform the cornea into a slight concavity. The difference between the pressures at which the cornea flattens inward and outward is measured by the machine and termed corneal hysteresis (CH). The machine uses this value to correct for the effects of the cornea on measurement. =Palpation= Palpation (also known as digital tonometry) is the method of estimating intraocular pressure by gently pressing the index finger against the cornea of a closed eye. This method is notoriously unreliable. Influencing factors =Central corneal thickness (CCT)= The thickness of the cornea affects most non-invasive methods by varying resistance to the tonometer probe. A thick cornea gives rise to a greater probability of an IOP being overestimated (and a thin cornea of an IOP being underestimated), but the extent of measurement error in individual patients cannot be ascertained from the CCT alone.Robert N. Weinreb, James D. Brandt, David Garway-Heath and Felipe A. Medeiros 2007 \\"4th Consensus Meeting:Intra-Ocular Pressure\\" The Ocular Response Analyzer and Pascal DCT Tonometers are less affected by CCT than the Goldmann tonometer.

It has a polygonal body marked with letters or numbers, which indicate the result of each spin. Description Pieter Brueghel's Children's Games (1560) In its earliest form the body was square (in some cases via a stick through a regular six-sided die Teetotum at A.Word.A.Day), marked on the four sides by the letters A (Lat. aufer, take) indicating that the player takes one from the pool, D (Lat. depone, put down) when a fine has to be paid, N (Lat. nihil, nothing), and T (Lat. totum, all), when the whole pool is to be taken. Other accounts give such letters as P, N, D (dimidium, half), and H or T or other combinations of letters. Some other combinations that could be found were NG, ZS, TA, TG, NH, ND, SL and M, which included the Latin terms Zona Salve (\\"save all\\"), Tibi Adfer (\\"take all\\"), Nihil Habeas (\\"nothing left\\"), Solve L (\\"save 50\\") and Nihil Dabis (\\"nothing happens\\"). Joseph Strutt, who was born in 1749, mentions the teetotum as used in games when he was a boy: > When I was a boy, the tee-totum had only four sides, each of them marked > with a letter; a T for take all; an H for half, that is of the stake; an N > for nothing; and a P for put down, that is, a stake equal to that you put > down at first. Toys of this kind are now made with many sides and letters. The teetotum survives today as dreidel, a Jewish game played at Hanukkah, and as the Perinola, a game played in many Latin American countries. Some modern teetotums have six or eight sides, and are used in commercial board games in place of dice. The original 1860 version of The Game of Life used a teetotum in order to avoid the die's association with gambling. A twelve-sided teetotum In literature A teetotum is mentioned by \\"Martinus Scriblerus\\", the pen name of a club of 18th-century satirical writers. In Louisa May Alcott's Rose in Bloom, a character learning to dance says, \\"A fellow must have some reward for making a teetotum of himself.\\" The 19th-century English poet William Ernest Henley wrote the Double Ballade on the Nothingness of Things which opened with the lines: > The big teetotum twirls, And epochs wax and wane As chance subsides or > swirls; But of the loss and gain The sum is always plain. Read on the mighty > pall, The weed of funeral That covers praise and blame, The -isms and the > -anities, Magnificence and shame:-- \\"O Vanity of Vanities!\\" In Lewis Carroll's fantasy Through the Looking-Glass, Alice's movements about the Old Sheep Shop provoke its proprietor (the White Queen transformed into a sheep) to ask, \\"Are you a child, or a teetotum?\\" In Dickens' Our Mutual Friend a line of strange-looking wooden objects sticking out of the river near the Plashwater Weir Mill Lock is described as being \\"like huge teetotums standing at rest in the water\\". (Book IV, chapter 1) In Edgar Allan Poe's 1845 dark comedy short story The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, one of the patients of the asylum is described as believing he had been converted into a \\"tee-totum\\":\\"The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether\\" on poestories.com > \\"And then,\\" said the friend who had whispered, \\"there was Boullard, the tee- > totum.

He was the first Standardbred horse to win A$500,000 in Australia. Pure Steel also won the WA Benson & Hedges Cup four times.Agnew, Max, Silks & Sulkies ‚Äì The Complete Book of Australian and New Zealand Harness Racing, Doubleday, Sydney, 1986, Affectionately known as Steelo, he raced from 1974 until 1983 and won just under $1 million, at a time when competition was strong, with the great horses Paleface Adios and Hondo Grattan as competitors. Background Pure Steel was an Australian bred Standardbred Harness racing horse foaled in 1971. Pure Steel was by Toledo Hanover (USA), his dam Pure Band was by Hundred Proof (USA)from the good mare, Bandbox, winner of the 1947 Inter Dominion. Pure Steel was sold at the Sydney yearling sales for A$2,400. Racing record During his career, Pure Steel won many of Australia's major harness races. He did not win the Inter Dominion, but finished second to Carclew in 1976 and third to Koala King in 1980. After racing only twice as a two-year-old, Pure Steel was prepared for the Western Australian Sires Produce and Western Australian Derby in the 1974/5 season. After finishing second in the Sires Produce, his win in the derby was his first feature race win. As a four-year-old he travelled outside of his home state for the first time when he headed to Adelaide for the 1976 Inter Dominion. After finishing fourth, first and second in his heats, Pure Steel was one of the favourites for the final. The defeat by Carclew lead to a split between owner Russell Roberts and trainer Fred Kersley.A G Hunter Cup winners tribute, www.harnessnet.com.au Pure Steel won 10 of his 22 starts as a five- year-old during the 1976/7 season and was a regular competitor on the inaugural Grand Circuit. After winning the Kilmore Cup, Pure Steel contested the first ever Australian Pacing Championship, finishing second to Markovina. The finish to the race was somewhat controversial as the driver of the winner, Brian Gath, was suspended for an incident during the race but a protest was not successful. After the first of his four Western Australian Pacing Cup wins Pure Steel tackled the A G Hunter Cup for the first time. After two defeats in lead up races at Moonee Valley by Markovina, Pure Steel gained his first Hunter Cup win defeating Paleface Adios and Royal Force. Following a sixth and last place in the Miracle Mile Pace, and a win in the BP Marathon, Pure Steel tried to make up for his second place in the 1976 Interdominion to Carclew at Albion Park in Brisbane. However he finished unplaced in the final. The 1977‚Äì78 season cemented Pure Steel's name amongst the great horses of Australian harness racing. He began the season by winning the Whirlwind Sprint at Moonee Valley in a quick 1:58.5, finished second in the Winfield Cup, also at Moonee Valley, and second in the Kilmore Cup. He then travelled to Adelaide for the Australian Pacing Championship where he won both his heats but could only finish third behind new star Rip Van Winkle in the final. In January Pure Steel won the Western Australian Pacing Cup for the second consecutive year, this time breaking the race record. The following month he travelled to Melbourne for the Hunter Cup and was successful in recording a remarkable staying performance. Pure Steel sat without cover outside of leader Rip Van Winkle for most of the 2800m but won convincingly in track record time. 'The gutsiest thing on four legs' said driver Ted Demmler.Cain, Robert (1988) Kilmore - The Cup That Grew The race is still regarded by many as one of the greatest ever run at Moonee ValleyWA Racing Industry Hall of Fame, Retrieved 26 January 2016 The 1978 Interdominion was the first Interdominion series entirely run from behind the mobile barrier. Pure Steel was strongly favoured at 6/4 for the final before the series began but contracted a virus and did not make the final. After winning the consolation race he headed to Sydney and defeated Paleface Adios in the Miracle Mile. By the end of the season he was leading Australian stakeswinner for the second straight year and the 1977/8 Grand Circuit Champion. Pure Steel began 1978/9 with a second to Koala King in the Winfield Cup and a third from a 35m handicap in the Kilmore Cup. But after a record third win in the Western Australian Pacing Cup defeating Koala King, and a win over local star Nevada Smoke in the South Australian Pacing Cup, he missed the remainder of the big races that season due to injury. Despite the injury he still passed Paleface Adios to become Australian harness racings leading stakeswinner. Only having a limited preparation, he contested the 1980 Western Australian Pacing Cup series and was beaten by new rival Satinover in the first round of heats.Satinover - a Western cult, The Age, 12 March 1980, Retrieved 26 January 2016 It was a 17th consecutive win for Satinover, but after he was injured Pure Steel won the WA Cup final for a record fourth time becoming the leading stakeswinner in Australian racing passing the thoroughbred Family of ManPure Steel wins fourth Benson And Hedges Cup, Canberra Times, 20 January 1980, Retrieved 26 January 2016 and then won the Fremantle Cup from the 35m backmark.

After three unsuccessful Interdominion campaigns, wins in all three rounds of heats indicated that 1980 at Harold Park might be his year. It was not to be, however, with a 15m handicap combined with rivals the quality of winner Koala King and runner-up Locarno too difficult to overcome. On the night of 2 May 1980 Pure Steel took part in one of the most anticipated events in Perth harness racing history, a $50,000 match race with Satinover. Satinover's winning streak had reached 19 and he had defeated Pure Steel at their only meeting. But this time the result was very different with Pure Steel parking outside Satinover for much of the race but still winning convincingly.None tougher than Steelo, www.harnessnet.com.au, Retrieved 25 January 2016 There was a crowd of nearly 20,000 in attendance and sufficient interest in the race for television coverage.Pure Steel defeats Satinover, Canberra Times, 4 May 1980, Retrieved 26 January 2016 He was subsequently voted Australian Harness Horse of the Year. The 1980/1 season began with Pure Steel finishing second in the Winfield Cup for the third time and second off a 30m handicap in the Kilmore Cup. He was then injured during the Australian Pacing Championship in Melbourne. Returning to racing in time for the 1981 Interdominion in Hobart, Pure Steel finished fourth to new sensation San Simeon in the final.

Hills of Chapultepec, delegation Miguel Hidalgo of Mexico City, D.F., Mexico. The Mexican oil expropriation () was the nationalization of all petroleum reserves, facilities, and foreign oil companies in Mexico on March 18, 1938. In accordance with Article 27 of the Constitution of 1917, President L√°zaro C√°rdenas declared that all mineral and oil reserves found within Mexico belong to \\"the nation\\", i.e., the federal government. The Mexican government established a state-owned petroleum company, Petr√≥leos Mexicanos, or PEMEX. For a short period, this measure caused an international boycott of Mexican products in the following years, especially by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, but with the outbreak of World War II and the alliance between Mexico and the Allied powers, the disputes with private companies over compensation were resolved.Jonathan C. Brown, \\"Petrolem: Pre-1938\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, p. 1082. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997. The anniversary, March 18, is now a Mexican civic holiday. Background Venustiano Carranza, President of Mexico, on the recommendations of the Petroleum Technical Commission, promoted the restitution of the wealth of the subsoil to the nation, which had been yielded during the Porfiriato to the land owners by issuing the issuance of the Code of Miner√≠a of 1894 and the law oil company of 1901, both regulations were contrary to Spanish legislative system inherited since colonial times, that had remained in force in Mexico. On August 16, 1935, the Petroleum Workers Union of Mexico (Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana) was formed and one of the first actions was the writing of a lengthy draft contract transmitted to the petroleum companies demanding a 40-hour working week, a full salary paid in the event of sickness, and the payment of 65 million pesos towards benefits and wages. The foreign oil companies refused to sign the agreement, and counter offered with a payment of 14 million pesos toward wages and benefits.Meyer, Lorenzo (2000). ¬´La institucionalizaci√≥n del nuevo r√©gimen¬ª. In Daniel Cos√≠o Villegas et al. Historia general de M√©xico. M√©xico. El Colegio de M√©xico. pp. 823‚Äì880. . On November 3, 1937, the union demanded that the companies sign the collective agreement and on May 17, the union summoned a strike in case their demands were not met. On May 28 the strike became effective throughout the country. The petroleum workers' struggle was well regarded by the President and the population despite problems caused by the petroleum shortage. Due to these problems, the union accepted a lift of the strike on June 9, after the president urged them to present their case before the General Arbitration and Conciliation Board (Junta General de Conciliaci√≥n y Arbitraje). In July, as instructed by the arbitration board, a commission of financial experts was formed that investigated the petroleum companies' finances, concluding that their profits easily permitted them to cover the demands of the workers. The report stated that just one company (El Aguila) had received annual profits of over 55 million pesos. The arbitration board concluded that the oil companies should pay 26 million pesos for wages and benefits to the workers.Silva Herzog, Jes√∫s (2003). ¬´M√©xico y el vampirismo petrolero¬ª. En √ìscar Flores Torres. Historiadores de M√©xico siglo XX. M√©xico: Editorial Trillas. pp. 226‚Äì238. . The companies, however, insisted the demands would cripple production and bankrupt them, and refused to pay. The president once again intervened to mediate between the parties, and met with oil company representatives at the National Palace on September 2. In this meeting, one of the El Aguila representatives took issue with the description of it being a foreign company, and stated that El Aguila was a Mexican company. In response, Jesus Silva Herzog (present in the meeting) responded with a financial newspaper from London that cited a report from the Royal Dutch Shell of 1928: \\"Our Mexican subsidiary, Oil Company El Aguila, has obtained good returns during the last fiscal cycle.\\" It was also explained that El Aguila de Mexico would set the price of an oil barrel at 1.96 when sold to The Eagle Shipping company. This price was below the market value of US$3.19 per barrel. This way profits would be hidden to the Mexican treasury, and taxes were saved.Silva Herzog, Jes√∫s (2003). ¬´M√©xico y el vampirismo petrolero¬ª. En √ìscar Flores Torres. Historiadores de M√©xico siglo XX. M√©xico: Editorial Trillas. pp. 55-56. . L√°zaro C√°rdenas del R√≠o, president of Mexico from 1934 to 1940, implemented a nationalist policy, interceded during the conflict between workers and companies repeatedly, on March 18, 1938, through a speech directed by radio to the nation, released the expropriatory decree. But, on December 8, the companies hired other unemployed workers and had not responded to the arbitration board. On December 18, 1937, the board gave a verdict in favor of the union by means of a \\"laudo\\" (binding judgment in arbitration) which demanded that the companies fulfil the requirements of the petitions and pay 26 million pesos in lost salaries. The petroleum companies initiated a lawsuit on January 2, 1938 before the Mexican Supreme Court to protect their property from the labor union and arbitration board, which denied the request. Consequently, the foreign companies rebelled against the imposed contract, and the maximum Judicial Authority responded by rendering a decision on March 1, giving the companies until March 7 to pay the 26 million pesos penalty. In 1935, all companies in the business of extraction, processing, and exporting of oil in Mexico were foreign companies with foreign capital. These companies attempted to block the creation of labor unions and used legal and illegal tactics to do so. However, the creation of individual unions within each company was made possible, but work conditions differed from one another. On December 27, 1935, the Sindicato √önico de Trabajadores Petroleros was created, despite the legal opposition in the states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz. On January 29, 1936, this union joined the Comit√© de Defensa Proletaria (\\"Committee of Proletarian Defense\\") which would become in February the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). On July 20, the union celebrated its first convention, in which it was proposed a project of general contracts for each oil company and it was decided on a strike to push towards an agreement. L√°zaro C√°rdenas intervened between the union and the oil companies in order to force an agreement on the contract. The strike was delayed for six months, but the companies never agreed to the contract and on May 28, the strike took place. The entire country was paralyzed for 12 days, with consumers unable to buy gasoline. C√°rdenas convinced the union to end the strike until a decision by the companies could be made. However, the companies declared themselves unable to meet the demands because of financial problems. C√°rdenas ordered an investigation and on August 3, and the findings were that the Mexican oil industry produced higher returns than the U.S. oil industry. Legal conflicts After the publication of the findings, the oil companies threatened to leave Mexico and take all of their capital with them. The government entity in charge of the conflict between these companies and the union, the Junta Federal de Conciliaci√≥n y Arbitraje (Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board), was not able to make a decision quickly and the union declared a 24-hour strike in protest on December 8. On December 18, the Arbitration Board declared in favor of the union. The oil companies had to pay 26 million pesos of wages lost because of the strike, but they appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court then rejected the appeal and ordered them to raise salaries and improve working conditions for the union members. The oil companies protested this decision and President C√°rdenas mediated a compromise; the union would accept 26 million pesos. C√°rdenas offered to end the strike if the oil companies paid the sum. According to witnesses of this meeting, representatives of the oil companies asked the President \\"Who can guarantee that the strike will be over\\", to which the President replied \\"I, the President of the Republic.\\" After the businessmen asked with sarcasm \\"You?\\" President C√°rdenas ended the meeting saying \\"Sirs, we are finished!\\".quoted in Enrique Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power. New York: HarperCollins 1997, p. 474 C√°rdenas moved to expropriate the oil industry and create a national oil company, PEMEX. Oil Expropriation Day, March 18, 1938 On March 18, 1938 President C√°rdenas embarked on the expropriation of all oil resources and facilities by the state, nationalizing the U.S. and Anglo-Dutch (Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company) operating companies. Two hours before informing his cabinet of his decision, he made the announcement on the radio to the rest of the country. Five days later, a crowd of 200,000 (according to the press) rallied in the z√≥calo in support of C√°rdenas's action. On April 12, 1938, a crowd of thousands of all classes gathered in front of the Palacio de Bellas Artes to make donations to pay the debt to foreign companies. Donations varied from chickens to jewelry. Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power, p. 475 (see photo). On June 7, 1938, President C√°rdenas issued a decree creating Petr√≥leos Mexicanos (PEMEX), with exclusive rights over exploration, extraction, refining, and commercialization of oil in Mexico. On June 20, PEMEX started operations. Opposition =International= In retaliation, the oil companies initiated a public relations campaign against Mexico, urging people to stop buying Mexican goods, and lobbying to embargo US technology to Mexico. Many foreign governments closed their markets to Mexican oil, hoping that PEMEX would drown in its own oil. However, the U.S. government of Franklin Delano Roosevelt had issued the Good Neighbor Policy, aiming to recalibrate U.S.-Latin American relations; the U.S. government did not intervene to aid U.S. oil companies affected by the Mexican expropriation. Mexican finances suffered due to the boycott, the Mexican peso was devalued, and an immediate 20% increase in prices was suffered by the Mexican population. In a trip to NY to negotiate with oil companies, Mexican treasury minister, Suarez, serendipitously met an American intermediate, William Rhodes Davis from Davis Oil Company, who had a refinery in Europe, and asked for a collaboration. Davis mediated between Mexico and Germany to a barter agreement where Mexico would give crude oil to Davis, who then would provide refined oil products to Germany in exchange for machinery to Mexico.https://libcom.org/library/allied-multinationals-supply-nazi- germany-world-war-2 By 1940, Mexico had an agreement with the American Sinclair Oil Corporation to sell crude oil to the U.S, and the full-scale war in Europe guaranteed that Mexican oil would have international customers.Mexico Between Hitler and Roosevelt : Mexican Foreign Relations in the Age of L Zaro C Rdenas, 1934-1940 by Friedrich E. Schuler; Chapter 5; University of New Mexico Press; 1999; ; PEMEX developed into one of the largest oil companies in the world and helped Mexico become the world's seventh largest oil exporter.http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=mx&v;=88 =Domestic= Saturnino Cedillo, a cacique from San Luis Potos√≠ and former Secretary of Agriculture, showed the strongest opposition to C√°rdenas's measures. Cedillo had in the past supported C√°rdenas in a conflict with ex- President Plutarco El√≠as Calles, but disagreed with his plan of reforms. On May 15 of the same year, the state congress of San Luis Potos√≠ issued a decree where it refused to recognize C√°rdenas as President and declared that the expropiaci√≥n petrolera did not benefit the economy of Mexico. C√°rdenas did not consider this a serious threat and minimized efforts to suppress the rebellion, instead choosing persuasion. The US government did not support the rebellion because it was more concerned that fascist and communist movements from Europe would spread to Mexico. The key to the success of the measures taken by C√°rdenas was not just to control the opposition, but to keep afloat an industry in the absence of qualified personnel. The government had to depend on the Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana (STPRM, or the Union of Oil Workers of the Mexican Republic) to resolve disagreements over the management of oil resources, and deal with threats of strikes and sabotage. In spite of these and technical challenges, local workers who replaced the foreign technicians were successful in making the new nationalized oil industry work. Josephus Daniels, U.S. ambassador to Mexico, explained to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull that C√°rdenas' reforms could not be undone, since his position as president and the position of PEMEX were secure. Critics of the expropriation point out that since Pemex took control of the nation's petroleum, the company has been rife with corruption through every administration since that of C√°rdenas, including both the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and the PAN (Partido Accion Nacional). In addition, the casus belli of the expropriation was a wage hike of 26 million pesos. In fact, in the aftermath, not only was the promised wage hike postponed indefinitely, wages were actually cut.Daniel Yergin, (2009). \\"The Prize, the Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power\\".

Team members =Founding members= J2 J2 is the only minor in the team, Zane Yama is a 15-year-old high school student and the son of the original Juggernaut (Cain Marko) and district attorney Sachi Yama. Picked on by bullies at school, he recently manifested the ability to grow to a huge size, in which he gains super strength and invulnerability. His uniform, which includes his father's favorite flannel shirt tied around his waist over his armor, manifests itself automatically upon metamorphosis. He can only stay this way for about an hour. Mainframe Mainframe. Mainframe is a self-aware computer program, created by Tony Stark, which inhabits a series of identical armors. When an armor is damaged or destroyed, he simply transfers his consciousness to another body. His robot body utilizes Stark technology similar to the one found in the Iron Man armor. His personality is based on his creator's, possibly created by the same process as the Vision's. Stinger Stinger. Dr. Cassandra Lang is the daughter of the second Ant-Man, Scott Lang. Although she is the oldest member, in her mid-20s, and the only one on the team with a professional life and a scientific background, she is still doted on by her father, who constantly worries about her new-found superhero life. She possesses many abilities originally engineered by Henry Pym, including resizing, flying, communication with insects and artificial \\"stingers\\", all based on her costume and helmet. Thunderstrike 18-year-old Kevin Masterson is the son of the original Thunderstrike. He absorbed his father's mace into his body, and has gained the ability to produce \\"thunderclaps\\"; bursts of concussive force from his hands. He can use them to simulate super strength or to propel him in huge Hulk-like leaps. Although he doesn't possess real super strength, he has limited invulnerability. In his civilian identity, he is a college student. =Dream Team= The Dream Team is a fictional group of heroes in the Marvel Comics MC2 universe. They first appeared in A-Next #4, and are based upon the \\"kooky quartet\\" of replacement Avengers introduced in Avengers Vol 1 #16. In their first appearance, Mainframe accepts them as members of the Avengers without consulting the existing members. There is therefore initially some antagonism between the original A-Next team and the Dream Team. The team roster comprises: American Dream Shannon Carter is the niece of Sharon Carter. Her uniform is visually based on Captain America's and includes a set of stun discs (similar to Nomad's) that can be thrown against an opponent. She does not possess any powers, but is an Olympic-level athlete, a skilled fighter and a strategist. American Dream was later rewarded for her dedication by receiving the shield of an alternate-reality Captain America after saving that world from destruction. Bluestreak Blue Kelso is impatient and a person who likes to get to the point.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe (2006) #2. Marvel Comics. Bluestreak has powers to match her nature, namely superspeed. She was once affiliated with the X-People (successor to the X-Men), though she joined the Avengers once she realized she would not get much publicity. Crimson Curse Aerika Harkness is related to the witch Agatha Harkness, former teacher to the Scarlet Witch. Like her ancestor, she possesses control over magical energies, although the exact nature of those energies is not known. They appear similar to the way the Scarlet Witch's powers were originally portrayed, and she appears to control them with relative ease. She died stopping an alternate Doctor Doom from attempting to use the Cosmic Cube to invade the Avengers' Earth. Freebooter Brandon Cross was trained by Hawkeye and Swordsman and has shown proficiency with a variety of weapons as well as athletic skills. His costume takes visual cues from both Hawkeye and the Swordsman. Freebooter was romantically linked to Crimson Curse. =Other recruits= Kate Power Kate Power was originally known as Energizer, the youngest member of Power Pack, a team of pre-teen superheroes made up of herself and her three siblings who gained their powers from a Kymellian named Aelfyre Whitemane. Her abilities involve disintegrating matter, absorbing its energy into herself and unleashing the energy as powerballs.

For the Australian motor racing television show, see Shannons Legends of Motorsport Legends of Motorsport was a series of automotive documentaries aired by the former television channel Speedvision, which later became Speed Channel.  Original Series  The series was attributed to the German automobile firm BMW, implying that they provided some of its key financial backing. The series also included a three-part set of episodes entitled The History of BMW Motorsport. Approximately 200 half-hour episodes were made and aired between the years 1996 and 2000, all based around vintage automobile (and motorcycle) footage. The majority of the episodes consisted of an apparently complete old documentary film (sometimes with scratches) produced by an automotive vendor. Castrol, Girling, Triumph, BRSCC and many others were the producers of those original publicity films. Although wrapped with a modern introduction and interspersed with occasional clarifying breaks, the original narration from the film was used, several of them done by Graham Walker (Murray Walker's motorcycle-racing father). Most of the films focussed on racing. Others focussed on chronicling a firm's history or showing their production methods. Most, if not all, were introduced and elucidated by one of David Hobbs or Alain de Cadenet. For a few episodes, Alain de Cadenet provided narration in addition to introduction and elucidation. In at least one case, Death and Games, Le Mans 1963, this was because the film had been produced in German. In other cases, the film coverage of the topic was probably extracted from several archival sources. In particular, the multi-part set of Legends of Motorsport episodes, entitled \\"Racing in the Fifties\\" had one episode for each year of the 1950s, with footage for each coming from multiple unattributed archival sources.  Speed Channel Series  After Speedvision became Speed Channel in 2002, only about thirty of the episodes were repackaged, to remove the embedded old Speedvision logo, and also to replace the previously very stodgy introductions with something a bit more casual. The new introductions were done exclusively by David Hobbs. These thirty or so episodes continued to be reshown on Speed Channel, usually early every weekday morning, seeming like a sort of homage to the old image of Speedvision. While the BMW attribution was retained, the three episodes documenting their history were never repackaged. Then on February 20, 2006, Speed Channel stopped showing the series altogether. A subsequent check of the Speed Channel web site, on July 18, 2006, revealed the show to be no longer listed on the programs page; its program summary is no longer retrievable.

An estimated 145 workers were killed and 166 injured. Description David Nevins, Sr. was co- owner of the Pemberton Mill at the time of the disaster. The Pemberton Mill, built in 1853, was a five-story building 280 feet long and 84 feet wide. Its chief engineer was Charles H. Bigelow and its construction was financed by John A. Lowell and his brother-in-law J. Pickering Putnam at a cost of $850,000, \\"a fortune for those times\\".The Pemberton Mill Disaster of 1860THE DISASTER AT LAWRENCE. Additional Testimony-Further Subscriptions -Progress in Relieving the Sufferers New York Times, January 21, 1860 During a financial panic in 1857, Lowell and Putnam sold the mill to George Howe and David Nevins, Sr. for a $350,000 loss. The new owners jammed more machinery into their factory attempting to boost its profits. The mill ran with great success, earning $1,500,000 per year, and had 2,700 spindles and 700 looms in operation at the time of the disaster.THE WORKING LADIES OF LOWELL American Heritage MagazineGenealogical and Personal Memoirs Relating to the Families of Boston and Eastern Massachusetts, William Richard Cutter, Lewis historical publishing company, 1908 Collapse Shortly before 5:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon, workers in nearby factories watched with horror as the Pemberton Mill buckled and then collapsed with a mighty crash. According to later court testimony reported by The New York Times, owner George Howe escaped as the structure was falling. Dozens were killed instantly and more than six hundred workers, many of them women and children, were trapped in the twisted ruins. When the winter sun set, rescuers built bonfires to illuminate their efforts, revealing \\"faces crushed beyond recognition, open wounds in which the bones showed through a paste of dried blood, brick dust, and shredded clothing.\\" Around 9:30 p.m., with many people still trapped in the twisted wreck of the factory, someone accidentally knocked over an oil lantern. Flames raced across the cotton waste and splintered wood ‚Äî some of it soaked with oil. One trapped man cut his own throat rather than be consumed by the approaching flames; he was rescued, but died from his other injuries. As the fire grew, rescuers, physicians, families of the trapped victims, and spectators were all driven back by the conflagration. The screams coming from the ruins were soon silenced, leaving rescuers to eventually discover only the burned, smoldering remains of \\"brick, mortar and human bones ... promiscuously mingled\\". The Boston Almanac and Business Directory notes the event by describing that: > The Pemberton Mills at Lawrence, Mass., ... (did) fall-in while nearly 800 > operatives are at work, and bury many in the ruins. About four hours after > the fall, a fire breaks out, and destroys those not extricated from the > ruins. More than 115 people perish by the awful catastrophe, and 165 are > more or less injured. The Boston Globe describes the carnage more vividly: > The scene after the fall was one of indescribable horror. Hundreds of men, > women, and children were buried in the ruins. Some assured their friends > that they were uninjured, but imprisoned by the timbers upon and about them. > Others were dying and dead. Every nerve was strained to relieve the poor > unfortunates, when, sad to relate, a lantern broke and set fire to the > wreck. In a few moments the ruins were a sheet of flames. Fourteen are known > to have been burned to death in the sight of their loved ones, who were > powerless to aid them. American Heritage magazine gives this account of the late-afternoon disaster: > Suddenly there was a sharp rattle, and then a prolonged, deafening crash. A > section of the building's brick wall seemed to bulge out and explode, and > then, literally in seconds, the Pemberton collapsed. Tons of machinery > crashed down through crumpling floors, dragging trapped, screaming victims > along in their downward path. At a few minutes after five, the factory was a > heap of twisted iron, splintered beams, pulverized bricks, and agonized, > imprisoned human flesh. Victims Estimates of the number killed by the collapse and subsequent fire vary from 90 to 145. Most were recent immigrants, either Irish or Scots, many of them young women. A 2002 fictionalization of the disaster recounted: > Flames spread rapidly, and now terror of fire threatened those waiting to be > saved. Mary Bannon, pinned in the wreckage, handed her pay envelope to the > friend comforting her and asked that it get to her father. 'Bid him goodbye > for me,' she said, 'You will be saved; I will not'. While Irish and Scots were the majority, the list of the Pemberton Mill's casualties is indicative of New England's labor force at that time. There were also Yankees from Maine and New Hampshire, immigrants from Germany and Switzerland, and others. All the churches of Lawrence ‚Äî Baptists, Catholic, Congregationalist, Episcopalian, Methodist, Presbyterian, Unitarian, and Universalist ‚Äî had parishioners to console after the disaster. Aftermath The new Pemberton Mill, built shortly after the collapse of the first. The collapse of the Pemberton Mill was determined to have been caused by a number of preventable factors. Ignoring already questionable load limits, extra heavy machinery had been crowded into the upper floors of the factory. Investigators also discovered substandard construction. The brick walls were improperly mortared and supported. The iron pillars supporting the floors were cheap and brittle but had been installed nonetheless. In the wake of the disaster, area ministers delivered \\"sermons on God's inscrutable wrath\\" but it was apparent that blame lay in the manner in which the factory was built and operated. The Scientific American wrote, \\"...there is now no doubt that the fall of the building was owing to the most gross negligence and want of fidelity in casting the columns.\\"The Pemberton Mill to be Re-built Scientific American The tragedy became a rallying point for efforts to improve safety standards in industrial workplaces. It also inspired the popular sketch \\"The Tenth of January\\" by author Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward.Shelton, Pamela L. Feminist Writers. St. James Press, 1996: 382.

Premise On D-Day, a mixed group of forced labourers held by German forces take shelter from the bombardment inside a German bunker, but are then entombed when the entrances are blocked by shelling damage. By coincidence, the bunker is a storehouse, so the prisoners have enough food and wine to last them for years.

It is part of a civil parish which also covers the nearby hamlet of Edmondthorpe. The parish has a population of 623, increasing to 632 at the 2011 census. It is close to the county boundaries with Lincolnshire and Rutland, nearby places being Garthorpe, Teigh (in Rutland) and South Witham (in Lincolnshire). Description The village church is St Peter's; the pub is the Berkeley Arms. There is a windmill that has been converted into a visitor attraction with tea room and craft shops. A part-time mobile Post Office visits the village twice a week. Wymondham has a primary school and a pre-school group. There is also a large playing field named after Sir John Sedley. =Manor= The manor of Wymondham was held by the Hamelin family in the 1200s. The south transept of the parish church had a chantry chapel founded by William Hamelin in 1290, who gave land in Wymondham, Saxby and Thorp Edmer for a chaplain to celebrate mass in perpetuity on his behalf. By 1553 the chantry was no longer in existence possibly as a result of the Reformation when saying masses for the departed was abolished. In the south transept of the church is a monument in the form of a large effigy of a knight, cross-legged, dating from the late 13th century; this was Sir John Hamelin who was supposedly a crusader on three occasions.https://www.leicestershirechurches.co.uk/wymondham-church-st-peter/ Sir John's daughter and heiress, Isabel, carried the manor to her husband, Sir Thomas Berkeley, a son of Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley in whose family it remained for centuries.The Visitation of Leicestershire 1619 made by William Camden, Clarenceux King of Arms, edited by John Fetherston, F.S.A., London, 1870, p.2. Sir Thomas Berkeley (died 1488) was an English lawyer and politician who represented Leicestershire in Parliament and served as Sheriff for Rutland, Warwickshire, and Leicestershire. The public house in Wymondham is named The Berkeley Arms. =St Peter's church= St Peter's Church The parish church dates back to the 13th century and was built in the \\"Early English style on a cruciform plan\\"; the third storey of the tower and the spire are in the Perpendicular style. The church priest is also responsible for Buckminster and Sewstern (South Framland). The church saw the wedding of footballer Michael Carrick and Lisa Roughead in June 2007. =Disused railway= A disused railway line, part of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway branch line between Saxby and Bourne, runs just to the north of the village. The Edmondthorpe and Wymondham railway station closed to passengers in 1959 though the line remained open for ironstone freight, and HM Queen Elizabeth journeyed along it in 1967. The route was also used for holiday trips from Leicester to Skegness. The former goods yard, goods shed, station, Station House and Navvies' Cottage (Grade II Listed) are passed when travelling from the village along Butt Lane towards the windmill. =Stilton cheese= Frances Pawlett (or Paulet), a \\"skilled cheese maker\\" of Wymondham, has traditionally been credited as the person who set modern Stilton cheese's shape and style characteristics in the 1720s, but others have also been named.

Jane's All The World's Aircraft 2004‚Äì2005. is an amphibious seaplane designed by the Beriev and constructed by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO) in Russia. Intended for autonomous operation in the unmarked areas of Russia's far north and Siberia, the Be-103 was designed for short-haul routes in regions that have rivers, lakes and streams, but are otherwise inaccessible. Design and development The Be-103 is a mid-wing monoplane, making use of the modified wing roots as water- displacing sponsons. It features an all-moving slab tail and retractable tricycle landing gear for land operations. Its hallmark and most distinguishing design feature is the water-displacing wing, an unusual feature for a seaplane, with three aquaplaning implements (planing step, port and starboard wing trailing edges) which substantially enhance the aircraft's on- the-water stability and seaworthiness. The Be-103 features include an advanced, blended wing, swept at 22¬∞, with -long fixed leading edge slats, trailing-link main landing gear, and three-bladed MT-12 reverse pitch propellers. Fuel is stored in the wet wings. The aircraft is built from aluminum-lithium alloy with titanium used in high-stress areas. A 30-parameter, five-hour flight data recorder, engine fire-detection systems and an ice detector are also standard, as are hydraulic brakes. However, unlike most modern aircraft, the Be-103 is not equipped with wing flaps. When flying solo, ballast must be placed near the right front seat due to center of gravity issues. =Certification= Be 103 The Be-103 received its Federal Aviation Administration type certification on 21 July 2003 at the EAA AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where the aircraft had arrived via An-124 airlift. The type certificate was handed over by the FAA's co-chairman of regulations and certification, Nicholas Sabatini. The aircraft is also certified in Brazil, the People's Republic of China, the European Union,Type Certificate Data Sheet Nr. IM.A.341 and Russia. On 1 August 2003, FAA Director Marion Blakey visited the Be-103's display area at the exhibition in order to familiarize herself personally with the aircraft and to meet representatives of the developer, manufacturer and Air Register. The obtaining of FAA certification allows official sales of the Be-103 to begin in the US and Canada. After the exhibition, the first production Be-103 aircraft were officially handed over to its American dealer, Kent Linn of Sky Manor Airport in Pittstown, New Jersey. Domestic and international market demands (until 2015) were estimated at 520 and 250‚Äì330 units, respectively.

The game is set in ancient China during the Chu-Han Contention between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu in the 3rd century BC. Gameplay General Liu Bang is preparing his strategy to resolve the siege over an ancient Chinese city. The gameplay and control are quite unlike the similarly themed Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Nobunaga's Ambition series. The commands are set in four weeks during one month. The player must first choose the \\"planning\\" stage where they can decide to improve their cities or make allies. The next week is called the \\"Action\\" stage where the player choose where to move their armies. The player plays as either Liu Bang or Xiang Yu. Liu Bang has below average stats for Politics and Skills however his Charisma is high and hence it is easy for him to make allies, while Xiang Yu has high personal stats while his Charisma is lower. Although the story is set during a five-year span, the player is not penalized if they don't finish the game in less than five years. Reception Reviewing the SNES version, Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that though action lovers would be repelled by the game's pacing, \\"For those who like this type of game, Rise of the Phoenix is an excellent strategic war simulation.\\" They praised the numerous options, the music, and the cinematic sequences, and scored it a 6.8 out of 10. GamePro contended that the game's simplified interface compared to other Koei games (specifically, the lack of emphasis on city management and cash flow, and the inability to control individual fighting units), while making the game slightly more accessible to casual gamers, would be highly unsatisfying to Koei's fan base.

The trains use UTDC's proprietary linear motor-based Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS, now branded as Bombardier Innovia Metro) and are its Mark I model, which is also used by the Vancouver SkyTrain and the Detroit People Mover. They consist of 14 married pair sets (28 cars total) with fleet numbers 3000 to 3027, and are not compatible with the trains on other Toronto lines, which use conventional motors. Test runs took place in 1984 and full service began in 1985. When the line opened, 12 sets operated individually as two-car units. In 1986, two more sets were added, allowing sets to be coupled to form four-car units as ridership grew. All trains operate automatically without human intervention.

Stanley Dollar Sr. Residence In 1960, R. Stanley Dollar, Jr. (the son of the shipping magnate) sold the family estate to Ross W. Cortese. Cortese owned a development company called Rossmoor Corporation. He had been active in Orange County and the unincorporated community there named Rossmoor was one of his projects. After finishing Rossmoor he started on a new idea of private gated retirement communities for active seniors called Leisure World, starting with the Seal Beach Leisure World in Seal Beach in 1960. Leisure World promised low-cost housing, coupled with services appropriate to Cortese's view of retirement; golf courses, swimming pools, clubhouses, riding stables, transportation, medical services and a host of administrative employees so that the residents did not have to bother themselves with house and yard maintenance, even little things like waste collection, cable television service and watering the lawn. Cortese's plans were too ambitious and he lost control of Rossmoor in Walnut Creek almost immediately after ground was first broken. The name \\"Leisure World\\" is still used as a trademark by Cortese's family, but it has not been applied to Rossmoor in Walnut Creek for many years. Cortese's idea was popular, and others carried out his scheme. Community description Congressman Mark DeSaulnier visiting with residents of Rossmoor in 2020. Rossmoor Walnut Creek is a nationally recognized senior adult community located in the Tice Valley area of Walnut Creek, California. Surrounded by acres of open space, this community is two miles (3 km) from downtown Walnut Creek, and from downtown San Francisco. Development of the community began in 1963 and, today, there are approximately 6,700 residential units in three cooperatives, 12 condominium and one single-family home developments (referred to as Homeowner Associations or HOAs). Forty percent of the homes are garden-style duplexes to four-plexes, and the remaining are either mid-to-high-rise, and one area of 63 individual single-family homes. Homes vary in price from mid $200,000s for some cooperatives to over $1 million for the single-family homes and garden style condominiums. At least one resident must be 55 years of age or older to live in a home in Rossmoor. Amenities include two NCGA-rated golf courses (one nine-hole and one 18-hole), a large indoor pool and fitness complex, two outdoor pools, six tennis courts, lawn bowling greens, bocce courts, hiking trails and table tennis facilities. Management Rossmoor is managed by the Golden Rain Foundation, which is a nonprofit corporation. It has nine directors, each elected from separate districts in Rossmoor. Each director serves a three-year term, with no director serving for more than two terms.Golden Rain Foundation (2011). \\"Golden Rain Foundation of Walnut Creek Bylaws\\", Article IV, Section 2(c) References External links * Rossmoor official site * The Rossmoor weekly newspaper site Neighborhoods in Walnut Creek, California Gated communities in California ","title":"Rossmoor, Walnut Creek, California"},{"id":"2964903","text":"Geheimrat Julius Wilhelm Theodor Curtius (27 May 1857 - 8 February 1928) was professor of Chemistry at Heidelberg University and elsewhere. He published the Curtius rearrangement in 1890/1894 and also discovered diazoacetic acid, hydrazine and hydrazoic acid. History Grave in Heidelberg Theodor Curtius was born in Duisburg in the Ruhr area in Germany. He studied chemistry with Robert Bunsen at Heidelberg University and with Hermann Kolbe at Leipzig University. He received his doctorate in 1882 in Leipzig. After working from 1884 to 1886 for Adolf von Baeyer at the University of Munich, Curtius became the director of the analytical chemistry department at University of Erlangen until 1889. Then he accepted the chair in Chemistry at the University of Kiel, where he remained very productive. In line with this success, Curtius was appointed Geheimer Regierungsrat (Privy Councillor) in 1895. After a one-year appointment as the successor of the famous August Kekul√© at Bonn University in 1897, Curtius succeeded Victor Meyer as Professor of Chemistry at his old university in Heidelberg in 1898, where he remained until his retirement in 1926. He was succeeded by Karl Freudenberg, who wrote Curtius' biography in 1962. In his free time, he also composed music, sang in concerts, and was an active mountaineer. In 1894 he founded the Kiel section of the Association of German and Austrian Alpinists, which he personally supported with gifts. In his Munich period, he became a close friend of the alpinist guide Christian Klucker, with whom he made mountaineering hikes for many years thereafter. Theodor Curtius died in Heidelberg on 8 February 1928. The Heidelberg University Archives has, in its possession, a photo album from 1907 marking the 25th anniversary of Theodor Curtius receiving his Doctorate. It shows pictures of science scholars, buildings, and labs such as the physio-chemical, pharmaceutical, and organics labs, and much more.

He is the half-brother of Parzival, the story's hero. He is the child of their father Gahmuret's first marriage to the Moorish queen Belacane, and equals his brother in knightly ability. Because his father was white and his mother black, Feirefiz's skin consists of black and white patches. His appearance is compared to that of a magpie or a parchment with writing on it, though he is considered very handsome. While serving the \\"Baruch\\" of \\"Baldac\\" (Baghdad), Gahmuret defends Belacane, queen of the heathen nation of Zazamanc, from her enemies. The two marry, and she soon becomes pregnant with Feirefiz. Belacane won't allow her husband to participate in tournaments, so he leaves one night and travels to Spain to seek knightly combat in secret. Before he can go back, he learns that his brother, the king of Anjou, has died, leaving him to inherit the kingdom. Returning to Europe, he marries Herzeloyde of Waleis (probably Wales), and she bears him Parzival. He dies soon after as a result of dark magic used against him in a joust outside of Baghdad, and is acknowledged as the finest knight of his time. Later, Feirefiz travels to Europe with a huge Saracen army to seek his father. He meets Parzival and the two fight. Though Feirefiz proves himself to be Parzival's only equal, Parzival thinks of his wife Condwiramurs, which inspires him to break his sword across Feirefiz' helmet. Feirefiz would not fight an unarmed man, so he puts an end to the duel, asserting that Parzival would have won the battle had his sword held out for one more blow. They identify themselves, and after realising they are brothers, they embrace and go off to a feast with King Arthur and his court. While there, the Grail servant Cundrie arrives to take Parzival to the Grail Castle of Munsalvaesche, and Parzival invites Feirefiz to join him. Parzival heals the Fisher King Anfortas and becomes the new Grail King. It is revealed that Feirefiz cannot see the Holy Grail because he is not a Christian. He agrees to be baptised if it will help him in love, and as soon as he renounces his heathen god Jupiter, he can see the Grail. He marries the Grail bearer Repanse de Schoye, and after celebrating Parzival's coronation, Feirefiz and his new wife return to his lands in the east. Repanse gives birth to Prester John, and they preach Christianity through their kingdom. Feirefiz represents Wolfram's belief that the Saracens were not wicked or even responsible for their lack of belief in Christ, an attitude that was not common in medieval Europe. Wolfram's cosmology included the non-believers as brothers who had not yet been reached by the word of Christianity.  Greater meaning in Parzival During the confrontation between Feirefiz and Parzival, Feirefiz states \\"You [Parzival] have quarreled with the same one here and I have struggled with it\\". According to C. B. Caples, many seem to think that this shows that Feirefiz was meant to be a metaphor of Parzival's young and unruly side of himself that was inclined to sin. Wapnewski also supports this claim, interpreting Feirefiz to be a \\"ghost\\" of a younger and immature Parzival, which can be seen through Feirefiz's varicolored skin that is supposed to represent sin. According to Peter Wapnewski, the struggle between Parzival and Ferirefiz is representative of the struggle between the mature and immature sides of Parzival, or the \\"part of Parzival's character he had to overcome before he could be worthy of the Grail.\\" However, Caples argues against this, pointing out that Feirefiz could find his way to the Grail, which would have to mean that he was baptised and cleansed of sin, thus meaning that he had become \\"better\\". As well, Caples counters Wapnewski's claim by pointing out that Feirefiz's skin does not change colour after baptism, which must mean that his skin is a permanent colour and has no relation with his state of sin. Wolfgang Harms also agrees with this point, citing similar reasons, chief among them being Feirefiz's ability to marry the Grail King's daughter. Caples also argues that it is impossible for Feirefiz to represent Parzival's young and immature side, as Wapnewski believes, because Feirefiz is older and also more experienced in the ways of the world. As well, Feirefiz conducts himself with honour and humility after he and Parzival end their duel. This duel, which was written as a draw, was seen to Feirefiz as Parzival's victory. Feirefiz unmasks himself and casts his blade aside, leaving himself completely at the mercy of Parzival. Feirefiz also asks if he may refer to Parzival as \\"du\\", a sign of respect and endearment. This, according to Caples, serves to show that Feirefiz is more mature than Wapnewski believes. References *Wolfram von Eschenbach; Hatto, A. T. (1980). Parzival.

After the war Ruckteschell was convicted of war crimes and died in prison. Naval career Born in 1890 in Hamburg, Ruckteschell joined the German navy in 1908. In 1916, with the rank of Oberleutnant zur See, he transferred to the U-boat arm. He served as Watch Officer on and , before being given his own command in July 1917, first of , then in March 1918, of . He earned a reputation as an overly aggressive commander, which caused him to be placed on a black-list of officers the Allied powers considered to have breached the laws of war. After the end of World War I, he left Germany returning in the early 1930s. Ruckteschell was recalled to duty in the Kriegsmarine in 1939 and given command of an auxiliary minelayer. He next took command of the and sailed her into the Atlantic Ocean on 6 May 1940, commencing a five-month cruise that would sink or capture ten enemy merchant ships. When he brought Widder into port at Brest, he refused the Naval Command's order to take the ship to Hamburg, because the passage through British controlled was too risky. Instead, he assumed command of the commerce raider for her first cruise (9 March 1942 to 1 March 1943), during which he captured or sank fifteen ships. Von Ruckteschell was relieved when he arrived in Japan at his own request for health reasons. Ruckteschell was one of the more successful raider captains. The success of a commerce raider is measure by both the tonnage destroyed and the time spent at large. Ruckteschell accounted for (second only to Ernst-Felix Kr√ºder of Pinguin) and stayed at large for 538 days, (second only to Bernhard Rogge of Atlantis ); however, Ruckteschell accomplished this over two voyages. Of the 13 voyages by 10 raiders, Michel and Widder claimed 15 ships of , and 10 ships of (4th and 6th highest), and stayed at large for 358, and 180 days ( 4th and 9th longest). War crimes trial Ruckteschell was the subject of one of the first war crimes investigations undertaken by the British Admiralty. It was alleged that on several occasions Ruckteschell had continued firing on merchant vessels after they had surrendered. This contravened the laws of naval warfare, the Admiralty requested that Ruckteschell and his crew members be detained for interrogation. Ruckteschell spent the last years of the war on the staff of the German naval attach√© in Japan. He was eventually located in an internment camp near Kobe and was sent back to Germany for trial. The British charges submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission claimed \\"at least one clear case of mass murder and several equally clear cases of the sinking of vessels whose crew were on the vessels when they were fired on, and were not picked up subsequently when on boats, rafts and in the water.\\" =Charges= *1. Regarding , which was attacked on 10 July 1940 by Widder. :The charge was that he continued to fire after the radio was knocked out and the signal to surrender acknowledged. It was charged that the Widders gunners continued to fire for eight minutes after a signal was sent indicating that the Davisian crew was abandoning ship. :The defence maintained that no signal had been seen or received and that three seamen on board the Davisian were seen heading towards her ship's gun. *2.

Regarding , attacked on 11 September 1942 by Michel. :The charge was that he continued to fire after she had surrendered. :The defence maintained that the surrender signal was not seen. Also, that there was confusion on the bridge of Michel whether the ship was using a radio. =Trial= The trial was held in Hamburg between 5 and 21 May 1946. Ruckteschell chose as his defence counsel Dr. Otto Zippel, who had earlier represented Karl-Heinz Moehle. Zippel tried to define the limitations of international law, called Vizeadmiral Bernhard Rogge as an expert witness, and questioned the testimony of the British sailors. In closing, he asserted that \\"the law has recognized that in matters of sea even clever people are more liable to commit an error than in other walks of life\\". The British military court convicted Ruckteschell on three of the four charges - Charges 1, 2, and 3 were upheld, while Charge 4 was rejected - and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. Three years were later remitted from his sentence on 30 August 1947, when he was acquitted of one more of the charges. The trial raised serious concerns about further war crimes trials involving naval affairs, since only one junior naval officer had sat as a judge during the trial, and army officers could not be expected to have a good knowledge of naval warfare. Zippel stated during the appeal that \\"a court composed of experienced sea officers would have arrived at a different judgment in the case\\". Royal Navy officers acknowledged that there was a real chance of a miscarriage of justice and the naval authorities actually discouraged further naval-related war crimes trials because of the difficulty of finding suitable naval officers to take part in them. Ruckteschell's trial was the last held under the Royal Warrant on behalf of the Royal Navy. Ruckteschell died in the Hamburg-Fuhlsb√ºttel prison on 24 June 1948, shortly after he had been informed that he was going to be released due to his deteriorating heart condition.

It is located north of Golspie, and approximately south of Brora, overlooking the Dornoch Firth. Dunrobin's origins lie in the Middle Ages, but most of the present building and the gardens were added by Sir Charles Barry between 1835 and 1850. Some of the original building is visible in the interior courtyard, despite a number of expansions and alterations that made it the largest house in the north of Scotland. After being used as a boarding school for seven years, it is now open to the public. History Dunrobin Castle as it appeared in about 1813, before later improvements The lands of Sutherland were acquired before 1211, by Hugh, Lord of Duffus, grandson of the Flemish nobleman Freskin. The Earldom of Sutherland was created around 1235 for Hugh's son, William, surmised to have descended from the House of Moray by the female line. The castle may have been built on the site of an early medieval fort, but the oldest surviving portion, with an iron yett, is first mentioned in 1401. The earliest castle was a square keep with walls over thick. Unusually, the ceilings of each floor were formed by stone vaults rather than being timber. The castle is thought to be named after Robert, the 6th Earl of Sutherland (d.1427). Dunrobin Castle was built in the midst of a tribal society, with Norse and Gaelic in use at the time. Robert the Bruce planted the Gordons, who supported his claim to the crown, at Huntly in Aberdeenshire, and they were created Earls of Huntly in 1445. The Earldom passed to the Gordon family in the 16th century when the 8th Earl of Sutherland gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Adam Gordon. After the 8th Earl died in 1508, Elizabeth's elder brother was declared heir to the title, but a (writ) of idiocy brought against him and his younger brother by the Gordons meant that the possession of the estate went to Adam Gordon in 1512. In 1518, in the absence of Adam Gordon, the castle was captured by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended with the addition of a large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west. During the Jacobite Rising of 1745, the Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart stormed Dunrobin Castle without warning, because the Clan Sutherland supported the British government. The 17th Earl of Sutherland, who had changed his surname from Gordon to Sutherland, narrowly escaped them, exiting through a back door. He sailed for Aberdeen where he joined the Duke of Cumberland's army. On the death of the 18th Earl in 1766, the house passed to his daughter, Elizabeth, who married the politician George Leveson-Gower, later created 1st Duke of Sutherland. In 1785, the house was altered and extended again. The west entrance of Dunrobin Castle, with the portion added by Charles Barry in the foreground. Between 1835 and 1850, Sir Charles Barry remodelled the castle in the Scottish Baronial style for the 2nd Duke of Sutherland. Barry had been the architect for the Palace of Westminster, home to the House of Commons, and was much in demand. He styled it his recently completed Italianate Garden at Trentham. The 14th-century tower, and the 17th-century and 18th-century extensions, were retained, and survive within Barry's 19th-century work. Dunrobin Castle railway station, on the Far North Line, was opened in 1870, as a private station for the castle. The present waiting room was constructed in 1902, and is a category B listed building. In 1915, the building was in use as a naval hospital when fire damaged the roof and much of the interior, but was confined to the newer additions by Barry. Scottish architect Sir Robert Lorimer was engaged to renovate the house following the First World War. From the 1920s the increasing cost of employment led to jobs such as the pollarding of trees being neglected, . When 5th Duke died in 1963, the Earldom and the house went to his niece, the recent Countess of Sutherland, while the Dukedom had to pass to a male heir and went to John Egerton, Earl of Ellesmere. Between 1965 and 1972, the house became a boarding school for boys, taking on forty boys and five teachers in its first year. Since 1973, the house and grounds have been open to the public, with private accommodation retained for the use of the Sutherland family. Architecture An older part integrated into newer additions. There are 189 rooms within the castle, making it the largest in the northern Highlands. Much of Barry's interior was destroyed by the fire of 1915, leading to the restoration by Sir Robert Lorimer, although he incorporated surviving 17th-century and 18th-century work, including wood carvings attributed to Grinling Gibbons. Externally, the castle has elements inspired by the work of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc, such as the pyramidal roof over the main entrance. The portion built by Barry uses freestone in broadly the same style as the turreted parts from the 16th and 17th centuries, but borrows significant elements from the ch√¢teau style. A large quadrangular pile of four stories, with towers at each corner, connects to the older castle by a building of three stories and containing the stately apartments. The tallest tower, containing the entrance, is high, the round towers being high and the clock tower . St. John's Well, in the courtyard of the oldest portion of the castle, is one of the deepest draw wells in Scotland, at . There is no indication as to the origin of the name. =Interior= In the entrance hall is a frieze of the armorials used by past earls of Sutherland. The main stairway, decorated with portraits of the Leveson-Gower family, is around wide and high. The panelled dining room, long and wide, has a wall-top Italian Grisaille frieze and a Khorassan carpet, as well as chairs containing the needlework of the 5th Duke's wife. The drawing room, made from two previous rooms by Lorimer during his restoration of the castle, looks out over the gardens and sea, and contains large Canalettos and 18th-century tapestries, as well as portraits by Hoppner and Reynolds. Housing over 10,000 books, the library features a painting by Philip de L√°szl√≥ of Duchess Eileen, as well as a mahogany Chippendale table. =Gardens= The gardens as viewed from the castle. The French influence extends into the gardens, completed in 1850, with Barry taking inspiration from the French formal style of the Gardens of Versailles. Each parterre is set around a circular pool with a fountain, with the essential layout the same since it was created in around 1848. Barry designed the parterre as an optical illusion, seen from above they appear to stretch beyond their physical layout, by narrowing it gradually. The total landscaped area is . =Museum= A museum displays the trophy heads of animals shot by family members on safari, ethnographic items from around the world and an important collection of archaeological artifacts. The museum retains its Victorian-Edwardian arrangement, and is housed in an 18th-century summer-house adjoining the formal gardens. Historically, the castle is a category A listed building, and the gardens are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. The castle is open to visitors between April and October each year. Falconry displays are held in the castle's gardens by a resident Falconer.

Induction furnace capacities range from less than one kilogram to one hundred tonnes, and are used to melt iron and steel, copper, aluminum, and precious metals. The advantage of the induction furnace is a clean, energy-efficient and well-controllable melting process compared to most other means of metal melting. Most modern foundries use this type of furnace, and now also more iron foundries are replacing cupolas with induction furnaces to melt cast iron, as the former emit much dust and other pollutants. Since no arc or combustion is used, the temperature of the material is no higher than required to melt it; this can prevent loss of valuable alloying elements.Phillip F. Ostwald, Jairo Mu√±oz, Manufacturing Processes and Systems (9th Edition), John Wiley & Sons, 1997 page 48 The one major drawback to induction furnace usage in a foundry is the lack of refining capacity; charge materials must be clean of oxidation products and of a known composition and some alloying elements may be lost due to oxidation (and must be re-added to the melt). Types In the coreless type, metal is placed in a crucible surrounded by a water-cooled alternating current solenoid coil. A channel-type induction furnace has a loop of molten metal, which forms a single-turn secondary winding through an iron core. \\"Chapter IV: Channel Type or 'Low Frequency' Induction Furnaces\\", pp. 153‚Äì252 Operation thumb1 - Melt 2 - water-cooled coil 3 - yokes 4 - crucible An induction furnace consists of a nonconductive crucible holding the charge of metal to be melted, surrounded by a coil of copper wire. A powerful alternating current flows through the wire. The coil creates a rapidly reversing magnetic field that penetrates the metal. The magnetic field induces eddy currents, circular electric currents, inside the metal, by electromagnetic induction. The eddy currents, flowing through the electrical resistance of the bulk metal, heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic materials like iron, the material may also be heated by magnetic hysteresis, the reversal of the molecular magnetic dipoles in the metal. Once melted, the eddy currents cause vigorous stirring of the melt, assuring good mixing. An advantage of induction heating is that the heat is generated within the furnace's charge itself rather than applied by a burning fuel or other external heat source, which can be important in applications where contamination is an issue. Operating frequencies range from utility frequency (50 or 60 Hz) to 400 kHz or higher, usually depending on the material being melted, the capacity (volume) of the furnace and the melting speed required. Generally, the smaller the volume of the melts, the higher the frequency of the furnace used; this is due to the skin depth which is a measure of the distance an alternating current can penetrate beneath the surface of a conductor. For the same conductivity, the higher frequencies have a shallow skin depth‚Äîthat is less penetration into the melt. Lower frequencies can generate stirring or turbulence in the metal. A preheated, one-tonne furnace melting iron can melt cold charge to tapping readiness within an hour. Power supplies range from 10 kW to 42 MW, with melt sizes of 20 kg to 65 tonnes of metal respectively. An operating induction furnace usually emits a hum or whine (due to fluctuating magnetic forces and magnetostriction), the pitch of which can be used by operators to identify whether the furnace is operating correctly or at what power level.

Biography =Early life and education= Katharine Marjory Ramsay was born in Edinburgh on 6 November 1874, the daughter of Sir James Henry Ramsay, 10th Baronet. She was educated at Wimbledon High School and the Royal College of Music. During her school years she was known as Kitty Ramsay. On 20 July 1899, she married John Stewart-Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine, who succeeded his father as 8th Duke of Atholl in 1917, whereupon she became formally styled Duchess of Atholl. =Political career= Known as \\"Kitty\\", Stewart-Murray was active in Scottish social service and local government and in 1912 served on the hugely influential \\"Highlands and Islands Medical Service Committee\\" (authors of the Dewar Report) that has been widely credited with creating the forerunner of the National Health Service. She was the chairman of the Consultative Council on Highlands and Islands As the Marchioness of Tullibardine she was an opponent of female suffrage, with Leah Leneman describing her as 'a key speaker at the most important Scottish anti-suffrage demonstration', which took place in 1912. In 1913 she became vice-president of the branch of the Anti-Suffrage League based in Dundee. Despite this opposition to women gaining the right to vote in parliamentary elections, she went on to be the Scottish Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Kinross and West Perthshire from 1923‚Äì38, and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education from 1924‚Äì29, the first woman other than a Mistress of the Robes to serve in a British Conservative government. She was the first woman elected to represent a Scottish seat at Westminster. The historian William Knox has argued that, like other early female MPs in the UK, \\"she literally inherited\\" her seat from her husband, but Kenneth Baxter disputes this, noting that her husband had stood down from the former West Perthshire seat in 1917 when he succeeded to the dukedom and that it had been won by a Liberal candidate in 1918 and 1922. Moreover, Baxter claims her victory in 1923 was not seen as \\"a foregone conclusion\\". The fact that, prior to 1918, Atholl had been opposed to women's suffrage led to her being criticised in parliament by her Conservative colleague Nancy Astor. She resigned the Conservative Whip first in 1935 over the India Bill and the \\"national-socialist tendency\\" of the government's domestic policy. Resuming the Whip, she resigned it again in 1938 in opposition to Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement of Adolf Hitler and to the Anglo-Italian agreement. According to her biography, A Working Partnership she was then deselected by her local party. She took Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds on 28 November 1938. She stood unsuccessfully in the subsequent by-election as an Independent candidate.Financial Times She argued that she actively opposed totalitarian regimes and practices. In 1931, she published The Conscription of a People‚Äîa protest against the abuse of rights in the Soviet Union. In 1936, she was involved in a long-running battle in the pages of various newspapers with Lady Houston after the latter had become notorious for her outspoken support of Benito Mussolini. Stewart-Murray had taken issue with Houston calling in the pages of the Saturday Review on the king to become British dictator in imitation of the European fascist regimes. According to her autobiography Working Partnership (1958), it was at the prompting of Ellen Wilkinson that in April 1937 she, Eleanor Rathbone, and Wilkinson went to Spain to observe the effects of the Spanish Civil War. In Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid she saw the impact of Luftwaffe bombing on behalf of the Nationalists, visited prisoners of war held by the Republicans and considered the impact of the conflict on women and children, in particular. Her book Searchlight on Spain resulted from the involvement, and her support for the Republican side in the conflict led to her being nicknamed by some the Red Duchess. Shortly before or even during 1938, she travelled to Romania where she visited \\"Satu Mare Romanian Women Association\\" in the city of Satu Mare aiming to support the Romanian cause to preserve the state borders established in 1918 and keep Hungary from regaining the territory that it lost then.Maria A. Demian, Asocia≈£ia Rom√¢ncelor SƒÉtmƒÉrene, in AFIRMAREA, editatƒÉ de despƒÉr≈£ƒÉm√¢ntul ASTRA din Satu Mare an III, nr.1-2, Jan‚ÄìFeb 1938, p. 10 (BCU Cluj-Napoca). She campaigned against the Soviet control of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary as the chairman of the League for European Freedom in Britain from 1945. In 1958, she published a biography of her life with her husband entitled Working Partnership. Other She was also a vice-president of the Girls' Public Day School Trust from 1924‚Äì1960. She was also a keen composer, setting music to accompany the poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson. She was closely involved in her husband's regiment The Scottish Horse and composed the melody \\"The Scottish Horse\\" to be played on bagpipes. Honours She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1918 Birthday Honours. As Dowager Duchess of Atholl she took over the appointment of Honorary Colonel of The Regiment of Scottish Horse from 1942, until she relinquished it in 1952.

Young then headed overseas to Singapore where he had three successful seasons. He joined S League side Woodlands Wellington from 1996 to 1997. In his last season in Singapore, he finished as the league's top goal scorer with Home United FC. In 1999, he rejoined Woodlands Wellington before joining Australian team Wollongong Wolves in the old NSL the same year. The move proved to be a successful one for the striker and he enjoyed five special years in NSW, captaining the side from 2002‚Äì04 and winning two NSL Championships along the way. He is the Wollongong Wolves' highest ever goal scorer with 60 goals. His move to the Perth Glory for the inaugural A-league season endured some early hiccups due to the club's then manager Steve McMahon's reluctance to play the veteran striker. It was suggested that McMahon's apathy towards him resulted from the fact that Young was not one of his signings. During the couple of occasions in which he was used by McMahon, he was substituted on late during the game and this was also indicative of McMahon's belief that his usefulness to the team was limited.

There are two main categories of generals: the general officers (officiers g√©n√©raux), which are the highest-ranking commanding officers in the armed forces, and the specialist officers with flag rank (officiers des services avec rang d'officer g√©n√©ral), which are high-level officers in the other uniformed services.  General officers =Army=  Ranks as of 2013 In France, army generals are named after the type of unit they command. In ascending order there are two ranks : * 50 px G√©n√©ral de brigade (\\"brigade general\\"). * 50 px G√©n√©ral de division (\\"divisional general\\"). Officers holding the rank of g√©n√©ral de division can receive different positions and styles (rang et appellation) : * 50 px G√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e (\\"corps general\\"). * 50 px G√©n√©ral d'arm√©e (\\"army general\\"). The appointment of mar√©chal de France, wearing seven stars, is purely honorary. * 50 px Mar√©chal de France (\\"Marshal of France\\"). History The French army of the monarchy had several ranks of general officer: * Brigadier des arm√©es du roi (\\"brigadier of the armies of the King\\"): a rank in a grey area of seniority, conferred on certain colonels who were in command of a brigade (cf. the grey area of the naval \\"commodore\\" rank given to certain captains, the equivalent of army full colonels, who had been in command of a group of ships and over the captains of the group's other ships). These officers wore a colonel's uniform with a star on the shoulder straps. This rank was abolished in 1788. * Mar√©chal de camp (\\"field marshal\\"(major general)): the first substantive rank of general. The mar√©chaux de camp wore a special uniform, blue and red, with a single bar of gold lace, and in the late 18th century also received two stars on the shoulder straps. With the abolition of the rank of brigadier des arm√©es in 1788, it became the lowest general officer rank, but its insignia of two stars remained unchanged. The rank was redesignated G√©n√©ral de brigade in 1793 which retained the two star insignia. This explains why French generals' insignia starts with two stars. * Lieutenant g√©n√©ral: the highest military rank. Lieutenants g√©n√©raux wore the same uniform as the mar√©chaux de camp, but with two bars of gold lace, and in the late 18th century also received three stars on the shoulder straps. * G√©n√©ral: an appointment conferred on a lieutenant g√©n√©ral who was commander-in-chief of a campaign. * Mar√©chal de France: not a military rank, but a dignity of the Crown. During the French Revolution, the ranks of mar√©chal de camp and lieutenant general were renamed g√©n√©ral de brigade and g√©n√©ral de division, and the appointment of g√©n√©ral was renamed g√©n√©ral en chef. In 1793, the dignity of mar√©chal de France was abolished. Napol√©on Bonaparte reinstated the dignity of mar√©chal de France, now named mar√©chal d'empire. In 1814, the ranks of g√©n√©ral de brigade and g√©n√©ral de division reverted to mar√©chal de camp and lieutenant g√©n√©ral, but were changed back again in 1848. The Third Republic of the 1880s reorganised the ranks of g√©n√©ral: * G√©n√©ral de brigade, wearing two stars. * G√©n√©ral de division, wearing three stars. * G√©n√©ral commandant de corps d'arm√©e (g√©n√©ral commander of an army corps), an appointment conferred on certain g√©n√©raux de division, wearing four stars. This appointment became the position and style (rang et appellation) of g√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e in 1936. * G√©n√©ral membre du conseil sup√©rieur de la guerre (general - member of the superior council of war, a body of the Ministry of War which had the functions of a general staff), wearing five stars. The experience of the First World War transformed the structure of the French Army. The superior council of war was abolished and an appointment of g√©n√©ral commandant d'arm√©e (general commander of an army) was created. This appointment became the position and style (rang et appellation) of g√©n√©ral d'arm√©e in 1936. The dignity of mar√©chal de France was reinstated and given to the commanders-in-chief of the conflict, such as Joseph Joffre, Ferdinand Foch and Philippe P√©tain. = Navy = In ascending order there are two ranks : * 50 px Contre-amiral (Rear-Admiral). * 50 px Vice-amiral (Vice Admiral).

Erindale is named in honour of the birthplace of the first rector of the village, Reverend James Magrath from Erin (Ireland). It runs along Dundas Street West. The centre of the old village is just to the east of the Credit River valley. A large campus of the University of Toronto, known as University of Toronto Mississauga, is located on the west bank of the river. Rivi√®re du Credit During the 17th and 18th centuries, French trappers named the river on which Erindale sits as \\"Rivi√®re du Credit\\". Aboriginal peoples called it the \\"trusting river\\" because the guns, knives and kettles they obtained in exchange for their furs and woven baskets were often bought on credit. As settlement progressed, the Mississauga Indians sold their land. In the treaty of 1805 signed by Chief Quenippenon the tribe ceded . A second sale of 648,000 acres (2,620 km¬≤) followed in 1818. Settlers Dundas Street in Erindale (circa 1910) The \\"Indian Trail\\" became a military road and was named Dundas Street after the British Secretary-at-War, Henry Dundas. The Credit Village developed along Dundas Street, settled mainly by people from the bustling Town of York (now Toronto.) By 1809 there were 185 settlers in the area. Sawmills and grist mills were built, powered by water diverted from the river. Most of these settlers were United Empire Loyalists from the former Thirteen Colonies to the south or from settlements in Atlantic Canada, especially New Brunswick. By 1830 the Crown was selling the land in 100- to 200-acre (0.40‚Äì0.81 km2) lots and streets were named after prominent people who settled there. Old Country immigrants began arriving, mingling with the United Empire Loyalists and New Brunswickers. There was also a large group of Irish immigrants who arrived from New York City. Name The Credit Village became Springbrook, then Springfield and finally Erindale. Plank roads were laid over the mud of spring and fall and Erindale became a main stopping place for stagecoaches travelling between Toronto and Hamilton.

It opened in 1849 as one of the first public museums in the United Kingdom.\\"New Walk Museum Vision\\", University of Leicester. New Walk contains displays of science, history and art, both international and local. The original building was designed by Joseph Hansom, designer of the hansom cab.. It has been expanded several times, most recently in 2011. Major exhibits Permanent exhibits include dinosaurs, an Egyptian area, minerals of Leicestershire, the first Charnia fossil identified nearby, and a wildspace area featuring stuffed animals from around the world. =Dinosaurs and fossils= The \\"Barrow Kipper\\", a plesiosaur skeleton excavated at Barrow upon Soar New Walk Museum has a significant collection of extinct lifeforms. Two Mesozoic reptile skeletons are permanently on display ‚Äî a cetiosaur found in Rutland, and a plesiosaur from Barrow upon Soar.Official website The Rutland Dinosaur, affectionately nicknamed George, is a specimen of Cetiosaurus oxoniensis. The dinosaur, which is among the most complete sauropod skeletons in the world, was discovered in June 1968, in the Williamson Cliffe quarry near Little Casterton in Rutland. The skeletal remains have been in the museum since 1975; the majority of the bones in the display are replicas of the originals, which are too fragile to be used.Leicester City Council The Rutland Dinosaur featured on an episode of Blue Peter, and was opened by Blue Peter's Janet Ellis in 1985. The Barrow Kipper, named after the flattened fish, is a skeleton of an unidentified plesiosaur discovered in Barrow upon Soar in 1851. Originally classified as Plesiosaurus macrocephalus, it was later reclassified as Rhomaleosaurus megacephalus. However, according to Adam Smith and Gareth Dyke (2008), the fossil is actually of another, unnamed genus. In September 2011, the museum expanded its Dinosaur Gallery, reorganizing fossils, adding a new room, and modifying the gallery itself. The new Dinosaur Gallery, which predominantly features extinct marine reptiles, was opened by David Attenborough. The \\"star attractions\\" of the new gallery include the aforementioned Rutland cetiosaur, Charnia and plesiosaur fossils, as well as a Leedsichthys fossil and a piece of the Barwell Meteorite. The museum holds a specimen of international importance, the Charnia fossil.Leicester City Council It is the first fossil that was ever described that came from undoubted Precambrian rocks, which until this point had been thought to be too early for large forms of life. The object in the museum ‚Äì \\"Leicester's fossil celebrity\\" ‚Äì is a holotype, that is, the actual physical example from which the species was first identified and formally described. Charnia masoni was named after Roger Mason, who discovered it at Charnwood Forest in 1957, when he was a schoolboy, and who went on to a career as an academic geologist. He acknowledges, and the museum's Charnia display explains, that the fossil had been discovered a year earlier by a schoolgirl, Tina Negus, \\"but no one took her seriously\\".\\"In April 1957, I went rock- climbing in Charnwood Forest with two friends, Richard Allen and Richard Blachford (‚ÄòBlach‚Äô), fellow students at Wyggeston Grammar School, Leicester. I was already interested in geology and knew that the rocks of the Charnian Supergroup were Precambrian although I had not heard of the Australian fossils. Richard Allen and I agree that Blach (who died in the early 1960s) drew my attention to the leaf-like fossil holotype now on display in Leicester City Museum. I took a rubbing and showed it to my father, who was Minister of the Great Meeting Unitarian Chapel in East Bond Street, taught part-time at University College (soon to be Leicester University) and thus knew Trevor Ford. We took Trevor to visit the fossil site and convinced him that it was a genuine fossil. His publication of the discovery in the Journal of the Yorkshire Geological Society established the genus Charnia and aroused worldwide interest. ... I was able to report the discovery because of my father‚Äôs encouragement and the enquiring approach fostered by my science teachers. Tina Negus saw the frond before I did but no one took her seriously.\\" = Ancient Egypt = The museum has a permanent Egyptology exhibit. The museum holds four Egyptian mummies, named Pa-nesit-tawy, Pe-iuy, Bes-en-Mut and Ta-Bes.Leicester City Council The Egyptology section of the museum has undergone an expansion, covering life in Egypt in greater detail, as well as a section focused on death in Egypt, which is where the four mummies are held. The artefacts came mainly from Europeans visiting Egypt during the revival of interest in Egyptology which occurred during the 19th century. The capacity of the galleries have been greatly expanded as of 2018. The museum holds a collection of over 400 objects from the Ancient Egyptian era, but has only, until recently, been able to display around a third of these. The new gallery has allowed for these to be shown to the public. Other The museum has a stuffed polar bear, Peppy, the mascot of Fox's Glacier Mints. This is held in a collection of taxidermy animals, which have been collected from areas around the world. The exhibit includes a number of temperate specimens, as well as polar and savannah specimens. The museum holds the UK's largest collection of German Expressionist art. These paintings, including works by George Grosz, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, were smuggled out of Nazi Germany before World War II. The Nazis condemned the work of these painters ‚Äì see the 1937 Degenerate Art Exhibition. Hans Hess, son of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector, Alfred Hess, was assistant curator at the museum. In 2007, more than 100 pieces of Picasso ceramic art went on display at the museum, having been donated by Richard Attenborough.Lewis, Caroline. \\"Attenborough donates Picasso ceramics collection to Leicester New Walk Museum\\", Culture24, 7 June 2007.

Breeding programmes play a role in the conservation and preservation of the cheetah and the African wild dog Captive breeding, also known as \\"captive propagation\\", is the process of maintaining plants or animals in controlled environments, such as wildlife reserves, zoos, botanic gardens, and other conservation facilities. It is sometimes employed to help species that are being threatened by human activities such as habitat loss, fragmentation, over hunting or fishing, pollution, predation, disease, and parasitism. In some cases a captive breeding program can save a species from extinction, but for success, breeders must consider many factors‚Äîincluding genetic, ecological, behavioral, and ethical issues. Most successful attempts involve the cooperation and coordination of many institutions.  History  USFWS staff with two red wolf pups bred in captivity The Arabian Oryx is one of the first animals reintroduced via a captive breeding program. Captive breeding techniques began with the first human domestication of animals such as goats, and plants like wheat, at least 10,000 years ago. These practices were then expanded with the rise of the first zoos, which started as royal menageries in Egypt and its popularity, which led to the increase in zoos worldwide. The first actual captive breeding programs were only started in the 1960s. These programs, such as the Arabian Oryx breeding program from The Phoenix Zoo in 1962, were aimed at the reintroduction of these species into the wild. These programs expanded under The Endangered Species Act of 1973 of the Nixon Administration which focused on protecting endangered species and their habitats to preserve biodiversity. Since then, research and conservation. Have been housed in zoos, such as the Institute for Conservation Research at the San Diego Zoo founded in 1975 and expanded in 2009, which have contributed to the successful conservation efforts of species such as the Hawaiian Crow. Coordination The breeding of species of conservation concern is coordinated by cooperative breeding programs containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective. These studbooks contain information on birth date, gender, location, and lineage (if known), which helps determine survival and reproduction rates, number of founders of the population, and inbreeding coefficients. A species coordinator reviews the information in studbooks and determines a breeding strategy that would produce most advantageous offspring. If two compatible animals are found at different zoos, the animals may be transported for mating, but this is stressful, which could in turn make mating less likely. However, this is still a popular breeding method among European zoological organizations. Artificial fertilization (by shipping semen) is another option, but male animals can experience stress during semen collection, and the same goes for females during the artificial insemination procedure. Furthermore, this approach yields lower-quality semen, because shipping requires extending the life of the sperm for the transit time. There are regional programmes for the conservation of endangered species: *Americas: Species Survival Plan SSP (Association of Zoos and Aquariums AZA, Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums CAZA) *Europe: European Endangered Species Programme EEP (European Association of Zoos and Aquaria EAZA) *Australasia: Australasian Species Management Program ASMP (Zoo and Aquarium Association ZAA) *Africa: African Preservation Program APP (African Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquaria PAAZAB) *Japan: Conservation activities of Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums JAZA *South Asia: Conservation activities of South Asian Zoo Association for Regional Cooperation SAZARC *South East Asia: Conservation activities of South East Asian Zoos Association SEAZA  Challenges  =Genetics= The objective of many captive populations is to hold similar levels of genetic diversity to what is found in wild populations. As captive populations are usually small and maintained in artificial environments, genetics factors such as adaptation, inbreeding and loss of diversity can be a major concern.  Domestication (Adaptation)  Adaptive differences between plant and animal populations arise due to variations in environmental pressures. In the case of captive breeding prior to reintroduction into the wild, it's possible for species to evolve to adapt to the captive environment, rather than their natural environment.[11] Reintroducing a plant or animal to an environment dissimilar to the one they were originally from can cause fixation of traits that may not be suited for that environment leaving the individual disadvantaged. Selection intensity, initial genetic diversity, and effective population size can impact how much the species adapts to its captive environment. Modeling works indicate that the duration of the programs (i.e., time from the foundation of the captive population to the last release event) is an important determinant of reintroduction success. Success is maximized for intermediate project duration allowing the release of a sufficient number of individuals, while minimizing the number of generations undergoing relaxed selection in captivity. Can be minimized by reducing the number of generations in captivity, minimizing selection for captive adaptations by creating environment similar to natural environment and maximizing the number of immigrants from wild populations.  Genetic diversity  One consequence of small captive population size is the increased impact of genetic drift, where genes have the potential to fix or disappear completely by chance, thereby reducing genetic diversity. Other factors that can impact genetic diversity in a captive population are bottlenecks and initial population size. Bottlenecks, such as rapid decline in the population or a small initial population impacts genetic diversity. Loss can be minimized by establishing a population with a large enough number of founders to genetically represent the wild population, maximize population size, maximize ratio of effective population size to actual population size, and minimize the number of generations in captivity.  Inbreeding  Inbreeding is when organisms mate with closely related individuals, lowering heterozygosity in a population. Although inbreeding can be relatively common, when it results in a reduction in fitness it is known as inbreeding depression. The detrimental effects of inbreeding depression are especially prevalent in smaller populations and can therefore be extensive in captive populations. To make these populations the most viable, it is important to monitor and reduce the effects of deleterious allele expression caused by inbreeding depression and to restore genetic diversity. Comparing inbred populations against non-inbred or less-inbred populations can help determine the extent of detrimental effects if any are present. Closely monitoring the possibility of inbreeding within the captive bred population is also key to the success of reintroduction into the species' native habitat. The Speke's Gazelle was the focus of a captive breeding program centered on determining the effect of selection on reducing genetic load. = Outbreeding = Outbreeding is when organisms mate with unrelated individuals, increasing heterozygosity in a population. Although new diversity is often beneficial, if there a large genetic differences between the two individuals it can result in outbreeding depression. This is a reduction in fitness, similar to that of inbreeding depression, but arises from a number of different mechanisms, including taxonomic issues, chromosomal differences, sexual incompatibility, or adaptive differences between the individuals. A common cause is chromosomal ploidy differences and hybridization between individuals leading to sterility. The best example is in the orangutan, which, prior to taxonomic revisions in the 1980s would be commonly mated in captive populations producing hybrid orangutans with lower fitness . If chromosomal ploidy is ignored during reintroduction, restoration efforts would fail due to sterile hybrids in the wild. If there are large genetic differences between individuals originally from distant populations, those individuals should only be bred in circumstances where no other mates exist. Behavior changes Captive breeding can contribute to changes in behavior in animals that have been reintroduced to the wild. Released animals are commonly less capable of hunting or foraging for food, which leads to starvation, possibly because the young animals spent the critical learning period in captivity. Released animals often display more risk-taking behavior and fail to avoid predators. Golden lion tamarin mothers often die in the wild before having offspring because they cannot climb and forage. This leads to continuing population declines despite reintroduction as the species are unable to produce viable offspring. Training can improve anti-predator skills, but its effectiveness varies. Salmon bred in captivity have shown similar declines in caution and are killed by predators when young. However, salmon that were reared in an enriched environment with natural prey showed less risk-taking behaviors and were more likely to survive. A study on mice has found that after captive breeding had been in place for multiple generations and these mice were \\"released\\" to breed with wild mice, that the captive-born mice bred amongst themselves instead of with the wild mice. This suggests that captive breeding may affect mating preferences, and has implications for the success of a reintroduction program. Chatham Island Black Robin on Rangatira Island, New Zealand. Human mediated recovery of species can unintentionally promote maladaptive behaviors in wild populations. In 1980 the number of wild Chatham Island Black Robins was reduced to a single mating pair. Intense management of populations helped the population recover and by 1998 there were 200 individuals. During recovery scientists observed \\"rim laying\\" an egg laying habit where individuals laid eggs on the rim of the nest instead of the center. Rim laid eggs never hatched. To combat this land managers pushed the egg to the center of the nest, which greatly increased reproduction. However, by allowing this maladaptive trait to persist, over half the population were now rim layers. Genetic studies found that this was an autosomal dominant mendelian trait that was selected for due to human intervention Successes A cheetah at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre. King cheetah, a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation at De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre The De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre, established in South Africa in 1971, has a cheetah captive breeding program. Between 1975 and 2005, 242 litters were born with a total of 785 cubs. The survival rate of cubs was 71.3% for the first twelve months and 66.2% for older cubs, validating the fact that cheetahs can be bred successfully (and their endangerment decreased). It also indicated that failure in other breeding habitats may be due to \\"poor\\" sperm morphology. Przewalski‚Äôs horse, the only horse species never to have been domesticated, was recovered from the brink of extinction by a captive breeding program, and successfully reintroduced in the 1990s to the Mongolia, with more than 750 wild roaming Przewalski‚Äôs horses today. The Gal√°pagos tortoise population, once reaching as low in population as 12 remaining individuals, was recovered to more than 2000 today by a captive breeding program. A further 8 tortoise species were supported by captive breeding programs in the island chain. Wild Tasmanian devils have declined by 90% due to a transmissible cancer called Devil Facial Tumor Disease. A captive insurance population program has started, but the captive breeding rates at the moment are lower than they need to be. Keeley, Fanson, Masters, and McGreevy (2012) sought to \\"increase our understanding of the estrous cycle of the devil and elucidate potential causes of failed male-female pairings\\" by examining temporal patterns of fecal progestogen and corticosterone metabolite concentrations. They found that the majority of unsuccessful females were captive-born, suggesting that if the species' survival depended solely on captive breeding, the population would probably disappear. In 2010, the Oregon Zoo found that Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit pairings based on familiarity and preferences resulted in a significant increase in breeding success. In 2019, researchers trying to breed captive American paddlefish and Russian sturgeon separately inadvertently bred sturddlefish - a hybrid fish between the two fish.  Methods used  Every known individual of the California condor population has been captured and then bred using research from microsatellite regions in their genome. To found a captive breeding population with adequate genetic diversity, breeders usually select individuals from different source populations‚Äîideally, at least 20-30 individuals. Founding populations for captive breeding programs have often had fewer individuals than ideal because of their threatened state, leaving them more susceptible to challenges such as inbreeding depression. To overcome challenges of captive breeding such as adaptive differences, loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and outbreeding depression and get desired results, captive breeding programs use many monitoring methods. Artificial insemination is used to produce the desired offspring from individuals who don't mate naturally to reduce effects of mating closely related individuals such as inbreeding. Methods as seen in panda pornography allow programs to mate chosen individuals by encouraging mating behavior. As a concern in captive breeding is to minimize the effects of breeding closely related individuals, microsatellite regions from an organisms genome can be used to determine amounts of relationship among founders to minimize relatedness and pick the most distant individuals to breed. This method has successfully been used in the captive breeding of the California condor and the Guam rail. The maximum avoidance of inbreeding (MAI) scheme allows control at a group level rather than an individual level by rotating individuals between groups to avoid inbreeding. New technologies = Assisted reproduction technology (ART): Artificial insemination = Getting captive wild animals to breed naturally can be a difficult task. Giant pandas for example lose interest in mating once they are captured, and female giant pandas only experience estrus once a year, which only lasts for 48 to 72 hours. Many researchers have turned to artificial insemination in an attempt to increase the populations of endangered animals. It may be used for many reasons, including to overcome physical breeding difficulties, to allow a male to inseminate a much larger number of females, to control the paternity of offspring, and to avoid injury incurred during natural mating. It also creates more genetically diverse captive populations, enabling captive facilities to easily share genetic material with each other without the need to move animals. Scientist of the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen, Germany, from the working group of Michael Lierz, developed a novel technique for semen collection and artificial insemination in parrots producing the world's first macaw by assisted reproduction = Cryopreservation = Animal species can be preserved in gene banks, which consist of a cryogenic facilities used to store live sperm, eggs, or embryos in ultracold conditions. The Zoological Society of San Diego has established a \\"frozen zoo\\" to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species samples using cryopreservation techniques. At present, there has been more than 355 species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. Cryopreservation can be performed as oocyte cryopreservation before fertilization, or as embryo cryopreservation after fertilization. Cryogenically preserved specimens can potentially be used to revive breeds that are endangered or rextinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development. This method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time- period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation. However, cryo- conservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable. Cryo-conservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm, but cryobiology is a field of active research and many studies concerning plants are underway. An example of the use of cryoconservation to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the Hungarian Grey cattle, or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9 million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of World War II and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970. The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the mechanization of agriculture and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production. The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates. The government program included various conservation strategies, including the cryopreservation of semen and embryos. The Hungarian government's conservation effort brought the population up to 10,310 in 2012, which shows significant improvement using cryoconservation. = Cloning = The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent, when working with familiar species such as mice, while cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful. In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian gaur, an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a banteng was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last bucardo (Pyrenean ibex) were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah. However, cloning of animals is opposed by animal- groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die.https://theweek.com/articles/488945/are-cloned-animals-safe- eat = Interspecific pregnancy = A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy, implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term. It has been used for the Spanish Ibex and Houbara bustard.  Ethical considerations  With successes such as in 1986 when a population only of 18 black ferrets left in the world was brought back up to 500 in the wild, and when the Arabian oryx was brought back from extinction in 1972 to a population of 1,000 in the deserts of the Middle East, captive breeding programs have proven successful throughout history. While captive breeding sounds like an ideal solution for preventing endangered animals from facing serious threats of extinction there are still reasons to believe that these programs can occasionally do more harm than good. Some detrimental effects include delays in understanding optimal conditions required for reproduction, failure to reach self-sustaining levels or provide sufficient stock for release, loss of genetic diversity due to inbreeding, and poor success in reintroductions despite available captive-bred young. Although it has been proven that captive breeding programs have yielded negative genetic effects in decreasing the fitness of captive-bred organisms, there is no direct evidence to show that this negative effect also decreases the overall fitness of their wild-born descendants. There is reason to demand for the release of animals from captivity programs for four main reasons: a lack of sufficient space due to overly successful breeding programs, closure of facilities due to financial reasons, pressure from animal rights advocacy groups, and to aid the conservation of endangered species. Additionally, there are many ethical complications to reintroducing animals born in captivity back into the wild. For example, when scientists were reintroducing a rare species of toad back into the Mallorcan wild in 1993, a potentially deadly fungus that could kill frogs and toads was unintentionally introduced. It is also important to maintain the organism‚Äôs original habitat, or replicate that specific habitat for species survival.

It became a focal point of the United States invasion of Cuba in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Overview Spanish General Arsenio Linares y Pombo ordered the area from Daiquir√≠ to Siboney fortified in anticipation of U.S. disembarkments there. On June 20, 1898, U.S. Navy Admiral William T. Sampson, U.S. Army General William Rufus Shafter and Cuban General Calixto Garc√≠a planned an invasion whereby the navy would shell Daiquir√≠, Garc√≠a's Cuban troops would attack the Spaniards, and, in the meantime, U.S. ships would transport some Cuban troops to Caba√±as to cut off communications and supply. The landing two days later went almost according to plan. Sampson fired on Daiquir√≠, dispersing the 300 or so Spanish troops there. Some 16,000 U.S. soldiers waded ashore in the surf as the diversion at Caba√±as proved highly effective. Other troops landed at Siboney, but Daiquir√≠ continued as a storage area until U.S. forces took Santiago.Library of Congress The alcoholic cocktail, the daiquiri, was supposedly named for the area. There is an iron mine near Daiquir√≠, which is a word of Ta√≠no origin. The cocktail was supposedly invented about 1900 in a bar named Venus in Santiago, about 23 miles east of the mine, by a group of American mining engineers. Among the engineers present were Jennings Cox, General Manager of the Spanish American Iron Co., J. Francis Linthicum, C. Manning Combs, George W. Pfeiffer, De Berneire Whitaker, C. Merritt Holmes and Proctor O. Persing. Although stories persist that Cox invented the drink when he ran out of gin while entertaining American guests, the drink evolved naturally due to the prevalence of lime and sugar, and Bacard√≠ rum.

Born in Old Swan, Liverpool, Evans first played junior football for Wirral club Ellesmere Port Town. He had an unsuccessful trial with Wolves, before signing for London side Arsenal and moving to Harringay in January 1951. After two years in the reserve and youth sides, he made his first-team debut for Arsenal against Huddersfield Town on 22 August 1953. Although, only a bit-part player that season, the next season he became Arsenal's regular left back, succeeding Walley Barnes. Evans was an Arsenal regular for the rest of the decade, and he was an ever-present in 1955-56. During this time, he scored one of the most memorable own goals in football history; towards the end of a match against Blackpool on 17 December 1955, which Arsenal were winning 4‚Äì0, Evans heard a whistle from the crowd, and mistakenly thought the referee had blown for full-time. He kicked the ball in triumph, which ended up flying past Arsenal goalkeeper Con Sullivan and into his own net; the goal stood but Arsenal held on to win 4‚Äì1. With a calm composure, physical strength and a powerful left foot, Evans was rarely out of the Arsenal side during this time, and became Arsenal's preferred penalty taker in 1956; he scored twelve goals for the club in his 207 appearances, including seven in 1958-59. He even deputised for goalkeeper Jack Kelsey after the Welshman was injured in an FA Cup match in 1959. For a short spell he was also Arsenal captain, and he played for the London XI in the 1955-58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals. However, the Gunners were going through a lean spell and were unable to challenge for honours, meaning Evans never won a medal. Evans was Arsenal's first choice left back right up until a match against Wolves on 29 August 1959, in which he broke his ankle. After recovering, he was not quite the same player he was. With Billy McCullough coming through to replace him, he made only six more appearances for the first team that season (his last coming against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 January 1960), before stepping down to the Arsenal reserve side. He remained an Arsenal player until 1963, helping to coach to the youth and reserve teams, and later had a spell at Luton Town doing the same. After that he left football entirely and later worked as chauffeur. He died in 2000, aged 69.

The magazine was published in Canada by Polymancer Studios Inc.. It was distributed across the United States, across Canada, in the UK, in Australia, and in New Zealand, as well as having hard copies archived with Archives Canada (in Canada - Library and Archives Canada - reference to Issue #1). The first issue was published in 2004 and it ran for 32 issues.  Nature of Magazine and Content  Polymancer's articles and scenarios were written without reference to any specific rules system - there were a few exceptions to this rule where specific roleplaying game rule systems were referenced. The magazine for the most part was ‚Äúsystem- independent‚Äù so that ‚Äúplayers of different game systems could make use of them‚ÄùPolymancer magazine writing guidelines The magazine covered many gaming genres such as fantasy, science fiction, horror, modern day, pulp. Most roleplaying game magazines at that time, just covered fantasy, in large measure due to Dungeons & Dragons, a fantasy RPG that was (and continues to be) the most popular RPG of its kind. Polymancer was different from many magazines that covered RPGs by being printed. Many gaming magazines such as Pyramid were only available online. The April 19, 2007 announcement that Paizo Publishing's license to produce Dragon and Dungeon magazines was to end in September 2007, without being renewed,paizo.com - Dragon and Dungeon Transition\\"Paizo Publishing to Cease Publication of DRAGON and DUNGEON Magazines to continue through September 2007\\" http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/news/20070419a\\"Paizo Publishing to Cease Publication of Dragon and Dungeon.\\" Polyglot Volume #3 Issue #5 http://www.polymancer.com/polyglot/volume3/polyglot_volume3_issue4_2007_04_19.pdf left Polymancer as one of the few printed RPG hobby magazines geared towards consumers left (see the Wikipedia roleplaying game magazines category for a list). (Wizards announced that the two magazines will be replaced by a yet- unspecified \\"online initiative.\\") There was a complete adventure scenario in every issue of the magazine, which remained for the life of the publication as being ‚Äúplayable right out of the box.‚Äù A scenario map was included in each issue's center spread. There was also downloadable material to aid the gamemaster available on the publisher's web site for most of the scenarios. Articles in Polymancer tended to be long (over 4 pages) and the black and white illustrations differed from the color artwork found in Dragon. Polymancer was comparable to how Dragon was in the 1980s.ALTERWORLDS :: View topic - Polymancer Magazine The articles in Polymancer were eclectic but they appeared under a few regular headings: *‚ÄúJousting With Words‚Äù was the editorial. An opinion piece by the editor. *‚ÄúThe Lich‚Äôs Niche‚Äù was a ranting opinion column written in the form of an interview with a lich. *‚ÄúTech Talk‚Äù was about ways to use technology (especially computers) in gaming. It did not last beyond 2006. *‚ÄúGaming Digital‚Äù was about play by email games. *‚ÄúThe Gauntlet‚Äù was generally a column dealing with problems gamemasters might face and how to solve them. They tended to be instructional in tone. *‚ÄúMojo‚Äù was Polymancer's own generic game rules system. Each article grew the rule system in a serialized manner, it also presented additional rules should a particular entry for that iussue required them. Mojo was announced in issue #2 with the description that it was meant to be easy to convert to other game systems. Mojo was available for free from the magazine's website. *‚ÄúPlot Fodder‚Äù was about creating adventure ideas or more importantly adventure seeds and threads from everyday or general topics.  Adventure Scenarios  There was a full adventure scenario in every issue. During its run, Polymancer had horror, fantasy, post-apocalyptic, science fiction, pulp, cyberpunk, and Espionage scenarios. One scenario was written to be played as a set of linked miniatures wargame battles, as an RPG adventure, or both. Most Polymancer adventures were written for use with any RPG rules system, however, three adventures were written for specific RPGs: C.J. Carella's Witchcraft (by Eden Studios), Jovian Chronicles (by Dream Pod 9), and HARP (by I.C.E.). The latter two adventures had the statistics that were compatible with the rules for the games the adventures were written for side-by-side with Polymancer's own \\"Mojo\\" rules system (see below), which was written to be convertible into many other game rules systems. The Witchcraft adventure contained very few references to rules so it was hoped to be easily convertible into the rules for other horror RPGs.  Comics  More than one comic (or cartoon) appeared in Polymancer magazine during its publication run. There was a serial comic called ‚ÄúSideQuest‚Äù about a group of rolepayers that appeared in issues 1 through 8. As well as a one panel cartoon entitled \\"Quotable Quotes\\", that started in issue #8; this one panel cartoon was based on humorous quotes from games that were supplied the magazine's readership. There was also \\"Dice Quest\\" which began in issue #10, a 4 panel cartoon about the dice used by roleplayers; the characters being anthropomorphized polyhedral dice. Games Published in Polymancer magazine As of May 2009, three game rules systems had been published in Polymancer magazine as articles, Mojo, (a generic multipurpose rules system designed for the magazine) PUMMEL!, (a rules lite system designed for use by and inclusion in Polymancer during its initial publication run) and Space PUMMEL!. (a rules lite system designed for use by and inclusion in Polymancer during its initial publication run). Each of these game rules systems were implemented in Polymancer magazine in order to allow the content to contain usable game stats, while maintaining the publication's policy of being easily convertible to rules systems that the magazine's readers would prefer to use themselves. Each of these game systems was playable on its own, however. =Mojo= Mojo was a free role-playing game system designed to adapt to any campaign setting. The Mojo rules system were created by Polymancer Studios, Inc. in 2004 and was first offered in the publication in 2004, and first serialized in Polymancer in January 2005. Purpose of Mojo Mojo was a roleplaying game rules system developed by Polymancer Studios, Inc.. Mojo was described in the pages of Polymancer magazine as a \\"percentile-based system\\"\\"The Tomb of Genghis Khan\\" in Polymancer. Vol 2 Issue #6, p 19. and in Polymancer Studios's press releases as \\"the infinitely convertible‚Äö roleplaying rules system\\".http://www.pr.com/press-release/143836 The Mojo RPG was created as an \\"ultrageneric, barebones RPG system\\" The publisher described this rules system as one that was designed so that game statistics for tasks, skills, items, magic spells, and so on could be easily converted to their equivalents in other RPGs Reference to Mojo press release. They did this so that adventure scenarios, equipment articles, and scenario based content could contain material with relevant stats, and still be useful to as many different kinds of RPG players as possible. It was stressed that Polymancer Studios did not intend to create another generic RPG as a product, but rather as a tool to make the magazine more relevant. This was repeatedly stated by people who worked for Polymancer Studios in the magazine itself, and also in podcast interviewsAGC 94 December 30 2008 (Happy New Year IV)57 Private Sanctuary Format of publication Mojo was first introduced in Polymancer Volume 1, Issue #2.\\"Introducing‚Ä¶ Mojo!

As of May 2009, there were 16 published Mojo articles in Polymancer magazine. Basic rules Although based on percentile dice, Mojo differed from other percentile-based games such as Call of Cthulhu and Rolemaster. Basic task resolution was accomplished by rolling under the character's attribute + relevant skill + a modifier set by the gamemaster on an ad hoc basis. Combat used the same system.Mojo: Quickstart Rules for the Infinitely Convertible, Roleplaying Rules System. (Flyer) A free PDF of the Mojo rules system was available from the publisher's website.

The Political Film Society was founded in 1986 in Honolulu, Hawaii.IMDb Overview - Political Film Society, USA It was originally a project of the Hawaii Political Studies Association, but became an independent organization a few years later. The headquarters of the society moved from Honolulu to Hollywood in 1998. That same year the Society became a nonprofit organization, and began publishing film reviews on its website (see external link below). Reviews are reprinted on the website of the International Movie Data Base. Leaders Each year, at an annual meeting of members, three persons are elected to serve on the board of directors. The board, in turn, chooses the President, who is Chief Executive Officer. Political scientist Michael Haas, who serves on the board, has been the CEO of the Political Film Society since its inception and is the Society's President and Secretary. Currently, boardmember Vorathep Sitthitham is Vice President. Members Members select the board of directors. Those interested to become members must contact the Society through mail or email to join. Members in good standing are allowed to vote each year on the films up for the awards that the society hands out for the winners. There are around 200 members all over the world. Awards The Political Film Society awards movies each year with the Political Film Society Awards. These awards are given out to movies in five categories: Political Film Society Award for Democracy, Political Film Society Award for Expos√©, Political Film Society Award for Human Rights, Political Film Society Award for Peace, and the occasional Special Award. The awards are nicknamed \\"The Stanley Awards\\" after Stanley M. Castillo, an original member of the Political Film Society's board of directors who died in 1998 due to cancer.

A Time Reversal Mirror (TRM) is a device that can focus waves using the time reversal method. TRMs are also known as time reversal mirror arrays since they are usually arrays of transducers. TRM are well-known and have been used for decades in the optical domain. They are also used in the ultrasonic domain. Overview If the source is passive, i.e. some type of isolated reflector, an iterative technique can be used to focus energy on it. The TRM transmits a plane wave which travels toward the target and is reflected off it. The reflected wave returns to the TRM, where it looks as if the target has emitted a (weak) signal. The TRM reverses and retransmits the signal as usual, and a more focused wave travels toward the target. As the process is repeated, the waves become more and more focused on the target. Yet another variation is to use a single transducer and an ergodic cavity. Intuitively, an ergodic cavity is one that will allow a wave originating at any point to reach any other point. An example of an ergodic cavity is an irregularly shaped swimming pool: if someone dives in, eventually the entire surface will be rippling with no clear pattern. If the propagation medium is lossless and the boundaries are perfect reflectors, a wave starting at any point will reach all other points an infinite number of times. This property can be exploited by using a single transducer and recording for a long time to get as many reflections as possible. Theory The time reversal technique is based upon a feature of the wave equation known as reciprocity: given a solution to the wave equation, then the time reversal (using a negative time) of that solution is also a solution. This occurs because the standard wave equation only contains even order derivatives. Some media are not reciprocal (e.g. very lossy or noisy media), but many very useful ones are approximately so, including sound waves in water or air, ultrasonic waves in human bodies, and electromagnetic waves in free space. The medium must also be approximately linear. Time reversal techniques can be modeled as a matched filter. If a delta function is the original signal, then the received signal at the TRM is the impulse response of the channel. The TRM sends the reversed version of the impulse response back through the same channel, effectively autocorrelating it. This autocorrelation function has a peak at the origin, where the original source was. It is important to realize that the signal is concentrated in both space and time (in many applications, autocorrelation functions are functions of time only). Another way to think of a time reversal experiment is that the TRM is a \\"channel sampler\\". The TRM measures the channel during the recording phase, and uses that information in the transmission phase to optimally focus the wave back to the source. Experiments A notable researcher is Mathias Fink of √âcole Sup√©rieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris. His team has done numerous experiments with ultrasonic TRMs. An interesting experimentMathias Fink. Acoustic Time-Reversal Mirrors. Topics Appl. Phys. 84, 17-43. (2002) involved a single source transducer, a 96-element TRM, and 2000 thin steel rods located between the source and the array. The source sent a 1 Œºs pulse both with and without the steel scatterers. The source point was measured for both time width and spatial width in the retransmission step. The spatial width was about 6 times narrower with the scatterers than without. Moreover, the spatial width was less than the diffraction limit as determined by the size of the TRM with the scatterers. This is possible because the scatterers increased the effective aperture of the array. Even when the scatterers were moved slightly (on the order of a wavelength) in between the receive and transmit steps, the focusing was still quite good, showing that time reversal techniques can be robust in the face of a changing medium. In addition, Jos√© M. F. Moura of Carnegie Mellon University was leading a research team working to extend the principles of Time Reversal to electromagnetic waves,Jos√© M. F. Moura, Yuanwei Jin. \\"Detection by Time Reversal: Single Antenna\\",IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 55:1, pp. 187-201, January 2007 and they have achieved resolution in excess of the Rayleigh resolution limit, proving the efficacy of Time Reversal techniques. Their efforts are focused on radar systems, and trying to improve detection and imaging schemes in highly cluttered environments, where Time Reversal techniques seem to provide the greatest benefit. Applications The beauty of time reversal signal processing is that one need not know any details of the channel. The step of sending a wave through the channel effectively measures it, and the retransmission step uses this data to focus the wave. Thus one doesn't have to solve the wave equation to optimize the system, one only needs to know that the medium is reciprocal. Time reversal is therefore suited to applications with inhomogeneous media. An attractive aspect of time reversal signal processing is the fact that it makes use of multipath propagation. Many wireless communication systems must compensate and correct for multipath effects. Time reversal techniques use multipath to their advantage by using the energy from all paths. Fink imagines a cryptographic application based on the ergodic cavity configuration. The key would be composed of the locations of two transducers. One plays the message, the other records waves after they have bounced throughout the cavity; this recording will look like noise. When the recorded message is time reversed and played back, there is only one location to launch the waves from in order for them to focus. Given that the playback location is correct, only one other location will exhibit the focused message wave; all other locations should look noisy.

It is part of the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette. P√©tange lies on the borders with both Belgium and France. , the town of P√©tange, which lies in the north of the commune, has a population of 7,399. Other towns within the commune include Lamadelaine and Rodange. The commune is one of the smallest communes of Luxembourg, yet is the fifth-most populous. It is the most-populous commune without city status. History The modern settlement of P√©tange was first mentioned in 938 by the name 'Perdgitten'. Six centuries later, P√©tange had still not acquired much prominence; in 1536, it was home to only about 25 people. In 1601, the boundary between Luxembourg and the Duchy of Lorraine was definitively demarcated for the first time. The modern commune was divided between the two, with the town of P√©tange going to Luxembourg, but the towns of Rodange and Lamadelaine, which are further to the south, lying on the Lorrainian side of the border. When, in 1795, Luxembourg was annexed into Revolutionary France as part of the d√©partement of For√™ts, its former territories were reunited, and the commune's territory was established as it is today. However, when Luxembourg passed to the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, after the Congress of Vienna, the towns of Rodange and Lamadelaine passed with it. The town's importance grew greatly in the late nineteenth century, thanks to the booming iron-mining and steel industries. The first railway into P√©tange was opened in 1873, running to Esch-sur-Alzette. Further railway lines were added to Ettelbruck (1873) and Luxembourg City (1900). On 9 September 1944, P√©tange became the first commune in the country to be liberated by Allied soldiers at the end of the German occupation in the Second World War. In remembrance to the first soldier to die in the liberation, a memorial was erected in his honor: Hyman Josefson Square. On October 8, 2019, a tornado hit the town; this is a rare occurrence in Luxembourg. 19 people were injured, two seriously, and over 160 buildings were destroyed. https://www.dw.com/en/tornado-leaves-trail- of-destruction-in-luxembourg/a-49974893 Geography The commune lies in the extreme south-west of Luxembourg, bordering both the French d√©partement of Meurthe-et-Moselle and the Belgian province of Luxembourg. The town of Rodange lies just across the border from the Belgian town of Aubange. P√©tange is situated at the west end of the Red Lands: iron-rich sedimentary rocks that form the far south and south-west of Luxembourg. The town lies in the upper reaches of the Chiers valley, and is one of the few places in Luxembourg (along with the commune of Differdange) to lie outside the drainage system of the Rhine. The commune is only in area, one of the smallest in Luxembourg, but is the site of three significant towns. The town of P√©tange itself has a population of 6,909, but, despite being the seventh-largest town in Grand Duchy, accounts for under half of the population of the commune. Rodange, in the south-west of the commune, is home to 4,505 people, whilst Lamadelaine, in the south of the commune, has a population of 2,335. Attractions The south of the commune is home to Titelberg, a prominent hill on top of which lie the ruins of a Celtic oppidum. The walled hill fort was long. The entire settlement had a total population of 10,000 before the Roman conquest, making it the largest pre-Roman settlement in Luxembourg. P√©tange is the home of the Grand-Duchy's largest pre-Lenten Karneval celebration. Annually hosting a calvalacade with roughly 1200 participants and thousand of participants, the official name is Karneval Gemeng P√©iteng or Kagepe (the initials in Luxembourgish are pronounced Ka, Ge and Pe). The Fond de Gras heritage railway and museum recreate the conditions of the Red Lands in the year 1900, at the height of their growth and development. Whilst the centre lies just within the commune of Differdange, to the east, the two steam locomotives take visitors to the towns of P√©tange and Rodange, and provide a stream of tourists to the towns in the summer. P√©tange has a football team in Luxembourg's top-flight National Division, called CS P√©tange. They play their home games at the Stade Municipal. Despite being one of the oldest Luxembourgian clubs in existence, having been founded in 1910, P√©tange have won only one trophy, the Luxembourg Cup in 2004-05.

Public-benefit nonprofit corporations  A public-benefit nonprofit corporationCalifornia Code - Part 2: NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS [5110. - 6910. is a type of nonprofit corporation chartered by a state government, and organized primarily or exclusively for social, educational, recreational or charitable purposes by like-minded citizens. Public-benefit nonprofit corporations are distinct in the law from mutual-benefit nonprofit corporations in that they are organized for the general public benefit, rather than for the interest of its members. They are also distinct in the law from religious corporations.  Religious corporation  A religious corporation is a nonprofit corporation organized to promote religious purposes. Often these types of corporations are recognized under the law on a subnational level, for instance by a state or province government. The government agency responsible for regulating such corporations is usually the official holder of records, for instance a state Secretary of State. Religious corporations are formed like all other nonprofit corporations by filing articles of incorporation with the state. Religious corporation articles need to have the standard tax exempt language the IRS requires. Religious corporations are subject to less rigorous state and federal filing and reporting requirements than many other tax-exempt organizations, such as mutual benefit nonprofit corporations, or public benefit nonprofit corporations.Tax Information for Churches and Religious Organizations Depending on the state in which they are located, they may also be exempt from some of the inspections or regulations governing non-religious groups performing the same services. =Corporation sole= Religious corporations are permitted to designate a person to act in the capacity of corporation sole.  Mutual-benefit nonprofit corporations  A mutual-benefit nonprofit corporation or membership corporation, in the United States, is a type of nonprofit corporation chartered by a state government that exists to serve its members in ways other than obtaining and distributing profits to them. Therefore, it cannot obtain IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit status as a charitable organization.http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/corp/pdf/articles/corp_artsnp.pdf A mutual-benefit corporation can be non-profit or not-for-profit, but it still must pay regular corporate tax rates. A mutual benefit corporation will pay the same taxes as a regular for-profit corporation. (C corporation tax rates). Mutual benefit corporations must still file tax returns and pay income tax because they are not formed for a purpose that anyone in the world could benefit from. Mutual benefit corporations are formed for nonprofit purposes like managing a condo association, a downtown business district, or a homeowners association.

It was released in 1992 through Metal Blade Records and is the last album recorded with the band's original lineup, as founding guitarist Bob Rusay was fired after the album's release. The album was banned in Germany, due to the violent cover and the extreme nature of the lyrics. Because the liner notes on Butchered at Birth feature quotations from American serial killer Albert Fish, he is often incorrectly credited with being the voice at the beginning of \\"Addicted to Vaginal Skin\\".

She was named for Rear Admiral James Joseph Raby (1874-1934). Raby was laid down on 7 June 1943 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company, Bay City, Michigan, Rear Admiral Raby's home town. The ship was named Raby on 22 June 1943, and launched on 4 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. James Joseph Raby, the Admiral's widow. She was commissioned on 7 December 1943 at New Orleans, Louisiana, with Lieutenant Commander J. Scott II, in command. Service history =World War II, 1943-1945= After shakedown off Bermuda, Raby sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 10 February 1944 via the Panama Canal for Noum√©a, arriving on 11 March. She then escorted fast convoys from Guadalcanal as far as Manus Island, in the Admiralties. Raby was engaged in hunter-killer activities in the Solomons during the early spring. On 16 May, she sailed from Florida Island, in the Solomons, in a hunter-killer group with and on what was to become one of the most successful anti-submarine actions in the Pacific war. During this patrol from 19 to 31 May, the three-ship team sank six Japanese submarines (, , , , , and ) in waters north of the Bismarck Archipelago. Raby resumed convoy escort missions at the end of June, remaining in the Solomons until 26 October when she got underway for Manus for similar duty in the Admiralties. In December, she shifted to Ulithi. On the evening of 21 January 1945, a plane spotted a Japanese submarine on the surface 18 miles due west of Ulithi. The alarm brought a hunter killer team composed of DEs Raby, and steaming quickly from Uithi. The three ships conducted an expanding search that lasted all day and night on the 22nd. Early in the morning of the 23rd, radar contact was made. After the submarine submerged, sonar contact was established. Several attempts with hedgehog mortars resulted in the destruction of Japanese submarine . At the end of January, Raby proceeded to Guam where she served as escort and patrol ship into June. Between 22 June and 31 August, she completed two slow tows to Okinawa, and on 13 September, she steamed for Pearl Harbor and the United States. =Post-war activities, 1946-1953= Remaining in California waters through the winter, she underwent a conversion where the three-inch guns were replaced by two single 5-inch guns and a hedgehog anti-submarine launcher. She reported to the 7th Fleet for duty in the Far East on 6 April 1946, rescuing on the same day the crew of a downed B-29 bomber. She subsequently put into Hong Kong, Kiirun, Shanghai, and Tsingtao, reaching Okinawa on 26 June. She operated out of Okinawa, China, and Japan until returning to San Diego on 9 April 1947. She was assigned to Task Force 15 and made two runs from the west coast to Pearl Harbor before getting underway on 7 December for Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Bikini where she arrived on 1 May 1948. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 27 May and to San Diego on 28 January 1949. She conducted local operations on the west coast, making two trips to Pearl Harbor during the rest of the year. Reclassified as control escort ship DEC-698 on 2 November 1949, Raby transited the Panama Canal on 25 January 1950, and arrived at Norfolk on 1 February. During the next 3¬Ω years, she operated alternately in the Norfolk area and in the Caribbean. =Decommissioning and sale, 1953-1968= She was at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, from June to September 1953 for deactivation, and she arrived in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet berthing area at St. James River, Florida, on 24 September. Raby decommissioned on 22 December 1953. She was re-designated back to DE-698 on 27 December 1957. She was transferred to the Orange, Texas, berthing area in 1960. Raby was struck from the Navy List on 1 June 1968, and subsequently sold for scrap. Awards Raby earned three battle stars for World War II service.

He was a member of the Repeal Association and the Irish Confederation. He qualified as an M.D. in 1836, became a member of Kilkenny Corporation and was Mayor twice. He was the model for Dr. Kiely in Charles J. Kickham's Knocknagow. He was MD of the University of Glasgow. He influenced James Stephens and Charles Kickham. He corresponded with Thomas Davis. He was visited by Charles Gavan Duffy and by Thomas Carlyle. Robert Cane was educated locally and then worked for a time as an assistant to a pharmacist. He later went on to study medicine at Trinity College Dublin and at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. During his time at Trinity he became involved in student politics and attended meetings about national issues of the day. He returned to Kilkenny to give medical assistance during the cholera epidemic of 1832. Robert Cane later moved to Edinburgh where he was awarded his MD at Edinburgh Medical School in 1836. Following graduation from Edinburgh, Cane returned to Kilkenny where he set up a practice in the city. He became involved in national affairs and in local politics in Kilkenny where he was friendly with the writer John Banim. He also joined Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association. In 1840 he hosted a banquet for Daniel O'Connell during a visit by the Liberator to the city. Robert Cane was elected Mayor of Kilkenny in 1844. William Smith O'Brien founded the Irish Confederation in 1847 when he and others withdrew from the Repeal Association. Robert Cane joined the Confederation, however his views, particularly on the use of violence, were at variance with the Confederation and he took no part in the Rising of 1848. Despite this he was arrested and imprisoned following the Young Irelander Rebellion in the year 1848 on 29 July. The Rising had led to the suspension of Habeas Corpus and resulted in Cane being imprisoned for a lengthy period. Following his release he was again elected mayor of Kilkenny. On 19 February 1849 he was one of group of people who met to establish an Archaeological Society for the 'County and City of Kilkenny and surrounding districts'. He was eventually elected chairman of the organisation Kilkenny Archaeological Society on 3 April 1849. Dr Cane founded the Celtic Union in Kilkenny in 1853. It was a literary society with a strong political bias and intended to publish material relating to Irish history. The Union produced a magazine called 'The Celt' and Cane acted as editor. Dr Cane died of consumption on 16 August 1858. He is buried in St. John's Graveyard, very close to his friend John Banim. In 1859 a series of articles entitled 'History of the Williamite and Jacobite Wars of Ireland from their origin to the capture of Athlone' which he had written were published by the Celtic Union.

Champaign, IL: Center for Watershed Science - Illinois State Water Survey. Located at the convergence of four major physiographic regions, the river is part of the largest complex of wetlands in Illinois. The Cache River Wetlands ‚Äî America's northernmost cypress/tupelo swamp ‚Äî harbors 91 percent of the state's high quality swamp and wetland communities. It provides habitat for more than 100 threatened and endangered species in Illinois. In 1996, the Cache was designated a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention. A significant portion of the Cache River Wetlands are protected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1990, covers of aquatic and riparian habitat, and is eventually planned to expand to . The Illinois Department of Natural Resources' Cache River State Natural Area protects another . And local landowners, through Wetlands Reserve Program easements with Natural Resources Conservation Service, protect an additional of restored wetlands. Also through NRCS, landowners are using a variety of conservation practices, such as conservation tillage, grassed waterways and reforestation; many of these practices are through NRCS‚Äô Environmental Quality Incentives and Wildlife Habitat Programs. In all, more than of private lands are using some sort of NRCS conservation program in the Cache River Watershed. The Lower Cache River, a habitat that encompasses much of these landholdings, has been listed as a U.S. National Natural Landmark. The Heron Pond ‚Äì Little Black Slough Nature Preserve, another National Natural Landmark, is located within the upper stretch of the Cache, upstream from the Post Creek Cutoff. History A swamp along the river The Cache River area was used as a trading crossroads by Native Americans, and has several sites of archeological interest within its boundaries, including the Cypress CitadelSIU, DNR team up to study prehistoric settlement site just south of Cypress, Illinois. French voyageurs gave the river its modern name, calling it Cache, which means secret or hidden place. American settlers arrived in the region in 1803. They found the soil too wet for farming, and the swamps full of mosquitoes and venomous snakes; many early settlers died of malaria. According to legend, from about, 1790s-1820, Colonel Plug, a river pirate, ran a gang of cutthroats and preyed on unsuspecting travelers, near the mouth of the Ohio River, stealing their goods and sinking or selling their watercraft down river. However, the Cache provided excellent hunting and fishing, and abundant timber. Belknap, IL resident W. Marshall stated that the Cache River Basin was ‚Äúgood country for men and dogs, but powerful trying on women and oxen.‚Äù Between 1810 and 1890 timber harvesting became a major industry in the Cache basin, cypress wood being sought for its light, water-resistant properties. The small towns on the edge of the swamp experienced a small boom during this period. Several sawmills and small factories sprung up to process timber for lumber, railroad ties, charcoal, and packing crates and boxes. Drainage and diversion After most of the accessible timber was cut, local industry shifted to agriculture, and a program of diversion and draining began. The landscape changed dramatically, largely due to a diversion channel that was cut to connect the Cache and the nearby Ohio River. Constructed in 1912‚Äì1915, the Post Creek Cutoff divided the Cache into two watersheds; the Upper Cache, which drains down the diversion channel to the Ohio; and the Lower Cache, which drains to the original outlet on the Mississippi River. In 1952, the Karnak levee was constructed, further cementing the division between the two rivers. In 1950, about north of the Cache's natural mouth at the Ohio River, a diversion channel was created to connect the Cache and Mississippi rivers. Those last of the Cache continue to drain into the Ohio through the original channel. In 2002, the levee dividing the Post Creek Cutoff and the Lower Cache suffered a catastrophic failure during the spring flood season. The failure of the levee has resulted in dropping water levels in the Lower Cache. An interesting effect of this diversion is that in times of high water direction of flow on the lower Cache reverses, flowing east to the diversion channel. When the water level in the lower Cache drops below the diversion channel level, flow resumes its westerly travel to the Mississippi. Also, because of the breach, this section of the Cache is exposed to increased risk from flooding.Demissie, M., Bekele, E., Lian, Y., Keefer, L. (2010). Hydrologic and Hydraulic Modeling for Evaluating Alternatives for Managed Connection of the Upper and Lower Cache Rivers. Champaign, IL: Center for Watershed Science - Illinois State Water Survey. The future of the levee, however, remains uncertain. Management of the levee falls to Big Creek Drainage District No. 2. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers no longer considers the levee in its programs, making it ineligible for federal funding. The Cache River Wetlands Joint Venture Partnership (composed of Ducks Unlimited, Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Natural Resources Conservation Service, The Nature Conservancy and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) is considering a restoration project that could repair the levee as part of its efforts to restore low water flow. To date, two reports on this subject, created by the Center for Watershed Science at the Illinois State Water Survey, are publicly available. Conservation efforts Heron Pond in the Cache River State Natural Area. Sedimentation resulting from diversion and erosion Since the mid-1980s, efforts have been made to restore the Cache to something more like its historic state. The Citizens Committee to Save the Cache River, a grassroots organization of hunters, fishermen, and nature lovers, enlisted the help of state and federal agencies as well as non-profit groups such as The Nature Conservancy to form the Cache River Wetlands Joint Venture Partnership. Over the past fifteen years efforts have been made to control erosion, reduce siltation, stabilize water levels, restore game species habitat and provide recreational opportunities to the public. One long-term goal of the joint venture is to restore the hydrologic continuity of the Upper and Lower Cache. Over the course of the restoration work, there have been tensions between the conservationists and some local landowners. Some of the region's farmers feared that restoration of the wetlands would cause flooding and loss of agricultural land, and many resented what they perceived as ‚Äòoutside influences‚Äô meddling in their communities. Some local sportsmen feared that their favorite hunting and fishing grounds would either be put off limits, or else overrun by visitors. State and Federal agencies have attempted at all times to reach compromise with local landowners and sportsmen, but tensions and resentment remain. The Cache offers ample recreation opportunities, such as canoeing, hiking, bird watching, fishing and hunting. The Henry N. Barkhausen Cache River Wetlands Center interprets the unique natural and cultural history of the Cache River Wetlands. The center also forms the southern anchor to the Tunnel Hill State Trail ‚Äì a favorite with bike enthusiasts. The trail provides an excellent look at the sloughs and bottomland forest as it follows the disused Norfolk Southern Railway grade (originally owned by the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad) from Karnak to Vienna, then continues north through the Shawnee National Forest to Harrisburg, Illinois. The wetland center also contains information about places to hike, canoe, fish, hunt or watch birds in the Cache River region. The Friends of the Cache River Watershed is an organization that promotes natural resource conservation throughout the five county Cache River watershed. The organization focuses on environmental education, resource conservation, management and related issues throughout the Cache Watershed. The organization advocates sustainable agriculture and forestry practices and the restoration of wetlands, bottomland and upland forests. Friends of the Cache River Watershed facilitate a common meeting ground for a variety of individuals associated with agriculture business, education, tourism, rural communities, special interest groups, government agencies - all individuals that have an interest in the environment and natural resource protection and restoration.

The film stars Larenz Tate, Joe Morton, Suzzanne Douglass, Glynn Turman, Jada Pinkett and Vanessa Bell Calloway. Plot Set in the summer of 1976, the film follows the adventures of Drew Tate (Larenz Tate), an autistic 16-year- old from upstate New York, when he and his family spend two weeks with affluent relatives on Martha's Vineyard. Drew's parents, Kenny (Joe Morton) and Brenda (Suzzanne Douglass), worry that their son is emotionally disturbed. His favorite companion is a doll, in which he names Iago (after the character in the Shakespeare classic Othello), with which he engages in animated conversations. They also fear that a fire he accidentally set in the family garage foreshadows a future as an arsonist. On Martha's Vineyard, Drew is thrown into an affluent, party-loving black society that congregates on a beach known as the Inkwell. The visit is also the occasion of some bitter family strife. Drew's Aunt Francis (Vanessa Bell Calloway) and her husband, Spencer (Glynn Turman), are conservatives whose walls are plastered with pictures of Republican dignitaries such as Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan (who they keep saying will become President someday). Kenny, a former Black Panther, and Spencer argue furiously about racial issues. The Inkwell follows Drew's bumbling pursuit of the insufferably snooty Lauren (Jada Pinkett). He also befriends Heather (Adrienne-Joi Johnson), a young woman whose husband, Harold (Morris Chestnut), is a faithless louse.

Since the Lord Chancellor no longer sits as a judge, the Remembrancer is the oldest judicial position in continual existence. The post was created in 1154 by King Henry II as the chief official in the Exchequer Court, whose purpose was \\"to put the Lord Treasurer and the Barons of Court in remembrance of such things as were to be called upon and dealt with for the benefit of the Crown\\", a primary duty being to keep records of the taxes, paid and unpaid. The first King's Remembrancer was Richard of Ilchester, a senior servant of the Crown and later Bishop of Winchester. The King's Remembrancer continued to sit in the Court of the Exchequer until its abolition in 1882. The post of Queen's Remembrancer is held by the Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court. Quit Rents ceremonies The Exchequer Court is reconstituted every year for the three ancient ceremonies of the \\"Rendering of the Quit Rents to the Crown\\" by the City of London at the Royal Courts of Justice. The oldest dates from 1211, where the City pays service for two pieces of land, The Moors near Bridgnorth in Shropshire, for which the City must pay two knives, one blunt and one sharp. The second oldest has been made, entered in the Great Roll of the Exchequer, since 1235, for 'The Forge' in Tweezer's Alley, just south of St Clement's Dane, near the Strand in London, for which the City must pay six horseshoes and 61 horseshoe nails‚Äîover 550 years old, since after being rendered to the Queen's Remembrancer they are preserved in his office, and with the permission of the Crown they are loaned to the Corporation of London to be rendered again the following year. These two quits are paid together as one ceremony, during which a black-and-white chequered cloth is spread out‚Äîit is from this that the word \\"Exchequer\\" derives‚Äîcombined with the introduction to the Remembrancer of the City's newly elected sheriffs. The Comptroller and Solicitor of the City of London presents the horseshoes and nails and counts them out to the Remembrancer who then pronounces \\"Good number.\\" The knives are tested by the Queen's Remembrancer by taking a hazel stick, one cubit in length, and bending it over the blunt knife and leaving a mark, and the stick is split in two with the sharp knife. This practice stems from the creation of tally sticks where a mark was made on a stick with a blunt knife for each payment counted. When payment was complete the stick was split down the middle, leaving each party with half of the marked stick and creating a receipt (or foil and counter-foil). After the knives are tested the Remembrancer pronounces \\"Good service\\". The third quit rent dates from 1327, and is for ¬£11 in regard to the reserved interest of the Crown for the 'town of Southwark'. In that year the City was granted its fourth-oldest Royal Charter to acquire Southwark from Edward III for this annual payment. It was specifically retained by Edward VI in the 1550 charter to the City, which extended its jurisdiction over the outlying parts of Southwark. This quit is rendered by the Foreman of the City's Court Leet Jury of the \\"Town and Borough of Southwark\\", alias Guildable Manor, which is the area as defined in 1327. The continuation of this body is sanctioned under the Administration of Justice Act 1977. The ceremony takes place in the Cathedral library, the Glaziers' Hall or London's City Hall.www.london.gov.uk/city-hall This sum is rendered onto the Exchequer Cloth in the form of Crowns (5 shilling pieces, equivalent to 25 new pence), which remain legal tender. The Remembrancer pronounces \\"Good service\\" and this is witnessed by the Clerk of the City's Chamberlain's Court and the manor jurors to note that the payment has been made. Trial of the Pyx The Trial of the Pyx is a ceremony dating from 1249, formerly held in the Exchequer Court, now in Goldsmiths' Hall. The Queen's Remembrancer swears in a jury of 26 Goldsmiths who then count, weigh and otherwise measure a sample of 88,000 gold coins produced by the Royal Mint. The term \\"Pyx\\" refers to the name of the box in which the coins are kept. Forest of Dean In 1688, King James II directed the King's Remembrancer to appoint Commissioners to supervise the planting of trees in the Forest of Dean. The Forest was an important source of iron, coal and timber to the Monarch, but had been neglected during the Commonwealth. Other responsibilities The Queen's Remembrancer is responsible for nomination of the high sheriffs to each county of England and Wales, except Cornwall, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside, who are selected by the Duke of Lancaster (i.e. the sovereign) via the Pricking ceremony. The Remembrancer presents the Lord Mayor of the City of London to the Lord Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls and other High Court judges at the Royal Courts of Justice on Lord Mayor's Day. The Queen's Remembrancer presents newly appointed Sheriffs of the City with a Writ of Approbation from the monarch, sealed with the Great Silver Seal of the Exchequer. This takes place at the same time as the Quit Rents.

(commonly known as Spencer's) operated a department store chain in the province of British Columbia, Canada during the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Founded in the city of Victoria in 1873 by David W. Spencer, the first store, located on Government Street, consisted of a dry goods shop operating under the name \\"Spencer and Denny\\". The store prospered and expanded, and a second store was opened in 1890 in Nanaimo. The Vancouver store, which opened in 1907, was so successful that it soon expanded to occupy almost an entire city block. Other stores later opened in Chilliwack and New Westminster. For a number of years, Spencer's was a rival to the Woodward's department store, another British Columbia-based chain. In 1948, however, Spencer's was acquired by the much larger Eaton's department store chain, which had stores across Canada. The nine Spencer's stores in the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island were converted into Eaton's stores. The second Spencer's store in downtown Victoria, at 1150 Douglas Street (which replaced the original Government Street store), operated as an Eaton's store until the late 1980s, when it was demolished to make way for the Victoria Eaton Centre shopping mall (now called the Bay Centre). Spencer's downtown Vancouver store, on Hastings Street, operated as an Eaton's store until 1973, when Eaton's opened its new Vancouver flagship store in the newly constructed Pacific Centre shopping mall. Unlike its Victoria cousin, however, the former Spencer's store was not demolished; it was later occupied by Simpsons-Sears, and today it serves as the downtown \\"Harbour Centre\\" campus of Simon Fraser University. The building itself is currently called the Harbour Centre. The last operating vestiges of the former Spencer's chain disappeared with the demise of the Eaton's chain in 1999.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 14, 1991. In the episode, Marge asks Homer to find a husband for her sister Selma. Homer invites Principal Skinner to dinner after Bart gets caught vandalizing the school's lawn. Skinner's dinner with the Simpsons fails to go as planned when he instead falls for Selma's twin sister Patty. The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Mark Kirkland. The characters Hans Moleman, Groundskeeper Willie and Squeaky Voiced Teen make their first appearances on The Simpsons in this episode. \\"Principal Charming\\" features cultural references to films such as Vertigo, Gone with the Wind, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.1, and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. Plot After attending the wedding of a coworker, Selma begs Marge to help her find a husband. Marge asks Homer to help find a husband for her sister, but he struggles to find anyone suitable. When Bart is caught spelling his name on the school's lawn by killing the grass with an herbicide, Principal Skinner summons Homer to his office to discuss the prank. After learning that Skinner is single, Homer invites him to dinner. When Skinner arrives at the Simpsons' house, Homer accidentally introduces him to Patty instead of Selma; Skinner is instantly smitten with her, making Selma feel even worse about her marriage prospects. Skinner asks Patty for a date, but she is reluctant. Selma encourages her to go on her first date in 25 years and warns her this may be her last chance to marry. Patty does not enjoy her first date with Skinner, but they keep seeing each other, much to Selma's chagrin. Because of his love for Patty, Skinner allows Bart do whatever he wants at school. He soon enlists Bart's help to persuade Patty to marry him. Homer arranges a date between Barney and Selma, which she reluctantly attends. Following Bart's lead, Skinner uses an herbicide to write \\"Marry Me Patty\\" on the school's lawn. Skinner takes her to the top of the school's bell tower to propose marriage. Patty is flattered, but she declines because she and Selma share a special bond as twin sisters. Patty appreciates Skinner's understanding and gentlemanly conduct. She admits that were she ever to settle down with a man, she would marry him. After rescuing Selma from her date with Barney, Patty drives her home to their apartment. Single again, Skinner reasserts his authority over Bart by destroying the entire lawn with herbicide and forcing him to repair the damage by replanting the field seed by seed, much to Groundskeeper Willie's satisfaction. Production Dan Castellaneta provided the voice of several new characters. The episode was written by David M. Stern and directed by Mark Kirkland. Stern particularly liked writing episodes about Marge and her sisters Patty and Selma. Executive producer Mike Reiss said none of the staff members could relate on a personal level to the twins, but Stern \\"seemed to really hook in to them, so he did some great episodes featuring members of the Bouvier family.\\" Due to the episode's romantic theme, the airdate was pushed back to Valentine's Day on February 14, 1991. It was, however, ready to be aired several months earlier. The characters Hans Moleman, Groundskeeper Willie and Squeaky Voiced Teen made their first appearances on the show in \\"Principal Charming\\". Willie's role in the episode was to punish Bart by making him re-sod the grass. Originally, Willie was just written as an angry janitor, and the fact that he was Scottish was added during a recording session. Dan Castellaneta was assigned to do the voice, but he did not know what voice to use. Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, told Castellaneta to use an accent. He first tried using a Spanish voice, which Simon felt was too clich√©d. He then tried a \\"big dumb Swede\\", which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. Originally thought by the directors to be a one-shot appearance, Willie has since become a common recurring character. The show's creator Matt Groening later revealed that the character was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas, and Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in thirty- three Laurel and Hardy films. In addition to Willie, Castellaneta also provided the voice of Squeaky Voiced Teen, whose voice is lifted from actor Richard Crenna's character Walter Denton in the sitcom Our Miss Brooks.Castellaneta, Dan (2004). Commentary for \\"Boy-Scoutz N the Hood\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Moleman's voice was also provided by Castellaneta. While his driver's license in this episode showed his name as \\"Ralph Melish,\\" he was later given the name Moleman by Groening, who thought the character looked like a mole. Cultural references The scene with Skinner climbing the bell tower to get a better look of where the sodium tetrasulfate smell is coming from is a reference to the final scene of the 1958 film Vertigo. Moleman's drivers license says his name is Ralph Melish, a reference to the Monty Python sketch \\"The Adventures of Ralph Melish: Hot Dog and Knickers\\" from the 1973 album The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief. While searching for a man worthy of Selma, Homer imagines himself using a computer-enhanced overlay on his vision, similar to characters from the films Westworld, The Terminator and RoboCop. Skinner sings the song \\"Inchworm\\" by Danny Kaye as he rings the bell to Patty and Selma's apartment. Skinner carries Patty up the steps of the bell tower as Quasimodo did with Esmeralda in the 1939 film The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Selma sings Lisa a lullaby version of the song \\"Brandy\\" by Elliot Lurie. When Patty bids farewell to Skinner, she says, \\"Goodnight, sweet principal\\", a reference to \\"Goodnight, sweet prince\\" from Hamlet. When Skinner returns to school, he declares that \\"Tomorrow is another school day!\\", a reference to the line \\"Tomorrow is another day!\\" from the 1939 film Gone with the Wind. During Stanley and Martha Peterson's wedding, their vows include two lines from The Beatles' song \\"Martha My Dear\\". Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Principal Charming\\" finished thirty-second in the ratings for the week of February 11‚Äì17, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 14.1, equivalent to approximately thirteen million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \\"Good fun, with both Patty and Selma gaining a degree of humanity. Bart makes very good use of his new-found freedom as Skinner's pseudo-in-law, much to the annoyance of Groundskeeper Willie, making his first appearance.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: \\"Many shows might have trouble concentrating on secondary characters like Skinner and Patty, but this episode worked nicely. Though the romantic tone could have become sappy, the program managed to stay on the right side of that equation, and it expanded the characters well.\\" Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, wrote that \\"the [episode] is heavily character orientated but poignantly comical\\". A member of the IGN staff wrote in a season two review: \\"There are some real winners to be found in the second season, and I was actually surprised at some of the episodes in the collection because I thought they were later in the series, like [...] 'Principal Charming', where Skinner falls for Patty.\\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic said \\"Principal Charming\\" was the episode that made it \\"clear that The Simpsons wasn't just a smart little cartoon but something much, much more.\\" The episode's references to Gone with the Wind and Terminator were named the sixth and fifth greatest film references in the history of the show by Nathan Ditum of Total Film. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the best line of the episode was Moe's line to the depressed Homer: \\"Homer, lighten up.

He is credited with numerous firsts, including, bringing the first Thai-script printing press to Siam, publishing the first Thai newspaper and monolingual Thai dictionary, performing the first surgery in Siam, and introducing Western medicine and technology. Early life Dan Bradley House, Marcellus, NY Dan Beach Bradley was born on 18 July 1804 in Marcellus, New York. He was the son of Judge and Pastor Dan Bradley of Whitehall, New York, and Eunice Beach. Eunice died soon after giving birth to her son. As a child, Dan Beach Bradley was an astounding scholar and he loved to read. When Bradley was 20 years old, he suffered a week of deafness and it caused him to examine his spiritual life. Two years after this incident, Bradley dedicated his life to serve Jesus Christ. Bradley thought that his age was not appropriate to study for the ministry so he began studying medicine in the office of an Auburn physician. Bradley took a brief reprieve from his studies due to health concerns, but resumed his studies for a year in Penn Yan, New York. After a year of studying, Bradley attended lectures at Harvard University in 1830 before taking another break to earn money to continue his education. Bradley enrolled at New York University and graduated in April 1833 as a Doctor of Medicine. In November 1832, he had been accepted as a missionary physician by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). Bradley had initially wanted to marry one of his two cousins, Jane Bradley or Hannah Goodyear. Jane, however, was only 16 years old and was not in a position to marry Bradley and Goodyear had no desire to serve as a missionary in Asia. After a brief mail courtship, on 5 June 1834 Bradley married Emilie Royce before the couple set sail for Siam. Emilie, like Bradley, wanted to serve God as a missionary. Mission to Siam On 2 July 1834, Bradley and his wife, Emilie departed from Boston for their mission to Bangkok. On 12 January 1835, they arrived in Singapore. Due to monsoons, Bradley and his wife stayed in an unoccupied London Missionary Society home for six months, until the storms finally passed. Bradley and his wife arrived in Siam on 18 July 1835 after an encounter with Malay pirates that left goods stolen and four crew members dead. They had the following children: Charles Bradley born March 1835 in transit, died 4 November 1836 in Bangkok; Emelie Jane Bradley, born 26 November 1836 in Marcellus, New York, died 27 July 1848 in Bangkok; Harriet Bradley born 7 May 1842, died in Bangkok 30 December 1842 of smallpox. Their last child was Cornelius Beach Bradley (18 November 1843 ‚Äì 17 March 1936). Emilie Royce Bradley died in 1845 of unspecified illnesses. Her papers included an album and two diaries (1827-1830; 1831-1833; 1840-1842) kept in Clinton, New York. Those in Bangkok include a microfilm copy and a modern transcription of a diary (1834-1836), the original of which may still remain in private hands; a journal letter written aboard ship during her voyage to Siam in 1834-1835; and a record book containing summaries of letters sent. The summaries often refer to \\"my large letter book\\", probably indicating that only a portion of Emilie's correspondence has survived. During his first few years in Thailand, Bradley suffered from chronic diarrhea, a sickness that he said had to happen initially in order to survive. After his initial sickness, he enjoyed 30 years of almost unbroken good health. He established a daily routine of cold baths, plain food, and total abstinence from intoxicating beverages. A healthy variety of cares enabled him to find rest by turning from one task to another. Throughout his time in Thailand, he was constantly found singing hymns, reading the bible, and in prayer. Life as a missionary During his time as a missionary, Bradley was frequently at odds with his mission sponsors. On 4 December 1847, Bradley resigned from the ABCFM due to his disagreement with the organization on the doctrine of Christian perfectionism. With no funds coming from the ABCFM, Bradley was forced to take a three‚àíyear sojourn in the US to raise funds to continue in Bangkok under the sponsorship of another organization. His time in America raising funds and betrothing his second wife was the only break in Bradley's time in Bangkok. One of Bradley's notebooks records his stays in Oberlin, Ohio, and West Haven, Connecticut, between 1847 and 1850. In January 1848, Bradley became associated with the American Missionary Association (AMA) that had just been founded in Albany, New York on 3 September 1846. It was at Oberlin College that he met Sarah Blachly, who became his second wife on 1 November 1848 in Dane, Wisconsin. At the end of October 1849, they set sail for Siam and, after a voyage even more difficult than the first, he was able to resume his calling in Bangkok by the end of May 1850. Sarah Bradley died 16 August 1893, never once having left Thailand. They had the following children: Sarah Adorna Bradley, born 8 April 1850 in Singapore; Dwight Blachly Bradley, 13 October 1852 in Bangkok, died 10 September 1939 in Northboro, Massachusetts; Irene Belle Bradley, 19 May 1860 in Bangkok, where she died in 1943, unmarried. The AMA gave Bradley limited resources for mission work, forcing him to focus on making money. Bradley worked as a doctor and also as a merchant to support his mission. Bradley was regarded as an unofficial American consul. He was disappointed at the lack of Christian converts his mission produced. Bradley pointed out many flaws with both the missionaries and the local Thai people. In Bradley's view, the missionaries did not keep the Sabbath strictly enough and requested medical leave far too quickly. Bradley criticized Buddhism and numerous practices that he saw in Thai culture such as drunkenness, slavery, gambling, and polygamy. Bradley, along with many other missionaries, viewed Western culture as superior to that of Thailand. At the time of his death, Bradley's evangelistic work had directly contributed to the conversion of only one person. Medical work thumb Much of the money made by Bradley during his time in Siam was from performing medical services for the Siamese and missionaries. Bradley was perceived as a \\"great American doctor\\" and had immediate credibility among the Siamese. Bradley challenged many of the old medical practices of the country, especially women lying by fire after pregnancy for a month, and wrote multiple books on these topics so that native doctors could learn of Western medical practices. Bradley is credited with performing the first surgery in Siam, removing a cancerous tumor from the body of a slave. After this surgery, Bradley became highly sought after for medical advice from the royal court. The royal court gained trust in Bradley and called on him for medical advice for years. Bradley taught royal doctors how to perform the same practices as he did and he wrote numerous books for the purposes of the court. Bradley's greatest medical challenge while in Siam was attempting to produce a vaccination for the smallpox virus, which devastated the country and killed Bradley's eight-month-old daughter, Harriet. Bradley received trial vaccines from Boston, none of which were successful. Bradley solved this problem by using the inoculation technique. (The inoculation technique was documented as having a mortality rate of only one in a thousand. Two years after Dr Peter Kennedy's description appeared, March 1718, Dr. Charles Maitland successfully inoculated the five-year-old son of the British ambassador to the Turkish court under orders from the ambassador's wife Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Four years later he introduced the practice to England.) Seeing the success that Bradley had with the technique, the royal court called on Bradley to vaccinate their children as well as many natives and slaves. Royal ties During his time in Siam, Bradley was almost always associated with the royal family. Prince Chutamani, the younger brother of Prince Mongkut, had urged Bradley to visit the kingdom in order to convince women of the kingdom that the practice of lying by fire after childbirth was harmful to their health. Due to his popularity, Bradley was asked to visit the Queen of Siam. Upon entering the throne room and taking a seat, Chutamani sat on the same level as Bradley, signifying equality. Shortly after this visit, Prince Chutamani requested the medical services of Bradley to care for the ailing Prince Mongkut. When Bradley's treatment healed Mongkut, a friendship was born between the two. While the medical attention given by Bradley linked him with the royal family for the remainder of his life, it was not until 1835, when Bradley brought a Siamese printing press to Siam from Singapore, that their relationship truly flourished. thumb At royal request, Bradley printed the Opium Edict in 1839,\\"From one of the letters, we quote the following on the subject of opium. 'His majesty has lately issued a new edict against the introduction and use of opium in this kingdom, and requested the use of our press to print it. We have printed at his expense, and according to his request, 10,000 copies. The immediate cause of this new edict was the following. Three large boats or proas loaded with opium from Singapore, armed and containing about 30 Chinamen each, were heard to be selling it at out places on the Gulf. The Siamese hearing this sent to take them; the smugglers fired upon the Siamese, who returned the fire, and killed 7 men, and took one of the boats. On investigating the matter, the king found a great number of his subjects were connected in purchasing opium. About the same time a number of junks recently from China had full cargoes of opium. Officers were sent into every town and village to investigate the subject. His majesty issued his edict, in which he offered pardon to those who had opium, on condition they would deliver it up to be burned, and threatened death to all who should hereafter either buy or use it. For nearly two months, his officers have been scouring the country, and numbers have been thrown into prison for endeavoring to secrete the drug. The king seems determined to free His country of this drug, at all hazards. We pity the poor creatures who have been accustomed to use it, but cannot but rejoice at the prospect of the removal of so great an evil. His majesty, however, has permitted a very small quantity to be restored to those who cannot break off the use of it immediately, but gives them to understand, that when it is gone they are to have no more for ever. Two or three ships from Singapore, &c.; happening to come up at the time having, as was said, opium were obliged to secrete it and take it back. The opium business is not yet completed; new discoveries are daily made, and for a number of days past, it is said the burning of the precious drug has gone on at a great rate.'\\" source: The Chinese repository . ‚Äî Vol. VIII. [May 1839 ‚Äì April 1840>. ‚Äî S. 384.] which marked the beginning of printing public documents in Siam. Mongkut took a strong interest in the printing press and after he took a visit to London, Bradley and Mongkut made the first copyright transaction in the history of Siam in 1862, a travel journal of Mongkut‚Äôs visit. With royal approval, Bradley founded the first newspaper in Siam, The Bangkok Recorder which was published monthly from 1844-1845 and 1865-1867. He also printed the annual almanac, The Bangkok Calendar, from 1859 till his death. Perhaps one of the most overlooked outcomes from Bradley's relationship with royalty is the change that took place in the educational system. Mongkut valued education highly and Bradley created boarding schools for native children to learn in a Western educational setting. The boarding schools, while unsuccessful, showed the emphasis put on education in Siam during this period. Bradley advised the royal court to pursue education until his death. As an advocate of education, Bradley had high regard for Anna Leonowens, the teacher of Mongkut's children. Bradley admired the perseverance of Leonowens even though she was not treated with respect from the Siamese. Bradley did admit, however, that Leonowens did not have a significant impact on Siam, an opinion at odds with hers which she recorded in her two volumes of memoirs beginning with The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870), later fictionalized in Margaret Landon's novel Anna and the King of Siam (1944). Other contributions Besides bringing the printing press to Siam, starting the first newspaper, and writing many books, Bradley is credited with translating the Old Testament into Siamese. Bradley was an advocate for Siam's equality and translated French policies into Siamese. Death and legacy Bradley died on 23 June 1873. He is remembered in Thailand for introducing vaccination, Western medicine, and the printing press to Thailand, as well as stressing Siamese equality and a better education system. He is buried in the Bangkok Protestant Cemetery. In 1981, Bangkok Christian Hospital began construction on a new 13-story edifice named in Bradley's honor: Mo ( ) Bradley Building ().

The London Gazette (March 1898), p. 1611 War with the United States When tensions between the United States and the Kingdom of Spain escalated during the spring of 1898, Admiral Bermejo was confident that the Spanish Navy was capable enough to defeat the U.S. Navy. For Spain's war strategy, Bermejo proposed a blockade of the American East Coast and an attack on Key West, Florida. Rear Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete, a friend of his,Keenan (2001), p. 72 pointed out the absurdity of such a plan, stating the Spain did not have the ability carry it out and that the American fleet was much more formidable than theirs. Bermejo continued to remain optimistic nonetheless, and on April 23, he led a meeting of Spanish naval officers to discuss the situation.

However, at that point Cervera's squadron did not have enough coal to make the return trip, and Bermejo's replacement as naval minister later countermanded that order, telling the rear admiral to remain at the harbor of Santiago de Cuba.

As a member of the Rochester Red Wings, Minnesota's Triple-A farm club, Liriano was awarded the 2005 International League Rookie of the Year. He led all minor league pitchers in strikeouts that year, with 204. He made his major league debut in relief on September 5, 2005, against the Texas Rangers. He later joined the Twins' starting rotation and won his first game on September 30, 2005, against the Detroit Tigers. Liriano started the 2006 season in Minnesota's bullpen, but was promoted to the starting rotation in May, exchanging positions with struggling starter Carlos Silva. He won each of his first three starts. 2006 Liriano made a 12‚Äì3 start to the 2006 season and won the American League Rookie of the Month awards for June and July. He was named by American League manager Ozzie Guill√©n as one of five candidates for the 2006 All-Star Final Vote and finished second to the player he was traded for, A. J. Pierzynski. Guill√©n selected Liriano for his first All-Star game to replace fatigued starting pitcher Jos√© Contreras. Liriano led the Major Leagues with a 2.19 ERA, statistics putting him in discussion for both the American League Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards, but a trip to the disabled list on August 11 left him with too few innings to qualify as the league's official ERA leader and jeopardized his chances at any such awards in 2006. On August 1, 2006, Liriano was scratched from his scheduled August 2 start because of forearm inflammation after a bullpen session. He missed one start before resuming bullpen work without pain, but was placed on the disabled list after continued arm pain during his last start on August 7, 2006. Liriano began a rehabilitation program on August 22, and threw off a mound for the first time on August 30, throwing only his fastball and changeup, and said that he would like to pitch his breaking ball later that week. He made a rehab start for the Rochester Red Wings on September 9, throwing 40 pitches for four strikeouts and one walk in three shutout, hitless innings. After the game, he reported feeling no pain in his elbow and was reactivated by the Twins. On November 6, 2006, Liriano underwent Tommy John surgery to curtail the pain in his left elbow. He missed the entire 2007 season. 2008 Twins in 2008. On April 11, 2008, he was recalled from Triple-A Rochester in the place of injured pitcher Kevin Slowey. Liriano made his season debut and his first game since Tommy John surgery on April 13, against the Royals. He pitched 4.2 innings giving up six hits, four earned runs and walking five while picking up a loss. On April 25, Liriano was sent back to the minors after a rough start to the season coming off Tommy John surgery. In three starts, he compiled an 0‚Äì3 record with an 11.32 ERA. After recording an ERA of 2.67 and going 10‚Äì0 in his 11 most recent minor league starts, the Twins recalled Liriano on August 1, from Triple-A Rochester Red Wings, replacing Liv√°n Hern√°ndez in the rotation. Hernandez was designated for assignment. In his first start after being recalled, Liriano pitched six scoreless innings and struck out five, recording the win. He then went 3‚Äì0 in his first three starts with a 1.45 ERA and 15 strikeouts in innings. 2009 Liriano posted a less than stellar 5‚Äì13 record in 2009, with a combined ERA of 5.80. However, this was his first year since his Tommy John surgery that he had spent that entire year on the Twins major league roster. On June 28 against the St. Louis Cardinals, he threw seven strong innings, only surrendering two runs. On August 12 vs Kansas City, Liriano went another seven innings, only allowing one Royals player to score a run in yet another strong outing. Between those strong flashes of brilliance though, he logged several sub-par showings, frequently giving up several runs during short times on the mound. 2010 During the 2009 offseason, Liriano returned to his native Dominican Republic to play winter baseball, playing for Leones del Escogido. He helped his club earn a postseason berth and then went 3‚Äì1 with a 0.49 ERA in seven playoff starts, while recording 47 strikeouts and five walks in 37 innings, as Leones del Escogido won the league championship. Liriano reported to spring training lighter than usual, and Twins coaches expressed guarded optimism that he had regained some of his 2006 form.Winter reports were true about Twins' Francisco Liriano The Twins considered using him as a closer to replace the injured Joe Nathan, but instead he was named to the starting rotation. Liriano got off to a fast start. In his first four 2010 starts for the Twins, he posted a 3‚Äì0 W-L record, 0.93 ERA with 27 strikeouts. On May 3, he was named the American League Pitcher of the Month for April, after posting a 3‚Äì0 record and leading the league with a 0.96 ERA. Through May 18, he had posted a 4‚Äì2 record and a 2.63 ERA in seven starts, striking out 46 in 48 innings and not giving up a single home run. He struggled from mid-May until the All-Star break, losing five of seven decisions. But after the break, he returned to his early season form. Over an eleven start stretch from July 16 (his first game after the All-Star break) to September 14, Liriano posted an 8‚Äì0 record to go along with a 2.41 ERA. Across this span, he limited hitters to a .227 batting average, struck out 72 in 71 innings against 25 walks, and gave up only two home runs. Liriano struggled in his final three starts of the season, however, losing all three outings and posting an ERA of 8.10. Liriano finished 2010 fifth in the AL in strikeouts with 201, while walking 58. He posted a 14‚Äì10 record for the year with a 3.62 ERA and a career-high innings pitched across 31 starts, 20 of which were quality. He was considered a Cy Young candidate by some writers, as his 2.66 FIP (a defense independent pitching statistic) was second only to Cliff Lee in the American League, and his 2.95 xFIP was first in the American League. Despite his ERA only ranking 14th in the league, Liriano posted an extremely low FIP primarily due to his ability to limit home runs. Liriano only allowed nine across the entire regular season (three of which came in his final start) and his HR/9 rate of 0.42 led the American League (which was also the lowest rate posted by a Twins starter in over 20 years). He was further benefited by his high strikeout totals, as his K/9 ratio of 9.44 ranked second in the AL behind Jon Lester and he was one of only five AL pitchers that year with at least 200 strikeouts. Liriano started Game 1 of the 2010 American League Division Series for the Twins. He received a no-decision, pitching 5 and innings, while giving up 6 hits and 3 walks, striking out 7, and allowing 4 runs, all earned. The Twins lost Game 1 to the New York Yankees, 6‚Äì4, and were swept 3 games to none in the series, marking the end of Liriano's season. Liriano finished tied for eleventh in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award alongside Justin Verlander, receiving one fifth-place vote. He also signed a 1-year contract after the season. 2011 Liriano struggled through his first several starts of 2011, giving up 24 earned runs in 23.2 innings through the Month of April. During this period of 5 starts, he only entered the 7th inning once. He met with his pitching coach and manager after these starts and was in danger of losing his spot in the starting rotation. His fortunes changed significantly in his next start. On May 3, Liriano pitched his first career complete game, a 1‚Äì0 no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field. The no-hitter featured 6 walks, a high (although not record-high) number for a no-hit game. He struck out 2 of the 30 batters he faced and threw 123 pitches, 66 of which were strikes. It was the first no-hitter for the Twins organization since Eric Milton accomplished the feat on September 11, 1999, against the Anaheim Angels, and the seventh official no-hitter for the franchise. After the no-hitter, Liriano made several strong appearances, including an exceptional start on June 12 against the Texas Rangers. He retired the first 19 batters in order and didn't give up a hit until the 8th inning. Liriano's performance faded later in 2011. After an exceptional outing against the New York Yankees, he left his next start on August 25 after just two innings. He made his way to the disabled list with shoulder strain and did not start another game for the rest of the year. He finished the season with a record of 9‚Äì10 and an ERA of 5.09. 2012 Liriano pitched a four- strikeout inning in the fourth inning of the Twins' game against the Kansas City Royals on June 5, 2012. On July 13, he struck out 15 batters in a loss to the Oakland Athletics, topping his career high of 12 strikeouts. He caused 27 swing and misses, the highest number since 2007. In 22 games (17 starts) with the Twins in 2012 before he was traded, Liriano went 3‚Äì10 with a 5.31 ERA and 109 strikeouts. =Chicago White Sox= On July 28, 2012, Liriano was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Eduardo Escobar and Pedro Hern√°ndez. As Liriano struggled with the command of his pitches, the White Sox removed him from the rotation in September. In 12 games (11 starts) with the White Sox, he went 3‚Äì2 with a 5.40 ERA. =Pittsburgh Pirates= 2013 Liriano agreed to a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates on December 21, 2012. The contract was voided shortly after as he suffered an injury to his non-throwing arm and failed his physical, having broken his non-throwing arm while he tried to scare his kids at Christmas. A new two-year deal was reached between the Pirates and Liriano and became official on February 8, 2013. He started the 2013 season on the Pirates's 15-day disabled list. He made his debut on May 11 against the New York Mets. Liriano's improved command by changing his pitching mechanics led to a career rebirth with Pittsburgh. He finished his 2013 campaign with a record of 16‚Äì8, an ERA of 3.02, and 163 strikeouts. In the Pirates' first playoff game in 21 years, Liriano gave up one run and four hits in 7.0 innings while earning the win as the Pirates defeated the Reds 6‚Äì2 in the NL Wild Card game. He thus became the first Pirates pitcher to win a postseason game since Tim Wakefield in 1992, as well as the first pitcher to win a postseason game at PNC Park. Liriano was named the 2013 NL Comeback Player of the Year for his bounce back year. 2014 Liriano struggled greatly in the first half of the season, going 1‚Äì7 with a 4.72 ERA in 15 starts at the All Star break. However, he reclaimed his dominance of 2013 in the second half of the season, going 6‚Äì3 with a 2.20 ERA in 14 starts to end the season. Overall, Liriano posted another strong season in 2014, going 7‚Äì10 with a 3.38 ERA and 175 strikeouts in 29 starts. On December 9, 2014, he re-signed with the Pirates on a 3-year, $39MM contract. 2015 Liriano continued his success from his previous seasons, striking out a career high 205 and going 12‚Äì7 for the Pirates. He led major league pitchers in lowest contact percentage (67.5%).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2015 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Plate Discipline Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball He also had the lowest zone percentage of all major league pitchers, with only 35.8% of his pitches being in the strike zone.Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2015 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Plate Discipline Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball 2016 Liriano was named Opening Day starter for the Pirates for the third successive year. However, he struggled throughout the season with bouts of wildness. In 21 starts with the Pirates, he pitched to a 6‚Äì11 record, 5.46 ERA, 116 strikeouts and 69 walks through 113 innings. =Toronto Blue Jays= On August 1, 2016, the Pirates traded Liriano along with Reese McGuire and Harold Ram√≠rez to the Toronto Blue Jays for Drew Hutchison. While it was initially believed that Liriano would replace Aaron Sanchez in the rotation due to the organization's desire to limit Sanchez's workload, general manager Ross Atkins announced on August 4 that the Blue Jays would use a six-man rotation going forward. Liriano made his debut with the Blue Jays on August 5, pitching six innings against the Kansas City Royals and yielding two earned runs in a 4‚Äì3 win. He made eight starts and two relief appearances with the Blue Jays in the regular season, and posted a 2‚Äì2 record, 2.92 ERA, and 52 strikeouts in 49 innings. In 2016 between the two teams he had the highest rate of bases on balls per 9 innings pitched in the majors (4.69).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2016 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Dashboard  FanGraphs Baseball In the Wild Card game, Liriano entered in relief in the 10th inning and retired all 5 of the batters he faced. He took the win after Edwin Encarnaci√≥n's walk-off home run in the eleventh inning. During the eighth inning in the second game of the ALDS, Rangers outfielder Carlos G√≥mez hit a 102-mph line drive single that struck Liriano near the back of the head. He was taken to a local hospital for examination, and cleared to return to Toronto with his teammates. On June 25, 2017, Liriano earned the 100th win of his career in an 8‚Äì2 victory over the Kansas City Royals. =Houston Astros= On July 31, 2017, the Blue Jays traded Liriano to the Houston Astros for Nori Aoki and Teoscar Hern√°ndez. Liriano was moved from the rotation to the bullpen following his acquisition. He made 20 appearances out of the bullpen and finished with an 0‚Äì2 record with a 4.40 ERA. Overall in 2017, Liriano made 38 appearances (18 starts) with a 6‚Äì7 record and a 5.66 ERA. The Astros finished the year with a 101‚Äì61 record (first in AL West), and eventually won the 2017 World Series. =Detroit Tigers= On February 23, 2018, Liriano signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Tigers.Detroit Tigers sign Francisco Liriano to one-year deal He earned a spot in the Tigers starting rotation, and won his Tiger debut in a 6‚Äì1 decision over the Kansas City Royals on April 2. Liriano was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a hamstring strain following a May 26 start against the Chicago White Sox. He was recalled on June 23 and made a start against the Cleveland Indians. On August 30, 2018, Liriano gave up Giancarlo Stanton's 300th home run. Liriano made 26 starts for the 2018 Tigers, compiling a 5‚Äì12 record, 4.58 ERA, and 110 strikeouts in innings. =Return to Pittsburgh= On February 4, 2019, Liriano agreed to a one-year minor league deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic first reported the deal and it was later confirmed to be worth $1.5 million with an additional $1 million in incentives. On March 23, 2019, the Pirates announced that Liriano had made the opening day roster. He was used exclusively as a relief pitcher during the season, posting a 5‚Äì3 record with a 3.47 ERA and 63 strikeouts in 70 innings. =Philadelphia Phillies= On January 22, 2020, Liriano signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28540073/phillies-add-francisco- liriano-bud-norris-drew-storen-neil-walker-minors-deals He was released on July 18.https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/francisco-liriano-let- go-by-phillies/ On August 2, 2020, Liriano opted out of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although he had ‚Äúmultiple guaranteed offers‚Äù on the table. Pitching style As of 2012, Liriano is a four-pitch pitcher. To left-handed hitters he throws a four-seam fastball, a two-seam fastball (both averaging about 93 mph), and a slider (mid 80s). Against right-handers, he adds a mid-80s changeup. More than half of his pitches with 2 strikes are sliders, perhaps due to the relatively high whiff rate ‚Äî 43% over his career. He has one of the league's highest whiff rates on a slider with 2 strikes. Liriano has been a strikeout pitcher throughout his career, averaging better than one strikeout per inning through the end of the 2019 season. Personal life Liriano's arrival in the United States for 2008 spring training was delayed due to visa problems caused by a prior drunk driving arrest in 2006. Francisco and Johanna Liriano became parents to Kevin Liriano on April 4, 2008. Liriano is the first cousin of pitcher Santiago Casilla.

It has a ZIP Code of 15212, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 1 (North Central Neighborhoods). The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire houses 32 Engine and 32 Truck in Deutschtown. History In 1783, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania established a 3000-acre tract of land north of where the Allegheny River merged with the Ohio River. John Redick created an initial town plan for Allegheny City ‚Äì which featured 36 city blocks surrounded by a common grazing area ‚Äì the following year. The common grazing area became a park now known as Allegheny Commons, and the area just east of the park ‚Äì which had been set aside for farming in Redick's initial plan ‚Äì is today's East Allegheny. This area was developed between 1850 and 1900 by immigrants who were almost exclusively German. As a result, the area was called Dutchtown, a mispronunciation of Deutschtown. Its residents created a business district on East Ohio Street and a residential district running south of it, from Cedar Street (on the western border with Allegheny Commons) to Troy Hill (on the east). These buildings were very solidly built. In 1984, this area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Deutschtown Historic District. The nominating petition noted that \\"Dutchtown is distinguished from neighboring North Side neighborhoods by its ethnic associations and intense feeling of neighborhood solidarity. It also retains the busiest original commercial district left on the North Side since the development of Allegheny Center in the 1960s.\\" The area is also a City of Pittsburgh Historic District. Construction of Interstate 279 sliced the neighborhood in half, such that there is now a West Deutschtown (which runs from Allegheny Commons to the Interstate and contains the active business district on East Ohio Street) and an East Deutschtown (which runs from the Interstate to Troy Hill). Both sections of the neighborhood suffered as a result of the Interstate's construction: some residents moved, their homes were rented by absentee landlords to low-income tenants, and the area saw a general lack of investment. However, neighborhood activists established the East Allegheny Community Council and gradually restored the neighborhood, especially the western portion. Geography and transportation East Allegheny is composed of \\"East Deutschtown,\\" an area that is bounded by East Street, East Ohio Street, Goehring Street and Vinial Streets, and \\"West Deutschtown,\\" which extends from Cedar Avenue to East Street and from the Norfolk Southern Mainline to Dunloe Street. Surrounding neighborhoods include Allegheny Center, Fineview, Troy Hill, Spring Hill, and Spring Garden. City buses that connect East Allegheny and downtown include the 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, and the 54a and 54b, which also connects East Allegheny with Oakland, the city's academic center. City Steps The East Allegheny neighborhood has four distinct flights of city steps - all of which are open and in a safe condition. In East Allegheny, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel through this densely populated area. Organization The neighborhood citizens group is the East Allegheny Community Council. The organization offers a self-guided walking tour for the neighborhood (available from its website).

The club were members of the Scottish Football League from 1890 until 1915 and folded in 1920. Abercorn were founder members of the Scottish Football League, but eventually could not compete with local rivals St Mirren. During their time in the SFL the club played at Underwood Park, Old Ralston Park and New Ralston Park. Their colours were blue and white stripes. History Abercorn F.C. was formed on 10 November 1877 with an initial membership of 200, a few months after St Mirren had been formed in the town with their first game been played in December against the 79th Highland Reserve Volunteers with the match ending in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Robert Fulton the president of the club getting the first goal and gate receipts of ¬£3. In June 1878 at a meeting at the Star Hotel in Paisley were the representatives from Abercorn, Arthurlie, Barrhead, Barrhead Rangers, Barrhead Thistle, Bridge of Weir, Caledonia (Thornliebank), Cartvale, Clydevale (Greenock), Glenkilloch, Johnstone Athletic, Jordanhill, Levern, Linwood, Mearns Pollock, Thornliebank, 17th Renfrewshire Rifle Volunteers and 23rd Renfrewshire Rifle Volunteers. At the meeting these clubs became the founder members of Renfrewshire County Football Association and a cup was purchased a year later from Summerton Jewellers of Paisley. Abercorn would win the Renfrewshire County Cup on five occasions. In 1887 they managed to make their first semi-final of the Scottish Cup, losing out to Cambuslang by a 10‚Äì1 scoreline, which is a joint record margin of defeat for the semi- final stage of the Scottish Cup. They would repeat the achievement of reaching the cup semi-finals in each of their next two seasons. In 1890 the club became founder members of the Scottish Football League, alongside Cambuslang, Celtic, Cowlairs, Dumbarton, Heart of Midlothian, Rangers, Renton, Saint Mirren, Third Lanark and Vale of Leven. The club finished the inaugural season of the league in seventh place out of ten, but had the satisfaction of finishing ahead of St Mirren, who ended in eighth place. This success was short-lived, however, as when a Second Division was created in 1893, Abercorn and Clyde who had been voted off the Scottish League First Division became founder members along with Greenock Morton, Hibernian, Motherwell, Northern, Partick Thistle, Port Glasgow Athletic and Thistle (Glasgow) In 1895‚Äì96 the club won Division Two, earning promotion back to Division One after a ballot. However, they finished bottom of Division One the following season, and were relegated back to Division Two. Abercorn won the Second Division championship in 1908‚Äì09, but were not promoted to Division One. They also failed to be elected to Division One after finishing as runners-up in 1911‚Äì12. The following season the club won the Scottish Qualifying Cup; during their run in this competition the club got its record attendance when 7,000 spectators attended the semi-final match with Nithsdale Wanderers. The club dropped out of the Scottish Football League in 1915, when the Second Division went into abeyance. They played in the Western League from 1915‚Äì16 until 1919‚Äì20, when their lease on their New Ralston ground was ended at the behest of the local town council. This was ostensibly in order to build an Ice Rink, which did not happen for another four years. It was long accused that St Mirren had used their connections with Paisley Town Council to kill off their rival. Unable to secure another ground within the town, this effectively spelled the end of Abercorn. Despite not being entered in any league competition they played one game in season 1920‚Äì21 with effectively a scratch team in a Scottish Cup defeat away to Vale of Leven. Around 2,000 spectators witnessed the last game that Abercorn played, which resulted in an 8‚Äì2 victory for Vale of Leven. Abercorn retained membership of the Scottish Football Association until 29 March 1922, when they were disbarred for failing to secure their own private home ground. Effectively though the club were defunct in 1920 when it played its last game, although an annual Abercorn Football Club dinner was still held in the town until 1939 just before the outbreak of World War II. In season 2009‚Äì10, 90 years after the original club disappeared, a new club was formed under the Abercorn name in Paisley.Abercorn FC ‚Äì back from the dead! Daily Record, 6 December 2010 The new club has had a marked lack of success, however. In its inaugural 18-game season, it lost all its matches. Ground Their home matches were initially played at East Park on the corner of Seedhill Road and Mill Street, before moving onto Blackstoun Park in Well Street in 1879. In 1889 they moved 200 yards to Underwood Park, where they remained until an 1899 move to Old Ralston Park in East Lane in the Williamsburgh area of Paisley which was 700 yards from their first ground at East Park. In 1909 the club moved to a site directly to the west of Old Ralston Park; New Ralston Park.

The security environment around Japan has become increasingly severe as represented by nuclear and missile development by North Korea. Transnational threats grounded on technological progress including international terrorism and cyber attacks are also increasing their significance. In the current world, no nation can maintain its own peace and security alone. Japan, including its Self Defense Forces, has contributed to the maximum extent possible to the efforts to maintain and restore international peace and security, such as the UN peacekeeping operations. Building on the ongoing efforts as a peaceful state, the Government of Japan has been making various efforts on its security policy which include: the establishment of the National Security Council (NSC), the adoption of the National Security Strategy (NSS), and the National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG). These efforts are made based on the belief that Japan, as a \\"Proactive Contributor to Peace\\", needs to contribute more actively to the peace and stability of the region and the international community, while coordinating with other countries including its ally, the United States. On December 4, 2013, the National Security Council was established, with the aim of establishing a forum which will undertake strategic discussions under the Prime Minister on a regular basis and as necessary on various national security issues and exercising a strong political leadership.  National Security Strategy (NSS)  On December 17. 2013, National Security Strategy was adopted by Cabinet decision.

The village is situated on the A38 between Droitwich Spa and Bromsgrove, and by Junction 5 of the M5 motorway. The first records of Wychbold suggest that it was of great importance to the Anglo-Saxons, particularly in regards to its proximity to Droitwich Spa. The village is known primarily for the garden centre Webbs of Wychbold. Toponymy The name Wychbold is derived from the Old English wƒ´c‚Äìbold, meaning \\"Dwelling near the trading settlement\\". It has been recorded as Uuicbold (692) and Wicelbold (1086, Domesday Book). The \\"wych\\" element (\\"near the trading settlement\\") is likely to refer to Droitwich. History =Iron Age to Roman times= Evidence has been found of human settlement in Wychbold from the Iron Age and Roman times. Various pits, ditches and postholes have been found in sites throughout the village, indicating the presence of roundhouses and a permanent Iron Age settlement. Archaeologists have also found various significant items from the Iron Age, such as broken vessels and a salt container from the Malvern Hills and Droitwich Spa. The presence of pottery from Malvern suggests that Wychbold had strong trade links outside of its immediate area, even in the Iron Age. Wychbold is located on an old Roman road and salt road, now the A38. Romans are believed to have settled in the Wychbold area between the 1st and 4th century, shown by the presence of Severn Valley and samian pottery. =Middle Ages to Early modern period= The earliest known record of Wychbold is in a charter of 692 (where it is known as Uuicbold), describing how √Üthelred of Mercia \\"granted ten hides of land there to his thegn Oslaf\\". The charter is generally considered to be fabricated, but describes the village as being \\"distinguished\\", suggesting that the village belonged to royalty at the time. The next known record of Wychbold is in a charter issued by Coenwulf of Mercia in 815. In this, and a later charter issued by Wiglaf of Mercia in 831, Wychbold is referred to as a royal vill, suggesting its importance as a royal base or even residence. Documents point to the existence of the Anglo‚ÄìSaxon estate within Wychbold, but its location is currently unknown. During the 11th century, possession of Wychbold passed from Earl Godwine to Osbern fitzRichard, who held it at the time of the Domesday Book. There were 11 hides (4 of which were exempt from tax), 5 mills and 26 salt‚Äìpans in the village. The population was around 50 people. In 1204, William de Cantilupe, Sheriff of Worcestershire and steward to King John, came into possession of properties within the village. During the Middle Ages, a manor house was built in Wychbold, north of Church Lane. Now known as Wychbold Court, the current timber-frame house dates back to the 16th or 17th century. Minor alterations have been made to the house, during the 19th and 20th centuries. Excavation near the Grade II listed house revealed pottery dating to the 13th or 14th century and evidence of farming in the area at the time. There also once stood a manor house called Wychbold Hall within the village, the residence of the Amphlett family, described as being \\"modern\\" in 1911. It was in \\"perfect preservation\\" when it stood. The stone-flagged floor of the house was moved to Greyfriars, Worcester. =20th Century= Home Guard during the Second World War During the Second World War, communal air raid shelters were built on either end of Wychbold, along with a concrete blast shelter near the main road. The village's Home Guard worked out of the Crown Inn. Governance Wychbold is primarily governed by Dodderhill Parish Council, which performs maintenance on the village's public areas. It is then governed by Wychavon District Council. It falls within the Mid Worcestershire constituency, being represented in Parliament by Nigel Huddleston. Wychbold falls under Ombersley division within Worcestershire County Council and is represented by Peter Tomlinson. Geography and demography Wychbold is located between the towns of Droitwich Spa and Bromsgrove. The River Salwarpe runs around the outside of the village. Nearby villages include Upton Warren and Stoke Prior to the north-east, and Rashwood to the south-west. The Droitwich transmitting station is located just outside the village, near Upton Warren. At the 2011 UK census, Wychbold had a population of 1,366 in 586 dwellings. 16.9% of the population were under the age of 16 and 11.1% were aged 75 and over. The White British ethnic group made up 93.1% of the population. In recent years, Wychbold has seen the development of multiple housing estates, such as the Elmbridge Gardens site built in 2014. The increase in population put pressure on the village's school, with rising demand for admissions places forcing the school to expand. Plans for further housing developments have been criticised, citing pressures on local infrastructure. Economy and transport Wychbold has several restaurants and pubs, including a Harvester and a McDonald's. Holiday Inn runs a hotel within the village, next to the motorway junction. There are also multiple petrol stations within the village, along the A38. Webbs of Wychbold, a garden centre, is located just outside of Wychbold, and hires large numbers of staff from the local area. It is known for the number of events it puts on throughout the year, such as their Christmas ice rink, which bring visitors to the village. There is also a Hobbycraft and Cotswold Outdoor within the garden centre. The A38 runs through Wychbold, connecting it to Droitwich Spa and Bromsgrove. The village is by Junction 5 of the M5 motorway, allowing easy travel to Worcester and Birmingham. Wychbold's bus service, the 144, is run by FirstGroup and goes between Worcester and Birmingham. Both Droitwich Spa and Bromsgrove have train stations, providing services to Hereford and Birmingham. Places of worship Wychbold's parish church is the church of St Mary de Wyche, located within the Anglican Diocese of Worcester. The Grade II* listed church was built between 1888-9, funded by the Amphlett family and John Corbett, an industrialist and the local Member of Parliament. The southeast tower contains an original late 13th century doorway. There also stood a Congregational church within the village, dating from 1836. Services and education Wychbold's surgery on De Wyche Road is run as a branch by St Johns Surgery as part of NHS Redditch and Bromsgrove. The village's closest A&E; is Worcestershire Royal Hospital, although there are non-urgent hospitals within Droitwich Spa and Bromsgrove. Other emergency services are provided by West Mercia Police and Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service, both having stations in Droitwich Spa. Wychbold's only school is Wychbold First and Nursery School, which opened in September 1972. It teaches children from the age of 3‚Äì10. Leisure and sport In August 2018, a new play area opened opposite Wychbold Village Hall, containing new swings, climbing frames and slides. The play area will be improved further in the future, adding a small games area for table tennis and boules. The village hall also maintains football pitches, with access to changing rooms and a car park. Wychbold also has a rural walk site called Centurion Way Woods. After the sudden closure of the village's social club in April 2017, Wychbold's villagers raised over ¬£20,000 to reopen the club. The Wychbold Sports and Social Club reopened in July 2017, with the aim to \\"bring the community together amidst several new housing developments\\" within the village. It offers a large lounge and function room, small bar and a snooker room. Wychbold is represented in Sunday league football by Wychbold FC, who have played on the pitches outside the village hall for over 50 years.

It is a direct clone of the 1982 Sega arcade game Pengo, even down to calling the enemies \\"snow bees,\\" as in the original. Gameplay The player takes the role of a penguin named Pengi who finds himself in a maze made up of ice blocks that is surrounded by an electric fence. If the blocks are kicked, they will slide along until they hit another block or the fence. If however, the block is already touching something else (in the direction it would slide), it breaks and disappears. As in Pengo, three of the blocks are marked with diamonds and cannot break. Acorn Electron level 1, showing 3 green Snow Bees, one of which has just been crushed. The maze is inhabited by deadly \\"snow bees\\". They move in a semi-random way: a bee may sometimes choose to get away from Pengi instead of chasing him (especially on early levels). The bees can be killed by crushing them with a moving ice block (bees do not stop the blocks so more than one bee can be killed with one kick) or by kicking the fence while they are touching it. This momentarily stuns them and they can be crushed by simply walking over them. Only a set number of bees are on the screen at once (e.g. 3 on level 1) but there are more (a total of 6 on level 1) which emerge from the diamond blocks as others are killed. A level is completed either by killing all of the bees or by lining up the special diamond blocks. This is the preferred way of completing the level because a huge points bonus is awarded (5,000 if they are touching the fence, 10,000 if they are not). The game continues with different coloured bees in a new maze. The number of bees on screen, the number of \\"reserve\\" bees, the speed of the bees and the intelligence of the bees all increase on each successive level, making it much more difficult to successfully line up the diamond blocks.

Edward Thompson was born at Marlborough, Wiltshire on 25 June 1881. He was the son of an assistant master at Marlborough College. He was educated at Marlborough before taking the Mechanical Science Tripos at Pembroke College, Cambridge, earning a third class degree. Thompson's academic background contrasts with that of his predecessor Nigel Gresley, who had also attended Marlborough, but then gained practical experience as a pupil at Horwich Works.  Career  =NER, GNR, LNER= After graduation Thompson worked in both industry and the railways for a while. By 1910 he was assistant divisional locomotive superintendent on the North Eastern Railway (NER), in which capacity he gave evidence at the inquiry into the fatal accident between two goods trains at Darlington on 15 November 1910. In 1912 he was appointed Carriage and Wagon Superintendent for the Great Northern Railway (GNR). He served with the Armed Forces during WW1, and was twice mentioned in dispatches. Upon demobilization, he returned to the railways, alternating between the wagon works at Darlington and Doncaster (and consequently between the North Eastern and Great Northern respectively). He became Workshop Manager at Stratford Works in 1930. Had Grouping not taken place in 1923, Thompson would have effectively become CME of the North Eastern in 1933 upon the retirement of A.C Stamer, who had been Assistant CME to Raven at the North Eastern. Works Manager at Stratford was Thompson's final post before becoming Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1941 after the death of Nigel Gresley. Thompson was to hold the CME post for 5 years. History shows that Gresley and Thompson disagreed on a number of matters. Thompson had a number of incidents with Gresley, and given the previous heated debate between Gresley and Thompson's father-in-law, Sir Vincent Raven, it is probable that there was a degree of petulance about Thompson's choice for his prototype A1/1 engine, namely No.4470 Great Northern, both for its name (that of NER rival company the GNR) and for it being Gresley's first Pacific, though opinion on this is heavily divided. Another incident is noted by O.S. Nock that Gresley reprimanded Thompson for interfering in the actions of a driver on an engine which had failed in service. The biggest dispute between them was on the Gresley conjugated valve gear for 3-cylinder engines. This valve gear arrangement worked well during peacetime but experienced problems due to poor maintenance during the Second World War, giving Thompson some justification for his criticism of the design. Gresley's passing was very unexpected, and the LNER had no immediate successor in mind. The LNER board of directors first requested permission from the Southern Railway to approach their CME, O.V.S. Bulleid, who had been Gresley's assistant until joining the Southern four years previously. Permission was granted, but he declined the offer. J.F. Harrison, the man later largely responsible for the design of No.71000 \\"Duke of Gloucester\\", was the popular choice. However, at 42 years old, it was considered inappropriate for someone so young to take the post. The LNER board then turned to Arthur Peppercorn for the CME role, but Thompson held seniority amongst other LNER officials and used this political experience to sidestep Peppercorn and take the title of CME. =Temperament= According to Col. H.C.B Rogers (who in turn cites a number of the LNER Engineers, Harrison, Smedley, Spencer et al), Thompson possessed an ill temper towards his colleagues and was notoriously difficult to deal with. The Drawing Office at Doncaster had full height panelling on the walls of the corridors, to which Thompson had full-length windows fitted, so that he could see all that was going on and what people were doing. Those who did not agree with him did not work with him for long. He possessed a strong dislike of his predecessor, and changed a lot of Gresley designs to his own ideas, many of which lacked foundation, and in a balanced environment would not have been considered acceptable. He was a quietly-spoken man, but was extremely sensitive about it, and became infamous for losing his temper should anyone ask him to repeat himself. He was largely intolerant of anyone who questioned his ideas, which seemed to be an insecurity caused by his time working under Gresley. Thompson was a regular visitor to Gresley with suggested initiatives, but was often rebuffed in front of the workforce because Gresley thought that many of his proposals were not feasible. In time, Thompson was to take these rebuffs from Gresley and dish them back to his team with ever-greater severity. A number of Gresley's assistants, such as Spencer, to name one, were dispatched to areas of the LNER considered as backwaters in comparison to Doncaster and Darlington. Men found him notoriously difficult to work with, but the women in his workforce often seemed to be able to get around him. He had an uncanny ability to charm those he wanted to or needed to, but he could also upset matters very quickly too. J.F. Harrison reported that meetings dealing with the railway unions would often have to be repeated after Thompson had left the room, in order to smooth ruffled feathers. His appearance was always immaculate, and his office stationery was all gold plated, a perceived symbol of his wealth. He was said to own a great many suits, shirts and ties, and prided himself on not having a hair out of place. In Sir Vincent Raven: North Eastern Railway Locomotive Engineer, Terry L Price writes that Thompson's wife Guen died in 1938, and he was subsequently very lonely after her passing. =Standardisation programme= When Thompson was appointed CME of the LNER he started a much needed standardisation programme. This programme demonstrated Thompson's dislike for Gresley's engineering practices. Many notable Gresley designs were rebuilt under this practice including the P2 Mikado, V2 Prairie and A1 Pacific locomotives. The A1 chosen for rebuilding was Great Northern, which was the original Gresley prototype for the class. The standardisation was a further reflection on the difference between Gresley and Thompson. The LNER had never been in a position to undergo large-scale re-equipment programmes such as those afforded by the LMS, and for much of its existence, the LNER used a large fleet of pre-grouping locomotives for everything except the very top-flight services. As such, Gresley believed that rebuilding and improving was usually enough in a lot of cases, and where it was not, he designed a locomotive specifically for the job. Examples of each are the D16/3 Claud Hamiltons (rebuilt), the B12/3 (re-boilered and new valve gear) and his K4 (built for the West Highland Line) and P2 (for the Aberdeen to Edinburgh route). Thompson, having spent a time introducing a conveyor system into the stores at York and Doncaster, was an advocate of a small variety of classes, and spent time during his tenure as CME in developing a list of classes either rebuilt to his standard (like the B2, A2/2, K1/1 etc.) or built new to standard designs (the B1, L1 etc.). The standardisation centred largely around the B1 boiler, which had been developed from that on the B17, 20\\" cylinders (a layover from the original A1 class's outside cylinders/K2 Cylinders, but with 10\\" piston valves), and a range of standard wheel sizes (among them 5'8\\", 6'2\\" and 6'8\\"). A number of intermediate 4-6-0 classes, such as the B16, B17 and GCR types, were rebuilt into outside-cylindered classes, where wheel size was the only major varying detail. The programme had the desired effect of reducing the variety of LNER classes, and allowed the withdrawal of a number of worn-out pre-grouping classes, but a good many of the rebuilds and in fact the new builds had design flaws, so that the problems Thompson solved for the Maintenance Dept. were replaced by new ones for the Operating Dept. =Thompson's designs= ;Pacific rebuilds Thompson criticised many of Gresley's practices, but equivalent comment can be made about many of Thompson's designs. Upon taking up his post, Thompson tried to convince the LNER hierarchy of the need to rebuild the Gresley Pacific and Mikado classes. The Directors of the LNER, having witnessed a Gresley A4 take the World Speed Record for steam, were sceptical about this, so Thompson researched as many middle big-end bearing failures on the LNER as he could find, attributing them to the design of the conjugated motion, even garnering outside opinion from the LMS. Despite roundly criticizing the Gresley motion, his Pacific rebuilds were not the best designs. They retained three cylinders, but with divided drive and 3 independent sets of Walschaerts valve gear. Thompson attached great importance to having the connecting rods equal in length, which was in fact unnecessary. As a result, the outside cylinders were placed behind the front bogie with the inside cylinder well forward. This gave the engine an unnecessarily long wheelbase, created long exhaust channels, generated vibration and encouraged flexing and fracture of the locomotive frames. All of his Pacifics were particularly prone to wheel slip owing to the high power output of the engine in relation to the adhesion factor. The engines were effective, and the design had materially less maintenance demand on the centre valve gear than the conjugated locomotives, but the positives were outweighed by the problems, which were of such significance that Thompson's engines were withdrawn and scrapped before many of their Gresley-designed forerunners. The Thompson Pacifics were ultimately more maintenance-intensive overall than the Gresley engines. Thompson omitted the \\"banjo dome\\" that had featured on the Gresley Pacifics since 1928. However, Thompson's successor, Arthur Peppercorn, revived the feature on the remaining batches of LNER Pacifics. From a technical standpoint, a number of the features of the Thompson design were not considered as acceptable or reasoned principles, as they did not follow established locomotive consideration. Divided drive, although it did reduce the total stress/strain on the centre crank axle, did not lend itself to frame integrity, especially coupled with connecting rods of equal length, as the greatest point of rigidity in the frame structure itself, the cylinders, were no longer lined up. Locomotive frames are flexible to handle side-to-side twist, and even axial twist along their length, but fore-and-aft motion between the frames leads to bearing and joint failures. To maintain connecting rods of equal length required the inside cylinder to be placed as far forward as possible, and even so the outside cylinders were behind the rear axle of the front bogie, which was not LNER practice, and subsequently resulted in a very long wheelbase. The front bogie itself was common with that on the B1, but was not sufficiently strong to control yawing of the Pacific classes, nor to straighten the engine out after a curve, and the Thompson A2's all had a poor reputation for being unwieldy, especially for rolling and yawing. However, the steam circuit, which was based on that from the P2's and the A4's, was generally regarded as excellent, as were the 19\\" cylinders fitted to the later A2/3's: consequently, with their large boilers, the Thompson Pacifics had a reputation for being capable of very high speeds, often being able to hold speeds in excess of 90 mph. The steam circuit aspects of the engines were carried over into the Peppercorn designs. ;Class L1 Thompson's class L1 Adriatic suburban tank locomotives were another unsuccessful design. They were powerful machines that should have been well-suited to their duties but their 5 ft 2 inch wheels were too small for fast outer suburban services and they quickly knocked themselves apart. The axle boxes suffered, water tanks split, oil pipes broke off, and crossheads wore rapidly. ;Class B1 On the other hand, Thompson built one of the most successful LNER designs, the class B1 4-6-0, which was a simple two-cylinder design mixed traffic engine. The B1 was based loosely on Gresley's class B17. The prototype for the B1 was a B17/1 modified with a higher pressure boiler and with its centre cylinder removed. The design proved to be free-steaming, economical and simple to maintain, though some details caused issues in due course. The small amount of balancing of the reciprocating masses (in order to reduce hammer-blow) made for a rough ride and a significant degree of vibration in the cab, and eventually the reciprocating mass percentage was increased. More than 400 B1s were built between 1946 and 1952: British Railways continued B1 production after nationalisation. The Diagram 100A boiler used in the class formed the basis for the rebuilding of many pre-grouping classes, including the class O4 2-8-0 freight locos. The Thompson B1 equalled the LMS Black Five locomotives during the inter-regional exchange trials in the first year of British Railways. The B1 was also cheaper to build than the Black Five. The B1 had poor and very inconsistent ride quality, unlike the relatively smooth riding qualities of a number of Gresley designs, though it must be considered that fundamentally a locomotive with a rear truck/Cartazzi arrangement does generally ride better than one without, and even Gresley's classes reflected this. Poor riding remains a characteristic of the two preserved B1s. ;Other Rebuilds Thompson also rebuilt a number of different Gresley locomotives, usually using the B1-derived boiler (in turn developed from the B17 type boiler) and 2 20\\" cylinders (derived from the early Gresley A1 engines). The Robinson 8K (LNER O4) was re-boilered and re-cylindered to create the class O1. Two B17's were rebuilt with 2 cylinders to create the prototypes for the B1 class, and later more B17s were converted. A K4 became the prototype K1/1 and a K3 became the K5. The K1/1 was a particularly unpopular engine: its name MacCailin Mor was not a good choice for the locality in which it worked, and after having its 3 cylinders replaced with 2, its performance endeared it even less to the local Scottish crews. ;Coach design Thompson improved passenger safety by introducing steel-bodied coaches to the LNER. Previously the LNER had Gresley-designed coaches, the most famous of which had teak bodies but by 1940s standards these were considered insufficiently safe in a collision. Therefore, during the Second World War Thompson designed new all-steel coaches that became a forerunner of British Railways Mark 1 design. ;Proposed Pacific Shortly before Thompson's retirement the LNER was short of express passenger locomotives so Thompson initiated plans for a new Pacific design, which he intended to be based on the rebuilt Great Northern. However the LNER design office, having received reports of Great Northern's performance in service, delayed completing the design of the locomotive until Thompson had retired. Even then Thompson laid down a strict set of guidelines for the new locos. The new class (LNER Class A1) was finally designed under Thompson's successor Arthur Peppercorn, who disregarded almost all of Thompson's guidelines. =Locomotive list= *Thompson A1/1 *Thompson A2/1 *Thompson A2/2 *Thompson A2/3 *Thompson B1 *Thompson B2 *Thompson K1 *Thompson K5 *Thompson L1 *Thompson O1 Family Thompson was the son-in-law of Sir Vincent Raven, the final CME of the NER.

The station broadcasts a variety of music formats according to the tastes of the volunteer DJs doing the shows. The only restriction that KTEQ places on the formats of the shows is that the music cannot be Top 40 music. The station was off the air for nearly 13 1/2 years following the loss of its Non-commercial educational broadcast license but returned to air on March 8, 2014. Besides broadcasting over-the-air, the station's programming is also transmitted over channel 6 of the cable television system on the SDSM&T; campus and through Internet streaming. History =WCAT (1922-1952)= The first campus radio station at SDSM&T; was WCAT, which broadcast from September 1922 to 1952. The AM station was founded by students from the Electrical Engineering department. The station was licensed to broadcast at a wavelength of 485 meters at a power of 750 watts. Later, the station operated on 1200 kilohertz at a power of 100 watts. The station's call-letters, WCAT, were an abbreviation for \\"Wildcat Radio.\\" Originally, the studios were located in the basement of the Administration building. In 1928, the studios were moved to the third floor of the Prep Building (later used as the school's gymnasium and currently the Music Center). During the time that WCAT was on the air, the AM station's programming ranged from news to sports and music. In 1952, WCAT was forced to leave the airwaves as a result of pressure from a commercial radio station. =KTEQ (1971-Present)= Efforts to launch a new SDSM&T; campus radio station started in 1969. With the assistance of announcer Greg Carey, student body president Jim McGibbney formed the Tech Educational Radio Council (TERC), the governing body of KTEQ. The first studio of KTEQ was located at Surbeck Center; and, tower space for the transmitter was originally donated by KBHE- FM. Initially, KTEQ-FM broadcast at 88.1 MHz with a power of 10 watts. The first broadcast by KTEQ-FM occurred on August 7, 1971, opening with \\"Also sprach Zarathustra.\\" The first voice to be heard on KTEQ was that of Gary Brown. KTEQ-FM first broadcast recorded on a cassette in the Connolly Hall dormitory. \\"Spotty\\" quality in places with some dropouts. US senator and then- US presidential candidate George McGovern gave KTEQ an on-air interview during the 1972 election. The studios of KTEQ were eventually relocated at the Old Gym building on the SDSM&T; campus. In the early 1980s while still broadcasting at 88.1 MHz, the FCC granted KTEQ permission to increase its radiated power. After the power increase, cable TV subscribers near the broadcast tower complained to their cable provider of KTEQ signal bleeding into their TV programs. Rather than upgrading the shielding of their cable, the cable TV provider chose to grant KTEQ money to change their broadcast frequency so as to not interfere with TV audio signal. In the summer of 1982, KTEQ moved from 88.1 to 91.3 which is farther away from the TV frequency spectrum. KTEQ radio broadcasts fell silent for a number of months during the mid-1980s. The station finally resumed broadcasts during the spring of 1987. At that time, the station broadcast twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. Later, the station removed all of the 3AM-to-6AM time slots from its schedule. For many years, the station's tower space was donated by KOTA-TV. In August 2000, KOTA increased its effective radiated power. As a result, KTEQ had to remove its transmitting hardware from the KOTA tower space, ending KTEQ's radio broadcasts. When KTEQ failed to resume its broadcasts within a year, the station lost its broadcast license in September 2001. New broadcasting hardware was purchased, but the FCC stopped accepting applications for non-commercial broadcast licenses in 2001. While KTEQ waited for the FCC to resume accepting non-commercial license applications, the station continued to transmit its programming over the Internet and over the closed-circuit television on the SDSM&T; campus. By 2005, a new studio was located at Surbeck Center. In May 2011, the campus radio station's long wait finally appeared to be over. On May 3, 2011, SDSM&T; was informed by the FCC that the university had beat out four other applicants for a non-profit radio license. The FCC awarded the radio station a construction permit to put up a new transmitter as well as a three-year timeline in which to re-establish the station. The station's management and TERC board hoped to have the station fully up and running on their own tower by the Fall of 2013. KTEQ encountered many delays, but construction was finally completed in the Spring of 2014. The FCC issued the Station a new Non-Commercial Educational Radio Broadcast License on February 28, 2014.

The first few Markov numbers are :1, 2, 5, 13, 29, 34, 89, 169, 194, 233, 433, 610, 985, 1325, ... appearing as coordinates of the Markov triples :(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 13), (2, 5, 29), (1, 13, 34), (1, 34, 89), (2, 29, 169), (5, 13, 194), (1, 89, 233), (5, 29, 433), (1, 233, 610), (2, 169, 985), (13, 34, 1325), etc. There are infinitely many Markov numbers and Markov triples.  Markov tree  There are two simple ways to obtain a new Markov triple from an old one (x, y, z). First, one may permute the 3 numbers x,y,z, so in particular one can normalize the triples so that x ‚â§ y ‚â§ z. Second, if (x, y, z) is a Markov triple then by Vieta jumping so is (x, y, 3xy ‚àí z). Applying this operation twice returns the same triple one started with. Joining each normalized Markov triple to the 1, 2, or 3 normalized triples one can obtain from this gives a graph starting from (1,1,1) as in the diagram. This graph is connected; in other words every Markov triple can be connected to (1,1,1) by a sequence of these operations.Cassels (1957) p.28 If we start, as an example, with (1, 5, 13) we get its three neighbors (5, 13, 194), (1, 13, 34) and (1, 2, 5) in the Markov tree if z is set to 1, 5 and 13, respectively. For instance, starting with (1, 1, 2) and trading y and z before each iteration of the transform lists Markov triples with Fibonacci numbers. Starting with that same triplet and trading x and z before each iteration gives the triples with Pell numbers. All the Markov numbers on the regions adjacent to 2's region are odd-indexed Pell numbers (or numbers n such that 2n2 ‚àí 1 is a square, ), and all the Markov numbers on the regions adjacent to 1's region are odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers (). Thus, there are infinitely many Markov triples of the form :(1, F_{2n - 1}, F_{2n + 1}),\\\\, where Fx is the xth Fibonacci number. Likewise, there are infinitely many Markov triples of the form :(2, P_{2n - 1}, P_{2n + 1}),\\\\, where Px is the xth Pell number. lists Markov numbers that appear in solutions where one of the other two terms is 5. Other properties Aside from the two smallest singular triples (1,1,1) and (1,1,2), every Markov triple consists of three distinct integers.Cassels (1957) p.27 The unicity conjecture states that for a given Markov number c, there is exactly one normalized solution having c as its largest element: proofs of this conjecture have been claimed but none seems to be correct.Guy (2004) p.263 Odd Markov numbers are 1 more than multiples of 4, while even Markov numbers are 2 more than multiples of 32. In his 1982 paper, Don Zagier conjectured that the nth Markov number is asymptotically given by :m_n = \\\\tfrac13 e^{C\\\\sqrt{n}+o(1)} \\\\quad\\\\text{with } C = 2.3523414972 \\\\ldots. Moreover, he pointed out that x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz +4/9, an approximation of the original Diophantine equation, is equivalent to f(x)+f(y)=f(z) with f(t) = arcosh(3t/2). The conjecture was proved by Greg McShane and Igor Rivin in 1995 using techniques from hyperbolic geometry. The nth Lagrange number can be calculated from the nth Markov number with the formula :L_n = \\\\sqrt{9 - {4 \\\\over {m_n}^2}}.\\\\, The Markov numbers are sums of (non-unique) pairs of squares. Markov's theorem showed that if :f(x,y) = ax^2+bxy+cy^2 is an indefinite binary quadratic form with real coefficients and discriminant D = b^2-4ac, then there are integers x, y for which f takes a nonzero value of absolute value at most :\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt D}{3} unless f is a Markov form:Cassels (1957) p.39 a constant times a form :px^2+(3p-2a)xy+(b-3a)y^2 such that :\\\\begin{cases} 0 where (p, q, r) is a Markov triple.

The decision expands upon the earlier decision in Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22 and first introduced the \\"alter ego\\" theory of corporate liability. Facts A ship owned by Lennard's Carrying Co was transporting some goods on a voyage from Novorossiysk to the Asiatic Petroleum Company, a joint venture of the Shell and Royal Dutch oil companies. The ship sank and the cargo was lost. The judge found that the director, Mr Lennard, did know or should have known about defects in the ship, which led its boiler to catch fire, and ultimately sink the ship. There was an exemption from liability in section 502 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, stating that a ship owner would not be liable for losses if an event happened without 'actual fault or privity'. Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd sued Mr Lennard's company for negligence under the Act. At issue was whether the guilty acts of a director would be imposed upon the corporation. Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd argued that it was not liable and could be exempt under section 502. Judgment The House of Lords held that liability could be imposed on a corporation for the acts of the directors because there is a rebuttable presumption the directors are the controlling minds of the company. Here Mr Lennard did not rebut the presumption. Viscount Haldane explained the \\"directing mind\\" principle of corporate liability: In considering the case of Mr Lennard himself he stated: Significance Prior to this case the primary means of imposing liability on a corporation was through vicarious liability, but that applied only to employees of the company, which excluded the directors. After the Lennard case, the alter ego theory has become the most powerful method of imposing liability on a corporation. It has proved to be particularly effective for imposing criminal liability.

Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Konkoly Observatory in 1940. The body's observation arc begins with its identification as at McDonald Observatory in 1950, or 2 years prior to its official discovery observation at Goethe Link.  Physical characteristics  Edmondson has been characterized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In November 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Edmondson was obtained from photometric observations at the Etscorn Campus Observatory () in New Mexico, United States. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.208 hours with a brightness variation of 0.29 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, Edmondson measures 21.94 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.102, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a more typical albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.08 and calculates a diameter of 20.51 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.8.  Naming  This minor planet was named for astronomer Frank K. Edmondson (1912‚Äì2008) of Indiana University, the program's founder and director. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 February 1971 ().

He has 30 years of prosecutorial experience and has led numerous investigations into serious, complex transnational crimes. He has been a senior public prosecutor since 1992 and has, over the course of his career, been responsible for prosecuting terrorism and organized crime cases. Most notably, he investigated the bombing on the discotheque La Belle in then West-Berlin in 1986, which claimed the life of two US soldiers and a Turkish woman, and uncovered the involvement of the Libyan intelligence service. He also proved the involvement of the terrorist Carlos and Syrian diplomats in the attack on the French culture centre Maison de France, also in West-Berlin, in 1983, as well as the involvement of Syrian intelligence services in the bombing of a German-Arab social center in Berlin in 1986. Since 1998, Mehlis has been the Chief of the Contact Office of the European Judicial Network and Coordinator for the fight against organized crime in the State of Berlin. In 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Mehlis as the Commissioner of the UN International Independent Investigation Commission (UNIIIC) into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 22 other persons in Beirut. In October 2005, Jund al-Sham threatened to slaughter Detlev Mehlis while he was heading the UN inquiry into the assassination of Rafik Hariri, claiming that Mehlis was connected with Israel and the CIA. Mehlis was head of the UNIIIC from 13 May 2005 to 11 January 2006. He issued two reports during his term. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon was not yet established when he was at this post. The first Mehlis report was presented to the Secretary General on 20 October 2005. It implicated Lebanese and Syrian Military Intelligence in the assassination, and it accused Syrian officials, including now Foreign Minister Muallem, of misleading the investigation. A second report, submitted on December 10, 2005, upholds the conclusions of the first report. On 11 January 2006 Mehlis, upon his own suggestion, was replaced by Serge Brammertz, who upheld UNIIIC's conclusions under Mehlis. An indictment was subsequently issued in 2011 by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon against persons with alleged ties to Hezbollah. A Russian magazine called Odnako challenged the entire UN investigation. In recognition of his achievements in the fight against terrorism Mehlis has been decorated with the German Bundesverdienstkreuz Erster Klasse (Order of Merit, First Class) and the French l'Ordre National de Merite. In 2009 Mehlis was appointed by the EU-Commission to head the \\"European Union Philippines Justice Support Programme\\" (EPJUST). The program aimed successfully to assist authorities and civil society alike in fighting extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in the Philippines.

The very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR), or high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), is a Generation IV reactor concept that uses a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor with a once- through uranium fuel cycle. The VHTR is a type of high-temperature reactor (HTR) that can conceptually have an outlet temperature of 1000 ¬∞C. The reactor core can be either a \\"prismatic block\\" (reminiscent of a conventional reactor core) or a \\"pebble-bed\\" core. The high temperatures enable applications such as process heat or hydrogen production via the thermochemical sulfur‚Äìiodine cycle.  Overview  AVR in Germany.The VHTR is a type of high-temperature reactor that conceptually can reach high outlet temperatures (up to 1000 ¬∞C); however, in practice the term \\"VHTR\\" is usually thought of as a gas-cooled reactor, and commonly used interchangeably with \\"HTGR\\" (high-temperature gas- cooled reactor). There are two main types of HTGRs: pebble bed reactors (PBR) and prismatic block reactors (PMR).The prismatic block reactor refers to a prismatic block core configuration, in which hexagonal graphite blocks are stacked to fit in a cylindrical pressure vessel. The pebble bed reactor (PBR) design consists of fuel in the form of pebbles, stacked together in a cylindrical pressure vessel, like a gum-ball machine. Both reactors may have the fuel stacked in an annulus region with a graphite center spire, depending on the design and desired reactor power.  History  The HTGR design was first proposed by the staff of the Power Pile Division of the Clinton Laboratories (known now as Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in 1947. Professor Rudolf Schulten in Germany also played a role in development during the 1950s. Peter Fortescue, whilst at General Atomic, was leader of the team responsible for the initial development of the High temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), as well as the Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) system. The Peach Bottom reactor in the United States was the first HTGR to produce electricity, and did so very successfully, with operation from 1966 through 1974 as a technology demonstrator. Fort St. Vrain Generating Station was one example of this design that operated as an HTGR from 1979 to 1989. Though the reactor was beset by some problems which led to its decommissioning due to economic factors, it served as proof of the HTGR concept in the United States (though no new commercial HTGRs have been developed there since).IAEA HTGR Knowledge Base HTGRs have also existed in the United Kingdom (the Dragon reactor) and Germany (AVR reactor and THTR-300), and currently exist in Japan (the High- temperature engineering test reactor using prismatic fuel with 30 MWth of capacity) and China (the HTR-10, a pebble-bed design with 10 MWe of generation). Two full-scale pebble-bed HTGRs, the HTR-PM reactors, each with 100 MW of electrical production capacity, are under construction in China as of 2019.  Nuclear reactor design  = Neutron moderator = The neutron moderator is graphite, although whether the reactor core is configured in graphite prismatic blocks or in graphite pebbles depends on the HTGR design. = Nuclear fuel = The fuel used in HTGRs is coated fuel particles, such as TRISO fuel particles. Coated fuel particles have fuel kernels, usually made of uranium dioxide, however, uranium carbide or uranium oxycarbide are also possibilities. Uranium oxycarbide combines uranium carbide with the uranium dioxide to reduce the oxygen stoichiometry. Less oxygen may lower the internal pressure in the TRISO particles caused by the formation of carbon monoxide, due to the oxidization of the porous carbon layer in the particle. The TRISO particles are either dispersed in a pebble for the pebble bed design or molded into compacts/rods that are then inserted into the hexagonal graphite blocks. The QUADRISO fuel concept conceived at Argonne National Laboratory has been used to better manage the excess of reactivity. = Coolant =  Helium  Helium has been the coolant used in most HTGRs to date, and the peak temperature and power depend on the reactor design. Helium is an inert gas, so it will generally not chemically react with any material. Additionally, exposing helium to neutron radiation does not make it radioactive, unlike most other possible coolants.  Molten salt  The molten salt cooled variant, the LS-VHTR, similar to the advanced high-temperature reactor (AHTR) design, uses a liquid fluoride salt for cooling in a pebble core. It shares many features with a standard VHTR design, but uses molten salt as a coolant instead of helium. The pebble fuel floats in the salt, and thus pebbles are injected into the coolant flow to be carried to the bottom of the pebble bed, and are removed from the top of the bed for recirculation. The LS-VHTR has many attractive features, including: the ability to work at high temperatures (the boiling point of most molten salts being considered are > 1,400 ¬∞C), low- pressure operation, high power density, better electric conversion efficiency than a helium-cooled VHTR operating at similar conditions, passive safety systems, and better retention of fission products in case an accident occurred. = Control = In the prismatic designs, control rods are inserted in holes cut in the graphite blocks that make up the core. The VHTR will be controlled like current PBMR designs if it utilizes a pebble bed core, the control rods will be inserted in the surrounding graphite reflector. Control can also be attained by adding pebbles containing neutron absorbers. =Materials challenges= The high-temperature, high-neutron dose, and, if using a molten salt coolant, the corrosive environment, of the VHTR require materials that exceed the limitations of current nuclear reactors. In a study of Generation IV reactors in general (of which there are numerous designs, including the VHTR), Murty and Charit suggest that materials that have high dimensional stability, either with or without stress, maintain their tensile strength, ductility, creep resistance, etc. after aging, and are corrosion resistant are primary candidates for use in VHTRs. Some materials suggested include nickel-base superalloys, silicon carbide, specific grades of graphite, high-chromium steels, and refractory alloys. Further research is being conducted at US national laboratories as to which specific issues must be addressed in the Generation IV VHTR prior to construction.  Safety features and other benefits  The design takes advantage of the inherent safety characteristics of a helium-cooled, graphite-moderated core with specific design optimizations. The graphite has large thermal inertia and the helium coolant is single phase, inert, and has no reactivity effects. The core is composed of graphite, has a high heat capacity and structural stability even at high temperatures. The fuel is coated uranium-oxycarbide which permits high burn-up (approaching 200 GWd/t) and retains fission products. The high average core-exit temperature of the VHTR (1,000 ¬∞C) permits emissions-free production of process heat. Reactor is designed for 60 years of service.http://www.uxc.com/smr/Library/Design%20Specific/HTR- PM/Papers/2006%20-%20Design%20aspects%20of%20the%20Chinese%20modular%20HTR- PM.pdf Page 489, Table 2.

The correct year of 1938 is confirmed from the UK General Register Office Records.)IMDb database is an English singer who released successful singles in the 1960s. Her most famous and successful song, \\"Bobby's Girl\\" (a cover of the Marcie Blane single), reached number three in the UK Singles Chart at Christmas time in 1962. It also reached number six in the Norwegian chart in that year. Career Maughan was born in Consett, County Durham. The sleeve notes on her 1963 album, written by John Franz, stated that > \\"Susan's family moved to Birmingham (in 1953) when Susan was 15. She started > work there as a shorthand typist, but all the time she scanned the musical > press to see if any band leaders needed a girl singer.

Her biggest break came in September > 1962 when she recorded 'Bobby's Girl'; her success brought so many offers > that in November 1963 Susan decided to branch out as a solo artist.\\" In early 1963, following the success of \\"Bobby's Girl\\", Maughan had further minor UK hits entitled \\"Hand A Handkerchief To Helen\\" and \\"She's New To You\\". Also at that time she released her first album on Philips called I Wanna Be Bobby's Girl But.... All songs on this album featured male names, including the John D. Loudermilk songs \\"Norman\\" and \\"James (Hold The Ladder Steady)\\" which were hits in the US for the American singer Sue Thompson. Thompson had a minor UK hit in 1965 with \\"Paper Tiger\\", and the songs were also covered in the UK by Carol Deene. John Franz's 1963 sleeve notes conclude: \\"Susan is one of the most conscientious artists in the entertainment industry ‚Äì never quite believing in her own triumphs but continually striving to improve her work in every detail. This hard work, coupled with her natural singing talent can only lead to greater achievements in the future.\\" She appeared at the 1963 Royal Variety Performance, and in the 1963 film What a Crazy World. Maughan also appeared in the film Pop Gear (1965) and sang the title song for the second Charles Vine low-budget superspy film, Where the Bullets Fly (1966). In 1971 she appeared in series five of the Morecambe & Wise BBC television series, having previously appeared on their 1962 ATV series. In that year she also replaced Clodagh Rodgers in the show at London's Adelphi Theatre, Meet Me in London, after Rodgers withdrew just before curtain up on the first night when one of her songs was cut. Late in rehearsals it had become clear the show was too long for one running twice-nightly. In 1974, she recorded the song, Time, from the film, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, which she sang during her appearance the same year on the Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club show.

Meiji reforms An 1868 photograph of Japanese Tokugawa Bakufu troops being trained by the French Military Mission to Japan. When Western powers began to use their superior military strength to press Japan for trade relations in the 1850s, the country's decentralized and antiquated military forces were unable to provide an effective defense against their advances. The fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867 led to the restoration of the Meiji Emperor and a remarkable period of national growth. De facto political and administrative power shifted to a group of younger samurai who had been instrumental in forming the new system and were committed to modernizing the military. They introduced drastic changes, which cleared the way for the development of modern, European-style armed forces. second French Military Mission to Japan, 1872alt=280x280px In an attempt to increase the number of soldiers the use of conscription became universal and obligatory in 1872 and, although samurai wedded to their traditional prerogatives resisted, by 1880 a conscript army was firmly established. The Imperial Army General Staff Office, created after the Prussian model of the Generalstab, was established directly under the emperor in 1878 and was given broad powers for military planning and strategy. The new force eventually made the samurai spirit its own. Loyalties formerly accorded to feudal lords were transferred to the state and the emperor. Upon release from service, soldiers carried these ideals back to their home communities, extending military-derived standards to all classes. Japan was dedicated to creating a unified, modern nation by the late nineteenth‚Äìcentury. Among their goals were to instill respect for the emperor, the requiring of universal education throughout the Japanese nation, and lastly the privilege and importance of military service. The Conscription Law established on January 10, 1873, made military service mandatory for all men in their twenties to enlist.Yasuma Takata and Gotaro Ogawa, Conscription System in Japan (New York: University of Oxford Press, 1921), 10. \\"In 1873, no one could predict with certainty whether these quarrels would end peacefully or through military action, nor was it clear which individuals or groups would come out on top in the expected power struggle.\\" This legislation was the most significant military reform of the Meiji era. The samurai class no longer held a monopoly on military power; their benefits and status were stripped from them after the Meiji Restoration. The dissolution of the samurai class would create a modern army of men of equal status. However, many of the samurai were unhappy with reforms and openly shared their concerns. The conscription law was a way of social control: placing the unruly samurai class back into their roles as warriors. The Japanese government intended that conscription would build a modern army capable of standing against the armies of Europe. However, the Meiji Restoration initially caused dissent among the dissolved samurai class, but the conscription system was a way of stabilizing that dissent. Some of the samurai, more disgruntled than the others, formed pockets of resistance to circumvent the mandatory military service. Many committed self-mutilation or openly rebelled (Satsuma Rebellion).Hyman Kublin, \\"The 'Modern' Army of Early Meiji Japan\\". The Far Eastern Quarterly 9, no. 1 (1949): 32. They expressed their displeasure, because rejecting Western culture \\"became a way of demonstrating one's commitment\\" to the ways of the earlier Tokugawa era.Jason G. Karlin, \\"The Gender of Nationalism: Competing Masculinities in Meiji Japan\\". Journal of Japanese Studies 28, no. 1 (2002): 42. The law also allowed the military to educate the enlisted. With the swing towards urbanization, the government was concerned about the population‚Äôs education lagging behind: Most commoners were illiterate and unknowing. The military provided \\"fresh opportunities for education\\" and career advancement.Hyman Kublin, \\"The 'Modern' Army of Early Meiji Japan\\". The Far Eastern Quarterly 9, no. 1 (1949): 46. The \\"raw recruits would, especially in the first years of conscription, learn how to read\\".E. Herbert Norman, Soldier and Peasant in Japan: The Origins of Conscription (Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1997), 46. The government realized that an educated soldier could become a productive member of society; education was for the betterment of the state. For men to serve in the army, they were required to submit to a medical examination. This conscription exam measured height, weight and included an inspection of the candidate's genitals. Those unable to pass the exam, the \\"congenitally weak, inveterately diseased, or deformed\\", were sent back to their families.Yasuma Takata and Gotaro Ogawa, Conscription System in Japan (New York: University of Oxford Press, 1921), 14. The exam \\"divided the citizenry into those who were fit for duty and those who were not\\".Teresa A. Algoso, \\"Not Suitable as a Man: Conscription, Masculinity, and Hermaphroditism in Early Twentieth-Century Japan\\". In Sabine Fruhstuck and Anne Walthall, eds., Recreating Japanese Men (University of California Press), 248. There was no material penalty for failing the exam, but those who were unable to serve could be marginalized by society. An imperial rescript of 1882 called for unquestioning loyalty to the emperor by the new armed forces and asserted that commands from superior officers were equivalent to commands from the emperor. Thenceforth, the military existed in an intimate and privileged relationship with the imperial institution. Top-ranking military leaders were given direct access to the emperor and the authority to transmit his pronouncements directly to the troops. The sympathetic relationship between conscripts and officers, particularly junior officers who were drawn mostly from the peasantry, tended to draw the military closer to the people. In time, most people came to look more for guidance in national matters to military commanders than to political leaders. The main concern of Japanese military modernization in the early 1900s focused on adopting the weaponry of the Western world. To do so Japan had to create a system where they could manufacture the technology themselves. This would cause the industrialization of Japan, called for by the leaders of the island country. Another strategy that Japan used to advance their position in the world would be to ally with European nations. Japan saw itself vulnerable to European powers, thus the country decided to ally with Great Britain in 1902. The alliance, named the Anglo-Japanese alliance, called for both nations to come to each others aid if a war with more than two additional nations broke out. Wars and other conflicts An illustration of Habalofsk occupied by Japanese troops during the Russian Civil War The first overseas test of the nation's new military capabilities was the Taiwan Expedition of 1874, which was in retaliation for the 1871 murder of shipwrecked Ry≈´ky≈´an sailors. It was followed by a series of victorious military ventures until World War II. Japan moved against Korea and China (First Sino-Japanese War), and Russia (Russo-Japanese War) to secure the raw materials and strategic territories it believed necessary for the development and protection of the homeland. Territorial gains were achieved in Korea, the southern half of Sakhalin (\\"Karafuto\\" in Japanese), and Manchuria. As an ally of Britain in World War I, Japan assumed control over Germany's possessions in Asia in the Treaty of Versailles, notably in China's Shandong Province, and the German-controlled Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall islands in the Pacific Ocean. During the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901) in China, the Japanese contingent was the largest among the Eight-Nation Alliance. The Russian Civil War led to Japanese intervention in Siberia to prop up the White Guard. The Naval General Staff, independent from the supreme command from 1893, became even more powerful after World War I. At the 1921‚Äì22 Washington Naval Conference, the major powers signed the Five Power Naval Disarmament Treaty, which set the international capital ship ratio for the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy at 5, 5, 3, 1.75, and 1.75, respectively. The Imperial Navy insisted that it required a ratio of seven ships for every eight United States naval ships but settled for three to five, a ratio acceptable to the Japanese public. The London Naval Treaty of 1930 brought about further reductions but, by the end of 1935, Japan had entered a period of unlimited military expansion and ignored its previous commitments. By the late 1930s, the proportion of Japanese to United States naval forces was 70.6 percent in total tonnage and 94 percent in aircraft carriers, and Japanese ships slightly outnumbered those of the United States.

Small, but wealthy, the Duchy took a modest part in the European colonization and settlement of West Africa and the Caribbean. History Like Brandenburg, that had far larger German colonising power before the formation of the German Empire, the Polish-Lithuanian fief of Courland had a European crusading, hence expansionist, past. The colonies were established under Jakob, Duke of Courland and Semigallia, and were indirect colonies of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During his reign (1642‚Äì1682), the Duchy established trading relations with all of the major European powers. Jakob established one of the largest merchant fleets in Europe, with its main harbours in Windau (today Ventspils), and Libau (today LiepƒÅja). His fleet made voyages to the West Indies as early as 1637 when the settlers established the first colony on Tobago. The first colony was a failure, but it was refounded in 1639. In 1651, the Duchy gained a colony in Africa on St. Andrew's Island in the Gambia River and went on to build Fort Jakob on the island. The Duchy also gained control of additional land, which happened to include St. Mary Island (modern day Banjul) and Fort Jillifree. The Duchy's colonies exported sugar, tobacco, coffee, cotton, ginger, indigo, rum, cocoa, tortoise shells, as well as tropical birds and their much sought after feathers. In the end, the Duchy would manage to retain control of these lands for less than a decade and the colonies were formally ceded to England in 1664. The colonies were lost when the Duchy's neighbours took advantage of its weakened defences during the Northern Wars, when Jakob was held captive by the Swedish Army from 1658 to 1660. However, after the end of the war the island of Tobago was returned to Courland. However, the Duchy ended up abandoning the island in 1666. In 1668, a Courish ship attempted to reoccupy Fort Jacob but was driven off by the Dutch garrison stationed on the island. The Courland Monument near Great Courland Bay commemorates the Duchy's settlements. A final Courish attempt to establish a Caribbean colony involved the construction of a settlement near modern Toco on Trinidad.Ko≈Çodziejczyk, Dariusz.

Hommel married Carolina Schultheiss (1869-1938), divorced of the painter Georg Schuster Woldan, in 1908. He became stepfather to her daughter, Eva van Hoboken (1905-1987), who took the name Eva Hommel.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 265‚Äì266. He studied at French academic painter Jean-Paul Laurens studio in Paris, in 1908. He returned to Germany the following year, joining the Munich Academy at 19 October 1909, where he studied painting with Hugo von Habermann, a leading name of the Munich Secession. He would be a member of the Munich Secession afterwards and their president. He became a teacher in 1928. He became famous during the Weimar Republic as a portrait painter, doing the portraits of Friedrich Ebert and Albert Einstein. After the Nazis took power in 1933, modern art was banned as Degenerate art, while Hommel's naturalist and realist style brought him the favour of the new regimen, which made him one of the official painters of Nazi Germany. His style, compared with other Nazi painters, such as Werner Peiner, seems more free from modern influences. Hommel was represented several times at the Great German Art Exhibitions that took place at the House of German Art, in Munich. In the 1937 exhibition, he showed several works, including portraits of Field Marshall August von Mackensen and Reich Minister Hjalmar Schacht. He was given the Lenbach Prize in 1936. In 1939, he became director of a painting class at the Berlin Academy of Art. He married Barbara von Kalckreuth the same year. He continued to be in favour of the leading names of the Nazi Germany, being commissioned two portraits of Adolf Hitler, in 1939 and 1940, including the famous The F√ºhrer at the Battlefield, which was massively reproduced. He also portrayed Heinrich Himmler and Hermann G√∂ring in a hunter outfit. He participated at the German Artists and the SS exhibitions that took place in Wroclaw and Salzburg in 1944. In the final stages of World War II, he was added to the Gottbegnadeten list of the most important artists to be kept from the war effort, in August 1944. After the war, he was accused of being a Nazi activist and beneficiary at a Denazification court, in Munich, on 9 July 1948, but the complaint was withdrawn after a month. He continued his career the following years, and did portraits of several economic leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany.

It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development. Although BDD is principally an idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight, the practice of BDD does assume the use of specialized software tools to support the development process. Although these tools are often developed specifically for use in BDD projects, they can be seen as specialized forms of the tooling that supports test-driven development. The tools serve to add automation to the ubiquitous language that is a central theme of BDD. BDD is largely facilitated through the use of a simple domain-specific language (DSL) using natural-language constructs (e.g., English-like sentences) that can express the behaviour and the expected outcomes. Test scripts have long been a popular application of DSLs with varying degrees of sophistication. BDD is considered an effective technical practice especially when the \\"problem space\\" of the business problem to solve is complex. History Behavior-driven development is an extension of test-driven development: development that makes use of a simple, domain-specific scripting language (DSL). These DSLs convert structured natural language statements into executable tests. The result is a closer relationship to acceptance criteria for a given function and the tests used to validate that functionality. As such it is a natural extension of TDD testing in general. BDD focuses on: * Where to start in the process * What to test and what not to test * How much to test in one go * What to call the tests * How to understand why a test fails At its heart, BDD is about rethinking the approach to unit testing and acceptance testing in order to avoid issues that naturally arise. For example, BDD suggests that unit test names be whole sentences starting with a conditional verb (\\"should\\" in English for example) and should be written in order of business value. Acceptance tests should be written using the standard agile framework of a user story: \\"As a [role] I want [feature] so that [benefit]\\". Acceptance criteria should be written in terms of scenarios and implemented as classes: Given [initial context], when [event occurs], then [ensure some outcomes] . Starting from this point, many people developed BDD frameworks over a period of years, finally framing it as a communication and collaboration framework for developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. During the \\"Agile specifications, BDD and Testing eXchange\\" in November 2009 in London, Dan NorthDan North: How to sell BDD to the business gave the following description of BDD: > BDD is a second-generation, outside-in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder, > multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology. It describes a cycle of > interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of > working, tested software that matters. During an interview with Dan North at GOTO Conference in 2013, Liz Keogh defines BDD as: > It's using examples to talk through how an application behaves... And having > conversations about those examples. GOTO 2013 ‚Ä¢ Interview with Liz Keogh & > Dan North https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5WpUJk8He4 Dan North created a BDD framework, JBehave, followed by a story-level BDD framework for Ruby called RBehaveD.North, Introducing RBehave which was later integrated into the RSpec project.S.Miller, InfoQ: RSpec incorporates RBehave He also worked with David Chelimsky, Aslak Helles√∏y and others to develop RSpec and also to write \\"The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends\\". The first story-based framework in RSpec was later replaced by Cucumber mainly developed by Aslak Helles√∏y. Capybara, which is a part of the Cucumber testing framework is one such web-based test automation software. Principles of BDD Test-driven development is a software-development methodology which essentially states that for each unit of software, a software developer must: * define a test set for the unit first; * make the tests fail; * then implement the unit; * finally verify that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed. This definition is rather non-specific in that it allows tests in terms of high-level software requirements, low-level technical details or anything in between. One way of looking at BDD therefore, is that it is a continued development of TDD which makes more specific choices than TDD. Behavior-driven development specifies that tests of any unit of software should be specified in terms of the desired behavior of the unit. Borrowing from agile software development the \\"desired behavior\\" in this case consists of the requirements set by the business -- that is, the desired behavior that has business value for whatever entity commissioned the software unit under construction. Within BDD practice, this is referred to as BDD being an \\"outside-in\\" activity. =Behavioral specifications= Following this fundamental choice, a second choice made by BDD relates to how the desired behavior should be specified. In this area BDD chooses to use a semi-formal format for behavioral specification which is borrowed from user story specifications from the field of object-oriented analysis and design. The scenario aspect of this format may be regarded as an application of Hoare logic to behavioral specification of software units using the Domain Language of the situation. BDD specifies that business analysts and developers should collaborate in this area and should specify behavior in terms of user stories, which are each explicitly written down in a dedicated document. Each User Story should, in some way, follow the following structure: ; Title: An explicit title. ; Narrative: A short introductory section with the following structure: :* As a: the person or role who will benefit from the feature; :* I want: the feature; :* so that: the benefit or value of the feature. ; Acceptance criteria:A description of each specific scenario of the narrative with the following structure: :*Given: the initial context at the beginning of the scenario, in one or more clauses; :*When: the event that triggers the scenario; :*Then: the expected outcome, in one or more clauses. BDD does not have any formal requirements for exactly how these user stories must be written down, but it does insist that each team using BDD come up with a simple, standardized format for writing down the user stories which includes the elements listed above. However, in 2007 Dan North suggested a template for a textual format which has found wide following in different BDD software tools. A very brief example of this format might look like this: Title: Returns and exchanges go to inventory. As a store owner, I want to add items back to inventory when they are returned or exchanged, so that I can track inventory. Scenario 1: Items returned for refund should be added to inventory. Given that a customer previously bought a black sweater from me and I have three black sweaters in inventory, when they return the black sweater for a refund, then I should have four black sweaters in inventory. Scenario 2: Exchanged items should be returned to inventory. Given that a customer previously bought a blue garment from me and I have two blue garments in inventory and three black garments in inventory, when they exchange the blue garment for a black garment, then I should have three blue garments in inventory and two black garments in inventory. The scenarios are ideally phrased declaratively rather than imperatively ‚Äî in the business language, with no reference to elements of the UI through which the interactions take place. This format is referred to as the Gherkin language, which has a syntax similar to the above example. The term Gherkin, however, is specific to the Cucumber, JBehave, Lettuce, behave and Behat software tools. =Specification as a ubiquitous language= Behavior-driven development borrows the concept of the ubiquitous language from domain driven design. A ubiquitous language is a (semi-)formal language that is shared by all members of a software development team -- both software developers and non-technical personnel. The language in question is both used and developed by all team members as a common means of discussing the domain of the software in question. In this way BDD becomes a vehicle for communication between all the different roles in a software project. A common risk with software development includes communication breakdowns between Developers and Business Stakeholders. BDD uses the specification of desired behavior as a ubiquitous language for the project Team members. This is the reason that BDD insists on a semi-formal language for behavioral specification: some formality is a requirement for being a ubiquitous language. In addition, having such a ubiquitous language creates a domain model of specifications, so that specifications may be reasoned about formally. This model is also the basis for the different BDD-supporting software tools that are available. The example given above establishes a user story for a software system under development. This user story identifies a stakeholder, a business effect and a business value. It also describes several scenarios, each with a precondition, trigger and expected outcome. Each of these parts is exactly identified by the more formal part of the language (the term Given might be considered a keyword, for example) and may therefore be processed in some way by a tool that understands the formal parts of the ubiquitous language. Most BDD applications use text-based DSLs and specification approaches. However, graphical modeling of integration scenarios has also been applied successfully in practice, e.g., for testing purposes. Specialized tooling support Much like test-driven design practice, behavior-driven development assumes the use of specialized support tooling in a project. BDD can be seen as a more specific version of TDD, as it requires to supply not only test code but a separate document in addition to describe the behavior in a more human-readable language. This requires a two-step process for executing the tests, reading and parsing the descriptions, and reading the test code and finding the corresponding test implementation to execute. This process makes BDD slightly more laborious to work with as a developer, but due to its human-readable nature the value of those documents extends to an even less technical audience, and can hence serve as a communication means for describing requirements (\\"features\\"). =Tooling principles= In principle a BDD support tool is a testing framework for software, much like the tools that support TDD. However, where TDD tools tend to be quite free-format in what is allowed for specifying tests, BDD tools are linked to the definition of the ubiquitous language discussed earlier. As discussed, the ubiquitous language allows business analysts to write down behavioral requirements in a way that will also be understood by developers. The principle of BDD support tooling is to make these same requirements documents directly executable as a collection of tests. If this cannot be achieved because of reasons related to the technical tool that enables the execution of the specifications, then either the style of writing the behavioral requirements must be altered or the tool must be changed. The exact implementation of behavioral requirements varies per tool, but agile practice has come up with the following general process: * The tooling reads a specification document. * The tooling directly understands completely formal parts of the ubiquitous language (such as the Given keyword in the example above). Based on this, the tool breaks each scenario up into meaningful clauses. * Each individual clause in a scenario is transformed into some sort of parameter for a test for the user story. This part requires project- specific work by the software developers. * The framework then executes the test for each scenario, with the parameters from that scenario. Dan North has developed a number of frameworks that support BDD (including JBehave and RBehave), whose operation is based on the template that he suggested for recording user stories. These tools use a textual description for use cases and several other tools (such as CBehave) have followed suit. However, this format is not required and so there are other tools that use other formats as well. For example, Fitnesse (which is built around decision tables), has also been used to roll out BDD. =Tooling examples= There are several different examples of BDD software tools in use in projects today, for different platforms and programming languages. Possibly the most well-known is JBehave, which was developed by Dan North, Elizabeth Keogh and several others. The following is an example taken from that project: Consider an implementation of the Game of Life. A domain expert (or business analyst) might want to specify what should happen when someone is setting up a starting configuration of the game grid. To do this, he might want to give an example of a number of steps taken by a person who is toggling cells. Skipping over the narrative part, he might do this by writing up the following scenario into a plain text document (which is the type of input document that JBehave reads): Given a 5 by 5 game When I toggle the cell at (3, 2) Then the grid should look like ..... ..... ..... ..X.. ..... When I toggle the cell at (3, 1) Then the grid should look like ..... ..... ..... ..X.. ..X.. When I toggle the cell at (3, 2) Then the grid should look like ..... ..... ..... ..... ..X.. The bold print is not part of the input; it is included here to show which words are recognized as formal language. JBehave recognizes the terms Given (as a precondition which defines the start of a scenario), When (as an event trigger) and Then (as a postcondition which must be verified as the outcome of the action that follows the trigger). Based on this, JBehave is capable of reading the text file containing the scenario and parsing it into clauses (a set-up clause and then three event triggers with verifiable conditions). JBehave then takes these clauses and passes them on to code that is capable of setting a test, responding to the event triggers and verifying the outcome. This code must be written by the developers in the project team (in Java, because that is the platform JBehave is based on). In this case, the code might look like this: private Game game; private StringRenderer renderer; @Given(\\"a $width by $height game\\") public void theGameIsRunning(int width, int height) { game = new Game(width, height); renderer = new StringRenderer(); game.setObserver(renderer); } @When(\\"I toggle the cell at ($column, $row)\\") public void iToggleTheCellAt(int column, int row) { game.toggleCellAt(column, row); } @Then(\\"the grid should look like $grid\\") public void theGridShouldLookLike(String grid) { assertThat(renderer.asString(), equalTo(grid)); } The code has a method for every type of clause in a scenario. JBehave will identify which method goes with which clause through the use of annotations and will call each method in order while running through the scenario. The text in each clause in the scenario is expected to match the template text given in the code for that clause (for example, a Given in a scenario is expected to be followed by a clause of the form \\"a X by Y game\\"). JBehave supports the matching of clauses to templates and has built- in support for picking terms out of the template and passing them to methods in the test code as parameters. The test code provides an implementation for each clause type in a scenario which interacts with the code that is being tested and performs a test based on the scenario. In this case: * The \`theGameIsRunning\` method reacts to a Given clause by setting up the initial game grid. * The \`iToggleTheCellAt\` method reacts to a When clause by firing off the toggle event described in the clause. * The \`theGridShouldLookLike\` method reacts to a Then clause by comparing the state of the game grid to the expected state from the scenario. The primary function of this code is to be a bridge between a text file with a story and the code being tested. Note that the test code has access to the code being tested (in this case an instance of \`Game\`) and is very simple in nature. The test code has to be simple, otherwise a developer would end up having to write tests for his tests. Finally, in order to run the tests, JBehave requires some plumbing code that identifies the text files which contain scenarios and which inject dependencies (like instances of \`Game\`) into the test code. This plumbing code is not illustrated here, since it is a technical requirement of JBehave and does not relate directly to the principle of BDD-style testing. Story versus specification A separate subcategory of behavior-driven development is formed by tools that use specifications as an input language rather than user stories. An example of this style is the RSpec tool that was also originally developed by Dan North. Specification tools don't use user stories as an input format for test scenarios but rather use functional specifications for units that are being tested. These specifications often have a more technical nature than user stories and are usually less convenient for communication with business personnel than are user stories. An example of a specification for a stack might look like this: Specification: Stack When a new stack is created Then it is empty When an element is added to the stack Then that element is at the top of the stack When a stack has N elements And element E is on top of the stack Then a pop operation returns E And the new size of the stack is N-1 Such a specification may exactly specify the behavior of the component being tested, but is less meaningful to a business user. As a result, specification- based testing is seen in BDD practice as a complement to story-based testing and operates at a lower level. Specification testing is often seen as a replacement for free-format unit testing. Specification testing tools like RSpec and JDave are somewhat different in nature from tools like JBehave. Since they are seen as alternatives to basic unit testing tools like JUnit, these tools tend to favor forgoing the separation of story and testing code and prefer embedding the specification directly in the test code instead. For example, an RSpec test for a hashtable might look like this: describe Hash do let(:hash) { Hash[:hello, 'world'] } it { expect(Hash.new).to eq({}) } it \\"hashes the correct information in a key\\" do expect(hash[:hello]).to eq('world') end it 'includes key' do hash.keys.include?(:hello).should be true end end This example shows a specification in readable language embedded in executable code. In this case a choice of the tool is to formalize the specification language into the language of the test code by adding methods named \`it\` and \`should\`. Also there is the concept of a specification precondition - the \`before\` section establishes the preconditions that the specification is based on. The result of test will be: Hash should eq {} includes key hashes the correct information in a key The Three Amigos The Three Amigos, also referred to as a \\"Specification Workshop\\", is a meeting where the Product Owner discusses the requirement in the form of Specification by Example with different stakeholders like the QA and development team. The key goal for this discussion is to trigger conversation and identify any missing specifications. The discussion also gives a platform for QA, development team and Product owner to converge and hear out each other's perspective to enrich the requirement and also make sure if they are building the right product. The three Amigos are * Business - Role of the Business user is to define the problem only (and not venture into suggesting any solution) * Development - Role of the Developers involve to suggest ways to fix the problem * Testing - Role of testers is to question the solution, bring up as many as different possibilities for brain storming through What-If scenarios and help make the solution more precise to fix the problem.

A large air pocket can be caused by several variables, such as excess egg white, unrested batter, or incorrect temperature. A canel√© () is a small French pastry flavored with rum and vanilla with a soft and tender custard center and a dark, thick caramelized crust. It takes the shape of a small, striated cylinder up to five centimeters in height with a depression at the top. A specialty of the Bordeaux region of France, today it is widely available in p√¢tisseries in France and abroad.  History  The canel√© is believed to originate from the Couvent des Annonciades, Bordeaux in either the 15th or the 18th century. The modern word \\"canel√©\\" originates in Gascon, which was spoken in Bordeaux and a large area of southwestern France until the 19th century. In Limoges, there was a food called canole, a bread made with flour and egg yolks, which may be the same item as that sold in Bordeaux since the 18th century under the name of canaule, also written canaul√© or canaulet. Artisans known as canauliers who specialized in baking them registered a Corporation (or guild) with the Parliament of Bordeaux in 1663, which allowed only them to produce several specific foods: Blessed bread, canaules, and Retortillons. Since they were not a part of the Pastry Corporation (Guild), which had a monopoly over baking with milk and sugar or mixtionn√©e dough, they were prohibited from using those ingredients. The canauliers disputed the Pastry Chefs' privileges and on 3 March 1755 the council of State in Versailles ruled for the canauliers and ended the Pastry Chefs' monopoly. An edict of 1767 limited the number of authorized canaulier shops in a city to eight. It created very strict requirements for joining the profession. Nevertheless, in 1785 there were at least 39 canaulier shops in Bordeaux, at least ten of which were in the district (faubourg) of Saint-Seurin. The French Revolution abolished all the Corporations, but later census rolls continue to show shops of Canauliers and bakers of \\"blessed bread\\". In the first quarter of the 20th century the canel√© reappeared, even if it is difficult to date exactly when. An unknown pastry chef re-popularised the antique recipe of canauliers. He added rum and vanilla to his dough. It is likely that its current shape comes from the similarity (in French) of the word wave with the word \\"cannelure\\" (fluting, corrugation, striations). The modern name \\"canel√©\\" is of recent origin. The Guide Gourmand de la France does not mention it. Only in 1985, after the pastry's popularity had begun to explode, was the Brotherhood of the Canel√© of Bordeaux (Confr√©rie du Canel√© de Bordeaux) created and the second \\"n\\" of its name removed. The name canel√© became a collective brand, registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property of France by the Brotherhood. Ten years after the registration of the brand, there were at least 800 manufacturers in Aquitaine and 600 in the Gironde. In 1992, Gironde alone consumed an estimated 4.5 million canel√©s.  Preparation and consumption  The canel√© is traditionally baked in a small cylindrical fluted mold. Traditionally the molds were brushed with beeswax, but today butter is used. Produced in numerous sizes, they can be consumed for breakfast, for snacks, and as a dessert depending in some measure on size. Canel√©s can be paired with red wine and many other beverages. Traditionally, \\"canel√©s\\" or \\"cannel√©s of Bordeaux\\" are generally sold in bunches of 8 or 16. In Paris, most of the famous shops such as Ladur√©e and Pierre Herm√© still spell it as \\"cannel√© of Bordeaux\\" with double 'n'.

They had long side tanks that came to the front of the smokebox, which sloped forwards to improve visibility and had a recess cut in to aid maintenance. Forty were built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) between 1913 and 1922, with a further 62 being added by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) between 1924 and 1939. They were given the nickname \\"Submarines\\" due to their long tanks. History For shunting and local goods work, the Great Northern Railway (GNR) had traditionally used saddle-tank engines of the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement; the last of these, of GNR Class J13, having been built in 1909 to the designs of H.A. Ivatt, the GNR Locomotive Superintendent. Nigel Gresley succeeded Ivatt in 1911, and soon identified a need for engines to work the short-haul coal traffic in the West Riding of Yorkshire; the nature of which required that the locomotives also be suitable for shunting. He designed a new class of 0-6-0 tank engine, using side tanks instead of saddle tanks. Gresley had recently begun the rebuilding of the GNR Class L1 0-8-2T locomotives with larger boilers, in diameter, which left a number of diameter boilers spare. Thirty of these were used in the construction of the new goods tank engines between 1913 and 1919; when ten more were built in 1922, these again used secondhand boilers, but in diameter. On the GNR, both varieties were classified J23, but the LNER divided them into J51 with smaller boilers, and J50 with larger boilers. The LNER continued the construction of Class J50, building a further 62 up to 1939, only the first ten of which were given secondhand boilers. Class J51 were rebuilt to class J50 between 1929 and 1935. J50/1 No. 68896 leading J50/3 No. 68975 at Harringay 9 April 1960. Each of the two main classes exhibited variations: locomotive brakes could be operated by vacuum or steam pressure; the driving position could be on the right- or the left-hand side of the cab; and there were three sizes of coal bunker. These variations were recognised by class subdivisions: *J51/1 10 built 1913‚Äì14, 4 ft 2 in boiler, vacuum brake, right-hand drive, short bunker *J51/2 20 built 1914‚Äì19, as J51/1 but long bunker *J50/1 10 rebuilt 1929‚Äì35 from J51/1 with 4 ft 5 in boiler *J50/2 20 built 1922‚Äì24, as J51/2 but 4 ft 5 in boiler, plus 20 rebuilt 1929‚Äì34 from J51/1 with 4 ft 5 in boiler *J50/3 38 built 1926‚Äì30, 4 ft 5 in boiler, steam brake, left-hand drive, long bunker *J50/4 14 built 1938‚Äì39, 4 ft 5 in boiler, vacuum brake, left-hand drive, long bunker with hopper All were built at Doncaster, except the last fourteen which were built at Gorton. Further orders were placed in 1939 and 1941 totalling 25 more locomotives, but these were cancelled in 1942 after a number of components had been manufactured. Numbering On the GNR, the numbers were 157‚Äì164, 166‚Äì176, 178, 211‚Äì230; these were increased by 3000 by the LNER. The first ten engines built by the LNER were numbered 3231‚Äì40, following on from the GNR engines; but those built from 1926 were given scattered numbers between 583 and 636, between 1037 and 1086, and 2789‚Äì94. In 1943, new numbers were allotted in a continuous block from 8890 to 8991; these numbers were applied between January and December 1946, but before this could be done, the oldest ten, nos. 3157‚Äì64/6/7 were temporarily renumbered 3180‚Äì9 in May and June 1945. They duly received their permanent numbers 8890‚Äì9 between June and December 1946. Under British Railways, the 1946 numbers were increased by 60000.

It was built in 1910 at what was at that time the east end of the city by Andrew Ross (original owner) who was a local Hamilton businessman. Originally, the arena had a seating capacity of 4,500 and standing room for roughly 500 people. By 1977 it had a seating capacity of 2800 people. It was torn down in 1977 when the ice-making equipment broke down and the city decided it would be cheaper to demolish the arena than replace the old machinery. A new and much larger arena, Copps Coliseum, was constructed six years later. Today, the Barton Street Arena site is occupied by residential housing. There were six entrances‚Äîthree on Barton, and three on Bristol Street. The north side of the arena (the Barton Street side) housed the coat-check and the ladies' washroom. The five dressing rooms were located on the Bristol Street side, as well as a \\"smoking room\\". The press box was also on the south side, above the stands. The building was steam heated so patrons could watch the game in comfort. The ice surface itself, at 200-feet by 80-feet, was lit by twenty-eight five-hundred-candle-power lights. After the first National Hockey League game was played in the arena between Hamilton and the Montreal Canadiens; Montreal owner George Kennedy commented: \\"This is a fine arena.

He is regarded as one of the greatest patriarchs of the Coptic Church. Benjamin guided the Coptic church through a period of turmoil in Egyptian history Atiya, Aziz S.. The Coptic Encyclopedia. New York:Macmillan Publishing Company, 1991. . that included the fall of Egypt to the Sassanid Empire, followed by Egypt's reconquest under the Byzantines, and finally the Arab Islamic Conquest in 642. After the Arab conquest Pope Benjamin, who was in exile, was allowed to return to Alexandria and resume the patriarchate. Early life He was born around 590 in Barsh√ºt, in the Beheira region of the western Nile Delta area. Comparatively little is known about his early life, other than that he came from a Coptic family of comfortable means. The proximity of his home to the capital city of Alexandria has led some to assume that he received some education there. No details on his family life are known, other than that he had one brother, Mennas. Mennas is known for having been tortured with fire and, eventually, being drowned in the Nile by the Byzantine Patriarch Cyrus of Alexandria for refusing to take the Chalcedonian profession of faith and refusing to reveal the whereabouts of Benjamin, who was himself a fugitive at that time. Monastic years Benjamin was noted for ascetic habits from an early age, and in 620, at the age of thirty, he took monastic vows at the monastery of Canopus, Egypt, which had avoided destruction by the Persians due to its isolated location. Benjamin further developed his asceticism in the cenobitic communities which followed the rule of Pachomius. It was at Canopus that Benjamin first met an older monk named Theonas, who presented Benjamin with the schema or monastic garment. Theonas instructed Benjamin in the virtues of the monastic life, including holiness, patience, and self-control, and in the study of the Bible.\\"Pope Benjamin I and the Islamic Conquest\\", Coptic Orthodox Church Theonas himself is said to have been particularly devoted to the Gospel of John, which he went so far as to memorize. Alexandria One night he heard in a vision someone saying to him, \\"Rejoice Benjamin, you will shepherd the flock of Christ.\\" When he told that to his spiritual father, he said to him, \\"The devil wants to hinder you. Beware of pride\\".\\"Departure of Abba Benjamin, the 38th Pope of Alexandria\\", Mission St. Clare Thenoas later brought Benjamin before the sitting Patriarch, Andronicus. Andronicus appreciated Benjamin's piety and ability, and took him on as a servant. He later ordained Benjamin to the priesthood, and eventually appointed him as his assistant, making Benjamin the heir presumptive to the patriarchy. In his position as assistant to the patriarch, Benjamin became acquainted with the intricacies of church affairs and within the Coptic Christian community. Benjamin became highly regarded for his work both within and without the church, which helped bring about his election to the patriarchate upon the death of Andronicus. Few records exist regarding the early years of Benjamin's tenure. He is known to have issued encyclicals regarding the dates of the observance of Easter, and instructing the clergy in doctrinal matters. He also worked to help his church through the end of Sassinid rule. Fifteen of his encyclicals from this time, all of which have been lost, were known to have been collected into a single volume, which has also been lost. In 623 A.D. the Persians captured Egypt. The Copts were prevented from practicing their religion, and their human and national rights were denied. Nevertheless, some Copts felt relief because alien Patriarchs were no longer appointed by Byzantium to oppress the Egyptian church. However, during that era the Persians ruined and destroyed many churches and monasteries. The Byzantines regained control in 628. In 631, Cyrus, the Chalcedonian bishop of Phasis, was appointed by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius as both the Melkite patriarch of Egypt and as the prefect in command of the military forces of that province of the empire. His duties in the latter position included curbing religious separatism in the province, by persuasion if possible but by arms if necessary. Benjamin, who was Cyrus's rival in the see of Alexandria, fled the city and sought refuge in the wilderness of St. Macarius, then in Upper Egypt. When persuasion failed, Cyrus began to use force. It was during this time that Benjamin's brother Mennas joined the rebellion against the rule of Cyrus for which he was eventually executed. Cyrus also confiscated the property of all clerics who followed the fugitive Benjamin, and many churches in Egypt were turned over to the Melkites by force. The Arab Muslim general 'Amr ibn al-'As began his campaign to conquer Egypt in 639, eventually invading Alexandria itself on September 17, 642. History does not record whether the members of the Coptic church assisted the Arabs in this campaign, although it is known that they did help the Melkites. During this time some individuals took the opportunity to ransack and burn churches. St. Mark\`s Church on the seashore was plundered, as well as the churches and monasteries that were surrounding it. 'Amr issued a safe conduct to Benjamin to return. Benjamin took some time in returning, eventually arriving at the end of 643 or the beginning of 644. Benjamin seems to have received funds from Sanutius, the ruler of Thebaid, for the rebuilding of the Church of St. Mark. Benjamin worked to bring back order to the affairs of the church, improve the morale of the Coptic population which had been devastated by the actions of Cyrus, and restore churches that were damaged during the recent conflict.\\"The Coptic Orthodox Church under Islam\\", The British Orthodox Church Within the Coptic Orthodox Patriarch He then left Alexandria again, to meet with 'Amr. In the historic meeting between these two individuals, 'Amr is quoted as having said that he had never seen such an impressive man of God as Benjamin. The exact details of the meeting between these two parties remain unknown. The meeting was however conducted with a dignity which was not witnessed during the Asian battles. At the end of the conference, 'Amr restored to Benjamin all the rights that he had been denied by the Byzantines, and recognized him as the sole representative of the Egyptian people. The Copts were however made to pay a higher tax (gezya). Benjamin for his part publicly prayed for 'Amr and addressed him with admiration. Benjamin worked to restore the Coptic church by renewing some of the policies which had been put in place by his predecessor Pope Damian of Alexandria. He also established amicable relations with 'Amr and the conquerors of Egypt. The Christian population of Egypt, however, remained divided between the Copts, Melkites, and other groups after the Arab conquest. Benjamin did however eventually prove successful in restoring a degree of unity to his fragmented population. Several Copts who had fled to the Libyan Pentapolis returned. A number of those who had left the Coptic church under duress for the Melkite church during the occupation, including the bishops Cyrus of Nikiou and Victor of Phiom, returned to the fold. He also exercised his new legal and judicial functions, even in accord with the Byzantine legal system, to the satisfaction of the new Islamic authorities. Benjamin engaged in pontifical visitations to the dioceses and monasteries of the church, restoring properties wherever necessary. One of his more remarkable feats during this period was the recovery of the head of Saint Mark, which the Melkites had intended to try to smuggle back to Byzantium. The head was probably left in the sanctuary of the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great in 645 or 647. Benjamin at the time also issued his canons to the monks of Saint Macarius. Benjamin helped guide and comfort the Coptic community during the early days of Islamic rule. 'Amr's successor, 'Abdallah ibn Sa'd ibn Abƒ´-al- Sar·∏• ibn al-·∏§ƒÅrith al-\\"ƒÄmirƒ´, demanded large amounts of money from the native Egyptian people whose resources were depleted. Benjamin's effort and intercession brought comfort to oppressed Copts. Benjamin spent the last two years of his life encumbered by severe illness. After enduring a prolonged period of great sufferering, he died on January 3, 661. Veneration He is regarded as a saint by the Coptic church, and is commemorated in the Coptic Synaxarion on the 8th day of Toba. Benjamin is widely celebrated for his role in guiding the Coptic church through the turmoil and upheaval of the Islamic conquest. His contemporaries' regard for him was so high that a legend was widely circulated after his death that Benjamin's soul was not only carried to heaven by angels, but also escorted by Athanasius of Alexandria, Severus of Antioch, and Theodosius I.

It was Baca's first mural and SPARC's first public art project. Its official title is The History of California. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description The Great Wall is located on Coldwater Canyon Avenue between Oxnard Street & Burbank Boulevard and the eastern edge of the Valley College campus in the San Fernando Valley community of Valley Glen. It is on the concrete sides of the Tujunga Wash, part of the drainage system of Los Angeles, California. The mural is 13 feet high, painted directly on concrete. With a length of 2,754 feet (840 m) (covering over 6 city blocks), it is credited as one of the longest murals in the world. Subject matter and style Section of the Great Wall of Los Angeles, September 2018 The Great Wall of Los Angeles depicts the history of California \\"as seen through the eyes of women and minorities\\" in many connected panels. The first panels begin with prehistory and colonialism. The very first panel was designed by Christina Schlesinger and depicts native wildlife and the creation story of the indigenous Chumash. Most of the following panels deal with events of the 20th century, including Chinese labor contributions to the United States, refugees from the Dust Bowl, the Great Depression, the Japanese-American internment of World War II, the Zoot Suit Riots, the Freedom Bus rides, the disappearance of Rosie the Riveter, gay rights activism, the story of Biddy Mason, deportations of Mexican Americans, the birth of rock and roll, and the development of suburbia. The wall covers the history of California up to the 1950s. Each section of the wall was designed by a different artist under the supervision of Baca. The Great Wall of Los Angeles places emphasis on the often overlooked history of Native Americans, minorities, LGBTQ-identified people, and those fighting for civil rights. Baca recalls that at the time, there was a lack of public art that represented the diverse heritage of Los Angeles. It was created in conjunction with the rise of the Chicano Movement of the 1960s-1980s. The mural is considered a cultural landmark. Because the Great Wall of Los Angeles depicts historical events, the mural is part of Grant High School and Valley College's curriculum. The style of the mural is considered to be Social Realism. The subject matter of the Great Wall of Los Angeles doesn't shy away from uncomfortable aspects of current and past social practices. The design and composition of the wall are also considered major aspects of the art's appeal. Baca's composition uses sweeping lines broken up by a sense of movement from the characters and subjects depicted. History Section of the Great Wall of Los Angeles, September 2018 The possibility of creating the mural was first brought up in 1974 when Baca was contacted by the Army Corps of Engineers about a beautification project. While Baca was working as a consultant for the Tujunga Wash Greenbelt Project, she was offered the chance to beautify the flood-control channel. The wall along the river was considered an ugly eyesore, or in Baca's view, \\"a scar where the river once ran\\". The Great Wall of Los Angeles as an idea was more fully fleshed out in 1976 by Baca. Baca chose to do an epic-sized history of Los Angeles county, going back as far as the time of the dinosaurs. She first researched highlights of Los Angeles history on her own. During the summer of 1977, Baca studied at the Taller Siqueiros in Cuernavaca to reinforce her knowledge of mural techniques, studying preservation, chemistry, and more. One important subject that she learned was the polyangular theory of David Alfaro Siqueiros, which deals with the differences between mural and easel painting. After Baca returned from studying mural-making techniques, she, with the help of her associates, converted an abandoned Venice police station into mural headquarters. There, she was able to coordinate workshops, archive materials relating to the project, and run other programs. The project was named SPARC. In addition to the many experts in various academic fields, Baca recruited a team of artists to help with the project, including Isabel Castro, Yreina Cervantez, Judith Hernandez, Olga Munoz, Patssi Valdez, Margaret Garcia, Christina Schlesinger, Judy Chicago, and Gary Tokumoto. With the additional help of the City, the Corps of Engineers, and SPARC, Baca was ready to start work by the summer of 1978. Each section of the Great Wall of Los Angeles was developed through a process called \\"Imagining of Content\\", which was developed at SPARC. The process includes research, inviting experts in various fields relating to the content, and members of the group working collectively to decide important cultural, political, artistic, and historical stories. The process also includes interviewing people who lived through parts of history, if possible. Imagining of Content is designed to help weed out biases. The artists involved with the process would take the information, create thumbnail sketches, and then submit these drawings to critique. The chosen thumbnails were finished in color and then transferred to the wall in large scale. The process from start to finish for each section of the wall took about a year. Originally, 80 young people from the juvenile justice program were recruited to help work on the mural. They worked about 25 hours a week and made minimum wage. The diversity of backgrounds among the young people was a challenge for Baca to coordinate. She recalls that there were \\"warring neighborhoods\\" and that her teams spoke many different languages. In addition, the people who lived in the middle-class neighborhood of Tujunga Wash were skeptical that this \\"invasion of juvenile delinquents\\" would behave themselves. Baca found a way to make things work harmoniously. She was labeled by her young workers as the \\"mural lady\\". She mentored many young people during the project. Baca felt that they were able to learn many useful skills, such as math, history, and art. This was important since many of them had few of these skills mastered at the time. In the years 1981 and 1983, additional young people were hired through a grant from the Jewish Community Foundation. The names of the young people who worked on the Great Wall of Los Angeles are recorded in various places on the mural. Over 400 young people helped paint the mural over the course of 6 summers. In addition, the work of 40 historians and 40 different artists helped make the Great Wall of Los Angeles a reality. Toward the very end of the project, a flood washed away all the necessary materials the artists needed to finish the project, including the scaffolding. The community donated $20,000, which was collected in the span of two weeks, to help the artists complete their work. The Great Wall of Los Angeles was finished in 1984.  Refurbishing and the future  Over time, the mural suffered environmental damage and required restoration. Between 1976 and 1983, the mural was flooded five times. Pollution and direct sun also eroded the art. It was estimated that it would cost over $400,000 to restore the Great Wall. A wooden pedestrian bridge that was used to view the wall became too worn over time and was removed as well. It was restored in 2011. The Santa Barbara-based Youth CineMedia program was chosen as the \\"official documentarians\\" of the restoration project in 2011. Restoration of the mural included artists and some of the original youth from the project putting in 8- and 12-hour days to complete the work. Plans for a bridge and solar lighting to allow additional viewing of the mural has been proposed as of 2014. A bridge will allow visitors to the mural to get closer to the art. The bridge was supposed to be part of the 2011 refurbishing project but was never completed. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a plan for the pedestrian bridge in 2014. The project is estimated to cost around $1.3 million and will be funded by the county, the City, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and the California Cultural Historical Endowment. Plans to continue the history of California beyond the 1950s are in the works. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has provided funds for the initial designs for the 1960s panel and for the scenes from the '70s and '80s. SPARC plans for the mural to be a mile long when sections for the 1970s through the 1990s are complete. In addition to a pedestrian bridge and additional history panels, plans for picnic tables, restrooms, educational information, and benches are being considered.  Comments by Baca  \\"Public art in America has taken a shift; it's basically becoming decorative. They've reduced the community process to censorship. The Great Wall, for example, could not be done today.\\"‚ÄîJudith Baca, 2000 \\"It's not just history, it's really about relationships‚Äîabout connecting.\\"‚ÄîJudith Baca, 2004 \\"The people who have worked on this project gave much more than their time.

Early life Brooke was born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and was educated in nearby Collegeville and West Chester. Civil War Brooke's military career began when he joined the 4th Pennsylvania Infantry with the rank of captain in April 1861. In August, he became colonel of the newly raised 53rd Pennsylvania Infantry and served in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. He temporarily commanded a brigade during the Battle of Antietam in September of that year. In May 1863, he was given permanent command of a brigade of the 1st Division of the II Corps, which he led in the Battle of Chancellorsville and during the Gettysburg Campaign. On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, Brooke found himself in the thick of the action when Confederate lieutenant general James Longstreet launched his assault against the Union lines south of Gettysburg. Rushed into action as reinforcements by Maj. Gen. Winfield Hancock, Colonel Brooke launched a limited counterattack against oncoming Confederate forces with his brigade in the Wheatfield. Although he was knocked out of action with a severe wound, his men temporarily stopped the Confederates and stabilized the Union line long enough to prevent a breakthrough. After recovery, Brooke subsequently also fought in the Overland Campaign, including the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House and other battles. He was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on May 12, 1864. General Brooke was critically wounded, again, at Cold Harbor in June. Brooke led a division in western Virginia late in the war. He was promoted to brevet major general in the volunteer army on August 1, 1864, for his service at Totopotomoy and Cold Harbor, and to brevet brigadier general in the regular army on March 2, 1867, for Spotsylvania Court House.Eicher, p. 145. Postbellum career In 1866, Brooke accepted a commission as the lieutenant colonel of the 37th U.S. Infantry of the regular army. Thirteen years later, he was given the position of colonel of the 13th U.S. Infantry, serving on the frontier in various posts. In 1888, he was promoted to brigadier general and was in command of the Department of the Platte when the Ghost Dance began in 1890. He was ordered by General Nelson Miles to rush the 7th U.S. Cavalry up to Wounded Knee. He left this command in 1895. In 1897, he was promoted to major general in the Regular Army and assigned to command the I Corps during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In Puerto Rico, he landed in Arroyo with General Hains, and reached Guayama by the time the armistice was signed. When General Miles left the island in October 1898 to return to the United States, Brooke became military governor and head of the army of occupation in the U.S. military government. On the December 6, Brooke was replaced by General Guy Vernor Henry, and by December 13, was named to the same position in Cuba. General Brooke was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (Companion #02434) and served as its national commander-in-chief from 1905 to 1907. He was also a member of the Minnesota Society of Colonial Wars and the Military Order of Foreign Wars. General Brooke retired from the Army on July 21, 1902, in Philadelphia, where he lived until his death at age 88 in 1926. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Family In 1863, Brooke married Louisa H. Roberts of Warwick, Pennsylvania. She died in 1867, and in 1877 he married Mary L. Stearns, the daughter of Governor Onslow Stearns. With his first wife, Brooke was the father of two sons, William and Louis. Legacy The troop transport , launched February 1943, was named in his honor. The former U.S. Army military post in San Juan, P.R., which encompassed El Morro Castle was named Fort Brooke in his honor.

Fort Mason served as an Army post for more than 100 years, initially as a coastal defense site and subsequently as a military port facility. During World War II, it was the principal port for the Pacific campaign. Today it is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the site of several cultural facilities. The entire fort area is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, with 49 buildings of historic significance, spread over .Noehill original nhldNoehill boundary increase while the lower port area is a National Historic Landmark District, designated for its role in World War II. Geography Fort Mason can be split into two distinct areas. The upper area, sometimes called Fort Mason, is situated on a headland and was the site of the original coastal fortifications. The lower area, Fort Mason Center, is situated close to water level to the west of Upper Fort Mason, and is the site of the former military port, with its piers and warehouses. The Marina Green lies to the west of Fort Mason, while Aquatic Park is to the east. History = Earlier private ownership by John C. Fr√©mont = The nucleus of Fort Mason was a private property owned by John C. Fr√©mont, the explorer of the western U.S., who also spearheaded the conquest of California from Mexico, and ran as the first presidential nominee of the extant Republican Party in 1856. As alleged in a 1968 federal lawsuit filed by his descendants over the 70-acre parcel then at issue, Fr√©mont bought a 13.5-acre property in the mid-1850s for $42,000, and then improved it by about $40,000. Appointed a major general in the Union army at the start of the Civil War, Fr√©mont's repeated serious conflicts with President Lincoln led him to resign by late 1862. In 1863, the government seized the property without payment, by executive order of Lincoln, on the grounds it was needed for the war effort. Fr√©mont would again contest the US presidency in 1864, running as the candidate of Radical Democracy Party, only resigning the effort when Lincoln fired a political enemy in his cabinet as a concession. The 1968 lawsuit was perhaps the last shot of a century-long legal struggleThe Stars and Stripes (February 20, 1958), p. 7 to obtain compensation for the seized realty. In 1870, the government returned property to 49 parties in the vicinity, but not to Fr√©mont and a few others. At that time, Fr√©mont was still very preoccupied with enough of the vast fortune he had made through gold-mining before the Civil War that the matter was unlikely of concern to him; but by 1872 he was in grave financial trouble he would never escape before his death in 1890. Over the years, at least 24 Congressional committees would vote to compensate Fr√©mont, and finally in February 1898 President William McKinley signed a bill directing that the court of claims fix the compensation due. But in 1968 the Fr√©mont heirs complained it had failed to carry out this direction, with John Fr√©mont then recently dead and his widow Jessie over 70 years old. = The fort as government property = The Civil War prompted the construction of several coastal defense batteries located inside the Golden Gate. Initially these defenses were built as temporary wartime structures rather than permanent fortifications and one of these was constructed in 1864 at Point San Jose, as the location of Upper Fort Mason was then known. A breast-high wall of brick and mounts for six Rodman cannons and six 42-pounder guns were built on the site. Excavation in the early 1980s uncovered the well-preserved remains of the western-half of the temporary battery, and it has now been restored to its condition during the Civil War. The fort was named Fort Mason in 1882, after Richard Barnes Mason, a former military governor of California. President Grover Cleveland established the Endicott Board in 1885 for the purpose of modernizing the nation's coastal fortifications. Chaired by Secretary of War William Endicott, the board recommended new defenses at 22 U.S. seaports, deeming San Francisco Harbor second only to that of New York in strategic importance. As a result, an extensive series of forts, batteries, and guns were built on the harbor, including Fort Mason. In 1904, the previous Division of the Pacific (1869-91) was re-established and formally stood up as the Pacific Division with subordinate or related commands, including the Department of California (to include the Hawaiian Islands) and the Department of the Columbia. The Pacific Division was headquartered at Fort Mason, San Francisco. By the end of 1907, the War Department, under Secretary of War William Howard Taft, had eliminated the echelon of administrative units called Divisions and subsequently the Pacific Division that same year. Notably, the first and only commander of the Pacific Division was Major General Arthur MacArthur Jr from 1903-1907. The piers and sheds of Lower Fort Mason were originally built from 1912 to warehouse army supplies and provide docking space for army transport ships. By this time, the US Army began to build new posts in Hawaii, the Philippines, and various other Pacific islands. Most of the materiel for those posts was shipped through San Francisco. By 1915, the three piers together with their associated warehouse had been completed, and Fort Mason Tunnel driven under Upper Fort Mason to connect with the railroad network along the Embarcadero. With these new facilities, Fort Mason was transformed from a harbor defense post into a logistical and transport hub for American military operations in the Pacific. The Army ferry provided scheduled transportation from Fort Mason to the processing center at Fort McDowell on Angel Island up to eight times per day during the war. was used to transport cavalry horses from Fort Mason's pier to Fort Mills. The SS Jeremiah O'Brien is a World War II era Liberty ship. Built in 57 days, the ship is an example of the United States rapid response to sealift demands of the war. Army Ports: Passengers and tons of cargo embarked during the period December 1941 ‚Äì August 1945. With the rest of the world at war since 1939, the U.S. Army began updating and improving facilities across the country, without however an improved budget. On 1 October 1940 Army Engineer Col John C. H. Lee was promoted to brigadier general, and named Commanding General, Pacific Ports of Embarkation. He set up shop at Fort Mason, and spent exactly a year improving Army port facilities from Seattle to San Diego. During World War II, Fort Mason became the headquarters of the San Francisco Port of Embarkation, controlling a network of shipping facilities that spread across the Bay Area. Over the years of the war, 1,647,174 passengers and 23,589,472 measured tons moved from the port into the Pacific. This total represents two-thirds of all troops sent into the Pacific and more than one-half of all Army cargo moved through West Coast ports. The highest passenger count was logged in August 1945 when 93,986 outbound passengers were loaded. The Korean War in the 1950s also kept the post busy, and in 1955 the San Francisco Port of Embarkation was renamed the U.S. Army Transportation Terminal Command Pacific. The embarkation operations continued through the early sixties. In 1965 the headquarters of the US Army Transportation Terminal Command were transferred to the Oakland Army Terminal, and most of Fort Mason's embarkation facilities fell into disuse. The Army continues to use and maintain the old officer housing. The National Park Service took over the administration of the site in the 1970s as a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In 1976 lower Fort Mason became the Fort Mason Center, a non profit organization that provides a destination for programs, events and organizations that support and reflect the evolving cultural fabric of San Francisco and the Bay Area. (GGNRA). Current uses GGNRA headquarters building in Upper Fort Mason Some of the old officer housing remains in use by the Army, while some is rented to the public. One of the larger buildings has been converted into a youth hostel, operated by Hostelling International USA.http://www.hiusa.org/hostels/usa_hostels/california/san_francisco/60001 As a whole, the former post is now a mix of parks and gardens and late nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings that are still in use. A path follows the harbor edge, rising along the headland and offering views north past Alcatraz and west to the Golden Gate Bridge. The lower portion of the site is known as the Fort Mason Center for Arts & Culture (FMCAC). FMCAC is a non- profit and their campus houses the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Artists Gallery, San Francisco Art Institute graduate campus, Blue Bear School of Music, City College of San Francisco Art Campus, The Interval, Greens Restaurant, Readers Bookstore, Magic Theatre, the Mexican Museum, Embark Gallery, Off the Grid, BATS Improv, San Francisco Children's Art Center, Museo ItaloAmericano, Flax art & design, California Lawyers for the Arts and other organizations connected to arts and culture.http://fortmason.org/residents/ The newest space is Gallery 308, whose inaugural exhibition was Janet Cardiff'sThe Forty Part Motet (November 14, 2015 ‚Äì January 18, 2016), followed by Sophie Calle's Missing (June 22, 2017 ‚Äì August 20, 2017). In the fall of 2017, the San Francisco Art Institute opened a graduate program campus, housed in FMCAC's historic Herbst Pavilion. The National Park Service headquarters for both the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park are located in Fort Mason. Operations for the United States Park Police are located in the fort, providing police services for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco and Marin County. Every Friday since 2010 from March through October, an Off the Grid gathering of food trucks occurs and draws large crowds. Future developments A proposal exists to extend the F Market & Wharves or E Embarcadero historic streetcar line to a terminal at Lower Fort Mason. This extension would run from the vicinity of the existing terminal near Fisherman's Wharf, westward alongside the San Francisco Maritime Museum and Aquatic Park, and then through the existing, now unused, San Francisco Belt Railroad tunnel under Upper Fort Mason. A technical feasibility study, under the aegis of the National Park Service and San Francisco Municipal Railway, was completed in December 2004. An Environmental Impact Statement for the extension, involving the San Francisco Municipal Railway, National Park Service and Federal Transit Administration, commenced in May 2006. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was completed in March 2011, and was scheduled to be reviewed by December 2011.

Built in 1890, the building originally served as a trolley barn, before becoming a multi-purpose arena. The Gardens opened 3 years after a fire destroyed the city's prior sports arena, the Schenley Park Casino, in 1896. Over the years, the Gardens was the home arena of several of Pittsburgh's historic sports teams, such as ice hockey's Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Hornets. The Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, which was the first ice hockey league to openly hire and trade players, played all of its games at the Gardens. The arena was also the first hockey rink to ever use glass above the dasher boards. Developed locally by the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, Herculite glass was first tested in Pittsburgh. Most rinks were using wire mesh before the shatterproof glass was invented. Finally, the Pittsburgh Ironmen, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America (a forerunner of the National Basketball Association), played at the Gardens from 1946 to 1947. Outside team sports, the Duquesne Garden Ball Room, located on the arena's second floor, was also one of the largest dance halls in the country during the time. History =Beginnings: 1890‚Äì1910= Share of the Duquesne Traction Company, issued 23. November 1892 The Gardens was originally built in 1890 as the Duquesne Traction Company, which served Pittsburgh as a trolley barn, in the city's Oakland neighborhood. In 1895, Christopher Lyman Magee, a Pittsburgh politician, spent nearly $500,000 ($ in ) to purchase and renovate the building. He renamed the structure the Duquesne Gardens in 1896, although it was always called the \\"Arena\\" by the locals. The Gardens, which had the world's largest indoor ice rink and a second-floor ballroom, became a premier indoor venue. The Duquesne Gardens on January 19, 1901. The Pittsburgh Athletic Club vs. Queen's University. Queen's won, 1-0, in front of 5,523 at the Gardens. This postcard of the event was published in 1909Speed skating, roller skating, dance contests, musical performances, roller derby, bicycle racing, and college basketball were all hosted at the Gardens, as were rodeos and the circus. The Gardens also featured Pittsburgh Golden Gloves boxing and housed a movie theater. The Duquesne Garden Ball Room, located on the second floor, has been used by some of the leading clubs and societies in the city for their annual dances. The building quickly became the site for all manner of gatherings: There were opera performances, boxing matches and political rallies. However, the facility's main attraction was its artificial ice surface, unrivaled in North America. Most other American cities lacked a facility that produced artificial ice at the time. And with 26,000 square feet of ice surface at the Gardens, was nearly 50 feet longer than the modern-day rinks in the National Hockey League (NHL) and had state-of-the-art refrigeration and resurfacing technology. On January 24, 1899, the Gardens hosted its first ice hockey game in a match between the Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Western University of Pennsylvania (University of Pittsburgh). According to Total Hockey, the official encyclopedia of the NHL, Pittsburgh was one of the first cities in North America to lure amateur Canadian players for what was a standard $30 a week stipend and a local job in the early 1900s. The manager of a Canadian team returned from a trip to the Gardens in 1902, according to an account in Total Hockey, and gave the following description to the Toronto Globe: \\"Pittsburgh is hockey crazy. Over 10,000 turned out for our three games there. The general admission being 35 cents and 75 cents for a box seat . . . the Pittsburgh rink is a dream . . . What a marvellous place it is.\\" The teams of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, and the Pittsburgh Professionals of the International Professional Hockey League, played their games at the Gardens up until 1910. The Gardens' artificial ice surface helped make Pittsburgh a professional hockey pioneer, much the way the region had given birth to the first professional American football players in the 1890s. Players in the WPHL were paid to play hockey before 1904, but that is when the first professional league officially formed. The Pittsburgh Professionals joined Canadian Soo, Michigan Soo, Calumet Miners, and the Portage Lakes Hockey Club to form the IPHL in 1904. However, after the 1906‚Äì07 season, other professional leagues began popping up and the IPHL disbanded, while the WPHL was revived until 1910. During this era, Garnet Sixsmith, who played on several Pittsburgh teams, once scored 11 goals in a game at the Gardens. His 11 goals is considered to be a record for the arena. =Olympics, Yellow Jackets and Pirates: 1910-1936= Between 1910 and 1915, hockey games were mostly played at the Winter Garden at Exposition Hall, located near the city's Point. Therefore, the Gardens was used mostly for recreational skating and amateur hockey matches for teams. Crowds also attended skating sessions at Gardens and took part in public skating events. Public skating was held every evening, except on days for performances, with Saturday morning being set aside for school children who wanted to learn how to skate. Exterior of the Gardens c. 1909However in 1911, Lester Patrick started the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, and in order to learn how to generate artificial ice, he came to the Duquesne Gardens to study the procedure. On March 16, 1920, the United States men's national ice hockey team was founded at the Gardens. That same year at the Gardens, Roy Schooley, the arena's manager, put together an 11-player squad that won silver at the Antwerp Games, in the sport's Olympic debut. The Gardens also hosted several contests, which were played on Mondays and Tuesdays, to help raise money in order to cover the expenses associated with sending the U.S. Olympic Hockey team to the games held in Antwerp, Belgium. In 1915, the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets of the United States Amateur Hockey Association (USAHA) were founded. The team evolved from being an amateur to a semi-pro franchise. The Pittsburgh Athletic Associations's Seven, an amateur hockey club, as well as the Carnegie Tech hockey club and the University of Pittsburgh hockey team also played their home games at the Gardens in 1919. By 1924, the Yellow Jackets of the USAHA's Western Division were so dominant that they spun off another Pittsburgh team, the Hornets, who played in the Eastern Division. In 1925, both Pittsburgh club's won the respective divisions and played each other for the 1924-1925 USAHA championship at the Gardens. The Yellow Jackets won the title in a best of seven series, 4 games to none. The Pittsburgh Duquesne Garden Hockey Team, 1915-16 USAHA Champions In 1925, the Yellow Jackets were sold to James Callhan and New York-based bootlegger William Dwyer and were renamed the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates then joined the NHL on November 7, 1925. During this time, the Gardens' massive ice surface was reduced to conform to the NHL's standards. Pittsburgh's first ever NHL game was played on December 2, 1925, with the Pirates taking on the New York Americans in front of 8,200 fans. The Pirates lost the game in overtime, 2-1. By 1930, financial issues, associated with the Great Depression caused the Pirates to relocate to Philadelphia, before folding. What helped make the city such a hotbed for hockey in the early part of the century, the Duquesne Gardens, ultimately helped doom the Pirates. The Gardens held slightly more than 5,000 fans, which was fine at the turn of the century but small by comparison in the late 1920s to other arenas sprouting up, such as 18,000-seat Madison Square Garden. The Pirates did not make very much money playing in the 5,000 seat Gardens. The team was so strapped for money that they traded Conacher to the New York Americans during the 1926-27 season for a journeyman player and $2,000. Conacher had been the highest-paid NHL player at $7,500 a year. The Pirates later moved the team across the state to become the Philadelphia Quakers for the franchise's last season in 1930-31. However the Gardens still witnessed ice hockey even during these dark financial times. In 1930, Roy Schooley re-acquired the rights to the Yellow Jackets. The Jackets played for two years in the International Hockey League (IHL) before the team was purchased in 1932 by Pittsburgh theatre chain owner John H. Harris, who purchased a new $5,000 sanitary soda fountain for the Gardens and renovated a portion of the building to become one of the largest dance halls in America, back in 1920. By 1935, the Yellow Jackets returned to being an amateur club in the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. In 1936, Harris and the Yellow Jackets helped provide Pittsburgh with another professional hockey team, the Pittsburgh Shamrocks and established that the Gardens' ice time would be split by the new IHL team and the Yellow Jackets. Yellow Jackets' owner, John H. Harris, also leased Duquesne Gardens, and began scheduling events, including ice hockey, boxing, and rodeos. One notable rodeo act to come to the Gardens was Roy Rogers and his horse Trigger, who performed there on April 30, 1945. =Hornets, Ice Capades and Ironmen: 1936-1955= The Demolition of the Gardens in August 1956Several other historic events took place at the Gardens during Harris' tenure. First, on March 31, 1936 he hired Sonja Henie, a 24-year-old Norwegian figure skater, to perform before a Yellow Jackets' home game. Harris found it difficult to draw a large crowd to hockey games during the Great Depression, so he hired Henie to entertain the audience between periods. The performances were a rousing success, and Harris soon set out to create an ice show to rival the song and dance spectaculars that were popular on Broadway. He developed the Ice Capades, which premiered in September 1940. The skating corps of 150 young women clad in elaborate costumes captivated audiences. Harris's Ice Capades, founded in Pittsburgh with an $85,000 investment, was sold in 1963 for $5.5 million. Harris also used the Gardens for Ice Capades auditions and as the show's training school, since many of the show's performers were from western Pennsylvania. Then on October 4, 1936, Harris purchased the Detroit Olympics and moved the team to Pittsburgh, where they were renamed the Pittsburgh Hornets, and became a member of the American Hockey League. Some players from the Yellow Jackets and Shamrocks players then joined the Hornets. The Yellow Jackets formally folded, while the Gardens would be home for the Hornets for the next 20 seasons. The Hornets played their first game at the Gardens on November 8, 1936, a 5-2 win over the Cleveland Barons. The franchise later won Calder Cups in 1951, versus the Providence Reds, and in 1955, versus the Buffalo Bisons. On January 10, 1956, the Gardens hosted the American Hockey League All Star Game for the city of Pittsburgh. However the Gardens was also the home for Duquesne University Basketball as well as the Pittsburgh Ironmen of the Basketball Association of America, a forerunner to the NBA. The team ended their only season in the BAA in 1946-47 with a record of 15-45. The Ironmen consisted of players like Press Maravich, a future college coach and father to Hall of Famer Pete Maravich, and Moe Becker. The arena also hosted the first of 16 NBA neutral site regular season games played in Pittsburgh. Another sport played at the Gardens was tennis. On January 15, 1937, the Gardens hosted a championship tennis match between world champions Ellsworth Vines and Fred Perry. Concerts The Gardens also featured several notable concert acts throughout its history. On July 4, 1929, Jelly Roll Morton and his jazz band, the Red Hot Peppers, played the Gardens. Then in August 1933, the arena hosted Cab Calloway and his orchestra. Segments of Calloway's show there was then broadcast over the radio. The Gardens also hosted, opera singer, Enrico Caruso. Demolition and legacy A section of brick wall from the Duquesne Gardens which was reconstructed and placed inside of 250px While the Gardens earned much praise in its early days, the place was outdated by the 1920s. About 15,000 fans could be comfortably seated in Madison Square Garden, Boston Garden, and Montreal Forum. Not even half that number could squeeze into the Gardens. Around this time, the ice-making operation at the Garden was antiquated. In November 1927, the Toronto Star reported that the Pirates had to train at a local gym instead of the Garden, since the Garden's ice machine had broken down. However, while celebrating its 40th anniversary, the Garden still boasted as having one of the highest-regarded ice surfaces in North America, still drawing hockey players from Canada. The Gardens was demolished in 1956 to make way for an apartment building and a local fixture, Stouffer's Restaurant. Stouffer's, which became Duranti's Restaurant in 1979, featured the only remaining evidence of the Gardens, two 11-foot wide sections of exposed red brick wall, which would have been the back wall of the Gardens' visiting dressing room. Duranti's then closed in December 2008 and the apartment building that replaced the Gardens was to be torn down and renovated. Jim Kubus, the editor of pittsburghhockey.net, a local history site, and his brother removed the bricks before the wall could be destroyed and stored them for the next two years. Today, a Captain Morgan-sponsored lounge, which is located inside Pittsburgh's current multi-purpose arena, the PPG Paints Arena, contains a small section of that particular wall from the Duquesne Gardens. Billy Conn, the famed Pittsburgh boxer who nearly won a match against Joe Louis, fought at the Gardens. On June 18, 1998, the intersection where the Gardens once stood was dedicated as \\"Billy Conn Blvd.\\" Demolition of The Gardens brought a temporary end to professional ice hockey in Pittsburgh, as there was no other suitable arena to replace it. The Rochester Americans replaced the Hornets in the AHL. Construction of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena began in 1958, three miles to the west of the Gardens.

It was held that the veil can only be lifted where it would be \\"just and equitable\\", specifically to third parties. The case is also a leading source of insurance law. The insurer refused to indemnify Mr. Kosmopoulos on the grounds that the corporation owned the property, even though he was the sole-shareholder of the corporation. The insurer's position was consistent with the 1925 decision of the House of Lords in Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd. Although the SCC rejected the plaintiffs corporate veil argument, and his bailee argument, the court did not uphold the Macaura rule. The ratio of this case is that an insured may recover an indemnity so long as they meet the factual expectancy test, regardless of whether they have bare legal title to the subject matter of the insurance contract. Background Mr. Kosmopoulos had a leather goods company for which he was the sole shareholder and director. His lease for the company office was under his own name from when he originally ran the business as a sole proprietor.The fire insurance policies showed the insured as being the sole proprietor even though the insurance agency was well aware of the fact that the business was being carried on by the incorporated company. (His insurance agency knew that he was under the lease as himself but carried on business as a corporation.) A fire in a neighbouring lot damaged his office; however, the insurance company refused to cover his damages. Under the common law, as established by Salomon v. Salomon, corporations are entirely separate entities from those who run it, and thus contracts made by the company cannot apply to anyone but the company itself. Business corporations are purely a creature of statute; there is no common law basis for the proposition that a corporation is a separate legal entity from that of its shareholder (that is, this paragraph questions part of the veracity of the preceding paragraph). Although Salomon v. Salomon is often cited as a reference for that proposition, the decision in Salomon v. Salomon was based on the clear language of the statute under which the corporation at issue was created, namely the Companies Act 1862 (UK). Nevertheless, although it is based solely on statute, business corporations are in fact separate legal entities: for example, ¬ß15(1) of the Canada Business Corporations Act states that \\"[a] corporation has the capacity and, subject to this Act, the rights, powers and privileges of a natural person.\\" At trial, the judge held that Mr. Kosmopoulos could not recover damages as owner for the assets of the business as they were owned by the company and not him, but that he could recover as insured because of his insurable interest in the building. This ruling was upheld on appeal, with the court noting that as companies could, thanks to recent laws, have a sole shareholder, Macaura could be restricted to cases involving multiple shareholders. The issue before the Court was whether the assets of Mr. Kosmopoulos, as shareholder, were covered by the insurance. Reasons of the court The Court upheld the ruling of the lower courts. First of all, the Court decided that this was not a situation where they should \\"lift the corporate veil\\". To reach this conclusion the Court examined the requirements to \\"lift the veil\\". Wilson J. explained: The Court decided that in the current case, lifting the veil would unfairly allow the owner to enjoy the benefits of incorporation while avoiding the costs. The court also rejected the owner's argument that he was a bailor (i.e., taking care) of the companies' assets. Since the company still \\"possessed\\" the assets, they could not be considered as bailed without \\"lifting the veil\\". However, the court found that the owner, as insured, held an insurable interest in the assets‚Äîthat is, he had enough of a link to the assets to validly insure them (one cannot insure, for example, a building they have nothing to do with). In doing so, the court rejected the Macaura principle that limited an insurable interest to those having legal or equitable title to an asset. Instead, they applied the \\"factual expectancy test\\" (another test proposed by the House of Lords in Lucena v. Craufurd,Lucena v. Craufurd (1806), 2 Bos. & Pul. (N.R.) 269, 127 E.R. 630 the 1806 case relied on for the Macaura decision). According to this test, in order to insure something and recover for it, one must have \\"some relation to, or concern in the subject of the insurance, which relation or concern by the happening of the perils insured against may be so affected as to produce a damage, detriment, or prejudice to the person insuring\\". Ownership, or title, to the insured asset is not required under this test.

Common names include swamp cyrilla, swamp titi, red titi, black titi, white titi, leatherwood, ironwood, he huckleberry, and myrtle. Habitat It grows in swamps, along streams, bogs, bayheads, backwaters, wet prairies, low pinelands, pocosins, flatwood depressions, preferring acidic, sandy, or peaty soils. Description In tropical rainforests, it is a small tree growing to 10 m or more tall, but only a shrub to 4 m tall in temperate regions at the northern edge of its range. It is most recognizable from its white flowers which are noticeable on the plant during the summer months. It is primarily evergreen, but during the autumn months some of the leaves turn a brilliant red before falling, and plants at the northern edge of its range tend to be deciduous. The leaves are alternate, simple, oblanceolate to oval, rounded or pointed at the tip, narrowed to the base, thick, without teeth, smooth, sometimes nearly evergreen, reticulate- veined, 4‚Äì10 cm long and 1.2‚Äì3 cm broad. The flowers are crowded in 8‚Äì15 cm long racemes borne on the previous year's twigs; each flower is 5‚Äì10 mm diameter, with five white petals, and is subtended by a slender bract.

Estimates for the cost of the megaproject are ‚Ç¨1.62 billion ($ billion) for the main line and ‚Ç¨640 million ($ million) for the Kalamaria extension, for a total of ‚Ç¨2.26 billion ($ billion). The project is primarily funded with loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and funds from the Greek government. Construction by a Greek-Italian consortium is overseen by Attiko Metro S.A., the Greek state-owned company which oversaw construction of the Athens Metro and Athens Tram. Proposed during the 1910s and first seriously planned in the 1980s, construction of the main line began in 2006 and on the Kalamaria extension in 2013. Although the initial proposal included three extensions to the main line, the latest Attiko Metro proposal seeks to combine the two westward extensions as a loop; the system will be made up of the main line and the Kalamaria and Evosmos extensions. The system under construction has 18 stations and of tunnels. Detailed planning of the airport extension went to tender in March 2019, while the Western loop went to tender in August of the same year. After years of delays, due mainly to archaeological discoveries in the city centre during construction and in part to the Greek financial crisis, most of the main line is scheduled to open in April 2023. The system will be entirely driverless and remote-controlled. History =1918 and 1988 proposals= Line 1. Ernest H√©brard and Thomas Hayton Mawson were the first to propose the creation of a metro system in Thessaloniki in 1918 as part of a commission appointed by the government of Eleftherios Venizelos to redesign the city after the Great Fire of 1917, which had devastated the city centre. They proposed an underground rail line to allow easy access from the city centre to the planned outskirts of the city in the east. Although Thessaloniki has grown considerably since H√©brard's original design, Line 1 is almost identical to his plan and runs from his proposed New Railway Station to the suburb of Nea Elvetia. The project never materialised. A circular metro line was proposed in 1968, extending to the airport and crossing the Thermaic Gulf in a tunnel. The idea of a metro was revived during the 1980s. In 1988, under Mayor Sotiris Kouvelas, the city published studies for its Thessaloniki Metro development plan and construction of the project's first phase. The line was almost identical to the modern line, with 14 stations between the New Railway Station and Nea Elvetia. The plan had one additional station, Patrikiou, between and and had alternative names for three stations. is shown as Vardari, an alternative name for the public square served by the station; is listed as Alkazar (Hamza Bey Mosque, on the corner of Egnatia and Venizelou Streets), and is shown as Archaeological Museum. The network would be within the city limits, excluding Kalamaria and a large portion of Thessaloniki's metropolitan area. Of the of track proposed, would be underground and above ground. Route diagram of the 1988 proposal for a network (in red), with future extensions in blue In 1989, construction began on the first of tunnel along Egnatia street between the Thessaloniki International Fair grounds and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (the present station). Construction was carried out with the cut-and-cover method instead of a tunnel boring machine. The proposed metro was only beneath ground level at but dropped to about towards the New Railway Station, creating archaeological problems similar to those encountered during construction of the current system. Although construction was scheduled to end in 1995, the project stalled and the unfinished (but excavated) initial cut- and-cover section became known as \\"the hole of Kouvelas\\" (, i trypa tou Kouvela). The project ultimately failed due to a series of unsuccessful contract competitions and appeals of awarded contracts. Another obstacle was lack of interest by Greece's central government. Thessaloniki attempted to fund the project on its own, saying that European Union member states were prepared to cover 50 percent of the project costs and provide favourable loans for the remainder, but without the central-government's involvement the plan did not go forward. One reason for the lack of central-government support was Greece's political polarisation during the 1980s; Kouvelas represented the centre-right New Democracy party when the country was governed by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement. Plans for a Thessaloniki metro were abandoned until the 2000s. =Final proposal= Evolution of the metro In 2018, Attiko Metro S.A. was overseeing the construction of a two-line, twin-tunnel system composed of Line 1 (the base project) and Line 2 (the Kalamaria Extension). Although Line 1 has been delayed by extensive archaeological works, Line 2's construction is proceeding on schedule. Construction of tunnels for both lines was finished in 2018, and track-laying began in August of that year. Line 1 is scheduled to open in April 2023, while Line 2 will be operational in December 2023. Both lines are designed to serve a minimum of 18,000 passengers per hour in each direction, with a 90-second headway. The completed metro will reduce Thessaloniki's greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 5,000 tons a year, and reduce travel time by up to 66 percent. Network =Line 1 (Base Project)= Topographic map of Line 1 What is known as the Base Project () began in 2003, when Attiko Metro and the Greek government agreed to cooperate on a public works project Government support was instrumental, since lack of government support for the 1988 proposal was the primary reason it had failed. The project issued a request for tender in 20042005, and the successful Greco- Italian consortium (which included AnsaldoBreda) began construction in late June 2006. An alternate consortium, Macedonian Metro (), was barred by the European Court of Justice from participating in the tender because it changed its composition after the tender proceedings began (violating EU law). The project was budgeted at ‚Ç¨1.05 billion ($ billion), with 25 percent funding from the Greek government and 75 percent funded by loans from the European Investment Bank and the European Regional Development Fund. The latest available Attiko Metro financial data put the official estimated cost at ‚Ç¨1.28 billion ($ billion). An April 2019 update raised the estimated cost to ‚Ç¨1.62 billion ($ billion). Line 1 runs within the municipality of Thessaloniki, the core of the Thessaloniki urban area, calling at 13 stations. It has two parallel single-track tunnels on a route between (N. Sid. Stathmos, at the city's New Railway Station) and , with further southeast. Although construction began in 2006, major archaeological finds in the city centre delayed the project considerably. Disputes between Attiko Metro, the city council, and archaeologists reached Greece's Council of State, the country's highest administrative court, in 2015. The original schedule had Line 1 operational by 2012. Attiko Metro redesigned several stations in a solution which became known as \\"antiquities and metro\\" (). Some finds discovered on the line will be put on display at permanent in-station exhibitions, while the major discoveries at will make up the world's first publicly-accessible open- air archaeological site contained in situ within a metro station. Construction of the tunnels was completed on 31 July 2018, 12 years and one month after breaking ground. That day, the architectural work on Line 1 was reported as 80 percent finished. In August 2018, tracks and electronic signalling equipment began installation. The line will enter service in its entirety, between and , in 2020 but will not stop at and , which will open at a later date. By February 2019 construction on the main line was 95 percent completed and platform screen doors were beginning to be installed, while the Supreme Council for Civil Personnel Selection was planning a competition to fill the first 28 Thessaloniki Metro employee positions. Archaeological excavations at the construction site of Aghia Sofia station in September 2018. Despite the progress, in September 2019 Greece's new conservative cabinet announced a further 28-month delay to the project, pushing the opening date from November 2020 to April 2023 and citing costly archaeological works at as the reason. The new Minister of Infrastructure and Transport announced that the government had decided to scrap the previous plan to keep the archaeological discoveries in situ within the station at Venizelou, choosing instead to disassemble them and re-assemble them at a later stage, noting that excavation costs had exceeded ‚Ç¨130 million ($ million), more than the cost of the new Acropolis Museum. Thessaloniki's new conservative mayor, Konstantinos Zervas, as well as Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis, supported this move. Mitsotakis also announced at the Thessaloniki International Fair that a new archaeological museum would be built specifically to house archaeological artefacts unearthed during the construction of the metro. The new head of Attiko Metro accused archaeologists of \\"looking to the past; we need to look forward\\". The decision to disassemble the archaeological finds, dubbed a \\"Byzantine Pompeii\\", was strongly criticised, and a citizens' group has taken the government to court over the issue for a second time, supported by former mayor Yiannis Boutaris among others. Part of the objection has to do with the fact that the government has not carried out any studies as to how it will return and re- assemble the artefacts once the station has been built; this course of action was adopted for the construction of Aghia Sofia station, where the archaeological discoveries were more significant than those at Venizelou, but the re-assembly of the artefacts on site is now impossible because Attiko Metro never constructed any space dedicated to the re-assembly of the artefacts it disassembled, despite having promised to do so. In April 2020, the International Association of Byzantine Studies (AIEB) wrote to Prime Minister Mitsotakis to protest the removal of the antiquities from their original location, saying that the discoveries constituted \\"a cultural and scientific jewel\\" and that \\"it would be a tragedy to jeopardise [Greece's reputation for monument preservation] by squandering the treasure of the Thessaloniki material and data through an unnecessarily hasty construction project\\", arguing that the previous decision to leave the discoveries in-situ was preferable. =Line 2 (Kalamaria Extension)= Topographic map of Line 2 The Kalamaria Extension () extends the metro system to Kalamaria, the second- largest municipality in the Thessaloniki urban area and the 18th-most-populous in Greece. Similar in construction to Line 1, it has two parallel single-track tunnels on a route between and and adds five stations to the network. Construction on the project began in 2013, with an budget of ‚Ç¨518 million ($ million). By 31 July 2018, the extension was 60 percent completed. Although construction began seven years after Line 1, it is expected to fully enter service in December 2023. This is due to the lack of major archaeological works, enabling the project to proceed without delays. The latest Attiko Metro financial statement puts the extension's costs at ‚Ç¨568 million ($ million). An April 2019 update raised the estimated cost to ‚Ç¨640 million ($ million). The line is made up of 16 stations, 11 of which are also stations served by Line 1. After confusion about the extension's place in the system, Attiko Metro clarified in August 2018 that it would be a separate line running between and without the need to change trains at . The extension of Line 2 to Makedonia Airport went to tender in March 2019 with an initial budget of ‚Ç¨254,150 ($ thousand) for topographical works in order to enable more detailed planning of the line. =Future extensions= The system is planned to be extended further, with a four-station eastern extension to Line 2 (towards Macedonia International Airport) and an eight-station loop in the west. The latter is a priority for Attiko Metro to connect the city's western working class suburbs with the city centre, since the airport will be serviced by a 10-minute shuttle-bus trip to (the eastern terminus of Line 2). The two western extensions were originally planned as separate lines, but were merged into a single circular line of in length in 2018. Work on the western extensions was scheduled to enter the tendering process in the autumn 2018. Attiko Metro confirmed in early 2019 that preliminary works for the western loop will begin in 2019. According to Attiko Metro, the double-track airport extension will be a mixture of underground, grade-level, and elevated railway elements. It may be extended south to better serve commuters to and from Chalkidiki. The western loop will be extended with three branches, adding four stations. Detailed planning of the eastern extension to the airport is set to begin in March 2019 and be finished in time for the project to be financed as part of the 20212027 funding cycle of the European Regional Development Fund. This happened on 18 March. The proposed route starts at the airport and follows Greek National Road 67 before joining Greek National Road 16 and then connecting with station and the rest of Line 2. Operations =Stations, depot and rolling stock= All 18 stations currently under construction were designed with platform screen doors for maximum protection, while the trains will be driverless. Eighteen AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro units will be in service on Line 1, and 15 on Line 2. The articulated, four-car trains will be long. They will have seating for 96 passengers and standing room for 370 more. The trains will use 750 V DC third rail electrification, while tracks have been laid to the standard gauge of . A carriage was on display at the September 2018 Thessaloniki International Fair before trial runs in 2019. As of August 2019 two complete train sets have been delivered to the depot, with an additional train set expected every 2 to 3 months. The system's level of automation has prompted Attiko Metro to call it \\"the most modern metro in Europe\\". A depot is under construction with the intention of serving both lines, with a total built-up area of and a total cost of ‚Ç¨130.5 million ($ million). Apart from being the system's automated remote control command centre, the complex will also house the offices of Attiko Metro, the Thessaloniki Transport Authority (TheTA), and the Thessaloniki Metro operating company, as well as railway stock maintenance facilities, two restaurants, and a cr√®che. It is expected that the development of the depot will attract investment to the area, and there have been calls to make provisions for a passenger station at the depot. The depot complex is expected to be finished in May 2019.

Additional parking will be created at , the terminus of Line 2. Attiko Metro conducted a 2005 survey to determine Thessaloniki residents' preferred fare for the metro compared to the standard price of a Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (OASTH) bus ticket (‚Ç¨0.50 at the time). Of the 400 respondents, 47.6 percent said that they were willing to pay the same price and 48.1 percent said they would pay more. Of the latter, 19.9 percent said that they would pay ‚Ç¨0.60; 19.6 percent would pay ‚Ç¨0.70, and 8.6 percent would be willing to pay ‚Ç¨1.00 (double the cost of a bus ticket). The remaining 4.7 percent responded with another fare. A standard 2018 single-trip OASTH bus ticket is ‚Ç¨1.00, or ‚Ç¨0.50 with a discount. Thessaloniki Metro will utilise an electronic card ticketing system as well as fare gates, a system not originally implemented on the Athens Metro. Archaeology The Thessaloniki Metro line (marked in yellow) runs through the city's historic centre below its Decumanus Maximus. A large number of important archaeological finds, primarily Roman and early Christian and Byzantine, have been discovered during the metro's construction. The project triggered the largest archaeological dig in northern Greek history, covering a area. Between the New Railway Station and Sintrivani/Ekthesi, the metro runs below Egnatia Street (one of Thessaloniki's main arteries). Egnatia follows the Roman Via Egnatia, which connected Rome and Constantinople as one of the two most important roads in the Roman and Byzantine empires. The portion of the Via Egnatia which passed through Thessaloniki was the city's Decumanus Maximus (main road), and runs below present-day Egnatia Street at below ground level. Although the location of the Via Egnatia in Thessaloniki was known when the metro line was planned, it was uncertain what else was buried nearby. The metro was planned to run at below ground, leaving only between it and the ancient road. The discovery of a Byzantine road at Venizelou station was a major archaeological find: of the marble-paved and column-lined road was unearthed, with shops, other buildings, and plumbing which one scholar called \\"the Byzantine Pompeii\\". A crossroads, marked with a tetrapylon, was found at Venizelou where the Decumanus Maximus crossed a cardo (a north-south road). An additional of the same road was discovered at the station. Issues concerning archaeological finds and the display of artefacts in the metro system are more complex than similar issues surrounding the construction of the New Acropolis Museum. Other important discoveries included a headless statue of Aphrodite, fourth-century-AD mosaics, a golden wreath, a bath complex, urban villas, and 50,000 coins. Artefacts from the 1917 fire were also found. The discovery sparked controversy in Thessaloniki; Attiko Metro wanted to remove the antiquities and re-assemble them elsewhere, and the city's archaeological services wanted the company to alter the depth of the line and the station entrances. The city council sided with the archaeological services in 2015, three years after the metro was originally planned to begin service. Mayor Yiannis Boutaris took the case to the Council of State, Greece's highest administrative court. Attiko Metro redesigned the line, sinking the tunnels to depths from and providing for mini-museums in the stations similar to the Syntagma metro station in Athens (which houses the Syntagma Metro Station Archaeological Collection). The Venizelou station will contain an open archaeological site, the world's first metro station to do so. The archaeological excavations are currently budgeted at ‚Ç¨132 million ($ million), compared with the original archaeological budget of ‚Ç¨15 million ($ million), and employ 300 archaeologists. Over 300,000 artefacts have been unearthed to date. The archaeological work is being carried out by the Ministry of Culture and Sports' Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities and the Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. In popular culture Construction delays have made the Thessaloniki Metro the subject of a number of jokes in Greece. News satire websites such as have satirised the metro on numerous occasions with stories such as \\"Thessaloniki Metro will operate on a 24-hour basis during the Christmas rush\\" and \\"Thessaloniki Metro enters its 763rd day of strike\\", and it has been cited in satirical lyrics by the Greek rapper Tus. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras joked about the delays at the 2018 Thessaloniki International Fair: \\"What's happening with the metro, guys? Will it get built here?\\" See also * List of metro systems * Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization * Athens Metro References = Sources = * Archived information * Thessaloniki Metro and the Athens Metro Extensions (Greek Ministry of Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works press release 2006-02-20) * Conclusion of contract for the Thessaloniki metro (Greek Ministry of Environment, Physical Planning and Public Works press release 2006-04-07) External links * Attiko Metro SA Thessaloniki Metro ** Maps Thessaloniki (regional unit) Rapid transit in Greece Electric railways in Greece Underground rapid transit in Greece Proposed public transport in Europe Transport in Thessaloniki 2023 in rail transport ","title":"Thessaloniki Metro"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",H,[(t(!0),n(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",I]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/60.md","filePath":"library/60.md"}'),L={name:"library/60.md"},D=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{E as __pageData,D as default};
