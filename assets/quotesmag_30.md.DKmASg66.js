The second and fourth stories have comic undertones. The first and final stories feature cafe musicians, and the first and fourth stories feature the same character. All five stories have unreliable male narrators and are written in the first person. * \\"Crooner\\" ** Set in Venice, a fading American singer co-opts a Polish cafe musician into accompanying him while he serenades his wife (whose relationship is disintegrating) from a gondola. * \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" ** In London, an expatriate EFL teacher is invited to the home of a couple whom he knew whilst at university.

Plot summary  The central character of the novel is Eugene Wren, a wealthy, middle-aged art dealer whose secretive personality jeopardizes both his sanity and his relationship with, and eventual engagement to, Ella Cotswold, an attractive general practitioner ten years his junior. Having in the past overcome various slight addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and food, Wren gets hooked on a special brand of sugar-free sweet, which he wants to conceal from his fiancée. When the couple decide that Ella should sell her flat and she moves in with him, he starts inventing excuses and lies so as to be alone just for the time it takes to suck a sweet and to get rid of the sweet smell on his breath afterwards. Extremely ashamed of his habit, he buys, hoards, and consumes the sweets secretly, and he establishes several caches in his antique-studded home. When Ella happens to find one of them, out of curiosity goes on to search the rest of the house, and finally confronts Wren with her find, he is so ashamed of himself that he sees no other way than to break off their engagement and move into a hotel.

He is best known for his role as a co-instigator and prosecutor in the 1925 trial of John T. Scopes, a Dayton, Tennessee teacher accused of teaching the Theory of Evolution in violation of Tennessee state law. Hicks may have also been the inspiration for the Shel Silverstein song \\"A Boy Named Sue,\\" which was popularized by Johnny Cash in 1969. Life and legal career Hicks was born in Madisonville, Tennessee on December 12, 1895. He was the youngest child of Charles Wesley and Susanna Coltharp Hicks. Hicks was named \\"Sue\\" after his mother, who died shortly after giving birth to him. Charles Wesley Hicks, Sue's father, was a prominent Madisonville lawyer, and Wesley J. Hicks, Sue's great-uncle, was the author of a manual on Tennessee Chancery law practice and played a key role in getting lawsuits dismissed against former Confederate officers in the Knoxville area after the American Civil War. Hicks trained at Hiwassee College and the University of Kentucky before joining his older brother, Herbert, in Dayton, where Herbert had been appointed acting Rhea County attorney.Charles Wesley Hicks, \\"My Day and Locality ,\\" 1916. Transcribed for the web by Barbara Ribling, 2004. Retrieved: December 5, 2008. In Dayton, the Hicks brothers were regulars at the F.E. Robinson Drugstore, where the town's professionals often gathered to socialize and discuss issues of the day. In May 1925, the Hicks brothers and other regulars became involved in a discussion over an American Civil Liberties Union advertisement seeking a challenge to the Butler Act, a recently-enacted state law barring the teaching of the Theory of Evolution. Realizing the publicity such a case would bring to Rhea County, the group -- who would eventually become known as the \\"drugstore conspirators\\" -- decided to engineer a case that would test the constitutionality of the Butler Act. The group recruited local physics teacher John T. Scopes -- a friend of Sue's -- to admit to teaching the Theory of Evolution. One of the conspirators, George Rappleyea, swore out a warrant for Scopes' arrest on May 5, and charges were filed the following day.Marcel LaFollette, Reframing Scopes: Journalists, Scientists, and Lost Photographs from the Trial of the Century (Lawrence, Kan.: University Press of Kansas, 2008), 5-10. Sue Hicks served as a member of the Scopes Trial prosecution team, although his role was overshadowed by the presence of William Jennings Bryan, an activist and former presidential candidate who had been invited to join the team as a special prosecutor. While the trial was successful in bringing publicity to Rhea County, much of the publicity was negative, and portrayed local residents as backward and uneducated. Although Scopes was convicted -- as had been planned -- the \\"test case\\" came to an end in 1927, when the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled the Butler Act constitutional, but overturned Scopes' conviction on a technicality. This kept the case out of the federal court system and ended any chance of it proceeding to the United States Supreme Court, which the drugstore conspirators had originally hoped.George Webb, \\"The Scopes Trial.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: December 5, 2008.Michael Birdwell, \\"Tennessee In Film.\\" The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: December 7, 2008. Hicks later wrote the following about his views on the trial: > We cannot speak other than with commendation as to the conduct of Judge > Raulston in the Scopes Case. It was a very trying case. Religious fanatics, > reds, and all manner of rabble were assembled at this trial, and at times > the excitement of the crowd became almost a frenzy, and almost beyond the > control of the small number of officers which we had at our disposal. Beside > the attorneys for the defense did every thing they could to provoke the > Court and to get on the front pages of the newspapers as much as they could, > so the situation was very hard to handle. Between 1936 and 1958, Hicks served as a state circuit court judge, and continued to serve in a reserve status until the 1970s. He presided over more than 800 murder cases, and gained a reputation for being \\"fair\\" and \\"tough\\".Richard Urban, \\"Ultimate Penalty -- The Story of William Tines, Tennessee's Last Dead Man Walking .\\" November 14, 1996. Retrieved: December 5, 2008. In the mid-1960s, Hicks served as president of the Fort Loudoun Association, and led the early opposition to the Tennessee Valley Authority's plans to build Tellico Dam at the mouth of the Little Tennessee River.Kenneth Murchison, The Snail Darter Case: TVA Versus the Endangered Species Act (Lawrence Kan.: University Press of Kansas, 2007), p. 20. Hicks died on June 27, 1980 in Sweetwater, Tennessee. He is buried at Haven Hill Memorial Gardens in Madisonville. The Sue K. Hicks Papers, which consist primarily of Hicks's correspondence regarding the Scopes Trial and later legal cases, are on file at the University of Tennessee Special Collections Library in Knoxville. Inspiration for \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" Hicks's oddly feminine first name may have inspired the song, \\"A Boy Named Sue\\", which Johnny Cash first performed in 1969. The song's author, Shel Silverstein, attended a judicial conference in Gatlinburg, Tennessee--at which Hicks was a speaker--and apparently got the idea for the song title after hearing Hicks introduced. While Cash said he was unaware that Silverstein had any one person in mind when he wrote the song, he did send Hicks two records and two autographed pictures with the inscription, \\"To Sue, how do you do?\\" While his name may have inspired the song's title, Hicks pointed out that the character in the song's lyrics--who seeks revenge against his father after a lifetime of teasing--bore little resemblance to his own life. Hicks's father named him after his deceased mother, who had died from complications with Hicks's birth, rather than, as the song suggests, to make him \\"strong\\". Hicks also claimed to have always had a sense of humor about his name, and did not consider it a source of derision. In 1970, Hicks noted: \\"It is an irony of fate that I have tried over 800 murder cases and thousands of others, but the most publicity has been from the name 'Sue' and from the evolution trial. ... I was named Sue for my mother, who died after childbirth.\\" See also *Ray Jenkins *John Randolph Neal Jr. References External links *Scopes Trial: A Creation and Science History Project -- trial transcript *Sue K Hicks Papers, University of Tennessee Knoxville Libraries * Tennessee state court judges People from Madisonville, Tennessee 1895 births 1980 deaths University of Kentucky alumni 20th-century American judges ","title":"Sue K.

It was published posthumously in Swedish in 2006 and in English in January 2009. The book features many of the characters who appeared in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2005), among them the title character, Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant computer hacker and social misfit, and Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist and publisher of Millennium magazine. Widely seen as a critical success, The Girl Who Played with Fire was also (according to The Bookseller magazine) the first and only translated novel to be number one in the UK hardback chart. Synopsis The novel is formally divided into a prologue followed by four parts. The prologue of the book opens with a girl captured and restrained inside a dark room by an unidentified male. To cope with being captured, she mentally replays a past episode when she threw a milk carton filled with gasoline onto another man inside a car and tossed an ignited match onto him. = Part 1 – Irregular Equations = After finishing the job on the Wennerström affair (described in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Lisbeth Salander disappeared from Sweden and traveled throughout Europe. The novel opens with her on the shores of the Caribbean in St George's, the capital of Grenada. Salander has become interested in Fermat's Last Theorem and mathematics, an interest that resounds with the opening page of each Part in this novel. From within her room in her hotel she observes on several occasions that her neighbor, Dr Forbes, an American tourist from Texas, physically abuses his wife, in the next room to Salander's. Salander also befriends George Bland, a 16-year-old orphaned student living in a small shack and begins tutoring him in mathematics. Salander finds Bland's company relaxing and enjoyable because Bland does not ask her personal questions, and the two develop a sexual relationship. Salander uses her connections among the hackers' network to investigate Dr Forbes and learns that he was once accused of mishandling funds in his faith-based foundation. Currently he has no assets, but his wife is the heiress to a fortune worth $40 million. As a hurricane hits Grenada, concerns for the safety of the residents at the hotel cause the hotel management to begin ushering them into a cellar. Salander remembers Bland, and braves the strong wind and rain to collect him. As the two reach the hotel entrance, Salander sees Dr Forbes on the beach with his wife and realizes that he is attempting to kill her for her inheritance. Salander attacks Forbes with the leg of a chair and abandons him to the elements. Salander, Bland, and Mrs Forbes retreat to the cellar and receive medical care; Dr Forbes is later confirmed as the only fatality of the storm. = Part 2 – From Russia with Love = Lisbeth Salander returns to Stockholm after more than a year's absence. Immediately before the Wennerström affair became public knowledge, Salander had laundered a sum of three billion kronor (the equivalent of about half a billion $US) into a disguised bank account. With this sum she purchases a new upscale apartment outside Mosebacke Torg and moves out of her old apartment in Lundagatan (SV). Salander allows her current sex partner, Miriam Wu, to move into her old apartment, for the price of 1 krona and the condition that Wu forward all of Salander's mail. Salander also re-establishes contact with Dragan Armansky, her former boss at Milton Securities, and her former legal guardian Holger Palmgren, who fell victim to a stroke at the beginning of Dragon Tattoo. Nils Bjurman, Palmgren's replacement, continues to nurture a growing hatred for his ward after the events of Dragon Tattoo. His fury has caused him to diminish his practice down to a single client (Salander) and focus his attention on capturing her and destroying the film she made of him raping her. He scrutinizes Salander's medical records, and thus identifies an incident named \\"All the Evil\\" as well as a person from her past as his strongest ally. In the meantime, Mikael Blomkvist, the publisher of Millennium magazine, has lost contact with Salander, who has refused even to open his letters. He is therefore surprised, shortly after her return, while he is walking past Salander's apartment in the vain hope of running into her, to see her being attacked by a ponytailed man with a beer gut, a member of the Svavelsjö outlaw motorcycle club. Blomkvist attempts to help, to Salander's astonishment, and their joint efforts enable her to elude her attacker. Millennium is approached by a couple: Dag Svensson, a young journalist, and Mia Johansson, a doctoral student. They have put together a meticulously researched report, ironically titled \\"From Russia with Love\\", about sex trafficking in Sweden and the abuse of underage girls by high-ranking figures; this is the subject of Johansson's doctoral thesis and Svensson wants Millennium to publish his exposé in book form. Whilst the research is mostly complete, Svensson, Johansson, and the Millennium staff are intrigued by recurring mentions of \\"Zala\\", a shadowy figure heavily involved in Sweden's sex-trafficking industry. Salander, hacking Mikael Blomkvist's computer, is taken aback by the mention of Zala, and visits Svensson and Johansson to ask questions. = Part 3 – Absurd Equations = Later the same night, Blomkvist calls on the couple, and finds them both shot dead in their apartment, the killer having apparently left the building only seconds before. Blomkvist notifies Erika Berger, the Millenniums editor-in-chief and his lover, of the double murder, and the magazine's management team holds an emergency meeting at which they decide to postpone the publication of Svensson's book and the associated magazine special. They decide to backtrack Svensson's research to ensure the accuracy of the material, and to comb through it for possible murder motives, while Blomkvist is tasked with finishing Svensson's mostly-completed book. Prosecutor Richard Ekström assembles an investigative team, led by Inspector Jan Bublanski, who selects Sonja Modig for inclusion in the team because of her sensitivity to women's issues. The team identifies Salander's fingerprints on the murder weapon, and her formal record establishes her as a violent, unstable, psychotic young woman with a history of prostitution. Armansky, Blomkvist, and Berger all vouch for Salander's intelligence and moral fiber; neither Blomkvist nor Berger was even aware of her psychiatric history. While investigating Salander's social circle, Modig finds Bjurman shot dead in his apartment with his own revolver, the same weapon used on Svensson and Johansson; Salander remains the prime suspect. In light of this new evidence, Ekström holds a press conference and discloses Salander's name and psychiatric history to the press, describing her as a danger to others and herself. Blomkvist enlists the help of managing editor Malin Eriksson to investigate the murders, during which investigation Blomkvist realizes that Salander has hacked into his notebook computer. He leaves her notes on his desktop, and her replies point him to \\"Zala\\". Blomkvist confronts Gunnar Björck, a policeman on sick leave and one of the high-ranking abusers identified by Dag and Mia, who agrees to disclose information about Zala if Blomkvist leaves him out of Millennium's exposé. Armansky realises that Milton Security should become involved in the investigation and sends two of his employees, Hedström and Bohman, to aid the formal police investigation. Miriam Wu returns from a Paris trip to find herself taken to the police station, and she confirms Salander's intelligence and moral character. However, Hedström, who carries an old grudge against Salander, leaks Wu's identity to the press, who publish stories about Wu's involvement in a Gay Pride Festival and Salander's prior friendship with a female rock group; both Wu and Salander are sensationalized in the media as members of a \\"lesbian Satanist gang\\". The press also publishes information about Salander's past. = Part 4 – Terminator = Part 4 begins with Salander's wondering why the press's inside source has chosen not to publicize \\"All the Evil\\", the events which dominated the gap in her biography, information she knows would swing public opinion even further against her. Blomkvist is approached by Paolo Roberto, a boxing champion and Salander's former coach. Blomkvist asks Roberto to help by finding Miriam Wu, who, released by the police, has been avoiding all contact from the press, including Blomkvist. In the meantime, at Salander's suggestion, Blomkvist focuses on Zala as the key connection among the three murders and the sex trafficking. As the police continue the investigation, Blomkvist's team also notices the three-year gap in Salander's biography. Blomkvist decides to confront Björck and trade his anonymity for information on Zala. Roberto, staking out Salander's former apartment in the hopes of catching Wu, witnesses her being kidnapped into a van by a paunchy man with a ponytail (Salander's earlier attacker) and a \\"blond giant\\". He follows the van to a warehouse south of Nykvarn, where he attempts to rescue Wu by boxing with the giant. He finds his opponent unusually muscular and totally insensitive to pain, and only through applications of massive blunt trauma can he and Wu stun the giant enough to escape. The giant recovers and sets the warehouse on fire to destroy the evidence. However, Roberto is able to direct the police to the site, where they find three buried and dismembered bodies. Visiting Bjurman's summer cabin, Salander finds a classified Swedish Security Service file written about \\"All The Evil\\", and begins to make the connection between Bjurman and Zala, whose real name is Alexander Zalachenko. By coincidence, two members of Svavelsjö MC, Carl-Magnus Lundin (the paunchy ponytailed man) and Sonny Nieminen, have been dispatched to burn the place down. Salander physically incapacitates them, leaving more suspects for Bublanski to find. She returns to her apartment and, having no choice, decides to find Zalachenko and kill him. Salander discovers the blond giant's identity (\\"Ronald Niedermann\\") and his connection to a post office box in Göteborg, and she goes there to find him and Zalachenko. In his apartment, Blomkvist finds Salander's keys, which he had picked up after her escape from Lundin. He manages to find her new, upscale apartment as well as the DVD revealing Bjurman's crime. With information from Björck and Salander's former guardian, Holger Palmgren, Blomkvist is able to piece together the entire story: Zalachenko is a former Soviet defector under secret Swedish protection, whose very existence is kept classified by Säpo; Bjurman and Björck knew about him only because they happened to be the junior officers on duty the day Zalachenko went into a police station and demanded political asylum. Zalachenko, initially a source of vital information on the USSR's intelligence operations to Säpo, began to traffic in sex slaves on the side. He became the partner of a 17-year-old woman who became pregnant with twins, Lisbeth and Camilla. Zalachenko was an itinerant father who physically and emotionally abused his partner when he was home. The cycle of violence culminated in Lisbeth Salander's deliberately setting his car alight with gasoline while her father was in it. This is the event Salander refers to as \\"All the Evil\\", since the authorities, instead of listening to her pleas on behalf of her mother, imprisoned Salander and declared her insane. Salander's mother was left with the first of a series of cerebral hemorrhages which consigned her to nursing homes and ultimately caused her death. Salander realised that the government would never acknowledge Zalachenko's crimes, which would require them to admit his existence. Zalachenko was allowed to walk away, but suffered serious injuries and had to have his foot amputated. Niedermann had killed Svensson and Johansson on Zalachenko's orders: when Salander visited them, she asked whether Bjurman had ever appeared on their list of high-ranking abusers, and they called him immediately after she left. Bjurman then called Zalachenko in a panic, leading not only to their deaths but to his own, as well. Blomkvist does not share all of his findings with Bublanski, out of respect for Salander's privacy, but between his testimony, the various character witnesses, and the additional accomplices piling up, the police are forced to admit that their original suspicions of Salander as a psychotic murderer may have been wrong. Milton Security are ejected from the investigation when it becomes clear that Hedström is the inside source who has been leaking sensational details to the press. Armansky is satisfied, as his true goal in aiding the investigation—ensuring Salander is not simply condemned as a murderer out of hand—has been achieved. Finally, Blomkvist finds Niedermann's Göteborg address, and sets off for the farm where Niedermann and Zalachenko await. He has deduced that Salander has entered what Roberto and his boxing friends called \\"Terminator Mode\\", where she attacks without restraint to defend her life and those she cares about. Salander enters the farmhouse and is captured as a result of secret cameras and alarms Zalachenko had installed. Zalachenko tells Salander that Niedermann is her half-brother. When Salander attempts to escape, Zalachenko shoots her in the hip, shoulder, and head, and Niedermann buries her, not realising she is still alive. Battling through immense pain, Salander slowly digs herself out and again attempts to kill Zalachenko with an axe, noting that Zalachenko's use of a Browning .22 firearm is the only reason she survived. On his way to Göteborg, Blomkvist sees Niedermann trying to hitch a ride, captures him at gunpoint, and ties him against a signpost by the road. The book ends as Blomkvist finds Salander and calls emergency services.

It received generally positive reviews from most of the major UK newspapers. Many reviewers agreed with Joan Smith at The Sunday Times that this novel was “even more gripping and astonishing than the first”. Most of the reviewers concentrated mainly on the character of Lisbeth Salander, with Mark Lawson at the Guardian saying that \\"the huge pleasure of these books is Salander, a fascinating creation with a complete and complex psychology.\\" Boyd Tonkin in The Independent said: \\"the spiky and sassy Lisbeth Salander – punkish wild child, traumatised survivor of the 'care' system, sexual adventurer and computer hacker of genius\\" was \\"the most original heroine to emerge in crime fiction for many years\\". Michiko Kakutani at The New York Times wrote that \\"Salander and Blomkvist, transcend their genre and insinuate themselves in the reader’s mind through their oddball individuality, their professional competence and, surprisingly, their emotional vulnerability.\\" Cultural notes The character of Paolo Roberto is an actual person. He is a former boxer and television chef who has also dabbled in politics. He played himself in the 2009 film adaptation of the book. In the first part of the book, Salander is exploring Dimensions in Mathematics apparently written by L. C. Parnault and published by Harvard University Press in 1999. On February 9, 2009, Harvard University Press announced on their website that this book and the author are purely fictitious. The mysterious Karl Axel Bodin, in whose house Salander finds Zalachenko and Niedermann, is a historical name. Bodin was born in Karlstad and later moved to Sundsvall. He went to Norway to join the Waffen-SS; at the end of World War II, he was attached to the country's branch of the Gestapo. At the war's end, Bodin and another Swedish volunteer stole a car in an attempted escape to Sweden. The car's owner saw the theft, and soon a gunfight erupted in which the car owner and Bodin's friend were shot. Bodin left his friend behind and crossed the border.

He helped chart the northern coasts of Canada. He died by violence near the Turtle River while traveling through the wilderness in what is now the U.S. state of North Dakota, but was then part of the Territory of Iowa. The circumstances of his final hours—in which he allegedly killed himself after gunning down two companions—have long been a subject of controversy.  Early life  Simpson was born in Dingwall, Ross-shire, Scotland, the son of magistrate Alexander Simpson (1751–1821), a schoolteacher, by his second wife Mary, who had helped raise George Simpson. Thomas had a half-brother, Aemilius, and a full brother, Alexander.THOMAS Retrieved on 20 Jan 2018 He was a sickly and timid youth, avoiding rough sport. After his father's death the family ended up in financial distress, but despite this he was given a proper education. Simpson was educated with a view to his becoming a clergyman, and was sent to King's College, Aberdeen, at the age of 17\\\\. He performed quite well and had been given the Huttonian prize, the highest award at the college, by the end of his fourth year. Sir George Simpson, his cousin, offered him a position in the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826, which he declined in order to complete his studies. He graduated in 1828, at the age of 20, with a Master of Arts degree. He enrolled in a divinity class that winter with the goal of becoming a clergyman when the offer of a position in the Hudson's Bay Company was again extended, and this time he accepted. By his own confession he had \\"a little of the spirit of contradiction and an unwillingness to be led.\\" In 1829, Simpson arrived in Norway House to join the Hudson's Bay Company as George's secretary. He was quite ambitious and in a letter to his brother stated that his talents would lead him to speedy advancement. He was stationed at the Red River Colony in the 1830s, serving as second officer to chief factor Alexander Christie.  Arctic exploration  From 1836 to 1839, Simpson was involved in an expedition to chart the Arctic coast of Canada in order to fill two gaps left by other expeditions in search of the Northwest Passage. The expedition was headed by Peter Warren Dease, a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Thomas was the junior officer but Dease ceded most of the responsibility to him. Several writersGlyn Williams, \\"Arctic Labyrinth\\", 2008, chapter 14Anthony Brandt,\\"The Man Who Ate His Boots\\", Chapter 15 present Simpson as an ambitious and over-confident young man, whereas Dease was 20 years older, experienced in Arctic travel, and efficient but perhaps under- confident. Ten more men went with them, including the canoemen James McKay and George Sinclair who had traveled with George Back during his 1834 journey down the Back River. The expedition was organized by the Hudson's Bay Company rather than the Royal Navy, which sponsored most of the Northwest Passage exploration. They were to descend the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean, turn west, and close the gap between John Franklin's 1826 furthest-west and Frederick William Beechey's furthest-east at Point Barrow. The next summer they were to go down the Coppermine River, repeat Franklin's 1821 route east to Cape Turnagain and continue along the unknown coast at least to the mouth of the Back River, which had been reached overland in 1834. They spent the winter of 1836 at Fort Chipewyan, where they built two boats. The party left on 1 June, and a month later reached the mouth of the Great Bear River. There they detached four men to go upriver to the Great Bear Lake and build winter quarters at Fort Confidence while the rest went down the Mackenzie to the Arctic, which they reached on 9 July. They then traveled west along the coast past Franklin's Return Reef until they were blocked by ice at Boat Extreme, about east of Point Barrow. Simpson and five men continued on foot and reached Point Barrow on 4 August. They returned to Fort Confidence on 25 September. At this point the north coast had been mapped from the Bering Strait to the mouth of the Coppermine. Early in the year, Simpson went overland to find the upper Coppermine River. In the summer, they descended the Coppermine, which was full of meltwater, and reached the still-frozen Arctic. They waited two weeks for the ice to clear and began working slowly east. On 20 August they were blocked by ice a few miles from Franklin's Point Turnagain on the Kent Peninsula. Dease stayed behind with the boats and Simpson walked about east to a place he called Point Alexander.\\"Peter Warren Dease\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online gives of coast but the Kent Peninsula is not quite that long and the coast is not much indented.Derek Hayes' Historical Atlas of the Arctic, p. 80, gives his turning point as the Beaufort River two days beyond Cape Alexander, but what is now called the Beaufort River is west of Cape Alexander. To the north he saw and named Victoria Land. To the east he saw open water in Queen Maud Gulf. He returned to Dease and the frozen-in boats. A few days later the ice suddenly cleared and they had an easy sail back to the Coppermine. They had gone only a little further than Franklin. It was a better year for ice. They followed the same route, passed Point Turnagain and Cape Alexander, sailed for the first time the Dease Strait and the Queen Maud Gulf, found the Adelaide Peninsula and Simpson Strait to its north and reached Chantry Inlet where McKay and Sinclair had been in 1834. At Montreal Island, they found a cache left by George Back in 1834. Leaving Chantry Inlet they were struck by a gale that lasted four days. Fifty miles northeast they turned back at the Castor and Pollux River. Returning, they followed the south shore of King William Island to a point they called Cape Hershel, where the coast turned north, then followed the south shore of Queen Maud Gulf and the south shore of Victoria Island. It had been the longest boat voyage ever made in Canadian Arctic waters. At this point the entire Arctic coast had been roughly mapped from the Bering Strait to beyond Chantry Inlet. The remaining problems were the possibility of a water route from Chantry Inlet to the Gulf of Boothia and the huge rectangular area north of the coast and south of the Parry Channel. The party returned to the Great Slave Lake in September of that year, and from there Thomas drew up a letter to the directors of the Hudson's Bay Company describing the results of the expedition, which was published in many newspapers of the day. He also transmitted a plan for an expedition to complete further exploration of the coast between the Fury and Hecla Strait and the eastern limits of his previous explorations. To attend to preparations for this new expedition, Simpson immediately left for the Red River Colony, making the entire journey in 61 days, arriving on 2 February 1840. The annual canoes from Canada to the settlement in June of that year brought no word of the reception of his exploits, or authorization to continue exploration, as word had not reached England in time to reply at that opportunity. Without authorization from the Directors, Thomas had no authority to arrange another expedition. Instead of waiting for an entire year for word, he decided to return to Britain in person.  Death and investigation  Thomas left the Red River Colony on 6 June 1840, intending to travel south to the Minnesota River, in the United States, where he would embark on a voyage that would eventually take him to England. He initially set out with a group of settlers and Métis, but soon left the main party with four Métis traveling companions in order to make better time. On 14 June 1840, Simpson and two of his companions were fatally shot at a wilderness camp in the Territory of Iowa – in what is now the state of North Dakota. According to the two survivors, Simpson had become increasingly anxious and even deranged during the trip, finally accusing two of the party of plotting to kill him. He shot them, and the witnesses fled, returning to the larger party, a portion of which then went to Simpson's encampment. They found him dead of gunshot wounds, his shotgun beside him. Witness depositions agreed that Simpson shot John Bird dead and mortally wounded Antoine Legros (dit Lecomte) Senior. Legros Junior and James Bruce then fled to the main party. When the posse reached the site they found Legros Sr. dead but Simpson still alive. Five minutes later Simpson was dead. All involved said that the wound was self-inflicted. The investigation that was conducted by U.S. territorial authorities was based on witness depositions submitted in various locations. The authorities ruled the deaths a case of murder-suicide. Bruce's deposition claimed that Simpson told him he killed the two men because they intended to \\"murder him on that night for his papers.\\" Those papers were later sent to his cousin, Sir George Simpson. Three years later, when Sir George sent the papers to Thomas' younger brother Alexander, the diary and all correspondence between Sir George and Thomas were missing. What the missing papers may have contained remains unknown. In the meantime, after Simpson's death, the company's directors in London had sent permission for him to continue with his explorations. He had also been awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Medal, and the British government had announced its intention of granting him a pension of £100 a year. Instead, being accused of murder and suicide, and being disgraced in the eyes of the church, Thomas was buried in an unmarked grave in Canada. = Continuing controversy = Simpson's brother Alexander published Narrative of the Discoveries on the North Coast of America, written by Thomas, in 1843, and later himself wrote The Life and Times of Thomas Simpson, published in 1845, in which he examined the possibility that Simpson's traveling companions had planned to steal his notes and maps, which they could have sold to the Hudson's Bay Company’s American rivals, and that Simpson was a victim of homicide. A number of scholars have studied the evidence in Simpson's death without reaching a conclusion.James Raffan, \\"Emperor of the North: Sir George Simpson.. etc\\", chapter 15 The three main competing views of the case have been: the official finding, that a deranged Simpson murdered two of his companions and then killed himself; the conspiracy theory, that Simpson's companions murdered him, perhaps for his papers, and then covered up the crime; and the shootout theory, that Simpson attacked his companions, killing two, but was then shot by the others, who invented the suicide story because they feared Simpson's prominence might lead to charges against them. Famed explorer and historian Vilhjalmur Stefansson included the Simpson case in his 1938 book Unsolved Mysteries of the Arctic. He found the official story, based on witnesses' depositions, to be unconvincing though not impossible. Stefansson and other historians have noted that the official investigation was far from thorough, perhaps because of the remote location of the deaths.

The gallery period The New Gallery was founded in 1888 by J. Comyns Carr and Charles Edward Hallé. Carr and Hallé had been co-directors of Sir Coutts Lindsay's Grosvenor Gallery, but resigned from that troubled gallery in 1887. The building was designed by Edward Robert Robson FSA, and constructed in little more than three months to ensure that it could open in the summer of 1888.Blackburn, Henry: New Gallery Notes No. 1 (May 1888, Chatto and Windus) Retrieved 2008-12-07Wildman, Stephen: Edward Burne-Jones: Victorian Artist-Dreamer, pages 33, 198, 268 & 319, (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998) The gallery was built on the site of an old fruit market. Existing cast-iron columns supporting the roof were encased with marble to give the impression of \\"massive marble shafts\\" topped with gilded Greek capitals. The architrave, frieze, and cornices above the columns were covered with platinum leaf. At the opening, the West and North Galleries on the ground floor were devoted to oil paintings, and the first floor balcony around the Central Hall displayed smaller works in oils, watercolours, etchings and drawings. Sculpture was displayed in the Central Hall itself. Artists and exhibitions The New Gallery continued the ideals of the Grosvenor, and was an important venue for Pre-Raphaelite and Aesthetic movement artists. Edward Burne-Jones, then at the height of his popularity, supported the new venture, serving on its Consulting Committee and lending three large oils for the opening, thus ensuring its financial success. Lawrence Alma-Tadema and William Holman Hunt also joined the Consulting Committee, and George Frederic Watts and Lord Leighton transferred their loyalty to the New Gallery. The private view of the first exhibition was held on Tuesday, 8 May 1888, and the exhibition opened to the public on Wednesday, 9 May, for three months. The private view was a great social success, with former Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone among the early arrivals. In October and November 1888, the New Gallery hosted the first showcase of industrial and applied arts by the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society under the direction of its founding president, illustrator and designer Walter Crane.Parry, Linda, William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook, pages 12-13 (Portland House, 1989) No attempt had been made to show contemporary decorative arts in London since the Grosvenor Gallery's Winter Exhibition of 1881, which included cartoons for mosaic, tapestry, and glass, and the Society's annual (later triennial) exhibitions at the New Gallery were important events in the Arts and Crafts Movement at the end of the 19th century.Crane, Walter: Of the Arts and Crafts Movement (George Bell & Sons, 1905) Accessed 2008-12-09Parry, Linda: Textiles of the Arts & Crafts Movement, pages 71, 76 & 89 (Thames and Hudson, revised edition 2005) In 1890, the New Gallery held an important exhibition of Tudor portraits and relics under the auspices of Queen Victoria.Exhibition of the Royal House of Tudor: The New Gallery (London: R. Clay, 1890) Accessed 2017-11-23 The New Gallery was the setting for a major Burne-Jones retrospective in 1892–93 and a memorial exhibition of his works in 1898. In 1893 the New Gallery exposed for the first time four panels by Masaccio, later attributed to the Pisa Polyptych (now in Staatliche Museen, Berlin).John T. Spike: Masaccio (Rizzoli libri illustrati, Milano 2002) Carr continued as co-director until 1908. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1910 was the last to be held at the New Gallery.  Later uses for the building  In 1910, the interior was converted into The New Gallery Restaurant, but it was converted again in January 1913, this time to a cinema. Enlargement and modifications were made to the cinema in 1925, including the installation of a Wurlitzer organ. It was the location of the UK showing of the first full-length animated cartoon, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1938. After World War II the cinema struggled, partly because it was slightly off-West End, and the then owners, Gaumont British Theatres. sold the lease to the Seventh-day Adventist Church and was used as a church from 1953 until the 1990s, although the cinema was occasionally used for religious films. It remained empty until 2006, when it became a Habitat furniture store. The Wurlitzer organ remained in place and was restored to its original condition. Habitat surrendered the lease in March 2011, and in September 2012 the site become a flagship store for Burberry. The New Gallery became a Grade II Listed building in 1992.

He is best remembered for the heritage conservation works he carried out on historical sites during his long-time post as director general of the Touring and Automobile Club of Turkey (TTOK). He was born in Hakkâri, the south easternmost city of Turkey as his father was on duty as a gendarmerie officer. The family moved to Istanbul in 1933. After completing his primary, secondary and high school education in Istanbul, Çelik Gülersoy attended Istanbul University and graduated from the Law School. Following his military service between 1959–1960, he was employed in 1961 by the TTOK as law consultant, where he had worked already at various posts since 1947. In 1966, Çelik Gülersoy became the director general of the TTOK, a position he held 38 years long until his death. Reorganizing the TTOK, he brought in many much-needed services. He contributed to tourism and attended traffic conferences and congresses abroad. He published numerous books on historic sites mainly in Istanbul, and contributed so to the redevelopment of the cultural and touristic places. Çelik Gülersoy died on July 6, 2003 due to pancreas cancer during a classical music concert he attended at the Fabiato Mansion in Büyükada. He was buried next to his mother's grave at Demirciköy Cemetery in Sarıyer following a funeral service held at the Teşvikiye Mosque. He lived alone and left all his assets to the Çelik Gülersoy Foundation he had established.

In the collection of the National Galleries of Scotland. The vault of Sir John Medina, Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh Sir John Baptist Medina or John Baptiste de Medina (1659 - 5 October 1710)Getty Name List – and variants, sometimes spelled \\"Baptiste\\", and \\"de Medina\\", but always \\"John\\" was an artist of Flemish-Spanish origin who worked in England and Scotland, mostly as a portrait painter, though he was also the first illustrator of Paradise Lost by John Milton in 1688.Behrendt, 91 Life and portrait-painting Medina was the son of a Spanish army captain posted to Brussels, where he was born and later trained by François Duchatel, before coming to London in 1686 and setting up his studio in Drury Lane. Even in London he seems to have specialized in Scottish sitters, and in either 1688-89 or 1694 he moved to Edinburgh,The earlier date per Waterhouse, 150, the later per the NGS where he remained for the rest of his life. He was encouraged and sponsored by the Earl of Melville, who he painted in London. From 1689 Melville, like many of Medina's subjects a strong Whig, was Secretary of State for Scotland, effectively running the country for the King in London. With little competition, Medina was the most prominent Scottish portraitist for the rest of his life, charging £5 for a head and £10 for a half-length. His best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh; these are invariably compared to the Kit Cat Club series in London by Sir Godfrey Kneller.Waterhouse, 150-51 His style follows the conventions of Kneller, but his portraits are often more relaxed and informal, favouring relatively bright blues and rose-reds in the clothing, and dark backgrounds. The quality of the painting can vary considerably, probably reflecting the use of his assistants. In 1706 he was knighted, one of the last batch of Scottish knights to be created before the Acts of Union 1707. Medina died in Edinburgh on 5 October 1710. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in the centre of the city.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 The grave is a solid enclosed vault on the east side, now appearing half- sunken, adjacent to the steps leading to the northern section. The engraver, William Howison, is buried in front of the vault. He trained both his own son and the talented William Aikman, the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation.Waterhouse, 151 The Scottish National Portrait Gallery has a representative ten works, including another self-portrait,National Galleries of Scotland and most of his paintings remain in Scotland – there are none, for example, in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Illustrations to Paradise Lost Although he appears to have painted other types of work than portraits, the only works other than portraits known to survive are his eight (out of a total of twelve plates prefacing each book of the poem) engraved book illustrations for the fourth edition, the first to be illustrated, of Paradise Lost by John Milton, published in London by Jacob Tonson in 1688. Though they have been described, perhaps rather unfairly, as \\"stiff and archaic\\", these follow Milton's text carefully, unlike those of the artists used for the other prints, and usually include several different episodes in each illustration. Appropriately, Medina drew on traditional Biblical iconography, carefully and imaginatively adapting it to fit Milton's text. Medina's designs preface Books 3 and 5 to 11; the plates were engraved from his designs by a specialist, Michael Burghers (also Burgese or Burgess), a Flemish engraver working in Oxford, who signed all but one plate as the engraver.Behrendt, 91-2 All the illustrations are online from Christ's Collecge, Cambridge . This source gives Medina only 7 of the 12. They were still being used, in rather worn-out condition, for the sixth edition of 1695. The exact authorship of some plates is a matter of dispute. Purely based on the interpretation of a hand-written note attributed to Horace Walpole in the New York City Public Library copy of the book, Henry Aldrich, an Oxford don of diverse talents, but not otherwise known as an artist, has been identified as the unknown artist of some plates, usually Books I, II and XII. Bernard Lens II, otherwise known as a painter of enamels, is signed as the artist for Book IV, and Medina is signed as the artist for one more plate than some say would seem likely to be his on stylistic grounds.Miner, pp. 421-2, and following pages for commentary on the images.

It serves all metalcasting industry producers, suppliers, and end users, including all metals and all processes. The organization traces its roots to 1896 when the American Foundrymen's Association was formed. The Association was subsequently named The American Foundrymen's Society, and later the name was adjusted to the American Foundry Society, or AFS. The society is considered an international organization consisting of 7,500 members across 48 countries, organized into 40 regional chapters and 40 student chapters in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The AFS promotes the interests of the foundry industry to the federal government and consists of a professional staff of 33 persons and volunteer committee structure of approximately 1,000 volunteers. The six major areas of focus are: Member Success and Sustainability; Industry Stewardship; Policy Advocacy; Promotion of Castings; Workforce Development; and Technical Innovation. AFS develops and funds research to address metalcasting technical needs. The organization also maintains a Washington DC office and advocates for public policies conducive to a strong metalcasting industry. The AFS Institute, formerly Cast Metals Institute, provides education on metalcasting processes, materials and disciplines, and launched an e-learning initiative on July 1, 2016. AFS is based in Schaumburg, Illinois. Doug Kurkul joined AFS as CEO in January, 2016.https://www.foundrytradejournal.com/news/afs-finalises-ceo-transition- plan History For a number of years prior to the founding of the Society many local bodies of foundrymen met for mutual protection in regards to labor, prices and interchange of technical information. The attendance was usually strong in these organizations in times of prosperity but waned when economic conditions slowed. Early in 1896 the Philadelphia Foundrymen's Society through discussion with its members conceived that a more general, larger benefit might be gained through organizing a wider group of foundrymen. They invited foundrymen from around the country to Philadelphia for a meeting. The response was spontaneous and well received. On May 12, 1896, the American Foundrymen's Association was formed.The Foundry, Vol. 29, Issue 1, Cleveland, OH, September 1906 Organization The Society has approximately 925 business members and 7,000 individual members. There are 40 regional chapters, as well as 40 student chapters at colleges and universities. AFS is organized into 13 Divisions with committees under each division: * Engineering Division * Additive Manufacturing Division * Aluminum Division * Copper Alloy Division * Molding Methods & Materials Division * Cast Iron Division * Magnesium Division * Melting Methods & Materials Division * Steel Division * Environmental Health & Safety Division * Lost Foam Division * Government Affairs Division * Human Resources Division * Marketing Division In addition to these divisions, the organization has technical staff to assist with engineering services, a system to support research, and an extensive library. More than 15,000 articles from the digital library are available free of charge to members of the organization.

History The priory was founded in 1216 by Margery de Cressy, and was dedicated to St Mary in the Meadow (St Mary de Pratis).Norfolk 1: Norwich and North-East, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson, Beeston Regis entry. Unlike many small houses of the Augustinian Order, Beeston Priory was independent. The priory's canons served as parish priests for nearby churches, whilst also running a boys' school at the priory for both boarding and day students. The priory was originally endowed with of land, and was given the rights to wrecks and flotsam and jetsam. Within the monastic precinct there were agricultural buildings and probably a smithy, a brewery, a guest-house, a wash-house, latrines and other buildings necessary for the running of the busy local community. Pope John XXII who absolved Canon John de Walsam after attacking the Bishop of Norwich In 1317, a canon at the priory, John de Walsam, attacked the Bishop (most probably John Salmon, Bishop of Norwich) with a sword. After the matter was referred to Pope John XXII, de Walsam was sent to Rome. As the Bishop had recovered, the pope absolved de Walsam and instructed the Bishop to arrange for him to perform penance. In 1291 the priory was inspected for tax and was recorded as having an annual value of £25 5s. 10¼d for its possessions in Norfolk, and £2 10s. 10½d for those in Suffolk. Plan of the Priory On the 25 August 1494 the priory was visited by James Goldwell, Bishop of Norwich. This visit revealed that, although there were other priests present, the Prior, John Poty, was the only canon at the priory, as the other, Thomas Taverner, had gone \\"absent without leave\\". Bishop Goldwell instructed Prior Poty to find two new canons as soon as possible. The abbey was visited again on 18 July 1514, this time by Richard Nykke, Bishop of Norwich. Canon Thomas Taverner was again absent without leave, but was thought to have been in Norwich. The other canons were listed as Canon Nicholas Wodforth, Canon Robins, Canon Daume and Canon Rump. This visit revealed potential financial impropriety as the Prior would not produce the priory's accounts. Other concerns were that the school was not operational, and that matins were not being said at the right time. Bishop Nykke visited the priory again in August 1532, on the election of Prior Richard Hudson. He found all the accounts and affairs at the priory to be in order. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 lists the priory as having an income, after expenses, of £43 2s. 4¾d., and debts of £20. The priory is recorded as being in good repair and was home to the prior and three canons, six boys (boarding at the school) and seven servants. The lead and bells at the priory were valued at £60, more than the annual income of the establishment. The priory avoided immediate suppression when Prior Richard Hudson and his four canons, Nicholas Wodforth, William Wusbarow, James Fysser, and Robert Swyer accepted King Henry VIII's supremacy over the church. The priory was finally dissolved in 1538, at which time Prior Hudson was awarded an annual pension of £5 (which he was still in receipt of as late as 1553). The suppression of the Priory and its school left no local provision for education. This is believed to have led Sir John Gresham to found Gresham's School at nearby Holt in 1555.I Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School by S.G.G. Benson and Martin Crossley Evans (James & James, London, 2002) Writing to Thomas Cromwell in March 1538, Sir Richard Rich said that the Canons at the priory \\"pretended themselves to be friars\\"; several historical documents have picked up on this and mistakenly referred to the priory as a Friary. The Priory and its possessions were leased by The Crown to John Travers in 1540 before being awarded, in 1545, to Sir Edmund Wyndham and Giles Seafoule. The site is currently owned and protected by Norfolk County Council, who have opened the ruins to the public. The Priory ruins today The ruins of St Mary's Priory, Beeston Regis Much remains of the main priory church. The ruins indicate that the church nave, from the west wall to the transept, was about long, and wide, having a chancel added later. The north wall of the nave still stands practically to the roof level, although the divisions between the windows have long gone. The chancel, at the eastern end of the ruin, remains to roof height on the north and south side. The original eastern wall has been demolished, but a flint wall has been built up to window-sill level. The north-east corner still has most of its window mouldings. The cloister, to the south of the nave of the priory church, is now part of the Priory Farm garden. To the east of the cloister, still standing, are part of the walls of the chapter house, and also some traces of the dormitory. The refectory and other domestic buildings probably are beneath or have been incorporated into the 18th century Priory Farmhouse, which was probably built from materials from the demolition of the early buildings. The belfry tower has gone, although the first steps can be seen in a doorway in the south wall. The south wall is only as high as the window-sill level. The west wall is standing almost intact to gable height, although the lining of the original door has been replaced by modern brickwork. The north transept is long and wide. The east wall of the transept is entirely gone, except for traces of its junction with the north wall. At the south end of this wall once stood a pillar; the opposite pillar, west of the south door, is almost complete and in a good state of preservation. Also in the transept there is a doorway which leads to what is thought to be a sacristy, and is the only doorway remaining in its original form. West of the transept there is a small chapel long and wide. There also remain three monastic ponds close by. A tunnel is said to run to the Dunstable Arms Inn from the ruins of the priory, but if it ever existed, its whereabouts is a long-forgotten secret. The site is currently owned and protected by Norfolk County Council, who have opened the ruins to the public.

He is often referred to as the father of modern glass paperweights.  Early life  Stankard was born April 7, 1943 as the second of nine children in an Irish Catholic family. He lived in North Attleboro, Massachusetts in his early years. In his autobiography, Stankard chronicles his early struggles with dyslexia, which made him score poorly on tests because he couldn't read the test questions.Paul Joseph Stankard (2007), No Green Berries or Leaves - The Creative Journey of an Artist in Glass. McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company. His high school transcripts showed him graduating at the very bottom of his class with a low IQ. In the book, Stankard describes the pressure and stigma of being labeled a slow learner by an educational system that at the time was not aware of dyslexia and the steps he took to overcome his low self- esteem and learning disabilities to become one of the foremost artists of his generation. He later graduated from Salem County Technical Institute, in Salem, New Jersey, with a technical certification in Scientific Glassblowing.  Career  For the first ten years of his work career, he worked as a glassblower making scientific instruments for various chemical laboratories.Ulysses Grant Dietz, Paul J. Stankard: Homage to Nature. Harry N Abrams, Inc., . In 1967, Stankard worked under Francis Whittemore at Philco- Ford, whom he had met earlier while attending Salem, where Whittemore then taught. Earlier memories of seeing the Blaschka flowers at Harvard University and being in contact with Whittemore, inspired Stankard to start experimenting with making paperweights in 1969. Stankard, whose driving desire was to \\"be on the creative side and do what he loves\\", started producing glass paperweights in his garage while working in the industry to support his growing family. It was when Stankard displayed his early paperweights at a craft exhibit on the boardwalk of Atlantic City, New Jersey that Reese Palley, an internationally respected art dealer, saw his work and sponsored Stankard financially to move full-time into making glass art. In the early 1960s, paperweights made by other Americans showcased brightly colored \\"crafty\\" type flowers that were not botanically accurate. Stankard labored to make his glass floral designs look more natural and botanically lifelike. His glass flowers were so real looking that many people mistakenly thought that he had found a way to encase actual flowers in glass. Soon thereafter, paperweight makers (mostly American) were following Stankard's lead. Stankard, who is now an internationally acclaimed artist, is largely credited with changing the status of glass paperweights from that of \\"craft\\" to that of \\"fine art\\".

The Taskforce was asked to: *take stock of progress within the context of the UK's ten year transplant framework (published in 2003) *to identify barriers to organ donation *to recommend what action needs to be taken to increase organ donation and procurement within the current legal framework. Membership The ODTF comprised medical professionals, National Health Service managers, patients and patient representatives and ethicists and is chaired by Elisabeth Buggins.Organs for Transplants report, page 54&55 First Taskforce Report The ODTF published its first report ‘Organs for Transplants’ on 16 January 2008. In the report, the Taskforce makes 14 recommendations to the Government, which could see a 50 per cent increase in organ donation in the UK within five years - resulting in an additional 1,200 transplants a year and saving thousands of lives. The report proposes a radical shift from existing arrangements for the UK’s transplantation system. Together with other measures to improve donor coordination services this could result in a 10% increase in the consent rate for donation (currently at 60%). Second Taskforce Report At the time of launch of the First taskforce report, the UK Prime Minister called for a review of the legislation over consent for organ donation. The ODTF carried out an investigation and published its second report ‘The potential impact of an opt out system for organ donation in the UK’ on 17 November 2008 This report provided an in-depth examination of the potential impact of changing to an opt out system of consent for organ donation. It concluded that an opt out system should not be implemented in the UK at the current time. The Taskforce concluded that there was no convincing evidence that a change to opt out consent would deliver significant increases in the number of donated organs. It felt that such a system has the potential to undermine the concept of donation as a gift, to erode trust in NHS professionals and the Government and negatively impact on organ donation numbers. It concluded a change in consent system would be costly to implement. It also felt that an opt out consent system would distract attention away from the need to improve the systems and infrastructure around organ donation in the UK and the need to improve awareness and understanding of organ donation. In putting together the report, the Taskforce had discussions and engagement with academics, health professionals, members of the public, organ recipients, families of donors and faith leaders. The report details the considerable volume of evidence the ODTF considered before coming to its conclusions. Presumed consent – the current legislative position Under Part 1 of the Human Tissue Act 2004, it is unlawful to remove, store, or use human organs and other tissue for scheduled purposes without appropriate consent. The removal, storage and use of an organ for the purpose of transplantation are scheduled purposes in this context. Appropriate consent is defined within the Act Human Tissue Act 2004, Section 3 as: a. If a decision of a deceased person to consent to the activity, or a decision of his not to consent to it, was in force immediately before he had died, his consent. b. Where such a decision is not in force, then consent is required from either a nominated representative, or, a person in a qualifying relationship (such as next of kin). The Human Tissue Act 2004 covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 covers Scotland and has broadly similar provisions as far as transplantation is concerned. Background to the Taskforce's work Transplants currently enable about 2,700 people to pursue an active life in the UK every year. Transplants are the best possible treatment for most people with organ failure. Kidney transplants are the most common organ transplant performed in the UK. Transplants of the heart, liver and lungs are also regularly carried out. As medicine advances, other vital organs including the pancreas and small bowel are also being used in transplants. Tissue such as corneas, heart valves, skin and bone can also be donated. The increasing effectiveness of transplantation means that many more patients can be considered for treatment in this way but there is a serious shortage of donors. Around 8,000 people in the UK are currently awaiting a transplant. For some people this means waiting, sometime for years, and undergoing difficult and stressful treatment. Many will die before a suitable organ becomes available. Facts *Currently, between 7000 and 8,000 people in the UK need a transplant, currently rising by about 8% a year. *Over the last five years, UK Department of Health funding - £4.16million in 2006/07 - has supported a number of initiatives to increase donor rates. *Living donor and non- heartbeating donor rates have risen significantly in recent years. However, the rate of donation by heartbeating (death established through brain stem testing) donors (the main source of donor organs) has remained steady at best. *Over 14 million people - some 24% of the population - have now registered on the UK Organ Donor Register. *In the UK between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2007: 3,086 organ transplants were carried out, thanks to the generosity of 1,495 donors. 949 lives were saved in the UK through a heart, lung, liver or combined heart/lungs, liver/kidney, liver/pancreas or heart/kidney transplant. *A total of 2,137 patients received a kidney, pancreas or combined kidney/pancreas transplant. *A further 2,402 people had their sight restored through a cornea transplant. *A record number of non-heartbeating donor kidney transplants took place and accounted for one in seven of all kidney transplants. *The highest number of combined kidney/pancreas transplants took place (164, representing a 53% increase on 2005-2006). *Living donor kidney transplants are increasing - 461 in 2003-2004, 475 in 2004-2005, 589 in 2005-2006, and 690 in 2006-2007, and now represent more than one in four of all kidney transplants. *At the end of March 2007, 7,234 patients were listed as actively waiting for a transplant.

In 1982, after leaving school, Rosa was invited by a classmate to visit the Palmares do Sul area of the southern Brazilian state, Rio Grande do Sul. Unbeknownst to Rosa at the time, his colleague's father, Ney Azevedo, was the current mayor of Palmares and in speaking with Rosa during this visit, Azevedo was so impressed that he offered him the position of secretary of agriculture.Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 21. . =Rural electrification in Palmares do Sul= Seeking ways to improve life in the region, Rosa interviewed residents who noted the ongoing economic pressure driving rural flight from Palmares. Rosa saw that high water costs were a significant impediment for local rice farmers and that lowering these costs could improve productivity and wealth. To address the high water costs, Rosa suggested expanding rural electrification to allow more farmers to drop their own wells for irrigation rather than paying exorbitant fees for water rights held by others.Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 23. . At the time, 70 percent of rural residents in Palmares were without electricity.\\"Fabio Rosa\\". 2004. The Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship. Retrieved on 5 December 2008.

In 1990, along with colleague Ricardo de Souza Mello, Rosa began work on Pro Luz (Project Light) to expand the Palmares model throughout Brazil.Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 31. . The program proved successful and the Brazilian government was receptive, even offering a dedicated line of credit for rural electrification programs. However, in 1992, Brazilian economic troubles led the government to reduce social spending on these types of projects. The repeated difficulties Rosa faced working through government led him to focus future efforts through private organizations.Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. P. 31. . =S.T.A.= In 1992, Rosa established Sistemas de Tecnologia Agroelectro (STA) to popularize solar energy. He recognized that the critical barrier to the adoption of solar energy was its high cost. Thus, he worked to make it attractive by pairing it with electric fencing, which could help address Brazil's problems with overgrazing. Within several years STA had installed 700 solar powered fencing systems and Rosa \\"had gained national recognition as a leader in the delivery of low-cost solar energy\\".Bornstein, David. How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007.

It supports DICOM, HL7 and IHE integration profiles. History The history of DVTk goes back to 1997. Within the ARC group (Architecture Re-use and Communications) of Philips, the first version of the Validation Test Suite (VTS) was developed. This was a DICOM Validation tool with a command line interface. Based on this, later on, the ADVT (Agfa DICOM Validation Tool) was created. This was the first tool with a Graphical User Interface that made DICOM validation more pleasant. Because Philips and Agfa wanted to join forces, in 2001 their cooperation became a fact and the first version of DVT (1.2) was born in 2002. After major redesign and improvements, DVT 2.1 was released in June 2005. This version was the transition of the application from the Philips-AGFA cooperation project to the Open Source community. In 2006, ICT Automatisering joined the DVTk Open Source project as the third participating company next to Philips and Agfa.

From 1966 he held local leadership in the Socialist People's Party, which later became the Socialist Left Party. He opposed Norwegian membership in the European Union and NATO. Nonetheless, he did favor cooperation with the social democratic Labour Party, both locally as well as in the national Red-Green Coalition. He was elected to serve in Tromsø municipal council in 1987. Halfway through the term, in 1989, he was elected to represent Troms in the Norwegian Parliament.

Biography =Early life= Peter Warren Dease was born at Michilimackinac (now Mackinac Island) on January 1, 1788, the fourth son of Dr. John Dease, a staunch Irish republicanhttps://www.academia.edu/34056386/Peter_Warren_Dease_and_Arctic_Exploration and the captain and deputy agent of Indian Affairs, and Jane French, Catholic Mohawk from Caughnawaga.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?@andid_nbr=4387andinterval=20andand&id;_nbr=4387 His father was a nephew of Sir William Johnson, and first cousin of Sir John Johnson. He was named after Admiral Sir Peter Warren, an uncle of Sir William Johnson.https://www.academia.edu/34056386/Peter_Warren_Dease_and_Arctic_Exploration He was raised by his family in Mackinac Island and then Montreal, until he left home at the age of 13 to work in the fur trade.https://www.academia.edu/34056386/Peter_Warren_Dease_and_Arctic_Exploration =Fur trade= Dease first worked for the New North West (XY) Company at Great Slave Lake. After that company's amalgamation with the North West Company in 1804, he was appointed to the position of clerk at Athabasca. In 1817 he was moved to the Mackenzie District, first at Fort Good Hope, then later at Fort Chipewyan and other Mackenzie posts. In 1821, the North West and Hudson's Bay Companies were united, and he became a chief trader for the Hudson's Bay Company, working in the Athabaska district. Dease was asked by George Simpson to mount an expedition to explore the Finlay River basin in 1823, with the goal of developing the fur trade in that region, however Dease was unable to undertake the expedition that year, and the task was reassigned to Samuel Black. However in 1825 he was given the opportunity to participate in Sir John Franklin's second expedition to the arctic. After his return from the Franklin expedition, Dease took charge of Fort Good Hope, and was stationed there from 1827 to 1829. In 1828 he was appointed a Chief Factor in the Hudson's Bay Company, as well as member of the Council. He was charged with developing trade along the newly discovered Peel's River. He recommended a post be established at near the source of the river, however it was another decade before the post, Peel's Post was built. In 1829 Dease handed over Fort Good Hope to John Bell, and was stationed briefly at Fort Simpson. He spent the winter of that year at the newly constructed Fort Halkett, serving in an advisory capacity. In 1830 he was appointed to Fraser Lake to succeed William Conolly in the New Caledonia district. In 1835 Dease requested a leave of absence due to ill health, probably failing eyesight. The leave was granted, after which he was placed in charge of a new arctic expedition. =Arctic exploration= In 1825 Dease was placed in charge of the commissariat in Sir John Franklin's second expedition to the Arctic, having been personally requested by Franklin, who had met him on his first arctic expedition. Dease provided information about the local natives, and arranged for them to supply the expedition. He also supervised the construction of Fort Franklin at Great Bear Lake. From 1836 to 1839 he was placed in charge of a 12 man expedition to explore the Arctic coast of North America, from the mouth of the Mackenzie River to Point Barrow, filling in information gaps left by other expeditions in search of the Northwest Passage. The expedition left on June 1, 1837, and arrived at Point Barrow on August 4. They wintered at Fort Confidence on Great Bear Lake and set out eastward in the spring, mapping 100 miles of coastline and naming Victoria Land and Cape Pelly. They again wintered at Fort Confidence, and in the spring of 1839 again explored eastward. On August 16 they reached Montreal Island and discovered a cache of supplies left by George Back. Dease's junior officer, Thomas Simpson, often complained that he was indolent, and it is Simpson, as opposed to Dease, is generally given credit for the success of the mission. This may be because the only first-hand account of the expedition available until recently was Simpson's posthumously published journals. For his services in connection with this expedition Dease was given a £100 pension by Queen Victoria, and was rumoured to have been offered a knighthood, which he turned down.https://collections.dartmouth.edu/arctica-beta/html/EA15-21.html =Retirement= Following the expedition, Dease was given another leave of absence, from 1840 to 1841, during which time he married (August 3, 1840) and settled on a farm in Côte Sainte-Catherine, near Montreal. He retired from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843. He remained at Côte Sainte-Catherine until his death on January 17, 1863. He and his wife, Elizabeth Chouinard, a Métis, had eight children: four sons and four daughters. Personal description Dease was described in George Simpson's Character Book (compiled in 1832), as being: > About 45 years of Age. Very steady in business, an excellent Indian trader, > speaks several of the Languages well and is a man of very correct conduct > and character. Strong, vigorous and capable of going through a great deal of > Severe Service but rather indolent, wanting in ambition to distinguish > himself in any measure out of the usual course, inactive until aroused to > exertion and over easy and indulgent to his people which frequently > occasions laxity of discipline, but when his temper gets ruffled he becomes > furiously violent. His judgement is sound, his manners are more pleasing and > easy than those of many of his colleagues, and altho' not calculated to make > a shining figure, may be considered a very respectable member of the > concern. Dease was a well-liked man by many people, amongst them being Captain Franklin and Letitia Hargrave, the wife of James Hargrave of York Factory. Dease’s previous expedition experience greatly impressed Franklin, as he was knowledgeable of the Indians and the country Franklin intended to travel through. Letitia was known to be very critical of the people she met. However, of Dease, she wrote: \\"I like him much better than any of them, he looks like a gentleman & is pleasing in every respect.\\" In a letter addressed to James Hargrave, one Charles Ross had only kind words for Dease: \\"… I found a most amiable warm-hearted, sociable man — quite free rom haughtiness & reserve, which often characterises [sic] those who have little else to recommend them — and if Fortune always favours the Good, he should enjoy an unusual share of her smiles.\\" Most notably, the men who accompanied him on the expedition thought very highly of him. He tried to encourage his companions by playing the violin and flute, as well as hosting entertaining dinner parties. Thomas Simpson, however, did not think as highly of Dease as others. He would frequently refer to Dease using demeaning terms in his correspondences, specifically with his brother, Alexander Simpson, and his good friend Donald Ross. He was \\"more than doubtful\\" of Dease’s ability to contract a fisherman for the expedition and states so clearly in his letter to Ross in August 1836. Two years later in 1838, Simpson’s opinion of Dease has not improved. In fact it may have deteriorated with the stress of the company’s first wintering at Fort Confidence. Again to Donald Ross, he writes, \\"Mr. Dease is a very worthy man, well acquainted with the management of Indians and of an inland establishment, but it is no vanity to say that everything which requires either planning or execution devolves upon me.\\" Barr notes that Simpson’s statement is most inaccurate, since Dease successfully operated the New Caledonia District for five years which was known to be a very difficult area to control. It was remote and so maintaining supply lines was strenuous. The area relied on salmon rather than pemmican or caribou, and the occasional fishery failures could prove disastrous. In addition, the reliance on salmon alone would cause health problems. Simpson even goes on to say that he \\"cannot help regarding him and his followers as dead weight upon the expedition … showing that ten years' experience well applied may be more valuable than that of a life-time.\\" In contrast, it is difficult to know what Dease thought of these people who though so highly of him. It was only recently that his expedition journals were discovered and then published by William Barr. Even so, it does not offer very much insight on his opinion.

Mass transit is composed of 19 inner-city tram lines and 120 bus routes, both managed entirely by Zagrebački električni tramvaj. Croatian Railways manages the parallel Zagreb Commuter Rail system. The city is served by the Franjo Tuđman Airport, which carries more than 3,300,000 passengers per year. Road transport Marin Držić and Slavonska Avenues interchange (so-called Petlja) Zagreb drivers typically use a wide network of avenues and other arterial streets. Due to the shape of the city, most of the trips done in the city are on the east-west relation, causing high traffic on roads like Vukovar Avenue, Dubrovnik Avenue and Zagrebačka Avenue. The Slavonska Avenue is the longest and one of the most congested roads in Zagreb, connecting the inner city to the A3 highway in the east. Zagreb is a regional highway hub with eight highways and expressways radially leading into the city through the Zagreb bypass. Major highways and expressways include A1/A6, leading to Gorski Kotar, the Littoral and Dalmatia; A3 leading west to Rakitje, Samobor, Žumberak and Slovenia and east to Rugvica, Ivanić-Grad, Slavonia and Serbia; A2 leading northwest to Zaprešić, Zabok, Krapina and Central Europe; A4 leading northeast to Varaždin, Čakovec, Hungary and on to Eastern Europe; A11 leading southeast to Velika Gorica, Sisak and Petrinja (still in construction) and D10 leading east to Vrbovec and Križevci. Similar to other European cities, Zagreb does not feature a regular grid plan. Donji Grad, the Zagreb downtown, mostly built in the 19th century, features a quasi-rectangular street plan, but the rest of the city depends on the form of wide straight avenues intersecting densely built neighborhoods composed of mostly chaotical street systems. =Taxicabs= The light sign of a Zagreb taxicab The first taxicab ever in Zagreb started operating on June 11, 1901. It was driven by Tadija Bartolović, a skilled fiaker driver. After a successful test drive where Bartolović drove mayor Adolf Mošinsky through Mesnička Street and Gornji Grad, the first taxicab stand in the city was opened on the Ban Jelačić Square. The association of taxicab drivers Radio Taksi Zagreb, of over 1,150 taxicabs, was the sole provider of taxi services in the city before 2011 when the first of many competitive services started to run taxicabs in the city. Mass transit Tram Mass transit in Zagreb is managed by the company Zagrebački električni tramvaj (ZET), part of the Zagreb Holding, a holding managing utilities and other city services. ZET's trams used to span the entire city, but due to only two expansions (the Dubec and Prečko routes) in the last 20 years, trams are today confined to the inner city. However, a bus network supplements the tram and services a large part of the Zagreb metropolitan area even outside the borders of the city proper. Other transport amenities are also available, such as the Sljeme gondola lift (closed for re-construction since 2007) or the Zagreb Funicular. =Tram= The first tram line was opened on September 5, 1891, setting off a vital part of the Zagreb mass transit system. Zagreb today features an extensive tram network with 15 day and 4-night lines running over of tracks through 255 stations and transporting almost 500,000 passengers per day (almost twice as much as the Los Angeles County Metro Rail). The network covers much of the inner city, but some lines extend to the suburbs, such as line 15 (operating in Podsljeme) or lines 7 and 11 (operating in Sesvete). Although the trams are capable of achieving speeds in excess of , the unique fact that the network operates mostly at the curb limits their speed to the speed of surrounding vehicles, causing the trams to travel at speeds of 25–50 km/h (15-31 mph) in the inner city, with considerable slowdowns during the rush hours. The rolling stock is made up by various trams, including around 10 TMK 201 and around 50 ČKD-Tatra T4 remaining from 1970's (a few more may be stored and out of service for longer periods), 51 Tatra KT4, 16 TMK 2100 and 142 new, 100% low- floor TMK 2200 cars, of those 140 are 32 m standard version and only 2 shorter 21 m, with a further purchase planned. TMK 2200 is produced by the Crotram consortium, composed of Končar elektroindustrija and TŽV Gredelj, both from Zagreb. Commuter rail With 21 trains, the Zagreb suburban railway mainly covers the eastern and western parts of Zagreb. It mostly operates on the same standard-gauge lines used for Croatian Railways' long-distance trains. The trains normally operate on a 15-minute frequency, but reach only a portion of the city's suburbs. Metro A second light-rail or metro system, the Zagreb Metro, has been planned numerous times. It would complement the tram commuter rail networks, but currently, it is not even clear if the system would be a full metro or a light Metro. The introduction to a mass rapid rail system has been analysed and presented in works in the period 1999-2001 after the finalization of the \\"Transport study of the city of Zagreb\\" that was co- financed by World Bank and the City of Zagreb with 1.0 million US$ in relation 50/50%. The first plans were presented in 2004, under which a light Metro would have been built, going at speeds of merely up to 35 km/h. It has been stated that the full Metro is not worth building. A full metro would cost twice as much as the light metro, and could carry up to 70,000 people per hour in a direction. Forecasts predict that by 2020 the maximum load of passengers will be 7,000. It is worth noting, however, that the current tram network is used by around 200 million passengers every year, which would put the number of daily passengers at 50,000, a number which merits a high capacity rapid transit system. The light metro's capacity would be 24,000, but due to the significantly cheaper cost, it was the preferred choice in January 2007, when the City Authorities announced plans for a new Metro System consisting of 4-5 metro lines. Phase 1 of the new metro was going to be 22.7 km long, of which 10 km would be underground. The Metro system will be based on the light rail PTN system currently in use in Vancouver, San Francisco or Singapore, but a full metro system is also a possibility. There would be three lines running west–east, and two running north–south, converging on the city center. All lines were planned to go underground in the city center. Once the Zagreb metro system would be fully completed it would have 25 km of underground and 55 km overground lines. The cost of this entire system is thought to be about 5.5 billion Euro over 20 years. The initial cost would be between 600 million and 1,14 billion Euro. A definitive public transport concept has yet to be decided upon, mostly due to funding issues caused by budgetary constraints. Premetro concept, Light rail concept (fully excluding expensive tunnel boring) on existing heavy rail corridors which need updating and some newly built, or full scale subway. There is no definitive starting point for construction works, with the project unlikely to start before the 2030s. In September 2009, a plan for a light rail system was presented at the Croatian Chamber of Civil Engineers (HKIG) meeting by Dr. Davorin Kolić, a rail system designer with international experience. Water transport The river Sava flows through the city, but it is not navigable in Zagreb and the nearest port is located in Sisak. The city has had a history of flooding, and following the last catastrophic flood in 1964, when inundation affected of inner-city territory, city authorities had built a system of levées to protect itself from Sava, together with a discharge canal Sava-Odra, completed in 1971. Since then the city's waterside has been strictly isolated, spanned only by three central bridges between the north of Zagreb and Novi Zagreb in the south. Later, seven more bridges were built in the west and the east, also over the levees.

Although a considerable length of passage has been explored in Langcliffe Pot, the current end is over above the resurgence, and over in distance. A trip to the far end has been described as \\"one of the most serious undertakings in British Caving\\".  Description  The entrance lies within a shakehole where a small hole between blocks leads to a ledge at the top of a shaft. This lands in a chamber with a narrow rift passage leading off which degenerates into the Craven Crawl, of low, wet passage. At a junction with an inlet, the passage enlarges into Stagger Passage, of walking and stooping. At the start of a deep canal it passes a passage on the left which is the main way to the alternative entrance of Oddmire Pot. The canal passage continues to meet a major junction at Hammerdale Dub, where over a of upstream passages also lead back towards Oddmire Pot. Downstream, of boulder-strewn streamway finishes where the water disappears under a wall, but a small passage leads into Boireau Falls Chamber, at the base of which it is possible to regain the stream. This finishes at Nemesis, a shaft below which a route through a tight and complex boulder choke leads into Gasson's Series. This is initially a high streamway which degenerates into a low wet section, beyond which the passage continues for before arriving at Poseiden Sump, which has been dived for some to where it became small. Back at the low pool, an dry inlet passage of fine rift passage and chambers continues for over before decreasing in size, and dropping into the large New Fearnought Streamway. Downstream leads to Dementor Sump, which has been dived for to a blockage. Upstream terminates in a boulder blockage after . Oddmire Pot () is located north-west of Langcliffe Pot. A small hole in a shakehole leads on to a broken shaft. At the base of this Strid Passage continues as a crawling / stooping passage for about before joining Stagger Passage from Langcliffe Pot. An obscure inlet about from the beginning leads into The Roads, an alternative and longer route to Hammerdale Dub.  Geology and Hydrology  Langcliffe Pot is a solutional cave formed within rocks of the Yoredale Series of the Pendlian and Brigantian substages of the Mississippian epoch of the Carboniferous period. The Yoredale Group consists of a number of cyclothems, with sequences of sandstones, shales and thin coals separating limestones into well-defined beds separated by aquicludes. The upper part of the cave is formed at the base of the Middle Limestone and the passages run down dip towards the south-east, floored by sandstone. In Boireau Falls Chamber the stream cuts through the sandstone bed, and then through of shale into the Simonstone Limestone. Nemesis Pitch drops straight through this, and the Gassson Series is formed totally within the Hardraw Limestone. The resurgence at Black Keld, some below the lowest point of Langcliffe Pot, lies in the Great Scar Limestone. Langcliffe Pot falls within the Black Keld catchment area. Most of the drainage within the catchment feeds into Mossdale Beck which sinks into the limestone at Mossdale Scar. Langcliffe Pot is fed by a few small streams that drain an area of the flanks of Great Whernside about wide. The water then drains down dip in the general direction of Mossdale. The waters of Mossdale Caverns and Langcliffe Pot combine at some unknown point, and resurge at Black Keld. Black Keld has been penetrated by divers for about - well short of Langcliffe Pot.  History  Langcliffe Pot was first spotted in December 1935 by members of the Craven Pothole Club (CPC), and they made the first descent made the following April when the first of traverse in the downstream passage was explored to a pool. Soon after, they dye tested the Langcliffe Pot and Rig Pot streams and various others to Black Keld. Another party from the same club descended in 1954 and pushed on for a further along what is now known as Craven Crawl before turning back. In August 1978 a team from the Yorkshire Underground Research Team explored over beyond the CPC limit as far as the Kilnsey Boulder Crawl. They weren't too impressed with the place, and handed over the baton to the University of Leeds Speleological Society (ULSA). Over the next three months, ULSA explored and surveyed the main stream passage as far as Boireau Falls Chamber, and all the major inlets, giving a total system length of . The next phase of exploration took place in 1970 when the choke in Boireau Falls Chamber was excavated, and Nemesis Pitch discovered. A week later a route was found through the complex boulder choke at the bottom, and a further of passages discovered. In June 1972 the system flooded whilst an ULSA diving team were on the far side of the Nemesis boulder choke, trapping them which resulted in a major rescue call-out. The party emerged unscathed after a 44 hour long trip. A second major rescue occurred in 1974 when five cavers became trapped on the far side of the Nemesis Choke after boulder movement.

Career Wolfgang Hoffmann-Riem was born into a family of teachers. He had four siblings, one of whom died at a very young age. After passing the general qualification for university entrance (Abitur) at the Walddörfer-Gymnasium in Hamburg, he studied law while minoring in economics at the Universities of Hamburg, Freiburg i.Br., Munich, and Berkeley. He was awarded an LL.M. at Berkeley. In 1964 he passed the first state examination and in 1968 obtained a doctorate in law. After passing the second state examination in 1970, he spent four years working as a lawyer. In 1974 he obtained his postdoctoral qualification (Habilitation), which led to an appointment as professor of public law and public administration at the University of Hamburg. From 1977 to 1979, he was the spokesperson for Law Department II at the University of Hamburg, which offered a new single-tier law education as an alternative to the traditional two-tier education in Law Department I. He was offered but declined faculty appointments at the Universities of Hannover, Frankfurt a.M., and Berlin. From 1979 to 1995, Hoffmann-Riem was director of the Hans Bredow Institute for media research, which is affiliated with the University of Hamburg, and from July 1998 until December 1999, he chaired its newly created directorate. Following his appointment as judge of the Federal Constitutional Court, he became an honorary member of the directorate. From 1981 to 1983, he served as chair of the German Association for the Sociology of Law and from 1989 to 1992 as chair of the German Communication Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Publizistik- und Kommunikationswissenschaft, DGPuK). Since 1988 he has been director of the Research Centre for Environmental Law and from 1996 to 2012 director of the Centre for Research in Law and Innovation, CERI, both at the University of Hamburg. From 1995 to 1997, he was Minister of Justice of the State of Hamburg. During this period, he also chaired the Committee on Legal Affairs of the German Bundesrat. From 1999 to 2008, he served as judge in the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court. In 2007 he was appointed by the federal government as the German representative on the European Commission for Democracy through Law, also known as the Venice Commission. In 2009/10 Hoffmann-Riem was a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study (Wissenschaftskolleg) in Berlin. Since 2012 he serves as affiliate professor of law and innovation at the Bucerius Law School, Hamburg. Main Areas of Research Hoffmann-Riem has sought to change the understanding of law as a discipline dealing solely with the interpretation of norms to one in which actions and decisions focus on resolution of problems. Emphasizing the problem-solving capacity of the legal system, he has maintained that law can help overcome social problems and achieve resolution of specific conflicts if suitable frameworks are deployed in a legal system that is efficient and results-oriented. In his view, this concept derives from the interaction between norms and social reality – that is, the operative area of norms (the so-called \\"Realbereich\\") – and from the effects of the way in which law is applied, with such effects being measured across disciplines by incorporating sociology, economics, and natural sciences. This fundamental understanding has been given expression by Hoffmann-Riem throughout all phases of his extensive career and research.Andreas Voßkuhle: Wie betreibt man offen(e) Rechtswissenschaft? in: Wolfgang Hoffmann-Riem, Offene Rechtswissenschaft, Mohr Siebeck, Tübingen, 2010 S.153-173\\"; \\"Ino Augsberg, Erläuterungen, in : Ino Augsberg, Sebastian Unger (eds.), Basictexte: Grundrechtstheorie, Nomos, Baden-Baden, 2012, S.342-344\\". An example of this is his role in reforming legal education in Germany. Traditionally having two parts, the manner of instruction he helped to create forged a stronger bond between the once-separate theoretical and practical aspects. In numerous advisory roles with governments, parliaments, and organizations, as well as his participation in a variety of commissions, he has strived to include the voice of practitioners. In addition, his extensive research and teaching engagements abroad (e.g., at Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, and Melbourne) have enabled him to incorporate views from other legal systems as well. In analyzing the problems and possibilities associated with legal regulation, he has focused on the media. Thanks to ground-breaking technological breakthroughs (cable and satellite television, digitalization, the Internet) and accompanying shifts in the market, this area has offered him a rich source of material for studying the interplay between responses at the law-making level and social, technological, economic, and political developments. While this transformation was happening, he was head of the Hans Bredow Institute for Radio and Television, whose main focus was on sociological issues. Hoffmann-Riem has seen environmental law as another example of a field warranting closer examination of the problems associated with traditional governmental regulation – variously characterized by writers as a \\"crisis\\" – and of the need for new regulatory approaches. On these topics, his primary interest has been the interplay between governmental and private entities (so- called \\"cooperative administrative law\\"), specifically the question of just what type of law is required when the state largely turns over its public- interest responsibilities to the private sector while remaining tasked with their fulfillment. In an attempt to describe this dynamic, he coined the term \\"regulated self-regulation.\\" In the early 1990s, Hoffmann-Riem initiated a systematic discussion among academics and practitioners on the need and possible options for the reform of administrative law. In doing so, he gained the support of the renowned Heidelberg scholar Eberhard Schmidt-Aßmann. This discussion resulted in a ten-volume series entitled \\"The Reform of Administrative Law\\" (\\"Schriften zur Reform des Verwaltungsrechts\\"), published by Nomos Verlag. Another project ensuing from this discussion on reform was a systematic handbook with Hoffmann-Riem as editor – again with Schmidt-Aßmann and also Andreas Voßkuhle – entitled \\"Fundamentals of Administrative Law\\" (\\"Grundlagen des Verwaltungsrechts\\"), which have been published in 2006 till 2009, second edition 2012/2013. Fifty authors contributed to this project. In the 1990s, taking note of on-going public criticism that the ability of German society to innovate was hamstrung on account of restrictions imposed by law, Hoffmann-Riem called for the establishment of a new legal discipline, which came to be called research in law and innovation (see, e.g., \\"Research in Law and Innovation\\" [\\"Schriften zur rechtswissenschaftlichen Innovationsforschung\\"], published by Nomos Verlag). In 1995 he founded the Centre for Research in Law and Innovation (CERI) at the University of Hamburg and undertook several research projects on the importance of law in society- based technological and social innovation. During his tenure as Senator of Justice in the Hamburg Senate, Hoffmann-Riem conceived and initiated an overhaul of Hamburg's judicial administration termed \\"Justice 2000\\", and it became a model for other German states. Judge of the German Federal Constitutional Court In 1999 the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) nominated the politically unaffiliated scholar Hoffman-Riem as judge of the Federal Constitutional Court, and he was subsequently elected by the Bundesrat. His scope of responsibility encompassed, inter alia, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, general protection of privacy, protection of personal information, and competition law. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, he authored a series of decisions that gave rise to spirited public debate, including those on freedom of assembly and the relationship between freedom and security (for example, decisions on sweeping wiretapping powers [\\"Großen Lauschangriff\\"], wiretapping using foreign trade law or general police regulations, profiling, online searches, automated recording of car license plates, and data retention.) While recognizing the need for the state to ensure public safety, the Constitutional Court held that guarantees afforded by the rule of law may not be ignored and governmental power must be limited, and even in the face of perceived threats, it is paramount that the principles of proportionality and certainty in the application of law be respected and procedural safeguards be maintained. In these decisions (for example, in the ruling dealing with online searches), the Constitutional Court dealt extensively with developments in current technology that have long been the subject of Hoffmann-Riem's research. Honors In 2008 the German Federal President bestowed on Hoffmann-Riem the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

History  Yongmudo was developed at Yong- In University and has been practiced at this university as a self-defense art since 1953. The Martial Arts College of Yong-In University formally announced the creation of a new discipline, known as Yongmoodo on October 15, 1998. The Self-Defense Yongmudo Club was formed in 1974 and the World Yongmudo Federation was established in 1999. Norman Link believes that yongmudo \\"was developed in part because as taekwondo grew into a dazzling martial sport, it lost most of the other aspects, like self-defense.\\" Etymology The term Yongmoodo (literally translated as \\"Dragon Martial Way\\") comes from the word Hankido which was developed in Korea in 1976. Then the name changed to Kukmodo and then changed to Yongmoodo. Yongmoodo consists of three syllables: 1. YONG means dragon. 2. MU or MOO means martial which refers to fighting or battles and fights including defense and strategic, physical, mental, and physiology aspects. 3. DO means a way of training and a way of life and contains philosophy and the ability to learn from nature, live and fight, against nature. Features Yongmudo uses various dynamic techniques from martial arts such as Taekwondo, Judo, and Ssirum and is based on physical, psychological, spiritual, and mental training with contemporary scientific knowledge. Yongmudo was developed with an emphasis on education, training and martial arts philosophy. It is a practical self-defense training system, combining most practical techniques from several traditional Korean martial arts as well as other related disciplines. The primary techniques of Yongmoodo including offensive and defensive techniques are throwing, grappling and ground techniques from Judo, slamming and holding down from Wrestling, kicking, striking, thrusting, punching and blocking from Taekwondo, Kumdo and Kerkki, and joint locking from Hapkido. Scientific study A study about the effects of yongmoodo exercises confirmed that \\"the functional balance mat for Yongmoodo exercise program could improve the posture alignment pursuant and gait abilities of body imbalance of obese elementary students.\\" Another study concluded that the high intensity yongmudo training could improve the maximum muscle strength of aduit males. A study about the turning kicks in Taekwondo and Yongmudo reached the conclusion that the turning kick was performed quicker by the Taekwondo players. By country =Australia= The Yongmoodo Australia Association (YAA) and the Yongmoodo Oceania Association (YOA), founded by In Cheol Yoo (a graduate of Yong-In University), were established to formally support the objectives of Yong-In University’s aim to develop and promote Yongmoodo in the world. =Indonesia= Yongmudo is currently used extensively in military training in Indonesia. This sport has officially become a mandatory sport among the Indonesian Army since 2008. =Iran= Keyvan Dehnad is the founder and president of Iran Yongmudo. Amir Sheikh Hosseini won a gold medal and Mohammadreza Goodary won a bronze medal in World Martial Arts Masterships (2016). Iranian athletes won a gold medal (Arya Sheikh Hosseini) and a bronze medal (Mohammadreza Goodary) in World Martial Arts Masterships (2019). =United States= Yongmudo is practiced in University of California Martial Arts Program. The US Yongmudo Association is the official national organization for the promotion of Yongmudo in the US. Russell Ahn is the current US Yongmudo Association President and Deputy Secretary General of the International Yongmudo Federation.

He plays hurling with his local club Craughwell and has been a member of the Galway senior inter-county team from 1997-2009. Playing career =Club= Healy plays his club hurling with his local club in Craughwell and has enjoyed much success. He started to hurl with the club when he was only seven years-old and went on to play in county under-14 and under-16 finals before inspiring the rural Galway side to an historic under-21 county championship breakthrough in the mid-1990s. Healy, however, has never won a senior county title with his club. =Inter-county= Healy came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Galway at an early age. As a member of the county's under-14 team he captured a Tony Forrestal Cup winners' medal in the early 1990s. Healy was later chosen on the Galway under-16 team, with whom he collected a Nenagh Co-Op title. Healy subsequently became a member of the Galway minor team, where he was successful once again. In 1993 Galway qualified for the All-Ireland final, however, Healy was not a member of the starting fifteen. He did enter the field of play as a substitute, however, Galway were defeated by Kilkenny on that occasion. In 1994 Galway were back in the All-Ireland minor final once again, with Healy lining out on the half- forward line. Cork provided the opposition on this occasion, however, Galway emerged victorious by 2-10 to 1-11. It was Healy's first All-Ireland medal. Healy played with the Galway minor again in 1995, however, the team's championship involvement ended at the semi-final stage. In 1996 Healy was eligible to play with the Galway under-21 hurling team. It was a successful year as the county reached the All-Ireland final in that grade. Wexford were the opponents in that game, however, Galway had a comfortable 1-14 to 0-7 victory. It was Healy's first All-Ireland medal in the under-21 grade. In 1997 Galway qualified for the All-Ireland final once again. This time Cork provided the opposition and it was Cork who claimed the victory at the full-time whistle. 1998 saw Healy line out in a third consecutive All-Ireland under-21 final. Cork were the opponents once again. After an entertaining hour of hurling it was 'the Rebels' who emerged victorious by 2-15 to 2-10. 1996 also saw Healy taste success with the Galway junior hurling team. That year Healy's county reached the All-Ireland final in that competition. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion, however, it was Galway who took a 1-14 2-9. This gave Healy an All-Ireland title at junior level. Healy made his competitive debut with the Galway senior hurling team in 1997. It took him a few years, however, before he established himself on the championship team. In 1999 Galway qualified for the final of the National Hurling League competition. Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion, however, after an entertaining seventy minutes it was Tipp who emerged victorious by 1-14 to 1-10. 1999 also saw Healy taste success with the Galway intermediate hurling team. That year Healy's county reached the All-Ireland final in that competition. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion, however, it was Galway who took a 3-13 to 2-10. This gave Healy an All-Ireland title at intermediate level. 2000 saw Galway reach the National League final for a second year in-a-row. Tipperary were the opponents once again, however, on this occasion Galway had the upper-hand. A 2-18 to 2-13 victory gave Healy his first major title at senior level. Later that same year Healy made his senior championship debut in an All-Ireland quarter-final against Tipperary. Galway recorded a victory on that occasion, however, Healy had a less than auspicious debut. Galway were defeated by Kilkenny in the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final. In 2001 Galway ended a barren spell in the championship by reaching the All-Ireland final. Recent rivals Tipperary were the opponents in what turned out to be an entertaining contest. Healy had a good game in the forward line. He scored a goal for Galway and hit the post twice, however, Mark O'Leary's two goals gave Tipp the threshold to withstand a Galway fight-back. At the full-time whistle Tipp were the victors by 2-18 to 2-15. Galway went through a barren spell following this appearance in the championship decider. In 2005 Galway shocked Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final in one of the games of the decade to book a spot in the All-Ireland final with Cork. A Ben O'Connor goal in the sixteenth minute paved the way for a cork victory, in spite of a Damien Hayes goal reducing the deficit to one point. Galway failed to score in the last ten minutes as Cork recorded a 1-21 to 1-16 victory. The following few seasons saw Galway fail to build on this. In 2006 and 2007 Kilkenny restored the status quo by defeating Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. In 2008 Healy's side failed to beat fourteen-man Cork, thus not even reaching the All-Ireland quarter-final in spite of great expectations. =Provincial= Healy has also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial competition.

Plot The story is set on Christmas Eve in a New England town in the late 1890s. The Cosgrove family's home is in an uproar over the holidays. The patriarch, Clark Cosgrove (Paul Lynde) is frazzled by the gift demands of his loud children. His wife Nellie (Anne Meara) runs into endless friction with Clark's formidable mother (Alice Ghostley), who lives with them.

A German uncle (Howard Morris) is also arriving, but complications ensue when a traveling salesman (George Gobel) is mistaken for the uncle. Adding to the tumult is a visit from a caroling neighbor (Anson Williams). During the night, Clark's mother-in-law's cat escapes from the house and winds up on the roof. Clark goes to retrieve the cat and creates a ruckus, waking the house. When the children ask if the noise came from Santa Claus, Clark initially wants to dispel the myth of Santa Claus.

(2005) \\"Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story. Advocate Books. (Pages 188-189). Lynde's casting as a relatively straight, dramatic lead fulfilled a longstanding wish of his for more serious roles. Lynde was responsible for casting Martha Raye as his mother-in-law, telling an interviewer: \\"It's my chance to repay her for all the times she used me in her NBC Comedy Hour back in the 1950s.\\" George Gobel's casting in this production was an apparent coincidence and not related to his appearance three years earlier in a holiday special of the same name. For the climactic recitation of A Visit from St. Nicholas, Lynde was not allowed to rely on cue cards because director Tim Kiley felt they would distract the child actors in the cast. Lynde would later recall: \\"I had to do the poem five different times for five different camera angles.

The game is the sixteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series, and was released on the App Store in Europe on June 9, 2008 and in North America on July 9, 2008. The game's story centers on a racing tournament held by antagonists Nitrous Oxide, Doctor Neo Cortex and Ripper Roo in an attempt to banish the titular character, Crash Bandicoot, and his friends from their island home. The game was followed by a sequel, Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 2, in 2010. Plot Nitrous Oxide, the main antagonist of Crash Team Racing, teams up with Doctor Neo Cortex and Ripper Roo and stages a kart-racing tournament to bring Crash Bandicoot and his friends out of hiding. The winners of the tournament will be crowned \\"Kings Of Kart Racing For All Eternity\\", while the losers will be banished from N. Sanity Island. Gameplay Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D is a racing game in which the player controls characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe, most of whom race in karts. The game employs tilt-screen controls, allowing the player to steer the kart by tilting the iPhone or iPod Touch in a steering wheel fashion. The karts accelerate automatically. To get around tough turns on a track, the player can initiate a \\"power slide\\" by tapping and holding a finger on the screen. The goal in each race is to arrive at finish line in the first place. The game features a number of racing modes (including a story mode, a quick race mode and a tournament mode) and a total of 20 tracks to race on. Scattered throughout the tracks are weapons that can be picked up and used against the other racers in a bid to hinder their performance, such as bombs and oil slicks. Special \\"speed zippers\\" can be found on the ground that can, if driven over, boost the player's speed for a short time. The same effect can be achieved by picking up a certain power-up off the track and activating it. Release Initially, Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D launched for Symbian on April 29, 2008. The European release was helped by a marketing campaign with contests that had prizes modeled after Australia, and funded wireless application protocol advertising banners across several mobile entertainment sites. Vivendi also organized Crash Bandicoot Grand Prix in certain parts of Europe, where selected fans and key players from the video game industry got a chance to play against each other in kart tournaments. The game was later released for N-Gage on January 6, 2009, with exclusive tracks included. Reception Often compared to Mario Kart series, the game received positive reviews. Levi Buchanan of IGN commended the game as \\"the best racer in the App Store right now\\" noting that there is \\"lots of tracks to unlock\\". Hardcore Gamer repeated similar remarks, saying it's \\"easily the best racing on the iPhone\\". Many reviewers praised the game's controls. Levi Buchanan thought they were solid and tight, and Hardcore Gamer noted that they are \\"responsive and accurate\\", setting up an example for the potential of iPhone. By April 2009, Nitro Kart 3D was the highest-selling paid application on the App Store.

The story is considered a parody on the still ongoing language war between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in the authors' native Belgium. The plot is similar in a way to King Smurf, an earlier adventure, in that the usually harmonious community of Smurfs falls into disarray due to the failure of father-figure Papa Smurf to exercise his leadership. When released in book form, the French and English versions included a number of one-page stories with the Smurfs undertaking various forms of sport from archery to fishing with comical results. Title The title literally means Smurf Green and Green Smurf, as the adjective in French variably could be placed both before and after a noun, also a reference to the Belgian saying chou vert et vert chou, lit cabbage green and green cabbage, \\"two sides of the same coin\\", by analogy implying that two things, though presented differently or appearing different, are the same or similar.  Plot summary  From the moment they first appeared in La Flûte à six trous in 1958 it was established that the Smurfs talked in Smurf language, where the term \\"smurf\\" was used on an apparently random basis in their speeches: for instance, \\"It's smurfing a gale today\\". Now it is revealed that actual differences in the language exist in the otherwise very homogenous community of Smurfs: the Smurfs who live in the northern part of their village use the term \\"smurf\\" as a noun; while the Smurfs in the south use it as an adjective or verb. This difference of opinion is raised when Handy Smurf, a Southern Smurf who is the local inventor, asks a Northern Smurf to return his \\"smurf opener\\", but he fails to do so on the grounds that it should be called a \\"bottle smurfer\\". Instead of agreeing to disagree, they have an increasingly heated argument about which is the correct term to use. Papa Smurf is locked away in his laboratory, trying to complete a difficult chemical experiment, which keeps him out of the argument. Meanwhile, other Smurfs start debating the linguistic issue. They part, returning to their own sides of the village, failing to agree on the subject, and as a result there is much tension in the air. One night, during a theatre performance of Little Smurf Riding Hood, the Northern part of the audience keeps interrupting the Southern actors over the use of language, claiming, among other things, that the title should be Little Red Riding Smurf. The arguing and interruptions continue to the point where the play erupts into an all-out fight. Papa Smurf breaks it up, pointing out the silliness of fighting over a matter of words. At first the Smurfs appear to think that he is right, but then start arguing again over whether they should \\"shake smurfs\\" or \\"smurf hands\\". The next day, Papa Smurf tries to lift the tension by insisting that they play ball together in a friendly manner. At first it appears to work, but then other Smurfs watching the game begin to divide along lingual lines and the arguments begin again. The tension returns, this time apparently to stay, with insults being traded and both sides trying to assert their indifference and superiority over the other. One Smurf eventually paints a demarcation line across the middle of the village to separate the two groups. This means that they have to stick to their own sides of the border. In one case, a Smurf finds his house marked in two by the straight demarcation line and goes almost crazy since he cannot figure out if he is of the North or the South: for instance, he cooks a \\"boiled smurf\\" on one side of his house and then consumes a \\"smurfed egg\\" on the other. All this time, Papa Smurf has been in his laboratory working on his experiment — the nature of which is never revealed — but when he finally succeeds and calls on the other Smurfs to celebrate, it is already too late: the fuse that was set long ago has exploded with both North and South finally coming to blows in an all-out battle. Papa Smurf's pleas for them to stop are in vain. In a desperate move to restore order, Papa Smurf turns to Gargamel, the evil sorcerer and sworn enemy of the Smurfs. Looking him in the eye, Papa Smurf pronounces a magic spell that immediately causes him and Gargamel to exchange their physical appearances: Gargamel becomes Papa Smurf and Papa Smurf becomes Gargamel. Gargamel's cat Azrael is taken aback when he hears the voice of his master coming from Papa Smurf's body and goes his own way, overwhelmed by confusion. Papa Smurf (as Gargamel) and Gargamel (as Papa Smurf) return to the Smurf village together where the battle is still ongoing. However, upon seeing Gargamel attack, the Smurfs on both sides reunite to fight against their common archenemy. Papa Smurf (as Gargamel) allows himself to be subdued and tied down. He hoped to teach them a lesson in being united (\\"smurf for all and all for smurf\\"), but they mock his claim to actually be Papa Smurf and refuse to release him. The real Gargamel, in Papa Smurf's body, breaks into the laboratory and finds the magic spell. He thus restores himself and Papa Smurf into their original bodies, freed from the bonds. Gargamel immediately takes the opportunity to chase and seize the Smurfs throughout the village and further into the woods. But then he and the Smurfs come across Azrael who attacks him, thinking that it's still Papa Smurf in Gargamel's body. All the Smurfs successfully escape from Gargamel's hands, while Gargamel (as usual) fails to find his way back to their village. At first it would seem as if peace has returned but then Papa Smurf overhears another argument about whether it should be a \\"smurf opener\\" or a \\"bottle smurfer\\". To prevent further clashes, he decrees that all the terms pronounced differently on the north and south sides of the village are now banned from use, so it should henceforth be \\"an object to unscrew bottles\\". However, the Smurfs find it very difficult to use this new politically correct language, since very complicated and descriptive forms of expression are now needed and are subject to different interpretations, meaning that the resolution of the linguistic issue is still a long way off, and that the dialectal differences still persist.  Publication history  Smurf vs. Smurf was originally published in issues 1808 to 1836 of Spirou magazine in 1972bdoubliees.com and then in book form by Dupuis in 1973. As well as the original French, other translations include English (as Smurf Of One And Smurf A Dozen Of The Other), Dutch, German, Swedish, Spanish, Italian, Danish, Serbo-Croatian, Polish, Catalan and Chinese.Zilveren Dolfijn lists translations of this story, with covers  Issues  In this story, Peyo and Yvan Delporte make open political comments about the still ongoing language conflict between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in Belgium. The story also illustrates how easily systems with undeveloped institutions fall into disarray as the few authorities that there are suddenly stop functioning:Images du Totalitarisme en bandes dessinées by Paul Guillerm Papa Smurf is the only regular decision-making body in the community of Smurfs and his failure to get involved in the debate leads to the breakdown of order. Brainy Smurf is the only other neutral figure in the plot, but his attempts to resolve the issue with the help of a grammar book fall on deaf ears given the low opinion that the other Smurfs have of him.

Narsing Rao, based on a play by Krishan Chander on the Telangana Rebellion in Hyderabad State. The directorial debut of Goutam Ghose, depicts a typical life of villagers under feudalistic society in the Telangana region. Maa Bhoomi was India's official entry in the \\"Opera Primo\\" section at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival of June-July 1980, and the Cork Film Festival, October 1980, the Cairo and Sidney Film Festivals 1980. The film was showcased at the Indian Panorama of the 1980 International Film Festival of India. Maa Bhoomi won the state Nandi Award for Best Feature Film, and the Filmfare Best Film Award (Telugu). It is featured among CNN-IBN's list of hundred greatest Indian films of all time.  Plot  The film follows the story of a young landless Telangana peasant named Ramaiah (Sai Chand) from Siripuram, Nalgonda, a region under foreign rule. The British have appointed the Nizam as the region's governor. The Nizam in turn have appointed the Reddys and the Patils as the Zamindars (Known locally as Doras) of the region who collect taxes among various other things for the Nizam. Further, the Nizam have granted them with titles, Jagirs and judicial rights enabling them to seize thousands of acres of land from the peasants, turning them into tenants. Ramaiah rebels against the corrupt Nizam leadership in Hyderabad. When his wife has to submit to sexual coercion by the officials, he befriends the Communists and participates in the independence struggle. The peasants form various paramilitary groups and launch guerilla warfare attacks across the region with country made weapons. They raid and take over regional Dora bases across rural Telangana at night and burn all the land documents found in the bases in the open yard symbolising their triumph. Eventually, they take over the village after the Indian Independence. The Doras manage to escape to Hyderabad reporting the events to the Nizam leadership. The Nizam commands the Razakars, a private Islamist militia, which perpetrates a massacre of the Telangana peasants. After months of burning, looting, rapes and killings, the Indian army marches into Hyderabad and suppresses the Razakars and the Nizam with Operation Polo in September 1948 and annexes the Telangana region back into the Indian Union. In independent India, the Zamindars (Doras) are returned to power by joining the Congress government. The Doras have abandoned the Nizam and pledged allegiance to the Congress Party.

The lower part is named Log, the middle part Plest or Plestje (it is a mostly wooded area), and the upper part Kot (literally 'cirque') or Ogradec (it is a wooded area with scree slopes). Altogether 35 people live on the isolated farmsteads in the valley. =Peaks= View from above 360° view on video The Logar Valley is ringed by the following peaks: Strelovec (), Krofička (), Ojstrica (), Lučka Baba (), Planjava (), Brana (), Turska Gora (), and Mrzla Gora (). It terminates in a head wall beneath the Okrešelj Cirque, where the Savinja River starts at an ice-cold spring at an elevation of 1,280 meters and flows to Rinka Falls. =Climate= Although the Logar Valley is not particularly narrow (about 500 m at its narrowest), inversions are very common due to the influence of a northern anticyclone. Temperature distributions on the slopes are greatly influenced by differences between the sunny and shady areas, which is seen in different snow and ice conditions in the winter.

The uprising occurred on the east bank of the Mississippi River in what is now St. John the Baptist, St. Charles and Jefferson Parishes, Louisiana. While the slave insurgency was the largest in US history, the rebels killed only two white men. Confrontations with militia and executions after trial killed 95 black people. Between 64 and 125 enslaved men marched from sugar plantations in and near present-day LaPlace on the German Coast toward the city of New Orleans.Mary Ann Sternberg, Along the River Road: Past and Present on Louisiana's Historic Byways, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2001, p. 12 They collected more men along the way. Some accounts claimed a total of 200 to 500 slaves participated. During their two-day, twenty-mile march, the men burned five plantation houses (three completely), several sugarhouses, and crops. They were armed mostly with hand tools.Eugene D. Genovese, Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made, New York: Vintage Books, 1976, p. 592 White men led by officials of the territory formed militia companies, and in a battle on January 10 killed 40 to 45 of the escaped slaves while suffering no fatalities themselves, then hunted down and killed several others without trial. Over the next two weeks, white planters and officials interrogated, tried, executed and decapitated an additional 44 escaped slaves who had been captured. Executions were generally by hanging or firing squad. Heads were displayed on pikes to intimidate other slaves. Since 1995, the African American History Alliance of Louisiana has led an annual commemoration in January of the uprising, in which they have been joined by some descendants of participants in the revolt.James W. Lowen, Lies Across America: What Our History Sites Get Wrong, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007, p. 192 Background Destrehan Plantation House, Louisiana The sugar boom on what was known as Louisiana's German Coast (named for immigrants in the 1720s) began after the American Revolutionary War, while the area near New Orleans was still controlled by Spain. In the 1780s, Jean Saint Malo, an escaped slave, established a colony of maroons in the swamps below New Orleans, which eventually led Spanish officials to send militia, who captured him. St. Malo became a folk hero after his execution in New Orleans on June 19, 1784. A decade later, during the height of the French Revolution, Spanish officials discovered a slave conspiracy at Pointe Coupee (established by French settlers around 1720 between Natchez and New Orleans). That slave uprising during the Easter holidays was suppressed before it came to fruition, and resulted in 23 executions by hanging (with the decapitated heads then displayed on the road to New Orleans) and 31 additional slaves were flogged and sent to serve hard labor in other Spanish outposts.Rasmussen pp. 88–90 After the Haitian slave revolution, planters attempted to establish similar lucrative sugarcane plantations on the Gulf Coast, resulting in a dense slave population. They converted from cotton and indigo plantations to sugar cane, so that by 1802, 70 sugar plantations produced over 3,000 tons in a year.Rasmussen p. 47 However, they replicated the brutal conditions which had led to numerous revolts in Haiti—the high profits were made by working slaves longer hours and punishing them more brutally, so that they lived shorter lives than any other slave society in North America.Rasmussen p. 49 Some accounts claimed blacks outnumbered whites by nearly five to one by 1810, and about 90% of whites in the area owned slaves. More than half of those enslaved may have been born outside Louisiana, many in Africa, where various European nations established slave trading outposts and Kongo was ripped apart by civil wars. After the U.S. negotiated the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, both the Marquis de Lafayette and James Monroe declined to become the Territorial Governor. President Thomas Jefferson then turned to a fellow Virginian, William C.C. Claiborne, whom he appointed on an interim basis, and who arrived in New Orleans with 350 volunteers and eighteen boats. Claiborne struggled with the area's diverse population, particularly as he spoke neither French nor Spanish. The population also included a larger proportion of native Africans among the slaves than elsewhere in the U.S. In addition, the mixed- race Creole and French-speaking population grew markedly with refugees from Haiti (and their slaves) following the successful Haitian slave revolution. Claiborne was not used to a society with the number of free people of color that Louisiana had, but he worked to continue their role in the militia that had been established under Spanish rule. Long-term French Creole residents complained to Washington, D.C. about Claiborne and new U.S. settlers in the territory, and wanted no part of President Jefferson's plan to pay 30,000 Americans to move into the new territory and amalgamate with the residents. Thus, by 1805, a delegation led by Jean Noël Destréhan went to Washington to complain about the \\"oppressive and degrading\\" form of the territorial government, but President Madison continued to support Claiborne, who had expressed great doubts about the planters' honesty and trustworthiness.Rasmussen pp. 52–58 Lastly, Claiborne suspected that the Spanish in nearby West Florida might encourage an insurrection. Thus, he struggled to establish and maintain his authority. In the overall Territory of Orleans, from 1803 to 1811, the free black population nearly tripled, to 5,000, with 3,000 arriving as migrants from Haiti (via Cuba) in 1809–1810. In Saint-Domingue they had enjoyed certain rights as gens de couleur, including owning slaves themselves.Nathan A. Buman, \\"To Kill Whites: The 1811 Louisiana Slave Insurrection \\", Louisiana State University, August 2008, pp. 32–33, 37, 51, 58. Retrieved January 18, 2013. Furthermore, between 1790 and 1810, slave traders brought around 20,000 enslaved Africans to New Orleans.Rasmussen pp. 90 The waterways and bayous around New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain made transportation and trade possible, but also provided easy escapes and nearly impenetrable hiding places for runaway slaves. Some maroon colonies continued for years within several miles of New Orleans. With the spread of ideas of freedom from the French and Haitian revolutions, European-Americans worried about slave uprisings, particularly in the Louisiana area. In 1805, they heard a traveling Frenchman was preaching about liberty, equality and fraternity to the French-speaking slaves, and arrested him as dangerous.Rasmussen pp. 89–90 Rebellion =Beginning= A group of enslaved plantation workers met on January 6, 1811. It was a period when work had relaxed on the plantations after the fierce weeks of the sugar harvest and processing. As planter James Brown testified weeks later, \\"The black Quamana [Kwamena, meaning \\"born on Saturday\\"], owned by Mr. Brown, and the mulatto Harry, owned by Messrs. Kenner and Henderson, were at the home of Manuel Andry on the night of Saturday–Sunday of the current month in order to deliberate with the mulatto Charles Deslondes, chief of the brigands.\\" Slaves had spread word of the planned uprising among the slaves at plantations up and down the \\"German Coast\\", along the Mississippi River. The revolt began on January 8 at the Andry plantation.Manuel Andry (1757–1839) in the Dictionary of Louisiana Biography [Scroll down to Andry.] Retrieved 15 April 2017. After striking and badly wounding Manuel Andry, the slaves killed his son Gilbert. \\"An attempt was made to assassinate me by the stroke of an axe,\\" Andry wrote. \\"My poor son has been ferociously murdered by a horde of brigands who from my plantation to that of Mr. Fortier have committed every kind of mischief and excesses, which can be expected from a gang of atrocious bandittis of that nature.\\" =Escalation= The rebellion gained momentum quickly. The 15 or so slaves at Andry's plantation, about upriver from New Orleans, joined another eight slaves from the next-door plantation of the widows of Jacques and Georges Deslondes. This was the home plantation of Charles Deslondes, a slave driver (overseer who was himself enslaved) later described by one of the captured slaves as the \\"principal chief of the brigands.\\" Small groups of slaves joined from every plantation the rebels passed. Witnesses remarked on their organized march. They carried mostly pikes, hoes and axes, but few firearms, and they marched to drums while some carried flags. From 10–25% of any given plantation's slave population joined with them. At the plantation of James Brown, Kook, one of the most active participants and key figures in the story of the uprising, joined the insurrection. At the next plantation down, Kook attacked and killed François Trépagnier with an axe. He was the second and last planter killed in the rebellion. After the band of slaves passed the LaBranche plantation, they stopped at the home of the local doctor. Finding the doctor gone, Kook set his house on fire. Some planters testified at the trials in parish courts that they were warned by their slaves of the uprising. Others regularly stayed in New Orleans, where many had town houses, and trusted their plantations to overseers to run. Planters quickly crossed the Mississippi River to escape the insurrection and to raise a militia. As the slave party moved downriver, they passed larger plantations, from which many slaves joined them. Numerous slaves joined the insurrection from the Meuillion plantation, the largest and wealthiest plantation on the German Coast. The rebels laid waste to Meuillion's house. They tried to set it on fire, but a slave named Bazile fought the fire and saved the house. After nightfall the slaves reached Cannes-Brulées, about northwest of New Orleans. The men had traveled between , a march that probably took them seven to ten hours. By some accounts, they numbered \\"some 200 slaves,\\" although other accounts estimated up to 500.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619–1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 156 As typical of revolts of most classes, free or slave, the insurgent slaves were mostly young men between the ages of 20 and 30. They represented primarily lower-skilled occupations on the sugar plantations, where slaves labored in difficult conditions with a low life expectancy. =Suppression= Despite his axe-wound, Col. Andry crossed the river to contact other planters and round up a militia, which pursued the rebel slaves. By noon on January 9, people in New Orleans had heard about the German Coast insurrection. By sunset, General Wade Hampton I, Commodore John Shaw, and Governor William C.C. Claiborne sent two companies of volunteer militia, 30 regular troops, and a detachment of 40 seamen to fight the slaves. By about 4 a.m. on January 10, the New Orleans forces had reached Jacques Fortier's plantation, where Hampton thought the escaped slaves had encamped overnight. However, the escaped slaves had started back upriver about two hours before, traveled about back up the coast and neared Bernard Bernoudy's plantation. There, planter Charles Perret, under the command of the badly injured Andry and in cooperation with Judge St. Martin, had assembled a militia of about 80 men from the river's opposite side. At about 9 o'clock, this local militia discovered slaves moving toward high ground on Bernoudy's plantation. Perret ordered his militia to attack the rebel slaves, which he later wrote numbered about 200 men, about half on horseback. (Most accounts said only the leaders were mounted, and historians believe it unlikely the slaves could have gathered so many mounts.) Within a half-hour, 40 to 45 slaves had been killed; the remainder slipped away into the woods and swamps. Perret and Andry's militia tried to pursue them despite the difficult terrain. On January 11, militia, assisted by Native American trackers as well as hunting dogs, captured Charles Deslondes, whom Andry considered \\"the principal leader of the bandits.\\" A slave driver and son of a white man and a slave, Deslondes received no trial or interrogation. Samuel Hambleton described his execution as having his hands chopped off, \\"then shot in one thigh & then the other, until they were both broken – then shot in the Body and before he had expired was put into a bundle of straw and roasted!\\" His cries under the torture could intimidate other escaped slaves in the marshes. The following day Pierre Griffee and Hans Wimprenn, who were thought the murderers of M. Thomassin and M. François Trépagnier, were captured, killed, and their heads hacked off for delivery to the Andry estate. Major Milton and the dragoons from Baton Rouge arrived and provided support for the militia, since Governor Hampton believed them supported by the Spanish in West Florida.Rasmussen pp. 142–43 Aftermath =Trials= Having suppressed the insurrection, the planters and government officials continued to search for slaves who had escaped. Those captured later were interrogated and jailed before trials. Officials convened three tribunals: one at Destrehan Plantation owned by Jean Noël Destréhan in (St. Charles Parish), one in St. John the Baptist Parish, and the third in New Orleans (Orleans Parish). The Destrehan trials, overseen by Judge Pierre Bauchet St. Martin, resulted in the execution of 18 of 21 accused slaves by firing squad.\\"Jean Noël Destrehan\\" by John H. Lawrence, KnowLouisiana.org Encyclopedia of Louisiana. Ed. David Johnson. Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, 18 Jun 2013. Web. 15 Apr 2017.Rasmussen p. 156 Some slaves testified against others, but others refused to testify nor submit to the all- planter tribunal. In New Orleans, Commodore Shaw presumed that \\"but few of those who have been taken were acquitted.\\" The New Orleans trials resulted in the conviction and summary executions of 11 more slaves. Three were publicly hanged in the Place d'Armes, now Jackson Square. One of those spared was a thirteen-year-old boy, who was ordered to witness another slave's death and then received 30 lashes. Another slave was treated with leniency because his uncle turned him in and begged for mercy. The sentence of a third slave was commuted because of the valuable information he had given.Rasmussen p. 148 The heads of the executed were put on pikes, and the mutilated bodies of dead rebels displayed to intimidate other slaves. By the end of January, nearly 100 heads were displayed on the levee from the Place d'Armes in central New Orleans along the River Road to the plantation district and Andry's plantation, nearly quadrupling the number of heads nailed to posts from New Orleans to Pointe Coupee after the 1795 slave uprising.Rasmussen pp. 148–50 U.S. territorial law provided no appeal from a parish court's ruling, even in cases involving imposition of a death sentence on an enslaved individual. Governor Claiborne, recognizing that fact, wroteJanuary 16, 1811, and January 19, 1811, Rowland, Dunbar, ed. Official Letter Books of WCC Claiborne, 1801–1816. Vol. 5. State department of archives and history, 1917, pp. 100–01, 107–08. to the judges of each court that he was willing to extend executive clemency (\\"in all cases where circumstances suggest the exercise of mercy a recommendation to that effect from the Court and Jury, will induce the Governor to extend to the convict a pardon.\\") In fact, Gov. Claiborne did commute two death sentences, those of Henry,Carter, 1940, p. 983 and of Theodore,Carter, 1940, p. 982; Rowland, pp. 198–99 each referred by the Orleans Parish court.Eaton, Fernin (November 7, 2011). \\"Slave Uprising; Governor on Trial: Claiborne in His Own Words\\". Salon publique, Pitot House, New Orleans. Academia.edu. Retrieved February 19, 2015 No record has been found of any referral from the court in St. Charles Parish, or of any refusal by the Governor of any application for clemency. =Outcome= Militias killed about 95 slaves between the battle, subsequent summary apprehensions and executions, as well as by execution after trials. From the trial records, most of the leaders appeared to have been mixed-race Creoles or mulattoes, although numerous slaves were native-born Africans. Fifty-six of the slaves captured on the 10th and involved in the revolt were returned to their masters, who may have punished them but wanted their valuable laborers back to work. Thirty more slaves were captured, but returned to their masters after planters determined they had been forced to join the revolt by Charles Deslondes and his men. The heirs of Meuillon petitioned the legislature for permission to free the mulatto slave Bazile, who had worked to preserve his master's plantation. Not all the slaves supported insurrection, knowing the trouble it could bring and not wanting to see their homes and communities destroyed. As was typical of American slave insurrections, the uprising was short-lived and quickly crushed by local authorities. Showing planter influence, the legislature of the Territory of Orleans approved compensation of $300 to planters for each slave killed or executed. The Territory accepted the presence of U.S. troops after the revolt, as they were grateful for their presence. The national press covered the insurrection, with some Northerners seeing it arising out of the wrongs suffered under slavery. Legacy The uprising started in present-day LaPlace and followed a twenty-mile trek on the old River Road through the present-day towns of Montz, Norco, New Sarpy, Destrehan, St. Rose and ended at much of what had once been the Kenner and Henderson Plantations and is now Rivertown and Louis Armstrong International Airport (named after prominent African American musician Louis Armstrong) in Kenner. While the Destrehan Plantation tour concentrates on architecture and white lifestyle and family histories, a small museum in a converted slave cabin (not on the standard tour) features folk paintings of the 1811 uprising.Rasmussen pp. 199–201 Louisiana's historical marker for the former Andry plantation mentions \\"Major 1811 slave uprising organized here.\\"Marael Johnson, Louisiana, Why Stop?: A Guide to Louisiana's Roadside Historical Markers, Houston: Gulf Publishing Co., 1996, p. 52. Despite its size and connection to the French and Haitian revolutions, the rebellion is not thoroughly covered in history books. As late as 1923, however, older black men \\"still relate[d] the story of the slave insurrection of 1811 as they heard it from their grandfathers.\\"Lubin F. Laurent, \\"A History of St. John the Baptist Parish\\", Louisiana Historical Quarterly, 7 (1924), pp. 324–25. The Whitney Plantation, in St. John the Baptist Parish, opened in 2014 and is the first plantation museum in the country dedicated to the slave experience. The Whitney Plantation includes a memorial and information to commemorate the 1811 Slave Uprising of the German Coast. Since 1995, the African American History Alliance of Louisiana has led an annual commemoration at Norco in January, where they have been joined by some descendants of members of the revolt. In 2015, artist Dread Scott began organizing a massive re-enactment of the uprising; the 26 mile, 2-day event took place in November 2019. Rick Rojas, \\"'Join Us!

Statement In nominal terms, government must pay off its existing domestic liabilities (government debt denominated in local currency units) either by refinancing (rolling over the debt, issuing new debt to pay the old) or amortizing (paying it off from surpluses in tax revenue). In real terms, a government can also inflate away the debt: if it causes or allows high inflation, the real amount it must repay will be smaller. Alternatively, it could default on its obligations. The fiscal theory states that if a government has an unsustainable fiscal policy, such that it will not be able to pay off its obligation in future out of tax revenue (it runs a persistent structural deficit), then it will pay them off via inflating the debt away. Thus, fiscal discipline, meaning a balanced budget over the course of the economic cycle is necessary for the price level to remain stable; unsustainable deficits will require inflation in future. History The fiscal theory of the price level was developed primarily by Eric M. Leeper (1991), Christopher A. Sims (1994), and Michael Dean Woodford (1994, 1995, 2001). It has been criticized by Narayana Kocherlakota and Christopher Phelan, Willem Buiter (2002), Bennett T. McCallum (1999, 2001, 2003), Oscar Arce, and Dirk Niepelt.

A microwave oven is an example of this principle put to controlled, safe use. Radio-frequency (RF) energy is non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation – its effects on tissue are through heating. Electronic components are affected via rectification of the RF and a corresponding shift in the bias points of the components in the field. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) set limits for the amounts of RF energy exposure permitted in a standard work-day. History The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and industry EMC leaders have periodically met to define the adequacy of protection requirements for civil avionics from outside interference since 1980. In 1986 The FAA Technical Center contracted for a definition of the electromagnetic environment for civil aviation. This study was performed by the Electromagnetic Compatibility Analysis Center (ECAC). The study has shown levels of exposure to this threat as high as four orders of magnitude (10000 times) higher than the then current civil aircraft EMC susceptibility test certification standards of 1 volt/meter (DO-160). This environment was also two orders of magnitude higher (100 times) than the then prevailing military avionics systems test standards (MIL-STD 461/462). Units of measurement An RF electromagnetic wave has both an electric and a magnetic component (electric field and magnetic field), and it is often convenient to express the intensity of the RF environment at a given location in terms of units specific to each component. For example, the unit \\"volts per meter\\" (V/m) is used to express the strength of the electric field (electric \\"field strength\\"), and the unit \\"amperes per meter\\" (A/m) is used to express the strength of the magnetic field (magnetic \\"field strength\\").

Of the of U.S. 2 in Minnesota, have four lanes, mostly located in the northwest part of the state. Route description US 2 enters the state from the west at the city of East Grand Forks, at the Red River. From the North Dakota state line to Cass Lake, US 2 is a four lane divided highway for . This expressway portion of US 2 in northwest Minnesota passes through the cities of East Grand Forks, Crookston, Erskine, Fosston, Bagley, Bemidji, and Cass Lake. The portion of US 2 from Bemidji to Cass Lake is officially designated the Paul Bunyan Expressway. After Cass Lake, US 2 continues east as a two lane roadway for 40 miles to Deer River. East of Deer River, US 2 is a four lane divided highway for seven miles (11 km) until the city of Grand Rapids, where it has a junction with US 169\\\\. US 2 then heads southeast as a two lane roadway for to the unincorporated area of Saginaw, where it has an interchange with State Highway 33 (MN 33). The route then continues east for two miles to its intersection with MN 194 at Solway Township. US 2 then continues southeast for before entering the city of Proctor, where it is the main street through town. The route widens to a three-lane roadway as it approaches its intersection with Boundary Avenue (County Road 14). The route enters the city limits of Duluth, where it has a junction with Interstate 35 (I-35), US 2 joins that route's freeway. US 2 is concurrent with I-35 for two miles (3.2 km) in West Duluth, proceeding down Thompson Hill. US 2 then exits the I-35 freeway in West Duluth and crosses the Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge over the Saint Louis Bay, entering the state of Wisconsin and the city of Superior. US 2 then follows Belknap Street in Superior. Legally, the Minnesota section of US 2 is defined as Constitutional Route 8 and Legislative Route 106 in the Minnesota Statutes §§ 161.114(2) and 161.115(134). The route is not marked with those numbers. History U.S. Highway 2 in Minnesota was authorized on November 11, 1926. It followed the route of old state Trunk Highway 8 in its entirety. At the time it was marked, it was paved along a short concurrency with U.S. Route 75 north of Crookston and from its junction with then-Trunk Highway 11 (present-day U.S. 53) through Duluth. The remainder was graveled or graded, except for a section west of Bagley which was simply a maintained dirt surface. The route in Minnesota was completely paved in 1939. The last segment to be completed was between then- State Highway 94 (now Highway 194) at Solway Township and the community of Adolph. A few short (four-lane) divided highway segments of US 2 were constructed west of Bemidji during the 1960s. In the present day, from East Grand Forks to Cass Lake, this route is built to expressway standards and a posted speed limit. From Cass Lake to Duluth, there are only a couple of short four-lane divided highway segments, but the non-urban portions of this segment are posted speed limit.

They are often loosely called \\"hammerhead worms\\" or \\"broadhead planarians\\" because of the distinctive shape of their head region. Land planarians are unique in that they possess a \\"creeping sole\\" on their ventral side. Several species are considered as invasive to the United StatesOgren, R.E. 1985. The human factor in the spread of an exotic land planarian in Pennsylvania. Proc. of the Penn. Acad. of Sci. 59: 117-118. and to Europe. Some studies have begun the investigation of the evolutionary ecology of these invasive planarians.  Description  The genus Bipalium was initially defined by Stimpson to include land planarians with the head broadened, forming a head plate. Later, in 1899, Ludwig von Graff divided it into three genera according to the shape of the head: #Bipalium: with a well-developed head plate, much broader than long, and with elongated lateral auricles #Perocephalus: rudimentary head plate, not much broader than the body #Placocephalus: flat head plate with a circular outline Josef Müller, in 1902, considered that no sufficient anatomical basis existed for this distinction, and reunited them under Bipalium. Later, von Graff accepted Müller's conclusions. Towards the end of the 20th century, Robert E. Ogren and Masaharu Kawakatsu started a series of publications called \\"The Land Planarian Index series\\" in which they reviewed and organized all taxonomic information regarding land planarians. At first, they retained all broad-headed planarians in the genus Bipalium, but later split them into four genera based on the anatomy of the reproductive organs: Bipalium, Novibipalium, Humbertium, and Diversibipalium. Under this scenario, the genus Bipalium is defined as containing broad-headed land planarians with simple copulatory organs, without accessory ducts or copulatory bursa, and with a fold of tissue separating the male and female exit ducts.  Etymology  The name Bipalium comes from Latin bi-, “two” + pala, “shovel” or “spade”, because species in this genus resemble a pickaxe.  Species  The genus Bipalium currently includes the following species: *Bipalium adensameri Graff, 1899 *Bipalium admarginatum de Beauchamp, 1933 *Bipalium adventitium Hyman, 1943 *Bipalium alternans de Beauchamp, 1930 *Bipalium bergendali (Graff, 1899) *Bipalium cantori (Wright, 1860) *Bipalium choristosperma de Beauchamp, 1925 *Bipalium crassatrium de Beauchamp, 1939 *Bipalium distinguendum Müller, 1907 *Bipalium dubium Loman, 1890 *Bipalium ephippium Loman, 1890 *Bipalium fuscatum Stimpson, 1857 *Bipalium fuscolineatum Kaburaki, 1922 *Bipalium gestroi Graff, 1894 *Bipalium glandiantrum Kawakatsu, Sluys & Ogren, 2005 *Bipalium glaucum (Kaburaki, 1922) *Bipalium gracile Loman, 1890 *Bipalium graffi Müller, 1903 *Bipalium haberlandti Graff, 1899 *Bipalium hilgendorfi (Graff, 1899) *Bipalium interruptum Graff, 1899 *Bipalium javanum Loman, 1883 *Bipalium kaburakii Kawakatsu, Sluys & Ogren, 2005 *Bipalium katoi Kawakatsu, Sluys & Ogren, 2005 *Bipalium kewense Moseley, 1878 *Bipalium kisoense Kaburaki, 1922 *Bipalium koreense Frieb, 1923 *Bipalium kraepelini (Ritter-Záhony, 1905) *Bipalium marginatum Loman, 1887 *Bipalium mjobergi de Beauchamp, 1925 *Bipalium monolineatum Kaburaki, 1922 *Bipalium moseleyi Loman, 1887 *Bipalium muninense Kawakatsu, Sluys & Ogren, 2005 *Bipalium myadenosum de Beauchamp, 1939 *Bipalium nigrum (Ritter-Záhony, 1905) *Bipalium nobile Kawakatsu & Makino, 1982 *Bipalium ochroleucum Kaburaki, 1922 *Bipalium pennsylvanicum Ogren, 1987 *Bipalium penrissenicum Kawakatsu, Ogren & Froehlich, 1998 *Bipalium penzigi Müller, 1903 *Bipalium persephone de Beauchamp, 1939 *Bipalium poiense de Beauchamp, 1925 *Bipalium rigaudi Graff, 1894 *Bipalium robiginosum Graff, 1899 *Bipalium semperi (Graff, 1899) *Bipalium simrothi Loman, 1895 *Bipalium strubelli Graff, 1899 *Bipalium sudzuki Kawakatsu, 1986 *Bipalium tetsuyai Kawakatsu, Sluys & Ogren, 2005 *Bipalium univittatum Grube, 1866 *Bipalium vagum Jones & Sterrer, 2005 *Bipalium virile Müller, 1903 *Bipalium weismanni Ritter-Záhony, 1905 *Bipalium wiesneri Graff, 1899  Feeding habits  Bipalium species are predatory. Some species prey on earthworms, while others may also feed on mollusks. These flatworms can track their prey. When captured, earthworms begin to react to the attack, but a flatworm uses the muscles in its body, as well as sticky secretions, to attach itself to the earthworm to prevent escape. The planarians cover, or cap, the prostomium, peristomium, and anterior end to stop the violent reaction by the earthworm. To feed on their prey, species of Bipalium often evert their pharynges from their mouths, located on the midventral portion of their bodies, and secrete enzymes that begin the digestion of the prey. The liquefied tissues are sucked into the branching gut of the flatworms by ciliary action.  Reproduction  Reproduction in Bipalium may be asexual or sexual and all species are hermaphroditic. B. adventitium reproduces sexually and creates egg capsules, which hatch around 3 weeks post-deposition. The egg capsules have a tough exterior and generally contain multiple juveniles. B. kewense have rarely been observed using egg capsules as a primary method of reproduction. Asexual fragmentation is its main reproductive strategy in temperate regions and most individuals never develop sexual organs. Juveniles of this species, unlike B. adventitium, do not appear the same coloration as parents in their early days.  Toxicity  Recently, the presence of tetrodotoxin, a very potent neurotoxin, was recorded in B. adventitium and B. kewense. It is the first record of tetrodotoxin in terrestrial invertebrates.  Invasive species  Drawings of the anterior region of 6 species of the genus Bipalium, 5 of which are invasive species, showing the differences in shape and color. Little is known about the ecology of terrestrial planarians, but research has been done on different genera and species, including several native and invasive species in Brazil, Arthurdendyus triangulatus,Jones, H.

The dramas are performed mainly in the Roman Konkani dialects and include music, dancing and singing. Tiatr performers are called tiatrists. Etymology Tiatr is a popular form of Konkani theatre. Seen here is Tomazinho Cardozo. The word tiatr comes from the Portuguese word for theatre, teatro. Earlier variations were Theatro, Thiatro and Tiatro. Description Tiatr today revolves around social, religious and political themes. It is considered to be a mirror of Goan culture. The drama consists of 6 or 7 acts called pordhe . The acts are interspersed by songs which need not be directly linked to the content or the issues of the main drama. There are 2 or 3 songs between each of the acts. Tiatrist have always demonstrated a very high degree of social awareness. Most of the themes of tiatr are concerned with social problems confronting the people. The Tiatr is an instance where mass support plays a crucial role. It is one of those arts which despite centuries of Portuguese suppression and post-liberation neglect from the state governments, has not just survived but also thrived and reinvented itself in many ways. Photo shows an actor.The tiatr as a dramatic form has been traditionally dominated and patronised by Christian community, but over the years several young Hindu artists have been performing in the tiatr, which are also seen by people from the Hindu community. The lone Muslim so far has been mimicry artist Sheikh Amir. Songs Songs integral to the plays are known as 'Kants'. Other songs, called kantaram are generally either comedic or based on topical, political and controversial issues that are interspersed through the performance. These musical interludes are independent of the main theme of the play. The songs are often satirical and unsparing of the politics and politicians of Goa. The music is provided by a live band including keyboard, trumpet, saxophone, bass guitar and drums. Tiatr today Besides the regular commercial shows, tiatrs are held as part of the celebrations of nearly every church and chapel feast in the State. The Goa Kala Academy organises a state level Tiatr competition every year while the Tiatr Academy organises a Popular Tiatr competition for dramas which have exceeded 25 performances . Tiatr songs and performances are recorded and sold on CD and DVD in Goan and Middle Eastern markets. Although efforts have been made to preserve the art form as a tradition of Goa, there have been calls for greater recognition of Mumbai based tiatrists.'Mumbai-based tiatrists ignored'. Times of India. 2 June 2009. 2 June 2009 Times of India Khell tiatr There is another version of the Tiatr called the Khell Tiatr, whose performance is restricted to the festivals of Carnival, Intruz and Easter. It differs from the Konkani Tiatr in another respect, that is that its songs are integrated with the main drama and do not deviate in content from it. History 2018 stamp sheet dedicated to the 125th anniversary of the Goan Tiatr Prior to the emergence of tiatr, entertainment in Konkani was mainly through zagors and khells. Both of them had their distinct style. While the zagor was more lyrical, the khell had dialogues and while the former was more popular in Bardez, the latter was firmly entrenched in Salcete. Costancio Lucasinho Caridade Ribeiro, more popularly known as Lucasinho Ribeiro, who was from Assagao was seeking employment in Bombay. Passionate about the performing arts, he was highly impressed with the stylised Italian operas performed there. He took up a job for an Italian opera troupe which was touring Indian cities at the time, staging an opera called 'Italian Boy'. When the troupe left India, Lucazinho Ribeiro bought the costumes used in the play with the intention of staging a Konkani play on the style of the Italian Opera. His collaborators in the effort were Caetaninho Fernandes of Taleigao and João Agostinho Fernandes of Borda, Margao. On Easter Sunday, 17 April 1892 the first tiatr performance ever, Italian Bhurgo, adapted from the Italian play, was staged at the New Alfred Theatre, Bombay. This day is celebrated as Tiatr Dis (Tiatr Day). Hence, the Goan art form of tiatr was the product of the meeting of Goan culture and the opera of Italy, which, incidentally is the birthplace of the opera, and the tiatr was born in Bombay. Since there were many different scenes in this tiatr and as it required different stage sets, they thought of dropping the curtain and introducing songs and dances in front of the curtain. This was needed to entertain the audience while the Stage Setting was being done behind the curtain. These songs and dances did not have any relevance to the theme of the play. The first original tiatr script was written and directed by João Agostinho Fernandes, entitled Belle de Cavel or Sundori Cavelchi in 1895 in Bombay and for all his consistent devotion and encouragement over fifty years, he was conferred the title Pai Tiatrist (Father Tiatrist). Mrs. Regina Fernandes, wife of the playwright João Agostinho Fernandes, became the first female tiatr actor in \\"Bhattkara\\" on 22 November 1904. Divorce, a tiatr written and directed by Airistides Dias was the first konkani tiatr to complete 100 performances on 5 October 1980. However, as time passed the standard of Zagor as well as Khell deteriorated in quality with the introduction of elements of vulgarity. Educated people stopped patronizing the Zagor as well as the Khell. While tiatr was making its presence felt, its original form – the zagors and the khells – were dying a slow death and the zagor finally stopped being performed while the khells continued. But in 1956 the khell underwent a dramatic change. Given its state at that time, Antonio Moraes thought it fit to take the khell from the street performance to a stage performance. Helped by his friend and colleague Antonio Marian, the khell was performed on a stage for the first time with a backdrop and other paraphernalia associated with theatre. The first Khell Tiatr 'Sandlolo Put' written and directed by Antonio Moraes was staged on the third day of Carnival of March 1956. However, this form became very popular only in the 1970s when Rosario Rodrigues coined the term khell tiatr and came up with extremely successful shows. Thus, the ground-based plays known as Khells evolved onto the stage and further into 'Non-stop dramas' but have now generally dropped this label and are generally referred to as Tiatrs. Tiatr contributed to keeping the Konkani language alive during Portuguese colonial rule, when Konkani was suppressed. Tiatrists played a major role in the struggle to make Konkani the officials language of Goa. In 2007, the Government of Goa started the Tiatr Academy of Goa [ TAG ] to facilitate the development of Tiatr. In 2008 legislation was approved granting 15 lakh rupees to the newly formed Tiatr Academy of Goa.Tiatr; The tiatr story 11 April 2007 Goa Times Weekender List of tiatrists =Past tiatrists= =Active tiatrists= * Bushan Rodrigues * Braz de parra *Selvy * Fr.

Sweeting had gained extensive knowledge on various typographies by travelling to places such as Greece, Australia, Czechoslovakia, United States, Canada, South Africa, Belize, and most notably China. She published Karst Landforms (Macmillan 1972), and Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment (Springer 1995) after many years of work there starting in 1977; the latter is the first comprehensive Western account of China's karst. She created one of the first western published works on the karst found within China, even in a male dominated field. Early life Marjorie May Sweeting was born to George Scotland Sweeting and his wife Ellen Louisa Liddiard in Fulham in 1920. She was an only child, and her father was a geology lecturer at Imperial College, in London. Education Her secondary education took place in Mayfield School and later graduated in 1981 from Newham College, Cambridge. She was accepted as a Caroline Turle Research Fellow at Newnham College, Cambridge during 1942 for a year, later returning in 1945 for the Marion Kennedy Research. Career In 1987 Marjorie Sweeting retired from her position as Reader in Geography at The University of Oxford. She was also a Fellow and Tutor at St Hugh's College 1951-87 (Emeritus), and Lecturer and Reader at Oxford University 1954-87\\\\. During 1948, Sweeting became a PhD candidate who wrote her thesis based on The Landforms of the Carboniferous Limestone of Ingleborough District, N.W. Yorkshire. In 1951 Marjorie Sweeting was appointed Lecturer and Director of studies in Geography at St. Hugh's College, 1983 she was named the Acting head of the school. Sweeting served on the Karst Commission of the International Geographical Union, where she came to work on a new project titled, Man's Impact on the Karst. Additionally, Sweeting worked with Gordon Warwick in support of the International Speleological Union where she was in charge of the Karst Denudation. Another one of Marjorie's accomplishments in her career was being a leader on an exhibition called the “Expedition to Gunung Mulu”. The exhibition was held to observe speeds of erosion and how quickly land was being formed in a forest of equatorial conditions. A major feature of Marjorie Sweeting’s career was her influence on generations of undergraduates and graduates. Many were the Saturdays and vacation weeks she organized field trips for undergraduates, introducing them to caves and the pleasures of karstic landscapes. Achievements Sweeting contributed largely to the field of karst. Her many awards included those of Gill Memorial Prize of the Royal Geographical Society (1955), Certificate of Merit of the National Speleological Society of America (1959), Honorary Member of the Cave Research Foundation of America (1969), and the Busk medal (1980). Later life Upon her retirement in 1987, Sweeting continued her research on karst whilst in China, which resulted in her final academic work, “Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment,” which was published posthumously, in 1995. Other Marjorie Sweeting was a keen potholer and one way in which she introduced students to karst was to take them caving. Unable to continue her studies during World War II she went to Denbigh, North Wales as a geography teacher at Howells School. From 1977, when she led the initial expedition, Sweeting worked extensively on the karst landforms of China.Marjorie Sweetings book published after her initial retirement There was plenty of scope – karst covers about one-seventh of the country, over five hundred thousand square kilometers. This was the first study of the karst regions of China by a western geomorphologist. Marjorie was acknowledged not only as an international expert on karst geomorphology but also as a generous and enthusiastic mentor for generations of undergraduate and graduate students. For much of her career, Marjorie was one of only a small group of female physical geographers in Britain who fought hard and successfully to establish their international scientific reputation. After retirement, Marjorie Sweeting continued her research in China which culminated in ‘Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment’, the manuscript being published in 1995, shortly after her death. It is the first comprehensive Western account of China's karst. A special issue of ‘Zeitschrift für Geomorphologie’ on ‘Tropical and subtropical karst’ was published in her honour in 1997.

It is a publisher of poetry, fiction and non-fiction by Australian and overseas writers, and works in translation from Chinese, German, Spanish, French and Hindi. It also published HEAT magazine in two series from 1996 to 2012. Giramondo is supported by the Australia Council and Arts NSW. Its works are distributed by NewSouth.  History  Giramondo was founded by Ivor Indyk and Evelyn Juers, who have worked as its publishers up until the present day. The company’s initial publishing output was in the literary journal HEAT, which gave space to emerging and established authors both from Australia and overseas, often in translation. In 2001, Giramondo moved with Indyk to the University of Newcastle. In 2005, it moved again to join the Writing and Society Research Group at the University of Western Sydney’s Bankstown campus. It relocated its offices to the university’s campus in Parramatta, where it is currently based. Giramondo began its publication of poetry and fiction in 2002. The imprint has published titles by authors including Alexis Wright, Brian Castro, Judith Beveridge, Jennifer Maiden, Alan Wearne and Gerald Murnane. In recent years it has presided over the development of a literature based in Western Sydney, through the publication of books by Fiona Wright, Felicity Castagna, Luke Carman and Michael Mohammed Ahmad. In 2017, Giramondo launched its Southern Latitudes series with All My Goodbyes, a novel by Argentine author Mariana Dimópulos.https://giramondopublishing.com/giramondo-publishes-first-title-in- its-new-southern-latitudes-series/ The series aims to \\"bring together writers from the southern hemisphere, and to allow their work to strike resonances for Australian writers and readers\\". Giramondo also produces a series of short- form books of limited print run, which carry the tongue-in-cheek quote from Les Murray’s poem \\"The Dream of Wearing Shorts Forever\\": \\"It is time perhaps to cherish the culture of shorts.\\"  Cover design  Since the company’s inception, all of Giramondo’s covers have been designed by Australian designer Harry Williamson, including covers of HEAT. Poetry books all have a white spine; a fixed typographical layout; and three, thin-weighted black lines on the book’s front, each of which underscores the letters of the title, the author and the publisher. Williamson was inducted into the Design Institute of Australia Hall of Fame in 2013 and the Australian Publishers' Association Book Design Awards Hall of Fame in 2002.\\"Harry Williamson, Arts & Media\\", Tafe NSW.

In March 2015, the Futsal league, as well as the federation, formed their own body headed by Gerardo Paiz as head of Guatemalan Futsal. Paiz has provided Guatemala with many victories and titles in the last decade. Many believe that his leadership and isolation from the Federación Nacional de Fútbol, a group that most Guatemalans associate with corruption, has benefited futsal in the country. The Guatemalan futsal team was the host team of the FIFA Futsal World Cup in 2000 when it was held in Guatemala. It was the 4th Futsal World Cup held under FIFA. This world event launched the national squad and is seen as what catapulted Guatemala in the sport. The Guatemalan team has participated in four FIFA Futsal World Cups. World Cup Brazil 2008 Cycle Guatemala was the CONCACAF champion in 2008. Their home games are held in the Domo Polideportivo in Zone 13 in Guatemala City. Their best match was a 10–1 victory over China at the 2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup. Currently, the squad is ranked 27th in the world, 7th in the American continent and 3rd in CONCACAF. In late February, it was announced that Spaniard and experienced Tomas De Dios Lopez would become the new national head coach. Days later, in a press conference, the news were made official as well as a new kit deal with Joma that replaced Umbro.

It explores the notion of elastic motorcycles. The goal of each level is to touch the flower. Some require the player to collect apples spread throughout it before doing so. There is online competition in trying to finish the levels as fast as possible and setting new world records. Time improvements have often shown to rely on finding new ways to solve the levels. Betterment also relies on polishing known styles. Gameplay The player controls a motorbike rider, and has to restart the level if their head or bike's wheels touch a rotating spiky wheel, or their head touches a solid structure (such as a wall). All the apples in a level must be collected before the player can touch the flower and proceed to the next level. Only the head and wheels of the driver interact with the level, their body being able to overlap walls without injury. The physical model, such as the elasticity of the bike frame, permits a wide range of tricks to be performed. These range from subtle manoeuvres to increase speed to more dramatic effects, such as an exploit of a reproducible bug in the physical model, allowing for the bike to be propelled some distance up in the air. Versions Elasto Mania was created by Balázs Rózsa as a sequel to the 1997 game titled Action SuperCross. The main differences between both games are the slight change in physics and the addition of twelve internal levels. The demo version contains 18 official levels, while the full one contains 54. In addition to these official \\"internal\\" levels, many \\"external,\\" fan-created levels can be found online, in some cases gathered in level packs. The latest official patch for Elasto Mania is v1.11a. Development of unofficial patches have given rise to v1.3, which features online multiplayer. In August 2014, Elasto Mania 2 was released as an official iOS app. In 2017, Elasto Mania 2 was released on Microsoft Windows. In May 2020, an updated version of the original Elasto Mania was released on the Steam gaming platform. Online content In the early 2000s, players would join the IRC channel \\"#battle\\" and compete for the fastest completion time in player- designed levels. Replays of fast completion times were shared on the IRC channel with other players. A community-driven game patch was released since 2006, allowing players to see each other and compete in real-time. A website was launched conjointly with the development of online versions of the game, which features statistics and the ability to browse previously battled levels, examining their layout, commenting them, checking their all-time standings, and downloading their associated replays.

Accordingly, the US would not face a balance of payments crisis, because it purchased imports in its own currency. Exorbitant privilege as a concept cannot refer to currencies that have a regional reserve currency role, only global reserve currencies. Academically, the exorbitant privilege literature analyzes two empiric puzzles, the position and the income puzzle. The position puzzle consists of the difference between the (negative) U.S. net international investment position (NIIP) and the accumulated U.S. current account deficits, the former being much smaller than the latter. The income puzzle consists of the fact that despite a deeply negative NIIP, the U.S. income balance is positive, i.e. despite having much more liabilities than assets, earned income is higher than interest expenses.Curcuru, S. E., Thomas, C. P., & Warnock, F. E. (2013). On Return Differentials. International Finance Discussion Papers, 1077, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Origin The term was coined in the 1960s by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, then the French Minister of Finance.Barry Eichengreen, Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International monetary system It is frequently mis-attributed to Charles de Gaulle, who is said to have had similar views. Opposition in France In the Bretton Woods system put in place in 1944, U.S. dollars were convertible to gold. In France, it was called \\"America's exorbitant privilege\\" as it resulted in an \\"asymmetric financial system\\" where foreigners \\"see themselves supporting American living standards and subsidizing American multinationals\\". As American economist Barry Eichengreen summarized: \\"It costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries had to pony up $100 of actual goods in order to obtain one.\\" In February 1965 President Charles de Gaulle announced his intention to exchange its U.S. dollar reserves for gold at the official exchange rate. He sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the French reserve of gold and was followed by several countries. As it resulted in considerably reducing U.S. gold stock and U.S. economic influence, it led U.S. President Richard Nixon to end unilaterally the convertibility of the dollar to gold on August 15, 1971 (the \\"Nixon Shock\\"). This was meant to be a temporary measure but the dollar became permanently a floating fiat money and in October 1976, the U.S. government officially changed the definition of the dollar; references to gold were removed from statutes.Eugène White, Dominique Simard, Michael Bordo, La France et le système monétaire de Bretton Woods Margaret Garritsen de Vries, The International Monetary Fund, 1966–1971 Research Different attempts have been made across time to assess the validity of the exorbitant privilege hypothesis by estimating whether a statistically significant difference between the return on U.S. assets and liabilities exists. These endeavors encountered a major empirical problem in the unavailability of long time series on capital gains, which are required due to capital gains' volatility. In response to this issue, two approaches have developed: (1) the construction of long time series based on historical assumptions and (2) the focus on specific categories for which high-quality data exists. In the academic literature, three waves of research trying to assess the existence of exorbitant privilege are distinguished by Curcuru et al. (2013). The first wave occurred during the pre-crisis Great ModerationCf. Obstfeld & Rogoff (2005), Lane & Milesi-Ferretti (2005), Meissner & Taylor (2006), and Gourinchas & Rey (2007) and found, following the first research approach, significant annual return differentials favoring U.S. claims in a range between 2.7% and 3.7%, with Gourinchas and Rey (2007a) and Lane and Milesi- Ferretti (2005) finding particularly large differences for returns on both equity and debt assets. The first wave method consists of estimating capital gains by calculating the difference between the annual change in the U.S. international position and U.S. net capital outflows. The residual change not explained by capital flows is assumed to correspond to the capital gain. The second wave of research on the returns differentials literature, written during pre-crisis times and published during the crisis, emerged due to criticism of how the data was handled.Cf. Lane & Milesi-Ferretti (2009), Curcuru, Dvorak & Warnock (2008), Curcuru, Thomas & Warnock (2009), and Gourinchas & Rey (2007b). This criticism alleged inconsistencies in data revisions between stocks and flows, which were then (mis-)attributed to \\"Other changes\\". Consequently, it was argued that this estimation approach would not calculate capital gains, but rather the sum of capital gains and other changes. Another problem is the extent of gains in the FDI category, wherein data is estimated. The second wave addresses these issues and finds substantially smaller differentials, ranging from -0.7% to 0.6%, using the second research approach. The recent availability of new data finally spawned the third wave of research on returns differentials.Cf. Forbes (2010), Habib (2010), Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot (2010), and Gohrband & Howell (2010). This literature found comparatively high return differentials ranging up to 6.9% (Forbes (2010)) and attributed the difference more to differentials in capital gains than in yields (Habib (2010)). These findings have however since then come under criticism by Curcuru et al. (2013) who criticize Forbes (2010) for her focus on a sample situated in a period of solely dollar depreciation and Habib (2010) for using a first wave methodology. Revised estimates for Forbes (2010) accounting for the exchange rate effect find a difference of 4.6%, especially in FDI. More recent research by Curcuru et al. (2013) and Gohrband and Howell (forthcoming) estimates overall return differentials of 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The phrase became the title of a 2010 book by economist Barry Eichengreen, examining the future prospects for the US dollar's dominance in international trade.Exorbitant privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/International/?view=usa&ci;=9780199753789 Negative influences of being a reserve currency There are also negatives of being a reserve currency. Mainly, that it leads to a higher exchange rate, thereby reducing the competitiveness of export-reliant businesses abroad.

Adult Australian plague locusts range in size from 20 to 45 mm in length, and the colour varies from brown to green. In profile, the head is higher than the thorax, and the thorax has an X-shaped mark. The legs have a reddish shank and the wings are clear other than for a dark spot on the end. Range and habitat The locusts occur naturally in far northwestern New South Wales and the adjoining areas of Queensland and South Australia, as well as Western Australia. From these areas, the locusts can expand from time to time to be found in the agricultural areas of South Australia, New South Wales, including the Riverina, and Victoria. The locust can be found in a variety of grassland and open wooded habitats across the inland areas of the Australian mainland. Upper-level winds may occasionally carry locusts to coastal areas of the mainland and northern Tasmania and may establish populations in the eastern valleys of the Great Dividing Range; these populations usually fail to establish themselves for more than a few generations. Life-cycle A first- instar nymph of C. terminifera Adult locusts feeding on green shoots that follow rain within 24 to 48 hours in warmer months will mature and lay eggs within 5 to 7 days of a rain event. Using their ovipositors to drill a hole, locusts lay their eggs in the soil in a pod. Pods contain around 30 to 50 eggs and locusts lay two or three pods, 5 to 10 days apart. Egglaying often happens en masse, with as many as a million laid in a hectare of suitable soil. In good conditions (i.e. warm and moist), eggs take around two weeks to develop. After hatching, the nymphs take around 20–25 days to complete development in mid-summer. The locust has five instars, with the wings becoming more prominent with each moult. After the first and second instars, nymphs form aggregations known as bands; these tend to disperse by the fifth instar. Late- instar bands travel up to 500 m per day. Drier country has large bands congregating that are visible from the air, while in the agricultural regions, bands tend to be smaller. After its final moult—6 to 8 weeks after egglaying—the adult locust is called a fledgling. Fledglings have three development stages; a growth phase, where wings are strengthened and the exoskeleton hardened, a fat accumulation stage, and lastly, oocyte development. Gregarious populations of locusts form swarms, recurring in central Eastern Australia once every two or three years. The Australian plague locust is less gregarious than other locust species and swarms occur in a continuum from dense swarms through a range of densities down to scattered adults. Swarms may persist for days, dispersing and reforming while following the wind. Swarms may move up to 20 km in a day. Swarms can infest areas up to , although typical infestations are less than . Swarms can travel up to , tending to move with hot winds and generally towards the coast in most cases. Plagues bowling green at Berrigan, New South Wales in December 2010 When food and climatic conditions are favourable, huge swarms of locusts may develop. The first recorded swarm was in 1844, with further outbreaks from the 1870s onward. After 1900, the intensity and frequency of locust swarms increased, and since the 1920s, a pattern has developed of localised, high- density populations in some locations most years and less frequent major plagues over large areas persisting for one to two years. Infestations in Western Australia are less frequent. Widespread heavy inland rains, especially in summer, allow plague locusts to reach plague proportions with less regular rain maintaining these high-density populations. During these conditions, the lifecycle pattern may change to one in which the period from hatching to maturity is reduced to 2.5 months. Dry conditions reduce populations back to background levels. Due to its large range and frequent plagues, the Australian plague locust is the most damaging locust species in Australia. Damage is mainly confined to pasture, although crop damage can occur. Advanced winter crops have generally hardened off by early summer, when plague locusts become active and therefore are not favoured, but dry conditions and less advanced crops can be highly susceptible to locust infestation as can young autumn crops. Medium-density swarm of C. terminifera in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales in December 2010 Human Control Losses in a plague can amount to $3-4 million if protection barriers are ineffective. The Australian Plague Locust Commission is responsible for the monitoring and control of locust outbreaks using the control agent fipronil and growth regulators such as diflubenzuron in the juvenile nymphal stage. Two older-generation organophosphates, fenitrothion and chlorpyrifos, are also used occasionally for auxiliary, blanket spray runs, and the bioinsecticide 'Green Guard', made from a native fungal isolate of Metarhizium acridum. The latter is based on technology developed by CSIRO and the LUBILOSA programme, and now accounts for >12% of spray applications: for protected, organic farming, or environmentally susceptible areas such as water courses.

Looking towards Grey Street along Fitzroy Street from Albert Park in 1890, featuring the various buildings that made up the Terminus (now the George) Hotel. St Kilda Junction in the 1880s. From left to right, the streets visible are Wellington Street, High Street (now St Kilda Rd), Barkly Street and Fitzroy Street. The tram tracks turning right into Fitzroy Street are visible in front of the Junction Hotel. Fitzroy Street is the major thoroughfare of the beachside Melbourne suburb of St Kilda. Its fortunes have risen and fallen along with that of St Kilda itself, from wealthy residential district to a popular working and middle class beachside entertainment district, to cheap and seedy, and popular again in the late 20th century. In recent years Fitzroy Street itself has gone from a popular restaurant strip to the situation in 2017 where only a few restaurants remain amongst kebab shops and convenience stores catering the backpackers and many empty shopfronts. Fitzroy Street is named after Charles Augustus FitzRoy, Governor of New South Wales (which included the area of Victoria) in 1842 when St Kilda was first subdivided. It is a wide street running generally downhill from St Kilda Junction to the beach foreshore, the most direct road route from the Melbourne City Centre to the popular bay beach. It is an unusually wide street, with wide footpaths and space for a separate tram line right of way, and the two sides have quite different characters. It is sometimes closed to traffic for major events such as the St Kilda Festival, the Melbourne Marathon, and the Melbourne Pride March. The eastern section of the street from St Kilda Junction to Grey Street comprises medium rise apartment buildings on the south side overlooking Albert Park and Lake and the Junction Oval on the north. The corner of Grey Street is dominated by The George, originally a large hotel, now apartments and hospitality spaces. From Grey Street to The Esplanade, the south side is entirely lined with shops, many with apartments or hotels above. Leo's Spaghetti Bar is the most well known eatery, an early Italian restaurant and gelateria which was opened during the 1956 Summer Olympics. Opposite The George is the former St Kilda railway station, opened in 1857, converted to retail and other uses when the train line was converted to become part of route 96 in 1987, which continues into Fitzroy Street, where it joins route 16. Tram routes 3, 16, 96 all run down the street. Like St Kilda as a whole, Fitzroy Street in the middle to late 19th century was mainly a wealthy residential address, lined with grand houses, terraces and hotels. During the interwar years, the mansions were converted to flats or private hotels, and shops built in their front gardens, while others were replaced by flats with shops on the ground floor. The prominent Art Deco Prince of Wales Hotel replaced a Victorian era hotel of the same name on the corner of Acland Street in 1937. In the mid 20th century this development trend was continued, resulting in a continuous row of shops. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Fitzroy Street became the public face of the transformation of St Kilda from popular seaside entertainment and apartment living to red light district and cheap flats. The street featured cheap late night eateries, prostitution, drag cabaret shows, and The George hotel (renamed The Seaview) became a major venue for the punk and alternative music scene. The suburb and the street, and particularly the Prince of Wales Hotel, became a centre of LGBT culture in Melbourne in the 1980s, an association that continues as the location of the Midsumma Pride Parade since 1995, and in 2017 with the announcement that the Victorian Pride Centre would be located there.

Incorporated in 1887 as the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad from the reorganization of the Buffalo, New York, and Philadelphia, and reorganized in 1895 as the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railway, it was acquired and leased by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1900 and merged into the Penndel Company in 1955.Destroyed in 1968 in the name of Rochester's urban renewal, this station served first the WNY&PRR; and then the Pennsy. The route the line followed from Emporium, Pennsylvania across the state line to Olean, Hinsdale, Cuba, Belfast, and Rochester was laid, from Belfast north, on the bed of the abandoned Genesee Valley Canal. A house of Italianate design was purchased on Main Street West at Trowbridge Street and converted into the Rochester station. The 1895 to 1899 period saw revenue inadequate to pay the bond interest, and this was contemporaneous with the Pennsylvania's need to expand into western New York. Moreover, this expansion did not raise competitive issues with the Pennsy's principal rival, the New York Central. Thus, on 1 August 1900, the WNY&PRY; signed an agreement with the PRR under which the latter operated the former. Although the WNY&PRY; did not generate much profit in this arrangement, it did improve matters for the Allegheny Valley and the Philadelphia and Erie roads, so the net result was satisfactory to the Pennsylvania. Eventually, the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railway became the Pennsylvania Railroad's Buffalo and Allegheny Valley Division. (In a minor historical anomaly, note might be taken of the date of the small branch from Scottsville to Garbutt. While the route map clearly shows this line in 1900, other sources equally unambiguously date it to the summer of 1907. The branch was abandoned in 1944; no trace of it remains today. The Pennsy station has disappeared – even photographs of it are exceedingly rare – and the railbed cannot be discerned in aerial photographs of the area south of Oatka Creek.https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8≪=43.017788,-77.747803&spn;=0.003463,0.006545&t;=h&z;=18) See also *New Castle Branch *A short-line railway began operations in 2001 under the name Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad, running trains on former Erie Railroad and later former WNY&P; trackage.

Transitional crust welds continental crust to oceanic crust along the lines of continental break- up. Both VPM and NVPM form during rifting, when a continent rifts to form a new ocean basin. NVPM are different from VPM because of a lack of volcanism. Instead of intrusive magmatic structures, the transitional crust is composed of stretched continental crust and exhumed upper mantle. NVPM are typically submerged and buried beneath thick sediments, so they must be studied using geophysical techniques or drilling. NVPM have diagnostic seismic, gravity, and magnetic characteristics that can be used to distinguish them from VPM and for demarcating the transition between continental and oceanic crust.  Typical characteristics  500px NVPM are the result of rifting when a continent breaks up to form an ocean, producing transitional crust without volcanism. Extension causes a number of events to occur. First is lithospheric thinning, which allows asthenospheric upwelling; heating further erodes the lithosphere, furthering the thinning process. The extensional forces also cause listric faults and continentward dipping reflectors that help identify NVPM and distinguish them from VPM, characterized by seaward-dipping seismic reflectors. The main difference between NVPM and VPM is that in the latter case, the mantle is hot enough to melt and produce voluminous basalts, whereas in the former case the mantle doesn't melt and there is little or no volcanism. Instead, extension simply pulls the crust away, exposing or \\"unroofing\\" the mantle, exposing serpentinized peridotite. The mantle doesn't melt because it is cold or upwells slowly, so there are no igneous rocks like there are in VPM. The basalts and granites are replaced with serpentinized peridotite, accompanied by unique serpentothermal and hydrothermal activity. Increasing density of the lithosphere as it cools and sediment accumulation causes subsidence.  Geophysical properties  = Seismic characteristics = Seismic reflection lines across passive margins show many structural features common to both VPM and NVPM, such as faulting and crustal thinning, with the primary contra-indicator for volcanism being the presence of continent-ward dipping reflectors. NVPM also display distinct p-wave velocity structures that differentiate them from VPM. Typical NVPM exhibit a high velocity, high gradient lower crust (6.4-7.7 km/s) overlain by a thin, low velocity (4–5 km/s) upper crustal layer. The high velocity shallow layer is usually interpreted as the serpentinized peridotite associated with NVPM. In some cases, an extremely thick igneous underplating of a VPM will display similar P-wave velocity (7.2-7.8 km/s, but with a lower gradient). For this reason, velocity structure alone cannot be used to determine the nature of a margin. = Gravity properties = Gravity data provides information about the subsurface density distribution. The most important gravity feature associated with any continent-ocean transition, including NVPM, is the free-air edge effect anomaly, which consists of a gravity high and a gravity low associated with the contrast between the thick continental and thin oceanic crust. There are also subsurface variations in density that cause significant variations across the continent-ocean transition. The crust, as well as the entire lithosphere, is thinned due to mechanical extension. The Moho marks a large density contrast between crust and mantle, typically at least 0.35 g/cm3. The highest amplitudes of the gravity anomaly occur seaward of the continent-ocean transition. High-density upper mantle material is elevated relative to the more landward crustal root. The oceanic crust density is then further enhanced with gabbros and basalts and additionally contributes to the regional gravity trend. Where the thickness of the crust and lithosphere varies, equilibrium must be reached. Isostatic compensation and gravity anomalies result from balance between mass excess of the extra mantle beneath the thinned lithosphere and the overlying low-density crust. Positive gravity anomalies result from the relatively low flexural strength of the lithosphere during the beginning of rifting. As the passive margin matures, the crust and uppermost mantle become colder and stronger, so that the compensating deflection in the base of the lithosphere is broader than the actual rift. Higher flexural strength results in a broadening of the gravity anomaly with time. = Magnetic properties = The magnetic signature of a passive continental margin is influenced by the volume of material with a high magnetic susceptibility and the depth of the material below the surface. Large amplitude magnetic anomalies are associated with high magnetic susceptibility (~0.06 emu) igneous rocks of VPM. In contrast, NVPM exhibit only small amplitude anomalies associated with the edge effect at the boundary between the exhumed mantle (~0.003 emu) at the transition zone, and the true oceanic crust basalt (~0.05 emu). This anomaly can be used to locate the boundary between transitional crust and oceanic crust. The absence of large amplitude anomalies is a very strong indication that a margin is non-volcanic.  Formation  500px = Passive rifting = Passive rifting, unlike active rifting, occurs principally by extensional tectonic forces as opposed to magmatic forces originating from convection cells or mantle plumes. Isostatic forces allow mantle material to rise under the thinning lithosphere. Subsidence and sedimentation occur during both the initial rifting stage and the post rifting stages. Only after initial rifting does any mantle melting occur. Continued extension of the lithosphere will eventually lead to decompression melting of the mantle and the formation of a mid-ocean ridge. This process results in the creation of an ocean basin, and possibly conjugate NVPM. = Rifting models = There are several models for forming NVPM. Passive rifting can follow McKenzie's pure shear model, Wernicke's simple shear model, or a composite model combining features of both, as observed at the Galicia bank NVPM.  McKenzie pure shear model  Pure shear describes “homogeneous flattening” of rocks without rotations, while maintaining a constant volume. If a cube undergoes pure shearing, the result will be a rectangular prism with sides parallel to those of the initial cube. McKenzie's model predicts symmetric structures on either side of the rift zone composed of rotated fault blocks bounded by normal faults.  Wernicke simple shear model  In contrast to pure shear, simple shear describes constant volume strain with rotations. If a cube undergoes simple shearing, the result will be a parallelogram with sides that increase in length and are no longer parallel to the sides of the original cube. The top and bottom of the cube will neither stretch nor shorten. In a simple shear model, a basin is stretched asymmetrically by a large scale detachment fault extending from the upper crust to the lower lithosphere and even asthenosphere.  Galicia bank  = Composite model formation = 500px During the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, tectonic extensional forces created a shallow angle east-dipping detachment fault. This fault cut from what is now the Flemish Cap margin in Nova Scotia, eastern Canada to the Galicia margin, which is located west of the Iberian Peninsula. This fault penetrated the upper portion of the continental crust and merged into the transition between brittle upper and plastic lower crust. In time, displacement along this detachment fault decreased to zero at a point under the Galicia margin. East of this detachment fault, the structure of the Galicia NVPM is entirely pure shear resulting in rotated fault blocks, normal faults, and continent-ward dipping seismic reflectors. Simple shear is only evident in the western edge of the Galicia margin and the upper crust of the Flemish Cap margin where the crust is brittle. Below this brittle crust, the ductile crust follows McKenzie's pure shear model. Mantle material composed of peridotites is serpentinized by circulating seawater after it rises close enough to the upper crust due to its low density and isostatic forces. After sufficient thinning of the lithosphere, this serpentinized material is emplaced at the continent- ocean transition. This is why the transitional crust of NVPM are made of serpentinized peridotite instead of magmatic structures seen in VPM. Since the emplacement of the peridotite, oceanic crust has been forming at the Mid- Atlantic Ridge and driving the two NVPM apart. The simple shear detachment became a deactivated detachment fault once this rifting process began the formation of new oceanic crust. This process explains the structures seen at the Galicia margin today.

The others were School House Lane, Dysart Siding, Dysart Defence Sidings and Goulburn Junction. School House Lane School House Lane was the first terminus of the North East railway, opened as a temporary terminus as the girders for the Goulburn River bridge had not yet arrived from England. Located at 59 miles, 20 chains (95.4 kilometres) from Spencer Street it was open for public services between 18 April – 28 August 1872, and was provided with passenger and goods platforms, an engine shed, ash pit, water supply, and a derrick crane. A station building was provided, as well as a tent with brick chimney for the station master. After the line was extended into Seymour station, School House Lane was closed. Dysart Siding Dysart Siding was located on the Seymour side of the School House Lane level crossing, 94.9 kilometres from Spencer Street. Opened under the name 'School House Lane' for firewood traffic on 4 February 1889 it was renamed Dysart on 5 December 1904. The siding was on the eastern side of the main line, and connected to both the up and down lines, the connection to the down line being abolished in March 1889. Final closure came on 6 July 1943. Goulburn Junction The first Goulburn Junction signal box was at 95.4 kilometres from Spencer Street. Just south of the Goulburn River bridge, it was opened in October 1886 to control the points and signals at the end of the double line from Melbourne. The double line was not continued further north into Seymour due to the cost of duplicating the river bridge. In August 1925 the signal box was abolished when remote control was provided from Seymour 'A' signal box, and the junction itself was eliminated in May 1942 when the double line was extended over a new bridge into Seymour, to the west of the existing bridge. Goulburn Junction reappeared in 1961 when the parallel standard gauge line was opened, using the eastern bridge to cross the Goulburn River. As a result, the broad gauge was reduced to one track, the transition between double and single track being 96.1 kilometres from Spencer Street, and controlled from Seymour 'A' signal box. Dysart Defence Sidings 95.8 kilometres from Spencer Street, the Dysart Defence Sidings opened on 15 July 1941 to serve Puckapunyal and other army camps in the area. Located on the eastern side of the line, three sheds were located along a goods platform. A signal box was provided in 1942 to control the junction of the main line and the siding, but after the war saw little use. However they remained in operation until May 1987, when the sidings were closed and later removed.

The family Strobilopsidae has no subfamilies according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005).

Genera  Genera within the family Strobilopsidae include: * Coelostrobilops Pilsbry, 1931 * Discostrobilops Pilsbry, 1927 * Nesostrobilops Pilsbry, 1931 * Enteroplax Gude, 1899 * Eostrobilops Pilsbry, 1927 Minato H.

CiNii. * Strobilops Pilsbry, 1893 – type genus of the family Strobilopsidae  Shell description  The shell is trochiform, dome-shaped or discoidal and umbilicate. The shell has from 4½ to 6 slowly enlarging whorls. The aperture is small, oblique, with armature of 2 or 3 parietal lamellae and several deeply placed basal folds, all growing continuously from an early neanic stage. The peristome is more or less thickened and expanded, the ends of the lip remote, joined by a parietal callus. The shell, aside from its helicoid shape (not a character of great importance), differs from all Pupillidae in the arrangement of the lamellae and baso-palatal folds. In multidentate Pupillidae the five primary teeth are always recognizable while in Strobilops only the main parietal lamella and the columellar lamella can certainly be said to correspond, and these are found in so many other land shells that their occurrence is not especially significant. It is possible, however, that upper and lower palatal folds of Pupillidae are represented by teeth 5 (the most right basal tooth) and 2 (second left basal tooth), and the basal fold by tooth 1 (the most left basal tooth). By the accelerated lamellae and folds of the shell, which appear early in the neanic stage, Strobilops resembles various Tornatellininae (within Achatinellidae). In that family both parietal and palatal folds or laminae are sometimes present in the neanic stage. Various pupillid genera also, such as Orcula (Orculidae) and Lauria (Lauriidae), have apertural armature during the neanic stage. Orcula has spiral parietal and columellar lamellae but no basal or palatal folds. Lauria has basal folds, but they are spaced, transverse barriers, wholly unlike the adult basal or palatal armature of the species, and differing equally from the folds of immature Strobilops, which from their inception appear to develop continuously into those of the adult shell. It appears likely that the acceleration or early appearance of apertural armature in Tornatellininae, Orcula, Lauria and Strobilops has been independent in the four groups, and is not indicative of direct relationship between any of them.  Anatomy  The urethra lies very near the last part of the intestine. Digestive system: The jaw has numerous ribs. Radula with tricuspid central tooth with square basal plate, as large as the bicuspid laterals, the marginals multicuspid. Reproductive system: Ovotestis forms two groups of follicles. Penis is continued in a long epiphallus and bears a long appendix, with swollen basal and distal divisions, the penial retractor bifurcate, one branch inserted on the epiphallus, the other on the base of the appendix (distally it attaches to the right ocular retractor, according to G. Dallas Hanna). By the structure of the male organs Strobilops resembles Vallonia, Pupilla, Lauria, the Achatinellidae, and some other groups are similar in having a bifurcate penial retractor and a long, tripartite appendix. If G. Dallas Hanna is right in stating that the penial retractor is a branch of the right ocular band, this is an important difference from any known Orthurethra. The mouth parts do not differ materially from some Pupillidae.  Fossil distribution  Strobilopsidae appeared in the Upper Eocene of western Europe in several species having all the external characters of the genus Strobilops, and though the internal structure has not been worked out (in 1927), it is safe to assume that they are closely related to the well-known Oligocene forms following them. In Europe this genus continued in numerous species into the Pliocene, the last one in the Upper Pliocene (Astian stage) of Piedmont. In late Cretaceous beds there are various forms described as Helix, or under the names Obbinula and Pseudostrobilus, which certainly have some of the characters of Strobilops. All are larger than any Strobilops. References This article incorporates public domain text originating from the USA from the reference15px Pilsbry H. A. (1927).

Marriage =Mary Powell= Milton married Mary Powell in May 1642, and, shortly after, she left him and returned to live with her mother. He wanted to divorce her to marry another, but the legal statutes of England did not allow for Milton to apply for a divorce.Miller 1974 p. 3 Although it is impossible to know why exactly Powell separated from Milton, it is possible that Powell's family, a strong royalist family, caused a political difference that was exacerbated by the English Civil War. Regardless of her reason, the action motivated Milton towards researching and eventually writing on the topic. During his research, he read a work of Martin Bucer discussing divorce, which encouraged him to take up the arguments and pursue a reform of the English divorce laws.Patterson 2003 pp. 279–281 Milton began writing a series of divorce tracts. Sometime between 1642 and 1645, Milton met and attempted to pursue another woman known only as Miss Davis. During his involvement with her, he attempted to convince her that his marriage should have resulted in a divorce and that it would be appropriate for her to marry him although he was already legally married; this resulted in failure. However, this did not dissuade his campaign to reform the divorce laws, and he continued to pursue the topic until his wife returned to him.Miller 1974 pp. 3–4 This reconciliation could have come in part from the failure of the royalists, including Powell's family, to prevail during the English Civil War and the lack of justification to further distance themselves from Milton.Patterson 2003 p. 282 =Later wives= Milton and Powell's marriage lasted until 1652; Powell died while giving birth to Deborah, the couple's third daughter. Her death was followed by the death of John, their infant and only son. Milton married Katherine Woodcock in 1656. This marriage was far more successful than Milton's previous, but, like his first wife, Woodcock died from complications experienced while giving birth. By this time, Milton had fully succumbed to blindness and had to raise his three daughters. This put significant strain on Milton, and matters were only complicated further when Oliver Cromwell died in 1658 and the Commonwealth fell apart.Rumrich 2003 p. 154 Milton was married for a third time on 24 February 1662, this time to Elizabeth Mynshull (1638-1728). There was a 31-year age-gap between them, but in spite of this Milton's marriage to her seems to have been incredibly happy. Indeed, Elizabeth was described as Milton's \\"Third and best wife,\\" though some argued that she cheated his children and heirs out of their money upon his death. After Milton's death, Mynshull never remarried. reference needed Friendship =Charles Diodati= Until his marriage, Milton was involved in only one close relationship: his friendship with Charles Diodati (1608?–1638). They were schoolboys together at St Paul's School and kept up a correspondence.Rumrich 2003 p. 145 This exchange prompted Milton's Elegy 1. Diodati was the nephew of Giovanni Diodati, a member of a prominent Italian Calvinist family originally from Lucca. Diodati's father Theodore was a court and fashionable Swiss-Italian physician in England, with a practice in London; he himself became a physician after studying at Oxford, in Chester and then in London. When Diodati died, Milton composed an elegy entitled Epitaphium Damonis in his friend's memory, and included a headnote saying that they \\"had pursued the same studies\\" and that they were the \\"most intimate friends from childhood on\\".qtd in Lewalski 2003 p. 9 =Andrew Marvell= On 21 February 1653, Milton recommended Andrew Marvell for a position with the Commonwealth's Council of State as his assistant after his previous assistant died. It is uncertain when the two first met, but Marvell knew Milton's works and included similar themes within his own poetry a few years prior. Milton liked Marvell, and in his recommendation describes Marvell asLewalski 2003 pp. 292–293 > Milton 1962 p. 859–860 The Council did not accept Marvell, and they instead made Philip Meadowes, a diplomat, assistant to Milton.Lewalski 2003 p. 293 By September 1657, Marvell was finally allowed to be Milton's assistant, and the two become close. During this time, John Dryden was employed in the same office and, according to Barbara Lewalski, it was \\"A remarkable happenstance, that the three best poets of the age should be together at the same time in Cromwell's bureaucracy!\\"Lewalski 2003 p. 344 =Nathan Paget= Paget was a physician, on friendly terms with Milton from around 1651, and a cousin of his third wife Elizabeth. Literary =Thomas Hobbes= There is little known about a direct relationship, if there was any, between Milton and Thomas Hobbes except for one passage from John Aubrey's Minutes of the Life of Mr. John Milton: \\"His widow assures me that Mr. T. Hobbes was not one of his acquaintances, that her husband did not like him at all, but he would acknowledge him to be a man of great parts, and a learned man. There interests and tenets did run counter to each other\\".qtd in Kerrigan 2007 p. xxx This does not stop scholars from wanting to compare these two contemporaries together, especially with their conflicting ideas on politics. To Marjorie Nicolson, Milton spent his life combating and counteracting the philosophy of Hobbes, an individual that he believed was \\"The Atheist and Arch Heretic\\".Nicolson 1926 pp. 405–433 However, this view was challenged a decade later by George Williamson, who believed that, in terms of philosophy and not theology or politics, Milton and Hobbes held similar beliefs.Williamson 1935 pp. 553–579 These views became two extremes of a debate on the relationship between the two, and Nathaniel Henry, to try to find a compromise between both sides, argued that both were wrong because \\"Hobbes was no atheist\\"Henry 1951 p. 241 and that \\"Milton and Hobbes were in reality somewhat opposed in their views\\".Henry 1951 p. 249 Henry argued that the only way to determine an intellectual relationship between the two men was to analyse how their philosophical views, and, particularly, \\"Milton's views on the soul must be considered from a wider point of view\\". The view that Milton held of the soul was the Anabaptist idea of soul sleeping. Hobbes, according to Henry, was a follower of John Calvin's Psychopannychia, which \\"was a tract against the 'Anabaptist' doctrine of the sleep of the soul between death and resurrection, separating the two further.Henry 1951 p. 232 The two were also opposed in their views on how best to prevent Catholicism to enter into England. Milton believed that the only way to stop Catholicism was to remove all centralised government and liturgical practices and, according to Timothy Rosendale, \\"he flatly denounces the liturgy as 'evil'\\" and as a \\"popish relic\\".Rosendale 2004 p. 152 Hobbes argued that this decentralisation could not have this effect because, as Patricia Springborg points out, the \\"national religions of the Reformed Church still retained theological doctrines which could give Roman Catholicism a foot-hold in the realm\\".Springborg 1994 p. 555 Notes References * Garrison, John. “Plurality and Amicitia in Milton’s Epitaphium Damonis,” Milton Quarterly 46.3 (October 2012): 154-173. * Henry, Nathaniel. \\"Milton and Hobbes: Mortalism and the Intermediate State,\\" SP, Vol. 48 (1951): 234–249. * Kerrigan, William; Rumrich, John; and Fallon, Stephen (eds.)

As a player, he played as a centre midfielder for several English clubs, including Manchester United, Charlton Athletic and Bristol Rovers, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before moving to Scandinavia, playing for various clubs in Finland and Sweden. Wilson is now employed as an International Scout by Chelsea Football Club concentrating on the Scandinavian countries. Career Born in Burnley, Lancashire, Wilson joined Manchester United on associate schoolboy terms in January 1984. He made 12 appearances for the club's Junior B team in the Lancashire League Second Division in 1984–85 season, and signed apprentice forms in May 1985. The following season, he divided his time between the club's Junior A, Junior B and Youth teams, as well as making an appearance for the Reserve team in March 1986. In March 1987, Wilson signed a professional contract with Manchester United and, by the 1987–88 season, he had become a regular in the Reserve team. The 1988–89 season saw Wilson finally progress to the first team, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute for Clayton Blackmore in a 1–1 home draw with Sheffield Wednesday on 23 November 1988. He made his FA Cup debut later that season, playing in the Third Round tie against Queens Park Rangers on 7 January 1989; the match finished goalless, forcing a replay four days later, which Wilson also played in. Unfortunately for Wilson, his sixth appearance for the club – all of which came as a substitute – would also be his last first team outing. After that 2–0 home defeat to Derby County, Wilson returned to playing in the club's Reserve team, and was sent on a month-long loan to Lincoln City in October 1990. In March 1991, he went on loan again, this time to Charlton Athletic, where he played until the end of the season. His Manchester United contract expired at the end of June 1991, and he was allowed to join Bristol Rovers on a free transfer on 30 June 1991. Wilson played for Bristol Rovers for two seasons, but only managed 11 appearances for the Somerset club before moving to Finland to play for RoPS (Rovaniemen Palloseura) for the second half of the 1993 Veikkausliiga season. He was then picked up by Ljungskile of Sweden for the 1994 season, and played for them until the end of 1998. Between 1999 and 2001, Wilson played for Haka of Finland where he twice picked up a league winners medal, but he was then signed by HJK Helsinki for the 2002 season, winning a further league title. In 2003, Wilson returned to Sweden and to Ljungskile, this time as a player- manager. He remained in the role for two seasons, before spending a third purely as a manager. In that third season, he guided the team to promotion to the Superettan via a play-off win against Vasby United and a fourth-place finish in 2005 during their first season back in the Superettan, before winding down his playing career with Rosseröd. The following season, Wilson went into management on a full-time basis, taking the reins at GIF Sundsvall. After a season in Sundsvall, Wilson returned to Ljungskile for a third time, and guided them to promotion to the Allsvenskan in his second season back at the club. In the 2008 season, however, Ljungskile could only finish in 14th place in the league and had to play in a relegation play-off against the third-placed team from the Superettan, Brommapojkarna. Ljungskile managed a 0–0 draw away from home, but a 1–1 draw at the H. A. Bygg Arena meant that Brommapojkarna were promoted to the Allsvenskan on away goals, at Ljungskile's expense.  Coaching career  Wilson's first foray into management came in 2003, when he was made player-manager of Ljungskile.

He served with the 8th Air Force in England, before being assigned to the 483rd Bombardment Group, based in Foggia, Italy. In March 1945, Broyill was the tailgunner on a B-17 Flying Fortress known as the \\"Big Yank.\\" The nose-art on the \\"Big Yank\\" included a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was painted by Italian artist Mario Rucci. On March 24, 1945, Broyhill and the \\"Big Yank\\" flew in a 28-plane formation targeting the Daimler-Benz tank works near Berlin. The mission was the longest escorted bomber mission of World War II in Europe. The American bomber group was confronted by Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters. In the air battle that followed, The 483rd Bombardment Group set several records, including the following: * Most German jets destroyed by a single bomb group on one mission: six. * Most German jets destroyed by one bomb group for the entire war: seven. * Most German jets destroyed by a single crew on one mission: three. * Most German jets destroyed by a single crew for the entire war: three. * Most German jets destroyed by a single bomber for entire war: three.

Although they are only fictional technologies, they form the basics of the Real Robot genre of anime and are influencing real life academic research The Times, 1 November 2008 and different anime series.  History  Universal Century technology debuted in Gundam Century, written by editors, academy and studios hired by OUT magazine at that time,Gundam Century Renewal Version Afterword later part of the book was endorsed by Sunrise and Bandai, and some of the authors of the articles within Gundam Century became official editors and writers of Gundam mechanics.Gundam Officials Acknowledgement A main part of the book surrounds the discussion on real-life technologies including space habitats and mass driver. Later, following the trend of militaristic and technological interest in the community, Gundam Sentinel Special Edition included a section called imidam 0093 (Innovative Mobile Suit Information Dictionary, Annual Series, intentionally using an m at the end to reference Gundam), subtitled \\"Basic Knowledge of Gundam Mechanics\\". Written by mechanical designer Katoki Hajime, summarized both in- and out-of-universe technologies of the Universal Century, sourcing from Gundam Century, Gun Sight, VF-1 Valkyrie, MS Graphical Guide 1~3, MSV Technical & History 1~3.Gundam Sentinel Special Edition Gundam Officials has collected this information and has presented it along with plot history and character summaries in an encyclopedic form, and MS Encyclopedia 2003 has a short technical summary of these technologies in its first section before going into the lists of mobile weapons in different series, which earlier editions only have.MS Encyclopedia 2003  Cultural significance  Although fictional technologies seems to carry no real-life significance, these technologies are referred to in almost all of the series of Universal Century. They became a normal reference of the serial story and attracted publishers to publish books on them. These technological settings have also since influenced a lot of anime and manga to have their own technological background to a certain degree.Gundam Officials afterword Although it could be viewed as following the Star Wars trend, nothing similar has started before the 1981 publishing of Gundam Century.Gundam Century renewal version acknowledgment Bandai (with its branch Sunrise) noticed the tradition and has hired writers to write articles for other Gundam series too.G20 In the Cosmic Era time line, one of the authors of Gundam Century articles (while still a high school student at that time), Shigeru Morita, who had become a regular employee of Bandai, was assigned to write these kinds of technological articles, possibly a method used by the company to attract Universal Century techno fans to watch the new series.From the G Field, Newtype magazine special edition The series' technology is now serving as the inspiration for academic research in different fields, which could include moon settlements and mega- particle cannon. The latest robot technology in Japan is also influenced by Gundam, due to its fictional technologies' being highly adapted from real- world science,巨大ロボット誕生―最新ロボット工学がガンダムを生む (Birth of Giant Robot - Latest Robotics Engineering birth from Gundam), , Shuwa system co., Ltd. and the Universal Century technologies including space colonies and mobile suits are also viewed academically as to what they can do in real life.宇宙世紀科学読本―スペース・コロニーとガンダムのできるまで (Universal Century Science digest - From Space colonies to what Gundam can do), , Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co., Ltd. During the Tokyo International Film Festival 2015, Director Tomino first saw Minovsky Particles as a dramatic device, \\"Because destroying enemies on the other side of Earth with missiles would not be dramatic, to make people meet and fight in space, ranged weapons have to be rendered useless.\\" and claimed that he did not think of Engineering and Electronics at all. While researcher(Associate Professor in University of Tsukuba) and media artist Yoichi Ochiai viewed this in the science angle and said that even currently, if computers are not working right, things will get really weak, mixing in analogue in the machine is a correct choice and the setting is excellent. Ochiai also mentioned the idea in his book \\"The Age of Magic\\" saying \\"The people using computers has a greater power of understanding\\", and admitted that this view is influenced by Newtype in Gundam.http://www.gundam.info/topic/14158 Space colony The space colony (precisely space habitat) technology in Universal Century is referenced from the real world projects proposed by Gerard K. O'Neill in his book The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space. In the Universal Century (U.C.) timeline, space colonies are placed at the five Earth-Moon Lagrangian points. In most cases, a Lagrangian point is home to more than one group of space colonies. Individual colony pairs are known as Bunches, and a group of colonies that occupy a Lagrangian point are known collectively as a Side. Because Sides sometimes share a single Lagrangian point, it is possible to have two Sides in close orbit to one another. Most colonies in the Universal Century are O'Neill \\"Island 3\\" type colony cylinders, yet a few early built Bernal sphere (Island 1) and Stanford torus colonies are still in function, but most are changed to space stations or discarded.The Day when Science will overtake Science Fiction, , Eagle Publishing Side 3's colonies are identical in size and shape to the Island 3 design, but doubled the habitable area by removing the large window strips of the Island 3.Gundam Science, Gundam Century Renewal Version, ISBN / 4-87777-028-3, Kisousha, 15th Mar, 2000.Robot & Rockets & Futuropolis, Gundam SF World, Shonen Magazine DeluxeThe Mobile Suit Epoch Vol. 1, Cities in the sky, Kofu Culture Imagine Publish, Inc., (Chinese)  Mobile suit technology  These technologies are the basic reasoning for the Universal Century's having mobile suits as the main battle units, replacing space fighters. This has influenced later series to include their own reasoning to rationalize the existence of humanoid fighting vehicles. = AMBAC = One of the most famous rationale being used is the Active Mass Balance Auto-Control (AMBAC) system, referenced also in various other series including Macross.Hobby Japan Feb, 2005 issue, Ball special Within the non-UC Gundam series, the AMBAC system term is also used in Mobile Suit Gundam 00.Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Special report, Gundam Kyrios section The AMBAC system is a fundamental technology that allows for thrusterless manoeuvring in the zero-G environment of space by mobile suits by means of precise movement control of their limbs in the Gundam universe.Gundam CenturyGundam Officials AMBAC works by leveraging Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion (when there's an action there is an equal and opposite reaction) with regard to inertia to effect changes in direction. Mobile suits performing AMBAC motions would presumably move similarly to present-day astronauts performing extra-vehicular activity: both typically having roughly similar body structure, their use of that mass to control their rotation would presumably be similar, even if calculated by different means. AMBAC is by its nature limited to re-orienting the unit about its center of mass, and is not a substitute for propulsion. It is often used in conjunction with the propulsion system to quickly turn the unit and shorten aiming speed as well as directing the main thrusters. The system is similar in principle to the momentum wheel system used in present-day satellites, though obviously more complex and allows the centre of mass move outside of the unit.Gundam Sentinel special edition Gundam Wars III, ASIN: 4499205301, 大日本絵画 (Dai Nippon Kaiga Co. Ltd.), Sept, 1989. (May, 2006, 11th edition)  Tail Binder and Wing Binder  Binders are technological instruments that provide extra control for the AMBAC systems. The idea is simple: \\"If four limbs can manoeuvre the unit better than none, why not equip them with 5 or more?\\" The resulting advancement is the tail binder. A cousin to the tail binder is the wing binder, equipped on most transformable mobile suits with waverider mode as wings. The system made use of the wings' mobility for the transformation during mobile suit mode as AMBAC limbs and further increasing the number of limbs for the AMBAC system. The tail binder is also seen on later models of military aircraft and space fighters in U.C.0088, on the FF-08 Wyvern.  Minovsky physics  The Minovsky physics is the fundamental technological advancement in the Universal Century series, as all Beam weaponry (including the lightsaber-like Beam Sabers), nuclear technology and defensive measures are based upon this fictional physics. According to the Gundam Century, MS encyclopedia 2003 and Gundam Officials, the Minovsky Physics all started from the invention of the then seemingly impossible idea of a nuclear fusion reactor that has a higher theoretical efficiency than classical physics, due to the Minovsky particle. The Minovsky-Ionesco reactor was named after its fictional inventors, Dr. Y.T. Minovsky and Dr. Ionesco. This reactor was \\"radical\\" because it was the first \\"clean\\" nuclear reactor, emitting zero neutron radiation. The nuclear equation was: : {}^3_2\\\\mathrm{He} + {}^2_1\\\\mathrm H \\\\to {}^4_2\\\\mathrm{He} + \\\\mathrm p (energy released: 18.35 MeV) This is essentially the same equation as used in classical physics, with the addition of the fictional Minovsky particle as a catalyst, instead of a muon. = Minovsky particle = According to the official guide of Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam Century and Gundam Officials, the Minovsky Physics Society, while working on the reactor, encountered a strange electromagnetic wave effect in U.C.0065 within the Minovsky-Ionesco reactor that could not be explained by conventional physics. Within the next few years, they identified the cause: a new elementary particle generated by the helium-3 reaction on the inner wall of the reactor, which was named the or \\"M\\" particle. The Minovsky particle has near-zero rest mass - though, like any particle, its mass increases to reflect its potential or kinetic energy - and can carry either a positive or negative electrical charge. When scattered in open space or in the air, the repulsive forces between charged Minovsky particles cause them to spontaneously align into a regular cubic lattice structure called an I-field. An I-field lattice will slowly expand and scatter into space; however, after dense interference it will take approximately 29 days before the region can support normal electromagnetic communication again. The main use of the Minovsky particle was in combat and communication. When the Minovsky particle is spread in large numbers in the open air or in open space, the particles disrupt low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves and radio waves. The Minovsky particle also interferes with the operations of electronic circuitry and destroys unprotected circuits due to the particles' high electrical charge which act like a continuous electromagnetic pulse on metal objects. Because of the way Minovsky particles react with other types of radiation, radar systems and long-range wireless communication systems become useless, infra-red signals are defracted and their accuracy decreases, and visible light is fogged. This became known as the \\"Minovsky Effect\\". The disruption of electromagnetic radiation is due to the small lattice of the I-field creating fringes that long wavelengths cannot penetrate, and that diffract wavelengths that have similar distance with the fringes. This diffraction and polarization process disrupts the electromagnetic waves.科学．謎？なぜ？読本, Science, Mystery? Why? Digest, 宝島社, Takarajima sha, , P166, What is the Minovsky Particle in Gundam? The only counter measure to the \\"M\\" particle in the series was to install bulky and expensive shielding on all electronic equipment, but only to counteract the effect it had on electronic circuitry. While this could be done for space ships and naval ships, this ruled out the use of precision guided weapons, such as guided missiles. Due to this, the military use of Minovsky particles ushered in a new era of close- range combat. This is the primary reason for the birth of the Zeon close- combat weapon: the mobile suit.Gundam and World War II, Doitsu Suzuki, Kosaido Shuppan, = Minovsky ultracompact fusion reactor = According to the timeline deduced by the Gundam Officials, in UC 0071, Zeon researchers created the Minovsky ultracompact fusion reactor. Instead of the conventional magnetic field, this improved version of the Minovsky-Ionesco reactor used an I-field to confine and compress the reactor fuel, triggering a fusion reaction. The Minovsky particles produced as a byproduct of the helium-3 fusion reaction were recycled to keep that reaction going. The Minovsky particles that form the I-field lattice also helped catalyze the fusion reaction, in a process similar to the muon-catalyzed fusion investigated by real-world scientists during the 1950s. This super-efficient design was only a fifth as large as an equivalently powerful Minovsky-Ionesco reactor; for this reason, it was adopted for use on mobile suits as the standard power plant.The Mobile Suit Epoch Vol. 2, Sun in a box, Kofu Culture Imagine Publish, Inc., (Chinese) = Mega-particle cannon = The fictional weapons of the Universal Century were described to be utilizing the degeneracy of the Minovsky Particle by compressing Minovsky particles in high pressure chambers and firing out the degenerated Minovsky particles (from the fusing of a positively charged and a negatively charged one) which carries high energy and mass from the degeneration of the matter. Smaller versions of the mega particle cannon are presented in the series, the most famous being the Beam rifle used by the titular mobile suit RX-78 Gundam, which utilizes a technology called E-cap. The mobile suit does not need to spend much energy to compress the Minovsky particles; instead, most of the compression was done by the mother-ship and the mobile suit only needed to provide minimum energy for triggering the final degeneration energy.ガンダム「武器．防具」伝, Gundam \\"Weapons, Defensive measures\\" biography, PHP publication E-cap technology appears outside of UC continuity in MS Saga: A New Dawn.  Beam smart gun  According to Gundam Sentinel Special Edition, the beam smart gun is designed to bend the output beam by up to 20 degrees. In the original Mobile Suit Gundam series, Char Aznable commented that the way to avoid a beam rifle is to avoid its being pointed at you. As such, a gun that does not need to be pointed directly at the target is more dangerous. = Funnels = Funnels are essentially funnel-shaped drone units that are designed to be remotely controlled by a Newtype pilot. They are equipped with a small beam cannon and an energy cell to propel the funnel when it is operating. A Newtype pilot is able to control these funnels with great precision via a psycommu system, allowing the user to conduct BVR attacks on a target from almost all directions without having to establish visual contact, making a funnel-equipped mobile suit extremely deadly. When the funnels are not in use, they are attached to the mother suit's surface hardpoints for recharging. All Zeon funnel-equipped units have the ability to recharge funnels, but the Earth Federation Forces were very slow in adopting the technology. Later variants include Funnel missiles that are guided missiles using funnel-like remote control designs employed in the story Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway's Flash.  Cultural influence  The new DACS (Divert & Attitude Control System) created by the Japan Self-Defense Forces in December, 2006 was quoted as an attempt to create a funnel system in real life by Gizmodo Japan.Gizmodo Japan  Newtypes and related technologies  The word first came into being when Zeon Zum Deikun, the fictional character, founder of the space colony-based Principality of Zeon, created his philosophy: mankind was destined to leave the Earth for space, where they would experience a cognitive shift, and evolve into a kind of übermensch called the Newtype. As Newtypes began to grow in number during and following the One Year War, the psycommu (psychic communicator) system was invented, which allowed these Newtypes to control wireless weapons known as bits and funnels, and even mobile suits, through thought alone. The device detects and amplifies the user's brainwaves, and a sophisticated computer system enables the user to manipulate weapons by using his/her mind. The Psycoframe is a later technology that builds the psycommu into the nanomachines within the metal frame of a mobile suit. This allows a Newtype pilot to control the mobile suit as if it were his/her own body. A Psychoframe can project a Psychofield, which can happen when two Psychoframes are near, this Psychofield is a space where the human consciousness can manipulate the world regardless of the laws of psychics. Other Newtype technologies are the Bio-Sensor system, the Quasi- psycommu system, the Neo-psycommu system, the Bio-computer, the EXAM System, the Angel Halo fortress, and the NT-D system. Conventional weapons Despite being set in the distant future, the Universal Century has several takes on modern weapons such as the twin gunned Type 61 main battle tank that bears a striking resemblance to the Israeli Merkava, the \\"Calt\\" M-72A1 assault rifle that is near identical to the British L-85, anti mobile suit weapons reminiscent of the BGM-71 TOW and Kornet, and even light utility vehicles similar to World War II era Jeeps.

The site, which offers consumers a line of revolving credit through Synchrony Bank, allows purchases to be made online without using a credit card. The company was one of the first recipients of the Red Herring Global 100 Award by the publication Red Herring. On November 7, 2008, PayPal completed its acquisition of Bill Me Later. It was formerly owned by I4 Commerce. How it works After customers open their accounts (including credit check), PayPal Credit asks customers at every purchase to log into their PayPal account to complete the transaction. The approved customer can then pay the bill by mail (check), phone or online (via bank account) at www.PayPal.com. Once the PayPal Credit account is linked to PayPal, it becomes a funding option within the PayPal account and gives the option to pay off the PayPal Credit balance. Customers also get an email whenever they are declined. In cases when they are declined and they don't receive declined email/letter, they can contact PayPal Credit Customer Service to check if it was not a system issue. PayPal Credit is not a credit card but a revolving line of credit offered by Synchrony Bank. Much like a traditional credit card, the company will charge late payments if necessary. Terms For purchases of $99 and over that are made through PayPal wallet, customers have 6 months to pay their bill in full. If they don't, then they are charged interest at a 19.99% APR starting from the original purchase date. Purchases not made through the PayPal wallet will only receive promotional financing if the merchant is offering it. Developers/new merchant integration Unlike its parent company PayPal which is available to most e-commerce entities, Bill Me Later isn't available to most businesses. New merchants can request integration through a website operated by the company.  Other products  Besides its flagship consumer service, Bill Me Later also offers Bill Me Later Business (As of May 13, 2012 Bill Me Later Business has been discontinued) (seen at USPS) and Preferred Account (seen at Newegg). In Bill Me Later Business, the users are business owners who want to use the equivalent of a corporate card for buying products and services over the web. The business owner would apply for Bill Me Later Business - using data like EIN etc. The Preferred Account is similar to the concept of a charge card - that can be used at a particular merchant only. As of July 2018, there is no available list of online retailers where PayPal credit is accepted. Moreover, PayPal credit is not available as a payment method on all websites where PayPal is accepted.  Bill Me Later in PayPal wallet  After the PayPal acquisition of Bill Me Later, Bill Me Later is offered as a payment method through PayPal at sites that both accept PayPal and Bill Me Later. PayPal balances are accepted as payment on Bill Me Later statements.  Lawsuits  On May 19, 2015 CFPB filed a complaint and proposed consent order in federal court against PayPal, Inc. for illegally signing up consumers for its online credit product, however, a judge has to approve if there was any law infringement before moving the case to court.

Analysis of DNA sequences has shown that Smeagol belongs in the family Ellobiidae, and is therefore closely related to ellobiid snails.  Etymology  The name of the genus is in honour of Tolkien's fictional character Gollum, who was originally known as Sméagol.  Species  There are five described species and potentially one undescribed species from Tasmania in the genus Smeagol: * Smeagol climoi Tillier & Ponder, 1992 * Smeagol hilaris Tillier & Ponder, 1992 * Smeagol manneringi Climo, 1980 * Smeagol parvulus Tillier & Ponder, 1992 * Smeagol phillipensis Tillier & Ponder, 1992  Anatomy  Smeagol manneringi has no tentacles and is a very active blind animal with a size of up to 10 mm. Smeagol species have no shell. They have a weakly developed snout. The radula is unicuspid and the radular dentition is of the rhipidoglossate type. They have a radular membrane of flexoglossate type. They have no jaw. They have salivary glands with salivary ducts. The excretory organs are only the left ones, in the pallial cavity. In the circulatory system the haemolymph circulates as follows: mantle → nephridium or nephridia → heart. These slugs breathe using a pallial lung. They have a contractile pneumostome.Barker G. M.

He is a two-time Swedish Chess Champion. First moves and playing style As a youngster, he made solid progress and was consequently selected to represent his country in the various age categories of the European Youth and World Youth Championships. Surprisingly, he did not manage to secure a medal, but came very close in 1996, at Rimavská Sobota, finishing the European Under-16 contest with a share of 2nd-5th places and missing the silver and bronze medals only on tie-break. As Berg received his chess education in the shadow of national legend Ulf Andersson, it might be expected that his playing style would mirror that of Sweden's most successful player of the modern era. However, the styles of the players are almost polar opposites, the younger man showing a distinct preference for aggressive, dynamic chess. Tournament record He spent several years making slow, but sure progress. He earned his GM title in 2004, following a number of tournament successes, including wins at Budapest 1999, Skellefteå 2001 (shared with Jonny Hector) and Bermuda 2002 (after a play-off). Since 1998, he has regularly entered the national championship, finishing runner-up on no fewer than five occasions (2001, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008) and winning the event in 2009 and 2010. His consistent, strong performances have helped his Elo rating to edge past 2600. There have been other notable results in international competition; he was joint winner of Stockholm's Rilton Cup in 2004/5 (with Sergei Volkov and Evgeny Gleizerov), won outright at Sóller in 2006 and was fourth behind Ivanchuk, Karpov and Kasimdzhanov at the Keres Memorial the same year. In 2007, he came third at Wijk aan Zee's Corus 'C' event (after Michał Krasenkow and Ian Nepomniachtchi), having featured in a five-way tie for first place at the Politiken Cup (with Krasenkow, Sargissian, de Firmian and Malakhov). At the 'Politiken' event of 2008, he finished just a half point behind the leaders. Elsewhere in 2008, he scored 7/10 to finish 10th= at the Gibtelecom Masters in Gibraltar and the same score brought him a creditable share of fifth place at the EU Championship in Liverpool. At the Najdorf Memorial in Warsaw, he placed joint second with Tomi Nyback, after Krishnan Sasikiran. In 2012, he shared first place with Slavko Cicak and Hans Tikkanen at the Västerås Open. Team events Berg is regularly selected to represent his country at major team events and following a significant upswing in his rating, nowadays plays on board one. He has participated in all of the Olympiads between 2002–2008 and the European Team Chess Championships of 1999, 2003 and 2007. At the Dresden 2008 Olympiad, he had a disastrous result, winning no games at all, for a lowly score of 1½ points from 9 games. In stark contrast, his team-mates did exceedingly well, keeping Sweden in contention round after round, and thereby ensuring that Berg had to endure a barrage of top-class opponents, including two ex-world champions. Berg is a close friend of Sweden's latest grandmaster and Olympiad team-mate, Pontus Carlsson. They played league chess together for the successful Sollentuna SK club. In 2009 he joined Burgsvik SK, currently playing in the third division in Sweden.

Its scientific name means \\"wonder-fish\\" in Greek; oceanographer Anton Bruun described these fishes as \\"altogether one of the oddest creatures in the teeming variety of the fish world.\\" In contrast to other anglerfishes, the bioluminescent lure (called the \\"esca\\") of Thaumatichthys is located inside its cavernous mouth. They are worldwide in distribution and are ambush predators living near the ocean floor. Taxonomy The first specimen of Thaumatichthys was collected by an American expedition in Indonesia in 1908 and given the species name pagidostomus (\\"trap-mouthed\\"). A subsequent specimen from the north Atlantic was placed by Regan and Trewavas (1932) into a new genus, Amacrodon, based on differences in dentition. Bruun assigned a specimen collected by the Galathea Expedition of 1950-52 to a third genus, Galatheathauma (\\"Galathea's wonder\\"), as it was much larger than the previous specimens. However, a later examination of the then-32 known specimens showed that these differences were attributable to age, and thus there was only one valid genus, Thaumatichthys, with three species. The closest relative of Thaumatichthys is Lasiognathus, which also possesses enlarged, hinged premaxillaries, denticles on the esca, and a branched upper operculum. There are also significant differences between the two genera though, and Lasiognathus shares many more traits with the family Oneirodidae (in which it was formerly placed) than does Thaumatichthys.Pietsch, T.W. (2005). Thaumatichthyidae. Wolftrap Seadevils. The Tree of Life Web Project. Retrieved on December 7, 2008. Species There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Thaumatichthys axeli Bruun, 1953 * Thaumatichthys binghami A. E. Parr, 1927 * Thaumatichthys pagidostomus H. M. Smith & Radcliffe, 1912 Distribution and habitat Thaumatichthys is known from tropical oceanic waters worldwide. T. pagidostoma, the first species to be discovered, is only known from a single specimen caught at a depth of 1,440 m in the Gulf of Tomini off Sulawesi. T. axeli occurs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, while T. binghami is found in and around the Caribbean Sea. Larvae that could not be referred to species have also been found off the Gulf of Guinea in the southern Atlantic Ocean and in the southern Mozambique Channel in the eastern Indian Ocean. Uniquely amongst deep-sea anglerfish, adult Thaumatichthys are benthic in nature; T. binghami and T. pagidostomus are found on the continental shelf between 1,000-2,000 m, while T. axeli is found in the abyssal zone at about 3,600 m. Description Dorsal and ventral view of T. pagidostomus. As with most other deep-sea anglerfishes, Thaumatichthys shows extreme sexual dimorphism with the females much larger and different in morphology from the males. Female Thaumatichthys are characterized by a long, broad, flattened head with enlarged premaxillaries on the upper jaw that overhang the relatively short lower jaw. The premaxillaries are hinged with the skull in such a way that they can be moved down to enclose the lower jaw in a manner similar that of a Venus flytrap. The outer margin of the premaxillaries bear six rows of long, conical, recurved teeth; the teeth in the lower jaw are much shorter. The number and length of the teeth increases as the fish grows. The distinctive lure of Thaumatichthys is achieved by an \\"upside-down\\" orientation of the illicium (the \\"fishing rod\\"): its base is embedded in the skin fold connecting the anterior ends of the premaxillaries, and the short illicium projects down and back so that the esca at the tip hangs down from the roof of the mouth. The escal bulb terminates in a pair of forked tendrils and bears varying numbers of lateral lobes and a single curved denticle. The size of the transparent window in the bulb can be adjusted to change the amount of light emanating from the lure. The eyes are tiny and placed close to the corners of the mouth. There are numerous black papillae with white tips, resembling those of the lateral line (and likely belonging to the same sensory system), inside the mouth. The body is fairly slender and depressed for a deep-sea anglerfish, with a relatively well developed dorsal fin. The fin rays number 4 in the anal fin, 7 in the caudal fin, 6-7 in the dorsal fin, and 14-16 in the pectoral fins. The upper part of the operculum is divided into 5-13 radiating branches. The skin is velvet black or dark brown, with numerous small spines on the lower part of the head and body. The one specimen of T. pagidostomus measured 6 cm long, the largest known specimen of T. binghami measured 29 cm long, and the largest specimen of T. axeli measured 36.5 cm long. The males are small and slender, with greatly enlarged olfactory organs, long hooked denticles at the tips of the jaws, and no esca. The skin is a uniform dark brown with small spines throughout. As the male matures, the body and head become less deep and the jaws become more prolongated. The largest known male specimen measured 45 mm long. Biology and ecology The unusual jaw mechanism and esca of Thaumatichthys has been described as a \\"living mouse-trap with bait\\". The premaxillaries on either side of the upper jaw are able to rotate nearly 180° down to trap prey attracted by the luminescent lure; this closing action is effected by large, extremely well developed upper jaw muscles. Muscles in the illicium allow the esca to be swung forward and backward, so as to better entice prey inside the mouth. The upper jaw mechanism enables prey to be captured without the lower jaw, which can remain moving for the purposes of respiration. Despite this highly specialized predatory apparatus however, examination of stomach contents revealed sea cucumbers as well as plant matter, suggesting that these fishes are omnivores that will swallow anything edible. It is unknown whether male Thaumatichthys are parasitic. The structure of the jaws in mature males suggests that feeding is impaired after metamorphosis. The larvae are epipelagic like those of other deep-sea anglerfishes, and are found at depths of no more than 100 m. As the larvae grow and approach metamorphosis, they descend deeper until they reach the bottom. The larvae can be identified by their divided operculum and a subdermal pigment layer that covers the entire head and body. The species differ as follows: *Thaumatichthys axeli Both this species and T. binghami have relatively shorter premaxillaries, at 23.5-27% of standard length. The esca of this species has a single pair of lateral lobes that are enlarged into tapering filaments in the largest individuals, and the uppermost median appendage on its esca is wart-like and not tapering. *Thaumatichthys binghami This species is similar to T. axeli, except that its esca bears 2-3 pairs of lateral lobes that are elongated into tapering filaments in the largest individuals, and the uppermost medial appendage on the esca is finger-like and tapering. *Thaumatichthys pagidostomus This species has relatively longer premaxillaries than the other species (measuring 33% of standard length), and the anterior premaxillary teeth are long.

Although this is more hazardous for personnel than working on electrical equipment with the power off, live-line maintenance techniques are used in the electric power distribution industry to avoid the disruption and high economic costs of having to turn off power to customers to perform essential periodic maintenance on transmission lines and other equipment. The first techniques for live-line working were developed in the early years of the 20th century, and both equipment and work methods were later refined to deal with increasingly higher voltages. In the 1960s, methods were developed in the laboratory to enable field workers to come into direct contact with high voltage lines. Such methods can be applied to enable safe work at the highest transmission voltages.  Background  In general it is impossible to determine visually whether electrical equipment is energized; in any event it is often necessary to maintain or repair circuits while they are in operation. In addition, at high voltages it is unnecessary to come into direct contact with charged equipment to be shocked, because an arc can jump from the equipment to a tool or part of the body, and materials such as rubber, while excellent insulators at low voltages, are also subject to electrical failure at high voltages.  Methods  medium voltage network In general, there are three methods of live-line working which help workers avoid the considerable hazards of live line working. In various ways, they all serve to prevent current flowing from the live equipment through the worker. ; Hot stick or Live Line Tool : Hot sticks are used in live line work by having the worker remain at a specified distance from the live parts and carry out the work by means of an insulating stick. Tools can be attached to the stick, allowing work to be performed with the worker himself safely away from the live conductors. ; Insulating Gloves or Rubber Gloves : A live line worker is electrically protected by insulating gloves and other insulating equipment, and carries out the work in direct mechanical contact with live parts. ; Barehand or Potential : The barehanded approach has a live line worker performing the work in direct electric contact with live parts. Before contact, the worker's body is raised to the same electric potential as the live parts, and then held there by electric connection, while maintaining suitable isolation from the surroundings which are at different potentials, like the ground, other people or trees. Because the worker and the work are at the same potential, no current flows through the worker. ; Unearthed or De- energised : Some organizations additionally consider working on unearthed de- energised equipment to be another form of live-line working. This is because the line might become inadvertently charged (e.g. through a back-charged transformer, possibly as a result of an improperly connected, inadequately isolated emergency generator at a customer facility), or inductively coupled from an adjacent in-service line. To prevent this, the line is first grounded via a clamp known as a bond or drain earth. Once this is in place, further work is not considered to be live-line working. = Hot stick = Hot-stick working appeared in the second decade of the 20th century, when insulating poles made from baked wood were used for tasks such as replacing fuses, replacing post insulators, and transferring lines onto temporary supports. The sticks enabled the linemen to carry out the work without infringing on the minimum clearance distances from live equipment. As experience with the techniques developed, then the operating voltages at which the work was performed increased. With the advent of fibreglass poles in the late 1950s, which neither split nor soaked up rainwater, utilities were prepared to carry out hot-stick working to their highest operating voltages, perhaps 765 kV. Tools, such as hooks or socket wrenches can be mounted at the end of the pole. More sophisticated poles can accept pneumatically or hydraulically driven power tools which allow, for example, bolts to be unscrewed remotely. A rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools at the end of a pole that is several metres long. =Insulating glove or rubber glove working= Usually applied for work above 1 kV AC 1.5 kV DC The primary classes are: *Class 00 - phase to phase working voltage 500 V *Class 0 - phase to phase working voltage 1.0 kV *Class 1 - phase to phase working voltage 7.5 kV *Class 2 - phase to phase working voltage 17 kV *Class 3 - phase to phase working voltage 26.5 kV *Class 4 - phase to phase working voltage 36 kV Gloves protect the worker from exposure to the live part being worked upon sometimes referred to as the 1st point of contact; the point where current would enter the body should an inadvertent contact be made. Covers of insulating material such as blankets and linehose are employed in rubber glove working to protect the worker from exposure to a part at a different potential sometimes referred to as the 2nd point of contact; the point where current would leave the body should an inadvertent contact be made. = Bare hand = Bare-hand, or potential working involves placing the worker in direct electrical contact with an energized overhead line. The worker might work alongside the lines, from a platform that is suspended from them, or may sit or stand directly on the line itself. In all cases, the worker's body is maintained at the same voltage as the line. It is imperative that the worker maintain appropriate and adequate limits of approach to any part at a different potential. Such techniques were first used in 1960. There are a number of ways in which the worker can access the live parts: * The worker can access from a specialist type of mobile elevating work platform (MEWP) termed an insulating aerial device (IAD) which has a boom of insulating material and which all conductive parts at the platform end are bonded together. There are other requirements for safe working such as gradient control devices, a means of preventing a vacuum in the hydraulic lines, etc. * The worker can stand on an insulating ladder which is maneuvered to the line by means of non-conductive rope. * The worker is lowered from a helicopter and transfers himself to the line. * The worker is brought alongside the wire in a hovering helicopter and works from that position. As the lineman approaches the wire, an arc will form between them as the worker is charged. This arc can be debilitating, and the worker must immediately bond himself electrically to the line to prevent further arcing. A worker may use a conducting wand during the approach to first make the connection. Once on the line, the worker is safe from shock as both the lineman and the wire are at the same electric potential, and no current passes through his body. This is the same principle that allows birds to safely alight on power lines. When the work is completed, the process is reversed to remove the worker safely from the wire. Barehand working provides the lineman with greater dexterity than the hot stick method, and may be the preferred option if conditions permit it. With this technique, insulator strings, conductor spacers and vibration dampers can be replaced, or lines spliced, without any loss of supply. The strong electric field surrounding charged equipment is enough to drive a current of approximately 15 μA for each kV·m−1 through a human body. To prevent this, hot-hand workers are usually required to wear a Faraday suit. This is a set of overalls made from or woven throughout with conducting fibers. The suit is in effect a wearable Faraday cage, which equalizes the potential over the body, and ensures there is no through-tissue current. Conducting gloves, even conducting socks, are also necessary, leaving only the face uncovered. There is little practical upper voltage limit for hot-hand working, and it has been successfully performed at some of the highest transmission operating voltages in the world, such as the Russian 1150 kV system. = Helicopter = A lineman wearing a Faraday suit can work on live, high-power lines by being transported to the lines in a helicopter. The worker can perform maintenance sitting on an outrigger platform attached to the helicopter while the aircraft hovers next to the line. When approaching the line a long wand is touched to the line to equalize the potential of the aircraft to that of the line, then a breakaway bonding wire connected to the helicopter's frame is attached to the line during work. Alternatively the worker can transfer to the wires from the helicopter and crawl down the wires, then be picked up by the helicopter after the work is completed.  Eye protection  An electric arc is extremely bright, including in the ultraviolet, and can cause arc eye, a painful and potentially blinding condition. Workers may be provided with appropriately tinted goggles that protect their vision in the event of a flash, and provide defence against debris ejected by an arc.

Anton Bruun described it as \\"unquestionably the strangest catch of the Galathea Expedition, and altogether one of the oddest creatures in the teeming variety of the fish world.\\" On discovery, it was thought to represent a new genus, and was given the name Galatheathauma axeli (the genus being named after their ship, and the species name a tribute to Prince Axel of Denmark). The discoverers were aware of a previously discovered anglerfish with the esca (light organ) in its mouth, Thaumatichthys pagidostomus, but because the only specimen of T. pagidostomus had been measured at 8 cm, it was considered unlikely to be of the same genus. Later, it was realized that the size difference was attributable to age, and Galatheathauma was merged with Thaumatichthys.

His use of techniques like: combined prints, montages and solarizations led to \\"often romantic and mysterious images\\". \\"Edmund Teske; Created Ethereal Photos\\" LA Times, November 26, 1996, Accessed online, April 31, 2014 Although he exhibited extensively and was well known within artistic photography circles during his lifetime, his work was not widely known by the public. He has been called \\"one of the forgotten greats of American photography.\\" Biography Teske was born in Chicago, the eldest of three children born to Rudolph and Olga Teske. His parents were from Poland. When he was 8 years old his family moved to Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, where they took up farming. During this period Teske developed his first artistic interests by experimenting with painting and poetry. In 1921 his family moved back to Chicago, and Teske began to study music, primarily the piano and saxophone. Two years later his grammar school teacher, Mabel Morehouse, introduced him to photography and let him develop his own photos in the school darkroom. For the next decade he spent most of his free time practicing both the piano and photography, and by 1932 he was accomplished enough in the piano that he became the protégé of concert pianist Ida Lustgarten. At the same time his photographic skills had advanced to the point that he was given his first one- man exhibition at the Blackstone Theatre in Chicago. The following year he began to pursue photography as a career and worked full-time at a Chicago studio called Photography Inc. In 1936 he traveled to New York to meet with Alfred Stieglitz, who encouraged and inspired him. That same year he met Frank Lloyd Wright at his Taliesin studio in Wisconsin. At Wright's invitation Teske created a photographic workshop within Taliesin to artistically document Wright's many architectural projects and to explore new relationships between architecture and photography. During Teske's many visits to Taliesin, Wright and other artists and musicians who stayed there helped Teske form his ideas about the role of artists in society and the importance of imparting social messages in his work. The professional relationship with Wright greatly enhanced Teske's reputation, and over the next five years Teske met and sometimes worked with some of the greatest photographers of the time, including Ansel Adams, Paul Strand, László Moholy-Nagy and Berenice Abbott. He taught briefly with Moholy-Nagy at the New Bauhaus in Chicago, and in 1939 he worked as an assistant in Abbott's studio in New York. During this period he also started work on a sequence of photographs he called Portrait of My City, in which he documented scenes of Chicago with a particular focus on the social issues of the time. He also was introduced to the photographs of Man Ray, which inspired him to create his own images containing positive and negative elements. When World War II broke out, Teske was drafted for military duty, but he failed his medical exam for \\"asocial tendencies, psychoneurosis and emotional instability.\\" These were thought to have been medical code words to indicate his growing sexual interests in other men. As an alternative to military service Teske was appointed by the War Department to work as an assistant photographer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois, where he printed aerial maps for military use. During this time he photographed two of his male co-workers nude while expressing his inner challenges in his journal: > Strive to accept the facts of life with courage and serenity to develop > talent, as an outlet for emotion, and to find happiness in the world of the > mind and spirit. In the days when Greece and Rome ruled the world in arts > and letters and philosophy, love of man for man reached openly its pinnacle > of beauty. Civilization today, moving forward, must eventually recognize > these true facts of love and sex variations. In early 1943 Teske was able to leave his position at Rock Island, and compelled by the thought of a new way of life and the rising romantic allure of Hollywood, he decided to move to Los Angeles. He stopped briefly at Wright's Taliesin West in Arizona to photograph the architect's vision there, finally arriving in Los Angeles in April. He started working in the photographic still department at Paramount Pictures, and he quickly inserted himself into the growing artistic and bohemian movement in the city. By coincidence he met Aline Barnsdall, a wealthy client of Wright, and she invited him to live in part of a large and then unfinished project called Olive Hill that Wright had begun for Barnsdall but had never finished due to differences of opinion about the design and the cost. She intended him to be caretaker for the property, but with her indulgence he soon assumed a much larger role. Teske started hosting informal parties and artistic gatherings in the rambling spaces of his new home. He grew a beard and \\"took on the trappings of a bohemian lifestyle.\\". Because of the expansive surroundings of Olive Hill and Teske's newly uninhibited lifestyle, his parties became a magnet for the creative minds of Hollywood and Los Angeles, including Man Ray, Anaïs Nin, George Cukor, Frances Dee, Joel McCrea, Tony Smith and John Whitney. During this time Teske met Christopher Isherwood, who introduced him to the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta. Teske soon embraced the philosophy, in part because its teachings provided a grounding for how he already viewed life and in part because Isherwood and his friends were already part of the growing gay community in the city. Teske was fascinated with the Vedanta ideas that all aspects of life and nature are connected and that time exists only as it relates to other moments in a large universe. He began to experiment with the concept that a regular photographic image could not define a moment in life, and that only multiple images portrayed together could convey what he called \\"universal essences.\\" Throughout the rest of his life he continued to produce composite prints made by sandwiching two or more negatives together. Many of these images are now his signature photographs. During this time he also experimented with a variety of other photographic techniques, including solarization and collages. In 1949 Teske left Olive Hill and moved to a small studio in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. He launched into a series of creative photographic experiments in which he both manipulated and combined multiple images to create \\"new pictorial realities\\". In one of these series, which he called \\"Shiva-Shakti\\", he printed an image of a nude male relaxing on his back with his penis fully exposed and, in separate photographs, overlaid this image with others that included landscapes, rooms, human faces, or completely abstract subjects. Although Teske had photographed nude men throughout his life, this series, with the repeated image of the reclining man, reintroduced \\"the sensuality of male imagery in his work\\" in the context of his exploration of Vedantic philosophy. As Teske continued to contemplate the complex teachings of Vedanta, his delved further into using his photography to translate his feelings into imagery. Throughout the 1950s he experimented with new chemical and manipulative techniques, culminating in 1958 when he perfected a combination of photographic print toning and solarization. Edward Steichen coined the term \\"duotone solarization\\" to describe this new technique. In 1959 the Museum of Modern Art purchased nine of his prints, further escalating his fame within the photographic world. The 1960s and '70s were the busiest time in his career. During this period he was given at least eighteen one-man exhibitions and took part in more than two dozen other group exhibitions. He met and sometimes taught with many of the important photographers of the time, including Aaron Siskind, Harry Callahan, Wynn Bullock, Jack Welpott, and Judy Dater. During this period he also befriended Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors, and took a series of informal portraits of Morrison and his girlfriend Pamela Courson. During the last twenty years of his life Teske both worked and lived in his studio in East Hollywood, where he regularly taught workshops and mentored both younger and older photographers who sought his knowledge about art and philosophy. When he was asked by a reporter if he had any advice to give to new photographers, Teske replied, \\"Yes. Meditate!\\" Around 1990 Teske embarked on assembling a comprehensive autobiographical collection of his work. Within a short time he had created a six-volume maquette he called ‘’Emanations,\\" which he hoped would not only show his work as he wanted it to be seen but also tell the story of his life. He never found a publisher for the work. The 1994 Northridge earthquake severely damaged Teske's studio, and he was forced to move out. He was living by himself in downtown Los Angeles when he died in his bed on November 22, 1996. In his obituary in the Los Angeles Times, photographic historian Weston Naef wrote that Teske will \\"enter the history books as the grand master of a style of picture that is taken for granted now that computers have created ways to cut and paste images seamlessly.\\" Teske was given a posthumous retrospective at the J. Paul Getty Museum in 2004. References http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/teske/ Spirit into Matter: The Photographs of Edmund Teske. J.

He was created by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon, and first appeared in The Punisher Vol. 5, #2 (May 2000).  Publication history  Martin Soap debuted in The Punisher Vol. 5, #2 and appeared in every subsequent installment of the series up to Issue #12. The character was then featured in seventeen issues of the following volume, with his final appearance being in The Punisher Vol. 6, #37.  Fictional character biography  Moments after his birth, Soap was dropped on his head by a nurse. He was then abandoned at an orphanage in Dunmore, New Jersey, where he remained from 1971 to 1987. Soap was bullied by the staff and the other children, and during one unsuccessful attempt at running away he was inspired to become a police officer by the alcoholic detective who brought him back to the orphanage. Soap rose through the ranks of the NYPD to become a detective himself, despite all of his cases being botched by an improbable turn of events, such as a judge being declared insane, or an entire jury taking ecstasy. When the Punisher resurfaces and declares war on the Gnucci crime family, Soap is assigned to the Punisher Task Force, a sinecure with only one other member, a neurotic behavioral psychologist named Buddy Plugg. After Soap criticizes his profile of the Punisher, the distraught Plugg hangs himself in his and Soap's shared office. Soap is later approached by Molly von Richthofen, a lieutenant, and the sole member of another pointless task force, one supposedly dedicated to dismantling the Gnucci family. The two join forces, and stake out Ma Gnucci's mansion, intending to step in and arrest whoever remains after the Punisher inevitably lays siege to the building. Over the course of their investigation, Soap and Molly become friends, and remain so even after Molly shoots down Soap's attempt to pursue a romantic relationship with her by revealing that she is a lesbian. After killing Ma Gnucci and destroying her mansion, the Punisher confronts Soap and Molly, and offers them Ma's compromising photographs of the mayor and the police commissioner in exchange for all of the information that the NYPD has pertaining to the Vigilante Squad. With the photographs, Soap is able to blackmail his way into becoming the new commissioner; while Soap is basking in his good fortune, a bird defecates on his head. Soap is demoted back to detective and once again assigned to the Punisher Task Force after pictures of him soliciting a prostitute surface. The dismayed Soap attempts suicide, but is stopped by the Punisher, who convinces Soap to become his informant within the NYPD. After Soap kills serial killer John \\"Bubba\\" Prong in self-defense, Soap is promoted to Lieutenant.The Punisher (vol. 6) #14 Soap is later taken hostage by hired goons working for ruthless tabloid reporter Chuck Self, who forces the Punisher to take Self along with him while the Punisher spends a night killing gangsters and petty criminals. If Castle fails to comply with Self's orders, Self will text- message his men to kill Soap. During the course of being chased by gang members and Mafiosos, Self is injured several times while the Punisher himself remained unscathed. Self is later killed by accidentally falling into a wood chipper, and Castle returns to save Soap by killing Self's thugs. The Punisher leaves Self's mangled corpse on the hood of his own car, then Castle and Soap walk away.The Punisher (vol. 6) #15 Soap is seen as a bar regular, falsely believing the bartender, Kevin, to be one of his true friends. Kevin is amused by Soap's lack of awareness when choosing dates, including, but not limited to, a killer ex-con, a transvestite and a woman Kevin believes is Soap's own long-lost mother. When Soap nearly kills himself with a gun in the men's bathroom, Kevin intervenes and Soap believes that it's out of concern for his well-being. But when Kevin makes a snarky comment because he didn't want a mess and preferred Soap to kill himself at his home, Soap snaps at Kevin, threatens him with his gun and terrifies him before storming off, having found self-confidence in himself. Soap tries to arrest the Punisher, but fails to stop him. Soap then becomes despondent; Castle then tells Soap when things aren't getting better, to \\"just go\\".The Punisher (vol. 6) #37 Soap leaves the NYPD, moves to Los Angeles and becomes a porn star. Up to that point, he had simply been unaware that he has large genitals.The Punisher (vol. 6) #37  Other versions  = Marvel Noir = In the Marvel Noir universe, Soap is a competent NYPD Detective investigating the murder of Frank Castelione, and the murders committed by Frank's son, Frank Castelione, Jr. (who became the Punisher). The case is declared closed when Frank, Jr. kills the Russian, and makes it look like he was the Punisher. Despite there being circumstantial evidence of a frame-up, Soap is content, and obeys his superior's orders to not continue his investigation of the Punisher.  In other media  = Film = * Soap appears in the 2008 film Punisher: War Zone, played by Dash Mihok. He is portrayed as a clumsy and overly self-important man, with a degree in behavioral psychology and almost no aptitude for actually confronting criminals (there are several scenes where he is shown fumbling with his own pistol). As a joke, his superiors assign him to the Punisher Task Force, a meaningless sinecure which consists solely of Soap, since the NYPD is fully in sympathy with the Punisher's actions, but has to cosmetically appear as though it is trying to discourage vigilantism. Soap is partnered with Paul Budiansky, an FBI agent fixated on apprehending the Punisher, who had killed an undercover agent by mistake. Midway through the film, it is revealed that Soap is actually one of the Punisher's allies, feeding him information on his various targets. By the time Budiansky has figured this out, he has realized how evil the criminals they are up against are, and how powerless the \\"system\\" is to punish them. Soap and Budiansky both assist the Punisher in rescuing the dead agent's family from Jigsaw. In the aftermath, Soap starts to walk the Punisher home, beginning an unsolicited lecture on the benefits of mercy and rehabilitation instead of outright execution - but halts when he is menaced by a mugger, whom the Punisher kills. = Video games = * Martin Soap appears in the 2004 Punisher video game, voiced by Michael Gough. In the game, he and Molly von Richthofen interrogate the captured Punisher on Ryker's Island before John Saint/Jigsaw leads a breakout thanks to his Yakuza gang. Flashbacks reveal that Soap is secretly allied with the Punisher, regularly forwarding him information about various criminals. In one level, the Punisher enters a bar in order to kill Mafioso Bobbie Gnucci (son of Ma Gnucci) and his entourage. Soap is present, but misses the shootout due to being in the restroom vomiting, partly from alcohol consumption, and partly due to fear of Gnucci's thugs. Soap exits the restroom after the Punisher leaves the premises, sees the mess, and proclaims, \\"Damn it, Castle, this was my favorite bar!\\"  References   External links  * Martin Soap at Comicvine * Martin Soap at Marvel Wikia * Fictional orphans Punisher characters Characters created by Garth Ennis Fictional pornographic film actors Comics characters introduced in 2000 Fictional characters from New Jersey Fictional New York City Police Department detectives Fictional New York City Police Department lieutenants ","title":"Martin Soap"},{"id":"20587887","text":"Gringo is an unincorporated community in Hopewell Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, United States.

It is written by Gordon Korman, and was published by Scholastic on December 2, 2008.Amazon: One False Note Retrieved on 2009-04-27. Following the events of The Maze of Bones, the protagonists Amy and Dan Cahill learn about Mozart and travel to Vienna, Austria to search for the second clue in the 39 Clues competition. One False Note entered the Children's Books New York Times Best Seller list at number one on December 21, 2008 and stayed on the list for children's chapter books for 12 weeks.  Plot summary  Dan, Amy, and their au pair Nellie, found music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the end of The Maze of Bones, leading them to Vienna, Austria, to learn about him and find a related clue. In Vienna, Amy and Dan discover that Mozart had an older sister: Maria Anna \\"Nannerl\\" Mozart. They go to a library to view her diary, only to realize Jonah Wizard, a fellow competitor in the search for The 39 Clues, stole it. They steal it from him, but then Nellie translates it and notices that three pages are missing. After finding the music from Mozart on the Internet, Amy and Dan notice that three lines are missing from it. They play the missing lines down in the lobby of the hotel they are staying in and realize that they are actually a whole different song that wasn't even written by Mozart. That song's name is \\"The Place Where I Was Born\\", so they go to the place where Mozart was born: Salzburg, Austria. There, they see Alistair Oh (yet another competitor), and follow him into the Salzburg Catacombs. They see the man in black and, shortly afterward, are trapped inside the Catacombs by an explosion that causes a cave-in. However, they find another way out through St. Peter's Archabbey and are chased by monks after finding a sheet of old parchment that supposedly had all 39 clues on it. They are devastated to find that it is just a recipe for Benedictine. Later, Nellie discovers that there is a homing device on the collar of their cat, Saladin. She, Amy, and Dan then find Alistair sleeping on a park bench and decide to plant it on him. Amy finds a secret compartment inside his cane and plants the homing device inside, in exchange taking what he found in the Catacombs, an eighteenth-century concert poster starring Mozart in Venice, Italy. In Venice, Amy and Dan follow Jonah Wizard and find a secret passage from a music store called \\"Disco Volante\\" to a Janus stronghold. There, they find the missing diary pages and steal them from Jonah while he is examining them. They are chased by Janus agents but hide the pages on a boat called the Royal Saladin to come back to collect them once they lose the Janus. The pages say that Nannerl thought her brother was going crazy because he was buying large quantities of an expensive Japanese steel and getting himself into major debt. A name, Fidelio Racco, which was also found on the paper taken from Alistair Oh, appears in the diary, along with two notes from Grace: \\"The word that cost her life, minus the music\\" and \\"D>HIC\\". They figure out that \\"the word that cost her her life\\" was referring to Marie Antoinette's famous quote, \\"Let them eat cake.\\", when she was told the peasants had no bread. Amy recalls from a conversation with Grace that Marie Antoinette used the most common French word for cake, gateau instead of brioche which is what she is usually quoted with. However, they do not know what Grace means by \\"minus the music\\" or \\"D>HIC\\", so they go to Fidelio Racco's mansion (which is now a museum) and hide until after it closes. They then sneak over to Fidelio Racco's harpsichord but are ambushed by the Kabras, who have been following them since Paris. Ian plays Mozart's music on the harpsichord but is unaware of the booby trapped D key, which Amy realizes the meaning of D>HIC, meaning D over High C. She tries to knock Ian off the bench, but she is too late. His finger brushes the booby trapped key, and an explosion sends them both flying into the air. Amy manages to tuck and roll when she hits the ground, but Ian whacks his head on the marble floor and is knocked unconscious. Natalie is also knocked out after Dan stabs her with a dart from her tranquilizer dart gun. Most of the harpsichord is vaporized in the explosion, but the keyboard is still intact, so Amy plays \\"The Place Where I Was Born\\". A section of the floor drops down, revealing two Japanese swords and the second clue, [Tungsten]. Amy figures out that gateau minus the music means that she needs to take out all of the letters that are musical notes, which leaves her with T-U, the chemical symbol for tungsten. Back at their hotel in Venice, Amy and Dan tell Nellie about the second clue, and she calls Japan Airlines to book three tickets to Tokyo. The book ends with Alistair Oh finding out who is owner of the tracking device that was placed on Saladin and himself. That person is Grace's lawyer and friend, William McIntyre.

In the present, South Korea plays an active role in the ongoing Digital Revolution, with one of the largest electronics industries and most innovative economies in the world. Agriculture * Soybean cultivation : Early cultivation of the soybean dates back to 4,000 years ago, and originates in Manchuria and the Korean peninsula. Early Chinese records mention that soybeans were gifted from the region encompassing Manchuria and Korea. The first unambiguously domesticated, cultigen-sized soybean was discovered in Korea at the Mumun- period Daundong site. *Rice seed : The world's oldest rice seed was discovered in the village of Sorori in the Chungbuk province of Korea, dated 15,000–17,000 years ago. * Heated greenhouse : The first description of a heated greenhouse is from the Sanga Yorok, a treatise on husbandry compiled by a royal physician of the Joseon dynasty of Korea during the 1450s, in its chapter on cultivating vegetables during winter. The treatise contains detailed instructions on constructing a greenhouse that is capable of cultivating vegetables, forcing flowers, and ripening fruit within an artificially heated environment, by utilizing ondol, the traditional Korean underfloor heating system, to maintain heat and humidity; cob walls to insulate heat; and semi-transparent oiled hanji windows to permit light penetration for plant growth and provide protection from the outside environment. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty confirm that greenhouse-like structures incorporating ondol were constructed to provide heat for mandarin orange trees during the winter of 1438. * Rain gauge : The first standardized rain gauge, called the cheugugi, was invented during the reign of Sejong the Great in the Joseon dynasty of Korea. The cheugugi was used throughout the country for official purposes. In the 15th century, Korea was the only country to use a quantitative measuring device for the purpose of meteorological observation. * Korean hand plow : The homi, which dates back to the Bronze Age, is one of the most representative agricultural tools of Korea. Its signature tapered blade was developed during the Later Silla period. In recent times, the homi (known by names such as the \\"Ho-Mi EZ Digger\\" and \\"Korean hand plow\\") has gained popularity in the West. Aquaculture Bangudae petroglyphs *Fishing net : Limestone net sinkers discovered in Korea dating to 27,000 BC are the earliest evidence of fishing by nets and also the oldest fishing implements found to date in the world. *Whaling : The earliest depictions of whaling have been discovered in Korea at the Neolithic Bangudae site, which may date back to 6000 BC. Bangudae is the earliest evidence for whaling. *Seaweed farming : The earliest cultivation of gim, an edible seaweed, was started by Kim Yeo-ik () in the middle of the 17th century. *Pollock farming : In 2016, the National Institute of Fisheries Science of South Korea succeeded in farming Alaska pollock for the first time in the world, allowing the fish to lay eggs a year and 8 months after birth, as opposed to 3 years in the wild. Alaska pollock is considered the \\"national fish\\" of Korea and is prepared in a number of dishes, including myeongnan-jeot, which was introduced and popularized in Japan as \\"mentaiko\\" in the 20th century. Architecture In the ondol system, heat and smoke from the kitchen stove circulates under the building, warming the floors, then exits through the chimneys. Namhan Mountain Fortress Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda * Underfloor heating : One of the earliest systems of underfloor heating, dating back 2,500 years, was invented and widely used by Koreans. The Korean ondol heating system was thought to be the oldest of its kind until the recent archaeological discovery of a similar heating system in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands. However, the archaeologist who discovered it agrees with Korean researchers that the two systems developed independently, based on the distance of 5,000 kilometers and the absence of ondol in the areas between them. Some Korean researchers have explained this phenomenon by hypothesizing that a whale-hunting people from the Korean Peninsula migrated by sea to Alaska during prehistoric times. Inspired by the Korean ondol hydronic radiant floor heating system, the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright developed and introduced the first \\"radiant heating system\\" using hot water pipes. * Refrigeration : The ancient Silla kingdom created an early refrigeration system called seokbinggo, which were subterranean chambers used to store ice and food. *Korean fortress : Koreans developed a unique and distinct fortress tradition. Korean fortresses were based on a stone culture and built with stones on natural mountainous terrain; therefore, they are conceptually completely different compared to Chinese fortresses, which were based on an earth culture and built with bricks and stamped earth on flat land. Korean fortresses were invented by Goguryeo and spread to Baekje and Silla, and then inherited and further developed by Goryeo and then Joseon. Goguryeo fortress ruins have been found in about 170 sites to date, including in China; one of the most notable among them is Ansi Fortress, which successfully defended against Tang Taizong during the Goguryeo–Tang War. Korea, beginning with Goguryeo, has been called \\"a country of fortresses\\"; almost 2,400 mountain fortress sites have been found in Korea. Korean-style fortresses can also be found in Japan, which were constructed and supervised by immigrants of Baekje origin. *Korean pagoda : Koreans created a unique and distinct pagoda tradition using stone. Pagodas were created in India using earth, then in China using wood, which spread to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, and then Japan; however, the pagoda tradition of East Asia diverged, with China creating pagodas using bricks, Korea creating pagodas using stone, and Japan continuing to use wood. Korean stone pagodas were first created in Baekje during the early 7th century and then inherited by Later Silla; 90% of the pagodas in Later Silla were made of stone. The stone pagoda tradition was propagated by the great abundance of high quality granite in Korea, which also led to other granite creations such as the Seokguram and Cheomseongdae. Goryeo, a devoutly Buddhist state, also inherited the stone pagoda tradition. Astronomy *Star chart : The earliest known constellation patterns in Korea can be found on dolmens dating back to 3000 BC. The Cheonsang Yeolcha Bunyajido is a planisphere inscribed on black marble that was completed in 1395 during the reign of King Taejo; according to its inscription, it is based on a star chart from ancient Goguryeo that was lost during wartime. It is known as the world’s second oldest star chart engraved in stone, after the Chinese Suzhou Star Chart of 1247. However, the Cheonsang Yeolcha Bunyajido's stellar positions indicate an epoch dating back to the first century AD, thus making it the oldest actual representation of the stars in the world. *Astronomical observatory : The Cheomseongdae is the oldest surviving astronomical observatory in Asia, and possibly the world. It was constructed in Seorabeol, the capital of Silla, during the reign of Queen Seondeok in the 7th century. Modeled on Baekje's Jeomseongdae, which now exists only in historical records, the Cheomseongdae influenced the construction of a Japanese observatory in 675, and Duke Zhou's observatory in China in 723. Mathematics Gusuryak by Choi Seok-jeong, published in 1700 *Latin square : The first literature on the Latin square dates back to the monograph Gusuryak () by the Joseon mathematician Choi Seok-jeong (1646–1715), predating Leonhard Euler by at least 67 years. *Hexagonal tortoise problem : The hexagonal tortoise problem () was invented by Choi Seok-jeong during the Joseon period. *Ree group : The Korean mathematician Rimhak Ree discovered and constructed the Ree group in the mathematical field of group theory. *Chisanbop : Chisanbop is an abacus-like calculation system using fingers that was invented in Korea in the 1940s and brought to the West in the 1970s. Writing The Tale of Chunhyang in Hangul * Featural writing system : Hangul is the world's first featural writing system, wherein the shapes of the letters are not arbitrary, but encode phonological features of the phonemes they represent. The Korean alphabet is unique among the world's writing systems, in that it combines aspects of featural, phonemic, and syllabic representation. Hangul, originally named Hunminjeongeum, was personally created by Sejong the Great to promote literacy among the common people. *Phonemic orthography : Predating the creation of Hangul by hundreds of years, Koreans created various phonetic writing systems that were used in conjunction with Hanja, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. Some of them may have influenced the development of kana in Japan. Printing Jikji, the oldest surviving book printed with movable metal type * Movable type : Movable metal type was invented in Korea in the early thirteenth century, predating Gutenberg's invention in Europe by two centuries and advancing the movable type technology developed in the Song dynasty of China. The first book to be printed with movable metal type is the Prescribed Ritual Texts of the Past and Present in 1234 during the Goryeo period. The earliest surviving book to be printed with movable metal type is the Jikji, dated to 1377. The first lead type in the world is the Byeongjinja created in 1436. Metal types were called juja (cast characters), and the Joseon government operated the jujaso bureau, a continuation of Goryeo's seojeogwon, to print books and documents to be distributed to the central and local administrations, village schools, scholars, and officials. * Newspaper : The Jobo, which is discussed in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, is possibly the oldest newspaper in the world. Published in 1577, the Jobo was a privately run commercial newspaper, printed daily, that covered a range of topics, including weather, constellations, and current affairs. In 2017, a Korean monk claimed to have discovered an extant copy of the Jobo. Horology * Mechanical water clock : In 1433, the scientist Jang Yeong-sil invented an automatic time-annunciating clepsydra called the Striking Palace Clepsydra under an order from Sejong the Great; the uniqueness of the clock was its capability to announce dual-times automatically with both visual and audible signals. Jang developed a signal conversion technique that made it possible to measure analog time and announce digital time simultaneously as well as to separate the water mechanisms from the ball-operated striking mechanisms. The conversion device was called pangmok, and was placed above the inflow vessel that measured the time, the first device of its kind in the world. Thus, the Striking Palace Clepsydra is the first hydro-mechanically engineered dual-time clock in the history of horology. *Braille smartwatch : The world's first Braille smartwatch, called the Dot, was developed by a Korean startup company. The Dot features a tactile button display and uses Bluetooth to connect to electronic devices. Military =Traditional= 18th century depiction of the geobukseon *Iron plate armor : Iron plate armor was used by Silla and Gaya beginning in the early 4th century. According to the Gyeongju National Museum, \\"The armor excavated from historic sites in Gujeongdong is plate armor, consisting of a number of long iron plates vertically linked with one another, a feature that is unique to armor found on the Korean Peninsula.\\" * Hwacha : The hwacha is a mobile multiple rocket launcher that uses gunpowder to fire up to 200 singijeon rockets at one time. The hwacha was invented in 1409, but saw its greatest use during the Imjin War, most famously in the Battle of Haengju. Hwachas were used against both land and sea targets. * Naval artillery : The Koreans were innovators in the development of naval artillery, and produced the most advanced naval cannons in East Asia. In 1380, 100 Goryeo ships armed with gunpowder weapons destroyed 500 Wokou ships at the Battle of Jinpo. *Armored warship : The turtle ship, also known as the geobukseon, was the first armored warship in the world. Turtle ships were built during the Joseon dynasty beginning in the early 15th century up until the 19th century, but are most often associated with Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who used them in battle against the Japanese in the Imjin War (1592–1598). * Bulletproof vest : The myeonje baegab was a soft bulletproof vest invented in 1867 in the Joseon dynasty. *Thousand paces gun : The cheonbochong (), or the \\"thousand paces gun\\", was a type of jochong matchlock musket invented in Joseon during the reign of King Sukjong (1674–1720). Compared to other jochongs of the time that had a range of 120m, the cheonbochong was recorded to have a range of 1200m. *Time bomb : The pigyok chinchollae (), also called the Flying Thunderbolt, was a time bomb with an adjustable fuse mechanism that was invented by Yi Jangson and first used in the Imjin War at the Battle of Gyeongju in 1592. It was projected into enemy camps and formations using the wangu mortar, and also used at sea. *Machine gun :Perhaps the earliest predecessor to the modern machine gun are the chongtong (gun barrel) hwachas of the 15th century. The first of these were created in 1409, in which dozens of stacked rows of bronze gun barrels fired iron bolts.https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=529106&cid;=46637&categoryId;=46637 The Moonjong hwacha in 1451 carried 50 gun barrels which each fired sequentially 4 bolts each.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJXrk-diGNE The \\"box\\" of gun barrels was modular and could be installed and removed on the firing carriage. The gun-barrel type (as opposed to the rocket type) of hwacha predates the weapons considered the earliest forms of machine guns outside of Korea, the Chinese 'Po-Tzu Lien-Chu-P'ao' or 'string-of-100-bullets cannon' developed in the first quarter of the 17th century. The later jujachongtong hwacha developed in 1490 fired 15 iron bullets per barrel, and hundreds of the weapons were produced and deployed throughout the nation.https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1631157&cid;=42955&categoryId;=42955https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTWllcu_3-I =Modern= *Sentry guard robot : In 2006, Samsung Techwin released the Samsung SGR-A1, a sentry guard robot designed to replace human counterparts at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. It is the first of its kind to have surveillance, tracking, firing, and voice-recognition systems built into a single unit. *Super aEgis II : In 2010, DoDaam Systems introduced the Super aEgis II, one of a new breed of automated weapon that can identify, track, and destroy a moving target at a distance of 4 km. *Airburst assault rifle : Daewoo's K11 is the first gun of its kind to be operational in the field, making the Republic of Korea Army the first in the world to use an airburst assault rifle as standard issue. Traditional medicine * Kiln sauna : The traditional Korean sauna, called the hanjeungmak, is a domed structure constructed of stone that was first mentioned in the Sejong Sillok of the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty in the 15th century. Supported by Sejong the Great, the hanjeungmak was touted for its health benefits and used to treat illnesses. In the early 15th century, Buddhist monks maintained hanjeungmak clinics, called hanjeungso, to treat sick poor people; these clinics maintained separate facilities for men and women due to high demand. Korean sauna culture and kiln saunas are still popular today, and Korean saunas are ubiquitous. *Hand acupuncture : Koryo hand acupuncture is a modern system of acupuncture, created by Yu Tae-u in the 1970s, in which the hand represents the entire body and is needled or stimulated during treatment. Hand acupuncture is popular among the general population as a form of self- medication in Korea, and has adherents in Japan and North America; it is also popular among overseas Koreans. Korean hand acupuncture is different from American hand reflexology, another form of alternative medicine. *Primo vascular system : The primo vascular system, also known as the Bong-Han system, is a new circulatory system discovered by Kim Bong-Han, a professor at the Pyongyang Medical University, in 1961. It is differentiated from the arteriovenous and lympathic systems by its unique anatomical and immunohistochemical signature. Originally named the \\"Substance of Kyungrak\\", Professor Kim proposed that the system represents the meridians and collaterals of acupuncture. The primo vascular system was scientifically confirmed in 2002.

One of two stadiums designed by Charles Wellford Leavitt, civil engineer, city planner and landscape architect. Charles Wellford Leavitt (1871-1928) was an American landscape architect, urban planner, and civil engineer who designed everything from elaborate gardens on Long Island, New York and New Jersey estates to federal parks in Cuba, hotels in Puerto Rico, plans of towns in Florida, New York and elsewhere. New York publisher Julius David Stern called Leavitt \\"a rare combination of engineer, artist, and diplomat\\", and the multi-faceted career chosen by Leavitt, veering between public and private commissions and embracing everything from hard-edged engineering to sensuous garden design, and calling for negotiations with everyone from wealthy entrepreneurs to county commissioners, called for an individual with singular talents.Memoirs of the Maverick Publisher, Julius David Stern, Simon and Schuster, 1962, p. 154 Leavitt was one of the preeminent landscape architects of his era and helped found the study of landscape architecture at New York City's Columbia University, where he was one of the first three professors in the University's new four-year program in the discipline. Early life Sarah Allibone Leavitt by Cecilia Beaux Charles Wellford Leavitt Jr. was born in Riverton, New Jersey, on March 13, 1871, the son of Charles Wellford Sr. and Sarah (Allibone) Leavitt.Charles Wellford Leavitt Sr. and Sarah (Allibone) Leavitt named another son William Foster Biddle Leavitt for the uncle of painter Cecilia Beaux, granddaughter of John Wheeler Leavitt. He was educated at The Gunnery school in Washington, Connecticut, and the Cheltenham Military Academy in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania.The Leavitt family were originally from Suffield, Connecticut, and were family relations of the Philadelphia portraitist Cecilia Beaux, one of whose best-known paintings is of Sara (Allibone) Leavitt, mother of Charles Wellford Leavitt the architect. Cecilia Beaux frequently socialized with Charles Wellford Leavitt Sr. and his son Charles, Jr. The Philadelphia portrait painter also executed a painting of Leavitt in 1911 entitled Portrait of Charles Wellford Leavitt, the Artist's Cousin. Charles Wellford Leavitt Jr. married Clara Gordon White at Essex Fells, New Jersey in 1899, and the couple subsequently had four children.The couple's four children were: Gordon, born in 1901; Kent, born in 1903; Charlotte, born in 1906; and Dundas, born 1910. Another daughter died in her infancy. Professional career Leavitt began his career as an assistant engineer in charge of construction with the East Jersey Water Company, then subsequently joined the Caldwell Railway and acted as engineer for the town of Essex Fells, New Jersey, where he directed the engineering and construction of water and sewer facilities, roads and other municipal facilities. By 1897 Leavitt had set up his own practice in New York City, and began to take on large projects in the area of landscape design, civil engineering and architecture.Distinguished Successful Americans of Our Day, Successful Americans Publishing, Chicago, Ill., 1912 Leavitt became a sought-after specialist, particularly in landscape and garden design,As a landscape architect, Leavitt frequently worked with other preeminent architects of the day on plans, including the firm of McKim, Mead & White. and designed the gardens at estates belonging to such figures as Walter P. Chrysler, William C. Whitney, for whom Leavitt also designed a private racetrack on his estate,Gossip of the Horsemen; Preliminary Training Work Begun on Long Island Tracks, Private Track at Westbury, The New York Times, March 19, 1899 Henri Willis Bendel, Daniel S. Lamont, Foxhall P. Keene, Felix M. Warburg,Who's Who in New York (City and State), Herman W.

Fletcher Brown estate is located in Wilmington, Delaware. E. K. Cone, George C. Smith, Issachar Cozzen III, Carlton Macy, George B. Post, Harry K. Knapp, Anson W. Hard and others. Most of Leavitt's landscape commissions were in the New Jersey hunt country and the North Shore of Long Island, but he also worked as far afield as Pasadena, California and Duluth, Minnesota. Sometimes he acted as landscape architect on homes designed by other architects; often he also designed the homes as well as the adjacent landscaping.Long Island Country Houses and Their Architects, 1860-1940, Robert B. MacKay, Anthony K. Baker, Carol A. Traynor, Published by W. W. Norton & Company, 1997 Leavitt's landscape designs ranged from enormous Italianate gardens (Charles Schwab estate, Loretto, Pennsylvania), to more intimate wildflower enclosures (J. A. Haskell estate, Red Bank, New Jersey). Typically, Leavitt's designs for the gardens of the wealthy took account of the local topography, the axis of the home and the local fauna and flora. At Kykuit, the Rockefeller family home, John D. Rockefeller worked with Leavitt on designing approach roads to the estate; his son John D. Rockefeller Jr. then conferred with designer Leavitt on the estate's landscaping, but ultimately chose the landscape architect Welles Bosworth to design the estate's gardens.The House the Rockefellers Built: A Tale of Money, Taste, and Power in Twentieth-Century America, Robert F. Dalzell, Lee Baldwin Dalzell, Published by Macmillan, 2007 \\"Leavitt had the wit to suggest terracing, particularly on the steep slope to the west of the house,\\" write Robert F. and Baldwin Dalzell in The House the Rockefellers Built, \\"but his ideas were trumped by the fortuitous appearance of another contender.\\" Formal gardens, Samuel Untermyer estate, Yonkers, New York, ca. 1900. Charles Wellford Leavitt, landscape architect. Library of Congress Leavitt's design work on estates eventually led him to other far-flung commissions. After designing a home for Foxhall Kenne, for instance, Leavitt subsequently designed several race courses for Kenne, an equestrian and race track owner, including the Empire City Race Track, as well as the tracks at Saratoga, Sheepshead Bay, Belmont Park, Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg. But Leavitt's interests were not limited to confections for the Gilded Age elite. He took a deep interest in city planning, especially that of his adopted city of New York. On January 3, 1922, for instance, Leavitt was moved to write The New York Times concerning the routing of traffic flow, an issue addressed in a recent Times story. \\"The construction, operating, financial and economic aspects of any problem belong to the engineer and his field\\", wrote Leavitt to The Times. \\"This city is rich in her wealth of men of engineering genius and talent.\\" Leavitt went on to praise the work of the city's engineers the previous winter in attempting to channel the city's growing traffic - a solution, Leavitt wrote, that had been largely successful. \\"The only failure seems to have been in the area of publicity\\", he said, \\"Engineering training, although thoroughly practical in many ways, is evidently visionary and weak when it comes to the matter of the creation of headlines.\\"An Engineer on Traffic, Charles Wellford Leavitt, Letter to the Editor, The New York Times, January 3, 1922 In his municipal planning work, Leavitt became a forceful practitioner of the City Beautiful architectural movement of the day. His design for the Lake Mirror Promenade in Lakeland, Florida, executed in the 1920s, is one of the best-known examples of the emerging movement in city planning which altered the course of landscape design and changed the face of urban planning. The promenade circles the side of Lake Mirror on the east side of downtown, and incorporated a loggia, a pedestrian area with a mix of public and private buildings, and a large open circle of lawn designed to accommodate an obelisk sculpture (that was never built).Lakeland's Heritage, Florida History & The Arts, flheritage.com The promenade, with its columns and other architectural elements, was meant to evoke ancient Rome or Greece.A Guide to Historic Lakeland, Florida, Steve Ratjar, The History Press, 2007, 978-1-59629-271-0 In his plan for the University of Georgia campus, executed in 1906, Leavitt helped spearhead the emerging City Beautiful Movement. Leavitt's design hewed to the Beaux Arts style, but paid close attention to the axial relationship of buildings to open space. The Leavitt Plan for the campus remains influential in the University's planning today,Charles Leavitt Master Plan, Master Plan History, University of Georgia Office of University Architects Leavitt's Georgia plans, and other prominent commissions, brought him to the attention of developers such as James Buchanan Duke, who was anxious to convert his in Somerville, New Jersey into a moneyed enclave. In 1910 Duke hired Leavitt as his landscape architect to lay out the winding avenues, concrete walks, \\"and plenty of shade trees and ornamental plants\\" that would lend cache to Duke's proposed development.New Somerville Suburb: Aten Estates Developing Large Tract Near Duke Park, The New York Times, June 5, 1910 In selecting Leavitt, Duke had chosen a landscape architect and engineer who had also worn the developer's hat as well. In the late 19th century, Leavitt had teamed with Philadelphia businessman Anthony S. Drexel to create the New York Suburban Land Company. After learning that the railroads were going to extend service into New Jersey and southward, Drexel sent Leavitt to investigate, later going into business with the architect as well as Drexel's son-in-law John F. Fell. Their resulting partnership purchased from General William J. Gould Encyclopedia of New Jersey, Maxine N. Lurie, Marc Mappen, Rutgers University Press, 2004 for development, and named the community after Fell. (Subsequent tough economic times forced the partnership under management of Drexel's estate - but with engineer Leavitt still in charge).West Essex, Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell and Roseland, Charles A. Poekel Jr., Arcadia Publishing, 1999 Camden County, New Jersey also hired Leavitt after organizing its park commission in 1926. As consulting engineer, Leavitt and his firm were charged with developing a countywide public park and playground system. But Camden County subsequently purchased several properties which, Leavitt argued, were bought solely to enhance the property values of well-connected Camden businessmen - one of whom was the Commissioner of Parks. Although some of Leavitt's early plans were utilized, \\"the Park Commission therefore fired the brilliant engineer and so lost the vital support and support of his patron, Eldridge Johnson, president of the Victor Talking Machine Company.\\"Camden County, New Jersey: The Making of a Metropolitan Community, 1626-2000, Jeffery M. Dorwart, Published by Rutgers University Press, 2001 Leavitt Many former junior partners and consulting engineers at Leavitt's firm, located at 220 Broadway in New York City, later went on to distinguished careers of their own, including Noble Hoggson, the consultant to Seattle's Washington Park Arboretum , influential Minnesota landscape architect Arthur Nichols , Australian architect Norman Weekes , and many others. also designed municipal parks, including the federal parks in Cuba, the Washington Crossing Park on the Delaware River, and did much of the initial town planning of West Palm Beach, Florida, and Garden City, New York, as well as other prominent urban design projects. He served as chief engineer for the Palisades Interstate Park Commission In his role as chief engineer for the PIPC, Leavitt proposed in the 1920s the creation of the Henry Hudson Drive, \\"a rustic roadway many miles in extent with a river view at all points\\" along the length of the Palisades, as Leavitt put it. Following Leavitt's suggestion, the Henry Hudson Drive opened in sections between 1921 and 1926. and designed urban plans for Long Beach; Garden City, Long Island, New York; Monument Valley Park in Colorado Springs, Colorado; the lieutenant governor's residence in Toronto, Ontario; he also designed the stadium grandstand at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field,Fame finally comes to Barney Dreyfuss, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 20, 2008 and was the primary landscape architect for Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.Woodlawn Cemetery, openhousenewyork, ohny.org Glensheen Estate, Minnesota.

Sayles, who died in 1913.Obituary, Robert W.

The first version was released on Jun 9th 1994, after Beta testing at 6 customer sites. Clementine was originally developed by a UK company named Integral Solutions Limited (ISL), in Collaboration with Artificial Intelligence researchers at Sussex University. The original Clementine was implemented in Poplog, which ISL marketed for Sussex University. Clementine mainly used the Poplog languages, Pop11, with some parts written in C for speed (such as the neural network engine), along with additional tools provided as part of Solaris, VMS and various versions of Unix. The tool quickly garnered the attention of the data mining community (at that time in its infancy). In order to reach a larger market, ISL then Ported Poplog to Microsoft Windows using the NutCracker package, later named MKS Toolkit to provide the Unix graphical facilities. Original in many respects, Clementine was the first data mining tool to use an icon based Graphical user interface rather than requiring users to write in a Programming language, though that option remained available for expert users. In 1998 ISL was acquired by SPSS Inc., who saw the potential for extended development as a commercial data mining tool. In early 2000 the software was developed into a client / server architecture, and shortly afterward the client front-end interface component was completely re-written and replaced with a new Java front-end, which allowed deeper integration with the other tools provided by SPSS. SPSS Clementine version 7.0: The client front-end runs under Windows. The server back-end Unix variants (Sun, HP-UX, AIX), Linux, and Windows. The graphical user interface is written in Java. IBM SPSS Modeler 14.0 was the first release of Modeler by IBM. IBM SPSS Modeler 15, released in June 2012, introduced significant new functionality for Social Network Analysis and Entity Analytics.

The company was founded by the Wockenfuss family in 1915. The family immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1887.  Overview  Herman Charles Wockenfuss was born in 1875 in Germany. He came to America in 1887 where he learned how to make candy. In 1915, he opened the Wockenfuss Candy Company, known as Wockenfuss Candies. In 1939, Herman Lee, Herman Charles' son, graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, and enlisted in the Army. He was medically discharged due to an injury to his knee. During World War II, he remained a civilian employee of the Army, and worked at Pearl Harbor as a machinist. Herman Charles continued to operate the business until his son, Herman Lee and his wife, Marian, took over in 1945 when Herman Lee returned from World War II. Under Herman Lee's direction, the business added three more stores to its current operation on Belair Road in the Gardenville area of Baltimore, where they continued to make candies in the basement. From there, the business expanded in Maryland. Herman Lee died in 2014. Their son, Paul, is now the owner and president of Wockenfuss Candies. Under Paul's direction, the business has expanded to eight retail stores in Baltimore, Harford, Howard, and Worcester Counties.

Silentlambs' stated purpose is to help educate the public and Jehovah's Witnesses about child sexual abuse, and to assist abuse survivors who have been molested as children and silenced from speaking out or seeking proper assistance as directed by religious authority.Silentlambs' web site The group states that it has received reports from more than 5000 Jehovah's Witnesses contending that the church mishandled cases of child sexual abuse. In 2012, an attorney for the Watch Tower Society claimed that the Silentlambs website airs the personal grievances of its owner towards his former religious associates and lacks scholarly research. Founder Silentlambs was founded in 2001 by William H. Bowen, a second generation Jehovah's Witness. Bowen served as an elder for approximately 15 years, and worked in the printing factory at the headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses from 1977 until 1979. According to Bowen, he was removed as an elder in July 1992 for refusing to back down on a matter involving the appointment of a child molester. He was reappointed as an elder in 1994, but resigned the position in December 2000 over concerns about new allegations of child abuse and continued disagreement with Jehovah's Witnesses' policies for reporting child sex abuse. According to Bowen, he was disfellowshipped in 2002 for actions considered to constitute \\"causing divisions\\" and tantamount to \\"apostasy\\". Bowen claims to be an expert in comparative religions including Jehovah's Witnesses, the Catholic Church and Mormonism regarding child sex abuse policies, and provides services as a consultant for attorneys who file civil cases against Jehovah's Witnesses. He has stated that he is not an expert regarding investigations of sex abuse allegations, nor an expert regarding the historical standards of care and detection of child abuse. Bowen has self-published two books, and states that he is an expert in child custody and taxation policies of Jehovah's Witnesses. Watch Tower Society database Bowen claims that the Jehovah's Witnesses' headquarters, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, maintains a database with the names of over twenty thousand abusers; he claims the list has not been released because it would hurt the public image of the church. The Watch Tower Society states that the number of names in its records is \\"considerably lower\\", but does not specify an actual number. It stated that the purpose of the database is not to protect child molesters, but for legal reasons and to prevent molesters from being appointed in positions of authority. It also states that the number includes individuals who are not necessarily Jehovah's Witnesses, but who are \\"associated with\\" them.Fax from J. R. Brown, Office of Public Information, to Betsan Powys, dated May 9, 2002. The Watch Tower Society has acknowledged that its handling of abuse cases has not been perfect, but claims its policies were exemplary and superior to those of other religions. According to some former members, Jehovah's Witnesses may discipline or excommunicate members who have molested children, without turning the offender over to police. Lawsuits In September 2002, Bowen organized and participated in a demonstration in front of the headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York. In the spring of the same year, Silentlambs assisted in bringing the first series of major civil lawsuits against the Watch Tower Society over the mishandling of child abuse. These and other subsequent cases were settled out of court with the details kept confidential. In 2012, the Watch Tower Society's attorney stated in a court memorandum that no courts in the United States had previously found its conduct or policy regarding sex-abuse to be unlawful. The attorney also stated that the Silentlambs website is a vehicle for Bowen to \\"air his personal grievances against his former religious associates\\", and that Bowen's comments lack scholarly research and are consistently accusatory of the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses.

He held more than 100 patents.Jay O'Dell: \\"Milton Reeves was late 1800s car design pioneer\\", The Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, West Virginia, December 11, 2009 @ 12:00 AM Biography He was born on a farm in Rush County, Indiana on August 25, 1864 to William Franklin Reeves and Hannah M. Gilson and educated in Knightstown. He married Amanda Melvina Kirkpatrick in 1882. Reeves died on June 4, 1925 in Columbus, Indiana, aged 60. He was buried in Columbus City Cemetery in Columbus, Indiana.The Evening Republican, Columbus, Indiana, June 5, 1925, page 1. In 1879 Reeves worked in a sawmill in Columbus. He noticed that workers could not control the speed of the pulleys used to power the saws. This caused the wood to split and a large amount of wastage. After some months of study and experimentation, Reeves invented a variable-speed transmission to control the saws' speed.\\"A Tale of Two Brothers\\", Gas Engine Magazine In 1888 Reeves and his brothers, Marshal and Girney purchased the Edinburg Pulley Company and renamed it the Reeves Pulley Company. Marshal was the driving force behind this venture having first invented a tongueless corn plow in 1869 and in 1875 he formed the Hoosier Boy Cultivator Company with his father and uncle. In 1879 the company name was changed to Reeves & Co. Reeves, with his interest in motor vehicles, began to develop a motocycle and in so doing adapted his variable speed transmission. The transmission became a product line in its own right for the Reeves Pulley Company because of its multiple applications.Reeves Pulley Company, Historic Engineering Record In-15, National Park Service Motocycle and muffler Reeves is credited as building either the fourth or fifth American automobile, called at the time a motocycle. It had a belt and pulley based variable speed transmission which he believed made it superior to Henry Ford's Quadricycle with only one speed. The motocycle was four-wheeled and powered by a two-cylinder, two cycle, six horsepower Sintz Gas Engine Company engine. The coach was made by the Fehring Carriage Company. The Sintz engine proved unreliable and Reeves created his own air cooled model, probably in 1897/1898. His first recorded test of his motorcycle's transmission took place on September 26, 1896. To overcome noise and fumes of the engine, Reeves created a double muffler, an industry first. Reeves and his brother lodged the muffler patent in 1897. That same year he introduced a new improved version of the motocycle. The car was driven to Indianapolis and attained a top speed of 15 mph. It was reported as the first auto in the city. In a later test the vehicle attained 30 mph. By 1898, Reeves had lost momentum and was discouraged, probably by the almost complete lack of sales. Only five are thought to have been sold. By 1899 Reeves' brothers were no longer supporting the motorcycle's development mainly because of the lack of reliable engines. Reeves continued to work on developing a car and by 1904 had convinced his brothers to back another attempt. He made four Model D and six Model E cars by 1905. The D had a 12 hp engine and the E an 18-20 hp engine. In 1905 he produced an air cooled, valve in head motor with individually cast cylinders, splash lubrication, and intake and exhaust manifolds on opposite sides. That year Reeves obtained a contract for 500 of these engines from the Aerocar Company and by 1906 was making 15 engines a week. 1906 saw the introduction of a water cooled model and the Model J engined car the Reeves Go-Buggy. The Model P engine was used in the Sears Motor Buggy.http://searsmotorbuggy.com/Searsheet_Winter_2001.php The engines continued to evolve until 1910 when the family again abandoned the idea because of the collapse of the Aerocar Company.Oddballs & Oddities: And now for something completely different..., Jim Hinkley, April 2005 Through this period Reeves had continued to make cars with the Model S and N being two of the types. The variable speed transmission continued to be made by the Reeves Pulley Company up until 1955 when it was acquired by the Reliance Electric Company, now part of the Baldor Electric Company. Other auto companies using Reeves engines at various time during the period were Auburn, Autobug, Chatham, Mapleby, and Moon.G N Georgeno, The Complete Encyclcopaedia of the Motor Car - 1885 to the Present, Third Edition, 1982, Octo-Auto and Sexto- Auto Octo-Auto, Milton Othello Reeves 1911 In 1911, Reeves founded the Reeves Sexto-Octo Company. He modified a 1910 model Overland by adding four extra wheels and calling it the Reeves Octo-Auto. Time Magazine has named this car as one of the ugliest ever produced. At the time, however, the Octo-Auto was hailed by writer and editor Elbert Hubbard for its comfort and durability. It had a 40-horsepower engine, was over 20 feet long, sat 4 passengers, and retailed for $3200.00. The Octo-Auto was notable or notorious enough for Hemmings to feature it in 2011 as an April Fools' Day article on its website titled World celebrates the centennial of the Octo- Auto.http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2011/04/01/world-celebrates-the- centennial-of-the-octo-auto/ Milton Reeves driving his SextoAuto in 1912 Reeves SextoAuto 1912 The Octo-Auto failed to sell and in 1912 Reeves created the Sexto-Auto, a six-wheel version. The first version was a modification of the Octo-Auto. The second attempt was built on a modified Stutz Motor Company chassis and was no more successful than the first attempt. It was a luxury car, had variable speed transmission and reportedly made several cross-country jaunts. With a price of $4,500 (over $100,000 in 2014 terms) it too never caught on with the American public. In 1914 the Reeves Pulley Company decided to sell its engine business. The Cummings Machine Company of Minster, Ohio was its purchaser in 1918.Minnesota Valley Antique Farm Power and Machinery Association newsletter, October 2011 Buses Reeves created a bus in 1896/97 with his second motocycle called \\"The Big Seven\\" for carrying seven adults. He followed this in 1898 with a 20 passenger vehicle, which he sold to a South Dakota businessman. Unfortunately its wheels were too far apart for the wagon wheel-ruts and it was returned to the company. It was then used on the Big Four Railroad from Columbus to Hope, Indiana. His vehicles were not very successful but his variable speed transmission and muffler were. See also * Reeves & Co.

The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History In 1898, the parish of St. Stanislaus was established to relieve the overcrowding in the Polish congregation of at St. Albertus. A church and school were purchased for the parish from the Protestant Bethel Church, and in 1900 a new elementary school was constructed. Reverend F. G. Zella was assigned as the first pastor. However, between 1905-1910 the population of the church doubled, and a new church was desperately needed. In 1911, work began on a magnificent Baroque church with a lavish Beaux-Arts interior, which was completed in 1913. In 1921, a convent was built for the Felician Sisters who ran the school; seven years later, a high school was constructed. By the late 1940s, St. Stanislaus was the largest Polish parish school in Michigan. After World War II, the demographics of the neighborhood changed as the Polish Catholics moved out of the city and into the suburbs; in addition, the construction of Interstate 94 split the parish and displaced a number of families. Enrollment in the parish school declined, and the grade school was closed in 1968, the high school in 1973, and the convent demolished soon after. The parish underwent a resurgence in the late 1970s, but the 1989 reorganization of the Archdiocese of Detroit eliminated the parish. The Archdiocese sold the structure to University of Michigan organist Sam Koontz of Ann Arbor, MI in 1989. The congregation of Promise Land Missionary Baptist Church purchased the church from Koontz's estate in 1995, but lost it through foreclosure in September 2012. In January 2013, the church was for sale as-is for $79,000. It requires extensive work and several stained glass windows and other architectural elements had previously been removed. The school buildings house the Detroit Academy of Arts & Sciences and were not affected by the foreclosure and sale.

Japanese POW transport ships are usually referred to as hell ships, due to the notoriously bad conditions aboard and the many deaths that occurred on the ships. The Japanese did not mark their prisoner transports, leading to numerous casualties from friendly fire attacks. On December 27, 1944 Brazil Maru, along with Enoura Maru, were enlisted to transport the survivors from such an attack, by American forces on in Subic Bay. Although both ships had been hauling livestock, no attempt had been made to clean out the manure prior to the boarding of the prisoners, nor was any food for the prisoners loaded.

He became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Under the terms of the reforming Elementary Education Act 1870, a great number of new state- funded schools had to be built as quickly as possible, especially in the East End. Robson's experience, for which he travelled in the Continent for the most up-to-date school-planning ideas, was encapsulated in his School Architecture (1874).School Architecture; Being Practical Remarks on the Planning, Designing, Building and Furnishing of School-Houses; it was reprinted by Leicester University Press (distributed by Humanities Press, New York) 1972. For the workload, he formed a partnership with J. J. Stevenson from 1871 until 1876. The schools themselves were of brick and architectural terracotta in the many-gabled free Anglo-Flemish Renaissance style known at the time as \\"Queen Anne style\\", which Robson chose as more suitably enlightened and secular than Gothic Revival and in which Stevenson had already shown himself proficient. During his years with the School Board, Robson designed several hundred schools in London, and after leaving the Board in 1884 he remained as consulting architect to the Education Department. His early connections with the Pre-Raphaelite BrotherhoodHe commissioned a design for a watch case from Dante Gabriel Rossetti as early as 1862; it passed to his son, P.A. Robson and has been lost sight of, according to Judy Rudoe, \\"Artists' Jewellery. London, Wartski\\", The Burlington Magazine 131 No. 1032 (March 1989:235). may have made him an obvious choice in 1888 for remodelling some market buildings with great dispatch for the New Gallery, Regent Street, a venue for art of the Brotherhood and other progressive arts. Robson also built the People's Palace, Stepney (1886, now a part of Queen Mary, University of London) as well as working on new school structures, notably Primrose Hill Infants' School and the Cheltenham Ladies' College (1896) and the Jews' Free School in Spitalfields (1904). He is also credited with design of some residential houses. For example, Glenwood (99 Mycenae Road in Westcombe Park, London SE3) is described as \\"an impressive late-Victorian red brick mansion with half- timbered gable ends, and fine joinery detailing.\\"Westcombe Park Conservation Area: Character Appraisal, March 2010, Greenwich Council, p.41.

Medieval records say it was founded in the 5th century, but this is uncertain. The monastery came to an end at some time between 974 and 1178, but its church served a parish until the site was abandoned in the 15th century. Some remains of the monastery can still be seen. History The island monastery of Nendrum was traditionally founded in the 5th century by Mochaoi, after whom Mahee Island is named, although a later date for the foundation has been suggested. Mo Chaoi, like the name of many Irish saints, is a pet name. His proper name was Caolán and according to tradition he was appointed by St. Patrick.Halpin, Andrew, & Conor Newman, Ireland: An Oxford Archaeological Guide to Sites from Earliest Times to AD 1600 (Oxford University Press, 2006, , ), pp. 99-100 at books.google.comMacdonald, Philip, of Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork, Queen's University, Belfast, Monitoring at Nendrum, Mahee Island, Co.

He considers that Nendrum was early chosen as the seat of a bishop, quoting the Annals of Tigernach and the Annals of Ulster, both of which describe Cronan (died c. 640) as \\"bishop of Nendrum\\".Reeves, William, Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Down, Connor, and Dromore (1847), p. 148 online at books.google.com There are references to Nendrum in various sources, such as the Annals of the Four Masters, between the 7th century and the year 974, when the Four Masters record that \\"Sedna Ua Demain, Abbot of Nendrum, was consumed in his own house\\".Reeves, op. cit., p. 150 at books.google.com This is read as meaning that Sedna was burnt, perhaps during a Viking raid,Nendrum Monastery at theoldschoolhouseinn.com and is the last heard of Nendrum in the annals. Reeves says – The English monks were Benedictines and founded a small cell on Mahee Island. However, in 1306 Nendrum was recorded as a parish church, and during the 15th century it was abandoned for a new site at the village of Tullynakill. The location of Nendrum was then lost until it was rediscovered in 1844 by William Reeves, who visited the island searching for the church recorded in 1306 and recognized the remains of a round tower. Archaeology Since being excavated by H. C. Lawlor between 1922 and 1924, with the resulting finds now kept in the Ulster Museum, the site has been much restored. The rectangular building yielded about 30 slate tablets bearing Celtic designs. These 'trial-pieces' are now in the Ulster Museum along with a bell and a stone with an inscription in runes also from the site. Parts of the site were excavated later, by A. C. Thomas in 1954, by D. Waterman in the 1960s and by N. Brannon in 1979 and 1982. Lawlor's work was the first extensive excavation of such a large ecclesiastical site, and his technique has been criticized by modern standards, but one of the reasons for Nendrum's importance to archaeologists is that it is still the only major site of its kind which has been the subject of published excavation reports.Edwards, Nancy, The Archaeology of Early Medieval Ireland (Routledge, 2007 , ) p. 101 at books.google.com Features The principal monastic remains which can now be seen are three concentric (enclosures) of dry stone walling, but these were substantially rebuilt by Lawlor in the 1920s. The central has the round tower remains, a ruined church with a sun-dial, and a graveyard. The second contains what is called a 'monastic school' or workshop and other burials. The canonical sundial now seen at one corner of the ruined church was reconstructed from fragments found during the excavation of the site in 1924 and has been dated to about the year 900.The County Down sundial trail at sundials.co.uk One of only a few early medieval sun-dials known to exist, it takes the form of a vertical stone pillar, 190 cm high, 40 cm wide and 15 cm thick, with the dial and gnomon on one face at the top. However, because of the nature of the reconstruction, the original height of the pillar is conjectural.photograph of Nendrum Dial at flickr.com Ongoing spirituality Nendrum lies within the United Parish of Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynakill.

It was started by students at the Eichkamp International student hostel of the Free University of West Berlin. The founders of the group were law students, Detlef Girrmann and Dieter Thieme. Their original purpose was to help their fellow students, but the program later expanded to helping anybody who had hopes of escaping East Berlin. Together these two students managed to set up an evolving network that helped thousands of East Berliners safely escape. After they were banned from crossing on August 23, 1961, they used students with West Berlin or foreign passports to contact students in East Berlin and ask them if they wanted to escape.  Passports  They searched out passports from foreign embassies and private citizens that could be used to help those wishing to escape. These students faced the extreme challenge of evading the Stasi and its spies. The punishments for trying to \\"flee the republic\\" were harsh, but these students were adamant in their resolve, and exceptional at deceiving the Stasi. > It was of course not without danger for the runner, or for the potential > escaper, for if the Stasi...got wind of it, then both would be arrested and > tried, the one as the escape organizer, the other for 'fleeing the > Republic'.

They would fake the passport, and then create a history for those who would use it. The creation of a personal history was no easy task, it included hours of memorizing stories, learning phrases in their \\"native\\" languages, and general knowledge of their \\"homeland\\" in order to deceive any difficult questions border guards could ask. This method worked well until the Stasi became suspicious (or were tipped off by a spy) and border guards began inserting cards into passports for anyone who crossed over during the day.Taylor, Frederick . The Berlin Wall: A World Divided 1961-1989. London: Harper Perennial, 2006. Without one of these cards it was impossible to cross to the West side. This practice effectively stemmed the escape attempts using passports, but passports were not the only way to escape.  Sewer system  The sewer system was created before the Soviet occupation, and as such had no barriers between East and West. The first major attempt to use the sewers was not made by the Girrmann group, but instead a group of West Berlin high school seniors likewise attempting to free their school friends. After their apparent success the Girrmann group commandeered the path and refined the process with professionalism. They executed a complicated plan that included two students, Dieter Wohlfahrt and a student codenamed 'Langer' (tall in German). 'Langer' would ride a Vespa to the East, and Wohlfahrt would drive a vehicle over the top of the manhole cover (to conceal the activity below). They then together would remove the manhole cover and wait for the first groups assigned to come. After the first group entered into the sewers, 'Langer' would ride back to West Berlin and inform them that the first group was on the way. After the last group and a few extra minutes for latecomers, Wohlfahrt would close the sewer cover and drive back to West Berlin. This plan was effective, efficient, and simple. The West German senator Lipschitz provided the volunteers with the same wading boots that the Berlin department of sanitation used for working in the sewers. Like the plan with the passport, this plan ended prematurely on the fifth night of operation on October 12, 1961. Around midnight an unfamiliar vehicle raced toward the last man. The vehicle abruptly stopped and armed Vopos exited the car and began searching all of the manholes. Luckily everyone escaped without any casualties or wounds. However, the Vopos replaced the sewer covers with hacksaw-proof covers shortly after this incident.  Afterwards  The Girrmann Group faded out after the sewers, but they were possibly the most successful organization at helping East Berliners escape with roughly 5,000 reported successful attempts in 1961 alone.Heilbrunn, Jacob. \\"Exploiting a Super Power Standoff.\\" The New Leader XC.3&4 (2007): 19-21. 7 Dec. 2008 .

The text has a strong bhakti orientation, requiring daily puja to the god Vishnu. It is also known for its handling of the controversial subject of the practice of sati (the burning of a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre). A Banaras pandit, Nadapandita, was the first to write a commentary on the Vishnu Smriti in 1622, but the book was not translated into English until 1880 by Julius Jolly.Olivelle 2007: 149-150. Source, authority and dating It is commonly agreed upon that the Vishnu Smriti relies heavily on previous Dharmashastra texts, such as the Manusmriti and Yajnavalkya smrti. However, some scholars see it as a Vaishnava recast of the Kathaka Dharmasutra Jolly and Bühler make this claim but this same statement was made by their contemporaries of many other Dharmaśāstra texts, including the Manu smrti. It seems quite certain that the author of the Vishnu Smriti was a member of the Kathaka school of the Black Yajurveda in Kashmir. while others say that the Kathakagrhya and metrical verses were added later. Precise dating eludes scholars, with limits being placed anywhere between 300BCE and 1000CE.Those who argue that sutras from the Kathakagrhya and metrical verses were added later place the text's original composition at somewhere between 300BCE and 100CE, followed by a more current, edited version which appeared between 400 and 600CE. According to the latest research by Olivelle, there is reason to doubt the likelihood of repeated editing and revising.Olivelle 2007. He argues that the Vishnu Smriti is the work of a single Brahmin expert in the Dharmaśāstra tradition and also a devotee of Vishnu. Olivelle shows that the text was very likely composed between 700 and 1000CE, based on several factors: 1) the centrality of written documents and events which occurred in the Common Era being cited within the text, 2) the vocabulary used (for example, the word pustaka, which was first used by a sixth-century astronomer), 3) the fact that the Vishnu Smriti is the only Dharmaśāstra to mention satī or to deal comprehensively with tīrthas, and 4) unique iconographic correlations between descriptions of Vaishnava images in the text and specimens found only after the eighth century in Kashmir.Olivelle 2007, passim and pp. 157-159 on the iconography issue. Structure The Vishnu Smriti is divided into one hundred chapters, consisting mostly of prose text but including one or more verses at the end of each chapter. The premise of the narration is a frame story dialogue between the god Vishnu and the goddess Earth (Prithvi). This frame story remains present throughout the text, unlike many Dharmaśāstras where the simple expounding of laws takes over for the majority of the books. The text begins when Vishnu realizes that Earth is submerged underwater. He dives in to rescue her, lifting her up out of the water and exposing her surface. Earth is grateful but worries who will continue to support her in the future. Vishnu then assures her that she should not worry because, “Good people who take delight in the conduct of the social classes and the orders of life who are totally devoted to the śāstras, O Earth, will support you. The task of caring for you is entrusted to them.” (1.47). Having been comforted, the Earth continues, asking, “Tell me, O Eternal One, the Laws of the social classes and orders of life.” (1.48-1.49). From this question, Vishnu then launches into his teachings of dharma.Olivelle 2007: 155-156 Content The following is a breakdown of the subjects discussed in each of the 100 chapters of the Vishnu Smriti: :I—Vishnu and the Goddess of the Earth :II—The Four Castes :III—Duties of the King :IV—Weights and Measures :V—Criminal and Civil Law :VI—Law of Debt :VII—Writings :VIII—Witnesses :IX-XIV—Ordeals :XV-XVIII—Inheritance :XIX-XX—Funeral Ceremonies :XXI—Funeral Oblations :XXII-XXIII—Impurity :XXIV-XXVI—Women :XXVII-XXXII—Sacraments :XXXIII-XLII—Crimes :XLIII—Hells :XLIV- XLV—Transmigration :XLVI-LVII—Penances :LVIII-LXX—Duties of a Householder :LXXI—Rules for a Snātaka :LXXII—Self-restraint :LXXIII-LXXXVI—Śrāddhas :LXXXVII-XCIII—Pious Gifts :XCIV-XCV—The Hermit :XCVI—The Ascetic :XCVII—Meditation on Vishnu :XCVIII-C—Conclusion Notes References *Patrick Olivelle. \\"The Date and Provenance of the .\\" Indologica Taurinensia, 33 (2007): 149-163. *The Institutes of Visnu.

Délı̨nę means \\"where the waters flow\\", a reference to the headwaters of the Great Bear River, Sahtúdé. History On the shores of Great Bear Lake According to early records, a trading post was established in this general area as early as 1799 by the North West Company, but it did not last very many years. In 1825, Peter Warren Dease of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) erected an outpost here as the staging area and winter quarters for Sir John Franklin's second Arctic expedition of 1825–1827. It became known as Fort Franklin. Sir John Franklin's diary records that his men played ice sports very similar to what we now call hockey. As such, the modern-day town promotes itself as one of the birthplaces of the sport of ice hockey. The HBC returned and established a post called Fort Norman a short distance west, and across the lake narrows, from John Franklin's original post, between 1863 and 1869, and then relocated Fort Norman to its current location at the confluence of the Mackenzie and Bear Rivers (now Tulita).Petitot, Emile. Travels Around Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes, 1862–1882. Toronto: The Champlain Society, 2005. Fort Franklin as a modern-era trading post of the HBC was not established until later in the 19th century. It was constructed at one of the most productive Dene fisheries in the Mackenzie River drainage basin and was for the benefit of the Dene people who lived in near isolation along the shores of Great Bear Lake. The area became prominent when pitchblende was discovered at the Eldorado Mine, some away, on the eastern shore, at Port Radium. During World War II, the Canadian Government took over the mine and began to produce uranium for the then-secret American nuclear bomb project. Uranium product was transported from Port Radium by barge across Great Bear Lake where a portage network was established along the Bear River, across the bay from Fort Franklin, where many of the Dene men found work. As the risks associated with radioactive materials were not well communicated, it is believed that many of the Dene were exposed to dangerous amounts of radiation,They Never Told Us These Things which Déline residents believe resulted in the development of cancer and led to premature deaths. The name of Fort Franklin was changed on 1 June 1993 to Délı̨nę, which means \\"where the waters flow\\", a reference to the headwaters of the Great Bear River, Sahtúdé. Nearby Saoyú-ʔehdacho, the largest National Historic Site of Canada in the country, was designated in 1997 and is jointly administered by Parks Canada and the Délı̨nę First Nation. In March 2016, a tank truck fell partway through the ice road just a few days after the government had increased the allowed maximum weight limit to on the road. The truck which was outside of Délı̨nę, and close to the community's fresh water intake as well as a major fishing area, contained approximately of heating fuel and was one of 70 truck loads intended to resupply the community. The fuel was removed from the truck by 2 am, 8 March. Archaeology John Franklin's 1825-1827 outpost was excavated by the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in 1987. The excavation uncovered beads, rings, and buttons indicating the extent of trade between the Dene and Europeans. The site is protected by the Northwest Territories Archaeological Sites Regulations. In 1996, the site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Land claims and self-government Délı̨nę is represented by the Délı̨nę First Nation and belongs to the Sahtu Dene Council. Through the council, they completed negotiations with the Government of Canada for a comprehensive land claim settlement in 1993. Pursuant to the 1993 Sahtu Dene and Metis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, Délı̨nę subsequently negotiated a self-government agreement with the Government of the Northwest Territories and the Government of Canada. The Final Self-Government Agreement was ratified by a majority vote of Délı̨nę's membership in March 2014. The Final Self-Government Agreement was signed by its leadership, by the Government of the Northwest Territories and by the Government of Canada in February 2015, enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in March 2015, and enacted by the Parliament of Canada in June 2015 through Bill C-63. On September 1, 2016, the Délı̨nę Got'ı̨nę Government entered existence, legally assuming all of the responsibilities formerly held by the Délı̨nę First Nation, the Délı̨nę Land Corporation, and the Charter Community of Délı̨nę. The Final Self-Government Agreement is a Treaty within the meaning of ss. 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Through it, much of the Indian Act no longer applies to Délı̨nę's First Nations citizens. Merging a First Nations band government and a municipal government into a single authority, its structure is unique in the Northwest Territories. Demographics The population at the 2016 census was 533, an increase of 12.9% from the 2011 census.Census Profile, 2016 Census Déline, Chartered community (Census subdivision), Northwest Territories and Northwest Territories (Territory) In the 2016 Census, there were 495 Indigenous people made up of 485 First Nations, Sahtu Dene people speaking North Slavey and 10 Métis people. In 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 510, with an average yearly growth rate of -0.4% from 2006.

Life Heinrich Marx was born in Saarlouis, with the name Hirschel Levi, the son of Marx Levy Mordechai (1743–1804) and Eva Lwow (1753–1823). Heinrich Marx's father was the rabbi of Trier, a role which his older brother would later assume. Heinrich Marx qualified as a lawyer in 1814, but upon Napoleon's 1815 defeat at Waterloo, the Rhineland came into the conservative control of the Kingdom of Prussia, from its more detached French administration.Megill, Allan. Karl Marx: the burden of reason (why Marx rejected politics and the market) 2002, page 72 An 1812 edict, unenforced by the French, asserted that Jews could not occupy legal positions or state offices, and Prussian enforcement of the law led to trouble for Heinrich Marx. Marx's colleagues, including the President of the Provincial Supreme court, defended him and sought an exception for him. The Prussian Minister of Justice rejected their appeals. In 1817 or 1818, he changed his name to Heinrich Marx and converted to the state Evangelical Church of Prussia (Lutheran) to be allowed to practice law in Prussia.Frederick Betz, Societal Dynamics: Understanding Social Knowledge and Wisdom His wife and children were baptized in 1825 and 1824, respectively. After conversion 8, Simeonstrasse, Trier: Heinrich Marx's home from 1819 to his death in 1838 Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the Enlightenment, interested in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. A classical liberal, he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, then governed by an absolute monarchy.; ; . In 1815 Heinrich Marx began work as an attorney, in 1819 moving his family to a ten-room property near the Roman Porta Nigra archway.; ; . His wife, Henriette Pressburg (1788–1863), belonged to a prosperous Jewish business family from Nijmegen in the Netherlands. Henriette’s sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854), Karl Marx's aunt, married Lion Philips (1794–1866), a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and Jenny Marx would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.Francis Wheen. Karl Marx: A Life. 1999, page=246 Sophie was the grandmother of Anton and Gerard Philips who later founded the Philips Electronics company. Isaiah Berlin writes of Heinrich Marx that he believed > that man is by nature both good and rational, and that all that is needed to > ensure triumph of these qualities is the removal of artificial obstacles > from his path. They were disappearing already, and disappearing fast, and > the time was rapidly approaching when the last citadels of reaction, the > Catholic Church and the feudal nobility, would melt away before the > irresistible march of reason... Born a Jew, a citizen of inferior legal and > social status, he had attained to equality with his more enlightened > neighbours, had earned their respect as a human being, and had become > assimilated into what appeared to him as their more rational and dignified > mode of life.Isaiah Berlin, Alan Ryan. Karl Marx: his life and environment. > 1996, page 21-2 Heinrich Marx became a passionate Prussian patriot and monarchist who educated his family as liberal Lutherans.Isaiah Berlin, Alan Ryan. Karl Marx: his life and environment. 1996, page 20 He died in Trier, aged 61. Relationship with Karl Marx Heinrich had his son educated at home until the age of twelve. After graduating from the Trier Gymnasium, Karl enrolled in the University of Bonn in 1835 at the age of seventeen; he wished to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field of study. At Bonn, Karl joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (Landsmannschaft der Treveraner) and at one point served as its president. Because of Marx's poor grades, his father forced him to transfer to the far more serious and academically-oriented University of Berlin, where his legal studies became less significant than excursions into philosophy and history. Even after Karl’s move to Berlin, his parents remained concerned with his lifestyle and extravagance. After receiving a letter from Karl in November 1837, his father responded in critical fashion > Alas, your conduct has consisted merely in disorder, meandering in all the > fields of knowledge, musty traditions by sombre lamplight; degeneration in a > learned dressing gown with uncombed hair has replaced degeneration with a > beer glass. And a shirking unsociability and a refusal of all conventions > and even all respect for your father. Your intercourse with the world is > limited to your sordid room, where perhaps lie abandoned in the classical > disorder the love letters of a Jenny [Karl’s fiancée] and the tear-stained > counsels of your father. ... And do you think that here in this workshop of > senseless and aimless learning you can ripen the fruits to bring you and > your loved one happiness? ... .

Karl Marx: A Biography. 1995, pp 26-7 However, in spite of their disagreements, Karl always retained a strong affection for his father, his daughter Eleanor writing “he never tired of talking about him, and always carried an old daguerreotype photograph of him”.

History A-PAC logo used until May 2018 Former A-PAC logo On 8 December 2008 it was announced that an Australian public affairs channel called A-SPAN (an acronym for Australian Subscription Public Affairs Network) would launch on 20 January 2009. The channel format is modelled on the American public affairs network C-SPAN. The news came after reports the ABC were considering launching a dedicated public affairs digital channel. Prior to launch the channel renamed as A-PAC (an acronym for Australian Public Affairs Channel). A-PAC is a not for profit independent channel funded by Austar and Foxtel, and produced by Sky News Australia. The channel officially launched on the morning of 20 January 2009, with the inauguration of United States President Barack Obama airing on its first day, using a feed from U.S. cable channel C-SPAN. Despite originally planned to occur on 26 April 2009, on 17 May 2009 A-PAC began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, along with sister channels Sky News Business Channel and Sky News Australia. On 24 May 2012, Foxtel acquired Austar, which saw Foxtel become the sole stakeholder of A-PAC. In February 2014, A-PAC had an on-air refresh, as well as launched a revamped website and a new weekly newsletter. In addition, Sky News presenter Helen Dalley was appointed as channel host. In May 2018, A-PAC was rebranded to Sky News Extra and moved to channel 604 on Foxtel. The name and channel number change reflect on the additional programming it will have and to be in line with the other Sky News channels. In March 2020, the channel was temporarily rebranded as Sky News COVID-19, as part of the networks' extended coverage of the ongoing 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic in Australia. The channel currently features a combination of live and pre-recorded news bulletins, press conferences and segments relating to COVID-19 across the nation.https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/every- breaking-detail-peter-stefanovic-laura-jayes-front-new-sky-news- covid19-channel/news-story/6a4132504e644fe6ebe010ca53a13d67 Programming Sky News Extra content features live broadcasts from Australia's Parliament House in Canberra (including sittings of the House of Representatives, the Senate, parliamentary Committee meetings and political press conferences), the parliaments of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland as well as sittings of the United States Congress, live broadcasts of speeches from the Australian National Press Club and a program which provides coverage of the New Zealand and British parliaments. Material from the United Nations and the European Parliament is also aired. Availability At launch A-PAC was available via satellite and cable television on channel 607; and was later made available by Internet streaming on its website, as well as on free-to-air digital television in Sydney as a trial. On 15 November 2009, A-PAC's channel location for Foxtel changed from Channel 607 to Channel 648. From 1 May 2016, the service's linear channel was replaced by Sky News Election Channel, resulting in the service only being available on the Sky News Multiview service and online. Although the service was originally planned to relaunch as a linear channel on 30 November 2016, this was later postponed, and ultimately the linear channel did not return until 24 January 2017. The relaunch did, however, see A-PAC obtain Sky News Election Channel's HD feed, seeing the channel available in high definition for the first time.

Only ten were built in this configuration. Operational history The Express 37 finished first, second and third in its debut at the 1985 Transpacific Yacht Race. In a 2005 used boat review in Sailing Magazine, writer John Kretschmer concluded of the design, \\"The Express 37 offers exhilarating performance both on and off the racecourse. And although one-design fleets are shrinking, most 37s have a lot of speed left in them. Also, following the trend of their boats, as racing sailors get older and migrate toward more casual sailing, a logical decision might be to convert a 37 into more of a cruising boat.\\" Marine surveyor and naval architect, Jack Hornor described the design in a 2007 review, \\"the Express 37 will appeal to sailors interested in racing more than the dedicated cruiser; although, there is no reason these mid-1980s models can’t serve double duty for prospective buyers looking for a reasonably priced, solidly constructed racer/cruiser...Although contemporary in appearance, Schumacher’s respect for the beauty of traditional, well balanced boats is apparent in this design.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Express 27 *Express 34 Similar sailboats *Alberg 37 *Baltic 37 *C&C; 37 *Dickerson 37 *Dockrell 37 *Endeavour 37 *Hunter 36-2 *Tayana 37 References Sailing yachts 1980s sailboat type designs Keelboats ","title":"Express 37"},{"id":"20588769","text":"The Battle of Shantou (a treaty port long romanised as Swatow) occurred in SeptemberOctober 1927 during the first phase of the Chinese Civil War in China.

RPX promises to never assert or litigate the patents in its portfolio. Business RPX's service is designed to mitigate members' litigation risk and costs from NPEs by purchasing patents and patent rights before patents are asserted, or to resolve an ongoing litigation.

In a narrower sense, myelopoiesis also refers specifically to the regulated formation of myeloid leukocytes (myelocytes), including eosinophilic granulocytes, basophilic granulocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes, and monocytes. The common myeloid progenitor can differentiate in the bone marrow into red blood cells and megakaryocytes (leading to platelets) as well as mast cells and myeloblasts, the latter leading to the myelocytic line (granulocytes) and to monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells of the innate immune system. The granulocytes, also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes because of their multilobed nuclei, are three short lived cell types including eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils. A granulocyte differentiates into a distinct cell type by a process called granulopoiesis. In this process it first transforms from a common myeloblast (myeloid progenitor) to a common promyelocyte. This promyelocyte gives rise to a unique myelocyte that for the first time can be classified as an eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil progenitor based on the histological staining affinity (eosinophilic, basophilic, or neutral granules).Junqueira, Carneiro. Basic Histology, Text and Atlas.McGraw-Hill Companies. 2005. The unique myelocyte next differentiates into a metamyelocyte and then a band cell, with a \\"C\\" shaped nucleus, before becoming a mature eosinophil, basophil, or neutrophil. Macrophages come from monoblast progenitors that differentiate into promonocytes, which mature into monocytes. Monocytes eventually enter the tissues and become macrophages.

It measures roughly 110,000 light- years across; about the same as our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Its shape is classified as \\"SA(s)cd,\\" meaning that it is unbarred and has several rather loosely wound spiral arms. The large numbers of bright bluish knots are active star-forming regions where some very luminous and young stars can be perceived. Because NGC 6118 has loosely wound spiral open arms, no clear defined spiral arms like the Milky Way galaxy and lacks a central bar, the galaxy thus does not have a galactic habitable zone like the Milky Way.Universe Today, Supernova in a Distant Galaxy NGC 6118, 24 Mar , 2012, by Fraser CainAstro Photo Lab, The Blinking Galaxy For the Milky Way, the galactic habitable zone is commonly believed to be an annulus with an outer radius of about 10 kiloparsecs and an inner radius close to the Galactic Center, both of which lack hard boundaries. NGC 6118 is difficult to see with a small telescope. Amateur astronomers have nicknamed it the \\"Blinking Galaxy\\", as it has a tendency to flick in and out of view with different eye positions.  Supernova 2004dk  SN 2004dk was first reported by James Graham and Weidong Li on 1 August 2004. They found the new supernova by studying images produced by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) program with the 76 cm Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) in San Jose, CA. SN 2004dk was initially classified by European Southern Observatory astronomer Fernando Patat et al. on 4 Aug 2004 as a Type Ic supernova. Type Ib and Ic supernovae are the end result of massive stars (> 8 solar masses) that have run out of nuclear fuel. Normally one would expect to see evidence of hydrogen and helium, but when these supernova occur in a binary system the companion has sometimes gravitationally stripped the outer layers of the progenitor star away, leaving only the heavier elements. Type Ib supernovae have no hydrogen, while Type Ics have neither hydrogen or helium. Over the following weeks Alexei Filippenko et al. and the University of California at Berkeley discovered prominent He I absorption lines, thus changing the classification of the supernova to Type Ib.

It is composed of two short works, \\"How I Became a Philosopher\\", and \\"To Love, To Love Me, To Love Us: From September 11 to April 21\\", which were published separately in French in 2003 as Passer à l'acte and Aimer, s'aimer, nous aimer: Du 11 septembre au 21 avril. Acting Out was published by Stanford University Press in 2009, and the translators were David Barison, Daniel Ross, and Patrick Crogan.  How I Became a Philosopher  This section of the work was originally delivered as an oral presentation, a kind of \\"confession\\" à la Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in which Stiegler admits for the first time that he became a philosopher while incarcerated for a period of five years. Stiegler tells the story of his transformation in prison, a transformation which took the form of rediscovering the world in a quasi-phenomenological fashion. The chapter draws from the work of Edmund Husserl, Aristotle, and Epictetus.  To Love, To Love Me, To Love Us: From September 11 to April 21  This section of the work is a discussion of the ways in which modern society is leading to a loss of a sense of existence, thus a destruction of what Stiegler calls \\"primordial narcissism\\", resulting in the proliferation of all kinds of individual and collective pathological behaviours. He outlines his theory of individuation (drawn in part from the work of Gilbert Simondon), and the compositional relation of synchronic and diachronic processes, in order to argue that a consumer society founded on television advertising produces hyper-synchronising and hyper-diachronising processes which threaten human desire and therefore human existence. Examples discussed of the consequences of these processes include the September 11, 2001 attacks, the success of the French National Front, and the Nanterre massacre perpetrated by Richard Durn.

Milton enjoyed little wide-scale early success, either in prose or poetry, until the production of his later, controversial political works starting with The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates and Eikonoklastes. Political works Although Milton was known early on for a poem that he wrote about Shakespeare and for his masque Comus, he was only a minor figure until he started writing in a pamphlet war. By 1654, Milton was involved in public controversies, thinking that he could help the English people by using his writings to promote his political beliefs.Wheeler 2003 pp. 263–264 His writing brought him into a position of power in the Commonwealth, Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Council of State, and he served in that duty from 1649 until 1659.Shawcross 1993 p. 233 His controversial works, starting with The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates and Eikonoklastes, were able to appeal to a larger audience than many of Milton's previous works, and, in turn, they sold well even though the content of the works were not received positively.Von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239 =Antiprelatical tracts= The antiprelatical tracts were written just after the Bishops' Wars of 1639 and 1640. Milton joined the antiprelatical factions opposing the policies of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the policies of the Church of England. The antiprelatical factions fell into a pamphlet war with those supporting the Anglican church structure.Wheeler 2003 p. 265 Through his various arguments, Milton connects the structure of church government and government in general while relying on scripture to serve as an authority for his arguments.Dzelzainis 2003 p. 298 =Areopagitica= Areopagitica was published at the height of the English Civil War. Milton argued forcefully against the Licensing Order of 1643 and he relies on biblical and classical references to strengthen his argument. The main focus of the piece is to attack traditionalists and complacent people who are afraid of change and debate.Keeble 2003 p. 136 In the piece, Milton suggests that Christians experience purification when they are tested by new ideas and not harmed by them.Lares 2001 p. 96 Ironically though, the book was banned in England not long after publication. =The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates= Milton wrote The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates as a justification to Parliament's execution of Charles I.Dzelzainis 2003 p. 296 The work was controversial but popular, and it went into many five editions during the 17th century.Shawcross 1993 p. 105 In it, he becomes the first European to posit a republic is the only acceptable form of government, and the first to argue that monarchy is an unacceptable form of government. (Nelson, Eric \\"Talmudical Commonwealthsmen and the Rise of Republican Exclusivism, The Historical Journal, 50, 4 (2007), pp. 809–835) =Eikonoklastes= Milton was commissioned to write Eikonoklastes as a response to Charles I's Eikon Basilike (1649). Eikon Basilike was published just after Charles I execution, and the work portrayed Charles I as a martyr. In Eikonoklastes, Milton tried to systematically critique each point in Eikon BasilikeDobranski 1999 p. 15 Throughout the work Milton believed that Charles I's work created a false idol, and he wanted to destroy it with truth.Raymond 2003 p. 206 He also claimed that all monarchs have the potential to be tyrants, no matter how benevolent they may appear.Dzelzainis 2003 p. 307 =Defensio pro Populo Anglicano= The Defensio pro Populo Anglicano was a tract commissioned by Parliament to respond to Claudius Salmasius's defence of Charles I. =Defensio Secunda= Milton was commissioned to write Defensio Secunda as a defence of the Parliamentary regime, controlled by Cromwell, who sought to win the support of a European audience.Wootton 1994 p. 75 The work was also a response to attacks on Defensio pro Populo Anglicano by Salmasius.Rumrich 2003 p. 154 The work was one of the last times that Milton ever discussed Cromwell's character.Keeble 2003 p. 134 =A Treatise of Civil Power= Milton wrote A Treatise of Civil Power to warn against claims of heresy and of attempts to limit free speech in regards to religious matters. He addresses the tract to Cromwell and Parliament to encourage them to prevent such disregards for personal liberty.Shawcross 1993 p. 172 =The Ready and Easy Way= The Ready and Easy Way was written by Milton during the final moments of the Commonwealth and sought to promote his views on the establishment and constitution of an English Republic. His opinion was ignored, and the English Restoration soon after took place, heralding a form of monarchical government opposite in tendency to what Milton desired.Rumrich 2003 pp. 154–155 = Paradise Lost = Milton’s politics also revealed themselves in his fictional works. For instance, scholars have argued that Paradise Lost was informed in part by contemporaneous comic broadsides like The Life and Death of Mris. Rump.Warren, Christopher (2016). “To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.” Law, Culture and the Humanities. Such broadsides had a political agenda: in this case, persuading Presbyterians to assent to a restoration of the monarchy.Hughes, Anne (2012). Gender and the English Revolution. Routledge.Raymond, Joad (2001). “The Literature of Controversy,” in A Companion to Milton. Ed. Thomas N. Corns. Blackwell. P. 20 As Christopher N. Warren has argued, “For a republican independent like Milton observing these gestures, it was vital to demonstrate that the Presbyterians could not trust the promises of safety implied by the royalist allegories.”Warren, Christopher (2016). “To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.” Law, Culture and the Humanities. p. 19. Paradise Lost’s Sin and Death allegory speaks to this concern by forestalling “comic reconciliation,” urging the reader to recall England’s violent political past, rather than “forgetting or sanitizing” the past in the move towards reconciliation.Warren, Christopher (2016). “To Ruin the Repairs: Milton, Allegory, Transitional Justice.” Law, Culture and the Humanities. p. 10, 19. Views =Government= Milton supported a republican form of government. In 1649, Milton wrote The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates expressing his support of a republican form of government. English republicanism grew during the English Civil War after the royalist forces were defeated at Worcester during September 1651.Worden 1990 p. 226 When the Rump Parliament was removed and Oliver Cromwell became the Protector in December 1653, Milton, and other republicans, believed that the Commonwealth was not following the proper governmental path. The republicans no longer felt obliged to criticise the Stuart monarchy after it had fallen. Instead, they tried to convince the new government, under Cromwell, to adopt republican principles.Dzelzainis 2003 p. 295 Republicanism picked up greater momentum when a series of anti-Cromwell works were published in 1656. The English republican movement, however, was not united: the so-called \\"commonweathmen\\" held to the idea that the dissolution of the Rump had been illegal. Although Milton believed in their abstract ideas, he produced some works that defended the existing form of government under the Protectorate. Even in The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, Milton wrote that people needed to supportDzelzainis 2003 p. 295–196 \\"the present Parlament & Army\\".Milton 1962 p. 194 His republicanism was put aside to support the government, and, in Defensio Secunda, he praised Cromwell's rule.Worden 1998 pp. 243–264 Once Cromwell died and the Commonwealth fell apart, Milton returned to his republican principles, and he published several works in opposition to a monarchical form of government. =Licensing= Milton attacks the concept of licensing and promotes the need for debate and discussion in his Areopagitica. He believed that the government should not censor works because the search for truth and understanding is an ongoing process and must be open. The search for truth, according to Milton, is a continual process, and an individual can never attain truth if the expression of some views is prohibited by licensing laws. Milton's involvement with the licensing controversy proved to be important, and his ideas influenced later discussions of truth and the freedom of printing.Shawcross 1993 pp. 104–105 yo mama yo mamamamama Notes References * Dobranski, Stephen. \\"Milton's social life\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Milton.

It consists of a chapel, stations of the cross, and replicas of catacombs and Israelite villages constructed from cinder blocks, bathtubs, and other discards. The park closed to the public in 1984 and was vandalised. But on September 14, 2014, the site reopened to the public for the first time in 30 years with an inaugural Mass and access to the grounds. The area is open to the general public during daylight hours. Creation and peak years Holy Land USA was conceived by John Baptist Greco, a Waterbury-based attorney. Greco, a Roman Catholic, founded a volunteer organization called Companions of Christ, with the purpose of creating an attraction that would replicate Bethlehem and Jerusalem of the Biblical era. Construction commenced in 1955. Bob Chinn, the grounds chairman at Holy Land USA, recalled Greco's mission in a 2001 interview with The New York Times: \\"He was a very spiritual man. He wanted to do this for the people of the community. He felt no one, no matter the race, creed or color, should be separated. He wanted a place for all people to sit and be peaceful.\\" Among the attractions at the site were a recreation of the Garden of Eden, a diorama depicting Daniel in the lions' den, and various recreations of the life and ministry of Jesus. The centerpiece of the site was a cross and an illuminated sign that read \\"Holy Land USA\\". During its peak years in the 1960s and 1970s, Holy Land USA attracted upwards of 40,000 visitors annually. Greco closed Holy Land USA in 1984, with plans to improve and expand the site. But the work was left unfinished when Greco died in 1986. The property was left to the Filippini Sisters. Closure and Notable Events The stainless steel cross erected in 2008. The floodlights that illuminate the cross at night are visible. The Stainless Steel cross was removed in 2013 to make way for a new and larger lighted cross. Since its closure, Holy Land USA had fallen into a state of advanced disrepair. Although it was not open to the public, the site continued to attract attention. In 2002, the Waterbury Region Convention and Visitors Bureau received more than 150 calls a year for directions to the site. The web site Roadside America has included it in its coverage of offbeat attractions, albeit with the cautionary note that visitors should \\"explore with caution (and with an up-to-date tetanus shot).\\" Many attractions and statues at the site had either been vandalized or otherwise fallen into disrepair. There was ongoing debate about the site's future. It was suggested that the park be preserved as folk art, and there were numerous failed attempts to restore the park, including one involving the Knights of Columbus in 2000. The Religious Sisters of Filippi Greco were accused of fearing \\"liability and being sued\\" and thereby turning away volunteers and stopping restoration efforts, but they also received support from those who believed that, although accepting the park reluctantly, they had been \\"good stewards\\" over it. The Sisters held weekly prayer meetings at the site, and the holy hours on Sundays were devoted to the Virgin of Revelation, an apparition of the Virgin Mary witnessed in 1947 by an Italian on his way to assassinate Pope Pius XII in Rome. The Sisters claim the statue of the Madonna in the chapel is one of three commissioned by Pope John Paul II. Despite the lack of full restoration, some renovation projects were undertaken while the park was closed. In 1997 a group of Boy Scouts repaired the illuminated \\"Holy Land USA\\" sign as part of a community service project, and in 2008 the original 56-foot cross was replaced with a stainless steel one, which was dedicated in a ceremony led by Archbishop Henry J. Mansell. In response to community outcry a new LED illuminated cross was installed in 2013. The new cross, funded by community donations and with work donated by local construction companies, is a steel structure that stands 65 feet high and 26 feet wide. The state of the art LED lighting system allows the cross to change color based on the Roman Catholic Liturgical colors. On 11 August 2018, Archbishop Leonard Paul Blair of the Archdiocese of Hartford celebrated a Mass at the park honoring the legacy of Father Michael McGivney, who is under Vatican consideration for sainthood. McGinvney was the founder of the Knights of Columbus.http://www.courant.com/community/plainville/hc-news-waterbury-holy- land-20180807-story.html Revival On June 20, 2013, Mayor Neil O'Leary and car dealer Fred \\"Fritz\\" Blasius purchased Holy Land from the Filippini Sisters for $350,000, announcing a plan to clean up and revitalise the site as part of a community effort. The plan included the installation of a new and larger lighted cross on the property. On December 22, 2013, the new cross was illuminated. Since the revival of the cross, the once-overgrown land has been cleared of trees and underbrush. Smaller projects have been put in place to refurbish small areas of the property.

It offers a broad range of instruction in areas of American song, jazz and gospel singing, Latin jazz, and African drumming. The conservatory was founded in 1897 by German-American immigrants as a classical European conservatory. The conservatory was initially located at Franklin Avenue and Lefferts Place. In 1944 it moved to occupy an 1881 five-story mansion at 58 Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, which had been built in 1881 as the residence of M. Brasher, and subsequently became the Park Slope Masonic Club. The building was designed by S. F. Evelette in the Victorian Gothic style, with Queen Anne elements. It is located in the Park Slope Historic District. The Conservatory operates four divisions catering to 7,500 full and part-time students. It hosts over 200 community events each year including singalongs, recitals, dance parties, curated concert series, performances, workshops and festivals. The Conservatory is a 501(c)(3). Operating funds come from earned revenue and donations made by individual donors, corporations, foundations and government entities. Community Music School 800 students participate in weekly private lessons or group classes in every major musical instrument at the Conservatory's Park Slope headquarters. The Community Music School encompasses the Conservatory's 22 ensembles and chamber groups, including the Brooklyn Conservatory Community Orchestra (BCCO) and the Brooklyn Conservatory Chorale (BCO), as well its early childhood and summer programs.> Suzuki Program The Suzuki program at the Conservatory offers programs in violin, viola, cello, guitar, piano, bass and flute. Children ages 3.5 and up are eligible to participate. 240 students, ages 3–18 enroll each year. Music Therapy In 2003, the Music Therapy program was established to address the developmental, emotional, psychological and social needs of children and adults through active music-making in a relationship with a master's and doctoral degree level, certified music therapists. This program serves 1,600 clients citywide at 42 sites. Music Partners Music Partners was created in 1988 in response to a critical need in New York City — the rising number of public schools offering no music instruction. It now serves over 5,000 students —two thirds living at or below the poverty line— at 30 sites across the city, making Music Partners the largest off-site music program of any community music school in New York City.

All these names are largely interchangeable, cf. Michael W. Herren (2000), \\"Some Quantitative Poems Attributed to Columbanus of Bobbio,\\" Poetry and Philosophy in the Middle Ages: A Festschrift for Peter Dronke (Leiden: E. J. Brill, ), 111 n54.

Herren, 111. was a Hiberno-Latin author associated with the Carolingian Renaissance. His poetry is full of classical allusions and quotations of Virgil.His poems are translated by Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 278-81. He may have been a cleric at Rome, as the manuscript which nicknames him states; there were several such Colmans at Rome in the ninth century. He may be one of those responsible for spreading the cult of Saint Brigid in Italy. One manuscript suggests he was a bishop.MS BN lat. 18095, where his poem is titled \\"Versus Colmani episcopi de sancta Brigida\\" (Verses of bishop Colman of saint Brigid). Connections with Bobbio On the basis of similarity in prosody, he has also been identified as the composer of certain poems traditionally assigned to Columban, the saint and founder of Bobbio Abbey.However, Colman refers to himself as \\"Colman\\" in his poems, Columban as \\"Columban\\" (Herren, 111). These are Columbanus Fidolio, Ad Hunaldum, Ad Sethum, Praecepta vivendi, and the celeuma. Since the former was in manuscript by c.790 and the latter was probably used by Paul the Deacon (d.c.800), their poet's dates are set to the late eighth century.Though he may have written much earlier, or even be Columban (Herren, 112). It is possible that Colman was merely the imitator of Columban. He would certainly have had access to the latter's works if he lived in Italy.Herren, 113. There survives a notice of some books gifted by a priest named Theodore to Bobbio (Breve de libris Theodori Presbyteri) that lists: Martyrologium Hieronymi, et de arithmetica Macrobii, Dionisii, Anatolii, Victorii, Bedae, Colmani, et epistolae aliorum sapientum liber i. Whether the Colman is the poet \\"nepos Cracavist\\" or another is unknown, likewise are the books of his donated.Esposito, 119, hypothesises a Epistola Colmani de arithmetica, but notes that it may be a reference to the Historia Ecclesiastica of Bede, which deals with a dispute involving Colman of Lindisfarne at the Synod of Whitby in 664. This notice was first printed by L. A. Muratori (1740) in his Antiquitates Italicae Medii Aevi, iii, col. 822. Poem of Saint Brigid Colman wrote a 34-hexameter lyrical vignette which is the earliest poem about Saint Brigid, incipit Quodam forte die caelo dum turbidus imber (\\"One day, when a rain-storm happened to be raging in the heavens\\").Godman, 278. It survives in two manuscripts now at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. The better reading is in BN lat. 18095, where his poem is titled \\"Versus Colmani episcopi de sancta Brigida\\" (Verses of bishop Colman of saint Brigid). This manuscript, place of origin unknown, was for some time in Notre-Dame-de- Paris.It is written in Caroline minuscule with no trace of Irish influence, though its miscellaneous contents include Irish works, cf. Esposito, 114. The other, BN nouv. acq. lat. 1615, a ninth-century manuscript from Saint-Benoît- sur-Loire called the Liber sancti Benedicti Floriacensis, is a compilation of astronomy in which Colman's verses are found under the rubric \\"Colmanus nepos Cracavist in Roma virtutem hanc sanctae Brigitę praedicavi\\" in a section titled \\"De peritia cursus lunae et maris\\".This compilation betrays Irish sources, but the MS is continental, cf. Esposito, 113. In the composition of his vignette, Colman relied on the prose sources Cogitosus and the Vita Brigidae prima, as can be seen from his conflation of their accounts of Brigid's hanging her robe from a sunbeam: Cogitosus says as if from beam, the Vita as if on a rope. Colman uses both similes to describe the miracle. The poem may have been designed for use by a biographer composing a vita of Brigid. Envoi to Colman Colman also wrote a short farewell poem to a fellow Irishman, also named Colman, who was returning to Ireland.Incipit: Dum subito properas dulces invisere terras, \\"Since you are in haste all of a sudden to visit those sweet lands\\" (Godman, 280). He himself wrote the title for the piece in two hexameters: Colmano versus in Colmanum perheriles / Scottigena ficti patriae cupidum et remeantem.This title appears only in the Reims MS; the Saint-Benoît scribe changed it to Colmano Scottigena versus in Colmanum ficti: \\"to Colman the Irish-born a poem made by Colman\\". Cf. Esposito, 119. Colman expresses regret that he will be left behind, but the poem is absent the personal pleading and admonition typical of its genre (and exemplified by fellow Carolingian poets Walahfrid Strabo and Gottschalk of Orbais).Godman, 280. Colman speaks of himself as an old man at the time of this writing, though his countryman is young. This poem is found alongside the Brigid piece in the manuscript known as BN nouv. acq. lat. 1615 and also in Reg. 15 B. xix in the British Museum, London. This last manuscript was written at Reims in the ninth century and was for a long time MS no. CCV at the Abbey of Saint-Remi.Esposito, 116.

Gummi bears and Jelly Babies are widely popular and are a well-known part of the sweets industry. Gummies are available in a wide variety of shapes, most commonly colourful depictions of living things such as bears, babies, or worms. Various brands such as Bassett's, Haribo, Betty Crocker, Disney and Kellogg's manufacture various forms of Gummi snacks, often targeted at young children. The name \\"gummi\\" originated in Germany, with the term \\"jelly\\" more common in British-English.  History  Gummies have a long history as a popular confectionery. The first gelatin based shaped candy was the Unclaimed Babies, sold by Fryers of Lancashire in 1864.  Ingredients  Gummy candies are made mostly of corn syrup, sucrose, gelatin, starch and water. In addition, minor amounts of coloring and flavoring agents are used. Food acids such as citric acid and malic acid are also added in order to give a tart flavor to gummies. It is often that other gelling agents are used in place of gelatin to make gummy candies such as starch and pectin.  Types of gummies  Fruit flavored gumdrops Jelly bean =Babies= The Jelly Babies gum candy was the first commercially available shaped gum candy. It originated in the United Kingdom. They were first produced by Fryers of Lancashire in 1864 and sold as \\"Unclaimed Babies\\". By 1918 they were (and still are) produced by Basset's in Sheffield as Jelly Babies. =Bears= Haribo gummy bears were first made in Germany. The gummi bear originated in Germany, where it is popular under the name Gummibär (rubber bear) or Gummibärchen (little rubber bear). Hans Riegel Sr., a maker from Bonn, produced these sweets under the Haribo company, which he started in 1920. =Bottles= A cola bottle gummi, alongside a gummi hot dog, pizza, hamburger, and box of fries. Cola bottles are sweets in the shape of classic Coca-Cola-style bottles with a cola flavor. They are produced by numerous companies. \\"Fizzy Blue Bottles\\", made by Lutti (formerly part of the French division of the Leaf Company, now controlled by a private investment group), are sweets typically found in a pick and mix selection. These are very similar to cola bottle gummies in shape, but they are usually sour and coloured blue and pink. \\"Blue Bottles\\", a variation from another company, are identifiable by the small rims around the sides, and are chewier and thicker, with a sweeter taste. =Rings= Ring- shaped gummi is often covered in sugar or sour powder. The most common and popular flavor is the peach ring. Other flavors include green apple, melon, blue raspberry, strawberry, and aniseed - although these are typically coated in chocolate. A commonly known producer of gummi rings is Trolli, for which the gummi rings are an important asset. =Red frogs= In Australia, jelly confectionery in the shape of frogs has been very popular since the 1930s. They are colored red or green, although they are usually referred to as \\"red frogs\\". These have influenced the shape, structure, consistency and formula that makes gummy bears. Red frog gummies are not associated with the Red Frogs Association. =Road kill gummies= In February 2005, following complaints by the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Kraft decided to stop production of the controversial Trolli U.S. Road Kill Gummies. The society complained that the products, shaped as partly flattened squirrels, chickens and snakes, would give children an incorrect message on the proper treatment of animals. =Teeth gummies= In Australia, jelly confectionery in the shape of teeth has been very popular since the 1930s. They are colored pink and white, with pink representing the gums and teeth being white. They have a slight minty flavor, similar to mint toothpaste. =Worm gummies= There are many types of Gummy Worms, and Trolli produces glow worm gummies, with glowing color and sour sugar. = Shark gummies = There are also many types of gummy sharks but the blue and white ones are the most popular. = Vitamin gummies = There are also several multi-vitamin gummi bears, usually marketed for children, such as Flintstones Chewable Vitamins. These form of vitamins give off nutrients and protein for those that do not swallow pills or need various supplements to stay healthy.  Health considerations  Gummies landed on the \\"What's out in 2009\\" list for some Canadian schools, along with chocolate, fudge, chocolate coated nuts and fruit, bubble gum, lollipops, toffee, jelly beans, marshmallows, sherbet, and Turkish delight. An audit in Victoria, British Columbia, was planned for 2009 to ensure the government banned the selling of the confectionery treat in school stores and vending machines as directed. Scientists have studied adding the tooth-protecting sugar substitute xylitol to gummies to fight tooth decay. Choking risks are higher with gummi candies; research shows that \\"hard, round foods with high elasticity or lubricity properties, or both, pose a significant level of risk,\\" especially to children under three years of age.http://www.ijporlonline.com/article/S0165-5876%2808%2900129-8/abstract This can be resolved with the Heimlich maneuver.  Storage  Storage of gummy candies in conditions of high humidity will result in the moisture migration of water molecules from the surrounding environment into the candy. If gummy candies are exposed to an environment that is high in moisture content, it is likely that moisture will permeate the candy and increase its relative moisture content. An increase of the candies moisture content will increase the molecular mobility of particles in the candy, leading to a variety of unwanted outcomes such as: * Sucrose crystallization and subsequent grainy texture. * A sticky candy surface. * Diffusion of flavors out of the candy. * Possibility of Microbial growth. Moisture migration of gummy candies can be prevented by storing candies in conditions where the surrounding environment is equal to their own moisture content.

Reception  Objectivist scholar Tara Smith reviewed the work for the Review of Metaphysics and described it as \\"an admirably essentialized review\\" that \\"joins scholarly rigor with firsthand knowledge of Rand’s thought to provide a systematic introduction to Rand’s philosophy.\\" Smith does find some of Gotthelf's explanations to be \\"slightly too abbreviated for the targeted audience\\" and finds his brief treatment of some topics to be \\"somewhat frustrating.\\" In a review in Teaching Philosophy, Irfan Khawaja says, \\"Gotthelf’s illuminating account of Rand’s epistemology offers an intriguing point of entry... as well as an object lesson on the relationship between epistemology and ethics... On Ayn Rand is a remarkable success... I can’t think of a piece of writing that better conveys both the systematicity and the grandeur of Rand’s thought than the last four pages of Gotthelf’s book.\\" Rand enthusiast and accountancy scholar Edward W. Younkins also praised the work, calling it a \\"fine\\" but shorter version of Objectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff's book about Rand's philosophy. In a review, Rand scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra welcomes the addition of another book to the literature about Rand, but criticizes Gotthelf for not addressing most other secondary works about Rand, in particular accusing him of \\"refusal to mention any non-orthodox works.\\" Sciabarra says the book suffers from an \\"orthodox interpretation\\" of Rand's life and ideas, and also gives insufficient attention to her politics and aesthetics. In a paper on the critical neglect of Rand's aesthetic philosophy, Michelle Marder Kamhi and Louis Torres criticized Gotthelf for spending a mere half a page of the book discussing the topic. Kamhi and Torres also criticised Gotthelf's statement that one's sense of life is directly dependent on philosophy (in contrast to Rand), and his uncritical acceptance of Rand's definition of romantic art in terms of the acceptance of man's free will.

New York Times 29 July 2007. Retrieved 10 July 2011. Biography =Early life and education= Leon Ichaso was born in Havana August 3, 1948, into a family of well-known writers, journalists and artists. His father, Justo Rodríguez Santos, was one of Cuba's most respected poets and a pioneer in broadcast TV and radio -and his mother Antonia Ichaso had a radio magazine show in the 1940s. Ichaso left the island for exile in Mexico and the United States, with his mother Antonia Ichaso and sister Mari Rodriguez Ichaso, at age 14. His father stayed behind to continue his unwavering support for the Cuban Revolution. Five years later he joined his family in New York. =Career= Leon Ichaso is known as a director who specializes in gritty urban realism. He first made his mark with the independently made Spanish-language feature, El Super (1979), based on an Off- Broadway play about an immigrant building superintendent trying to make his way in New York City. It took six years for the filmmaker to follow up on this study, but Crossover Dreams (1985), was a fine first shot at a somewhat more mainstream film. The film was a hard-hitting look at different but mixed US Latino communities, life in the barrio and the potent drive of salsa music. Imported into the Hollywood scene, Ichaso found his talent for telling tough stories of the big city slotted into action series on TV (e.g., Miami Vice, Crime Story, The Equalizer) and TV movies as The Fear Inside, The Take, A Table at Ciro's and A Kiss to Die For. Ichaso later directed Wesley Snipes's Sugar Hill (1993), a character study wedded to a violent crime drama of a New York drug empire. In the Dominican Republic and Cuba in 1996, Ichaso made Azúcar Amarga (Bitter Sugar), a Spanish language film about a disillusioned Cuban Communist. For the next several years, Ichaso worked in several TV- movies, some of which were adaptations of acclaimed plays. Zooman (Showtime, 1995) was an adaptation of an Off-Broadway play dealing with a family coping with the murder of child. Execution of Justice (Showtime, 1999) was also derived from a Broadway play that detailed the events behind the murders of San Francisco mayor George Moscone and supervisor Harvey Milk. While told from the point of view of the assassin, Dan White, Ichaso's film remained neutral and demonstrated that the questions surrounding a highly charged event could not be reduced to simple answers. Ichaso next tackled a pair of small screen biographies Ali: An American Hero (Fox, 2000) and Hendrix (Showtime, 2000). He later wrote and directed the highly acclaimed biographical feature Piñero (2001), about the life of Puerto Rican author Miguel Piñero, who had the soul of a poet but lived the life of a thief. Ichaso employed a collage-like approach to the author's life, including flashbacks, drug-induced dreams and scenes from stage performances to create a portrait of an intriguing, if difficult, person. After working again for Showtime (Sleeper Cell, 2005), Cane, The Cleaner (A&E;), Persons Unknown (Fox/Televisa 2008 and 2009), developing his own future projects (\\"Monk\\"), and teaching movie directing in France, in 2004, Ichaso started working on the screenplay of salsa singer Héctor Lavoe's biography, El Cantante. This was shot in 2006 and stars Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. His last movie Paraiso, filmed in Miami in 2008, opened during the 2009 Miami International Film Festival in March 2009.

The Roman Gradual (Latin: Graduale Romanum) is an official liturgical book of the Roman Rite of the Roman Catholic Church containing chants, including the Gradual proper and many more, for use in Mass. The latest edition of 1974 takes account of the 1970 revision of the Roman Missal. In 1979, the Graduale Triplex: The Roman Gradual With the Addition of Neums from Ancient Manuscripts ( in English (1985), in Latin) was published. It added reproductions of the neumes from ancient manuscripts placed above and below the later notation.  Description  Sanctissimus namque Gregorius, from the 1908 edition of the Roman Gradual. The Roman Gradual includes the Introit (entrance chant: antiphon with verses), the gradual psalm (now usually replaced by the responsorial psalm), the sequence (now for only two obligatory days in the year), the Gospel acclamation, the offertory chant, and the Communion antiphon. It includes chants that are also published as the Kyriale, a collection of chants for the Order of Mass: Asperges chant, Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei. There have been and are other Graduals, apart from the Roman Gradual. For instance, the Dominican Order had its own rite of Mass and its own Gradual: \\"Graduale juxta ritum sacri ordinis praedicatorum\\" (Gradual according to the rite of the Sacred Order of Preachers).  Structure of the 1974 edition  The 1974 Roman Gradual is arranged into 8 major sections: # Praenotanda (Rubrics) # Proprium de Tempore (Proper of Seasons) # Communia (Commons) # Proprium de Sanctis (Proper of Saints) # Missae Rituales ad Diversa et Votivae (Ritual and Votive Masses) # Cantus in Ordine Missae Occurrentes (Chants Occurring in Order of Mass, including the Kyriale). # Appendix (Containing hymns and litanies) # Missae Propriae Ordinis Sancti Benedicti (Mass Propers of the Order of Saint Benedict)  History  Originally the book was called an antiphonale missarum (\\"Antiphonal of the Mass\\"). Graduals, like the later Cantatory, may have originally included only the responsorial items, the Gradual, Alleluia, and Tract.Apel, Willi, ed (1972). Harvard Dictionary of Music, 2nd edition. Cambridge, Harvard University Press. Page 350 In 1908 a revised edition of the Roman Gradual was published. In it Pope Pius X gave official approval to the work of the monastery of Solesmes, founded in the 1830s by Dom Guéranger, was done by Dom Pothier in restoring Gregorian chant to its purity by removing the alterations it had undergone in the centuries immediately preceding. The work had involved much research and study.Jeffrey Tucker, The Real Catholic Songbook That edition of the Roman Gradual was the basis also of a more general compilation of chants known as the Liber Usualis. This was not an official liturgical book, but it contained all the chants of the Roman Gradual, as well as other chants and hymns and instructions on the proper way to sing them. In 1974, after the Second Vatican Council an edition of the Roman Gradual based on that of 1908 was issued. While the melodies remained unchanged, there was a relocation of pieces to fit the revised Roman Missal and calendar. Some chants were replaced by ancient ones rediscovered after 1908.Gregorian Chant for the Choir A simpler gradual for small churches was published in 1967 and 1975, as the Graduale Simplex.

The Teshierpi River discharges into the narrows between the second and third Dismal Lakes, and the third lake discharges into the Kendall River. The lakes were named by explorer Thomas Simpson. Two miles west of the western lake is Sandy Creek, which flows south into the Dease River. The west end of western lake is surrounded by bare hills covered in sharp broken rock, and it is from this barren area that the lakes get their name. Three small brooks enter the lake at this end, one from the south, and two from the west. Approximately six miles from the western end of the lake it narrows to half a mile, and on the other side of these narrows the lake is surrounded by rounded slopes covered with grass and heaths. There is a shallow sandbar extending across the eastern end of the lake. The narrows between the first and second lakes are a favoured crossing-place for the caribou. The narrow river is confined between steep gravel hills and has a fairly strong current. The center lake is hemmed in by mountains. On the north side the Coppermine Mountains rise in terraces to nearly one thousand feet. There are some small spruce in a cove on the north shore. On the south side of the lake is Teshierpi Mountain, the southernmost spur of the Coppermine Mountains, rising approximately 800 feet. At the east end of the lake is a shallow sandbar which extends across the width of the lake, followed by a series of small willow covered islands. The narrows between the second and third lakes is a short river with a sandy channel. The Teshierpi River joins this channel from the south. The eastern lake is the smallest of the three, approximately three miles long and a mile wide. It is surrounded by gently rising grassy shores and, at a distance, mountains. There is a shallow sandbar extending across the eastern end of the lake. The third lake discharges into the Kendall River, which flows southwest into the Coppermine River. The extreme end of the third lake is sparsely wooded with small spruce, which extend down the Kendall. The Dismal Lakes are one of the historical homes of Nagyuktogmiut, a Copper Inuit subgroup.

It meant empirical, practical legal efforts aimed at solving individual cases, as distinguished from regular jurisprudence which sought to establish abstract rules under which individual cases would fall.Tuori, Kaius. Ancient Roman Lawyers and Modern Legal Ideals: Studies on the Impact of Contemporary Concerns in the Interpretation of Ancient Roman Legal History Vittorio Klostermann: 2007 ; p. 42 Its first proponent was Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex, who thus gave his name to the Roman designation for this kind of law, the cautio muciana. Cautelary law is a tentative \\"procedure\\" used by lawyers. Initially, in Ancient Rome, the idea of inheritance as being subject to conditions was not in practice. With cautio muciana it gave those who are to inherit a legacy, the legatees, a \\"negative authority\\" over something which otherwise would not have occurred until the death of the owner of the legacy, the legator. It thus also makes it possible for the legator to gain promises from legatees. The legatee provides a stipulatio or cautio, promising something in return for a legacy. Thus, for example, it may be stipulated in the negative, \\"I agree that I can have full and exclusive use of, and live in the house, so long as I am not married.\\" The cautio muciana is one of a long list of legal devices invented used by the Romans to address practical situations without changes of general principles. Cautelary jurisprudence nowadays is associated with inheritance law and the administration of trusts. The various inventions by lawyers of these new, arrangements, or forms of law, are often enacted outside of nation or state legislature, but with agreement amongst other lawyers and/or judges. Often, many years later, such arrangements are fully enacted as a 'catching up' exercise by the legislature.

Here, the bar on the left side of the figure is the mixing length. law of the wall, horizontal velocity near the wall with mixing length model In fluid dynamics, the mixing length model is a method attempting to describe momentum transfer by turbulence Reynolds stresses within a Newtonian fluid boundary layer by means of an eddy viscosity. The model was developed by Ludwig Prandtl in the early 20th century. Prandtl himself had reservations about the model, describing it as, \\"only a rough approximation,\\" but it has been used in numerous fields ever since, including atmospheric science, oceanography and stellar structure. Physical intuition The mixing length is conceptually analogous to the concept of mean free path in thermodynamics: a fluid parcel will conserve its properties for a characteristic length, \\\\ \\\\xi' , before mixing with the surrounding fluid. Prandtl described that the mixing length, In the figure above, temperature, \\\\ T, is conserved for a certain distance as a parcel moves across a temperature gradient. The fluctuation in temperature that the parcel experienced throughout the process is \\\\ T'. So \\\\ T' can be seen as the temperature deviation from its surrounding environment after it has moved over this mixing length \\\\ \\\\xi'. Mathematical formulation To begin, we must first be able to express quantities as the sums of their slowly varying components and fluctuating components. =Reynolds decomposition= This process is known as Reynolds decomposition. Temperature can be expressed as: T = \\\\overline{T} + T', where \\\\ \\\\overline{T}, is the slowly varying component and \\\\ T' is the fluctuating component. In the above picture, \\\\ T' can be expressed in terms of the mixing length: \\\\ T' = -\\\\xi' \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{T}}{\\\\partial z}. The fluctuating components of velocity, \\\\ u', \\\\ v', and \\\\ w', can also be expressed in a similar fashion: \\\\ u' = -\\\\xi' \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}}{\\\\partial z}, \\\\qquad \\\\ v' = -\\\\xi' \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{v}}{\\\\partial z}, \\\\qquad \\\\ w' = -\\\\xi' \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{w}}{\\\\partial z}. although the theoretical justification for doing so is weaker, as the pressure gradient force can significantly alter the fluctuating components. Moreover, for the case of vertical velocity, \\\\ w' must be in a neutrally stratified fluid. Taking the product of horizontal and vertical fluctuations gives us: \\\\ \\\\overline{u' w'} = \\\\overline{\\\\xi' ^2} \\\\left  \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{w}}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}}{\\\\partial z}.

History  Tharp had arrived in 1852 in the goldfields around Placerville, becoming a cattleman rather than a miner. Tharp moved to the area of the Kaweah River in 1856, and with guides from the Potwisha people of the area he explored the mountains above. Tharp went back in 1860 with his two sons. They climbed Moro Rock and made an encampment near Crescent Meadows. It was not until 1869 that Tharp moved a cattle herd into the Giant Forest area. Tharp established a small summer cattle ranch at Giant Forest and used a fallen log as a cabin. The log was hollowed by fire through fifty-five feet of its seventy-foot length.

His first comic strip, Torkan appeared in the Australian Sunday Telegraph in 1976 and his second comic strip, Staria, has appeared in the pages of the Australian Daily Telegraph since May 1980. Fletcher has taught children and adults the art of cartooning in the east coast of Australia and Ireland. Biography Born in Murwillumbah, New South Wales, in 1949, Fletcher was captivated by newspaper comic strips and comic books from an early age. He has cited inspiration from English comics like Battler Briton, Paul Wheelahan's The Panther and Monty Wedd's Captain Justice. Fletcher's first job after leaving high school was in the shipping industry but he had not given up his dream of becoming a professional comic artist. He studied art part-time at the Julian Ashton Art School and took a course in scriptwriting at the Australian Film and Television School. During the early 1970s, Fletcher began developing a comic strip about an Australian soldier-of- fortune, titled Nathan Cole, until he was introduced to the world of sword and sorcery by science-fiction writer Fritz Leiber that had a profound impact on his future. In particular, the pair of characters called Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser influenced Fletcher greatly. Fletcher put Nathan Cole aside and set about creating a sword and sorcery strip, titled Orn the Eagle Warrior, in 1974. Riding a giant eagle, sporting a beard and bristling with weapons, Orn's adventures took place on a strange world with a dying sun and two moons. Not everyone, however, shared Fletcher's enthusiasm for his grim barbarian hero. :\\"The reaction of every editor I showed Orn to was, 'What the hell have you been smokin', boy?' I was told in no uncertain terms that if I wanted to get it published, I'd have to tone it down more than a little. I wanted to be published in the Sunday comic pages, so I aimed for somewhere between Prince Valiant and Conan.\\" Born into the warrior clans of Aquiona, Fletcher's new hero, Torkan, was rarely bested in combat. Yet his broadsword could not protect him against his own fiery temper and weakness for comely wenches, both of which often landed him in trouble. Torkan first appeared in Sydney's Sunday Telegraph newspaper in June 1976 and immediately struck a chord with readers. Torkan continues to win new generations of readers; something which Flectcher believes is attributable to the character's enduring appeal. Flectcher claims that \\"the paradigm for heroic adventure was first written in the Bible, as David and Goliath. Whether it's in Arthurian legend or Harry Potter, the paradigm itself doesn't change much – but fashions do change.\\" Levels of violence in the stories have, however, dropped since the strip's early years. John Ryan in his Australian comic anthology, Panel by Panel, describes Torkans success as being due to the upsurge in demand for heoric-fantasy stories created by Marvel Comics' adaptation of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. Encouraged by the success of Torkan, Fletcher began work on his next comic strip idea in 1977—a science-fiction series called Staria. She may be a curvaceous blonde beauty, but Staria is no bimbo. As Captain of the Federation of Intergalactic Peace Keeping Organisation (FIPKO) patrol vessel Venus III, Staria and her crew roam the galaxies, fighting evil and protecting the innocent. Fletcher created his protagonist by taking the common sci-fi stereotypes—the hunky hero, the bimbo and the professorial type—and turned the bimbo into the hero, turned the hunk into a bird-headed Dromad named Kru (the ship's flight engineer) and made the professor into a drunk, Dr. Umbo. Still working full-time while producing the weekly Torkan strip, it took Roger several years to develop Staria and eventually sell it. :\\"I started showing Staria around in 1977, but I was assured that sci-fi was dead as last week's prawn heads. Then along came Star Wars in 1977, and the pundits were proved wrong – as pundits often are.\\" The success of Star Wars may have made it easier to sell Staria, but it was three years before the strip first appeared in Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper in 1980. Like Torkan, Fletcher believes Starias continued popularity stems from her well-defined character. :\\"She is a strong and courageous woman, while still have a nurturing side – she's a bit of a mother hen about her crew,\\" he says. \\"I started off with a tongue-on- cheek writing style, so the character hasn't changed a great deal.\\" Fletcher prefers the freedom of the Sunday format, which allows for more flexibility in drawing than the daily strip, but stories must be strong so that readers can remember them a week later. Fletcher continues to write his strips today. Sydney film company Prodigy Movies is developing projects featuring both of Fletcher's characters. Fletcher has won 'Best Adventure /Illustrated Strip Artist' twice (1998 & 1990) and has been a nominee fourteen times at the Australian Cartoonists' Association's Stanley Awards. In 1999 he was awarded the \\"Jim Russell Award\\" for his contribution to Media Art in Australia.

It is a unit of the Mississippi Army National Guard with units throughout the state of Mississippi. History US Army Aviation units were first organized in Mississippi in 1948 to support artillery units in the northern part of the state and Hattiesburg. These aviation units were located at Grenada Airport 100 miles north of Jackson, Mississippi, the state capitol. In January 1951, all army aviation units in Mississippi were ordered to active duty and sent to Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Six of the original ten aviators saw combat duty in the Korean War. The Grenada facility was closed during this time leaving no active army aviation programs in Mississippi. In early 1953, the Mississippi Aviation program was reorganized at Hawkins Field in Jackson. Mississippi received its first helicopters, two Bell OH-13s, in 1954. By 1958, the program had expanded to include a total of 40 aviators. The Mississippi Army Aviation program began operations as separate companies in 1959 and continued until 1968. During this time full-time maintenance support facilities were opened in Tupelo and Meridian. The state’s first battalion sized aviation unit, the 131st Aviation Battalion, was formed on 15 February 1968. The 131st was in service until 1986 when it was restructured to become an aviation group. In 1987, the 131st Aviation Group was redesignated as the 185th Aviation Group. In 1992, Company E, 185th Aviation in Meridian was redesignated Company G. This resulted in the company’s CH-54 Sky Cranes being replaced by twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook medium lift helicopters. In 1994 the mission of Company C, 1–185th Aviation in Tupelo was changed to armed aerial assault using the OH-58D/I Kiowa Warrior. Company C was then redesignated Company H, 185th Aviation. During 1996 Companies C and D, 1–185th Aviation in Jackson replaced their aging UH-1Hs with the UH-60 Blackhawk. On 1 October 1999, Company H was reformed as Company D, 1–159th Aviation based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. They are one of the first reserve component units in the nation to be part of an active component aviation battalion. The company is still located in Tupelo, Mississippi. Aviation assets under the 185th that are presently located in Mississippi are: * 1st Battalion, 185th Aviation Regiment (UH-60 Blackhawk), Army Aviation Support Facility Jackson * 2nd Battalion, 185th Aviation Regiment (air traffic services), Southaven, Mississippi * Company B, 1st Battalion, 111th Aviation Regiment (CH-47 Chinook), Army Aviation Support Facility Meridian * Detachment 1, Company C, 1st Battalion, 114th Aviation Security & Support Battalion (UH-72 Lakota), Army Aviation Support Facility Tupelo * 1st Battalion, 149th Aviation Regiment (AH-64 Apache), Army Aviation Support Facility Tupelo Headquarters, 185th Aviation Group was deployed to Iraq and stationed at Balad, Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom-II from January 2004 to December 2004. The 185th served as the aviation group for the entire theatre and controlled all aviation assets in the country of Iraq during their deployment. The 185th returned on 24 December 2004. In September 2006 the 185th Aviation Group was redesignated to the 185th Theater Aviation Brigade. It has since changed back. In November 2010, 1st Battalion, 185th Aviation Brigade was again activated to serve in support of Operation New Dawn.

A meeting house used for both town meetings and religious functions was constructed on the Common in 1719, on the same site as the current City Hall. In 1763, the first meeting house was demolished and what became known as The Old South Meeting House was constructed on the site. It was here, on July 14, 1776, that Isaiah Thomas publicly read the Declaration of Independence for the first time in New England. Salem Square The churches of Salem Square ca 1895 Salem Square was a triangular- shaped plaza on the east side of Worcester Common. Facing the square were two churches, the First Baptist Church (c. 1830s), and the Congregational Church (c. 1848). Most of Salem Square was eliminated in the early 1970s as part of the Worcester Center urban renewal project, which replaced the plaza with an office building, shopping mall, and parking garage. Notre Dame des Canadiens The Notre Dame des Canadiens was a landmark church which faced Salem Square and Worcester Common from 1929 to 2018. In the 1920s, the Catholic Church purchased the Baptist Church on Salem Square and razed it in 1927 to build a new church to serve the city's French Catholic population, the cathedral-like Notre Dame des Canadiens. The neo-Romanesque church measured 198 feet long, 91 feet wide, and 64 feet high, and ran from Trumbull Street to Salem Square. The building featured two towers with gold crosses and a 194-foot high bell tower. The Roman Catholic diocese closed the church in 2008, due to falling attendance. The building was sold in 2010 and demolished in October 2018. City Hall Worcester City Hall was designed by Peabody & Stearns and built by the Norcross Brothers in 1898. The Italianate structure was built with a granite exterior, and was partly modeled after Italian Renaissance palazzos.

It premiered on December 3, 2008 on the Travel Channel. The program was originally hosted by actor and food enthusiast Adam Richman. In each episode, Richman explores the \\"big food\\" offerings of a different American city before facing off against a pre-existing eating challenge at a local restaurant. The program airs in syndication at various times during the week. Travel Channel announced in May 2017 that the series would be revived, with actor, food lover, and restaurant business veteran Casey Webb replacing Richman as host. The fifth season premiered on August 7, 2017. Casey Webb's second season on Man v. Food has been renewed with new episodes beginning later in the year. The show moved to the Cooking Channel for season eight, which premiered on July 2, 2019. Host Series host Adam Richman grew up in Brooklyn, New York, completed his undergraduate degree in International Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and earned a master's degree from the Yale School of Drama. A self- educated food \\"fanatic\\", since 1995 he has kept a travel journal including each of the restaurants he visited and what he learned from the trip. Although described as \\"a bit on the husky side\\", to maintain his health while indulging for the show, Richman exercises twice a day while he is on the road. When the schedule permits, he does not eat the day before a challenge and he tries to stay \\"crazy hydrated\\" by drinking plenty of water or club soda and forgoing coffee or soft drinks. After taping for a challenge is complete, Richman spends an hour or so on a treadmill, telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal, \\"Being sedentary is incredibly uncomfortable. Despite the fact that the first 10 minutes or 15 minutes on the treadmill might suck, it actually does alleviate a lot of pressure, and you feel better.\\" Premise In Man v. Food, Adam Richman travels across the United States to explore the culture and unique \\"big food\\" of one city in each episode. In some episodes, Richman takes on food challenges involving very hot and spicy (or piquant) foods (such as foods spiced with habanero peppers), and also large quantities of food, such as a five-pound-sandwich challenge. He finds places in each city to indulge his appetite and visits local landmarks. Richman interacts with local restaurateurs as they demonstrate the making of a house specialty or element of local cuisine. He gives a brief insight to the local community by talking to patrons at the establishments and asking about the most-talked about orders. The show emphasizes quality as well as quantity—a number of the locations in season one are Zagat-rated, while others have received honors from Esquire magazine as home of \\"The Best Sandwiches in America\\". Over the course of the series, his personal record was 37–22 (win-loss) in his food challenges. Combined with the team events in season four, the overall record stands at 48 wins for \\"Man\\" and 38 wins for \\"Food\\". Episodes sometimes include a brief fantasy sequence where Richman pretends to be a character to psych himself up for the episode's big food challenge. The half-hour show culminates in Richman facing off against an established local food challenge. Each show wraps with a fake press conference where Richman fields questions about the challenge as if it were a just-concluded sporting event or as if he had just won, or in some cases lost, a big award. Richman made one attempt at a Guinness World Record when he and a group of 40 regional eaters attempted a 190-pound burger in two hours, in which case food won the battle with about 30 pounds left of the burger. Critical reaction and reviews The Los Angeles Times noted that the Travel Channel received its highest-ever ratings for a new debut with Man v. Food. They highlighted the show as an example of other networks moving in on the traditional turf of the Food Network. In the Star- Ledger, television critic Alan Sepinwall wrote, \\"It ain't deep, and it certainly ain't healthy (I could feel my arteries clog just from watching), but it's fun.\\" Features reporters Thomas Rozwadowski of the Green Bay Press- Gazette said that \\"playfully eager host Adam Richman has won me over\\" and that \\"it's all in good fun.\\" CityPages Minneapolis/St. Paul describes the show, \\"...like the food version of Jackass, with host Adam Richman as its very own Steve-O.\\" Christopher Lawrence of the Las Vegas Review-Journal describes Richman as \\"impressive\\" and \\"likable\\" saying \\"think a beefier Fred Savage, although one who somehow weighs less than he did last season.\\" Jonathan Bernstein of British newspaper The Guardian described \\"mixed feelings\\" about the series saying he likes \\"the concept\\" and \\"the guy\\" but that the challenges make him \\"a little uneasy\\". Charlie Brooker, also of The Guardian, was largely critical of the show's celebration of excess, stating \\"if food is the new porn, this is an all-out orgy between wobbling gutsos and farmyard animals – a snuff orgy, no less, since the latter end up sawn in half and smothered in BBQ sauce.\\" Alton Brown, host of the food science show Good Eats, was also critical of the show, calling Man v. Food \\"disgusting,\\" stating: \\"That show is about gluttony, and gluttony is wrong. It's wasteful. Think about people that are starving to death and think about that show. I think it's an embarrassment.\\" Episodes The Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo =Season 1: December 2008 – March 2009= The weekly series premiered on December 3, 2008, with back to back new episodes airing for the first two weeks then settling down to a pattern of one new episode followed by one repeat episode.

Food, Richman would recruit locals of the selected cities to take on the food challenges, while he serves as their coach.

Richman's retirement On January 27, 2012, Richman announced his retirement from food challenges. No exact reason was given as to why Richman retired, only that he was moving on and wished his audience farewell. Explaining the show's re- tooling to become Man V. Food Nation, Scripps Networks chairman Ken Lowe cited concerns over Adam Richman's health if the show had continued in its previous format. Rumors Richman had since turned vegan were found to be untrue, though he has since lost about .

The logo for \\"El Cuadrilatero\\" (\\"The ring\\") differs very slightly from that of the TV show in that a coffee cup is present instead of a chicken leg.

It consists of a pair of primarily brick factory buildings, one of which was built in 1909, and the other built later, between 1911 and 1922, for the named company, which was a major local manufacturer of thread. After the Bleach and Dye Works closed its doors in 1938, the complex has seen a succession of other owners. The Springdale Dye Works was founded in 1865, and initially operated near Southgate and Gardner Streets on Worcester's south side, and was at the city's industrial height one of six threadmakers. The business's name was changed in 1873 after one of several ownership changes, and in 1879 it moved to premises on Grove Street near the Washburn and Moen Wire Works. In 1888 the company built a wood frame factory at 61 Fremont Street, across the street from the later buildings. This 1888 building was either demolished or partially incorporated into the building now standing on that site. The first building of the present complex was built in 1909, across the street from the 1888 building. The two buildings were originally joined by a bridge over Fremont Street, evidenced by a doorway on the second floor of the front facade of 60 Fremont. The 1909 building is a two-story brick building that fronts directly to the sidewalk on Fremont and Delaware Streets. Its main facade is 18 window bays, and the only major decorative element is the entry bay, which is a Classical Revival style round arch, with granite steps leading up to a recessed entrance. The second brick building is a three-story structure, built in a similar style as the first one. The two are connected by a two-story wood frame structure that runs the length of the first building, and joins at its southeast corner to the second building. This section was finished in stucco during a 1986 renovation, and is occupied by modern offices. The Bleach and Dye Works closed in 1938. The next major occupant of the premises was the Economic Machinery Corporation, which machines for handling adhesive labels, and moved out in 1966. Capital Shoe Footwear, founded in 1955, moved in the following year, and was the last shoemaker in the city, closing its doors in 1984. The buildings were purchased by the Valkyrie Corporation the following year, modernized, and used for the production of small leather goods. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

It has been owned by Naxos since 2015.  History  The Orfeo music label was registered by F. Axel Mehrle on 12 December 1979 as the Orfeo Classic Records and Music Film GmbH. Orfeo introduced a new financial model for the music industry that made all investment to the label tax-deductible. All of Orfeo's masters were digital, pressed using Direct Metal Mastering, distributed as CD starting in 1983, and with a striking navy blue border on all covers. In 1981, some of Orfeo's records were released and distributed by EMI and RCA through a 5-year partnership deal. From 1981 to 1984, the label's yearly revenue went from $100,000 to $2 million. In 1985, as the company was reaching dramatic financial failure, the name of the label was changed to Oro, and the company filed for bankruptcy. In May 1985, Frank Mehrle licensed all of Orfeo's master rights to his associate Dieter Sinn (120 releases). Dieter Sinn created a new company, Orfeo International, to further the sale of the releases. Orfeo international hired many of Orfeo's employees, and took over all of the bankrupted label's international contracts. Despite getting a great catalogue of artists from the start, the costs of operations were excessive and the label got caught up in additional fundraisings that sunk its finances and doomed its spectacular launch. In December 1985, F. Axel Mehrle was charged with fraud and embezzlement relating to the bankruptcy of Orfeo, and a warrant for his arrest was issued. In 2017 qobuz.com released some of the records on the net.  Releases  It has released many classical own productions with artists as Carlos Kleiber, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Rafael Kubelik, Colin Davis, Bernard Haitink, Kurt Eichhorn, Christian Thielemann, Andris Nelsons, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (both as singer and conductor), Jessye Norman, Julia Varady, Margaret Price, Lucia Popp, Diana Damrau, Edita Gruberova, Grace Bumbry, Brigitte Fassbaender, Agnes Baltsa, Carlo Bergonzi, Peter Schreier, Piotr Beczala, Renato Bruson, Bernd Weikl, Kurt Moll, Dmitry Sitkovetsky, Josef Bulva, Oleg Maisenberg, Mischa Maisky, Julius Berger, Karl Leister, Aurèle Nicolet etc. Orfeo owns a well-known sub-label \\"ORFEO D'OR\\", publishing legendary live performances from the archives of the Salzburg Festival, the Bayreuth Festival, the Bavarian State Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra etc. Further, it has produced two records with the late Heinz Ruehmann.

It consists of 19 Victorian houses that either face or abut on Woodland Street, between Charlotte and Oberlin Streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Located directly adjacent to the campus of Clark University, some of the buildings are used by Clark for housing and administration. When Woodland Street was first developed beginning in the late 1860s, it was on the fringes of development in the city. Seven houses were built on the west side of the street, on large lots, and only a few were built on the east side. In the 1890s development accelerated as growing demand for housing pushed the urbanized parts of the city closer to the area. By 1904, the large lots on the west side were subdivided and filled in with additional houses, and the east side was fully developed. The houses that were built in the first phase of development are predominantly Second Empire in their styling, although there are three Gothic Revival buildings (110, 114, 140 Woodland) built between 1876 and 1881, as well as the Italianate Charles Kirby House built c. 1870 (105 Woodland). The houses built in the second phase are either Queen Anne (those built early in the 1890s) or Colonial Revival (those built later). The Frank Heath House at 11 Loudon Street is a particularly notable Colonial Revival house, with a high hip roof, a full front porch, and Palladian windows.

A. stellatus at Red Sea, Egypt Description Arothron stellatus is a medium- sized fish which grows up to in length.http://eol.org/pages/204717/details#size Its body is oval shaped, spherical and relatively elongated. The skin is not covered with scales but is prickly. The fish has no pelvic fin and no lateral line. The dorsal fin and the anal fin are small, symmetric, and located at the rear end of the body. The head is large with a short snout that has two pairs of nostrils, and the mouth is terminal with four strong teeth.Lieske & Myers,Coral reef fishes,Princeton University Press, 2009, The background coloration goes from white to grey, and the body is harmoniously dotted with black spots. The ventral area is usually clearer. The size of the spots is inversely proportional to the size of the fish; thus, a young individual will have large spots and adults of maximal size will have small spots. The juveniles have a yellowish body background coloration with dark stripes. The young adults still have stripes on the ventral area that will turn to spots later, and also some recollection of yellow on the body.

This pufferfish is diurnal. It is mainly solitary and defends a territory. Potential danger Arothron stellatus contains a highly toxic poison, tetrodotoxin, in its ovaries and to a lesser extent its skin and liver, which protects it from voracious predators. It becomes toxic as it eats bacteria that contain the toxin. To ward off potential enemies, they can inflate their bodies by swallowing air or water.

Built about 1926, they are a well-preserved group of Colonial Revival houses built in the last phase of the city's triple decker development. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history Woodford Street is a residential street located on the eastern edge of Worcester's southeastern Vernon Hill neighborhood, running north-south between Koping and Holcombe Streets, parallel to Massachusetts Route 122A. The five houses of this district are located near the southern end of the street. All five were built c. 1926, and are predominantly Colonial Revival in style, although with some Craftsman features. Instead of having a more typical polygonal bay on one side of an asymmetrical facade, these houses have panels of four windows that do not project. They all have clapboard siding on the first level, shingle siding on the upper level and a fully pedimented gable end, with a wide cornice that has regularly spaced brackets. Porches are three-level, although each level generally has different styling. These houses were built during the last decade of Worcester's triple decker development phase. The neighborhood attracted a number of middle-class and predominantly Jewish families, many of whom moved from the Grafton Hill area further north. Early owners and residents included a number of merchants or merchant employees; Max Katz, who owned the two houses at 38 and 40 Woodford was the president of a local brickmaking firm, and also owned a number of other residential properties. 38 Woodford Road See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in eastern Worcester, Massachusetts References Colonial Revival architecture in Massachusetts Houses completed in 1926 Historic districts in Worcester, Massachusetts National Register of Historic Places in Worcester, Massachusetts Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts ","title":"Woodford Street Historic District"},{"id":"20589906","text":"Tetrosomus gibbosus, commonly called camel cowfish because of the hump on its dorsal keel, is one of 22 species in the boxfish family, Ostraciidae. It is a ray finned fish. Other common names include helmet cowfish, humpback turretfish and thornbacked boxfish. It is most closely related to Tetrosomus reipublicae, the smallspine turretfish. T. gibbosus is a species of boxfish native to the Indo-West Pacific, but it has been established in the Mediterranean Sea via Lessepsian migration. It is mainly found at depths of on slopes or over muddy bottoms, but can sometimes be seen near shallow seagrass beds. Like other boxfish species, its flesh is poisonous. It feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates and algae. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep.  Description  T. gibbosus is normally around 20 cm (7.9 in) long when it is fully grown, but can reach up to 30 cm (11.8 in) in length. Fish in the genus Tetrosomus are characterized by the presence of a carapace, a hard upper shell formed by thick scale plates. The body is completely encased in this bony shell, except for a few small openings such as the mouth, eyes, and gills. The mouth is small with fleshy lips and conical teeth usually numbering less than 15.  Biology  T. gibbosus has poisonous flesh, organs, and spines, and is known to secret poisonous mucus in defense or when it is disturbed. This poison can be fatal to humans or other marine organisms that come into contact it. T. gibbosus is hermaphroditic; all individuals of this species are born female, but some may change into males as they grow. Juveniles live together in small schools, but individuals become solitary as they mature into adulthood. T. gibbosus is an omnivorous species, and its diet is known to include seaweeds, sponges, molluscs, worms, and crustaceans found on the bottom of its habitat.  Distribution and habitat  T. gibbosus lives in shallow tropical waters or warm seas with muddy bottoms, at depths of 37–110 meters (121–361 feet). It is a coastal species that is frequently found in coral reefs. It cannot swim long distances and therefore does not live in pelagic waters. Its conservation status is not of concern in any area except for the South China Sea, where it is considered an endangered species.  Lessepsian migration  A Lessepsian migration refers to the migration of a marine species from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, facilitated by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. A species is considered Lessepsian when it has completed this migration and established a population. T. gibbosus was first found in the Mediterranean Sea in 1988. Both the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea have similar salinity levels and temperature ranges, which allows for an easier transition between of these bodies of water. It is thought that Lessepsian species migrated due to changing climates, since the geographic land barrier was removed when the Suez Canal was completed. T. gibbosus is now considered an invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea, as this is not included in its native distribution. It is also considered an established species because it has established a growing population and has been found in multiple locations. It is the first species from the family Ostraciidae to be found in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to its inability to swim long distances, T. gibbosus likely took multiple generations to migrate from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea; this is thought to have happened, in part, from northward currents moving eggs and larvae north towards the Mediterranean Sea.

It is a high Victorian (Queen Anne style) mansion that was built in 1879 as the home of George H. Whitcomb, one of the city's leading businessmen and philanthropists. It is also one of the few surviving houses designed by noted Worcester architect Stephen Earle. George Whitcomb, a Templeton, Massachusetts native, made a fortune in the business of manufacturing envelopes. In addition to this business, he also dealt in real estate in Worcester and elsewhere.

The house Earle designed for Whitcomb is an asymmetrical polychromatic three story granite structure measuring by . Its front facade is divided into three sections, the central one a projecting gable-ended entry. The front door is flanked by sidelights and is topped by a half-round window, all slightly recessed in an archway. Above the door on the second level of the entry section are a pair of windows, in front of which is a decoratively embellished cast iron balcony. The gable also contains a pair of windows, above which the point of the gable is filled with lighter-colored triangular granite stones. The left section of the main facade is two stories, but the roof is pierced by a single steeply- pitched gable dormer. The right section also has a gable dormer, but is truncated because of the presence of a round tower, which is a full three stories high and is topped by a conical roof. Behind the house stands a carriage house, a single story structure built of local stone, topped by a steep slate roof and cupola. The interior of the house has retained some of its original details despite alterations made to accommodate the Society for the Blind's use of the building.

It is native to the Indo-West Pacific. O. cyanosoma is usually a blueish silver color with orange-yellow stripes, and grows to be an average of 6 centimeters. It lives in waters up to 50m in depth, often in lagoons or coral reefs. It is active during the nighttime, feeding on small plants and animals, mostly plankton. It has been the subject of research to test what might happen to marine life by the year 2100, due to predicted carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.  Taxonomy  The prolific Dutch East Indies-resident ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker first described this species in 1853 from a specimen taken at Lawajong off Solor Island in modern Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province. His unique, original holotype is lodged at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. = Etymology = No one has described a synonymous species, so Bleeker's original species name cyanosoma remains unchallenged. However, the genus Apogon which he placed it in masked significant differences between species. More recently, on the basis of physical (2005) and genetic (2014) characteristics, it has been transferred into the genus Ostorhinchus. On the journey to dissecting the O. cyanosoma species complex now incorporating O. cyanosoma, O. rubrimacula, O. wassinki, and O. properuptus, the last was for a while considered a synonym of O. cyanosoma.  Description  Large examples of Ostorhinchus cyanosoma grow to 8 cm in lengthAllen, G.R. and M.V. Erdmann 2012 Reef fishes of the East Indies. Tropical Reef Research, Perth, Australia. Volume I, p. 391. although its average length is 6 cm. The fish is colored silver with a blueish tinge, and has six orange-yellow stripes including a short stripe behind the eye. A new species (Ostorhinchus rubrimacula) was separated out in 1998 from the O. cyanosoma species complex, with almost identical morphology but with a pinkish-red spot on the tail base, and the genetics were confirmed in 2014. Notably, whilst Bleeker noted red fins ('pinnis rubris') in his original sample, he never noted a red tail spot. = Meristics = Using a shorthand meristics formula, O. cyanosoma can be described as having: D, VII + I,9 A, II,8 P, 14 LL, 24 GR, 4–5 + 16–19  Distribution and habitat  = Range = The most comprehensive recent authority locates O. cyanosoma ranging across the Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea south to east Africa, east via western Australia and Queensland to New Caledonia, and north to Ryukyu and Ogasawara islands. = Settlement = It lives in clear water areas of lagoons and shallow reefs, inhabiting waters from 1 to 50 meters (usually above 15m), and makes its home under ledges, in holes, and in between the spines of sea urchins. Coral reef fish settlement tends to be dominated by larval recruitment, but in at least part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, around one third of recruitment of O. cyanosoma at any given coral reef patch tends to be by adult and juvenile migration across intervening sand and coral debris. Within the large aggregations in which O. cyanosoma prefers, stable male-female pairs are often found. Individuals in pairs are more likely to live in one site, and to be able to return to that site if removed (with or without their partner), than are unpaired individuals. Retaining a fixed spatial refuge on a reef may be a crucial factor in surviving the often ferocious piscivorous predation found there. = Parasites = O. cyanosoma specimens have been found with gall bladder infections of Ceratomyxa cyanosomae, Ceratomyxa cardinalis,Ellipsomyxa apogoni, and Zschokkella ohlalae,. Two species have also been found in skeletal muscle cells: Kudoa cheilodipteri and Kudoa whippsi. These tiny cnidarian parasites from class Myxosporea are doubly fascinating because this group can require two intermediate hosts involving two sexual stages (an extremely rare phenomenon in the parasite world).  Behavior  = Diet = O. cyanosoma is mainly a nocturnal planktivore, emerging from hiding in coral caves and crevices to feed by hovering just above sandy microhabitats on coral reef flats. By defecating during the daytime in a non-feeding microhabitat, O. cyanosoma probably helps cycle reef nutrients around different communities on the reef. It appears to prefer to eat small benthic sergestid crustaceans rather than the planktonic larvae to be found higher in the water column. However, seasonal or sampling effects may play a role in defining the diet, since in certain years, certain sites appear to suggest that O. cyanosoma is actually eating significant amounts of planktonic copepods and crustacean larvae. Although its wide mouth gape may be well suited to eating benthic prey, consumption of varying types of prey by cardinalfishes with different mouth shapes appears in reality to be better correlated with varying availability (i.e. many mouth shapes can still make generalist species). = Reproduction = O. cyanosoma is a paternal mouthbrooder. This is likely to be a more important reason for the sexual dimorphism shown by the male's wider gape and more protruding lower jaw, than is its prey specificity. A bigger mouth allows for more eggs to be protected from predation, and for better water circulation (for oxygenation in both eggs and parent). Pair bonding in O. cyanosoma does not appear to provide the expected genetic benefits of monogamy, indeed like many pair bonding fishes in its family, predation seems to have driven it rather than reproductive exclusivity.  Importance to humans  = Tourism = Often stationary and visible low on the reef during the day time, aggregations of O. cyanosoma add to the captivating underwater pallette enjoyed by recreational Scuba divers, whose presence also contributes significantly to local economies in often poorer tropical countries. = Aquariums = Export of live specimens contributes to the enjoyment of marine aquarium hobbyists, which if managed appropriately, can also benefit local, often poorer, communities. = Research = O. cyanosoma has been used as a laboratory experimental animal to test what might happen to marine life by the year 2100, given predicted atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. It appears that the negative effects on fish metabolic rate (and related survival) of ocean acidification caused by extra carbon dioxide dissolution could be equivalent to an extra 3 °C of water temperature (which global warming is already causing). Reef fish populations in higher (cooler) latitudes appear to have more capacity to cope with rising temperatures and acidification than those nearer the equator.

It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 12 cm in length. Taxonomy This fish was first described by Hugh McCormick Smith and Lewis Radcliffe after its collection during the 1907-1910 United States Bureau of Fisheries Albatross Philippines expedition.Radcliffe, L. (1911): Notes on some fishes of the genus Amia, family of Cheilodipteridae, with descriptions of four new species from the Philippine Islands.

Description Although the maximum recorded standard length of O. compressus is 12 cm, its most common adult length is around 8.5 cm. Adults are pinkish-white, with six brown stripes along each side, iridescent blue eye rings, and up to four brown spots on the caudal peduncle (tail base). Juveniles begin with a black spot on a yellow caudal peduncle, which appears to mimic juveniles of certain piscivorous species of Cheilodipterus. Sub-adult = Meristics = Using a shorthand meristics formula, O. aureus can be described as having: D, VI-I,9 A, II,9 P, 13-14 LL, 24 GR, 7-8 + 20-22Allen, G.R. and M.V. Erdmann 2012 Reef fishes of the East Indies. Tropical Reef Research, Perth, Australia. Volume I, p. 390. Distribution and habitat =Range= Ostorhinchus compressus occurs in Australian waters from the Scott Reef, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and Rowley Shoals in Western Australia; and from the Great Barrier Reef to the Middleton & Elizabeth Reefs Reserve and Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea. Its wider distribution extends through the Indo-Pacific from the Andaman Sea to Vanuatu and New Caledonia and as far north as southern Japan. =Ontology= Research on the larval stage of this species shows that as it develops, its ability to see in ultraviolet light increases. Given that the larval stage is pelagic, this implies that older larvae can migrate down the water column to feed. This might improve its predator evasion, whilst improving its food intake. =Settlement= Generally found from 2-20 metres, adults rest during the daytime in floating mixed species groups with other Apogonids. They are not very picky, being found resting in association with several kinds of live hard coral, Gorgonians, dead coral, rubble, and sand. Possibly because of the low water circulation, higher temperatures, and high oxygen consumption of some of the shallow branching corals into which O. compressus retreats from predators, it has been found to tolerate very low dissolved levels of oxygen, even at a temperature of 30 °C (which is likely to stimulate a relatively high resting metabolic rate). =Parasites= The gills of O. compressus have been found infected with Gyrodactylid flatworms.

Orontium aquaticum Linnaeus, Flora of North America and is found growing in ponds, streams, and shallow lakes. It prefers an acidic environment. The leaves are pointed and oval with a water repellent surface. The inflorescence is most notable for having an extremely small almost indistinguishable sheath surrounding the spadix. Very early in the flowering this green sheath withers away leaving only the spadix. The sheath was originally classified by Adolf Engler as a spathe due it being the last foliar piece before the spadix.A. Engler, (1887).

However, in a 1988 paper Thomas Ray argued that the structure was misidentified by Engler and was actually a sympodial leaf. According to Ray the spathe was missing and not the sympodial leaf.

Built sometime between 1879 and 1886, it is one of the first apartment blocks built in the Main-Wellington- Chandler area, which had one of the city's highest concentrations of such buildings by 1900. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Willard Richmond Apartment Block stands on the southeast corner of Austin and Irving Streets, a short way southwest of Worcester's central downtown area. It is a four-story brick structure, with granite trim. It is basically a mostly rectangular L shape, with a corner missing at the southeast of the building. The street- facing facades have a stringcourse of granite between the partially-exposed basement and the first floor, with another above the first floor window lintels. First floor windows are set in square openings, while those on the second and third floors are set in segmented-arch openings. The fourth floor windows are set in round-arch openings with brick headers and granite keystones, with a band of corbelled brickwork joining the windows at the base of the arched portion. Windows above the main and secondary entrances are treated differently: those above the secondary (Irving Street) entrance have segmented-arch openings. On the second-level above the main entrance are two round-arch windows, with a rectangular one above them, separated by a decorative panel from a large round-arch window at the top. The building was built sometime between 1879 and 1886, and was one of the earliest buildings in what became, by 1900, one of the city's largest apartment house districts, the Main-Wellington-Chandler area. This area, convenient to downtown Worcester, experienced rapid growth in the 1880s and 1890s. Many of its apartment blocks have since been torn down, and this is one of a few surviving remnants of that past.

The complex, which was built between 1870 and 1930, is a reminder of the large carpet manufacturing business that was once a major presence in the city. It is a complex of 15 brick buildings located on a bend of the Middle River (a tributary of the Blackstone River), south of Crompton Street and just west of Interstate 290. The mill complex has its origins in about 1870, when the first of the surviving buildings, a three-story brick building with a mansard roof, was erected by the Crompton Rug Company. It was followed a few years later by a dye house. Crompton Rug went out of business in 1879, and these premises were leased to William Hogg, who eventually formed the Worcester Carpet Company, which expanded the complex with a second major mill and the purchase of additional water rights in 1893. Matthew Whittall, who first gained notice as a supervisor at Crompton Rug, had opened his own factory in other parts of Worcester in 1874. By 1883 his business had grown, and he acquired land next to the Crompton works, where he built a series of buildings over the next 23 years. At the time of the First World War, Whittall was the largest employer in south Worcester, with 1,500 workers operating 350 mills in 500,000 square feet of factory space. The products he produced were purchased by the federal government for use in its buildings, and were selected by President William McKinley for use in the White House.

Description Chromis chromis has an oval and laterally compressed body with an noticeably large eye. Its mouth is strongly protractile, reaching to below the centre of the eye, with small canine-like teeth set in 3 rows on the jaws. The preoperculum is not serrated and the anterior gill arch has 30 slender gill rakers. There are 13-14 spines and 10-11 soft rays in the dorsal fin and in the anal fin has 11 spines and 10-12 soft rays. Its body is covered in large scales, including the head, and there are 24-30 scales along the lateral line. The youngest fish are a brilliant iridescent blue in colour; older juveniles have blue stripes with the dorsal and anal fins outlined in blue while the adults are dark brown with the centres of each scale a paler golden brown or grey-brow and with the edge of the caudal fin lacking any colour, especially in the centre of the fork. The males become a vivid pale violet. There is a single pair of nostrils. It can grow up to a size of in length, with a common length of . Distribution and habitat Chromis chromis occurs in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic, from Portugal to Angola including the Macaronesian Islands and the Gulf of Guinea Islands, appearing to be commoner off islands than off the mainland. It is uncommon in the Black Sea and Sea of Marmara. C. chromis inhabits littoral, mainly in rocky areas from in depth, in small shoals in midwater above or near rocky reefs and above sea-grass meadows. Diet It feeds on small zooplankton and benthic algae. Its main food components are copepods, appendicularia, cladocera, gastropod larvae, bivalve larvae, fish eggs and fish larvae. C. chromis feeding patterns are altered when schools are confronted with an increase in top water activity, resultantly, the species obtained a behavioral response referred to as polarizing. Polarization occurs when the species dives to deeper depths, leaving their food behind, as a mechanism to avoid confrontation. Fishing Due to small size Chromis chromis has minor role in commercial fishing. As a game fish, it is often caught during the day on light tackle. Small hooks are baited with bread, pasta, small chunks of fish, mussels, worms, small prawns etc. It can be caught in fish traps and nets. Due to small size, it is rarely caught with a speargun. It is also used as a baitfish for larger species which predate on damselfish schools such as conger eel Conger conger and common dentex Dentex dentex. Cuisine White meat is soft and tender. Unfortunately, due to small size, it is mostly pan fried. Boiled with other small fish is used for fish soup. Larger specimens are prepared as part of mixed fish stew. Reproduction Spawning depends on location, but it occurs during summer. The male and females pair up and engage in courtship behaviour and the eggs are laid in a nest which is created on rocky, sometimes sandy bottoms. The eggs adhere to the substrate and are guarded by the male. The female can lay between 6,050 and 73,688 eggs.

Contemporary Milton's later political works were widely known but were highly controversial and criticized, especially after the Restoration. The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates immediately influenced many others, including Bulstrode Whitelocke, John Canne, John Lilburne, John Twyn, and various anonymous works. The amount of attention that the work received prompted John Shawcross to declare that the work, itself, allowed Milton to be viewed as a \\"great writer\\".Shawcross 1993 p. 105 However, the work continued to influence writers later on, including a piece by Algernon Sidney, which copies words directly from The Tenure; many responders to Sidney did not know that the lines were Milton's own.Shawcross 1993 p. 106 Eikonoklastes suffered a far different fate; it was able to appeal to a larger audience than many of Milton's previous works and sell well,Von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239 but it was a failure in turning the public sentiment against Charles I.Raymond 2003 p. 206 After the Act of Oblivion was enacted on 29 August 1660, a proclamation by the king demanded that Eikonoklastes and Defensio pro Populo Anglicano be burned.Pfister 2002 p. 54 This did not stop the work from selling, and there was a new edition in 1690 after the Glorious Revolution.Shawcross 1993 p. 278 Enlightenment The generation of poets following the Restoration were influenced by Milton's poetry, especially Paradise Lost, and viewed it favorably. Alexander Pope, as poet, was heavily influenced by Milton, but he was not as directly attached to the language and concepts within the poetry as other poets, including the English Romantics.Brisman 1973 pp. 7–8 However, near the end of his life Pope planned to compose an epic on Brutus, that was to be written in Miltonic blank verse. John Dryden, in an epigram, believed that Milton ranked with Homer and Virgil; but it is uncertain how sincere Dryden was, given that the conventions of the time expected such lofty commendations of individuals. John Dennis praised Milton for composing a poem that was original, and Voltaire teased that France was unable to produce a similarly original epic.Stevenson 2003 p. 449–450 Samuel Johnson criticized Milton for various things: he attacked Milton for archaic language,Needham 1982 pp. 95–96 he blamed Milton for inspiring bad blank verse,Greene 1989 p.27 and he couldn't stand Milton's puritan and republican beliefs.Bate 1977 p.537 Johnson did respect Milton's poetry, and relied on it for many of the quotes contained in his Dictionary of the English Language.Greene 1989 pp. 134–135 Johnson's contemporaries had mixed views of Milton. Although Handel experienced success by setting Milton's poetry to music, including Il Penseroso, L'Allegro, and Samson Agonistes, he refused to transform Paradise Lost into an oratorio, objecting to the epic's religious content. Likewise, Edward Gibbon questioned Milton's use of God as a character within a poem and Shaftesbury wondered if it was correct to alter Scripture in such a way.Stevenson 2003 p. 458 Still, many people believed that Paradise Lost equaled the classical epics.Stevenson 2003 p. 450 Romantics The English Romantic Poets were concerned with Milton's poetry, and they associated themselves with Milton as they sought to explore their own poetic identities. In particular, the various poets relied on images and ideas found in Milton, and they incorporated them into their own works. William Wordsworth, in his The Prelude, relies on Milton's concept of the fall of man in order to revise the myth and to try and overcome the loss of paradise. John Keats, in The Eve of St Agnes, relies on images connected to Paradise Lost and Eve's description. Percy Shelley, in Mont Blanc, relies on Milton's description of sensations, especially smell, to achieve the sublime.Brisman 1973 pp. 2–6 Victorian 20th century Kay Stevenson points out that \\"Milton's Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained are the seventeenth-century epics which still attract an audience\\".Stevenson 2003 p. 448 Notes References * Bate, Walter Jackson.

The site that became Careysburg was selected for its abundance of fresh water, potential for agriculture, its cool temperature, absence of deadly mosquitoes, and scenic view. At the time, the people living in the surrounding area were of the Kpelle, Gola and Queh tribes, and Rev. Says negotiated with local tribal chiefs to purchase land. In 1859, Careysburg was settled by North American freed slaves, mainly from the United States and Barbados. However, some Africans recaptured from ships at sea, destined for sale as slaves in Europe and America, were also settled in Careysburg.

It includes sixteen properties along Jacques Avenue, and Wellington and Irving Streets, most of which were built between 1887 and 1901. The notable exception is the Harrington House at 62 Wellington Street, a c. 1850s Greek Revival house that was virtually the only house standing in the area before development began in the 1880s. The first other building in the area was also a single family residence, the brick and stone Queen Anne Victorian built in 1855 by Thomas Barrett at 41 Wellington. This was followed in the next few years by six smaller apartment houses that were built with floor plans similar to Worcester's many wood frame triple deckers, but they were built of brick and trimmed in stone. These buildings (23, 25, 37, and 45 Wellington, and 1 and 5 Jacques) were generally owner-occupied. The development that followed these early buildings was done by developers building income properties, which were larger (at least two apartments per floor), and followed a central hall plan that such apartment blocks followed elsewhere in the city. These were built of brick or stone, and generally trimmed in stone. The only non-residential building in the district is the Gothic Revival First Freewill Baptist Church, designed by Lawrence, Massachusetts architect George G. Adams and built in 1888.

Background  Lu Mai was born in 739, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His territory of origin is variously reported in the official histories as Fanyang (according to the Old Book of TangOld Book of Tang, vol. 136 .) or Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the eastern capital Luoyang) (according to the New Book of TangNew Book of Tang, vol. 150 .). He was from \\"The second house of northern ancestry\\" (北祖第二房) of the prominent Lu clan of Fanyang, and he was a distant relative of Lu Han, who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong. Lu Mai's direct male-line ancestors, for several generations, including his grandfather Lu Keming (盧克明) and father Lu Zhao (盧沼), served as local officials.New Book of Tang, vol. 73 Lu Mai was described as filially pious, loving to his siblings, and careful in his youth, and his maternal uncle Cui Youfu, also a chancellor during Emperor Dezong's reign, loved and respected him.  Early career  After Lu Mai passed the imperial examinations, he successively served as a scribe for the crown prince (太子正字, Taizi Zhengzi)However, as it is not known when this occurred, it is not known which crown prince Lu Mai served under. and sheriff of Lantian County (藍田, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). As his written judgments were considered superb, he was then made a secretary at Hunan Municipality. After higher level officials recommended him for his literary talent, he successively served as You Bujue (右補闕), a low level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng); Shiyushi (侍御史), an imperial censor; Xingbu Yuanwailang (刑部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, Xingbu), and Libu Yuanwailang (吏部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Libu). During a famine caused by a locust infestation, Lu requested an assignment to the Yangtze River region, because at that time his uncle and siblings were all in that region. He was thus made the prefect of Chu Prefecture (滁洲, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui). He later returned to the capital Chang'an to serve as Simen Langzhong (司門郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of justice and then You Jianyi Daifu (右諫議大夫), an advisor at the legislative bureau. While serving there, he often submitted suggestions to the emperor. He later served as imperial attendant (給事中, jishizhong), when he was set to be evaluated for a further evaluation for promotion. He declined, on the basis that he had not served long as jishizhong and therefore should not be considered for yet another promotion at that time. For this, he was much respected by others, and he was later promoted to be Shangshu You Cheng (尚書右丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). While he was serving there, there was an occasion when the minister of palace affairs, Yuan Gen (元亙), was supposed to serve as the ceremonial sacrifice leader for sacrifices to Emperor Dezong's deceased wife Empress Wang.As Empress Wang died in 786, this event must have happened that year or later. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 52 . Yuan declined on the basis that the sacrifices to Empress Wang were set on a day that one of his parents had died, and the imperial censors submitted an indictment against Yuan for insubordination. A number of officials were convened to discuss the indictment, and Lu pointed out that Yuan's duty should be first to the state, and he should not have declined on the basis of a family matter. Yuan was thus fined.  Chancellorship, resignation, and death  In 793, Lu Mai was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor de facto, serving with Jia Dan, Lu Zhi, and Zhao Jing.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. As Lu Zhi and Zhao effectively were the lead chancellors, Lu Mai was not much involved in the major decisions, and he was said to be cautious and obedient to the law. He was also praised for personally attending the funeral of a cousin, as at that time, chancellors often considered themselves too important to attend the funerals of distant relatives. In 796, Lu Mai suffered a stroke while at the office of the chancellors, and was taken home in a litter. He offered to resign, but Emperor Dezong declined. As Lu Zhi had by this point been demoted and exiled, Zhao had died, on an occasion when Jia was away observing a memorial for a parent, there was no chancellor on duty, and Emperor Dezong had to send eunuchs to the office of the chancellors to make sure that the affairs of the state were being attended to.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. Lu Mai subsequently submitted five petitions offering to resign, and in 797, Emperor Dezong approved his resignation and made him Taizi Bingke (太子賓客), an advisor to his crown prince Li Song. Lu died in 798 and was given posthumous honors. As his two marriages did not yield a son, his heir Lu Ji (盧紀) was a son of a cousin.

Certain markets received the GT380 until model year 1980. GT380, GT550, GT750 The initial lineup consisted of the GT380 three cylinder (marketed in North America as \\"Sebring\\"); GT550 three cylinder (marketed in North America as \\"Indy\\") and GT750 three cylinder (marketed in North America as \\"LeMans\\") =Engines= Engines were piston-ported two-stroke with Suzuki's multi-point oil injection system, marketed as Crankcase Cylinder Injection (CCI) (previously marketed as PosiForce), conventional battery/points ignition system and chain-type final drive. The motorcycles featured engines with Schnuerle porting. Alternators featured a three-phase excited field type using brushes and slip rings with a wound rotor. A solid state rectifier and a mechanical three-step regulator completed the system. Previously Suzuki had primarily used a permanent magnet single phase alternator setup on its bikes so the new equipment was quite a step up for the GT series. The 380 and 550 engines were air-cooled with a system marketed by Suzuki as Ram Air. This system consisted of a cast aluminum shroud covering a modified cylinder head to direct the cooling air. The GT750 was liquid-cooled. Suzuki thus led the motorcycle world by being the first company to mass- produce a liquid-cooled, large-bore two-stroke engine. The GT750 was nicknamed the \\"Water Buffalo\\" in North America and the \\"Kettle\\" in the UK.Wilson, Hugo. (1993) The Ultimate Motor-Cycle Book p.127 1971 Suzuki GT750 \\"... nicknamed 'Water Buffaloes' in America and 'Kettles' in Britain\\". Dorling Kindersley Accessed and added 2015-07-27 Other names were the \\"Wasserbüffel\\" in Germany, \\"la bouillotte\\" in France and the \\"Water Bottle\\" in Australia. The 550 initially featured chrome-plated piston rings and cast iron cylinder bores. For the 1976 MY, the 550 received a system of cast-iron rings running in chrome-plated cylinder bores. This change was largely thanks to the RE5, which also used a proprietary cylinder wall plating similar to a Nikasil coating. The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder clearance. For MYs 1972 and 1973 the carburetors had been three separate items with the complex cabling. 1974 models featured The unitized carburetors mounted to a single bracket with a less complex single push-pull cable arrangement for easier and more durable synchronization. The unitized carbureters continued through to the end of production of the three-cylinder models, when the GT750 received the Mikuni BS40 type diaphragm style carburetors. All smaller models featured Mikuni VM type round slide caruretors. The three-cylinder GT models featured bifurcation of the center cylinder exhaust header. This allowed Suzuki to use four mufflers rather than an unbalanced \\"2 and 1\\" or a \\"three into two\\" exhaust arrangement. The GT550 and GT750 featured electric starting while other models, with the exception of the GT185, were kick start only. All models were equipped with five-speed transmissions with the exception of the GT250 and GT380 which had a six-speed, and all models were equipped with drum brakes front and rear. 1973 three-cylinder models were equipped with hydraulically operated single disc brakes on the front with drum brakes on the rear.

Frames were all-welded mild steel tubing with long wheelbases to give stability at high speed. =GT380 for Italy= GT380 version produced for the Italian market A marketing anomaly concerned the GT380. The actual engine displacement as introduced in the 1972 MY was 371cc and the 380 stayed this way until the end of production for most market areas. For the Italian market only, the GT380 received a displacement increase to 384cc starting with the 1975 MY. This engine size was continued through to the end of production for Italy alone. This was a counter to an Italian government import ban on bikes less than 380cc and less than 170 kg. Suzuki simply increased the bore of the GT380 to 55 mm, thus making the engine capacity now 384cc. Suzuki also made sure that the data plate riveted to the frame showed a weight of 171 kg. GT250 Suzuki GT250 For the 1973 MY, the T250 twin was updated with new bodywork, Ram Air cooling, a single disc brake in front and was now designated GT250. The GT250 retained its original engine and six-speed transmission, both remaining basically unchanged from the T20 X6 Hustler of 1966 through the T250 model to the 1972 MY. The marketing name of \\"Hustler\\" was retained for the North American market. The GT250 continued on with minor changes until the 1976 MY when the engine was changed substantially, both internally and externally. Porting changes now saw the cylinders with four larger transfer ports instead of the previous two small as well as changes to the CCI system in the crankshaft main bearing area. The carburetors became 28 mm in size instead of 26 mm, the mufflers were modified to cater for the increased airflow through the engine and the transmission ratios were revised to more evenly match the new powerband. The Ram Air cover for the head was deleted and the stock finning on the heads was increased in height to gain the same effect as the Ram Air used to give. GT185 For model year 1973, Suzuki introduced the GT185 twin-cylinder model equipped with Ram Air cooling, drum brakes front and rear and a combination electric starter/generator setup -- marketed in North America as the \\"Adventurer\\". For model year 1974, the GT185 gained a single- disc front brake to rationalize it with the other GT models. It then remained basically unchanged, except for colour and trim items (which included a tail fairing in the 1977 'B' model and cast wheels in the final year 1978 'EC' model), through to the end of production with the 1978 MY. In some markets the GT185 became the RG185 and was sold with different trim. The 1974 model had a fatal engine flaw that caused steel powder and eventually half of the transmission oil dipstick to drop into the transmission. The rubber stopper for the transmission oil fill hole allowed the dip stick to vibrate enough to contact the primary drive gear. If not caught within ~300 miles from new, the bearings in the transmission would be ruined. GT125 The 1974 MY also saw Suzuki introduce the GT125 to the motorcycling world. This model was similar in layout to the GT185 but with a shorter wheelbase and smaller engine displacement so shared only a few common parts. The rest of this model's equipment followed that of the GT185. The electric starter was deleted, probably in the interests of economy, which allowed a more attractive selling price in the very competitive \\"beginner\\" market that this model competed in. This model continued basically unchanged, excepting colours and trim items (the 'B' model in 1977 got a tail fairing), until the end of production with the 1977 MY. Some markets received 1978 MY (the 'EC' which had tail fairing & cast wheels) & there were MY 1979 & MY 1980 versions of this model with the name changing to RG125 X4. The final GT125s were updated and sold with cast wheels and a tail fairing. Suzuki listed the RG125 X4 in their sales literature until 1980 in continental Europe. GT500 For the 1976 MY, the aging two-cylinder T500 Titan was given a new front end with a single-disc brake as well as freshened up bodywork. It was henceforth known as the GT500. The GT500 was discontinued at the end of the 1977 MY, so had a very short production life. The GT500 was not graced with Ram Air cooling, probably because Suzuki already knew that their large-capacity two-stroke road bikes were reaching the end of their production lives. It was probably a way to get a few more sales dollars from what had now become a very dated design reaching back to the 1968 MY. Competition machines Suzuki TR500 water jacketed engine in a Bimota chassis Suzuki went racing at various levels with modified GT750s and T500s. The factory TR750 ultimately produced 115 bhp and was Suzuki's basis for the then-new F750 category including Daytona 200 participation, with contracted riders like Barry Sheene and Ron Grant. Both the TR750 and TR500 models were famously campaigned by Barry Sheene who became inaugural F750 champion in 1973 and in 500 cc Grand Prix racing with factory- supported development-rider Jack Findlay. The TR500 was initially air-cooled becoming a water-cooled derivative producing 83 bhp.Bike, October 1975 pp.32-39 Inside the Hundred-Horsepower Teams by Jim Greening.

The head is slightly longer than it is high, with a large eye and oblique mouth. The teeth are in two series and have rounded tips. The dorsal fin has 13 spines and 13 to 14 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 spines and 14 soft rays; the first anal spine is half the size of the second. The first ray of the pelvic fins is much elongated, and is longer than the head. The pectoral fins are rather shorter, and the caudal fin is shallowly forked with rounded lobes. The colour of this fish is a uniform yellow, and there is a small orange spot at the base of the pectoral fin (except for fish in the Philippines). Distribution and habitat Pomacentrus moluccensis is native to the tropical western Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from about 32°N to 32°S, and 92°E to 173°W. It is found down to about in clear-water lagoons and in reefs with branching corals to provide hiding places. Ecology The lemon damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis lives in and around coral reefs and is found in small groups. The diet consists mostly of algae, but planktonic invertebrates are also eaten. This fish forms pairs during the breeding season, the female laying her eggs on the substrate and the male guarding them and fanning them to keep them well-aerated. This fish is preyed on by such predatory fish as Cephalopholis boenak and Pseudochromis fuscus, and is better able to evade them and survive in high shelter environments such as provided by Pocillopora damicornis than low shelter ones provided by Acropora nobilis .

It has been described as one of the oldest synagogues in Europe. After many centuries of use for other purposes, the building re-opened as a synagogue and museum in 2002. No congregation prays regularly at the Sinagoga Major, but it is used for festive occasions. History Archaeological investigations show that the original structure of the building was built in the third or fourth century; whether this structure was the synagogue cannot be said with certainty. The building was significantly expanded during the 13th century. Medieval Barcelona is known to have had several synagogues, and the main synagogue was certainly in the immediate area.Other sources say fifth or sixth century. Fifth century: Sixth century: King James I visited the synagogue in 1263 at the conclusion of the Barcelona Disputation. Shlomo ben Aderet served as the rabbi of the Sinagoga Major for 50 years. The Jews of Barcelona were massacred in 1391. The building was used for many purposes and its original use was forgotten. Over the centuries, additional stories were added to the building. In 1987, Jaume Riera y Sans began researching the location of the Sinagoga Major. His research was based on a reconstruction of the route followed by a thirteenth- century tax collector that ended at the Sinagoga Major. Riera's work led Miguel Iaffa to examine the exterior of the building. Iaffa noted that the structure had been built in compliance with religious requirements that the building should face Jerusalem and that it should have two windows. In fact, the eastward orientation of the building (toward Jerusalem) broke with the northwest/southeast alignment of the streets in its neighborhood. Iaffa purchased the building in 1995 when its owner put it up for sale. The Call Association of Barcelona (),The Catalan word call refers to the Jewish quarter of a city. led by Iaffa, undertook the recovery and restoration of the synagogue. The Sinagoga Major was opened to the public in 2002, and it drew 20,000 visitors during 2005. In 2003, two Canadians became the first couple to be married at the Sinagoga Major in more than 600 years. A New York attorney donated a 500-year-old sefer Torah (Torah scroll) to the synagogue in 2006. In January 2009, a right-wing extremist affiliated with the Republican Social Movement attacked the Sinagoga Major. He struck the building's facade repeatedly with a baseball bat, and when a synagogue employee approached him, he beat the worker so severely with the bat the man had to be hospitalized with cerebral contusions and a broken arm. The attacker was detained by police.

Description and history The Timothy Paine House is located in northeastern Worcester, set on a lot between Lincoln and Paine Streets in the Brittan Square area. It is set back from Lincoln Street, which was historically the main road between Worcester and Boston. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The house's main entrance was originally on its south facade, but a new main entrance was placed on the east (Lincoln Street) facade some time after its construction. Timothy Paine acquired of land in this part of Worcester in 1767, and began developing it as a country estate in 1774. His Loyalist leanings were noted early in the American Revolution, and he was forced by a mob to resign his post as mandamus councilor to the governor. He eventually fled to Halifax, Nova Scotia; his son returned after American independence and recovered the property. The house was significantly enlarged and given Federal styling during his ownership. It passed through three more generations of Paines until 1914, when it was purchased by the local DAR chapter.

Description and history The Raymond House is set on the north side of George Street, a side street that steeply climbs the hill to the west of Worcester's Main Street and downtown. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, and clapboard siding. The building corners are pilastered, and a single- story porch extends across the front, with fluted Doric columns rising to an entablature and hip roof. The wall under the porch is flushboarded, with long sash windows and the entrance set in the leftmost of three bays. The gable above is fully pedimented, with a sash window at the center. The house was built c. 1847 by Tilley Raymond, who, along with Horatio Tower, became one of Worcester's leading builders of the 1840s and 1850s. Raymond eventually left for California, apparently to capitalize on the gold rush, and the house was taken over by his son Edward. Edward Raymond was a veteran of the American Civil War, and served locally as the chief of police and clerk of the district court. He was admitted to the bar in 1880 after studying with George Hoar. The house was converted into apartments in 1898.

A seminal study was published by Christine Fell as Women in Anglo-Saxon England in 1984. According to Fell, women were \\"near equal companions to the males in their lives, such as husbands and brothers, much more than in any other era before modern time\\". Despite this sense of equality in some strata of society, Anglo Saxon women were still subject to concubinage. Gender was influenced by social status, religion and sexuality. They were not only allowed to have private influence, but also a wide liberty of intervention in public affairs.  Occupations  Women and children were generally involved in tasks that required little physical work. Though, due to climate and weather constraints, women may have done the work that needed attention at the time. While men were ox-herders, labourers, swine-herders, and so forth, women were cheese-makersCarol Hough (1999) and dairy-maids. They were also bakers, though not cooks. In Old English the word for cook is coc, and is only found in the masculine form, while baecere and bascestre respectively represent the feminine and masculine forms of baker. Female slaves were corn-grinders, serving maids, wet-nurses, weavers, and seamstresses. Common free women may have been found spinning as well as weaving. Women and ladies, including queens, would serve drinks for company and family. This was not only a job for a woman of lower-class, though it would have likely been done by a low-class woman if one were present. Women of this time were also entertainers, comedians, and singers, and may have been employed by households or travelling groups.  Christianity  Churches in Anglo-Saxon England stressed doctrines that preached about virginity as a virtue and faithful monogamy; this is believed to have limited an individual’s chances of acquiring status, political power and property. Anglo-Saxon England was one of the first places in history where women were raised to sainthood, and this was most keenly observed immediately following the acceptance of Christianity. Christianity provided certain level of freedom for women and helped them rise to some of the most powerful positions in society. Within the church, women received relatively equal status despite there being evidence of anti-feminism found in homilies. Although anti-feminism was found in homilies, it does not always hold true in practice. Women who went into the convent and took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience were glorified in the eyes of the Church and its Fathers. The convent offered self-development and social responsibility to women, something that women are still fighting for today. Uniquely, the Anglo-Saxon church had institutions that consisted of male and female monasteries, located together but segregated. In these, the female abbot assumed the headship of the institution. Convents were run by abbesses, this is evidence that women held positions of visibility and significance. They were responsible for the finances and management of property, with help from some of the resident nuns.Carol Hough (1999) This level of authority did not survive the Viking invasion of 789, although women continued to play a major role in the church in late Anglo-Saxon England. The presence of single gendered convents and monasteries meant chores that were commonly done by the other sex, would have been performed by the common sex. For example, men would have worked in the kitchens of monasteries and women would have worked in the gardens of nunneries. It is clear that there were equal opportunities for men and women in the Christian Church in Anglo-Saxon England, but it is still important to look at the \\"Patriarchs of the Bible.\\" Although women were given these opportunities, they were given by men and the Church's significant positions of authority were all held by men. Thus the gender differences and ideological conflicts surrounding sexuality and kinship, amongst others, resulted from the introduction of Christianity.  Marriage and divorce  In Anglo-Saxon England, there were many laws related to marriage.Carol Hough (1999) Some historians profess that the law that neither widow, nor maiden was forced to marry a man that she disliked as being a sign of equality; however, Aethelberht's law contradicts this in as much as a man is legally allowed to steal another man's wife as long as he pays him reparation. Once married, a woman was to situate herself as the object of her husband's subjectivity, she was to become the object of his protection and the property, although she still remained the owner of her property. The Church held that married women had no authority and were to stand under the lordship of men. Therefore, under the church they were not able to teach, witness, take an oath, nor be a judge. In marriage, a male often developed his sphere of influence through his wife. Although women were seen as such under the church, there were laws that protected them in the public sphere when married. Divorce was rare, and the only documented ones were in cases of adultery. A woman who committed adultery by sleeping with a man who was not her husband while her husband was still alive was subject to give what she owned to her husband. Æthelraed's 1008 code states that widows shall remain unmarried for 12 months after the death of her husband, at which point they have the freedom to choose. This was likely the case to allow for the widows to have time to think and not make any rash decisions which may have led to relationships or commitments. A prospective husband had to offer his wife a valuable gift called the morgengifu, a “morning-gift,” which consisted of paying money or giving land for the ladies’ hand in marriage. This was paid to her directly and she had the right to do with it as she pleased. It is made clear that the marriage finances were held by both man and woman. A woman was free to leave a marriage, keeping in mind the only times divorce was documented was in cases of adultery; and if the woman did leave and take the children, she was entitled to half the property. These gifts were substantial sums and generally property.Carol Hough (1999) The gifts given by the groom were sometimes viewed as a sale of the bride, when, in actuality, it was to safeguard her interests and add security.  Sexual mores  According to the church sexual desires were evil and sinful, thus appeared as so; therefore women were not to enjoy sex. Many times sex was not gentle, because it was not meant to please the woman. When it came to paying for sex with a woman belonging to the King she would have cost roughly 30 shillings, while a commoner only 6 shillings.Shari Horner (2004) The transfer of money for sex shows that there was prostitution, although it is not clearly stated whether the women condoned the act or not, and this issue is still up for debate; what is known is that there was a sex trade in some form. The fact that rape of a slave was more expensive than seduction of a free woman shows how rape was viewed so negatively in society, although the law protected women against both actions. Laws of Ælfred go into great detail regarding laws about sexual assaults. An example of the law committed by a man was King Æthebald of Mercia who was punished for numerous reasons, including violating holy nuns who were virgins consecrated to God. When compensation was paid a free woman, ceorl or ranked above, she collected the money directly, and the money for slaves went to their owner. It is also unclear as to whether the wife or husband received the money for their servants.Carol Hough (1999) Rape as a topic is important because it relates to gender relations, class status, property rights, judicial customs, female agency, religious virtues of integrity of the body and representation of all of these in a society. Sexual assaults were greatly penalized whether it was a slave or free woman. Burials suggest that a raped body was unceremonious.Dawn Hadley (2004) A few documents suggest that some men of this era applauded other men who beat their wives and that some men even thought that a wife should be beaten regularly; this may have been condoned by clergy. Even though there were laws protecting women that had been raped, sometimes the acts went unpunished for lack of information or time. The victim herself may not have told anyone until many years after, or no one really took an interest in the crime if the victim was of the serving class. Sex and rape were also found in literature. There are executed and threatened acts of violent sexual assaults mentioned in some literature and legal texts;Shari Horner (2004) an example is the homily of Wulfstan, a text in which he wrote about women being raped at the hands of the Vikings.  Laws  The written law only represents a portion of the laws that impacted the lives of women; therefore they only reflect partial views of what actually happened.Mary P Richards and B. Jane Stanfield. (1990) Despite what the churches doctrines taught, women were considered to be a member of the state and their rights were protected, regardless of their status as maiden, widow or wife. Women were classed as oath worthy and could appear as grantors, grantees and witnesses of charters.Carol Hough (1999) Women were held responsible and accountable under the law for their activity, although were not held accountable for any criminal activity that her husband did, unless she was a willing accessory to the crime. Along with being law abiding, they received appropriate compensation for crimes that were committed against them, and the compensation was paid directly to them. Wills Women had property rights and many landowners were women.Carol Hough (1999) They were able to bequeath land, as shown in numerous wills. Leaving property by means of a will was not restricted to kin; it could also be left to servants, religious figures, and churches. Documents of wills and charters show that women owned estates, by virtue of grant, will, or inheritance, and that they were seen roughly equal in the common life of the countryside. Evidence in these documents shows no preference to daughters or sons as heirs.Carol Hough (1999) Ceorl women and others of high rank were responsible for their homes.Hough, Carol. \\"Women.\\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England. Ed. Lapidge et al. 1999. 485-487. Some of the items that women would commonly receive via trust or inheritance were real property estates, slaves, livestock, household furnishings, clothing, jewels, and books. Items such as table clothes, bed sheets, and wall hangings were considered women's property because women made them.  Health  Anglo-Saxons had warnings for pregnant women, including avoiding foods that were too salty or sweet, pork, and other fatty foods. They were also told to abstain from strong alcohol and too much drink and to avoid travel on horseback. If a woman were to stop menstruating supposedly due to a lack of nutrients and was not pregnant, she was to take hot baths, drink hot herb teas, and dress warmly.

Damselfish are abundant in coral reef environments. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists this fish as being of “least concern”. The species is exploited on a minor scale, for fisheries and the aquarium trade. It may be threatened by the invasive lionfish. Adult and young adult damselfish differ significantly in terms of body color. The difference was so stark that researchers believed the adult and young adult forms were two distinct species. Adults are brown with a yellow caudal fin. Young adults are violet with blue spots in their back and transparent caudal fins.  Reproduction  The spawning cycle of the yellowtail damselfish starts at sunrise and lasts approximately 1 hour after male damselfish have prepared nests on dead coral surfaces. Their eggs are demersal, adhering to the substrate where males guard and aerate them. Hatching occurs the morning of the 6th day of incubation. Reproductive activity is highest during the lunar period between full and new moon. At those points in the lunar cycle, the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon are very high resulting in spring tides.  Feeding habits  In regards to feeding habits, adults typically graze on algae while juveniles are carnivorous. M. chrysurus is omnivorous with a gradual change in feeding habits throughout development. This change in diet is related to the distribution of adult and young adult damselfish. Gut content analysis of yellowtail damselfish shows a change is food ingested from young adulthood to adulthood. Young adults primarily feed on animal-like nematocysts and zooxanthellae. Adults tend to tend to be more selective in their feeding habits, eating blue-green algae called cyanophytes. However, if there is an abundance of another food source available those are likely to be ingested by the species. = Clutch cannibalism = Clutch cannibalism occurs when a parent consumes its brood. Total clutch cannibalism by parental males has been observed in yellowtail damselfish directly and by analysis of gut contents. There are several working hypotheses as to why this behavior has been conserved. It is hypothesized that the decision to stop providing care could be to reallocate time and energy to attract more mates and thus increase lifetime reproductive success. Another possible reason is to increase growth rate or survival of parental damselfish in poorer condition. The patterns of clutch loss are related to size of the brood. There is a significant tendency for smaller clutches to disappear. Most of the clutches that disappear in M. chrysurus are young, first day clutches. Researchers have not found this pattern of loss to be attributed to reproductive activity.  Cohabitation and interspecies competition  There is interspecific overlap of feeding areas of M. chrysurus and two other damselfish species—Stegastes dorsopunicans and Stegastes planifrons. All three cohabitants consume the same benthic microalgae and have the same feeding cycles. In terms of defending the feeding grounds from intruders, studies have shown that M. chrysurus is less competent than Stegastes spp. at inhibiting intruders. However, yellowtail damselfish have a competitive advantage because of their size. M. chrysurus are aggressive toward their cohabitants, using their size-based dominance to obtain food.

Description The adult threespot damselfish is a brownish-grey, bony fish with a dusky yellow sheen and a large black spot at the base of the pectoral fins. It grows to 13 cm in length. The large dorsal fin has 12 spines and 15-17 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and 13-14 soft rays. Neither the pectoral nor pelvic fins have spines.Stegastes planifrons (Cuvier, 1830) Fishbase. Retrieved 2011-12-28. Juveniles are a much brighter yellow. They have a few tiny blue spots on the head and upper body, including one on the upper iris. They have three distinctive black spots, one at the junction between the dorsal fin spines and the soft rays, one dorsally on the caudal peduncle, and a third smaller one just above the base of the pectoral fins. These tend to have a faint blue rim, and the pectoral spot is absent in very young juveniles, becoming more prominent as the juvenile grows.Pomacentridae: Stegastes planifrons Larvae of coral reef fishes. Retrieved 2011-12-28. Distribution and habitat The threespot damselfish is found down to about in the western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Florida through the Caribbean Sea to the Bahamas. It is a demersal fish, and its favoured habitats are inshore and offshore coral reefs. It is often found among staghorn coral and at night may be found in caves. Biology Threespot damselfish feed mainly on seaweed, but also eat copepods, gastropod molluscs and their eggs, hydroids, marine worms, and sponges. Adults vigorously maintain large territories, chasing away and nipping intruders, including humans. A male and female will form a breeding pair. The female lays eggs which stick to objects on the seabed, and the male guards these and oxygenates them by fanning them with its fins.

His parents were first cousins and thus Aristobulus was a grandson to Herod the Great. When growing up, he was educated along with his eldest brothers, Agrippa I and Herod of Chalcis in Rome, along with future Roman Emperor Claudius. Claudius and Aristobulus became friends and he became in high favor with the future emperor. Claudius and Aristobulus had sent letters to each other. Aristobulus lived at enmity with Agrippa I. Aristobulus denounced Agrippa I and forced him to leave from the protection of Flaccus, the Proconsul of Syria. Agrippa I was charged with bribing the Damascenes to support their cause with the Proconsul against the Sidonians. Aristobulus married Iotapa, a Syrian Princess from the Royal family of Emesa and daughter of King Sampsiceramus II and Queen Iotapa who ruled Emesa from 14-42. This marriage for Aristobulus was a promising marriage in dynastic terms. Iotapa and Aristobulus chose to live as private citizens in the Middle East. Iotapa and Aristobulus had a daughter called Iotapa, who was deaf and mute. Apart from their daughter, they had no further descendants. In the reign of Emperor Caligula 37-41, Aristobulus had opposed the emperor in setting up statues of himself in the Temple in Jerusalem. He survived his brother Agrippa I, who died in 44.

Described in The Sydney Morning Herald as a \\"political witch hunt\\", the police were searching for copies of approximately 80 documents, although no evidence was found. Dorling published an account of the raid and its context in February 2012. After leaving Laurie Brereton's office following the 2001 Federal election, Dorling spent two years (2002-2003) working as an advisor to Daryl Melham, the Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs, a role in which he contributed to the Labor Party's approach to counter-terrorism legislation introduced by Prime Minister John Howard's Government following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. Dorling was then briefly engaged in the Tasmanian Premier's department in 2003 before moving to the Australian Capital Territory's Chief Minister's department, where he worked as a Senior Manager in the Cabinet Office until 2008. Post–politics After leaving the Chief Minister's Department, Dorling joined The Canberra Times and worked there as National Affairs Correspondent until late 2010. He then worked as a Senior Writer for The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald until June 2015. Dorling was again caught up in controversy when the Australian Federal Police raided Dorling's home on 23 September 2008, after he quoted from classified briefing papers intended for the Australian Minister for Defence, Joel Fitzgibbon. Police reportedly seized \\"several documents\\" as a result of their search; however no further action followed the raid. Together with Richard Baker and Nick McKenzie of The Age , Dorling published in 2009 and 2010 a series of articles in Canberra Times, The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald relating to Fitzgibbon's relationship with Chinese-Australian businesswoman Helen Liu. Fitzgibbon later resigned from the Defence portfolio. While working for Fairfax Media he wrote mainly on national security issues and international affairs. He revealed the role of the United States - Australian Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap in providing signals intelligence support for United States drone strikes and other military operations. In late 2010 and 2011 Dorling was responsible for the publication in Australia of the US Embassy cables obtained by Wikileaks. While working as a journalist Dorling received Melbourne Press Club Quill Awards and was shortlisted for the Walkley Award for Excellence in Journalism. Following his work with The Age and Sydney Morning Herald, Dorling contributed to The Saturday Paper in 2015 with articles on United States espionage against Japan and Saudi influence in Australia. In the first half of 2017 Dorling produced a series of research papers on Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party that were published by The Australia Institute. Dorling has also served as a political adviser to South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon and Senator Rex Patrick. In June 2017 Dorling briefly returned to journalism and with Fairfax Media colleagues Baker and McKenzie published in The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald a further expose of Helen's Liu's links with Chinese military intelligence officer Liu Chaoying who had been identified as a significant figure in the 1996 United States 'Chinagate' political funding scandal.

Manga Times has a weekly circulation of about 380,000. Weekly Manga Times became known as one of the big three weekly manga magazines along with Weekly Manga Goraku, published by Nihon Bungeisha, and Manga Sunday, published by Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha. From 1969 until 1980, the magazine advertised on the outfield fence at Meiji Jingu Stadium. A one-panel manga by Sunao Hari titled Weekend Egao was published on the table of contents page until the spring of 2008 when it was moved to the last page. Additionally, the interior paper was changed to use a higher quality white paper rather than the standard lower grade newsprint. The cover of Weekly Manga Times has featured a realistic painting of a young woman on every issue. The cover artist since the April 1970 issue has been Keizō Tsukamoto, for which he won a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for \\"the world's longest continuous career illustrating one magazine\\". Weekly Manga Times also featured a series titled .

You're sent from heaven And I know your worth. You've made a heaven For me here on earth. And the angels grew lonely Took you because they were lonely I'm lonely too, Sonny Boy. Eddie Fisher Singer Eddie Fisher was always called \\"Sonny Boy\\" by his family because of the popularity of this song, which was recorded the same year as Fisher's birth. In his autobiography, Fisher wrote that even after he was married to Elizabeth Taylor in 1959, earning $40,000 a week performing in Las Vegas, spending time with Frank Sinatra and Rocky Marciano, and had songs at the top of the charts, his family still called him \\"Sonny Boy\\". Notable recordings and performances In 1929, the song was performed by Bosko in the pilot film Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid, an early attempt at creating an animated cartoon with spoken dialogue. Arild Andresen, piano with guitar and bass recorded it in Oslo on March 11, 1955 as the first melody of the medley \\"Klaver-Cocktail Nr. 4\\" along with \\"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\\" and \\"Ain't Misbehavin'. The medley was released on the 78 rpm record His Master's Voice A.L. 3514\\\\. Paul Robeson recorded this song on a 78 rpm record. The song has also been recorded by The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra with vocalist Ruth Brown, Ruth Etting, The Andrews Sisters, Petula Clark, Mandy Patinkin, John McCormack, Richard Tauber, Franz Völker and Rudolf Schock. Pesach Burstein recorded a Yiddish version (translation by L. Wolfe Gilbert). The song is used as a major plot point in the short story Jeeves and the Song of Songs by P. G. Wodehouse (originally published 1929), included in the collection Very Good, Jeeves (1930). The story was dramatised as the second episode of season 1 of the British TV series Jeeves and Wooster, \\"Tuppy and the Terrier\\", where is it performed by Hugh Laurie as the character Bertie Wooster and then by Constance Novis as the character Cora Bellinger. Danny Thomas performed the song at Arnold's as Howard Cunninghams father Cap Cunningham in the 1977 Happy Days fifth season episode \\"Grandpas Visit\\". Ken Dodd performed the song as part of his ventriloquist's act with his puppet Dicky Mint during his performance on the LWT series An Audience With... The song was performed by one of the entrants at Talent Trek on Phoenix Nights. The song \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" by The Smiths includes references to the song. According to 1986 British TV documentary \\"The Real Al Jolson Story,\\" \\"Sonny Boy\\" was written in a single sitting in a hotel room in Atlantic City as a joke. Various renditions of the song are used as a leitmotif in the 1990 psychological horror film Jacob's Ladder, indicating protagonist Jacob's love for his late son Gabe. The film notably omits the last verse, which relates the narrator's loss in kind, perhaps as an artistic choice. The song title is the title of a Dutch book and movie about a Surinamese/Dutch family and their lives leading up to and in the second World War. The little boy's nickname is Sonny Boy after this song, which was popular when he was born.

It has an installed generation capacity of 300 gigawatts, and produces 1,200 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year for its 280 million customers. The system spans eight time zones. History The creation of the unified power system started in 1956 by interconnecting the power systems of Center and Middle Volga. By 1978, the unified power system included all of the Soviet Union, excluding Central Asia. In addition, in 1979–1993 the power systems of Poland, German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, now part of the synchronous grid of Continental Europe (ENTSO-E), operated synchronously with the Unified Power System of USSR. Central Asian countries (excluding Turkmenistan) were included to the integrated system in 2001. In 2009, Uzbekistan disconnected from the system resulting also in the disconnection of Tajikistan. UPS The Russian portion of the interconnection is known as Unified Power System of Russia (UPS) () and includes six regional transmission operators: ECO Center, ECO South, ECO North-West, ECO Middle Volga, ECO Urals and ECO Siberia. ECO East operates in isolation from UPS of Russia. UPS of Russia came into existence as a result of Russian Federation Decision #526 dated 11 July 2001 \\"On the Restructuring of the Russian Federation United Energy System\\". Up until 1 July 2008 RAO UES operated UPS. It is currently being operated by the Federal Grid Company (FGC UES) of Russia. IPS The Integrated Power System (IPS). portion of the network includes the national networks of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Moldova and Mongolia. Interconnections with other systems IPS/UPS is synchronously interconnected with the Baltic countries. In addition, it has an interlink to the Nordic system via a back to back High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) connection in Finland with a capacity of 1420 megawatts. (See \\"Operation of Power Systems\\" link for title page and table of contents.) Russia and the EU are considering unifying the IPS/UPS network with the ENTSO-E to form a single synchronous super grid spanning 13 time zones. There is also a proposal to interconnect the Russian grid to China and other Asian systems with HVDC links as part of an Asian Super Grid.

Boyce and Hart had written many of The Monkees' biggest hits such as \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\" and \\"(Theme from) The Monkees\\". The group existed only for a short time in 1976, recording one eponymous album, also entitled Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart. Background The group was called Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart because they were legally prohibited from using the name \\"The Monkees.\\" Former Monkees members Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork, both of whom had left the group before their final album, Changes (1970), were also invited to join the group, but both declined. Dolenz and Jones had been the only two members of the Monkees to contribute to Changes. As such, and because of Boyce and Hart's close songwriting ties to the Monkees, several publications, such as Allmusic, consider Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart to be a de facto Monkees reunion album, without the rights to the Monkees name. Most of the musicians that appear on the album were featured on Monkees albums in the past. A majority of the vocals are performed by Dolenz and Jones, with Boyce and Hart contributing backing vocals and the occasional lead vocal, such as Hart's on \\"I Love You (And I'm Glad That I Said It)\\".

The book draws on the fields of sociology, political science, economics, criminology, and legal studies. The authors argue that the inequalities which prevail in America today, especially with regard to wages, income, and access to housing and health care, are the effects of either cultural or individual failures. The book provides an alternative explanation: that racism—particularly institutionalized racism—is as much a problem in America as in earlier times. Such inequalities continue to exist in the labor market, the welfare state, the criminal justice system, and schools and universities. The book recounts the history of advancement among black Americans since the 1960s, and current anti-discrimination policies, but advocates new policies for increased racial equality in a post-affirmative action world.

He was a five-term mayor of Joliet, Illinois, the fourth largest municipality in the state after Chicago, Aurora, and Rockford. He was last elected in April 2007. Prior to his first election, he served in the United States Navy and in the Joliet Police Department. He finished as the first runner-up in the Joliet City Council election of 1989, but when a sitting councilwoman died a few months after the election he was passed over several times for the nomination. This was controversial as the nomination is customarily given to the runner-up in the most recent election. He returned to elective politics to defeat the mayor, who did not nominate him in the subsequent election in 1991. In his time in office, Joliet changed from an economy of a prison town with declining population to a fast-growing entertainment and tourism economy, focused on riverboat casinos. Residential and commercial construction increased and racing tracks, a baseball stadium, and several civic works developed as a result of the booming economy. Personal life Schultz was born on July 4, 1933 and raised in Joliet. He attended parochial schools in the city, and was an altar boy. Schultz was a graduate of Joliet Catholic High School. After high school, he served four years in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He then worked for the Joliet Police Department for 29 years before being elected mayor in 1991. Schultz and his wife were married on November 6, 1954 at the Cathedral of St. Raymond in Joliet. As of his 50th wedding anniversary in 2004, Schultz had five children and eight grandchildren. On November 16, 1993 Schultz had a laryngectomy after having had vocal chord tumors removed the previous May. He lost his voice for a period before regaining it after several months of home recuperation with the aid of a voice prosthesis that was inserted into a neck valve. Schultz suffered congestive heart failure on November 14, 2011, which required hospital care. He died on November 26, 2011, aged 78. Political career =Election history= City Council Schultz ran for the election to the Joliet City Council in the spring 1989 municipal elections. He advanced from the February 28, 1989 primary election to the general election in what the Chicago Tribune described as a surprisingly strong showing, but finished fourth in the six-way April 4 general election for three seats. In August 1989, Joliet Councilwoman Margaret Short died with two years remaining in her term and Joliet Mayor Charles Connor had the responsibility of nominating a replacement for consideration by the remaining councilmen. Rather than following the custom of nominating the first runner-up in the most recent council election (Schultz in this case), Connor nominated a political ally. The council did not support the nomination and after some delay she withdrew on September 19. When Connor's second nomination was again not one of the runners-up, it was again defeated, which led to the council enacting legislation to strip the mayor of his power to nominate councilmen. On October 17, Connor became the first Joliet mayor since the mid-1970s to refuse to sign legislation passed by the Joliet City Council. On November 21, there was unanimous agreement on a compromise candidate who was also not one of the runners-up. Mayor At the time of the non-partisan February 26, 1991 mayoral primary election, the Chicago Tribune described Joliet as suffering from a stagnant economy and sagging population. Between 1980 and 1990 the population had declined to 76,836 from 77,956, according to the United States Census Bureau. Connor was challenged by three candidates, including Schultz. Schultz narrowly won the primary election by a 2,709-2,545 (38%-36%) margin over Connor, but both candidates advanced to the April general election since they finished first and second in the primary. On April 2, Schultz defeated Connor by a 6,081-5,534 margin. Schultz was approved in his re-election bids. In 1995, he earned 67 percent of the vote in the primary election and 68 percent in the general election. He was unopposed in 1999. In 2003, he became the first four-term mayor for Joliet, which was incorporated in 1852, by taking 83% of the vote in a four-way contest. In 2007, he earned 73% of the vote in a three-way contest. He did not run in the 2011 election, and was succeeded by Thomas Giarrante. =Service= In January 1990, the Illinois legislature passed two bills that permitted gambling along the Mississippi, Illinois, and Des Plaines Rivers. but gambling did not commence in Joliet until June 17, 1992. In January 1993 Schultz described Joliet as \\"the riverboat-gambling capital of the world\\". In 1995 Joliet officials expected the town to be debt free by 2001 with Schultz described the sizable gambling industry revenues as \\"manna from Heaven\\" and encouraged other cities to try legalized gambling. Between 1993 and 1997 Schultz received US$1,500 in gambling-related political contributions. During the 1990s, Joliet was one of the fastest-growing cities in the state, and in 2000 its residential and commercial construction were at record-setting levels, according to Schultz. Schultz also credited gambling revenues with having enabled the city to halt tax increases for a decade and to build a new police station and three new firehouses. In 1999, the Joliet City Council approved the construction of the Chicagoland Speedway on of land next to the Route 66 Raceway. Between 2000 and 2002 Joliet was the tenth fastest-growing city in the United States. Under Schultz, the city ended nearly 150 years as a prison town with the closure of the Joliet Correctional Center and focused its economy on entertainment and tourism. In the early 1990s the city annexed for the construction of the Empress Riverboat Casino complex. In 1999, the city annexed for the construction of the Chicagoland Speedway, which when combined with the Route 66 Raceway made Joliet the only racing facility host in the United States capable of hosting races from each major category in professional auto racing. In 2001, the city acquired 12 parcels totaling through expedited condemnations to build Silver Cross Field. In 2005, the city annexed to provide a corridor for commercial and residential growth. As of the July 1, 2007 United States Census Bureau population estimates, Joliet had a population of 144,316. Thus, Schultz served as mayor for a city that ranked as the 162nd largest incorporated municipality in the United States and the fourth largest in the state of Illinois. Silver Cross Field, which was built in 2002 to host the Joliet Jackhammers of the Northern League is located at 1 Mayor Art Schultz Drive. By 2007, prospects of continued growth necessitated that Joliet agree on borders with the neighboring municipality of Oswego and that it consider future borders with others.

Frequently involved with party, bar or beach area fights, the group has maintained a feeling of aversion toward residents of the San Fernando Valley region, as well as other outsiders who find their way into Malibu for recreation or leisure. Currently, they are considered to be an unorganized group of an estimated 10 to 15 people, who are often criticized by former MLO members for their attacks on innocent people, rather than operating on the original goals of the organization.  Origins  Initially established in the 1960s by a group of Malibu surfers, the group sought to do two things; stop the San Fernando Valley surfers from using their beaches (which, at the time, were private), and protect students of Malibu who were the minority in high schools at the time (because Malibu High School had not yet been constructed). The group began to graffiti the letters \\"MLO\\", which eventually became the name by which the group was referenced, and Malibu Locals Only was born.  Current activity  Today, the gang has been responsible for multiple instances of brutality. The gang has also been involved in many encounters with Pepperdine University students, frequently at the Malibu Inn. Despite the fact that the Malibu Locals Only gang has met the criteria of a criminal gang, as defined by the STEP (Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention) Act passed by the California state legislature, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (the agency contracted by the city of Malibu to perform law enforcement duties) has continued to deny that the group is a criminal gang. This has upset many people, as the organization has continued their criminal activity, affecting outsiders visiting the seaside city.

He donated vast sums of money to the Greek state, as well as to educational, cultural and humanitarian institutions of the Greek communities in Greece and the Ottoman ruled Greek world. Life He was born in a Greek family in Ottoman Korce, present-day southern Albania (Northern Epirus). Though his father Georgios Pangas was also a notable merchant and philanthropist, Ioannis Pangas made his own fortune. He initially moved to Thebes and then to Chalkis. At 1833 in order to expand his professional activities, he moved to Cairo (Egypt) and then Romania. At a mature age he settled in Athens. Because of his character and hard-working nature he managed to make a fortune. Benefactory deeds and legacy In 1889–88 he donated a significant amount of money for the maintenance and expansion of the Greek schools in his home city Korce, where he also established new libraries and donated a huge amount of educational material at his personal expense. Thus, he became one of the main contributors of the Lasso fund, a community fund that supported the foundation and support of Greek cultural institutions in Korce. The Greek Gymnasium of his home town was named Bangas Gymnasium after him. While living in Athens, he built a luxurious mansion, designed by the German architect Ernst Ziller, at the center of the Greek capital (on Omonoia square) as well as a second manor, also designed by Ziller, adjacent to his home. On 16 August 1889, Pangas donated to the Greek state his fortune and all of his possessions, as an act of philanthropy to aid the rebuilding of Athens and the growth of the new Greek state. He retained only 1,000 drachmas per month in order to lead a decent life. This form of benefaction was quite unusual, to offer to donate one's fortune while living rather than upon death. Greek prime minister Charilaos Trikoupis personally noted the significance of Pangas's philanthropy. Pangas's mansion and adjacent manor still stand at Omonoia square. The former operated for many years as the Hotel Alexander the Great. The latter came to be known as the \\"Pangeion\\" or \\"Bangeion\\" or \\"Baggeion\\" () and has been used to house universities and other educational institutions.

The music was composed by Vidyasagar.The movie Chirakodinja Kinavukal released on 2015 is a spin-off to this film. Plot Shankar Das (Mammootty) is a rich businessman who returns to his native village in Alappuzha. No one in the village is aware of his past. During his childhood he was a servant of the local feudal lord Chatothu Panickar. He left the job after getting severely punished for kissing the lord's young daughter. He fled to Mumbai and there he became a successful businessman. Now he has returned to his native village incognito. He is a very boastful man and revels in the praises showered on him by the sycophants. He reveals his identity to Ambujakshan, who is his childhood friend and an aspiring writer. He also confides in him his interest for Panicker's daughter Anuradha, who was his childhood infatuation. Ambujakshan succeeds in convincing Shankar to produce a film by telling him that it would help him to earn the respect of the villagers and win over Anuradha. Thus the production of the film starts under the direction of Sharath, who is the love interest of Anuradha. Shankar renders unsolicited financial help to Panicker's family. But, Shankar later realizes about the love developing between Anuradha and Sharath the film director and that leads to a pause on the film's production. Later, Shankar proposes marriage to Anuradha, which she declines. However, the family, which is indebted to him, coerces her to marry him. Anuradha, who is infuriated, decides that she will not present herself as a virgin before Shankar and makes love with Sharath. After the marriage she learns from Shankar that Sharath had accepted money from him for not creating any trouble for their marriage. This causes another heartbreak for her and she confesses about her relationship with Sharath to Shankar. In the end Shankar forgives Anuradha and their marital relationship resumes.

The hunting lodge was established between 1722 and 1724 by Landgrave Ernst Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt. Ernst Ludwig's purpose in establishing Wolfsgarten was to pursue his passion for hunting with dogs which he introduced into Hesse in 1709. The original building corresponded to the usual pattern for hunting seats of that era with a rectangular yard around which was grouped housing for gentlemen, the stables for the horses, and kennels for the dogs. After Ernst Ludwig's successors abandoned hunting with dogs in 1768, Wolfsgarten was abandoned until the 1830s when the grand ducal family began to restore and expand the property. From 1879, Wolfsgarten became a favorite country retreat for Grand Dukes Ludwig IV and his son Ernst Ludwig.

It may be prepared from chloroacetic acid and thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, or phosgene. Reactions Chloroacetyl chloride is bifunctional—the acyl chloride easily forms esters and amides, while the other end of the molecule is able to form other linkages, e.g. with amines. The use of chloroacetyl chloride in the synthesis of lidocaine is illustrative: :450px Applications The major use of chloroacetyl chloride is as an intermediate in the production of herbicides in the chloroacetanilide family including metolachlor, acetochlor, alachlor and butachlor; an estimated 100 million pounds are used annually. Some chloroacetyl chloride is also used to produce phenacyl chloride, another chemical intermediate, also used as a tear gas. Phenacyl chloride is synthesized in a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene, with an aluminium chloride catalyst: :450px Safety Like other acyl chlorides, reaction with other protic compounds such as amines, alcohols, and water generates hydrochloric acid, making it a lachrymator.

Early life Gatland was born Maria McGuire, to a middle-class family, and lived in the suburb of Churchtown, Dublin. She was one of four siblings (two brothers and a sister). She was educated at St. Anne's School and then University College Dublin, where she studied English language and literature. IRA involvement McGuire became a member of the Provisional IRA in the early 1970s. She accompanied Dáithí Ó Conaill (a leader of the Republican movement, also known as David O'Connell) to the European continent on an arms buying expedition. The expedition came to nothing because it was reported in the British press, and Ó Conaill and McGuire abandoned the mission. She and Ó Conaill had an affair during this trip, although he was married. She, Ó Conaill, and Ó Conaill's wife had a difficult discussion about the issues involved shortly after they returned to Ireland.McGuire, Maria (1973) To Take Arms: A Year in the Provisional IRA, Macmillan. Provisional IRA bomb attacks in Belfast, on 21 July 1972 (known as Bloody Friday) killed seven civilians and two soldiers, and left 130 injured. McGuire subsequently decided to leave the Provisional IRA. She was told by the British authorities that if she did so she would receive Special Branch protection. In the late summer of 1972 she appeared in London and wrote a series of articles for The Observer, went into hiding, and wrote a book about her experiences in the organisation called To Take Arms: A Year in the Provisional IRA which was published in 1973.

Political career In 2002, Maria Gatland was elected as a member of the Conservative Party to Croydon Council as a councillor for Croham ward and in 2006 became Croydon's cabinet member for education. She says that she never hid her IRA past. When the Conservative Party found out about her past she stepped down as a council cabinet member in early December 2008. At the same time Gatland was suspended by the party, but was later accepted back to the Tory fold. She was subsequently re-elected as a councillor in the 2010 and 2014 local elections.

Fuel can be changed while the reactor is in operation, improving grid and fuel efficiency.NIKIET - Department of Pressure- Tube Power Reactors Vertical injectors promote a natural convective flow of the light water primary circuit fluid through inlined channels in the reactor core. Graphite blocks in the reactor core serve as a neutron moderator.MULTILOOP PRESSURE TUBE POWER REACTORS (MKER) – CONSOLIDATION OF EXPERTISE IN DESIGN OF DOMESTIC PRESSURE TUBE REACTORS There are three different types of MKER: the MKER-800, MKER-1000 and MKER-1500. No MKER of any type has yet been completed.LAES - The proposed NPP design meets the following requirements  MKER-800  The MKER-800 has an electrical generation capacity of 800 MW. An automated process control system for the MKER-800 is under development in a joint project of Westinghouse and NIKIET.LAES - Main contractors and suppliers Plans for the MKER-800 remain unfinished. Four MKER-800 units were originally planned for the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant.Bellona - Statistics from Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant  MKER-1000  The MKER-1000 has a thermal power output of 2845 MWth and an electrical output of 1,000 MW. There are four circuits and 1,832 fuel elements in the reactor core. Total fissile material in the reactor is 163 tonnes. Overall responsibility for construction of the MKER design is held by Northern Construction Administration. Major assemblies are produced by the Izhorsky Zavod in Saint Petersburg, and the turbine supplier is the Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod. Main building and reactor containment is designed by Atomenergoproekt. The MKER is intended to directly substitute for existing RBMK plants producing heat, electricity and medical isotopes. The reactor building of the MKER consists of a dual containment structure with an inner diameter of 27.75 meters. An inner liner intended to prevent leakage of radioactive material into the atmosphere can withstand internal pressures of 2.5 bar. Protection from external damage is provided by an outer concrete wall. The two structures are independent and separated physically from one another on a common foundation. Damage from an earthquake of M_\\\\mathrm{L} 8 would be contained by this structure.LAES - The proposed NPP design meets the following requirements LAES - The MKER-1000 reactor unit incorporates as follows Automatic control is an integral part of the MKER design. Located between the reactor building and the turbine hall, the control room oversees the automatic control system and various plant safety systems. It occupies a protected central location, minimizing possibility of damage or compromise. The MKER-1000 core includes the pressure tube reactor and eight coolant injector pumps. There are multiple coolant loops with 16 independent circuits, two circuits sharing a pump each.LAES - The MKER-1000 reactor unit incorporates as follows From an overall thermal capacity of 3,000 MWth electrical generation of 1,000 MW plus an additional 130 MW of thermal energy for building heat can be obtained. The design specified turbine is a type K-1000-6, 1 / 3000 at 3000 rpm with an alternator of type TZV-1100-2UZ. Both evaporative cooling and open cycle cooling variations have been proposed. Low- enriched uranium dioxide fuel with concentrations of 2.0 to 2.4% U-235 equivalence is specified. Fuel is changed using a remote-controlled crane and spent fuel rods would spend up to five years in a cooling pond located in the reactor hall before further processing. The continuous refuelling cycle brings a fuel burnup benefit; individual rods can be left longer in the reactor instead of being swapped en masse as required in most PWR designs.  MKER-1500  A further proposed development of the MKER is the MKER-1500 with a corresponding electrical generation capacity of 1500 MW. Transfer of heat from the reactor core has been improved in the new design, with primary loops divided into four independent circuits. The diameter of the coolant tubes is expanded to 600 mm and injector pump configuration is changed. Cooling circuits are relocated below the containment. The MKER-1500 was also proposed for the Leningrad nuclear power plant.THE PRESSURE-TUBE LINE IN RUSSIAN NUCLEAR ENGINEERING  References   Other links  * RBMK * Nuclear power in Russia Nuclear power reactor types Science and technology in Russia Nuclear energy in Russia ru:РБМК#МКЭР (современные проекты) ","title":"MKER"},{"id":"20591863","text":"The 2009 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team was the third under head coach Tim Brewster.

The idea of gnomic literature dates back to Aristotle, who defined a gnome as \\"A statement not relating to particulars, as e.g. the character of Iphicrates, but to universals; yet not to all universals indiscriminately, as e.g. that straight is the opposite of crooked, but to all such as are the objects of (human) action and are to be chosen or avoided in our doings\\".Greenfield and Evert, pp. 338–339. Since the material in \\"Maxims I\\" is sententious in its character, it is regarded as gnomic poetry as opposed to a collection of proverbs or merely wise sayings. \\"Maxims I\\" is divided into three sections. The opening section begins with a dialogue in which the writer espouses a wisdom contest found in other Old English texts. The middle section discusses natural phenomena such as frost and the seasons, as well as containing a passage about a man's wife welcoming him home from a long journey. The final section contains a comparison of Woden, the creator of idols, to the god of Christianity, who formed the earth and everything in it. \\"Woden fashioned idols, the Ruler of all fashioned heaven and the spacious skies\\".Bradley, p. 349. This section also consists of reflections of those who have been exiled, the comfort of song, and the need for courage in daily life. \\"Maxims II\\" Stanley Greenfield and Richard Evert, in their article \\"Maxims II: Gnome and Poem\\" characterize the poem \\"Maxims II\\" as possessing \\"a rambling style which covers a great deal of ground, yet never reaches any particular goal\\".Greenfield and Evert, p. 338. Some view \\"Maxims II\\" as being similar to how a compilation of poetry is written and edited. For example, Henk Aertsen and Rolf Bremmer, in their Companion to Old English Poetry, state, \\"lack of unity characterizes these lines\\".Aertsen & Bremmer, p. 111. Still other critics disagree. A. P. M. Orchard in Medieval England: an Encyclopedia comments, \\"It can be argued that each maxim is implicitly linked to its neighbor and that, far from being a haphazard list of commonplaces, \\"Maxims II\\" (like \\"Maxims I\\") has a coherent organic structure”.Orchard, p. 504. It is widely believed that \\"Maxims II\\" was influenced by the monks who copied it, since it contains gnomes of a religious nature. \\"Maxims II\\" states, \\"The shape of the future is obscure and unknowable; the Lord alone knows it, the Redeeming Father\\".Bradley, p. 515. Compared with the Old Testament proverb, \\"Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth\\" (Proverbs 27:1, Old Testament, NIV), one can readily see the influence of Christianity on the poem. When reading \\"Maxims II\\", the organisation and themes of the poem are not readily visible. For example, Paul Cavill writes that the argument of the apparent disjointedness of the poem is important because the poet pits Christ and Fate against each other, thus illustrating the traditional nature and remains of pagan belief in the poetry. Cavill cites the gnomes in \\"Maxims II\\", \\"... the powers of Christ are great, fate is strongest\\".Cavill, p. 133. However, most experts believe that the pagan material in the poems has been thoroughly worked over by their Christian redactors. Similarities between \\"Maxims I\\" and \\"Maxims II\\" In \\"Maxims I\\", the Old English verbs biþ (implying an actual and ongoing state of being) and sceal (stating what ought to be the case) are used repeatedly throughout the first and second sections. Byþ and sceal are an important aspect of the Maxims II. Many people who study these poems and the themes that exist between both the Maxims I and the Maxims II poems discuss this topic. These words are translated for byþ as “be” and for sceal as “shall”. This, however, causes an issue because these translations are not always helpful in context. Marie Nelson suggests that the verb sceal can also be translated to “shall be”, which then raises the “question of whether futurity or necessity is implied.” Nelson sees that the problem may cause an issue in the meaning of the translation and may confuse the reader. As it remains, the two words are most clearly understood as \\"what is\\" and \\"what should be.\\" (M. Nelson, ' \\"Is\\" and \\"Ought\\" in the Exeter Book Maxims', Southern Folklore Quarterly 45 (1981), 109-21) The poem combines observations about the world with small stories and moral statements. \\"Maxims II\\" does much the same. These poems are part of the genre known as wisdom literature, found in many different cultures, and can also be compared to the method used by Christ by using everyday situations to explain deeper truths. The influence of the Christian monks who copied it upon the traditional material in the poems may thus be seen. In addition to providing moral guidance and precepts for everyday life, both \\"Maxims\\" poems \\"organize things and people into categories, catalogue trade rules, and list things as diverse as skills, fates, and rune names\\".Cavill p. 24. As mentioned previously, the references to common occurrences in nature and society made the poems of general interest, though both poems also describe proper behaviour for the aristocracy of the day as well. The reference in \\"Maxims I\\" of \\"A king has to procure a queen with payment, with goblets and with rings\\". and in \\"Maxims II\\" the gnome \\"The king belongs in his hall, sharing out rings\\".Bradley, p. 514. are evidence of this. In addition, both poems contain themes that coincide with the most famous Old English poem Beowulf. \\"Maxims I\\" refers to Cain just as Beowulf does and contains maxims for the wife of a hero returning home from his exploits which is similar to Beowulf returning home from his adventures. Like Beowulf, \\"Maxims II\\" refers to a dragon. \\"The dragon belongs in its barrow, canny and jealous of its jewels\\".Bradley p. 513–514. The dragon was not considered a fictional animal in this period, but a real part of the natural world – like other animals that Anglo-Saxons had heard of but not seen because they lived in other parts of the world. Influence on J.R.R. Tolkien The verse in Maxims II and similar phrases in The Ruin inspired J.R.R. Tolkien the names of the tower Orthanc and the tree-men Ents in The Lord of the Rings. It is widely believed that the form of the \\"Maxims\\" poems influenced a verse recited by the Ent Treebeard in Book III, chapter iv of The Two Towers.

History A cell of the first Communist Party in the Kamnik area was established at the Cerar Inn in 1939. During the Second World War, the Partisans broke into the manor in the village on 14 January 1943 and stole a large quantity of food. After the war, much working-class housing was built in Volčji Potok. A catchment basin for local water supply was built below the village in 1967. Castle and manor Ruins of Volčji Potok Castle The overgrown foundations of Volčji Potok Castle ()Gradovi v Sloveniji: Volčji Potok II. stand east of the village on Wolf Hill (). The castle was first mentioned in written sources in 1220, but was already in ruins by the 17th century. Construction of Volčji Potok Manor ()), which stood below the hill, was begun by the Bonhomo family in the 17th century. The manor was purchased in 1882 by Ferdinand Souvan (1840–1915), who remodeled it and planted the meadow in front of it with trees. This park was expanded to 12 hectares by his son Leon Souvan (1877–1949), who planted it with domestic and exotic trees and surrounded it with a hornbeam hedge. The manor was burned by the Partisans on 13 April 1944.Gradovi v Sloveniji: Volčji Potok I. After the war, the ruins of the manor were razed and the manor chapel was converted into a restaurant. Arboretum Today, Volčji Potok is best known for its arboretum, the largest and most popular botanical garden in Slovenia. The Volčji Potok Arboretum is open from the beginning of March until the end of November. It was established in 1952 by the University of Ljubljana on what was already a well-established estate with extensive parks around a Baroque mansion that was destroyed in the Second World War.Volčji Potok Arboretum site Church Saint Oswald's Church The local church is dedicated to Saint Oswald. It features several paintings from Leopold Layer's school. The church was first mentioned in written sources in 1526 and was reworked in the 18th century.
