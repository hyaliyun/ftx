Fasti, Book III, March 15. Battus features briefly in Ovid's Fasti as the protector of Anna Perenna.  Appearance in Ovid's Fasti  After Dido's tragic death, Anna finds refuge from her brother Pygmalion on Malta, with Battus the king of the island and a wealthy host. The \\"fertile island\\" of Melite, near Cossyra, provided hospitality to Anna, with Battus saying that ‚ÄòThis land, however small, is yours.‚Äô Battus would have continued to provide sanctuary to Anna and her companions, but in the third year of her exile, Anna's brother came in her pursuit. The king hated war, as the island was a peaceable sanctuary, and asked Anna to flee for her own safety. She fled at his command, with Battus giving her a ship. = Controversy = According to Frazer, Ovid is the only source for a king named Battus on Malta. However, Dougall records the discovery of a punic inscription identifying a king Battus on a sepulcher in Malta. In fact, Dougall mentions how in 1761 an underground sepulcher was found in \\"khasam ta byn Hysae,\\" that is Bengƒßisa, in the south side of the island of Malta. The sepulcher had an inscription, made up of forty-seven letters in four lines. The characters were mostly unreadable, however the last line was agreed to state \\"hal byn bat malek,\\" which signified \\"for the son of Bat, the king.\\" The same inscription was recorded in the Vocabolario Maltese published by Mikiel Anton Vassalli in 1796. The story linking Anna Perenna with Malta can only be found in Ovid, and derivative works. Another epic poet, Silius Italicus, bypasses Anna's arrival in Malta, and places her refuge with a King Battus in the Greek colony of Cyrene, in North Africa. In both stories, Anna is seen to find safety in Battus' kingdom, with both versions having the king advise Anna to flee for another place of refuge because of Pygmalion, and in both stories Battus is represented as a rich and hospitable king. Moreover, Battus is the historical name of the first Greek king to have established a colony in Cyrene, with at least three other kings bearing that same name. The existence of King Battus on Malta, or at least the occurrence of a pre-existing tradition of a reigning Phoenician king on Malta, is the source of significant controversy in Maltese classical literature. Battus' link with Malta is usually dismissed, and it is generally accepted that he reigned over Cyrene. Busuttil (1970) singles out the parallels with Italicus' story as evidence that Ovid places King Battus on Malta purely for literary purposes. Busuttil then focuses on Ovid's indications that in his contemporary times Malta was prosperous and its agriculture fertile. Any links with Battus' kingdom, according to Busuttil, might have resulted from Malta borrowing iconography from Cyrene, most notably for its coins.

Dean founded the Manassas Industrial School for Colored Youth, which for more than four decades was the only institution of secondary education available to African American youth in Northern Virginia, and one of only two in the state without overt religious affiliation.Stephen Johnson Lewis, Undaunted Faith: The Story of Jennie Dean (memorial edition, reprinted by The Manassas Museum, 1994) Early and family life Jennie Dean was born to Charles Dean (a domestic servant) and his wife Annie, both of them African Americans born enslaved and owned by the Newman family, and later by the Cushing family. Her grandmother Mildred may have been of Native American ancestry. She had two sisters (Ella Dean and Mary Dean), both of whom married after the American Civil War, although Jennie Dean herself never married. Her sister Ella's death certificate lists Jennie's birth date as April 15, 1848, but another death certificate indicates Jennie Dean as born in 1853.Lewis p. 5 After Virginia seceded from the Union and the American Civil War began, Col. Cushing's sons joined the Confederate Army. The elder Cushing died shortly after learning one son had died in a battle near Warrenton, Virginia. Earlier, the First Battle of Manassas was fought near their home, and the Dean family stayed in their cabin and hoped to avoid the artillery shelling and crossfire. Afterward, on the master's instructions, her father and other enslaved men rescued wounded Confederate soldiers, and later buried many dead. The following year, the Second Battle of Manassas was fought on much of the same ground, since Manassas Junction was a railroad hub and Manassas Gap a key pass between coastal and the Piedmont region of Virginia. Career After the war ended, Dean received rudimentary schooling at a Manly School. Although still a teenager in 1866, she sought domestic service work in Washington, D.C., taking the train home on weekends. In Washington, she attended a Congregational church, then joined the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, as well as lived frugally. Dean sent most of her wages home, which not only helped her family buy the farm they wanted and cope with her father's death, but also allowed her sister Ella to attend the Wayland Seminary and become a teacher. Dean could see many young African Americans leave farming (and the hopelessness of sharecropping for those unable to afford a down payment for land) and move to the nearby city. She was concerned that they would become stuck in low-wage jobs, as well as succumb to alcoholism and other social ills. Dean tried to address this problem in part through her faith, and by helping to organize congregations. After securing land to construct Mt. Calvary Church (and establishing it), she also helped found Prosperity Chapel in Conklin, Loudoun County, Catharpin Chapel also near her home, and finally Dean-Divers Chapel (also in Prince William County, named for the Divers family of New Jersey contributors and Dean) in 1909. Meanwhile, Dean traveled around northern Virginia on weekends in a horse-drawn surrey and offered African American youth instruction in what later would be called Victorian values, as well as in skilled trades. In 1878, Dean founded what would be the first of more than a dozen Sunday schools. She continued fundraising for Sunday Schools and other improvement activities, especially during winters. She first sought employment and fundraising opportunities in Washington, D.C., and later with extended trips to New York City, and even in Boston, Massachusetts. She made the acquaintance of Oswald Garrison Villard, publisher of the New York Evening Post, who published a favorable biography of Dean, made many donations to programs she advocated, and in 1905 became chairman of the board of Manassas Industrial School for Colored Youth (although he criticized her management and ousted her as leader three years later). In Boston, Dean made the acquaintance of Edward Everett Hale, who not only donated money, but also opened social doors to Dean, including to Rev. Phillips Brooks and his Episcopalian congregation. In 1890, Dean, her sister Ella and Jennie E. Thompson (a white woman who supported educating African Americans) decided to establish an industrial school in Manassas to serve African Americans in the five surrounding counties, and secured an option on a farm near the railroad station. They planned to teach the students useful skilled trades, as well as inculcate values of hard work and thrift. It took almost three years to raise funds for the land down payment. In January 1893, Dean was invited to speak to a Women's Suffrage convention in Washington (after lobbying by her friend Orra Gray Langhorne of Lynchburg, Virginia). There she met heiress Emily Howland of Sherwood, New York, who donated the final $1000 to finish paying for the farm, as well as start building the first hall (which was named after Howland). On October 7, 1893, Manassas Industrial School for Colored Youth received its charter. It accepted students the following fall. Frederick Douglass was among the speakers at the dedication ceremony that September. Dean took the title of financial agent, and also served on the board of directors and executive committee. Students could study liberal arts, as well as receive instruction in dressmaking, child care, blacksmithing, cooking, carpentry, shoemaking, and farming. However, after about a year in 1895, Howland Hall caught fire and burned down, so had to be rebuilt. Several years later, in 1900, the boys' dormitory also burned down. Nonetheless, the school prospered, and received grants from Andrew Carnegie, among others. On February 14, 1906 Jennie Dean (and several students and faculty members) visited the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt, at the invitation of Booker T. Washington, to whom the President favorably compared Dean. In 1908, however, Dean found herself pushed out of the school's management, after a critical report by accountants whom Villard had hired. Thompson and Dean had complained about the Villard faction's sexism, neglect of local donors and interests (white and black), and grandiose plans to revamp the institution into another Tuskegee Institute or Hampton Institute. While Villard resigned as chairman of the board in March, 1913 (to be replaced by the institution's first black board chairman), he remained on the board. Meanwhile, Dean's health had deteriorated after a stroke, and she became nearly confined to her home. Death and legacy Jennie Dean died after suffering another stroke on May 3, 1913. She was buried beside Mt. Calvary Chapel that she had helped found. The Library of Virginia honored Dean in 2000 as one of its inaugural class of Virginia Women in History, and in 2013 as part of its Strong Men and Women series. The Manassas Industrial School for Colored Youth continued for decades, and produced many teachers and other leaders of the African American community. It was one of only two secondary schools for African Americans in Virginia unaffiliated with a religious denomination. The state Supreme Court eventually interpreted the 1902 state constitution's free public education requirement (through litigation sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as mandating public schools for African American children. Thus, in 1938, the Manassas Industrial School formally became the only school for higher education of African American students in five northern Virginia counties (Prince William, Fairfax, Arlington, Loudoun and Fauquier). After World War II, northern Virginia's population increased and localities built new schools for African American students. Furthermore, the NAACP vehemently disagreed with requiring segregated schools, and began litigating against segregated schools, resulting in multiple decisions against such in the 1950s, including Brown v. Board of Education and a companion case from Virginia. The Manassas Industrial School closed in 1959, after Virginia governor J. Lindsay Almond Jr. acceded to decisions of the Virginia Supreme Court and a three-judge federal panel accepting the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Brown v. Board of Education. As Massive Resistance ended, the segregated facility was no longer needed. In 1994, the Manassas Industrial School site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, although the buildings had long since been torn down. It is now a 70-acre city park, with a memorial to Dean as founder, as well as (since 1995) outlines of the historic buildings and appropriate signage, a playground, ball fields, skate park, walking trails, and picnic and restroom facilities. Miss Dean's name now graces an elementary school next to the park. Arlington, Virginia also has a 22-acre park along Four Mile Run in its formerly African-American Nauck neighborhood named after Jennie Dean.

The sponsors of the original youth castles came mainly from the Wandervogel and Pfadfinder movement, or were at least linked to the youth movement.  Terminology  The term Jugendburg originally referred to the use of castles (Burgen) by young people (Jugend). The difference between Jugendburgen in this historical sense and Jugendburgen in the sense of castles that were used as youth hostels, for example run by the German Youth Hostel Association, is disputed. For example, youth hostels had already emerged in the early 20th century in the wake of the youth movement (Jugendbewegung) as accommodation for young men, youth groups and school classes. And as early as 1912 the first German youth hostel was established by Richard Schirrmann at Altena Castle (it was rebuilt from 1906 to 1915) above the town of Altena. During the Nazi era youth castles were used by the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls, and the term was increasingly associated with Nazi ideology. From 1935 to 1943 there was also a schoolchildren's magazine with the title Deutsche Jugendburg (\\"German Youth Castle\\"), which was published by the National Socialist Teachers League.  Jugendburgen in the youth movement  Finstergr√ºn Castle belongs to the Evangelical Youth of Austria In connexion with Jugendburgen one frequently comes across the names Gustav Wyneken, Robert Oelbermann and Karl Oelbermann. In 1910, the progressive educationalist, Gustav Wyneken, was the chairman of the Bund f√ºr freie Schulgemeinden and publisher of its magazine. He also tried to found a new school or \\"Jugendburg\\" to serve his progressive educational project based on the concept of upbringing as the \\"Formation of People in the Sense of a Worldview\\" (Formung des Menschen im Sinne einer Weltanschauung). For Wyneken it was about a redefinition of the relationships between teacher and pupil. This was to be based on \\"comradeship\\" (Kameradschaft) and \\"leadership\\" (F√ºhrertum). Using his pedagogical approach, Wyneken influenced the emerging youth movement as an adult from 1912 onwards. Wyneken created the concept of \\"youth culture\\" in opposition to the perceived subservience of the Wilhelminian period as well as against school and family. In 1913, he worked on the formulation of the Meissner formula of First Free German Youth Day at the Hoher Meissner. Here, too, tensions arose, since Wyneken was a leader figure, a concept rejected by many groups at the youth day. Fascinated by Wyneken's ideas, the brothers, Robert and Karl Oelbermann, dreamt of the Jugendburg concept after the First World War. Robert Oelbermann is considered to be the founder of the \\"Nerother Wandervogel - Federation for the Establishment of the Rhenish Youth Castle\\" (Nerother Wandervogel - Bund zur Errichtung der Rheinischen Jugendburg). By \\"Rhenish Jugendburg\\", he meant Waldeck Castle in the Hunsr√ºck mountains. The Nerother Wandervogel was founded on 27 March 1921 at Drachenfels Castle at Busenberg in the Wasgau region of southwest Germany. The Jugendburgen were mostly used to create an independent place of encounter whilst also preserving valuable historical monuments and giving them a new and meaningful use. Nowadays, the aims of a Jugendburg are unchanged; it is about developing young people away from the perceived restrictions and conventions of society. As the numbers of scouts and youth leagues continued to rise, the castles became international meeting places at which camps could be held.

Gabriel de Espinosa (died August 1, 1595 in Madrigal de las Altas Torres, √Åvila), was a Spanish impostor. He was the protagonist of the incident known as the \\"baker of Madrigal\\", which consisted of the impersonation of the late King Sebastian of Portugal, for which he was executed. Background After the disappearance of king Sebastian at Alc√°cer Quibir (1578), many efforts were made to ransom imprisoned Portuguese soldiers. Several soldiers returned to Portugal, which led many Portuguese to believe Sebastian had survived the battle and would return to claim his throne. This led to Sebastianism: the belief that Sebastian could return at any moment. Sebastian did not have descendants and thus eventually the throne went to his uncle Philip II of Spain, losing Portugal its independence. People involved John of Austria, father of Mar√≠a Ana de Austria. Mar√≠a Ana de Austria. Very little is known of Espinosa's early years. Some scholars believe that he was probably born in Toledo as this town had he oldest document known about him, his title of baker, but in Madrigal is believed thar he was born there. What is known is that in 1594 he arrived at Madrigal alongside his two-year-old daughter, Clara, and his wife, Isabel Cid. People noticed that the new baker spoke several languages (at least, French and German),Gabriel de Espinosa, un supuesto rey in muy historia.es knew how to ride a horse and, in general, appeared to be more than a humble officer. Although it is not impossible that he had learned these skills working for the militia of Captain Pedro Berm√∫dez, where he served. In the same town lived Friar Miguel de los Santos, the possible thinker of the scam, who had been a confessor in the court of King Sebastian, and had supported the Prior of Crato in his intention to succeed said king. For that reason he had been exiled from Portugal and sent to Castile by Philip II. The third person involved is Mar√≠a Ana de Austria, daughter of John of Austria. She entered the convent of Agustinas de Madrigal at the age of six, sent by his uncle Philip II. It seems that she had no religious vocation whatsoever, and that she preferred adventure stories, especially if they referred to her father or her cousin Sebastian, whom, like many others at the time, she believed alive. The plot Probably Friar Miguel de los Santos noticed the physical resemblance between Espinosa and Sebastian (among other things, they were both redheads, something unusual in Portugal) and convinced Espinosa to impersonate the late king. De los Santos also introduced him to Ana de Austria. Either because she believed him to actually be her cousin or just because she wanted to escape the convent she agreed to promise in marriage with him until she could obtain permission from the Pope. Sebastian was arrested in Valladolid for talking disrespectfully of the king and the jailers found on him 4 letters (two by Miguel de los Santos and two by Ana de Austria) talking about the plot. The matter was then referred to the royal court and both Miguel and Ana were also arrested. Process, conviction and death Accused of crimes of lese majesty, both Espinosa and Miguel de los santos were repeatedly interrogated, sometimes under torture. Espinosa made contradictory declarations during the process and he was sentenced to death by hanging on August 1, 1595. He remained calm and proud during the execution. After the hanging, Gabriel was decapitated and dismembered and his remains were exposed to the town in each one of the four gates of the wall. His head was exposed at the facade of the Town hall. Miguel de los Santos was also hanged in Plaza Mayor, Madrid. He maintained that he believed Espinosa to be the king. Philip II didn't take a lot of pity on his niece either. She was locked in strict closure in the convent of Our Lady of Grace, in √Åvila. After the death of Philip II (1598) Philip III forgave her and allowed her to return to the convent of Madrigal of which she eventually became prior. In literature The theme was used in some literary works of the 19th century, such as the play Traidor, inconfeso y m√°rtir by Jos√© Zorrilla (1849) or the serial El cocinero de Su Majestad o El pastelero de Madrigal (1862) by Manuel Fern√°ndez y Gonz√°lez.

He was also a founding member of the Camera di Controllo in Canada in 1962. In 1986, he was convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to two and a half years in jail. On January 29, 2016, Zito was shot to death by his son-in-law Domenico Scopelliti in a domestic dispute. After the shooting, Scopelliti fled, but turned himself in hours later to police, and was charged with first-degree murder. Scopelliti was charged with manslaughter after being found not guilty of first and second degree murder. On September 5, 2018, Scopelliti was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison. Early life Zito was born into a ‚ÄòNdrangheta crime family in Fiumara, Calabria, on August 19, 1928, one of six sons to Domenico and Angela. His father and uncle, Giuseppe were both ‚ÄòNdrangheta members. Zito tried to immigrate to North America illegally twice, once as a stowaway on a ship headed to New York City in 1947, and two years later trying to enter Texas at Galveston through Mexico; both times he was caught and deported. A murder charge against him in Italy was dropped in 1952 before he entered Canada legally through Montreal three years later, then relocating to Toronto as its connection to the Montreal mafia-bootlegging scheme. Activities and convicted manslaughter Police long believed he earned that money through gambling, loan sharking, drugs, fraud, counterfeiting and other criminal ventures. He also had an early bootlegging conviction. Zito was first a police target in Canada in 1960 in a fraud investigation and by 1962, he was seen meeting with powerful mob figures, including Giacomo Luppino boss of the Luppino crime family and Michele Racco of the Siderno Group. He received his Canadian citizenship in 1961 and was believed to be a member of the crimini or Camera di Controllo since 1962. Police also spotted Zito meeting with convicted heroin trafficker New York mobster Paolo Gambino of the Gambino crime family, who was setting up a heroin pipeline to Toronto, at a Toronto hotel on May 4, 1970. In 1978, a police investigation of a counterfeiting operation focused on a printing company Zito owned. It led to the seizure of $1.7 million in counterfeit money in Vancouver, with the bills originating in Toronto but charges against him were never laid. By the 1980s, Zito was boss of the Toronto Siderno Group after the death of Michele Racco. Police also spotted Zito often rambling through Toronto's Little Italy in the 1980s, meeting with other mob bosses like Montreal's Frank Cotroni. Zito was also aware of listening devices and used a soft voice and hand motions to communicate. In 1986, Zito was convicted of manslaughter for the murder of photo studio owner Rosario Sciarrino on January 13, 1986 for not being able to pay back a $20,000 loan plus interest for the loan sharking. Sciarrino's body was found frozen and wrapped in garbage bags in the trunk of his car after a meeting in a Brampton meat company. An autopsy showed Sciarrino was shot in the head and chest, and suffered a dozen facial fractures from an ashtray. Zito initially vanished after the shooting, but surrendered four days later to Peel homicide detectives. He limped in from a gunshot wound to the leg, telling police that \\"I, Rocco Zito, was shot on Monday, Jan. 13th, by persons unknown.\\" Police suspected the wound was self-inflicted to instill legal doubt in the initial second-degree murder charge in Sciarrino‚Äôs death, and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In 1987, Zito was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for possessing stolen goods and proceeds of crime. Death Zito was shot to death in his North York home on January 29, 2016, by his son-in-law Domenico Scopelliti in a domestic dispute at the age of 87. Scopelliti and his family shared the home with Zito. After the shooting, Scopelliti fled, but turned himself in hours later to police, and was charged with first-degree murder. Police found at least six guns ‚Äî including a pistol and a rifle ‚Äî and ammunition, stashed in closets, linen drawers and cabinets in his home. Police also found a total of $23,390 in Canadian currency, ‚Ç¨18,570 and $251 in American currency, stashed in a briefcase, wallets, an envelope and a drawer in his home. In April 2018, Domenico Scopelliti's then-wife, and one of Zito's daughters, Laura Scopelliti, who later divorced Domenico after the incident, testified in a Toronto court about the dialogue used between the two men before the shooting, and about the origins of the $1 million in his bank account and money found inside the home. On May 18, 2018, Scopelliti stated in court that he killed Zito after he had a gun point at him, fearing for his life. However, on June 20, 2018, another one of Zito's daughters, Angela Buda testified she was standing close to her father and that he did not have a gun when he was shot. Scopelliti was charged with manslaughter after found not guilty of first and second degree murder. On September 5, 2018, Scopelliti was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison. Style and philosophy Zito officially listed his occupation as a ceramic tile salesman as a business front. He lived by the philosophy of old-school modesty, disliking the flash of the modern Mafia, with its extravagant displays of wealth to show power; he believed true respect, came from \\"honour.\\" He often dismissed younger mobsters who resided north of Toronto as \\"Hollywood\\" ‚Äì Woodbridge. Zito once stated, \\"In my day, we didn‚Äôt have the big houses, drive the big cars and the suits and all the flash... But all the guys in Woodbridge have the big houses and drive the big, black SUVs and put on airs.\\" References Canadian mobsters of Italian descent Italian mobsters Murdered Canadian mobsters Murdered 'Ndranghetisti Italian emigrants to Canada People from the Province of Reggio Calabria 1928 births 2016 deaths Italian people murdered abroad People murdered in Toronto 'Ndranghetisti Naturalized citizens of Canada Bootleggers Canadian people convicted of manslaughter Deaths by firearm in Ontario ","title":"Rocco Zito"},{"id":"52472953","text":"JSON Patch is a web standard format for describing changes in a JSON document.

Bounded by Berwick Lane and Sefton Drive to the north, Broad Street to the west, Chiswick Road to the south, and the Providence River to the east, this area was developed between 1901 and 1957 as a streetcar suburb for middle and upper middle class residents on what was once a country estate. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The Aberdeen Plat was in the second half of the 19th century part of the country estate of Orray Taft, a prominent local businessman. His son Edward gave the city the eastern strip of this estate for the formation of what is now Narragansett Boulevard and Stillman Cove Park. By that time, Broad Street to the west was served by a streetcar line, running between Pawtuxet village to the south and downtown Providence to the north. The area just north of the Taft estate was being developed into residential streetcar suburb by the later 19th century. The rest of the Aberdeen Plat was acquired in several parcels by William M. Rhodes from the estate of Edward Taft in 1901. Rhodes formed the Aberdeen Land Company in 1902, which oversaw the area's subdivision and development. The district is bounded on the north by Berwick Lane and Sefton Drive, where it abuts the Edgewood Historic District-Sally Greene Homestead Plats historic district, and is bounded on the south by the centerline of Chiswick Road. The house lots in the district are slightly larger than those of some of the plats to the north, ranging in size from 6,000 to 8,000 square feet. Most of the houses are between one and 2-1/2 stories in height and of wood frame construction, although there are a few houses where brick or stucco has been applied to the exterior. Setbacks from the street are typically moderate, and the lots are wide enough to include side yards and space for garages, which in some cases were added later. The only non-residential properties are a single commercial building on Broad Street, and the portions of Stillhouse Cove Park which fall within the district boundaries.

A reboot to the Dungeon Keeper series, players construct and manage a dungeon, recruiting minions to run it, although the gameplay has a tower defence style, featuring frequent raids of others' dungeons and the defence of the player's. Players can participate in tournaments and leagues online. The game was announced in August 2013, and the development team wanted to carry over elements from the original Dungeon Keeper games by Bullfrog Productions, especially the humour. Richard Ridings provided the voiceovers, as he did with the previous instalments. The game is noted for its monetization of gameplay by relying on in-app purchases, for which it received widespread criticism. The reliance on in-app purchases also caused outcry in the gaming public. In the UK, Electronic Arts' advertising of the game was ruled to have misled customers, which forced them to amend their adverts. Electronic Arts also faced criticism over filtration of user reviews.  Gameplay  A typical dungeon. Unlike previous instalments, the game is a tower defence game, similar to Clash of Clans. As with previous instalments, the game centres around dungeon construction and management, with players hiring and controlling minions. The dungeon heart is the life force, and its destruction ends the game. Imps are the dungeon's workforce, performing tasks such as digging tiles. Rooms have set sizes instead of being constructed by tiles, and minions are summoned manually instead of appearing at regular intervals. Which minions can be summoned depends on the dungeon's composition. Rooms include the workshop (which produces traps used to defend the dungeon) and the Dark Library. Rooms can be moved without reconstruction, and some have built-in defences against intruders. Minions include trolls and warlocks. In campaign mode, major events are triggered manually. At the start, players are given a tutorial by Horny, the Horned Reaper from the previous games. Raiding other dungeons (with the goal of the opponent's destruction) using the acquired minions is a regular occurrence, and players also frequently need to defend their dungeon from invasion. During raids, rooms can be claimed and used to deploy units. There are three main types of resource: Gold, Stone, and Gems. Resources are used to construct rooms and traps, and summon minions. Stone and Gold (stored in a treasury) are produced by Stone Quarries and Gold Mines respectively. Resources are also found in dirt tiles (dug by the Imps), of which there are three types: Soft Rock, Gem Veins, and Hard Gem Veins, taking increasing amounts of time to dig respectively. The idea of this is to keep Imps busy while the player is away, and to reward players on returning. Imps can be slapped to speed up digging, and Gems can be spent to dig tiles instantly. Gems can also be spent to produce Imps, upgrade rooms, and instantly perform other actions that take time, such as room construction, and minion summoning, and can be purchased using real money within the game. Other resources include mana (produced by the Dark Library and used to cast spells (such as Dragon Breath, which conjures a dragon)), and combat points, obtained by raiding and defending dungeons. In multiplayer, players can be a member of a guild, a group which shares minions and cooperate towards achieving goals. Guild Tournaments, in which guilds compete for the rank of Horny's Chosen, are held. Victory stars are awarded based on players' performance in raids. If enough stars are earned, the guild qualifies for the tournament. The first five qualifying guilds enter the Horny's Chosen bracket. The other qualifying guilds enter a standard tournament. Guilds are ranked according to victory stars earned. The Horny's Chosen brackets yield greater Gem rewards than the standard tournament. Rewards are distributed to guild members according to participation. Guilds that do not win enter a lottery for a Gem payout. Another feature is the League of Evil, a ladder system in which players are ranked according to trophies earned. The higher the rank, the greater the resource bonus for performing successful raids. As players promote through the ranks, achievements with Gem rewards are unlocked, and players are given all achievements and Gem rewards up to that rank if they already qualify for a higher rank. Another event is Event Raids, in which players build defences to withstand waves of invaders.  Development  Dungeon Keeper was announced in August 2013, although development began the previous year. It was scheduled for a winter release, and designed for touchscreens. According to senior producer Jeff Skalski, Mythic Entertainment had to make significant changes to Dungeon Keeper for mobile platforms, although there were aspects of the original games from Bullfrog Productions they wanted to keep, such as the humour. The intention was to give players an experience of the original Dungeon Keeper. Despite this, he stated that they were not trying to recreate the original games, or the cancelled Dungeon Keeper 3, but rather a mobile game for mobile systems. The colour palette was expanded to make the creatures easier to see on mobile phones. The role of traps was increased, and gameplay was made to focus as much on offence as defence. According to Skalski, the god-view facilitated the porting to touch-screen devices. The development team took into account feedback from fans on the internet, and their goal was to make the game free so many people could play it. Skalski emphasized that the game is built for typical mobile game patterns, which meant that it is supposed to be played for brief periods multiple times per day. He disagreed with assertions that it lacks the humour of the original, due to Richard Ridings (who, according to him, is a fan-favourite) providing the voice-overs like he did with the original Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2, which included over 500 lines of dialogue. According to Nick LaMartina, director of Audio and Media, the team wanted Ridings to emote (he considered Ridings's voices in the original games flat by comparison), so the personality of Horny emerged. Ridings described working on Dungeon Keeper as \\"a licence to be bad\\", and was impressed with the scripts. According to LaMartina, the scripts contributed to how good the game sounded. Many people, including himself, the creative director, the producer, and the community manager, contributed to the scripts. LaMartina stated that the collaborative effort is what made Horny the character he is. Electronic Arts soft launched the game for Android in Canada and Australia in October 2013. The game was released worldwide free of charge on the ITunes Store for iOS and Google Play for Android on 30 January 2014, and Electronic Arts described the game as \\"a \\"twisted\\" take\\" on Bullfrog's game. The game was highly anticipated by fans of the originals.  Reception  Dungeon Keeper received a great deal of negative reception due to monetization. In particular, critics condemned the time the Gem Veins take to dig, forcing players to either wait or purchase Gems with real money. Leif Johnson of IGN heavily criticized the heavy reliance on in-app purchases and waiting times that were not present in the original game. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer criticized the game for being a Clash of Clans clone as well its reliance on microtransactions, and commented that Dungeon Keeper had gone free-to-play in a \\"soulless\\" way. Jim Sterling of The Escapist echoed these sentiments, describing the game as \\"One of the worst examples of a cancer that is eroding the market\\", and also criticizing the \\"babyish\\" characters and the lack of dark humour and appeal of the original game. Jeuxvideo.com described the game as \\"Outrageous\\", and criticized the difficulty of playing without paying, as well as the behaviour of the units when confronting the enemy, although they commented that some of the humour of the original game is present. Scott Nichols of Digital Spy criticized the waiting times and commented that they render the invasions inadequate for game worth. Jaz Rignall of USgamer initially complimented the graphics and gameplay, but described the game as \\"a sad, knock-off of a wannabe, faux-Dungeon Keeper\\" due to the free-to-play business model. Miguel Concepcion of TabTimes heavily criticized the waiting times and how quickly the game asks for payment. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade stated that fans of the original games would be unhappy with the simplification and monetization. Peter Molyneux, creator of the original Dungeon Keeper, described the waiting times and capitalization as \\"ridiculous\\", and criticized Electronic Arts for getting the balance wrong. Reception was not universally negative. Chris Carter of Destructoid gave a mediocre review. Although he criticized the waiting times and microtransactions, he commented that raiding other dungeons can be fun. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer described the game as a \\"well polished Clash of Clans clone\\", although he criticized the waiting times. Nathan Meunier of MacLife lauded the \\"addictive\\" construction and \\"wacky\\" humour, but criticized the frequency of in-app purchases. Slide to Play described the game as \\"not too bad\\" for a freemium game employing in-app purchases. Stephen Yuen of AndroidSPIN stated that the game needs patience, but praised the graphics and sound. = Controversies = In addition to strong criticism from reviewers, the game caused outcry from the gaming public. British newspaper Independent stated that the game's use of microtransactions made it \\"unplayable\\". At one point, the outrage was dismissed as the players playing incorrectly. In February 2014, Electronic Arts was accused of censoring user ratings lower than five stars by making those players email them instead. Electronic Arts claimed the practice facilitated feedback, but was criticized for making players claim to give the highest rating in order to give one. The practice was criticized for giving an impression of popularity. Electronic Arts claimed that the outcry was mainly due to players' nostalgia for the original games, and pointed out that there were many players who did not have such criticisms. In July 2014, the British Advertising Standards Authority ruled that Electronic Arts' advertising that the game is free misled customers, ordered the addition of fine print explaining about in-app purchases, and banned the original adverts. Electronic Arts counter-claimed that in-app purchases are not mandatory and that Gems are obtainable in-game. Responding to the public criticisms, Andrew Wilson of Electronic Arts admitted that they \\"misjudged the economy\\", and resolved to learn from them. He also stated that they failed to deliver value. Peter Molyneux stated that they forgot about Dungeon Keepers spirit, and expressed regret at not offering his input on the game, despite being consulted by the developers. Electronic Arts' head of mobile, Frank Gibeau, also stated that they \\"innovated too much\\". Shamus Young of The Escapist cited Electronic Arts' lack of understanding of the market and game design, and poor public relations as reasons the game was not successful.

History The site was originally occupied by Gatcombe Manor, a medieval house which was acquired through marriage by Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, Bt in the 18th century. The War Office requisitioned the land from Curtis for military purposes in the 1770s. (Gatcombe House, which was rebuilt in 1780, was subsequently occupied by Sir Roger's son, Sir Lucius. He had vacated it by 1849;'Gatcombe House to be Let': London Gazette, Issue 21030, page 3141, 19 October 1849 it was subsequently used as part of the barracks and survives as a Grade II listed building.) A plan for barracks on the site was first drawn up by William Dundas in 1756, in connection with the construction of Hilsea Lines (designed to protect Portsmouth and its Dockyard from landward attack). Building commenced in 1780; as designed, the barracks consisted of rows of long wooden huts arranged around three sides of a parade ground. In 1794 the barracks were extended, so as to accommodate several thousand troops. Following the Napoleonic Wars these barracks were gradually dismantled, the last part being taken down (and the materials sold) in February 1822. Only the associated hospital was retained. In 1854 Hilsea Barracks were rebuilt, on a more permanent basis, for occupation by the Royal Field Artillery; accommodation was provided for 100 men and 100 artillery horses, (more was added subsequently). By 1864 two batteries of the Royal Artillery were stationed there. The men were accommodated in brick huts measuring by , 22 men to a hut. Accommodation for the officers was provided in Gatcombe House. A new pavilion plan hospital was built in 1865. A military chapel known as \\"St Barbara's Garrison Church\\" was added in 1888. The Royal Field Artillery vacated the site in 1921, whereupon it became the main headquarters and training depot for the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, with Gatcombe House serving as the Headquarters Officers' Mess. During the Second World War the site was used by the United States Army. The RAOC moved their regimental depot to Feltham Barracks in 1946 and vacated the site entirely on 31 March 1962. The buildings, which had undergone various improvements and changes of use over the years, were demolished to make way for the \\"Gatcombe Park\\" housing development in 1965. The Victorian riding school, built for the Royal Artillery in the 1890s and some of the walls which enclosed the barracks still survive.Mitchell, p. 30 References Sources * Barracks in England Installations of the British Army ","title":"Hilsea Barracks"},{"id":"52473195","text":"Ren√© √âcuyer (born 4 September 1956) is a French former swimmer.

Paw hsan hmwe is known for its good cooking quality, fragrant aroma, texture, good milling recovery, and substantial grain elongation during the cooking process. The medium-length grains of this rice variety can elongate up to three times in length while cooking. Paw hsan hmwe has intermediate amylose content, higher than jasmine rice, contributing to its hardness quality in line with Burmese consumer preferences. Myanmar's Paw San rice is one of the world's most recognized high quality rice, it was awarded the world's best rice at the Rice Trader's World Rice Conference in 2011. Paw San rice has a similar aroma, grain quality and eating quality to the reputable aromatic rice varieties of the world, namely Basmati of India and Pakistan and Jasmine of Thailand. It has a strong aroma similar to Jasmine rice and the fluffiness and elongation-up to 3 times after cooking of Basmati rice. Despite these qualities, Paw San rice has not made it to the export market due to its low yield. As well, a high domestic demand leaves little to export. The low yield has been an important barrier to its wider adoption; only about 6% of the area under rice cultivation was planted to Paw San in 2013. In order to meet export target and increase export value, Myanmar would need to promote the wider adoption of Paw San rice. To support the campaign for adoption, the county also would need to develop the infrastructure and the technology to increase productivity.  Varieties  Paw hsan hmwe is a variety of Oryza sativa. Paw hsan hmwe is the market name for two varieties of paw hsan rice, namely paw hsan gyi (), also known as Shwebo paw hsan, and paw hsan yin (). The former variety is photoperiod sensitive and retains its aroma for up to 2 years with proper harvesting and storage, while the latter is non- photoperiod sensitive and possesses a strong aroma that fades after 5‚Äì6 months. Paw hsan gyi was developed in 1944 using pure line selection of the paw hsan rice varieties.  Production and cultivation  Paw hsan hmwe is largely cultivated in the Irrawaddy delta region of Myanmar. Since the mid-2000s, cultivation has expanded to Upper Myanmar.

Around 600 people attended, with the local railway offering reduced fares for the occasion. Wood was presented with an inscribed silver trowel as a gratitude for laying the stone and his generous donations towards to development. The building was designed by architect T. Bridge in \\"early pointed style of architecture\\", and construction was overseen by his father, E. Bridge. The church was built of bricks in a cruciform layout, including a spire.

Thomas Jackson was one of the most prominent early Americo- Liberian and was among the early American settlers of Liberia. Thomas Jackson is mentioned in the African Repository by the American Colonization Society and the Maryland State Colonization Society. Emigration to Liberia Thomas Jackson a mason was emancipated in view of emigrating to Liberia by his master W. N. Ritchie, Esq. and Amelia Jackson (seamstress) his wife known simply as \\"Milly\\" was emancipated in view of emigrating to Liberia by her master J. P. Thompson, Esq. Thomas Jackson and Amelia Jackson both emigrated to Liberia aboard the ship Lafayette, which sailed from Baltimore for Monrovia, on December 7, 1832 and arrived in Monrovia on January 20, 1833. Thomas Jackson was 40 years old and Milly 37 years old at the time they sailed on the Lafayette. Both settled at Caldwell and shortly after, Milly Jackson died in 1834. Thomas Jackson later joined the emigrants on the Brig ANN which arrived in Monrovia and headed to Cape Palmas arriving February 11, 1834 where he settled. Thomas Jackson was prominent and influential in the affairs of the colony. He was appointed an assistant Agent by the Maryland State Colonization Society in 1835 and became a magistrate, 1837 - 1848. Thomas Jackson later married Anna Maria Scott a manumitted slave from Talbot County in 1837. Anna Maria Scott departed from Baltimore on June 28, 1835 on the schooner Harmony, arriving at Cape Palmas, Liberia on August 23, 1835. She married Thomas Jackson in 1837, gave birth to Victoria (Victory) in 1845 and John Payne Jackson was born on March 25, 1848. As a prominent figure in the colony in Liberia, Thomas Jackson would often travel to the United States to give speeches about the status of the African American colony in Liberia and was supportive of American Colonization Society. Thomas Jackson felt that the only way African Americans could be successful was by colonizing a new space in West Africa (This is evidenced in his letters to the Maryland State Colonization Society published in the Maryland Colonization Journal). An extract mentions one of his trips as advertised in the local press: \\"On September 20, 1838, Thomas Jackson, of Cape Palmas, addressed a crowd at the Evangelical Lutheran Church on East Church Street in Frederick on the colonization program. He left Frederick for Africa in 1831. (The independent African state of Maryland was founded at Cape Palmas in 1833 and was annexed by Liberia in 1857.)\\" Missionary work Thomas Jackson was a staunch christian who readily gave up his role as deputy Judge to dedicate his life in the spreading of the Gospel to the natives. This can be better described by the letter written by Samuel McGill (of the McGill family - The first official doctor of African descent for the ACS‚Äô colony in Liberia) to the President of the Maryland State Colonization Society dated June 26, 1843, Harper, Cape Palmas and published in the Maryland Colonization Journal. > One of our most intelligent and enterprising colonists, originally from > Maryland, has recently resigned an honorable and lucrative trust in the > colony, in order to engage in missionary operations. Rev. Thomas Jackson, > the individual in question has accepted of an appointment by the Methodist > mission, and is now located at Saurika, some distance in the interior. He > felt it his duty to go forth and aid in the spread of the Gospel, for which > the Africans suffer. He has erected his dwelling, has opened a school, and > large numbers attend his preaching. Already the poor natives have been > benefited by his ministry, and his labors have but just commenced. Who is to > publish the farther proceedings of this devoted colonial missionary !

Thomas Jackson was listed as a Reverend and probationer of the Methodist Church in the Journal of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church 1844-1847\\\\. Evidence of his missionary work was mentioned in the Journal of a tour of Governor John B Russwurm and Mr Stuart to the Saureekai, Toboe and Bolobo countries on October 4, 1843, published in the Maryland Colonization Journal: > Having determined on a visit to the interior as far as the Bourroboh > country, and everything being ready for our departure, King Freeman, Yellow > Will, J.

The foundation was established in 2000 by the composer Hagar Kadima as the Israeli Women Composers Forum. In 2014 the Forum has also expanded to include women performers, thus getting its current name. In the same year, the Forum has become a musical organization uniting composers and performers and is assisted by the Felicja Blumenthal Music Center, Tel Aviv.  The activities that led to the establishment of the Forum  The participants of the annual project of the Israeli Women Composers & performers Forum for 2015, ‚ÄúSappho‚Äôs Poetry‚Äù Several events have led to the foundation of the Israeli Women Composers Forum. Among them: the creation of a group of several active women composers, initiated by composer Hagar Kadima, a mutual production of the first women composer concert, ‚ÄúPatches‚Äù and the first professional gathering of women composers in Israel on July 7, 2000. Twenty five composers attended the important meeting, in which it was unanimously decided to establish a foundation of Israeli women composers. As the chairwoman of the foundation the composers chose Hagar Kadima- the first Israeli woman composer receiving a PhD in composition (1988, UCSB- University of California in Santa Barbara). ‚ÄúPatches‚Äù, the first concert in Israel dedicated entirely to music composed by women took place at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in August 2000. At the same month, The Israeli Women Composers Forum became a foundation in Israel.  The reasons for the organization‚Äôs establishment and for its existence today  In historical perspective, the first generation of composers in Israel included only one woman, Verdina Shlonsky (1905-1990), who received in 1931 a first prize for a woman composer from the French government for her piece ‚ÄúA Hebrew Poem for Voice & Piano‚Äù. Only forty-two years later did she receive recognition also in Israel by getting the Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers in Israel award life‚Äôs work achievement in the field of concert music. Among other women composers not living today, it is worth to mention Yardena Alotin, Mary Even-Or, Chaya Arbel and Noa Blass. Shlonsky and Alotin were the only women composers on which there was written a chapter in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1980. Since Shlonsky and until 2016, only three women composers have received the life‚Äôs work achievement Award in the field of concert music: Tsippi Fleischer, Betty Olivero and Sara Shoham. Hilat Ben Kenaz has received the Angel Price for composition in the year 2011. Statistical examination that the Forum has made in its first years have led to the conclusion that while women composers were one third of the whole composers in Israel, their part in broadcasts, commissions, recordings and performances of Israeli Classical Music was nearly 5-10%. Until 2000 there weren‚Äôt any women lecturers teaching composition. The first woman composer ever working as a composition lecturer, and later as a professor, was Betty Olivero at the Bar-Ilan University. Until 2016, Olivero is the only woman composer owning this academic status. Checking concert programs of music performance groups in Israel (orchestras and ensembles) has shown that out of dozens of Israeli pieces performed in the first sixty years of the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra, only six were composed by women. Among other performance groups, including contemporary music ensembles, the situation was similar. It was revealed through the examinations was of dozens of active women composers in the field of concert music, that both the audience and the establishment are not aware of their existence, and hundreds of pieces composed without receiving a performance. ‚ÄúThe Israeli Women Composers Forum‚Äù was therefore founded due to a strong demand to change this situation, and since it was established, its main goal is to raise the awareness for the existence and art of Israeli women composers. ‚ÄúThe Israeli Women Composers Forum‚Äù has always been a plural organization, and it welcomes music by women composers from all styles and genres. As of beginning of 2016, The Israeli Women Composers Forum initiated and produced three festivals, thirty-eight concerts, nine lectures and workshops and four radio programs, dedicated entirely to music by Israeli Classical composers and performed in Israel‚Äôs central venues by the best performers. This activity was one of the main causes for a change in the representation of Israeli women composers in Israeli culture during the first decade of the 21st century. Nowadays, there are more women composers getting public recognition, there is an improvement in the number of performances in recordings and on stage, and more and more women composers are commissioned to write for ensembles and orchestras. Israeli women composers are no longer a rare phenomenon, and they become a bigger part of the local cultural and musical scene. However, this process has not yet been completed, and the Israeli Women Composers and performers Forum continues its activity towards a full representation of women composers in the Israeli Classical Music scene.

She was a ferry pilot - picking up and delivering various military aircraft to and from factories and airbases throughout the United States. She won the Air Medal, and was the only woman awarded one in World War II.  Early life  London was born on July 1, 1920 in Seattle, Washington. In 1940 at the University of Washington in Seattle, she enrolled in the Civilian Pilot Training program, while working at Boeing on B-17s. She soon became a flying instructor, flying sea planes as well as land planes. Approximately one woman was admitted for every ten men to this program. Her mother was very supportive of her decision to fly.  World War II  At the start of World War II, London joined the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron which was later called Women's Airforce Service Pilots, a program which delivered military aircraft across the country. At 22 years old, London was the youngest of them all. She was the 14th one to join. Her first mission was in late October 1942. London and five other women were given the task to deliver Piper Cubs from Delaware to an aircraft factory in Pennsylvania in order to prove to the Army that they could fly airplanes. London along with the others succeeded in this mission. Another mission London flew was with the five other women and seventeen male pilots in delivering several PT-17s. They each took a plane from Montana to fly and deliver to an airbase in Tennessee. On the second day, London and the rest of the women had arrived at the airbase while the majority of the men had not. This proved to the Army that women were not only capable of flying, but could fly larger planes. In 1943, she became commanding officer of the Long Beach 6th Ferrying Group at Daugherty Field and the program was renamed to the Women Air-force Service Pilots. In one ten-day period in 1943, London flew a total of 8,000 miles. For these accomplishments, she was awarded the Air Medal. London was moved to an Army airbase in Long Beach, California and became a squad commander and was there along with Cornelia Fort, Evelyn Sharp, Barbara Towne, and Bernice Batten. She took many long trips from this base of picking up and delivering planes. She once left her base in California to deliver a plane in New Jersey. \\"They sent me up to Buffalo. I picked up an airplane there and delivered it to Montana. They sent me from there to Kansas City, where I picked up another plane and took it to Alabama, which put me on the East Coast, and so they sent me up to Long Island for another plane that I took back to California. I was gone a month--with one change of clothes!\\" Female pilots like London typically carried a small bag of clothes due to a lack of room in the planes they flew. In March 1944, London became only woman who had received the Air Medal after flying an 8,000 miles. These 8,000 miles consisted of four separate 2,000 mile trips flown in just five days during the summer of 1943. She first delivered a DC-3 from her base in California and flew it to base in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She then picked up a P-47 Thunderbolt at that base and delivered it to California. Then she picked up a P-51 Mustang and delivered it back to For Wayne. Finally, she picked up another P-47 Thunderbolt and took it back to her airbase. London made her final trip on December 19, 1944 from Long Beach to Sacramento, California delivering a P-61. She was then picked up by military transport and brought back to Long Beach.  Later life  London married Jack London Jr. in April 1945, who was also a pilot. Her daughter, Terry London Rinehart, became an airline pilot. After the war, London wanted to continue to fly, but she was turned down by airlines that forwarded her stewardess applications instead. Barbara London ran a flight school and charter service, and later worked at the Long Beach Airport. She also assisted in the founding of the All Woman Transcontinental Air Race and the Long Beach chapter of the Ninety Nines. In 2010, London received the Congressional Gold Medal. She died on 7 July 2013, in Los Gatos, California.  External links  * This is Us!

The station opened in 1856 and is located on the ≈Å√≥d≈∫‚ÄìForst (Lausitz) railway, Wroc≈Çaw‚ÄìPozna≈Ñ railway and Leszno‚ÄìZbƒÖszy≈Ñ railway. The train services are operated by PKP, Przewozy Regionalne, Koleje Wielkopolskie and Koleje Dolno≈õlƒÖskie. History In 1853 a decision was made to build a railway line connecting Wroc≈Çaw with Pozna≈Ñ. It obtained the concession for the construction Upper Silesian Railway (Oberschlesische Eisenbahn Gesellschaft), and construction started in Leszno, in three directions: to Wroc≈Çaw, Pozna≈Ñ and G≈Çog√≥w. A prototype steam locomotive entered Leszno station from Rawicz on 27 September 1856, and the first regular train service started on 27 October 1856. The ceremonial opening of the line, involving city authorities and residents, took place 29 October 1856. On 1 December 1857, the 45 km line Glogau was opened. After the end of World War I, the railway between Wschowa and Lasocice became a border crossing between Poland and Germany. From April to June 1919 the line from G≈Çog√≥w to Leszno transported many soldiers of General Haller travelling from France (among others, via Zagan) into Polish territory. The connection between Leszno and Ostrow Wielkopolski and Jarocin opened on 1 October 1888. Another line was the route to W≈Çoszakowice, opened on 1 October 1, 1895 and subsequently extended to Wolsztyn and ZbƒÖszynek in 1896. Construction was completed in 1904. On 15 September 1916 the 60-kilometer line from Leszno to Krzel√≥w railway opened. It followed the Wroc≈Çaw - Pozna≈Ñ railway in a southerly direction from the now closed Leszno Dworzec Ma≈Çy railway station and Leszno Zaborowo railway station. After blowing up the bridge at Kopanica during the Greater Poland Uprising the railway line became impassable. On 17 January 1920 Leszno - Laskowa was taken out of use and in 1922 dismantled. In the interwar period, Leszno station served as a border control station. On the railway line between Leszno and G≈Çog√≥w there were 2 pairs of international passenger trains (without stopping in Lasocicach, border control station in Leszno), and 3 pairs of trains to the border at Lasocice doje≈ºd≈ºa≈Çy from Leszno. The same thing happened on the railway line No. 271. Here the border was on the line of today's border of Greater Poland Voivodeship and Lower Silesia Voivodeship. The train service was limited to 2 passenger trains and express train 801/802 between Wroclaw and Gda≈Ñsk. From Poznan, two passenger trains reached Rawicz. Just as the railway line No. 14, the station Leszno was a border control station. Electrification of the lines around Leszno took place in three stages: *31 May 1969: - Pozna≈Ñ - Puszczykowko *20 December 1969: Puszczykowko - Leszno *22 April 1970: Leszno - Wroc≈Çaw Prior to the construction of Pozna≈Ñ Franowo freight yard, Leszno served as a marshalling yard for Pozna≈Ñ.

At about 4:40 p.m., a major wind and hailstorm started in the town. The storm later spawned a tornado, which touched down at the west edge of the town limits, demolishing a farmyard and cement plant. Occurrence The tornado hit Pilot Butte at approximately 4:40 p.m. on August 26, 1995. A ball tournament was being held at the same time as the storm hit. The hailstorm came in first, which produced golf ball sized hail. Later, a tornado formed on the west edge of the town limits. The south and west ends of the town were effected heavily, however, every property in the town had some damage done to it. Over 500 homes in the community were left without power, resulting in Sask Power crews having to come to restore power. =State of emergency= At 5:45 p.m., a state of local emergency was declared for Pilot Butte and its surrounding area. On site emergency responders came from Pilot Butte and Regina, some of which included the Regina Emergency Communications Team, the Saskatchewan Emergency Measures Organization and the local R.C.M.P. Portable water, shelter, food and emergency building materials were provided by the Red Cross and by Provincial Social Services for those who needed it. The rink became a temporary hospital. Aftermath Tattered siding and shingles on houses, broken windows in buildings, and dented cars were all common in Pilot Butte. The Betteridge farmstead, next to the town, was reduced to a pile of rubble. Yet the most heartfelt loss in some ways involved the more than 2400 trees that were marred and subjected to removal. Flooding became a major result of the storm, parts of the town and Regina were flooded with 25 cm of rain within 1 hour of the storm. Golfball and larger hail left drifts 50 cm deep in several places around the town. The worst damage from the storm was in the west and south ends of the town, where a farmyard and cement plant were demolished, along with many homes and all of the trailer park, the 72-unit trailer park was in total ruin. Almost all trees in the town were damaged and uprooted, resulting in very messy streets full of broken trees and branches. After one month, the town was back to normal and rebuilding started up, about a decade later, the cement plant was fully rebuilt. Hockey team In 2001, Pilot Butte's junior hockey team was renamed from the Express to the Storm to remember the Pilot Butte Storm of 1995. Since then, the Storm won the division title in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The Storm won the Athol Murray Trophy in 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2012 to earn the right to represent Saskatchewan at the Keystone Cup. In 2011 the Storm had their best result in team history finishing as Keystone Cup Bronze medalist.

History The Language Bureau was established in the early 1970s by the Government of the Northwest Territories. At its inception, the Language Bureau employed three permanent Inuit translator/interpreters and four temporary Dene translator/interpreters for nine elected members of Parliament. Along with providing translation and interpretation services, the bureau was responsible for language literacy programs, training and certification of translators and interpreters, terminology research, and language development. The election of unilingual Aboriginal MLAs and changes to legislation and language policy, requiring services to be available in Aboriginal languages and extending the right to sit on a jury to unilingual Aboriginal people, increased demand for the bureau‚Äôs services. In 1993, their staff had grown to 21, including 13 Inuit translator/interpreters and 8 Dene translator/interpreters. The Language Bureau was active for nearly 25 years. It was closed in the late 1990s.  Responsibilities  = Language Services = The bureau offered translation of government documents into Aboriginal languages, simultaneous interpreting in Parliament, and interpreting at community meetings, in a number of ministries and in courts.

It contributed to the preservation of oral Aboriginal languages, for example, continuing the development of a Dene writing system in Romanized orthography. It also offered Dene language literacy courses jointly with the Department of Education, targeted to people becoming teachers or interpreters. = Training = Before any translation and interpretation programs were available elsewhere in the Northwest Territories, training was provided by the Language Bureau. In 1987 and with government funding, Arctic College began offering year-long certificates in translating/interpreting at two of its campuses. The bureau and the college both offered certificates until the program was cut in 1996, and until the Language Bureau was closed in the late 1990s.

The debut feature of a director known only as Metal Man, the comedic faux-documentary was shot on location in Manchester on a budget of ¬£400.Britflicks.com Plot When a battered video camera sold to a Manchester pawnshop, a remarkable tape is found inside. The film details the mundane lives of two friends, Barry Tubbulb and Julian \\"Windows\\" Andrews, as they attempt to live in the \\"real world\\" after their all-consuming passion - the on-line video game, Wizard's Way ‚Äì is closed down. The plight of the two gamers and the insular world of multiplayer online gaming, is documented by two young film-makers, Joe (Joe Stretch) and Chris (Chris Killen), who hope to make an award-winning film about the gamers' social failure and the demise of Wizard's Way, an antiquated online multiplayer game with a rapidly dwindling fanbase. Even with Barry's guidance, the workings of the early-generation game remain somewhat obscure, involving Medieval wizards, dragons and various rural townsfolk competing for points in an extremely rudimentary game, characterized by poorly pixilated imagery, limited color options and painfully slow game action. The film-makers are especially keen to find the game's undisputed master, known as \\"Windows,\\" who happens to live in the same town. But before they can interview Windows, aka Julian, at home, they have to get past his overprotective flatmate Barry (Socrates Adams-Florou), a bearded layabout who lives and sleeps in the flat's bathroom. Barry warns them against disturbing Windows when he's \\"in-game\\", and hogs the camera to describe Wizard's Way and his friendship with Windows, whom he describes as being \\"the Michael Jackson of Wizard's Way - but alive.\\" When Windows (Kristian Scott) turns up, it's clear that he's a shy, ordinary guy who just likes to play video games for hours at a stretch. He doesn't seem keen on being interviewed, but puts up with the film makers - until their visits become too intrusive. As he begins to lose his grip on the project, Joe come up with a few strategies to draw Windows from his shell, but he fails to anticipate the consequences his disruptive film making may have on the game's loyal fans.

Archdeacon John Rudying In the centre of the floor of the chancel in St Andrew's church are the remains of a \\"very remarkable\\" monumental brass to Archdeacon John Rudying (died 1481) who is said to have rebuilt or refurbished the chancel of the church at his own expense in about 1470.St Andrew's Church on the Biggleswade History Society Timeline In 1471 he donated a Bible in Latin manuscript, said to be of c.1320 or earlier, to the Parish Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Buckingham which was later taken away and subsequently restored to the parish.An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in Buckinghamshire, Volume 2, North. Originally published by His Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1913 pp. 71‚Äì77 Rudying held a large number of ecclesiastical offices, many of them simultaneously, including Prebendary of Biggleswade in Lincoln Cathedral, Archdeacon of Bedford, Vicar of St Michael the Archangel in Gloucester, Archdeacon of Stow, Archdeacon of Northampton and Archdeacon of Lincoln.Philip Rutt, Biggleswade Parish Church: The Building and Its History (2011) p12 Despite all these pluralist offices Rudying clearly chose to be buried in St Andrew's in Biggleswade by setting down so large a tomb. Perhaps it was his intention to be buried in the centre of the chancel he had rebuilt or at the least had restored; however, he is actually buried in Buckingham.

Scholarly history This is the same memorial that was said to have been destroyed during the restoration of St Andrew's Church in 1870. The archaeologist Herbert Haines (1861) described the brass as lying in a large Purbeck Marble slab in the middle of the chancel, measuring , with the effigy of Archdeacon Rudying and the canopy with Saints John the Baptist, Anna, Elizabeth, and Mary of Egypt being destroyed. The figures of Death and angels and a Latin inscription in sixteen verses and a largely damaged marginal inscription in ten Latin verses survived.

The stadium is the home of the Georgia State University Panthers football team as of the 2017 season, replacing the Georgia Dome which had served as their home stadium from the program's inception in 2010 until 2016. It was also the home of the Atlanta Legends of the Alliance of American Football (AAF). Center Parc Stadium was originally built for the 1996 Summer Olympics as Centennial Olympic Stadium. Following the 1996 Summer Paralympics, the Olympic Stadium was reconfigured as designed into the baseball-specific Turner Field, serving as the home of the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball from 1997 until 2016. After the Braves' departure for Truist Park in Cobb County, Georgia State University acquired Turner Field and its surrounding parking lots for a large scale expansion of the Georgia State campus, which includes new private and student housing, academic, and retail space, in addition to the stadium redevelopment. History =1996 Summer Olympics= The stadium was originally constructed as the 85,000-seat Centennial Olympic Stadium and used for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Private entities, including NBC and other Olympic sponsors, agreed to pay a large sum of the cost to build Centennial Olympic Stadium (approximately $170 million of the $209 million bill). It was complete and ready for the Opening Ceremony in July 1996, where it hosted track and field events and the closing ceremony. =Turner Field= Immediately after the 1996 Summer Paralympics, which followed the Olympics, the stadium went through its first conversion. Much of the north end of the stadium was removed in order to convert it to its permanent use as a 49,000-seat baseball park. The stadium hosted the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball from to , following a multimillion-dollar renovation to retrofit the stadium for baseball by removing the temporary stands that had made up nearly half the stadium and building the outfield stands and other attractions behind them. The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) sought to build the stadium in a way that it could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for the conversion. This was considered a good agreement for both the Olympic Committee and the Braves. The 71,000-seat Georgia Dome had been completed four years earlier by the state of Georgia to become the home of the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons, so there was no need for another large stadium in downtown Atlanta. Furthermore, the Braves had already been exploring opportunities for a new stadium. The Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority owned the stadium and leased it to the Braves, who operated the stadium. As Turner Field, the stadium hosted notable events such as games 1 and 2 of the 1999 World Series and the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The end of the Braves' most recent lease in 2016 coincided with the team's departure for Truist Park. =Conversion to Center Parc Stadium= In November 2013, the Atlanta Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field upon the expiration of their lease in 2016 after negotiations between the team and the city of Atlanta to extend the lease broke down. According to then-Braves vice chairman John Schuerholz, Turner Field required $350 million in renovations‚Äî$150 million for structural upkeep and $200 million to improve the fan experience. Then-Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed stated that the city could not afford the cost of the renovations desired by the Braves while also partially funding the construction of Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the Falcons and the renovation of Philips Arena (now known as State Farm Arena) for the National Basketball Association's Atlanta Hawks. Between April and May 2014, Georgia State University announced its intentions to pursue the Turner Field site for a mixed use development. One proposed development plan included reconfiguring Turner Field into a football stadium and building a new baseball field on the footprint of the former Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium, incorporating the wall where Hank Aaron hit his historic 715th home run; an alternate proposal submitted in November 2015 proposed adaptively reusing portions of the ballpark for a mixed housing and retail development while a new football- specific stadium was built to the north along with the aforementioned new baseball field. On December 21, 2015, the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority announced that they had accepted Georgia State's bid for the stadium property. It was decided to go with the reconfiguration plan and on August 18, 2016, Georgia State and the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority reached a tentative purchase agreement for Turner Field, and the purchase and redevelopment plan was approved by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia on November 9, 2016. The sale of the Turner Field property to Georgia State was officially closed on January 5, 2017, with the stadium conversion project beginning in February 2017. The stadium acquisition and renovation project was expected to cost $52.8 million; the university did not expect to add or increase student fees to fund the project, and the proceeds would come from revenue from bookstore operations, parking, and housing, as well as private donations. Renovations took place over multiple phases, and included installing an artificial turf playing surface, reorienting the lower bowl, covering upper deck seating, and upgrading locker rooms. Initial capacity for the stadium was 23,000, with future expansion for 33,000. In addition to football, the university intends to use the stadium as a multipurpose facility. The university announced on February 9, 2017 that the Panthers' first game in Georgia State Stadium was scheduled for August 31, 2017 against Tennessee State. Reconstruction for Georgia State Stadium began on February 27, 2017, and the first phase of construction was completed prior to the Panthers' first scheduled game at the stadium. The second phase of construction took place in 2018 and built out the remainder of the stadium. While the university planned to tailor the stadium to suit the Panthers' football team and its future needs, the university also planned to honor the legacy of the 1996 Olympics and the Braves' tenure at the stadium. On August 8, 2017, the university announced that the playing surface would be named in honor of Georgia State alumnus Parker H. \\"Pete\\" Petit, who contributed $10 million towards the Panthers athletic program. On September 21, 2017, WSB-TV reported that an August inspection by a fire protection company found several deficiencies with the stadium's fire sprinkler system. University officials were aware of several issues in need of repair when they acquired the stadium, but they did not realize the full scope of the fire protection system's defects until the report was released. Despite the report, the state's Fire Marshal's office issued a conditional occupancy certificate for the stadium with the university using a state-approved Fire Watch system. Prior to and since the acceptance of the bid from Georgia State and developers Carter and Oakwood Development for Turner Field, residents of the Summerhill and Mechanicsville neighborhoods, which lie adjacent to the stadium, have expressed their criticisms over the impending development, particularly over the potential of being displaced due to gentrification, despite both Georgia State and the developers seeking input from local residents to help mitigate their concerns. In April 2017, protesters set up a tent city near the stadium; however, the encampment was removed by the Georgia State Police Department at the behest of Summerhill residents in June 2017 for health and safety reasons. On August 11, 2020, the university entered a naming rights agreement for Georgia State Stadium with the Atlanta Postal Credit Union. The stadium was renamed Center Parc Credit Union Stadium, or Center Parc Stadium for short, in a contract lasting 15 years and valued at $21 million. =Stadium firsts= The stadium's first event was the 2017 Corky Kell Classic, a series of high school football games, on August 18 and 19, 2017. The first Panthers home game in the stadium was on August 31, 2017, a 17‚Äì10 loss to the Tennessee State Tigers in front of an announced sellout crowd of 24,333. Georgia State's first home victory at Georgia State Stadium came on October 26, 2017 with a 21‚Äì13 victory over the South Alabama Jaguars. Foo Fighters played the first concert at Georgia State Stadium on April 28, 2018 as part of the Concrete and Gold Tour. The Legends' first home game was played on February 24, 2019 against the Birmingham Iron, where they lost 28-12. =Other events= In 2018, Georgia State Stadium became the new neutral home of the MEAC/SWAC Challenge.https://www.theatlantavoice.com/articles/meac-vs-swac-challenge- moves-to-atlanta/ On May 7, 2019, the Georgia High School Association (GHSA) announced that the football championships would be moved from Mercedes-Benz Stadium to Georgia State Stadium starting in the 2019 season, citing the higher costs of renting Mercedes-Benz Stadium compared to the former Georgia Dome. The GHSA's two years at Mercedes-Benz Stadium were also marred by logistical issues, with the six of the eight 2017 championship games postponed and moved to school sites due to a winter storm hitting Atlanta on the weekend of the championships, and the 2018 championships were moved to mid-week due to Major League Soccer's Atlanta United FC hosting MLS Cup 2018 on December 8. Access and transportation Center Parc Stadium is located in the Southeastern Atlanta neighborhood of Summerhill. It is located on Hank Aaron Drive, which provides multiple parking areas. Center Parc Stadium is also accessible from multiple bus routes near the stadium courtesy of MARTA. MARTA does not offer a direct rail station at the stadium; however, it can be accessed from the Georgia State station on the Blue/Green Line.

It aired in the United States on Fox on December 4, 2016. This episode marked Kevin Michael Richardson's first regular supporting cast appearance, having previously served as a recurring guest star. Plot While searching for a parking spot, Homer realizes that Mr. Burns is away on a hunting trip and decides to help himself to Burns' lifestyle. While playing a round of golf in Burns' office, he accidentally trips the trapdoor controls and falls into a cement mixer. He is placed in traction for several months as a result of his injuries. The blue-haired lawyer advises Mr. Burns that while the original trapdoor was legal, his decision to renovate it means that he is now legally liable for Homer's injuries. Burns dispatches Smithers to get Homer to sign a documents waiving away a compensation claim. Marge tries to spend time with Homer, but her ideas of fun--quilting and jigsaw puzzles--bore him. After several failed attempts at getting Homer's signature, Smithers admits that he thinks Homer has a case for compensation, and Homer calls a lawyer. Marge unexpectedly bonds with Smithers, discovering that he can provide the emotional intimacy that Homer cannot; for his part, Homer enjoys this arrangement because with her emotional needs met, Marge is more willing to be physically intimate with him. Frustrated by his lack of progress and the upcoming civil suit, Burns issues an ultimatum to Smithers: get Homer to sign the waiver or be transferred to the company's nuclear plant in Chernobyl. Smithers reluctantly admits his predicament to Marge, choosing his job over their friendship. Homer overhears this, and realizing that Smithers makes Marge happy, approaches Burns and offers to sign a waiver on the condition that Smithers is allowed to keep his job. Burns agrees, and Homer feigns a fall on the steps of the courthouse so that his lawyer can file another suit. However, he accidentally drags Marge with him, and the two are hit by a truck. Both are put in traction, where they are cared for by an incompetent Grampa. Marge confesses her love for Homer because of his willingness to sacrifice a compensation claim worth millions of dollars for the sake of her happiness. Meanwhile, a fight breaks out over seating arrangements on the Springfield Elementary bus. Lisa proposes a seating plan to Principal Skinner, who promotes her to bus monitor. While Lisa's enforced seating plan initially proves successful, the children begin to resent her. Lisa goes mad with power, planning enforced seating plans for the school cafeteria and kickball teams, and ignoring Bart's warnings about discontent on the bus. The children rebel, instigating chaos on the bus and embarrassing Lisa. Milhouse wisely sets her straight, why the bus, lunch time and even recess were meant to be crazy so everyone can be themselves. Realizing how right he and Bart are and taking responsibility for her own downfall, Lisa resolves never to be a know-it-all again, but only lasts a day before correcting Ms. Hoover's many, many errors in class. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave \\"The Last Traction Hero\\" a B+ stating, \\"A great contemporary Simpsons writer wants to show us how great The Simpsons still is, and how much he or she still loves it. 'The Last Traction Hero' is credited to longtime Simpsons writer and producer Bill Odenkirk, and it‚Äôs a really good episode of The Simpsons. Like his fine, low-key 'Super Franchise Me' from a few years ago, Odenkirk builds a story around the emotional heart of the characters, finds funny angles on old jokes, and populates his script with delightfully weird touches that make 'The Last Traction Hero' plain funny from start to finish.

It is considered to be one of the oldest Tenyimi village with most Chakhesang villages and also many other Angami villages pointing their origin towards Viswema. Etymology Traditionally referred to as Viswe‚Äìra, a name given by its historical ancestor Keyho which loosely translates to as ‚ÄòA place of people with Virtue and Integrity‚Äô Viswema is also known as Ve-sr-w√º‚Äìra by the Chokri Chakhesangs and Sh√ºna‚Äìmai by the Ememei Maos. History In the past Viswema was known for making fine pottery ware. For any function and rituals earthen pots were purchased from Viswema by neighboring communities.Nepuni, William.: Socio-cultural History of Sh√ºpfomei Naga Tribe, 2010. Mittal Publications. New Delhi. =Modern era= World War II When the Japanese and INA soldiers entered Naga Hills in early April 1944, many of them stayed at the outskirt of the village. They dug trenches and built strong bunkers everywhere in the vicinity of the village. Since the Allies operation against Japanese occupation of Kohima, Viswema was continuously hit by explosive missiles which were fired by cannons from Kohima and later on from Kigwema as launching pads. Many people were killed and injured. On 10 June 1944, a message from the Allies sources was conveyed to the village elders telling them to evacuate their village. The village was evacuated the next day. Bombings on 14 June continued till the village which had more than 600 houses at that time was completely razed to the ground. The same evening the Japanese forces at Viswema retreated to the route by which they had entered Naga Hills two months back. Viswema was then taken over by the Allies.Vizol Khamo, Akhale.: Towards a Better World, 2016. Heritage Publishing House. Dimapur. 2010 Mao Gate Incident On 5 May 2010, Thuingaleng Muivah the present General Secretary of the NSCN-IM arrived at Viswema on his way to his home village of Somdal in Ukhrul district, Manipur which was strongly opposed by the Manipur government. Muivah stayed overnight at Viswema which was nearby on the inter- state border. The next day thousands gathered at Mao Gate to protest against the Manipur State Government's decision to prevent the entry of Muivah into Manipur but however violence broke out between the civilians and security forces stationed at the Manipur-Nagaland border. On that fateful day, two students were killed in indiscriminate firing by security forces of Manipur. Scores were injured. Geography Viswema is situated at above sea level on the eastern part of the Barail mountain range.

J. 1996. Early on, the identity of the pathogen was highly contested due to the inability of isolating it; thus Koch‚Äôs postulates could not be fulfilled. Scientists have previously believed that Papaya Bunchy Top Disease was caused by a virus, a mycoplasma-like organism (MLO), or a phytoplasma, but these possible pathogens have since been disproven. Since the identity of the pathogen was unknown, all diagnoses were given solely based on a list of commonly associated symptoms. Through sequencing and microscopy, scientists identified the pathogen to be a part of the genus Rickettsia in 1996. The bacterium is described as being rod-shaped, small, gram-negative, and laticifer-inhibiting. Rickettsia causes diseases in animals, such as typhus and spotted fever,Rathore, Mobeen H. 2016. as well as in other plants, such as phony disease of peach and almond leaf scorch.Hopins, Donald L. 1977. Papaya Bunchy Top is found throughout the American tropics and has been economically important due to its major impact on fruit production.Agrios, George N. 1969. There is little information about the current economic impact. Hosts and symptoms Papaya is the only known host of the disease.Davis, M. J. 1993. Symptoms typically appear around 30 to 45 days after infection. Early symptoms are chlorosis and stunting of young leaves, accompanied by internode and petiole elongation. As the disease progresses petioles and leaves become rigid and thickened. Chlorosis spreads to older leaves followed by necrosis and water-soaked spots appear on the petioles and stems. In diseased plants, flowers and fruit are rarely produced and during advanced stages of the disease, the papaya plant becomes denuded except for a few stunted leaves that remain at the apex. If fruit do set during infection, they are bitter tasting and unmarketable. Dieback can occur in some varieties of papaya when infected. A lack of latex flow from the leaves, stems, petioles, and fruit.Ploetz, R. C. 1994. was historically a very important symptom of diagnosis but has since found to be unreliable; making it important to look at many different symptoms before making a final diagnosis.Webb, R. R. 1987 Development rate and severity of symptoms are highly variable due to host, genotype, and region. Environment Papaya Bunchy Top Disease is found only in tropical areas within the Americas. It is vectored by two species of leafhopper, Empoasca papayae Oman (Sein) and Empoasca stevensi Young. The species that vector the disease is dependent on the geographical location. E. papayae is most commonly associated with vectoring the disease because of its wide distribution throughout the American tropics. E. stevensi has a smaller distribution and is mostly attributed to cases in Trinidad. Management Tolerant papaya cultivars to Bunchy Top Disease have been found and bred to help stop the spread of disease. This is the most practical method of disease management but production of these cultivars is limited to areas with a low disease pressure. Use of clean propagation material and quick removal of diseased trees are also important to prevent spread. Use of Insecticides has also been proven affective to limit leafhopper vectors. The application of antibiotics, such as chlortetracycline or tetracycline hydrochloride, into the soil around infected plants has shown some success in treating Papaya Bunchy Top Disease but has yet to become commercially available. Importance Infected papaya plants rarely flower or set fruit. Fruit production can therefore be significantly decreased. This can cause major agriculture losses within the American tropics, leading to economic impacts. Also if plants do produce fruit, it tends to be bitter and thus unmarketable. However, there is little current information on how this disease economically impacts the American tropics. Pathogenesis Rickettsia is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, laticifer-inhibiting bacterium. It is typically 0.8 to 1.6 ¬µm long and 0.25 to 0.35 ¬µm wide. The bacteria are found within the sap of the plant. The bacteria infect the plant's cells, destroying the cytoplasm along with its organelles, causing the cells to eventually collapse.

Early life and career Luigi Sansonetti was born in Rome in 1888, and entered the Livorno Naval Academy in 1905; he graduated as an ensign in 1908.Dizionario Biografico Uomini della Marina Militare. Between 1911 and 1912 Sansonetti, a young sub-lieutenant, fought in the Italo-Turkish war; he led a company of sailors in the landing at Tripoli, earning a Bronze Medal of Military Valor. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1914; during World War I, he was initially assigned to the Command of the Battle Squadron, and was later given command of torpedo boats operating in the Adriatic Sea. During the 1920s and early 1930s, Sansonetti commanded destroyers and then destroyer squadrons and flotillas; he was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1922, commander in 1926 and captain in 1932. In the same year he was assigned to the press office of the Head of Government, and in 1934 he became Chief of Staff of the Taranto Naval Department. In 1935 he was given command of the heavy cruiser Fiume, on board which he was involved in the early stages of the Spanish Civil War. In late 1936, Sansonetti was assigned to the office of the Chief of Staff of the Navy, where he remained till 1939. In 1938, he was promoted to rear admiral, and in the following year he became vice admiral. In August 1940 he was given command of the 7th Cruiser Division, with flag on the light cruiser Eugenio di Savoia. In the 1930s Sansonetti also wrote several essays on naval policy, and he was among the supporters of the building of new battleships (the Littorio class). World War II and later years When Italy entered World War II, on 10 June 1940, Sansonetti was still in command of the 7th Cruiser Division. In this role, he participated in the Battle of Calabria on July 9, 1940. In August 1940 he was appointed commander of the 3rd Cruiser Division, with flag on the heavy cruiser Trieste. In this role, Sansonetti took part in the Battle of Cape Spartivento, the Battle of Taranto and the Battle of Cape Matapan, as well as in some escort missions to Libya and in the contrast against Operation White, Operation Excess and Operation Grog. In this period, he was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valor, the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy, a German Cross in Gold and a Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. His son Vito was a lieutenant on board the destroyer Vittorio Alfieri, sunk in the battle of Cape Matapan; he was among the few survivors and was rescued and taken prisoner by a Greek destroyer, being liberated after the fall of Greece. Sansonetti left the command of the 3rd Cruiser Division in April 1941, and in July he became Deputy Chief of Staff of the Italian Navy. He played a major role in the planning of the Regia Marina's strategy in the following two years, especially in the convoy war for the supply of Axis forces in North African Campaign. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, on September 8, 1943, and Germany launched Operation Achse in order to occupy Italy and neutralized the Italian armed forces, Sansonetti remained and the naval headquarters in Rome (Supermarina) and assumed provisional command over the naval forces, while the Chief of Staff, Admiral Raffaele de Courten, followed Victor Emmanuel III in his escape towards Brindisi. In the next days, Sansonetti directed naval operations and issued orders about the armistice to ships and submarines at sea and shore commands; on 13 September 1943, after Rome surrendered to the Germans after a brief resistance, he gathered his officers and informed them that Supermarina had to cease all activities, on the Germans' orders. On September 25, Sansonetti left Rome and headed south on foot; he crossed the frontline and reached Brindisi, where the king and the government had taken refuge, after a dangerous and eventful journey. In Brindisi, he resumed his duties as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy. In April 1944 Sansonetti became president of the High Council of the Navy, an office he held till February 1951. He died in Rome on November 7, 1959, after falling from his horse. His son Ugo Sansonetti was a writer and athlete.

Ovchinnikov Borovsk - city of artists PSYCHOLOGIES: Vladimir Ovchinnikov: an artist who erected a monument Biography Vladimir Ovchinnikov was born in 1938 in Dushanbe. Graduated from Moscow State University of Civil Engineering, he worked on construction sites and was also engaged in scientific work. Candidate of Economic Sciences. Until 1998 he lived in Moscow, and then, after retirement, settled in the city of Borovsk, Kaluga Oblast. He started drawing during his school days, when there was enough free time for it. But only in the last period, after having settled in Borovsk, he was able to devote himself entirely to painting. In 2000 he had a solo exhibition at the Art Gallery of Borovsk. There he presented about 100 works - landscapes, portraits, still lifes, made with pastels.BBC August 25, 2016: Artist of Borovsk sure that the portraits of the repressed defiled not just In the reading room of the Central Library of Obninsk he met Elvira Chastikova (2003), who later would become his wife: The search in non- traditional areas led Vladimir Ovchinnikov to graffiti and wall painting: Murals by Vladimir Ovchinnikov During four summer seasons (2002-2005), Ovchinnikov, a self-taught artist, made about a hundred paintingsThe artist calls them frescoes on the houses of Borovsk, creating on the dull blank walls of city buildings, boarded-up windows, fences, about 90 different subjects (his famous countrymen, churches, historical events, genre scenes: a girl walking on the pipe of a pipeline, an old woman with a bucket near a downspout, a naked boy knocking at the locked door, a man with a giant cucumber in the hands, an old man in his window reading ¬´Times¬ª, etc.).

Gallery was destroyed by vandals in three days after the opening of the memorial. The event caused a wide resonance in the media. Vladimir Ovchinnikov is not only famous for his frescoes, which for many years adorn the walls of houses in Borovsk. His main desire - to install a monument in the city of the repressed: For fifteen years the artist collected materials for the gallery of the repressed people. In August, this monument finally appeared: 18 portraits of the repressed, which the artist has painted... on the fence of his neighbor. But his another attempt to create a memorial gallery was smashed by the actions of hooligans and vandals. On the wall of one of the shops in the center of Borovsk, a painting of 20 killed people and the image of Alexander Solzhenitsyn was destroyed after only two days. Ovchinnikov's work was destroyed methodically and carefully. References  Literature  * Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Vitaly Chernikov.

The site that has been described as \\"Instagram for drones\\", allows hobbyists to share their geo-referenced aerial photos and videos. The site launched in July 2013 by Eric Dupin and is owned by his company Dronescape. The project is based in Lyon, France. There is also an dronestagram iOS app.  Contests  It also holds an annual International Drone Photography Contest. In 2016 the competition co-sponsored by National Geographic included 5,900 submissions from 28 countries which were broken down into the three categories: Nature- Wildlife, Sports-Adventure, and Travel. To coincide with the 2015 UN climate summit in Paris, Dronestagram launched the 'Small drones, big changes' competition to find the best aerial photographs that illustrate \\"the effects of pollution on planet Earth and the solutions to tackle the problem\\". Dronestagram is partner of the Professional Drone Film Festival Contest dedicated to drone cinematographic art in Nantes.  Background  According to Eric Dupin drone photography quite literally offers a whole new perspective - he says \\"it depicts a new vision of the world, with stunning images taken from low altitude, near field\\" and distinguishes these from \\"images taken by satellite or plane or helicopter, or, on the other end, street view images\\" and notes that \\"it represents an 'intermediary layer'\\". He calls it \\"a new photographic language\\" and asserts that \\"part of the appeal is that drones can capture images of places that are impossible to reach with another flying device\\" and that while \\"with satellite images, and apps like Google Earth, we are now used to seeing Earth from above\\", \\"drone photos bring a new way of seeing the world, at low altitude, near landscapes and buildings, like a bird would do\\".  The site  The site also features a drone business directory and a drone pictures world map. As of 2015 the site has over 30,000 users. A study showed that new pictures are continuously uploaded and that the user community is steadily growing. Contribution analysis revealed participation inequality among data contributors: it was found that 55% of participating users contribute only one or two images, and that only 11% of users contribute 10 or more pictures. Analysis showed also that 92% of users contributed pictures in only one country. It also revealed a clear relationship between the income category of a country and the number of uploaded drone images among other factors. Furthermore, it identified the largest cluster of images around the project's home country France and the US' largest cluster in the southwest, which is known to be one of the thriving regions with in respect to IT development.

He became a Danish field-marshal, commander-in-chief of the Danish army, member of the Board of State, and of the Danish Privy Council, and made a Danish count. Early career As a young man, Schack began his military career by serving in the Danish army during the early years of the Thirty Years' War. He entered Swedish service in 1630, and thence in French in 1635, becoming colonel of cavalry 1642, and later mar√©chal de camp. In 1651 Schack retired from the French service to his estates in Saxe-Lauenburg, where he remained until 1656, when he became military commandant of Hamburg.Sch√∏ller, C.E.A (1901). \\"Schack, Hans\\".

Danish service Faced with imminent war with Sweden, the Danish government wanted to recruit the experienced and reputed Schack for a senior position in the Danish army. In order to satisfy Schack's demand for a permanent position, he was in 1658 appointed lieutenant-general, colonel of horse and foot, and made a member of the War Council. He also became naturalized as a Danish noblemen, receiving two manors free of charge for life; Riberhus and M√∏gelt√∏nder (the later Schackenborg Castle). As military governor, Schack commanded Copenhagen during the Swedish siege of 1659. For his successful defence of the city, he was rewarded with promotion to field-marshal. In the fall of the same year, Schack led the Danish forces to victory over the Swedes at the battle of Nyborg. Political role Schack was a popular figure in Copenhagen, not only as a defender of the city against the Swedes, but as a defender of its privileges. In 1660 he was co-opted to the Danish Rigsr√•d, in spite of being a recently naturalized foreigner. When Frederick III in the same year overthrow the Danish constitution, and created an absolute monarchy, Schack was, together with Hannibal Sehested, the King's main supporter in the Rigsr√•d, persuading the clergy and bourgeoisie to support the regime change. The King needed loyal supporters in the government, and Schack was in 1660 appointed to Rigsfeltherre (commander-in-chief of the Danish army), and made president of the Board of War, a member of the Board of State, and Stiftsbefalingsmand of Ribe stift. In 1670 he was also appointed a member of the Gehejmekonseil (Privy Council), which that year was created as a successor to the Rigsr√•d. Within the new government, he was the leading proponent of the military party, in opposition to Sehested and the Treasury, and an efficient administrator of military affairs. As a reward, he was in 1661 given M√∏gelt√∏nder in fee simple, and became one of the first enfeoffed counts, Lensgreve, when the King in 1671 created that dignity.

The bar was close to the Unity Flats complex and as a result was frequented mostly by Catholics. Background In 1988 both the UVF and the UDA had stepped up their campaigns against the Nationalist community, in part due to receiving a large arms shipment of handguns and assault rifles from South Africa. On 15 January the UVF shot dead Catholic civilian Billy Kane at his home in the New Lodge. The objective of the Avenue Bar attack was to kill a leading Republican from the Unity Flats. The bar had already been targeted by the UVF in 1973 in a bomb attack in which a Catholic pensioner, Francis McNelis, was killed. The shooting The attack happened at 2:20pm when the bar was crowded with Sunday drinkers. Two gunmen walked into the pub after being admitted through an electronic security door. A witness said they at first seemed to be looking for someone, but then opened fire indiscriminately with automatic weapons. People threw glasses at the gunmen in an attempt to fight them off. The gunmen escaped in a car which had been hijacked 20 minutes earlier on the Shankill Road, and which was found abandoned at Carlow Street behind Shankill Leisure Centre shortly after the attack. The three victims were Stephen McGahan (27), from the New Lodge, Damien Devlin (24), from Andersonstown, and Paul McBride (27), from Ardoyne.

Bounded by Glen Avenue to the north, Broad Street to the west, Massasoit Street to the south, and the Providence River to the east, this area was developed between 1900 and 1963 as a streetcar suburb for middle and lower middle class residents on what was once a country estate. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The Sally Greene Homestead Plats area was in the 18th century a landholding of one of Cranston's most prominent families, the Rhodeses. Sally Rhodes Remington Greene inherited the southern third of the family's coastal properties in 1801. This property was purchased in 1869 by Edward Taft, a textile manufacturer who owned an adjacent country estate just to the south. By that time, Broad Street to the west was served by a streetcar line, running between Pawtuxet village to the south and downtown Providence to the north. He promptly resold it to other interests, but eventually repurchasing some parts of it for development. Over a period spanning from 1897 to 1936, the area of the Sally Greene Homestead was platted out for development, which took place roughly from 1900 to 1963. The district's northernmost street is Glen Avenue, where it abuts the Anstis Greene Estate Plats historic district to the north, and is bounded on the south by Massasoit Street, where it abuts the Aberdeen Plat historic district. The house lots in the district are small, ranging in size from 4,000 to 6,000 square feet, although due to irregularities in the terrain, some lots near the water are larger, ranging in size up to 15,000 square feet and commanding views of the waterfront. Most of the houses are between one and 2-1/2 stories in height and of wood frame construction, although there are a few houses where brick or stucco has been applied to the exterior. Stylistically they are diverse, representing styles popular at their time of construction. Setbacks from the street are typically moderate, with small yard spaces on all sides. The only non-residential property is a single commercial building on Broad Street. One 19th-century structure, a barn, is a rare reminder of the area's agrarian past.

The railway is part of European TEN-T route E59 from Scandinavia to Vienna, Budapest and Prague. Opening In 1853 a decision was made to build a railway line connecting Wroc≈Çaw with Pozna≈Ñ. It obtained the concession for the construction Upper Silesian Railway (Oberschlesische Eisenbahn Gesellschaft), and construction started in Leszno, in three directions: to Wroc≈Çaw, Pozna≈Ñ and G≈Çog√≥w. A prototype steam locomotive entered Leszno station from Rawicz on 27 September 1856, and the first regular train service started on 27 October 1856. The ceremonial opening of the line, involving city authorities and residents, took place 29 October 1856. History In the interwar period, Leszno station served as a border control station. On the railway the train service was limited to 2 passenger trains and express train 801/802 between Wroclaw and Gda≈Ñsk. From Poznan, two passenger trains reached Rawicz. Between Leszno and Wroc≈Çaw there were 2 pairs of international passenger trains (without stopping in Lasocice, border control station in Leszno), and 3 pairs of trains to the border at Lasocice from Leszno. Here the border was on the line of today's border of Greater Poland Voivodeship and Lower Silesian Voivodeship. Electrification Electrification of the lines around Leszno took place in three stages: *31 May 1969: - Pozna≈Ñ - Puszczykowko *20 December 1969: Puszczykowko - Leszno *22 April 1970: Leszno - Wroc≈Çaw Modernisation Since 2010 PKP PLK has led the modernisation of railway line E59 between Wroc≈Çaw and Pozna≈Ñ. The project is co-financed by the European Union. As a result of the works, the line speed will be increased up to 160 km/h and thereby travel time on the section between Wroc≈Çaw and Pozna≈Ñ will be 75 minutes (for the fastest trains). In addition, the stations Leszno and Pozna≈Ñ will be the two local traffic control centres. Completion of the work was planned for 2014, but is expected to last until 2020.

One of the works that Burley was tasked with while at Central was the Honor Roll Plaque that recognized students and faculty men in service were fighting. The designs were provided by Sarah Spurgeon, H.J. Whitney and carved by Josephine Burley. The artwork was unveiled on May 30, 1945. Carved on the panel of the Honor Roll Plaque were the words: For those we fought: For Home, an enriched life. For School, an enduring wisdom. For Country, and all humanity. For God, a spirit over all. Burley was also a prize winner for two of her personal works in a Northwest Color Show in Seatlle and the Northwest Arts and Crafts Fair in Bellevue. = Juanita Davies (1895‚Äì1984) = Born in Wisconsin, Juanita Davies graduated at the top of her class from Ripon College before going on to attend Macphail School of Music and summer schools at Music Academy of the West, University of Washington, and University of Colorado. While working toward music degrees from the Chicago Conservatory of Music (B.A. 1932) and Northwestern University (M.A. 1938), Davies taught in Central Washington University's music department from 1927 to 1965. Active in student life, Davies conducted a men's glee club, a women's ensemble, and a women's triple trio in addition to teaching piano, music theory, elementary music teaching methods, and song literature for children. She also appeared as a solo performer and an accompanist for both faculty and student recitals.

The First Seventy- Five Years: A History of Central Washington State College, 1891-1966. Ellensburg, WA: Central Washington State College. The school would later be renamed Hebeler School in honor of Amanda Hebeler's contributions to the teacher training program (3), and is currently known as Hebeler Hall. Amanda Hebeler was born to pioneering parents in the early 1900s in Maple Grove, Michigan. After graduating from Saginaw High School, Hebeler received degrees from Michigan State Normal School in Ypsilanti and received her BS and MA from Teachers College, Columbia University. Hebeler came to what was then known as the Washington State Normal School in 1924 to take on the newly created position of supervisor of student teachers at teacher training centers in the region and throughout the state. She began her work as supervisor of intermediate grades at the (then) Edison School. Within a year, working with Principal Loren Sparks, Hebeler established an off-campus student teacher training program in Selah in 1925.Amanda Hebeler, \\"1924-1952 with Central Washington College of Education at Ellensburg, Washington\\" (Personal memoir, Ellensburg, Washington, undated), p5. Box 1, Folder 49, Brooks Library Archives & Special Collections, Ellensburg, WA. Hebeler's expertise in teacher-training was quickly recognized and in 1929 she was promoted to administer the Edison School by CWSC president George H. Black. In 1931, new president Robert E. McConnell began developing plans for a new training school building. A Public Works Administration grant was secured for the project in 1937, and the entire faculty and staff of the school chimed in with suggested features to the new school. The planning team decided early on that their objective was to design \\"a building which would be beautiful as well as functional in design.\\" Initially called the College Elementary School, the new school was designed to achieve two goals, providing quality education for young area children, and creating a teacher-training laboratory for CWUC early childhood education students. Hebeler played a major role in the design of the school and its curriculum, and was later honored by having the school named for her. Hebeler died of complications from a stroke on June 17, 1969. When officiating at her funeral, Father Paul Fitterer reminisced, \\"I remember her telling me of her very early days here. She had to commute, sometimes daily, down to Selah. That was in the days before the canyon road was paved and she drove a Model \\"T\\"‚Äîthe Normal School car‚Äîby herself and in the middle of winter. She used to tell me how frightened she would be coming back at night by herself. But she never stopped‚Äîshe continued driving back and forth as long was it was necessary.

The excavations aimed at better understanding the iron smelting process and its ritual aspects in East Africa. At the KM2 and KM3 sites, Schmidt tested the hypothesis that the high combustion temperature of furnaces, discovered to be between 1350 to 1400 degree Celsius, was caused by the preheating of air blasts. Preheating has been suggested to be a distinct feature of African Early Iron Age smelting techniques by ethnographic observations of the Haya people of northwestern Tanzania.  Description  = Locations = KM2 site is located 14 m above Lake Victoria on a knoll 500 m west of the Kemondo Bay port facility. It was discovered in early 1977 by a Tanzanian member of Peter Schmidt‚Äôs team as he walked over a newly exposed road surface that had been opened as part of the new Kemondo Bay port access road. The KM3 site is situated 1 km south of KM2 and sits between 75 and 85 m above Lake Victoria. It was discovered during a village survey by a Tanzanian surveyor who observed furnace bricks on a main path bisecting the site. = Radiocardon dating = The radiocarbon dates from the KM2 site are derived from wood charcoal found beneath furnace bricks or slag in the deeper stratigraphic zones of the furnace pits. The KM2 radiocarbon dates show that there are 4 distinct use periods of the site: the first is an occupation period that spans from 300 to 200 BC; the second is an industrial period in 100-200 AD, after which there is a hiatus from 200-300 AD; the third in the 400-500 AD; and the fourth falls from the beginning of 600 AD into early 700 AD. All 10 dates of KM3 site are derived from furnace pits. The dates show that there are three use periods at the KM3 site: the first period is represented by two contiguous furnaces that are dated to the 100-200 AD (or between ca 50 BC and 250 AD); the second during 300 AD, when iron production was performed only in one episode at KM3 and was totally absent at KM2; and the third in 400-500 AD, which was also an active period at KM2, but the end of iron smelting at KM3. During the last use period of KM2 in the 600-700 AD, KM3 site was not used for iron production.  Iron technology  In KM2, the bases of 13 intact and 2 disturbed Early Iron Age furnaces were excavated along with a large industrial refuse pit and iron artifacts. The furnace bowls were lined with earth from termite mounds and the furnace shaft was built with bricks. The furnaces have a mean diameter of 93.6 cm, ranging between 86 and 103 cm in diameter, with 10 of the 11 furnaces between 93 and 103 cm. In KM2, large amounts of industrial debris and domestic pottery were dumped into a refuse pit alongside discarded furnace bricks, slag, tuy√®res, iron fragments, and charcoal. At the KM3 site are mines, slag dumps, ore-processing areas, industrial refuse dumps, and smelting furnaces. Smelting furnaces were abundant, although recent farming practices in the core of the industrial site had disturbed some furnaces. The KM3 furnaces are more consistent in design and contents than the KM2 furnace pits. The furnace bowls are larger and more regular in size than the KM2 furnaces, with a mean diameter of 113.8 cm, ranging only from 112 to 116 cm. The mean depth of 28 cm among KM3 furnace pits is significantly greater than the mean depth of 18 cm at KM2, a difference attributable to the more complete preservation at KM3. The furnace bowls excavated on KM2 and KM3 were filled with a variety of materials, including slag, pieces of partly reduced iron ore, fired bricks used to build the furnace, charcoal, pieces of tuy√®res, as well as some domestic pottery. = Tuy√®res = Preheating of air blasts allowed the furnaces to achieve higher combustion temperatures, which dramatically improved fuel efficiency in the iron production process. Peter Schmidt observed that the Haya in northwestern Tanzania employed the practice of preheating by placing tuy√®res inside their furnaces, which results in hot air blast. The study of KM2 and KM3 sites allowed for the collection of more definitive evidence for prehistoric tuy√®res, in order to discern how and when preheated iron technology developed in Africa. The tuy√®res employed inside the smelting furnace must be made of clay that is highly refractory. The heat transfer through the clay has to be sufficiently high to heat up the air passing through the clay chamber, in order to achieve a higher temperature in the blast zone, which in turns leads to more heat transfer through the clay walls of the tuy√®re. Many small pieces of tuy√®re with physical characteristics indicating their presence inside furnaces were recovered at the KM2 site. The majority of tuy√®re fragments show convincing evidence in their colors to indicate that they were inside the prehistoric smelting furnaces of KM2. The hypothesis that preheating had developed at least by the 400 AD in Africa has been confirmed by the discovery of a 36 cm whole or long section of tuy√®re uncovered in furnace 9 of KM3. The tuy√®re is 40% (14.5 cm) slag-wetted and vitrified, and the slag-wetted section is gray in color, suggesting exposure to oxidation. Other physical properties of the tuy√®re, such as the reduction of clay, also suggest that tuy√®res had been placed inside Early Iron Age furnaces for the preheating of air blast. = Swamp grass = A small pile of charred reeds was found adjacent to furnace 3 in KM2, and since furnace bowls tend to be cleared out after smelting, this serves as the most direct evidence for the use of swamp grass in the iron production process. Ethnographic study of the Haya people in Northwestern Tanzania shows that swamp grass is burned in the furnace bowl until the bowl is filled with the charred swamp reeds. When the iron ore melts above the tuy√®res, it forms a molten slag with carbon inclusions. The slag then interacts with the fibrous, carbonaceous bed provided by the burned swamp grass, which in turn provides an extremely high carbon-slag contact area for the subsequent carburization of the bloom. The charred reeds also allow the draining of slag from the blast zone, as the slag runs down the inside of the grass stalks and through the spaces between the reeds to the bottom of the furnace pit. = Termite linings = 60% of the KM2 furnaces were lined with termite earth, but only one of the KM3 furnaces had traces of an artificial liner. It is uncertain if furnace liners were not as common at KM3 or if they had been removed from furnaces. The earth of a termite mound is more refractory than normal soil because termites select quartz sand grains from the subsoil to build their mounds. Termite mound soil is used as insulation, and employed for its resistance to fusion with slag.  Ritual medicine  = Furnace holes = Of the 15 furnace bowls excavated at the KM2 site, six had a small hole in the floor. Ethnographic evidence suggests that iron smelters excavated holes in their furnaces in order to place in it magical devices or ritual medicine. Sometimes these ritual objects were used to increase productivity or to protect against sinister forces that might disrupt the smelt. The properties of the ritual materials are those that the smelters hoped to impart to the iron bloom. = Iron bloom = Of the seven furnaces excavated at KM3, only furnace number 8, dated to 100 AD, has shown evidence of ritual modification. In the furnace floor, a small pit was discovered that contained a 6-cm-tall piece of prehistoric iron bloom, which was shown to have no relationship to the technological operation of the furnace. Later metallurgical analysis of the iron bloom shows evidence that the piece of iron had been produced by a smelting process that had formed large, dense, relatively slag-free bloom. The placement of this unprocessed iron in the pit evokes ethnographic comparison to iron smelting rituals that ensure the production of high-quality iron that mimics the attribute of the ritual device.

The event began on December 2, 2014, with The Flash episode \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" and concluded the next day with the Arrow episode \\"The Brave and The Bold\\". The crossover sees Team Flash (Barry Allen / Flash, Caitlin Snow, and Cisco Ramon) helping Team Arrow (Oliver Queen / Arrow, Felicity Smoak, and John Diggle) take on the boomerang-wielding villain Captain Boomerang, while Team Arrow helps Team Flash confront the metahuman Roy Bivolo. A crossover between the two series was announced in July 2014, after Barry Allen had been introduced in Arrows second season ahead of the debut of The Flash. By the following September, the scripts for each episode had been written, with filming occurring shortly before the end of the month and into October 2014. The crossover sees every main cast member of each series who appear at least in their own series, with additional actors and characters also reprising their Arrowverse roles. The episodes received positive reviews, with critics calling the crossover fun, and everything fans could have wanted and more. Critics praised the producers for bringing the two series together while keeping the episodes as self-contained adventures, and highlighted the fight scene between the Flash and Arrow as living up to the hype. Ratings for the episodes were exceptional, with both being the highest watched episodes of each show since their respective series premieres. A subsequent crossover occurred the following year titled \\"Heroes Join Forces\\".  Plot  Roy Bivolo, a metahuman with the power to send people into an uncontrollable rage, uses his powers to rob the Central City bank. Police detective Eddie Thawne proposes to capture the Flash because he was at the crime scene, but is rejected by the captain. The police track Bivolo to a warehouse, where he uses his powers on a cop to facilitate his escape. Barry Allen arrives to save Joe West, but is almost injured himself before Oliver Queen, as the \\"Arrow\\" vigilante, arrives to stop the cop. Later, Oliver informs Barry that he and his team are in Central City tracking down intel on a killer who uses lethal steel boomerangs. Barry and his friends suggests that they team-up to catch each other's targets and Oliver reluctantly agrees. Oliver tries to teach Barry to be more mindful of his surroundings, but Barry decides to go after Bivolo by himself. Bivolo uses his ability on Barry's mind; but because of Barry's speed, its effects last longer. Eddie continues to persuade his superiors to form a task force unit to capture the Flash, expressing his zero tolerance for vigilantes. When an enraged Barry, as the Flash, attacks Eddie, Oliver tries to stop Barry, and the two engage in a fight. Oliver manages to wrangle Barry long enough for Harrison Wells and Joe to use strobe light to reset Barry's emotional state. Afterward, Barry and Oliver capture Bivolo and place him in the pipeline prison at S.T.A.R. Labs. Due to the incident, Eddie forms a task unit to arrest the Flash. Barry confirms Oliver's belief that the former has still a lot to learn. Oliver advises him to stay away from Iris West, with whom Barry is in love, for a while, because men with secret identities as vigilantes never get the girl. Oliver asks Team Flash to keep his alter ego as the Arrow, a secret. A new mysterious metahuman able to manipulate fire appears in Central City. In a flashback set in Hong Kong, Oliver learns how to torture suspects to gain information. In the present, Oliver and Roy Harper locate Digger Harkness, the boomerang-wielding killer, where they find A.R.G.U.S. operatives looking for him as well. Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon arrive in Starling City to help Felicity Smoak investigate Sara Lance's homicidal murderer. Digger attempts to kill Lyla Michaels, Roy, and Oliver, but Barry instantly arrives and stops him. Later, Lyla reveals that Digger was part of the Suicide Squad. When Oliver uses his extreme interrogation methods on a Russian mob member in order to locate Digger, Barry questions how emotionally stable Oliver is with his past tragedies to torture people. Digger locates Oliver's base and wounds Lyla before escaping immediately. In order to leave town, Digger plants five bombs around the city. While Oliver captures Digger, Barry uses both of their teams to defuse the bombs simultaneously. Digger is incarcerated on Lian Yu with Slade Wilson. Before Barry and his team's departure to Central City, Cisco and Caitlin gives Oliver his suit improvements and utilities, him and Oliver learned both of their lessons and decide to have a friendly duel.

Tarabay as Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang  Production  = Development = The first indication of potential crossover events in the Arrowverse occurred on The CW during the 2013‚Äì14 television season, when Barry Allen was introduced in the eighth episode of Arrows second season ahead of the debut of The Flash. In July 2014, it was announced that the eighth episodes of the third season of Arrow and the first season of The Flash would be a two-hour crossover event. The crossover was originally planned as the seventh episodes of each series, but was pushed back due to the large amount of work needed to accomplish it. In particular, the schedule coordination of trying to \\"jam another episode into the 23-episode schedule for each of [the] shows.\\" Marc Guggenheim, creator and executive producer on Arrow, explained that there was \\"no financially responsible\\" way of executing the crossover, with budgets being blown, long hours and the actors having to film scenes from both series on the same day. Andrew Kreisberg, creator and executive producer on both series, said, \\"It's really going to be an adventure with the Arrow and Flash on both episodes. Watching the two teams come together and fight alongside each other, it's one of the most fun parts, ... we just don‚Äôt believe in waiting. We really believe in accelerated storytelling.\\" Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; \\"So, the idea that [the Flash and Arrow] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas.\\" Greg Berlanti, creator and executive producer on both series, explained that \\"crossovers are part of [the characters'] DNA, ... and if we waited ..., then we would be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see\\". In October 2014, Kreisberg described the episodes as very important to both Barry and Oliver and what they are going thorough, while also promising \\"one of the biggest surprises for Arrow of all time in The Flash episode\\". Guggenheim added, \\"It's like the bomb underneath the table, and I think part of the fun is waiting to see when Oliver is going to learn what the audience learns on Flash.\\" It was later announced that another secret would be revealed in the final moments of The Flash episode that will help \\"introduce the next phase of The Flash in a big way\\". In the episode, Oliver runs into an ex-girlfriend, last seen pregnant with his child in season two of Arrow and had been told by Oliver's mother Moira to tell him that she'd lost the baby and disappear. It is revealed to the viewers that she has a child and it's presumed to be Oliver's. After the airing of the episode, Guggenheim confirmed that indeed it was Oliver's child. At the end of the episode, Robbie Amell, who played Ronnie Raymond‚ÄîCaitlin's former fianc√©e presumed dead after the particle accelerator explosion‚Äîappears as Firestorm using his powers. In 2019, looking back at the crossover, Guggenheim recalled it seemed \\"so hard at the time\\" but in comparison to later crossovers, \\"it was embarrassingly easy... but the two storylines of each episode were relatively separate from each other. So, it wasn‚Äôt that narratively ambitious.\\" = Writing = The scripts for the \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" crossover were written in mid-September 2014, with Berlanti and Kreisberg creating the story for the two episodes. Berlanti drew inspiration from science fiction action television series The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman for the story, while Kreisberg took his cues from the final episode of the fourth series of Doctor Who, titled \\"Journey's End\\", a crossover featuring the characters of spin-off shows Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures. The teleplay for The Flash was written by Ben Sokolowski and Brooke Eikmeier, with Arrows written by executive producers Guggenheim and Grainne Godfree. In late September 2014, Guggenheim revealed that the Arrow episode would be titled \\"The Brave and The Bold\\", a reference to a title shared by many comic book series published by DC Comics which feature super-hero team-ups, including the Flash and Green Arrow. Guggenheim said: > I've never had so much fun writing a script before[.] ... It was such a > blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. > It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the > opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. > What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea? There are moments like that, > that you just can‚Äôt do in a normal episode....It's just so much fun. In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\". Kreisberg revealed that the writers' rooms for both shows were merged while working on the scripts for the episodes, similar to \\"throwing two casts together\\". Both episodes were written as self-contained, with Kriesberg explaining, \\"[W]e were very conscious of not everybody who was watching Flash was watching Arrow and vice versa, so we wanted to make sure they both were self-contained episodes\\". = Filming = Filming of the two episodes occurred from September 24, 2014, until October 8, 2014. The Flashs episode was directed by Glen Winter, and Arrows by Jesse Warn. The fight scene between the Flash and Arrow in The Flash episode was shot over three nights. Because this was the first time Stephen Amell's character fought someone with superpowers, he had to change the way he performed stunts to accommodate the special effects. Comparing the filming of both series, Grant Gustin described The Flash shooting as \\"really tedious,\\" working with \\"a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we are going to be in\\" and later added in post- production, as opposed to Arrow where \\"they shoot it from the perfect angles and what you see is what you get\\". Gustin also recalled at times it got confusing on set because they were shooting both episodes at the same time.  Music  On December 18, 2014, WaterTower Music released a selection of music from The Flash/Arrow crossover episodes, as well as two bonus tracks from their respective 2014 mid-season finales. Discussing the challenge of merging the themes of both shows into a cohesive score, composer Blake Neely noted that \\"It wasn‚Äôt difficult because I originally designed the two shows to have styles and sounds that could merge and live together when necessary, but also hopefully stand alone as two distinct music worlds.\\" The two bonus tracks were included on the album because \\"they proved very popular with the fans of the special event\\". Neely said, \\"As we were coming to completion and [the album] was about to go, I got all these tweets about these two pieces that people were loving, [and] I just had this idea, let's throw them on as bonus tracks... The fans asked for it and they got it.\\" All music composed by Blake Neely.  Release  = Broadcast = The \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" crossover episodes were shown at an exclusive fan screening at the Crest Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles on November 22, 2014. Afterwards, Amell, Gustin, David Ramsey, Emily Bett Rickards, Danielle Panabaker and Carlos Valdes were joined by executive producers Berlanti, Kreisberg and Guggenheim for a Q&A; panel. The first part of the crossover, The Flash, was broadcast on December 2, 2014, followed by part two on Arrow on December 3, both on The CW. The crossover was simulcast with the US broadcast in Canada on CTV. It first aired in the United Kingdom on Channel 5 on December 16 and December 18, 2014. In Australia, the episodes aired back-to-back on January 28, 2015, on Fox8, after Nine Network, which broadcasts Arrow, allowed Fox8 to air the Arrow episode of the crossover. = Home media = The episodes, along with the rest of The Flashs first season and Arrows third season, were released separately on Blu-ray and DVD on September 22, 2015. Bonus features include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The episodes became available for streaming on Netflix on October 6 and October 7, 2015, respectively.  Reception  =Ratings= The Flash episode had the second-highest number of viewers following the series premiere on October 7, 2014, and the highest 18-49 rating since the second episode. Viewership rose 22% and the 18-49 rating by 14%, over the previous episode, \\"Power Outage\\". The Arrow episode was the most viewed of season three, and had the show's largest audience since the series' premiere on October 10, 2012, and a series high 18‚Äì49 rating. Its viewership grew by 46% and its 18-49 rating by 56% over the previous episode, \\"Draw Back Your Bow\\", and helped contribute to the most watched Wednesday on The CW in more than two years. The Canadian broadcast of The Flash was watched by 2.45 million viewers, earning the highest viewership for the week. The Arrow broadcast had 2.22 million viewers, the second highest for that day, and the fourth highest for the week. In the United Kingdom, the episodes had 1.5 million viewers and 980,000 viewers, respectively. The time shifted versions attracted a total of 1.63 million and 1.26 million viewers, respectively. After the crossover aired, both shows saw increases to their ratings compared to their respective episodes before the crossover. The Flash \\"surprising[ly]\\" dipped a mere 6% in the 18‚Äì49 rating and rose 4% in total viewers, from the crossover episode, on \\"a heavily competitive night\\" for its most watched episode since its series premiere. The following Arrow episode dropped by 29% in the 18‚Äì49 rating, from the crossover episode. However, compared to its episode before the crossover, Arrow rose in the 18‚Äì49 rating, tying its second best rating of the season, behind only the crossover episode with The Flash. = Critical response = After the first Arrow/Flash crossover, Brian Lowry of Variety applauded the producers for replicating the success of Arrow, but with \\"a lighter tone,\\" and \\"a hero with genuine super powers\\" in The Flash. He noted while the crossover \\"does a nifty job of bringing the two series together\\" it was unlikely \\"to boost the shared audience between them much more than already exists\\". Meredith Borders of Birth.Movies.Death called the crossover episodes \\"fun,\\" noting that...\\"plenty of show-specific plot stuff was advanced without spelling it out for newbies. New viewers to either show could follow along and have a good time, but veteran viewers were rewarded with major storyline motion.\\" Chancellor Agard, of Entertainment Weekly felt \\"the 'Flarrow\\" crossover event was an overall success. Both episodes \\"put Team Flash in new situations and it was thrilling to watch how they reacted\\". Agard felt that while Arrow had \\"some great and comedic character moments for Team Arrow\\" none of its stories were advanced so that the episodes \\"felt like pause buttons\\" in its action.  The Flash  The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 21 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Flash pulls off a thrilling crossover with its sibling series, Arrow, by skillfully blending the two shows' disparate tones and showcasing its dueling superheroes' complementing strengths.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode a 7.8 out of 10. He said the \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" episode was \\"fun\\" with its focus \\"on the sheer entertainment value in seeing these two heroes and their allies cross paths\\"... and \\"to see the relationship between Barry and Ollie continue to evolve\\". As \\"a largely standalone episode\\" its scope was limited resulting \\"in yet another underdeveloped villain.\\" Scott Von Doviak writing for The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A-\\", calling it \\"a satisfying showdown\\" that \\"actually stands on its own as a mostly self- contained hour of The Flash\\". Von Doviak complimented writers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, and director Glen Winter, for tackling the \\"clashing tones of the two shows\\" and the different personalities of their main characters, and \\"weaving...[them]... into the fabric of the episode\\". He also highlighted the fight scene between the Flash and Arrow, saying \\"It's a well- choreographed battle, with each hero appearing to have the upper hand at various points and clever bits of one-upmanship.\\" Collider's Dave Trumbore gave The Flash episode an \\"A-\\", saying, it was \\"fun\\" seeing the characters together. He noted that the episode pointed out the many challenges Barry Allen \\"faces as a young up-and-coming crimefighter\\". He felt that Arrow's \\"knocks\\" made the point that \\"Barry's superpowers are an amazing gift ... he must hone and perfect to become a truly heroic character.\\" Trumbore also \\"loved how Arrow's attention to detail and commitment to bettering himself through training clashed with Flash's carefree style and almost lazy attitude when it came to beating up baddies\\". Agard's expectations for the episode were \\"not disappointed\\". He felt it delivered \\"on both the action front\\" with its impeccable, \\"epic\\" fight scene, and \\"on the character front\\". While the viewer can enjoy the interaction between the teams everything that happens in the episode pushes \\"this The Flashs stories forward\\". Eric Walters of Paste awarded The Flash episode a 9.0 out of 10, stating, \\"\\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" was everything a fan could have wanted from a crossover event,\\" noting it was \\"tight, well-paced, superbly written and, most importantly, fun...\\". Caroline Preece of Den of Geek also praised the episode, saying that it \\"was pretty much everything fans wanted and more\\". She noted this episode demonstrated how comic book ideas \\"can translate to the small screen if done with this much care, joy and enthusiasm\\". Given the \\"hype\\" she admired, and was \\"surprised\\" by the fact that even \\"with a little added Oliver, Felicity and Diggle thrown in,\\" the crossover was not the focus of the whole episode.  Arrow  Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating, based on 18 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"This Arrowverse crossover episode manages to entertain while posing thoughtful questions about morality ‚Äì and all without getting bogged down in meta references.\\" Giving the episode a 9.2 out of 10, Schedeen stated it was a \\"blast to watch\\" and was \\"a more cohesive and satisfying episode than the first\\". Noting that the crossover \\"wasted some of its potential by delivering two mostly standalone episodes,\\" the Arrow episode was \\"more consistently entertaining and satisfying than the first\\". He enjoyed Captain Boomerang suggesting he could be the \\"most memorable villain to debut this season\\". Schedeen enjoyed the teams continuing to cross paths, the drama between Barry and Ollie, and \\"the balance between light and dark [the crossover] needed\\". Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A-\\", saying it \\"..can just cut loose and have some ['effortless'] fun for an hour,\\" noting that Barry \\"is one of the only characters able to call Oliver out on his more mopey strains of bullshit\\". He felt it was \\"fitting\\" the episode \\"shared the name‚Äî\\"The Brave And The Bold\\"‚Äîwith DC Comics' long-running team-up comic\\". The Flash is \\"the brave one\\", who \\"inspires with his courage\\" though his \\"simplistic sense of right and wrong\\" can lead him to overlook \\"the darker side of what they do\\". Oliver is \\"the bold one\\", \\"willing to do whatever it takes to see justice served\\". Trumbore felt the episode of Arrow closed out the crossover \\"in spectacular fashion\\" and gave it an \\"A\\". He noted that \\"both heroes channel their respective cities into their character\\". Barry Allen's approach to crimefighting is effervescent and \\"carefree\\" reflecting \\"Central City's cutting-edge technology\\" and \\"squeaky-clean streets\\". \\"Queen's Starling City\\" with its \\"ruthless underworld\\" is \\"much like the personality of the masked crimefighter himself\\". He felt the writing was clever in that it allowed the characters to \\"clash at times, but also ... allow[ed] them to come together in pursuit of a common goal\\". However, Agard felt Arrow \\"was a decent enough episode\\", but not \\"as good as the first\\". \\"The Brave and the Bold'... felt... like a crossover episode ... servic[ing] Oliver's identity issues and character development.\\" Agrad felt that \\"Cisco fanboying all over the place\\" is \\"fun\\" and Captain Boomerang is a \\"most formidable and compelling opponent\\" because he uses strategy and plans multiple steps ahead\\". Mark Rozeman at Paste, gave the Arrow episode a 9.3 out of 10, saying, the episode \\"not only equals its brother episode but, in some ways, manages to surpass it\\". He saw it as season's \\"strongest\\" Arrow episode, and \\"a great conclusion to the very successful Arrow/The Flash crossover\\" where in an \\"emotionally charged hour...all the elements come together with remarkable dexterity\\". He felt the shows' creative teams should be \\"applauded\\" for avoiding a \\"half-assed bid for ratings\\" instead turning the crossover \\"into something that brought out the best of each show\\". Rozeman argued that if \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" proves that The Flash can stand on its own, then \\"The Brave and the Bold\\" is \\"a great demonstration that Arrow has some fire in it yet.\\" Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini said the episode is \\"a remarkably self-contained adventure\\". Noting that both episodes worked well as standalones, \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" was \\"very clearly an episode\\" of The Flash and \\"The Brave and The Bold\\" is \\"absolutely an Arrow episode ... handily the best installment of Arrow season three so far\\". He felt the cinematic scoring was \\"great\\" giving the episode 4.5 stars out of 5. = Accolades = TVLine named the \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" crossover the 9th biggest television moment of 2014 saying, \\"There are crossovers. And there are superhero shows. But never in recent TV memory have two live-action costumed crimefighters clashed in super fashion (albeit under extenuating circumstances). The Flashs smooth moves versus Arrows strength and stratagem made for a thrilling tango that lived up to the hype.\\" IGN ranked the showdown between the Flash and Arrow in The Flash episode as one of the best television fight scenes of 2014. ScreenRant named both \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\" and \\"The Brave and the Bold\\" as one of the best television episodes of 2014.

Plot Gary Godspeed is a boisterous yet inept astronaut who, in the midst of working off the last few days of his five-year sentence aboard the prison spacecraft Galaxy One, encounters a mysterious planet-destroying alien. He befriends the alien, naming him Mooncake, and then discovers that Mooncake is wanted by the forces of a powerful telekinetic creature known as the Lord Commander. Gary and Mooncake embark on a quest to save the universe, together with the ship's computer HUE, an army of similar but unfalteringly loyal robots, and a growing crew of new shipmates‚Äîall while trying to uncover the mystery of what \\"Final Space\\" really is.

Olan Rogers uploaded the first episode of a planned ten-part animated web-series titled Gary Space to his personal YouTube channel. The project went on hiatus three episodes in, and Rogers eventually explained on Facebook that both he and the series' artist, Dan Brown, were tending to separate projects at the time, but were in talks of continuing. On April 30, 2013, Rogers confirmed that he was rebooting and producing a season of Gary Space episodes to release at once. Over two years later, Rogers revealed that a new short for the reboot for Gary Space was planned to be pitched to Cartoon Network, in addition to premiering the episode at Buffer Festival if nothing came from the pitch. In early 2016, Rogers announced that his project had been retitled Final Space ‚Äì he cited it due to avoid similarities with Steven Universefrom Roger's thread in a Q&A; on Twitter ‚Äì ‚Äì and revealed screenshots of the short via a vlog on his YouTube channel. The pilot for Final Space was posted on Rogers' YouTube channel with voices by himself and a friend of his, Coty Galloway; Galloway had collaborated with Rogers in a Star Wars fan film called The Scarlet Lance.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvCPI4AcuqQ The video caught the attention of Conan O'Brien, who invited him to Los Angeles to pitch Final Space to TBS as a full series and also joined production as an executive producer alongside Rogers and 3rd Rock from the Sun writer and producer David Sacks. Other members of O'Brien's company, Conaco (David Kissinger, Larry Sullivan and Jeff Ross), and members of New Form who executive produced the pilot short (Kathleen Grace, Melissa Schneider and Matt Hoklotubbe) joined as executive producers as well. To balance out Rogers' inexperience in the industry, Conaco brought in Sacks to also serve as the showrunner for the series. After two weeks of working with Sacks and Jake Sidwell (co-composer of the series alongside Shelby Merry) on the pitch, Rogers and Sacks pitched the show to TBS; as well as Comedy Central, Fox, FX, YouTube, and Fullscreen; all six companies wanted the series and resulted in a bidding war between the studios over the series, with TBS acquiring the series. = Casting = Olan Rogers announced in December 2016 that he voices the main characters, Gary and Mooncake. In July 2017, an additional cast list of Fred Armisen, Conan O'Brien, Keith David, Coty Galloway (reprising from the pilot), Tom Kenny, Caleb McLaughlin, John DiMaggio, Ron Perlman, Shannon Purser, Andy Richter, David Tennant, and Steven Yeun was revealed. = Animation = Animation for the series is handled by ShadowMachine in Los Angeles and outsourced to Canadian studio Jam Filled using the Toon Boom Harmony software. The show uses NASA space imagery for the space backgrounds. =Future= When asked on Twitter about the series' longevity, Olan Rogers had stated that he had at least six seasons worth of material thought up for the show including an ending for Final Space in case the series gets cancelled in the future. Promotion and release When responding to a question on Twitter, Olan Rogers revealed that Final Space would be showcased by TBS at San Diego Comic- Con and VidCon in 2017. Final Space premiered on Reddit on February 15, 2018, followed by an AMA with Rogers. This would mark a first for a TV network to premiere a series on the site. Later that day, the first two episodes became available on TBS's website and app. TBS's sister network TNT aired a sneak peek premiere of the show on February 17, 2018, after the 2018 NBA All-Star Weekend. After airing on TBS, the pilot aired two hours later on TBS' sister channel Cartoon Network under its adult-oriented programming block Adult Swim; the rest of the season also aired on the channel in a similar fashion. On February 20, 2018, the first two episodes were released on iTunes. Netflix handles the international distribution to the show and released it on its platform on July 20. On May 7, 2018, Final Space was renewed for a second season, which was later confirmed by Rogers to consist of 13 episodes and for a third season on September 30, 2019. On April 7, 2019, Rogers revealed that the show would move first-run airings to Adult Swim while being simulcast on TBS, a reversal of the airing pattern from the first season. A three-disc Blu- ray containing the entire seasons 1 and 2 was released on August 11, 2020 by Warner Archive Collection. Reception The first season of Final Space received mixed or average reviews, with critics praising the show's cast (especially David Tennant's voice performance as the Lord Commander). On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season currently holds an approval rating of 70% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"Final Space doesn't always hit its mark, but for those looking for a bite-sized intergalactic comedy it may prove an amusing diversion.\\" The show also holds a score of 60 of 100 based on 5 critics on Metacritic, indicating mixed or average reviews. Impressions about the first episodes were also mixed, with criticism focused on Gary's humor. Collider's Dave Trumbore gave the series four out of five stars, praising the cast, the series' uniqueness and its originality. The Hollywood Reporter said \\"the new animated series from TBS misses the mark, and will likely will float off into space\\". The A.V. Club gave the series a C+ grade. Reviewing the first two episodes, Den of Geek gave them a score of 3.5 out of 5 stars. IndieWire gave a B+ grade. The Daily Beast received the series favorably, comparing its potential with Adventure Time and BoJack Horseman. Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times praised the show for the space backgrounds and Gary's relationship with Mooncake, but criticized for being \\"not as clever as Futurama or The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or Galaxy Quest, series with which it shares certain features\\" and for the comedy which \\"leans toward things adolescent boys find funny.\\" Screen Rant was favorable for the series, praising TBS' decision to release the first two episodes 11 days before the series premiere, and describing it as a \\"very silly comedy,\\" comparing protagonist Gary to Homer Simpson and Philip J. Fry.

In addition to providing nursing services, she founded the Old People's Welfare Association, was instrumental in developing the pre- school program and established a consumer protection association on the island. An educational scholarship is granted in her name and she was honored by a stamp depicting her likeness. Early life Patricia Constance Wilhelmina Haines was born on 24 October 1907 in Saint Anthony Parish, Montserrat to Jane (n√©e Bell) and F. W. Haines. Her mother, of Irish descent, was an immigrant from Antigua and her father was an English rector who served as canon of Saint Anthony Parish for forty years. Haines, as was customary for her time, was educated in England, taking nursing classes at St Thomas' Hospital and Battersea Maternity Hospital in London. Career In 1939, Haines returned to the Caribbean and began working as Matron at the Roseau Hospital of Dominica. She then worked at Antigua's Holberton Hospital and Nevis' Alexandra Hospital, before marrying Dr. Charles Norman Griffin in 1942. After her marriage, Griffin lived in various of the Leeward Islands where her husband worked as a physician and in England. The couple had three children, Mary Patricia and Elizabeth Constance, who were born in Antigua and a son, John. Mary became an art teacher and worked to develop the art program at the Montserrat Secondary School, in Plymouth, Montserrat. Elizabeth would become the first woman lawyer of Montserrat and her son, John, would become an English physician. In 1964, the family returned to Montserrat, where Griffin worked as a nurse in her husband's surgery. In 1964, Griffin founded the Old People's Welfare Association (OPWA) to care for disabled or special needs youth and elderly citizens over 70 years of age. She organized the OPWA by dividing the country into districts and assigned scouts to evaluate lack of care, housing, and nutrition in these vulnerable populations. Serving as chief fundraiser of the organization she raised money to provide in-home care or home repair for citizens unable to provide for themselves. She designed a resident project for the elderly which she envisioned would have nine cottages, as well as community services. She raised funds for four units and the government funded an additional two units. Griffin served as an executive of the Red Cross and for the YWCA, and helped establish the first pre-school program on the island. Her work with these organizations led to the development between 1966 and 1972 of the Montserrat Consumers Association, with the goals of increasing education about consumer goods. The organization addressed such things as nutrition and quality of goods, publishing a periodical known as Consumer Concern. When her husband died in 1976, Griffin moved to England to be near her son. Death and legacy Griffin died in 1986 in Darwen, Lancashire, England. In 1987, her children established the Norman and Patricia Griffin Trust Fund to assist secondary and tertiary students on the island with educational scholarships. In 2006, she was posthumously honored by a stamp issued by the Government of Montserrat, recognizing her contributions to the social welfare of the island.

The site is located in the Toyohira neighborhood of Chino, at the foot of Mount Yatsugatake at an altitude of 1000 meters. Over 50 mid-J≈çmon period ruins are located in the foot of the Yatsugatake mountain area near the center of Nagano prefecture because of abundant spring water. Although the ruins were known since the Meiji period, they were first excavated by the archaeologist Hidekazu Miyasaka in 1929. At that time, the foundation of 33 pit dwellings arranged in a U-shape around a central plaza were discovered, along with numerous artifacts, including earthenware, stoneware, jewelry and obsidian tools. This was the first confirmed example of a J≈çmon period settlement found, and was thus the forerunner of the study of that period of Japanese history.

At the time the island was a British colony. The daughter of Alfred Edwin Moseley, Mary was also the granddaughter of Edwin Charles Moseley, who founded the Nassau Guardian. She was educated at the Church High School in Nassau and by private tutor.  Editor  The Nassau Guardian first appeared on November 23, 1844 to support the anti-slavery views of its founder. Mary Moseley became editor and manager of the Nassau Guardian following the deaths of her father, Alfred Edwin Moseley, and shortly thereafter her brother Percy in 1904. Reportedly, she had been appointed to the editor's post \\"on a 'temporary basis' until a suitable male could be found to edit and manage the publishing business.\\" In 1907, she officially became owner of the business and served as the publication's editor and owner for 48 years. During World War I, Moseley went to England to advocate for war survivors from the West Indies and The Bahamas. During her time abroad, Mary's brother Daniel ran the enterprise so she could return to her editorial duties on her return. Readership wasn't large, averaging only about 300 readers a day with topics primarily covering social and legislative issues. For example, she was rigorous in covering the House of Assembly issues. In fact, the paper's day-to-day financial foundation was largely built on the government printing contracts that Moseley was able to win using her influential contacts. While looking for an editorial successor, Moseley identified a nephew, Australian Doyle Moseley, to take her place. Before the start of World War II, Doyle traveled to Nassau and joined the staff for a short time before enlisting in The Royal Air Force to fight. Unfortunately, Doyle was killed in the war during a raid over France. Mary Moseley continued her work at the paper until 1952 when she sold the enterprise to a group of Nassau businessmen. From that time on, she continued to serve as an editorial adviser. According to the Nassau Guardian, she died on January 19, 1961, at the age of 81. Other sources say she died in 1960.  Other activities  In 1926, Moseley published the first edition of The Bahamas Handbook featuring the island's history, geography and society. She served as a trustee for the Nassau Public Library and Museum; she later became chair of the trusteeship committee. She was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire by King George V.

It has much higher water solubility than does estradiol. Glucuronides are the most abundant estrogen conjugates. When exogenous estradiol is administered orally, it is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (95%) in the intestines and liver. A single administered dose of estradiol is absorbed 15% as estrone, 25% as estrone sulfate, 25% as estradiol glucuronide, and 25% as estrone glucuronide. Formation of estrogen glucuronide conjugates is particularly important with oral estradiol as the percentage of estrogen glucuronide conjugates in circulation is much higher with oral ingestion than with parenteral estradiol. Estradiol glucuronide can be converted back into estradiol, and a large circulating pool of estrogen glucuronide and sulfate conjugates serves as a long-lasting reservoir of estradiol that effectively extends its elimination half-life of oral estradiol. In demonstration of the importance of first-pass metabolism and the estrogen conjugate reservoir in the pharmacokinetics of estradiol, the elimination half-life of oral estradiol is 13 to 20 hours whereas with intravenous injection its elimination half-life is only about 1 to 2 hours. Approximately 7% of estradiol is excreted in the urine as estradiol glucuronide. Estradiol glucuronide is transported into prostate gland, testis, and breast cells by OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP1C1, and OATP3A1. The ABC transporters MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, and BCRP, as well as several other transporters, have been found to transport estradiol glucuronide out of cells. The circulating concentrations of estrogen glucuronides are generally more than 10-fold lower than those of estrone sulfate, the most abundant estrogen conjugate in the circulation. Estradiol glucuronide has been identified as an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a membrane estrogen receptor. This may be involved in estradiol glucuronide-induced cholestasis. Estrogen glucuronides can be deglucuronidated into the corresponding free estrogens by Œ≤-glucuronidase in tissues that express this enzyme, such as the mammary gland. As a result, estrogen glucuronides have estrogenic activity via conversion into estrogens. Estradiol glucuronide shows about 300-fold lower potency in activating the estrogen receptors relative to estradiol in vitro. The positional isomer of estradiol glucuronide, estradiol 3-glucuronide, also occurs as a major endogenous metabolite of estradiol, circulating at two-thirds of the levels of estrone sulfate when it reaches its maximal concentrations just before ovulation and during the peak in estradiol levels that occurs at this time.

There are said to be 10,000 black bears in Japan. The population of black bears on Shikoku and Kyushu may be endangered or extinct. There is a high price on bear parts in the black market, which threatens all bear populations in Japan. This particular species of bear are typically smaller with males only reaching and females only weighing about . Their body length is about long.  Diet  Bear eating plants in the area of Mount Norikura These bears are typically herbivorous, eating mainly grasses and herbs during the spring. During the summer, they switch to berries and nuts to feed themselves for their hibernation. The bear is able to get the berries and nuts by climbing trees and using their claws to grab the food. These animals can be omnivorous and eat other wild animals and livestock when there is a need.(Hazumi 1994) Like other bears, cannibalism occurs, as has been demonstrated when bone fragments and claws of a cub were found inside the stomach of a male black bear.  Habitat  In the area of Mount Kurai The bears live on three Japanese islands: Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. They can be found in the northeastern high snow region and the southwestern low snow region; however, they have been spotted as high as the alpine region more than high. They tend to live in areas where there is an abundance of grasses and trees with berries to support their diet.  Seed dispersal  Forests rely on bears as a great method for plants and trees to spread their seeds. The bears will consume the seeds and move 40% further than a distance of 500 m from the parent tree. They have the potential to spread seeds over huge areas, helping the plant life spread throughout the area. In autumn, the bears have a greater seed dispersal rate and usually the males have a larger dispersal areas than females.(Koike, S. 2011)  Conservation  There has been a huge impact on Japanese black bears' populations due to human interference. Habitat destruction is a problem for these bears as peoples' villages begin to grow. Over-hunting and poaching is also a problem. Bears' parts can be sold on the black market for a high price, which makes them very desirable. People kill a lot of these bears, reducing their numbers drastically. Because of this and the carrying capacity reduction due to habitat destruction has resulted in the recognition that the Japanese black bear is at a high risk of extinction. The species will likely be gone within the next 100 years at the rate they are currently declining.(Horino, S. 2000)  References   Bibliography   Asiatic black bears Mammals of Japan ","title":"Japanese black bear"},{"id":"52475964","text":"Lamarcus Brutus (born February 10, 1993) is an American football safety who is currently a free agent. He played college football at Florida State and signed with the Tennessee Titans in 2016. College career In 2012, as a redshirt freshman, Brutus played in six games mainly on special teams on the kickoff coverage team. In 2013, the redshirt sophomore saw action in 11 of FSU's 14 games as a backup defensive back and special teams contributor. He continued to expand his role with the Seminoles after a redshirt season in 2011. He set a then career high with six tackles ‚Äì all solo ‚Äì against Syracuse. In 2014, the fourth-year junior emerged as a productive reserve in the secondary, appearing in all 14 games. Brutus played as a safety in FSU's dime package, finishing with 15 tackles, two interceptions and a pass breakup. His first career interception came in the second quarter off Florida's Treon Harris and led to an FSU TD for a 21‚Äì9 lead. He later picked off Georgia Tech's Justin Thomas in the fourth quarter with 3:22 to play in the ACC Championship Game. In 2015, the fifth-year senior worked his way into the starting lineup at free safety in his final season at Florida State. Brutus started all 13 games as one of the veteran leaders on the defensive side of the ball. He had a team- high three interceptions on the year, including one at Georgia Tech that was returned 57 yards and led to the only Seminole touchdown of the game. Brutus' three interceptions tied for seventh-most in the ACC, while his 94 return yards led the conference. He was voted Honorable Mention All-ACC by the media. Brutus finished third on the team in total tackles with 68 stops (46 solo), second only to freshman All-American Derwin James in unassisted tackles (52). Professional career The Titans signed Brutus as a rookie free agent on May 9, 2016. He was released on August 28, 2016. He signed with the Orlando Apollos in 2018 for the 2019 season. He was waived/injured before the start of the 2019 regular season and subsequently placed on injured reserve after clearing waivers. He was waived from injured reserve on March 26, 2019.

In January 1936 he was one of the leaders, gathered in Meerut, that were tasked with convening the founding conference of the All India Kisan Sabha in Lucknow. As a political activist, Rasul was an associate of Muzaffar Ahmed. Around 1943 Rasul was sent to Chittagong, to make contact with the Communist Party of Burma, but his trip was suspended due to a boat accident.

The company's software products provide farmers tools to manage their financial performance and manage agronomic inputs for maximum performance and return. In addition to digital tools for farmers, Granular also owns AgStudio, a precision ag software company used primarily by ag retailers and professional agronomists, as well as AcreValue, a website that uses proprietary algorithms to provide estimated land values. History Granular is a spinoff of the company Solum, which was founded in 2009. In 2014, Monsanto acquired half of the business, which focused on soil testing and was merged with Climate Corp. The remaining half of the company was spun-off into Granular. After the split, Granular raised $4.2 million in Series A round funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Google Ventures. In April 2015, Granular acquired the farmland valuation platform, AcreValue, for an undisclosed amount. In July 2015, the company raised an additional $18.7 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tao Capital, with additional funding from previous backers. The company opened a regional headquarters at the University of Illinois Research Park in Champaign, Illinois, in November 2015. In September 2017, Granular was acquired by DowDuPont, which became Corteva on June 6, 2019. CEO and Founder Sid Gorham was named director of digital solutions for Corteva and also maintains his title as Granular CEO. The company operates as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of Corteva, and maintains offices in Johnston, Iowa, and Cumming, Georgia, as well as their Illinois and San Francisco offices. Operations Granular Business software allows farmers to track the profitability of their farms. The platform tracks input and crop inventories, and integrates with data collected from a wide range of farming equipment. The company's smartphone application allows workers to access work orders, schedules and other information in the field. Through the 2015 acquisition of AcreValue, Granular allows users the ability to track and compare farmland values. The platform compiles public data sources and other factors, including soil, climate, geography and crop history to provide users with a custom land value report. In early 2019, AcreValue partnered with Land Brokers Institute to list new farmland listings on the site across all 48 contiguous U.S. states. As part of their agreement with DowDuPont, Granular assumed control of DowDuPont's digital agronomic software offering called Encirca, which provides farmers recommendations on variable rate seeding, fertility and nitrogen. Encirca field service agents also consult with growers throughout the growing season.

It has much higher water solubility than does estrone. Glucuronides are the most abundant estrogen conjugates and estrone glucuronide is the dominant metabolite of estradiol. When exogenous estradiol is administered orally, it is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (95%) in the intestines and liver. A single administered dose of estradiol is absorbed 15% as estrone, 25% as estrone sulfate, 25% as estradiol glucuronide, and 25% as estrone glucuronide. Formation of estrogen glucuronide conjugates is particularly important with oral estradiol as the percentage of estrogen glucuronide conjugates in circulation is much higher with oral ingestion than with parenteral estradiol. Estrone glucuronide can be reconverted back into estradiol, and a large circulating pool of estrogen glucuronide and sulfate conjugates serves as a long-lasting reservoir of estradiol that effectively extends its terminal half-life of oral estradiol. In demonstration of the importance of first-pass metabolism and the estrogen conjugate reservoir in the pharmacokinetics of estradiol, the terminal half- life of oral estradiol is 13 to 20 hours whereas with intravenous injection its terminal half-life is only about 1 to 2 hours.

It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Cheo Hodari Coker serving as showrunner. Mike Colter stars as Cage, alongside returning principal cast members Simone Missick, Theo Rossi, and Alfre Woodard. They are joined by Gabrielle Dennis and Mustafa Shakir, with Jessica Henwick, Finn Jones, and Stephen Rider reprising their roles from other Marvel/Netflix series; Rosario Dawson also returns in a guest role. The season was ordered in December 2016, and filmed in New York City from June to November 2017. Coker again emphasized music in the season: Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad returned to compose the original score, using blues and reggae to represent the conflict between the Stokes family and Shakir's Bushmaster; the season again features performances from various artists; and each episode is named after a Pete Rock & CL Smooth song. Reg E. Cathey has a recurring role as Cage's father in one of his last performances, and the season is dedicated to his memory. The season premiered on June 21, 2018, before all 13 episodes were released on Netflix on June 22. It was widely praised as better than the first season, particularly for its narrative and cast‚ÄîWoodard's performance especially‚Äîthough there was again some criticism for its pacing. Netflix canceled the series on October 19, 2018.

In July 2015, Sarandos said some of the Defenders series would \\"selectively have multiple seasons as they come out of the gate.\\" Regarding a second season, showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker stated he had \\"a few ideas\\", including possibly exploring the \\"Hero for Hire\\" aspect of Luke Cage, though noted he was not taking \\"any of this for granted\\" in terms of feeling a second season renewal from Netflix was guaranteed. Actor Mike Colter also felt \\"Heroes for Hire\\" could be explored in future seasons, as well as further exploring Cage's lifestyle change regarding his relationship with Jessica Jones and introducing the couple's daughter. In December 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, of 13 episodes. Coker compared the season to A Tribe Called Quest's second album The Low End Theory saying, their first album People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm \\"was great, but then Low End Theory was the record that everyone says ... when they think of A Tribe Called Quest taking it to the next level. That‚Äôs my hope for season 2, is that we have some of the similar sounds, but we go in a deeper direction.\\" Coker also noted that music would continue to be an important element for the season and that Harlem would still be \\"at the heart and its center\\" for the series. =Writing= In July 2017, Colter said the writing for the season was different from the first, because \\"we know the show now. We know the world that we‚Äôre in and we know sort of what works and what doesn‚Äôt work and we‚Äôre just gonna double down on that stuff, so look forward to a very exciting and very relevant and pop culture-heavy show.\\" He added that after the first season and the crossover miniseries The Defenders, Cage would have \\"a whole new outlook on life\\" and would not be dealing with the judicial system anymore. Coker explained that the storyline for the season did not come from any particular iteration of the comics, and instead was based on the characters that appear: \\"who is Luke Cage and getting much deeper into that, but also finding out different things about Mariah Dillard, also finding out things about Misty Knight,\\" including getting her mechanical arm \\"and what that entails from an emotional standpoint.\\" In particular, the new villains introduced for the season and their abilities impacted the story in terms of \\"what that represents against Luke\\". Each episode of the season is named after a Pete Rock & CL Smooth song, just as Coker named each episode of the first season after a Gang Starr song. =Casting= Colter returns to star as Cage, along with Simone Missick as Misty Knight, Rosario Dawson as Claire Temple, Alfre Woodard as Mariah Dillard, and Theo Rossi as Hernan \\"Shades\\" Alvarez. In July 2017, Marvel announced the casting of Mustafa Shakir as John McIver, and Gabrielle Dennis as Tilda Johnson. Thomas Q. Jones reprises his role as Comanche in the season, along with Danny Johnson as Benjamin Donovan, and Justin Swain as Mark Bailey. In October 2017, it was revealed that Finn Jones would be reprising his role as Danny Rand / Iron Fist in the season. Colter explained that there had been interest from fans to see more of the previously established relationship between Cage and Jessica Jones, but for this season they \\"went out on a limb\\" and decided to give to the fans of the \\"Heroes for Hire\\" instead by having Cage and Rand team up for part of the season. He added that Finn Jones \\"will bring some fresh blood in the new season\\". Jessica Henwick also reprises her Iron Fist role, appearing as Colleen Wing. Following the death of Reg E. Cathey in February 2018, Marvel revealed that his final performance was as Luke Cage's father James Lucas in this season. The character appeared briefly in the first season portrayed by an unnamed actor. In March 2018, Annabella Sciorra was announced to have been cast in the \\"key role\\" of Rosalie Carbone. The next month, Antonique Smith joined the cast as Detective Nandi Tyler, a longtime rival of Misty Knight. Additionally, Elden Henson reprises his role as Foggy Nelson from previous Marvel/Netflix series. The season also features cameo appearances by ESPN personalities Michael Smith, Jemele Hill, and Stephen A. Smith, and New York Jets head coach Todd Bowles, doubling as the head coach of the fictional Harlem Jets. As Coker is a sports fan, he decided to include the ESPN personalities and was partially motivated to reach out to Michael Smith and Hill out of \\"professional admiration\\". Coker noted the additional difficulty in getting the duo to appear because of Marvel's confidentiality requirements, meaning they could not see the scripts beforehand. Dialogue was written for the personalities, though each improvised some of it to make it sound like their own voice. Before reaching out to Bowles, Coker was going to ask David Shaw, head coach of the Stanford University Cardinal football team, since Shaw and Coker were college roommates, but the timing did not work out, as Shaw was recruiting students on the other side of the country. Coker then approached former Jets head coach Herm Edwards, since Edwards had one of Coker's \\"favorite coach meltdowns of all time\\", but Edwards also could not coordinate an appearance, resulting Coker approaching Bowles. Writer, author, and educator Jelani Cobb also cameos in the season, appearing as himself on a talk show speaking to Luke Cage's ability to fix Harlem. Cobb, who has \\"an ambivalent relationship\\" to the character of Luke Cage, \\"went back and forth\\" on whether he would appear in the season. He noted, \\"I really like the show and thought it‚Äôd be a fun thing to do, but I also think that sometimes it‚Äôs important for journalists to keep a separate line from what they‚Äôre actually doing versus the imaginary stuff that they‚Äôre doing, especially in the era of fake news.\\" Cobb discussed the potential appearances with \\"some of the people I respect in the field\\" for their opinion, and after gaining their approval, agreed to appear. =Filming= Principal photography began by June 10, 2017, under the series' working title Tiara. Production wrapped that November. =Music= In July 2017, Colter said that the second season would have \\"another feel to it\\" in terms of the music, praising the season's musical guests and explaining that he and Coker had chosen a \\"certain type\\" of music for the season after listening to it at a birthday party and agreeing that there had \\"not been one bad song\\" played. Coker later explained that the season would explore the roots of hip-hop with blues and reggae, after the first season introduced hip- hop to the MCU. He added that the season would explore \\"the entire diaspora of black music\\" along with different cultures. Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad again composed the score for the season, working out of Younge's studio Linear Labs. Their music for the season included a \\"50-minute epic\\" for one of the episodes. Coker described the pair as being as \\"important to the success of the show as anyone in the cast, anyone directing, anyone writing, producing, period.\\" Coker wanted to have live musical performances in the season again after the first, and hoped that some musicians who had turned him down for the first season would be happy to join the second after getting to see the series. He noted that the idea of performing in the series was not a \\"home run in terms of the music community\\" during the first season, and he had to call in a lot of favors from his time as a music journalist to get the performers who did appear. For the second season, he was able to show footage of the first season performances as well as point out where musicians who performed on the show received \\"immediate streaming bumps\\" from fans discovering them through the series. With Coker subsequently having his \\"choice of acts\\", the season includes live performance from Faith Evans, returning from the first season, along with Joi & D-Nice, Gary Clark Jr., Esperanza Spalding, Christone \\"Kingfish\\" Ingram, Ghostface Killah, Stephen Marley, Jadakiss, KRS-One, and Rakim. The latter wrote an original song for the series, which he performs in the season finale. The season also includes music from Nina Simone and Mobb Deep. =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= Following the death of Captain Ridenhour, high-ranking detective Brigid O'Reilly is mentioned as having recently moved to New Orleans, in reference to that character's role in the series Cloak & Dagger. Marketing An advanced screening of the season was hosted by Spotify, Netflix, and the Kennedy Center on June 19, followed by an after-party featuring musical performances by KRS- One, Younge and Muhammad, and surprise guests. The season had its red carpet premiere in New York City on June 21, 2018. Release The second season of Luke Cage was released on June 22, 2018, on the streaming service Netflix worldwide, in Ultra HD 4K and high dynamic range. Critical response The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 85% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.18/10 based on 62 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Marvel's Luke Cage surpasses the successes of its debut season with a satisfyingly complex narrative and a solid ensemble cast led by Alfre Woodard's standout performance as the archvillainess Black Mariah.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Awarding the \\"excellent\\" season four stars out of five, Olly Richards of Empire said, \\"Most of Marvel‚Äôs superhero series suffer a mid-season sag, without enough plot to fill their episode quota. This season never succumbs to that because it‚Äôs not rooted in plot but character. There are episodes where little happens in terms of event, but characters deepen and crack, becoming less who they want to be and more who they have to be, even Luke. Luke Cage could now remove any superhero elements almost entirely and still function as a series.\\" David Betancourt of The Washington Post felt the season was \\"spectacular, full of unforgettable performances, and has not one but two top-notch villains\\". Though he felt the season started slow, the later episodes are \\"where the magic happens\\". Alison Keene at Collider felt the \\"last few episodes are fantastic ‚Äî it just takes a lot to get there.\\" Keene also felt \\"There are plenty of things this season does well, really well, but there is so much filler and narrative dragging of feet in between that it‚Äôs hard to recommend it outright,\\" awarding the season three stars out of four. CNN's Brian Lowry was more critical of the season, feeling the season was \\"weaker\\" than the first, noting it was \\"not bad, overall, but still experiencing the equivalent of a sophomore slump.\\" Similar to Lowry, Alan Sepinwall at Rolling Stone gave the season two stars out of four, noting the 13-episode season had \\"only three or four episodes' worth of story at best\\".

Located on the Bloomington campus of Indiana University (IU), the Workshop was founded in 1950 at the height of the Cold War to provide intensive training in Russian and later other less commonly taught foreign languages. For the more than 65 years of its existence, the workshop has provided language training to over ten thousand students. It is widely known in the United States for its quality and variety, especially among university programs in Slavic, East European and Central Eurasian studies.  History  The first workshop was held from June 20 to July 25, 1951. It was called \\"Russian Workshop for graduate and undergraduate students\\" and was advertised as a \\"five-week course for men and women who desire a better understanding of the Russian language.\\" Sponsored by the IU Department of Slavic Studies and the IU Summer School, it was limited to 40 \\"qualified students.\\" The cost of tuition, board, and room in 1951 came to $185.\\"Russian Workshop for Graduate and Undergraduate Students, June 20 to July 25, 1951 on the Bloomington Campus of Indiana University\\" flyer, 1951.

The program was successful and soon grew to the point where yearly enrollments numbered about 200 students. In 1963 Polish and Serbo-Croatian languages were added and the program, now encompassing eight weeks of study, was renamed as the Slavic Workshop. Soon Czech language was added. The Slavic Workshop also featured language study tours to the Soviet Union, in which more than 100 students participated each summer. When the program underwent a significant expansion in the 1990s with the addition of several new languages, including non-Slavic languages, it was rechristened the Summer Workshop in Slavic and East European Languages (SWSEEL), a name that remained in place (despite the increasingly prominent role of Central Asian and other languages from outside of Eastern Europe) until 2013, when it received its current name of the Summer Language Workshop (though the abbreviation SWSEEL continues to be commonly used).  Languages  The language offerings in the Summer Language Workshop vary every summer. To date (through the summer of 2016), a total of 38 languages have been taught in Summer Language Workshop. Russian is the only language that has been taught every summer since the foundation of the program. The other languages are: Albanian, Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bulgarian, Chechen, Chinese, Czech, Dari, Estonian, Georgian, Hindi-Urdu, Hungarian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Kurdish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Mongolian, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbian/Croatian, Slovene, Slovak, Swahili, Tajik, Tatar, Tibetan, Turkish, Turkmen, Uighur, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Yiddish.

The contribution of Russian √©migr√©s to both the Summer Language Workshop and the IU Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures is recognized by a plaque, first proposed in 2002 by William Hopkins, a PhD alumnus of Indiana University, former Summer Language Workshop instructor, and translator for the US Department of State. The inscription on the plaque reads: \\"Dedicated in grateful memory to the emigre Russian language teachers of the Indiana University Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures and the Summer Workshop, who provided exceptional language training to generations of American students. Through their tireless efforts and willingness to share their love of the language and culture of Russia, these dedicated educators made an invaluable contribution to the lives and careers of countless students at Indiana University and to the enhancement of Slavic Studies in the United States\\". The following teachers are listed on the plaque: Borovkova, Anna Ivanovna; Cetverikova, Aleksandra Sergeevna; Fedulova, Margarita Petrovna; Kuleshova, Ekaterina Leonidovna; Lopato, Natalia Lvovna; McLaws, Galina Aleksandrovna; Malenko, Zinaida Nikolaevna; Martianov, Aleksandr Dmitrievich; Oussenko, Vera Grigorievna; Sednev, Moisej Ilarionovich; Selegen, Galina; Sklanchenko, Tatiana Yakovlevna; Slaviatinskaya, Lidia Prokofievna; Soudakova, Mariamna Iokimovna; Soudakoff, Stepan Petrovich; Ushakow, Wladimir Iosifovich; Zalucki, Maria Fedorovna; Zardetskaya, Elena Florianovna. Among the most notable Russian emigres who taught in the Summer Language Workshop in 1962 and 1963 is prominent Russian writer Nina Berberova. Of the hundreds of other instructors who either taught languages or delivered guest lectures at the Summer Language Workshop, some of the most well-known include Slavists Felix Oinas, Edward L.

By November 1190, Tancred had appointed Hugh captain and master justiciar of Apulia and the Terra di Lavoro (Capitaneus et Magister Iusticiarius Totius Apulie et Terre Laboris). Sometime later, Hugh's father died and he inherited the county of Catanzaro, as Hugh II. Following Tancred's death in 1194, Hugh supported the Emperor Henry VI's claim to Sicily. He witnessed several of Henry's documents in 1194‚Äì95. In 1197, while the German crusade was passing through Sicily, a revolt broke out. Hugh was implicated and his brother Jordan appears to have been the leader. The rebellion was soon crushed and Jordan executed. Hugh had a son, Henry, who was count of Conversano on 10 January 1197 and apparently on good terms with Henry VI.

Publication history In each series, the \\"Revolution\\" issue represented a jump of six months after the previous issue's events. In most cases, \\"Revolution\\" also marked an attempt to send each title in a new creative direction, and to this end new creative teams were assigned to the titles. Many characters' costumes were redesigned, and a \\"Revolution\\" logo was printed along the right-hand side of each issue. The most publicized of the changes was the return of writer Chris Claremont to the flagship titles X-Men vol. 2 and Uncanny X-Men, after nearly a decade's absence. The event also included nods to early-1990s marketing strategies such as printing variant coversX-Men vol. 2 #100 and including trading cards.Uncanny X-Men #381 The excitement of the event was dampened by Marvel Comics' timing, as most of the series involved had launched with all or part of their new creative teams a month before the event, even though the \\"Revolution\\" logo was still printed on the May issues, and Uncanny X-Men did not join the \\"Revolution\\" event until its June 2000 issue. Furthermore, Claremont stated in later interviews that he had ghostwritten several issues of various X-Men titles before the event. =Counter-X= Furthermore, three of the titles involved in the event, (X-Man, X-Force, and Generation X), were rebranded to Counter-X. Writer Warren Ellis plotted the general direction for each of the Counter-X books, and co- wrote each title with Steven Grant on X-Man, Ian Edginton on X-Force, and Brian Wood on Generation X. =Aftermath= The \\"Revolution\\" event was poorly received by fans and critics, leading to Claremont leaving X-Men and Uncanny X-Men after nine months. The X-Men line of books were revamped again in July 2001 with Grant Morrison writing New X-Men, Joe Casey writing Uncanny X-Men, and Claremont writing the new title X-Treme X-Men.

Jordan Lupin (; died 1197) was the first count of Bovino in the Norman kingdom of Sicily. He played a major role in the final years of Norman rule and first years of the Staufer dynasty. Twice he was involved in opposing crusader armies passing through Sicily. In the second instance, he led a revolt, apparently in the hope of seizing the throne. He was successful in attracting significant support, and was even crowned anti-king, but was ultimately captured and executed. Family and name Jordan was a son of Count Hugh I and Countess Clementia of the county of Catanzaro.Evelyn Jamison, \\"The Career of Judex Tarentinus magne curie magister justiciarius and the Emergence of the Sicilian regalis magna curia under William I and the Regency of Margaret of Navarra, 1156‚Äì1172\\", Proceedings of the British Academy, 53 (1967), pp. 289‚Äì344. He had an elder twin brother, Count Hugh of Conversano, who later inherited Catanzaro.G. A. Loud and Thomas E. J. Wiedemann (eds.), The History of the Tyrants of Sicily by ‚ÄòHugo Falcandus‚Äô, 1154‚Äì69 (Manchester University Press, 1998), p. 215, n. 72. For a genealogy of the counts of Catanzaro, see Table V on p. vi. Jordan's surname, Lupin (), was shared by his father and brother. It was mangled, however, by the English chronicler Roger of Hoveden into \\"Jordanus de Pino\\" or \\"Jordanus del Pin\\", whence the French historian Ferdinand Chalandon modernised it into \\"Jourdain du Pin\\". Two manuscripts of the Itinerarium Regis Ricardi of Richard de Templo, however, correctly render it Luppin, and the Norman poet Ambroise calls him \\"Jordanz Lupins\\" in the Norman dialect.Dione Rose Clementi, \\"The Circumstances of Count Tancred's Accession to the Kingdom of Sicily, Duchy of Apulia and the Principality of Capua\\", M√©langes Antonio Marongiu (Palermo: 1967), pp. 57‚Äì80, at 68‚Äì69.For the name variants, see Kate Norgate, \\"The ‚ÄòItinerarium Peregrinorum‚Äô and the ‚ÄòSong of Ambrose‚Äô\\", The English Historical Review, 25:99 (1910), pp. 523‚Äì47, at 528, and Fran√ßoise Vielliard, \\"Richard C≈ìur de Lion et son entourage normand: le t√©moignage de l‚ÄôEstoire de la guerre sainte\\", Biblioth√®que de l'√âcole des chartes, 160:1 (2002), pp. 5‚Äì52, at 25. Governor of Bovino and Messina The Norman castle at Bovino, the centre of Jordan's county in mainland southern Italy. In Palermo in May 1183, Jordan witnessed the royal diploma permitting the marriage of Roger of Tarsia and Maria, daughter of Robert Malconvenant.Jeremy Johns, Arabic Administration in Norman Sicily: The Royal Diwan (Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 321. By the later 1180s, he was a member of the royal bodyguard. In March 1187, he was the royal seneschal (regis senescalcus) under William II. He was also the lord of Tavis, that is, the region around Mount Altesina in the Heraean Mountains of central Sicily.Errico Cuozzo, \\"I conti normanni di Catanzaro\\", Miscellanea di studi storici (Calabria), 2 (1982): 109‚Äì27, at 118‚Äì20. In the succession dispute that followed William's death in 1189, he supported Tancred, who rewarded him with the county of Bovino. This county was a new creation, having been carved out of the south of the county of Loritello.Dione Rose Clementi, \\"Calendar of Diplomas of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Henry VI Concerning the Kingdom of Sicily\\", Quellen und Forschungen aus italienischen Archiven und Bibliotheken, 35 (1955), pp. 86‚Äì225, at 136. It also included Deliceto, Montellere and Monterisi. The historian Errico Cuozzo suggests that Jordan was only granted the county of Bovino as compensation for the loss of Messina. By the autumn of 1190, Tancred had entrusted the defence of Messina to Jordan, and he was in charge when two large armies of the Third Crusade under Philip II of France and Richard I of England arrived. According to Roger of Hoveden, while Jordan and some other Sicilian leaders were meeting with Richard in the latter's lodgings on 4 October 1190, a riot broke out and the Anglo-Norman crusaders were attacked. In response, Richard stormed the city. According to both Roger of Hoveden and Ambroise, Jordan and the Sicilian admiral Margaritus had stirred up the city against the crusaders and provoked the riots. In the end, Jordan was forced to leave Messina to Richard, who was in turn forced by Philip to place it under the nominal control of the Templars and Hospitallers until Tancred paid an indemnity.John Gillingham, Richard I (Yale University Press, 1999), p. 134 and n. 41.Ferdinand Chalandon, Histoire de la domination normande en Italie et en Sicile, vol. 2 (Paris: A. Picard, 1907), pp. 438‚Äì39. According to Ralph of Diceto, Jordan and Margaritus fled the city in secret with their families.Ralph of Diceto; William Stubbs, ed., Radulfi de Diceto Decani Lundoniensis Opera Historica: The Historical Works of Master Ralph de Diceto, Dean of London (London: 1876), p. 86. All the Anglo-Norman writers who deal with Jordan‚ÄîRoger of Hoveden, Richard de Templo and Ambroise‚Äîwere writing after Tancred's death, and after Jordan had switched his support to the emperor. They universally have a negative opinion of him.Evelyn Jamison, \\"The Sicilian Norman Kingdom in the Mind of Anglo-Norman Contemporaries\\", in Dione Rose Clementi and Theo K√∂lzer (eds.), Studies on the History of Medieval Sicily and South Italy (Scientia Verlag, 1992), pp. 159‚Äì208, at 185. They also call him a familiaris, the highest court rank, although there is no evidence Jordan held this rank.Evelyn Jamison, Admiral Eugenius of Sicily, His Life and Work and the Authorship of the Epistola ad Petrum and the Historia Hugonis Falcandi Siculi (London: 1957), p. 94, n. 3. Rebellion and execution The castle of Castrogiovanni was the final stronghold of Jordan's rebellion in 1197. After Tancred's death in 1194, the Emperor Henry VI took over Sicily in the name of his wife, Constance, daughter of Roger II. Despite having supported Tancred's claim over Constance's, Jordan and his brother supported Henry after Tancred's death and both appear to have gained Henry's trust, for they confirmed many of the emperor's Sicilian grants and privileges. Cuozzo argues that Jordan and his brother abandoned Tancred for Henry as early as the summer of 1192. In May 1197, as Henry passed through Sicily on his way to join the German crusade, a revolt broke out. Jordan and his brother were both implicated. According to the Annales Stadenses, erroneously under the year 1196, the leader of the revolt was one \\"Jordanus de Sicilia\\". The historian Evelyn Jamison first proposed that this was Jordan Lupin, a proposal which has been widely accepted.Ulrike Kessler, Richard I. L√∂wenherz: K√∂nig, Kreuzritter, Abenteurer (Verlag Styria, 1995), p. 418, n. 222. Nevertheless, the chronicler Richard of San Germano names the castellan of Castrogiovanni as a certain William the Monk (Guilielmus monachus), and it has been argued that he was the rebel leader later executed by Henry.Georg Pertz (ed.), Ryccardi de sancto Germano notarii chronica (Hanover: Hahn, 1864), pp. 17‚Äì18.For a list of sources that have dealt with the rebellion of 1197 and its leader's fate, see Huub Kurstjens (unpub.), \\"Nijmegen and Enna: Henry VI, Frederick II and the Coat of Arms (ca. 1150‚Äì1250)\\", p. 2, n. 10. Henry crushed the rebellion mercilessly, inflicting terrible vengeance on captured rebels. Jordan was a pretender to the throne at this stage, having even been crowned and having received a gift of jewels from Queen Constance, who had thrown her support to the rebels against her own husband.Jamison, Admiral Eugenius, pp. 158‚Äì59. He was holed up in the castle of Castrogiovanni.Thomas Curtis Van Cleve, The Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen: Immutator Mundi (Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 24. He surrendered to Henry and was tortured and executed in June 1197 in front of the queen. According to Otto of Sankt Blasien, the emperor \\"ordered that a man who aspired to the royal crown [i.e. Jordan] should have a crown fixed to him by iron nails\\".G. A. Loud (ed.), The Crusade of Frederick Barbarossa: The History of the Expedition of the Emperor Frederick and Related Texts (Ashgate, 2010), pp. 173‚Äì92, at ¬ß39 and n. 50. Others indicate that he was forced to sit on a red-hot throne and that the crown nailed to his head was heated until glowing.Edgar Prestage, Chivalry: Its Historical Significance and Civilizing Influence (Routledge, 2000 [1928]), p. 86. Following the crushing of the revolt, the county of Bovino was dissolved. Conversano and Catanzaro were confiscated from Hugh, who is never heard of again, and bestowed on Berardo Gentile and Riccardo di Fallucca, respectively. In 1201, the house formerly belonging to Jordan in Messina was granted to Anfusus de Rota.

A shrine to the five kings in the Anping Tianhou Temple in Tainan. A shrine to the five kings in the Grand Matsu Temple in Tainan. The Shuixian Zunwang are five Taoist immortals worshipped as water and sea gods. They have various names in English including the Honorable Water Immortal Kings and the Gods of the Waters. Their worship seems to derive from a misunderstanding of one of Wu Zixu's religious titles. They are believed to protect vessels in transit. Names The Chinese title Shu«êxiƒÅn Z≈´nw√°ng is variously translated into English as the the Illustrious, Revered, or Eminent ,. the . the . & the . and the The head of the five is Yu the Great, the legendary first emperor of the Xia Dynasty in prehistoric China. Within China, the Xia are now generally associated with the historical Erlitou culture along the Wei and middle Yellow Rivers, while foreign scholarship often continues to dismiss it as legendary. Yu became regarded as a water deity through his involvement with controlling the Great Flood of Chinese myth, which may have preserved aspects of the Yellow River's massive flooding . As Chinese generally fails to distinguish between singular and plural nouns, z≈´nw√°ng is sometimes considered to refer to a single Illustrious King. In such cases, it is usually identified with Yu alone. The existence of a quintet of gods, however, is thought to derive from a misunderstanding of Wu Zixu's surname (pW«î) as intending its usual sense as a synonym for the Chinese word for \\"five\\" (, pw«î) in its appearance in his divine title \\"King Wu\\" (, pW«îw√°ng). Wu Zixu was a Chu noble who was forced into exile in Wu. There, he helped the prince Ji Guang assassinate the king and enthrone himself as King Hel√º. He then played a role in Wu's invasion of his homeland, exhuming the corpse of its former king to punish it for the earlier death of his father and brother. He accurately predicted that Yue would endanger Wu but did not have the ear of Hel√º's successor Fuchai. He was forced to commit suicide; his body placed in a leather bag and then thrown into a river. After the fall of Wu, Wu Zixu's spirit was worshipped as Taoshen, \\"God of the Waves\\",. & and particularly as the god of the Qiantang Tidal Bore at Hangzhou.. Wu Zixu had also been involved with the urban planning of King Hel√º's capital at Suzhou and is sometimes considered a culture hero credited with inventing the waterwheel. Xiang Yu, the \\"warlord of western Chu\\" whose revolt ended the Qin Empire in 206, was killed fighting the forces of Han beside the Wu River in Anhui in 202. He is usually said to have slit his throat and had his body torn to pieces by his enemies, but he became regarded as a water deity from a separate legend that his body miraculously remained standing in the waters of the Wu after his suicide. Qu Yuan was a poet and advisor to his relative the king of Chu. He was exiled upon supposedly slanderous reports of his fellow courtiers and committed suicide by walking into the Miluo while holding a rock, out of frustration with either his exile. or with the direction of Chu's public policy.. His memory is honored at Duanwu by various the traditions of the Dragon Boat Festival, although some believe this to have been a misplaced bit of Wu Zixu's legacy. The fifth figure variously appears as \\"King\\"Ao √Äow√°ng) or as the inventor Lu Ban.. & The \\"King\\" Ao‚Äîliterally the \\"Arrogant King\\"‚Äîis the deified form of Ao (, √Äo) or Jiao (, JiƒÅo),. the preternaturally strong son of Han Zhuo, the advisor who usurped the realm of the archer Houyi in the 8th year of the reign of the Xia king Xiang.Bamboo Annals. Ao is said to have conquered the state of Ge for his father during the same year. He became regarded as a water deity through his supposed role as the inventor of ships, which he was said to be able to sail across land as well as water. He was killed by Xiang's son . Lu Ban, also known by his Cantonese name Lo Pan, was a woodworker at the end of the Spring and Autumn Period who became revered as the Chinese god of carpentry and masonry. The great demand for his work during his life supposedly compelled him to invent or improve a number of carpenter's tools‚Äîthe saw, the square, the planer, the drill, the shovel, and an ink marking tool‚Äîto complete his many projects more quickly.. A temple of the water immortals in Wuxi on the mainland, preserved as a museum. History The worship of the Shuixian Zunwang as a quintet of kings appears to derive from a misunderstanding of one of Wu Zixu's religious titles. (Chinese generally lacks plural noun forms and his surname is a variant of the Chinese word for \\"five\\".) The honorable kings of the water immortals were first worshipped around Xiamen, which became a stronghold for Ming loyalists during the Qing conquest of China. Under Koxinga, the Zheng dynasty defeated the Dutch on Taiwan and moved from a base at Xiamen to the area around Tainan, which they ruled as the Kingdom of Tungning. They appear to have been responsible for the introduction of the worship of Fujian's five kings there. Worship Xingang on Taiwan The Shuixian Zunwang are worshipped as protectors of ships in transit. A shrine in their honor was included on most Taiwanese vessels during the imperial era; even today, most Taiwanese harbors include temples to them. Their shrines also appear in Mazuist temples.

The two carriageways are apart from each other, and gain their namesake from the roads that they lead into once reaching the downtown Federal Triangle neighborhood. Both expressways travel underneath the National Mall via the 9th Street Tunnel and the 12th Street Tunnel, which are often seen as alternatives to the nearby 3rd Street Tunnel of I-395. Route description The 9th Street Expressway carriageway begins at an intersection with Maine Avenue SW in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood of the city. This intersection also connects to G Street SW and L'Enfant Promenade. Just north of here, the 9th Street Expressway crosses over I-395 (Southwest Freeway). At this interchange, the 12th Street Expressway begins, feeding traffic off of a ramp that extends onto the Francis Case Memorial Bridge. Northbound I-395 has a direct connection to 12th Street via exit 3, but I-395 south must use exit 4, which also serves Maine Avenue. The 12th Street Expressway has an exit to D Street SW, also serving L'Enfant Promenade and buildings of the General Services Administration. The segment of the 9th Street Expressway between I-395 and D Street in fact tunnels underneath a building on L'Enfant Plaza that houses the National Transportation Safety Board. Both roads receive on-ramps leading from Independence Avenue, just south of the twin tunnels that travel underneath the National Mall. Now in Federal Triangle of the Northwest quadrant, both roads terminate at an intersection with Constitution Avenue NW, while both rights- of-way continue northbound via 9th and 12th Streets NW. Although signage is rare and quite small, Constitution Avenue at this intersection carries the designation of both U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and US 50. History The 9th and 12th Street Expressways opened in conjunction with the Southwest Freeway in the late 1960s. The spur routes originally terminated with I-95, before freeway revolts canceled other projects in the district that resulted in a route designation change.

Ambassador to Poland Likambe became Zaire's ambassador to Poland in 1992, at a time when Zaire's economy was struggling and there was little funding available for diplomats. By early 1994, Likambe's funds had run out and he was ejected from his flat. The Embassy of Zaire stopped paying rent, and Likambe ran up bills at local hotels, which he failed to pay. After selling his car and personal belongings to keep the embassy running, Likambe eventually became homeless and lived at the Warsaw railway station. The Polish authorities did not discover his situation until November 1994, after he was attacked by other homeless people who stole his glasses. Afterwards the Polish government rented him an apartment.

United States Atomic Energy Commission, 449 F.2d 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1971), is a court case which provided the first important court interpretation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Background  In 1966, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company purchased property in Calvert County, Maryland along Chesapeake Bay. They bought the property with the intention of building a nuclear power plant along the shoreline and applied for a nuclear power plant license. The utility began construction on the plant in 1968. Concerned about the impacts to the Chesapeake Bay's blue crab population, scientists from Johns Hopkins University analyzed the plant's potential impacts on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The scientists' apprehension about the potential adverse impacts of the plant's radioactive emissions as well as the discharge of heated cooling water into the Chesapeake Bay lead to the formation of the Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee. The Committee challenged in court the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's decision to license the power plant.  The issue  After the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in 1970, the Atomic Energy Commission revised its licensing rules to comply with the new Act. The newly revised rules stated that while a utility company must provide an environmental report for each proposed plant, the Atomic Energy Commission's hearing board did not have a mandate to consider the environmental impacts of each new plant unless a challenge was issued to a specific plant. Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee argued that the Atomic Energy Commission's rules were inadequate and a direct violation of NEPA's Environmental Impact Statement requirement  Decision  Judge J Skelly Wright and the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the Atomic Energy Commission is required to consider the environmental impacts of licensing a nuclear power plant, regardless of whether a challenge was raised or not. The D.C. Circuit Court took the ruling a step further and made NEPA judicially enforceable by establishing procedural and substantive provisions for how federal agencies should comply with NEPA. Judge Wright and the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the Atomic Energy Commission's rules were deficient and required revision. =Holdings= The court made several key decisions regarding how federal agencies comply with NEPA: :# The general substantive policy in Section 101 of NEPA is flexible. :# The procedural provisions in Section 102 of NEPA are not as flexible and were created to ensure that federal agencies comply with the substantive discretion they have been granted. :# Every federal agency and department is required to consider environmental protection and \\"to take environmental values into account\\". :# How agencies balance environmental issues with other agency priorities should be disclosed in a detailed statement in accordance with NEPA Section 102. :# Federal agencies must carry out NEPA's procedural duties \\"to the fullest extent possible\\". :# Federal agencies must conduct a careful and informed decision-making process in accordance with Section 102 of NEPA. Section 102 of NEPA also creates judicially enforceable duties. :# Federal agencies must take into account the findings of the environmental reports in their decision-making processes. :# The federal agency with the responsibility for a project or action is the only appropriate entity to balance environmental costs with economic and technical benefits. :# NEPA requires federal agencies to consider alternatives that would reduce environmental damage. :# Postponing the operation of a facility does not qualify as a reasonable explanation for eliminating the consideration of environmental issues under NEPA.  Results of the decision  As a result of the decision, the Atomic Energy Commission halted the licensing of all nuclear plants for eighteen months in order to modify its licensing rules to comply with NEPA. Baltimore Gas and Electric decided to pursue the operation of the Calvert Cliffs plant and released an Environmental Impact Statement. The final environmental report determined that the proposed operation of the nuclear plant would have no major adverse effect to the environment. The Atomic Energy Commission granted Baltimore Gas and Electric an operating license for its first reactor in 1974 and the plant began producing energy in 1975.

The supposed rationale for the MGR was the view that U.S. soldiers had a very difficult time determining which Vietnamese people were civilians and which were enemies. To the extent that soldiers believed the MGR existed, it effectively gave them permission to err on the side of killing suspected Vietnamese enemies even if there was a very good chance that they were civilians. Some authors have argued that the MGR helped create a climate in which the United States committed many war crimes in Vietnam. The very existence of the MGR is controversial. Some authors deny that case evidence from courts-martial in Vietnam support the existence of any MGR. Others argue that it created a racist climate in which women could be raped and even children could be killed as long as they were \\"mere gooks\\". For example, Nick Turse argues that policies like the MGR allowed Sergeant Roy E. Bumgarner, known as \\"the bummer\\", to amass a body count of over 1,500 Vietnamese (many of them civilians) over his seven years in Vietnam. In 1969, Bumgarner was apparently convicted of the premeditated killing of four Vietnamese civilians and covering it up after the fact, but he was given only a six month-loss in pay and was later reinstated for another tour of duty.

This intermediate five miles has been described by Johnstone as \\"a low, uninterrupted, barren sand as far as the eye could reach.\\" It is an extensive flat of bluish yellow mud, covered with water during stormy days at flood tide; but at low tide no water is present.

(Under the Shang, the Chinese week was divided into ten days, each honoring particular royal ancestors and each regarded as having a separate sun shining in turn.)

She has exhibited work in Canada, the United States of America, and Europe. MacLeod received an award from La Fondation Andr√© Piolat (1995), and a VIVA award from the Doris and Jack Shadbolt Foundation (1999). She has work in public, and private collections, including at the National Art Gallery of Canada, and the Vancouver Art Gallery. Early life MacLeod grew up between Oakville, Ontario, and London, Ontario. Upon completing high school, she traveled throughout Europe. Coming back to Canada, MacLeod attended Concordia University, in Montreal, Quebec, where she studied film before changing her major to visual arts. MacLeod uses humor, satire, allusions to pop culture, and often references various folklore traditions in her work. She takes interest in how an image or object can be transformed to change its meaning. Since the 1990s, MacLeod has become known for creating art that extends across, and links together, high culture with mass entertainment. In recent work, MacLeod directs focus towards how popular culture has portrayed masculinity through the lens of modernist art history. Artistic mediums that MacLeod works in are sculpture, drawing, painting, and photography, performance video, and sound installation. MacLeod has also written works, including published essays, and an artist book titled ‚ÄúWhole Lotta Love‚Äù (2012). MacLeod is represented by the Catriona Jeffries Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia. Education MacLeod attended Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990. In 1994, MacLeod completed an independent study at √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. MacLeod completed her Master of Fine Arts at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1995. Teaching appointments MacLeod has taught in Vancouver, at the University of British Columbia in 1995, Emily Carr University of Art and Design from 2001 to 2006, as well as teaching as an assistant professor at the University of Western Ontario, in London, Ontario, from 2007 to 2008. Group exhibitions =Bounce (2002)= MacLeod was part of Bounce, an exhibition showcasing three Vancouver-based emerging artists, held at the Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery in Toronto, Ontario. Curated by Philip Monk, Bounce included works by Myfanwy MacLeod, Brian Jungen, and Damian Moppett. Bounce was an exhibition primarily based on sculpture, and included sketches and drawings. Works by MacLeod included in Bounce were: The Tiny Kingdom (2001), Wood For The People, (2002), and A Shady Place (2002). Placed with one another, these works reference to the ‚Äòhillbilly‚Äô portrayed through pop culture. =Hammertown (2002-2004)= Hammertown was a touring exhibition curated by Reid Shier and co-presented by the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh, Scotland (2002), Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver (2002), and the Winnipeg Art Gallery, Manitoba (2004). MacLeod's work was presented alongside Geoffrey Farmer, Brian Jungen, Euan Macdonald, Luane Martineau, Damian Moppett, Shannon Oksanen, and Kevin Schmidt. MacLeod's use of enormous scale, weight, and minimalism is conveyed through the inclusion of Our Mutual Friend (2002), a wooden carved sculpture that measures nineteen inches long, and has a circumference of ten inches. Our Mutual Friend refers to a Charles Dicken's novel, and is a visual example of MacLeod's interest with satire, and disembodied parts. Work in Scotland In the spring of 2005, MacLeod was part of the three-month-longSamotie, Bill and Pamela Groberman. \\"Savant Communications Inc.- First Canadian Artist-In-Residence At Scotland's Glenfiddich Distillery Exhibits Results At Vancouver's Contemporary Art Gallery.\\" Letter. 16 Jan. 2006. MS. Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia. Glenfiddich Distilleries artist-in-residence program. During the residency, MacLeod documented her experience through photography, sculpture, and drawing. She recorded specific aspects of the area surrounding the distilleries, and notably- the deterioration of buildings on the land that Glenfiddich Distilleries inhabits. MacLeod was the first Canadian artist to be invited to this residency, and was one of seven international artists attending the residency. The collection of work created through the Glenfiddich Distilleries artist in residence program was shown at the Contemporary Art Gallery in 2006, in an exhibition titled Where I Have Lived and What I Have Lived For. Solo exhibitions =Myfanwy MacLeod: A Brief Overview of Personology (2000)= MacLeod's exhibition, A Brief Overview of Personology, was created for the Charles H. Scott Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was curated by Cate Rimmer A Brief Overview of Personology contained several works by MacLeod that were under the themes surrounding the use of self-help books, consumerism, and comedy, creating a dynamic setting of satire. MacLeod pulls inspiration from Tracy Cabot's How To Make a Man Fall in Love With You, a self-help book and appropriates illustrations from the book, putting them into the realm of fine art for public viewing. Works by MacLeod include four silkscreen prints titled How To Make a Man Fall in Love With You (2000), a wood sculpture called One Week (2000), twelve ink drawings on vellum paper based on film stills (2000), and The Greeter (2000), a video projection where MacLeod poses as a greeter that can be found in big box department stores. =The Tiny Kingdom (2001)= The Tiny Kingdom (2000) is a wood and mixed media based sculpture, measuring fourteen feet high, four feet long, and four feet wide. The Tiny Kingdom is a full-size scale of an outhouse, inspired by the one used in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang(1968). It was first shown in 2001 at the Or Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Tiny Kingdom is ‚Äúintended to function as a place of reflection and solitude‚Äù, and ‚Äúforegrounds the anxious relations between art and society, country and city, colony and imperialist nation‚Äù. MacLeod alludes to the idea of Marcel Dumchamp's 'Ready Made,' and combines it with references to pop culture, and folklore. The Tiny Kingdom is now in the permanent collection at the National Art Gallery of Canada. =Where I Lived and What I Lived For (2006)= The work that MacLeod created at Glenfiddich Distilleries was presented in 2006 at the Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia. With the inclusion of photography, this exhibition featured work of MacLeod's that stood out from her previous pieces, as photography is not a medium MacLeod used often in her practice before this residency. Works included in Where I Lived and What I Lived For range from large-scale photographs, drawings, to sculpture, and installations. This exhibition showcases the influence Scotland had on her. MacLeod has described her experience as a ‚Äúvoyage of discovery‚Äù,Groberman, Pamela. \\"Famous Scottish Distillery Sponsors Exhibition By Vancouver Artist.\\" Letter. 16 Jan. 2006. MS. Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia. and said that ‚ÄúScotland offered [her] the chance to approach [her] work in a different way‚Äù. =Myfanwy MacLeod, or There and Back Again (2013-2014)= Myfanwy MacLeod, or There And Back Again is a retrospective art exhibition that includes work by MacLeod made within the previous decade. It explores 1970s pop-culture, both in real and imagined ways, following a theme that references minimalism. The name of the exhibition alludes to JRR Tolkien's literary piece The Hobbit, and 1970s cultural references, including Led Zeppelin. Myfanwy MacLeod, or There and Back Again also hints at the idea of the Bildungsroman. Myfanwy MacLeod, or There And Back Again took place in two separate sites- in 2013, it was exhibited at Museum London, Ontario. In 2014, the exhibit was shown at the Vancouver Art Gallery, in British Columbia. The exhibition was curated by Cassandra Getty, curator for the Museum London, and Grant Arnold, Audain curator for British Columbia Art at The Vancouver Art Gallery. Having been born in London, Ontario in 1961, MacLeod spent her ‚Äúformative years‚Äù immersed in the ‚Äúcool-culture‚Äù of rock and roll, muscle cars, and feathered hair. Myfanwy MacLeod, or There And Back Again showcases the nostalgia that MacLeod has for the past. Hosting the exhibition in two specific locations, MacLeod bridges the gap between then and now by exhibiting the work in both her childhood hometown of London Ontario, and in Vancouver, British Columbia, the current city where she resides. The show contains a collection of work that MacLeod had made over ten years preceding Myfanwy MacLeod, or There And Back Again, and includes rock band and movie posters, soft porn magazines, snap shot photographs, origami, folk crafts, and children's crafts. At the exhibition held at the Vancouver Art Gallery, MacLeod adopted the role of the curator, alongside Grant Arnold, and curated Artist‚Äôs Choice Cock and Bull (2014). This component of the exhibition was based on hybridity, combining the works by MacLeod exhibited at Museum London with chosen pieces from the Vancouver Art Gallery's permanent collection, following the theme of a \\"Cock and Bull story\\". By only including work created by men in Artist‚Äôs Choice Cock and Bull, MacLeod surmises how different means of displaying artwork can draw attention to the ambiguity of working as a feminist within the realm of contemporary art. In Artist‚Äôs Choice Cock and Bull, the exhibition was reorganized from the traditional layout presented at Museum London, to one that plays even more on the idea of ‚ÄúSex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll‚Äù. The exhibition held in Vancouver British Columbia contained three additional pieces by MacLeod that were not shown in London, Ontario. These pieces were Albert Walker (2014), Dragon (2014), and Presence (2013). Presence, a small sculpture placed on a dolly referencing an album by Led Zeppelin, creates a link between heavy metal music of the 1970s, and minimalism. Dragon, is a photomural on paper paralleling MacLeod's Albert Walker, which is a sculptural installation piece that takes form as an entertainment center- furniture that one could find housing a television in a middle-class home. This entertainment center holds twelve enlarged buds of marijuana, which were duplicated through three-dimensional print and cast in nylon. The buds used in Albert Walker were painted using chameleon paint, a paint that, once applied, changes colour depending on the direction and lighting one is looking at the object in. Through the use of three dimensional printing technologies, MacLeod alludes to the fact that the rarely found strain of marijuana known as ‚ÄòAlbert Walker‚Äô can only be ‚Äúreproduced through cloning‚Äù. Albert Walker is also the name of a Canadian-born man that committed major fraud, and murder. MacLeod has included references to music, particularly the heavy metal genre of the 1970s, showcasing her connection to and nostalgia of the genre. MacLeod alludes to the band Led Zeppelin in some of her work, including Whole Lotta Love, an artist publication created in 2012. Stack, 2013, is an installation of screen prints on canvas that resembles a stack of three by six ‚Äúlarger than life‚Äù Marshall speakers. Some pieces within Myfanwy MacLeod, or There And Back Again are named after Led Zeppelin songs, including Ramble On, 2013- a 1977 Camaro Rally Sport presented on a steel stand and a sculpture made up of a mannequin, Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and beer cans titled Living, Loving Maid (She‚Äôs Just a Woman) (2013). Through the art of origami, MacLeod adds geometry to images of women found in playboy magazines. MacLeod uses the center-folds of the magazines, and contorts the image by folding it directly, playing on the humour in the taboo within the forms. MacLeod touched on a more serious topic by including images of British Columbia born Dorothy Stratten, an actress and playboy model from the 1970s with a shocking and grim story. The geometry in the origami forms is reflected throughout the exhibition, in pieces such like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Dreaming‚Äù, 2004, made up of two three dimensional geometric shaped speakers, compact discs, carpet, and a wallpaper mural, bridging rock and roll with the origami presented. Don‚Äôt Stop Dreaming also reflects on previous work relating to the theme of self-help books. Macleod has explored topics of folklore traditions in Hex series (2009). Exhibited at the Catriona Jeffries gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia in 2009, and in Myfanwy MacLeod, or There And Back Again in 2013 and 2014, Hex Series is a collection of hand painted signs based on patterns found in Dutch culture in Eastern Pennsylvania. Hex Series contains symbols that have distinct meanings. The series is inspired by traditional Hex signs, and are commonly found on barn doors. By recreating these symbols, and placing them in the unusual setting of an art exhibition, MacLeod creates a parallel meaning by showcasing them through a conceptual standpoint. Commissioned pieces =The Birds (2010)= The Birds was MacLeod's first major public art commission, and is situated in Vancouver British Columbia. Partially inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963), The Birds is a large sculpture of two house sparrows, birds that are not indigenous to British Columbia. This sculpture challenges the idea of place and impossibility. =Playtime (2016)= Playtime is a site specific public art piece situated in Vancouver at the British Columbia (BC) Women's and Children's Hospital. Created by MacLeod, and Vancouver-based artist Shannon Oksanen, this piece was commissioned by the BC Children's and BC Women's Redevelopment Project. Using the idea of playground design as a starting point, MacLeod and Oksanen created five ‚Äúmodernist play‚Äù sculptures that are painted black and white, and are made out of glass fibre, and concrete. The individual names of each piece are: Two Figures in Oribit, The Family Man, Dryad, The Magic Stones, and The Musician. Grouped together, they are collectively titled Playtime. Playtime is an interactive art piece integrated into the Wellness Walkway of the BC Women's and Children's hospital.

Inception The group of students from South City International School at the Christmas Parade on Park Street during the Kolkata Christmas Festival (KCF) in 2016 The Kolkata Christmas Festival (KCF) was started in 2011 by the Tourism Department of the Government of West Bengal, in association with the Christian community. It was conceptualised by Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal. This festival is a result of the combined efforts of the West Bengal Government, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Kolkata Police, and a few private organisations. The festival Christmas Parade by students at the 2016 Kolkata Christmas Festival Kolkata Christmas Festival is held in December (from December 22 to December 30 in 2017). It initially spanned just the period around Christmas Day but has since been extended. The festival is hosted at Allen Park on Park Street (renamed Mother Teresa Sarani). Park Street is turned into a walk-only zone during Christmas and New Year‚Äôs eves. Allen Park is the nucleus of the carnival where the live music performances take place. The choir of Dr Graham's Homes School from Kalimpong, Calcutta Symphony Orchestra from the Calcutta School of Music and choirs have performed at the KCF. Usha Uthup, Barefoot, Krosswindz, Orient Express have performed live at KCF over the years. A large Christmas tree is placed near Mother Teresa‚Äôs statue at the Park Street-Camac Street crossing. Park Street is converted to a 'Walk-Only' road on the Christmas eve, Christmas day, New Year's eve and on New Year's Day to allow the revelers to walk freely and meet a& greet with each other.

It is a small, openly branched, sticky shrub with mauve and white, bugle-shaped flowers. Description Dasymalla teckiana is an openly branched shrub which grows to a height of and which is sticky due to the glandular hairs which cover its branches. Its leaves are stalkless, have their base partly wrapped around the stem, oval to egg-shaped, long and wide. They are sticky, glabrous and green with a few blunt teeth along their edges near the ends. The flowers are white and mauve, purple, lilac or violet and are usually arranged singly in upper leaf axils on a stalk long and covered with glandular hairs. The flowers are surrounded by green, leafy, oblong bracts, long and green, hairy, glandular bracteoles long. The five sepals are long and sticky with linear lobes and joined to form a short tube near their bases. The five petals are joined to form a tube long with a few hairs on the outside and glabrous inside except for a densely hairy ring around the ovary. There are five lobes on the end of the petal tube, the lower one elliptic to almost round and slightly larger than the other four lobes. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1889 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Chloanthes teckiana and published the description in the Victorian Naturalist. The type specimen was collected by John Forrest. In 1904, Georg August Pritzel changed the name to Pityrodia teckiana and in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber changed it to Dasymalla teckiana. The specific epithet (teckiana) honours Francis, Duke of Teck. Distribution Dasymalla teckiana occurs in the south-west of Western Australia, mostly north of the Great Eastern Highway, as far east as Kalgoorlie in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Dampierland and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions growing in a range of soils near granite outcrops.

It originated as the Forum against Rape in 1980, organising protests in the city to the judgement in the Mathura rape case.  Origins  A protest letter against the Mathura rape case judgement in 1979 sparked a new debate about Indian laws about rape. In Mumbai, forty women who saw this letter organised a public meeting on 23 February 1980, to protest the judgement. The group referred to itself as the Forum against Rape. Acknowledging the much broader scope of concerns it wished to address, the group renamed itself Forum against Oppression of Women (FAOW).  Purpose  The group has gone on to serve as \\"an umbrella group for a cultural group, a group working with trade unions, and a space for interactions with women on a daily basis--the Women's Centre\\".  Activities  Since the 1980s, FAOW has taken on advocacy relating to a range of women's rights issues. A few examples follow. = Rape = Activism around the Mathura judgement prompted the founding of the Forum against Rape, which organised a public meeting and rally to protest the judgement. FAOW took up other cases of rape over the years, including the Turbhe case. = Sex- selective abortion = FAOW was an active part of the Forum Against Sex Determination and Sex Preselection (FASDAP). Activism in the mid-1980s around sex-selective abortion had two objectives: to get a law passed on sex determination tests and to create awareness around the issue. \\"Right from the start, it became evident that since the large majority of people were not likely to support the campaign spontaneously, we would have to develop newer forms to highlight this social issue. So, the campaign (concentrated on) influencing the attitudes of people against the test, daughters, women in general; of women themselves who would readily sacrifice anything for sons; the medical community and other informed persons.\\" = Right to work and better workplace conditions = The ban on bar dancers in Maharashtra was seen as raising the right to work and the right to better work conditions for all strata of women. In a 2013 statement on the case of the Indian diplomat in New York and her domestic helper, FAOW issued a statement: \\"There are hundreds of thousands on domestic workers from developing countries like India, Sri Lanka , the Philippines etc. working in their own countries as well as in the developed world. When they work abroad, they leave their families and homes and go out to be able to earn more so that they can begin to live a little more comfortable life once they are old and cannot work. For most domestic workers, working here or abroad, this is a distant dream. The abuse these workers have to live with here as well as abroad is something one can barely imagine. Hence it is very disturbing that very few political parties or individuals have bothered to look at this issue and make it a big enough political plank for all the powerful to take note. ...We urge the Government of India to immediately sign and implement ILO Convention 189 on the rights of domestic workers and to take concrete steps of ensure the dignity and safety of citizens and working people inside and outside the country.\\" = Submission to the Justice Verma Commission = Along with other Mumbai groups, FAOW made a submission to the Justice Verma Commission that identified three concerns: > We hereby place our concerns before you. > First of all we think that the committee should look at the entire gamut of > sexual violence, not just ‚Äúextreme‚Äù or ‚Äúaggravated‚Äù cases.

This exercise of review for quicker investigation, > speedier justice and trial needs to be done for ALL cases of sexual assault. > Secondly while we totally support the need for quicker trials, we are not > sure if enhancement in punishment is a solution to the problem of sexual > assault.

The High Court of Australia overruled a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria, holding that the States could not tax the income of a Commonwealth officer. This resulted in conflict with the Privy Council that was ultimately resolved by the passage of Commonwealth law in 1907 to permit the States to tax the income of a Commonwealth officer. The constitutional foundation of the decision was overturned by the subsequent decision of the High Court in the 1920 Engineers' Case.  Background  The ability of a state to tax the income of a Commonwealth officer was one of the \\"constitutional loose ends\\" about the nature of the federal system and the legislative powers of the new Commonwealth that remained unresolved following the debates in the constitutional conventions. =The High Court and the Privy Council= One of the issues debated in the drafting of the Constitution was the respective roles of the High Court and the Privy Council. The draft constitution that was put to voters in the various colonies was that there was to be no appeal to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or of the Constitution of a State, unless it involved the interests of some other dominion.See for example This was not acceptable to the British, who insisted on a compromise. Section 74 as ultimately enacted by the Imperial Parliament provided that if the dispute was between the Commonwealth and a state as to the extent of their respective powers under the Constitution, there could only be an appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council if the High Court granted a certificate \\"that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council\\".. It was anticipated that this may give rise to conflict between the High Court and the Privy Council because the Privy Council could still hear an appeal directly from a state court. The view that was supported in the House of Lords was that the view of the Privy Council would prevail \\"as it was the decision of Her Majesty herself as the fountain of justice, administering justice throughout her Empire at home and abroad. p 1365-72. One of the consequences of the concurrent appellate jurisdiction of the High Court and the Privy Council was that it was the unsuccessful litigant in the Supreme Court who had the choice of jurisdiction and the Commonwealth had no direct power to limit appeals from a State Supreme Court as the Constitutional limitation only applied to appeals from the High Court. The way in which the Commonwealth dealt with this issue in the Judiciary Act 1903, was by section 30, which gave the High Court \\"original jurisdiction in all matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation\\", sections 38 and 39 then removed the jurisdiction of the State Courts on such matters, but then gave it back to them in section 39 under the guise of Federal jurisdiction in which there was no appeal to the Privy Council and instead only an appeal to the High Court. =Wollaston's case= The Full Court of the Supreme Court, Madden CJ, Williams & √† Beckett JJ, had held in 1902 that Dr Harry Wollaston was required to pay Victorian income tax in relation to the salary he received as the Commonwealth Comptroller-General of Customs.In re the Income Tax Acts (No 4) (Wollaston's case) (1902) 28 VLR 357. The Court considered and rejected the applicability of decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in the interpretation of the Constitution of Australia, in particular the decision in McCulloch v. Maryland,McCulloch v. Maryland 4 Wheat. 316; Instead the Supreme Court applied the Privy Council decision in The Bank of Toronto v Lambe,. holding that the Privy Council had refused to apply the principle from McCulloch v Maryland and that it cannot govern the construction of the Australian Constitution. =D'Emden v Pedder= The High Court held in D'Emden v Pedder that the salary receipts of federal government employees were not subject to state stamp duty. Wollaston's case was cited in argument,D'Emden v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91 at p 98-100. as that the applicability of the principle in McCulloch v Maryland, to the Constitution was negatived by the decision of the Privy Council in The Bank of Toronto v Lambe. In response Griffith CJ stated \\"The decision in the case of The Bank of Toronto v Lambe merely amounts to this ‚Äì that under sec. 92 [of the Constitution of Canada] the Provinces have the power of direct taxation\\". The judgement of the Court, delivered by Griffith CJ, did not refer to Wollaston's case nor The Bank of Toronto v Lambe and instead held that \\"that some, if not all, of the framers of that Constitution were familiar, not only with the Constitution of the United States, but with that of the Canadian Dominion and those of the British colonies. When, therefore, under these circumstances, we find embodied, in the Constitution provisions undistinguishable in substance, though varied in form, from provisions of the Constitution of the United States which had long since been judicially interpreted by the Supreme Court of that Republic, it is not an unreasonable inference that its framers intended that like provisions should receive like interpretation.\\"D'Emden v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91 at p 113. The Court subsequently described the Constitution as \\"framed in Australia by Australians, and for the use of the Australian people\\".Peterswald v Bartley (1904) 1 CLR 497 at 509. The three inaugural judges of the High Court had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution, at [48]-[49]. thus when the Court spoke of what was framers of the Constitution knew or intended their Honours are referring to their personal experience in that process, and not to the intention or knowledge of the Imperial Parliament in passing the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. =Webb v Deakin & Lyne in the Supreme Court= The question again arose in relation to the incomes of members of the Australian Parliament. In assessing the income of Alfred Deakin and Sir William Lyne, the Victorian Commissioner of Taxes had included their salaries as members of parliament, ¬£233, and as Ministers, ¬£1,650. Deakin lived in Victoria and was the member for Ballaarat. He was also the Attorney- General under then Prime Minister Barton. Lyne lived in New South Wales and was the member for Hume and in 1902 was the Minister for Home Affairs. At the time Parliament sat in Melbourne and so he was required to be in Melbourne whenever Parliament was sitting. required Parliament to sit in Melbourne until the establishment of the national capital, now Canberra. Deakin and Lyne objected to the assessment and the Commissioner stated cases for the opinion of the Supreme Court as to whether the assessments were correct to include Commonwealth salaries and this was again referred to the Full Court. The outcome of the case would directly affect the interests of both Barton J and O'Connor J as they were in essentially the same position as Lyne, having previously been members of parliament and living in NSW. The issue would also affect any High Court judge, as the same question would arise when the High Court was sitting in Melbourne, as it did in this case. In essence, the question for the Supreme Court of Victoria was whether they followed their earlier decision in Wollaston's case or whether they adopted the approach of the High Court in D'Emden v Pedder. In the Supreme Court, the Commissioner was represented by Isaacs , while Deakin and Lyne were represented by Higgins .Both Isaacs and Higgins were also members of Parliament, however each maintained a practice as a barrister at the Victorian Bar, witand each appearing in Wollaston's case. The Full Court, Madden CJ, √† Beckett & Hodges JJ, decided to follow their earlier decision in Wollaston's case, holding that \\"As to the applicability of the United States cases, the opinions of the learned Judges in D'Emden v Pedder which apparently lean towards such applicability are merely dicta, and incomplete dicta at that, and we do not regard them therefore as binding upon us.\\" The Court noted the issue as to the ultimate court of appeal, stating that the Privy Council was \\"at least a concurrent Court of ultimate appeal with the High Court\\", and the final ascertainment of the law on the matter would depend on the relation of one Court to the other.. Argument In the High Court Deakin and Lyne continued to be represented by Higgins , apparently in his capacity as the then Attorney-General,Deakin v Webb (1904) 1 CLR 585 at p 588-601. and the Commissioner continued to be represented by Isaacs . The argument recorded in the Commonwealth Law Reports does not set out any objection that the decision would directly affect the interests of the judges.The Court subsequently overruled an objection on those grounds in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1090 holding it was a case of case of necessity as every Justice would have the same interest. The arguments for Deakin and Lyne were that their salaries were not earned in Victoria, but in Australia as a whole. The tax was unlawful as an interference between an officer of the Commonwealth and the Government. The Commissioner argued that income tax was a personal obligation that did not depend upon the source of the income being from the Commonwealth, the Income Tax Act 1895 was a valid Act in 1895 and did not become invalid as a result of the passage of the Constitution.  Decision of the High Court  On the principles of interpretation, the Court adhered to what it had said D'Emden v Pedder, that the principles to be applied in interpreting the Australian Constitution, so far as regards the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States were substantially the same as those laid down in McCulloch v Maryland. The Court described the judgement of the Supreme Court of Victoria as \\"a somewhat novel mode of dealing with a judgment of a Court of final appeal\\".Deakin v Webb (1904) 1 CLR 585 at p 604. Their Honours rejected the assertion that there was a preference for American decisions, or any disregard for British decisions, instead holding that the distinction was based on the deliberate adoption by the framers of the Australian Constitution of the language of the United States Constitution and a rejection of the scheme of the Canadian Constitution. =Certificate under s 74= This case was considered to be a dispute between the Commonwealth and a State as to the extend of their respective powers under the Constitution. As such there could only be an appeal to the Privy Council if the High Court granted a certificate \\"that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council\\". It was argued for the Commissioner of Taxes that the question was one of importance to the States and desire of the people of the states, expressed through the State premiers, was that the Privy Council should deal with the matter. Each of the Judges rejected the application, finding that the determination of Constitutional questions was the responsibility of the High Court.Deakin v Webb (1904) 1 CLR 585 at p 619-31. Webb v Outtrim in the Privy Council The Victorian Commissioner of Taxes did not accept the decision of the High Court and assessed the taxable income of Mr Outram as including the salary he received from the Commonwealth as the Deputy Postmaster-General. The Supreme Court of Victoria followed the decision of the High Court in Deakin v Webb. As the unsuccessful litigant, the Commissioner of Taxes sought leave to appeal to the Privy Council rather than the High Court. Hodges J held that the Supreme Court of Victoria had power under the Order in Council of 9 June 1860 to grant leave to appeal to the Privy Council, and that the Commonwealth Parliament had no power to take away this right of appeal.. The only Australian counsel involved in the appeal was Bernhard Wise who was led by Sir Robert Finlay for the Commissioner of Taxes. [1957] Melbourne University Law Review 4. The Privy Council held that a State government could tax Commonwealth officials and criticised the decisions of the High Court in D'Emden v Pedder and Deakin v Webb. Their Lordships held that the relevant question was not the intention of the Australians who framed the Constitution, but rather what the British Parliament had in mind when it passed the Constitution Act. The opinion of the Privy Council states that \\"The American Union, on the other hand, has erected a tribunal which possesses jurisdiction to annul a Statute upon the ground that it is unconstitutional\\" The basis for this statement is unclear as the United States Constitution contains no express provision to endow the Supreme Court of the United States with special powers and the relevant provisions were identical with those creating the High Court in Australia.Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1125 per Griffith CJ. There is nothing in the opinion to suggest the Privy Council had been referred to the decision in Marbury v. Madison that asserted such jurisdiction,Marbury v. Madison a decision that was at the time controversial.Jefferson, Thomas. The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, Letter to William Jarvis (28 September 1820). The judgement held that an Act of Parliament could be held to be inoperative to the extent it was repugnant to an Imperial Act extending to the Colony, but otherwise \\"no authority exists by which its validity can be questioned or impeached\\". Despite this the judgment stated that no State of the Australian Commonwealth has the power of independent legislation possessed by the States of the American Union because every Act of the Victorian Council and Assembly requires the assent of the Crown. The Privy Council then went on to hold that sections of the Judiciary Act (Cth) were themselves invalid.; . =Criticism of the Privy Council decision= The decision of the Privy Council has been criticised in Australia on the basis that the constitutional question was one upon which the decision of the High Court should have been final and that the Privy Council should have respected the spirit of the Constitution and avoided conflict with the High Court. In 1957 a proponent for abolishing appeals to the Privy Council described it as an egregious blunder, stating \\"Even the most fervent admirer of the erudition (sic) of the Judicial Committee, even the most ardent believer in the strength of this 'bond of empire', is hardly likely to be impressed by the judgment delivered by Lord Halsbury in the name of the Committee. Halsbury's name is associated with a number of judgments of dubious value; but if he were responsible for preparing as well as pronouncing the statement of reasons in Webb v Outtrim, it can only be said that on this occasion even Halsbury surpassed himself in the puerility of some of his reasons and in his fantastic ignorance of the working of a federation under the Crown\\". [1957] Res Judicatae 78. Even the reply from a supporter of the Privy Council described it as \\"perhaps the worst decision ever given by an ultimate court of appeal\\", which the author attributed to dealing with a system of law which differed markedly from that in which the members of the tribunal and almost all counsel had spent their professional life. Aftermath =Return to the High Court= The question returned to the High Court in May 1907 in two cases heard together, Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW), in which the judgement addressed the substantive issue, and Flint v Webb, which addressed the applications for a certificate to appeal to the Privy Council. The decision of the Privy Council in Webb v Outtrim had been followed by Murray DCJ in the NSW District Court, finding that Baxter was liable to pay NSW income tax in respect of his salary as a Customs officer. Similarly the Court of Petty Sessions of Victoria had followed the Privy Council and had found that Flint was liable to pay Victorian income tax in respect of his salary in the Postmaster-General's Department. Both Baxter and Flint appealed directly to the High Court. The Court held that these appeals concerned an inter se question such that an appeal lay to the High Court. The High Court held that it was, in the absence of a certificate under s 74 of the Constitution, the ultimate arbiter on all inter se questions such that it was not bound to follow the decision of the Privy Council in Webb v Outtrim. The High Court reconsidered the position, but reaffirmed its decision in D'Emden v Pedder. Griffith CJ delivered the \\"rather pugnacious judgment\\" of the majority as follows : > It was common knowledge [at the time of Federation], not only that the > decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian cases had not given > widespread satisfaction, but also that the Constitution of the United States > was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian > publicists it was almost as familiar as the British Constitution. It was > known that, even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee > familiar with the subject, it was quite uncertain whether they would form > members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on > appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with > in the first instance. It could not be predicted of the Board, which would > sit to entertain an appeal, that it would be constituted with any regard to > the special familiarity of its members with the subject. And no disrespect > is implied in saying that the eminent lawyers who constituted the Judicial > Committee were not regarded either as being familiar with the history or > conditions of the remoter portions of the Empire, or as having any > sympathetic understanding of the aspirations of the younger communities > which had long enjoyed the privilege of self-government. On the other hand, > the founders of the Australian Constitution were familiar with the part > which the Supreme Court of the United States, constituted of Judges imbued > with the spirit of American nationality, and knowing that the nation must > work out its own destiny under the Constitution as framed, or as amended > from time to time, had played in the development of the nation, and the > harmonious working of its political institutions.Baxter v Commissioners of > Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1111-2 per Griffith CJ. The success of the argument put by Higgins on behalf of his clients in Deakin v Webb did not sit well with him, writing in 1905 that \\"The man in the street is startled and puzzled. He sees a public official, enjoying a regular salary in the postal department, paying the Victorian income-tax until federation, and then suddenly exempted from the tax because the post-office has passed over to federal control.\\" Having been appointed to the High Court along with Isaacs J in 1906, Higgins J set out his dissenting views in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) that: > It is true that I have held, and still hold, a strong opinion with regard to > the judgment of Marshall CJ in McCulloch v Maryland ‚Äì the judgment on which > Deakin v Webb was based ‚Äì although I utter the opinion with a feeling that > it will be regarded by some as almost blasphemy. I regard it as being the > utterance rather of the statesman than of the lawyer.Baxter v Commissioners > of Taxation (NSW) (1907) 4 CLR 1087 at p 1164 per Higgins J. In Flint v Webb the Court unanimously declined to issue a certificate to appeal to the Privy Council, with each judge finding that the fact that there was a decision of the Privy Council that was inconsistent with a previous decision of the High Court, where the High Court had refused a certificate of appeal, was inconvenient, but that was not itself a sufficient reason to grant a certificate. Griffith CJ suggested two ways to escape the inconvenient position, (1) make the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court on federal matters exclusive of the State Supreme Court or (2) legislate that the income provided to federal public servants was subject to the rights of the States to tax them.Flint v Webb (1907) 4 CLR 1178 at p. 1187 per Griffith CJ. Higgins J described the suggestion that the Commonwealth be deprived of the appellate assistance of the very efficient State Courts as an extreme step. His Honour doubted that the issue could be resolved by federal legislation given that the majority's view in Deakin v Webb rested on constitutional grounds and the federal Parliament had no power to alter the constitution.Flint v Webb (1907) 4 CLR 1178 at p. 1194 per Higgins J. =Legislative response= The decisions of the High Court in Baxter v Commissioners of Taxation (NSW) and Flint v Webb were handed down in June 1907. In September the federal Parliament responded to the conflict, adopting both measures identified by Griffith CJ, passing the Commonwealth Salaries Act 1907, which dealt with the substantive dispute by expressly permitting the States to tax the income of Commonwealth officers, and the Judiciary Act 1907, which gave the High Court exclusive jurisdiction \\"in matters involving any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the constitutional power of any two or more of the States\\". The practical effect of the Judiciary Act amendment was that as no State Court could give a decision on an inter se question, there was no decision to appeal to the Privy Council other than one from the High Court and that required a certificate from the High Court.It was still theoretically possible to appeal to the Privy Council from an inferior court however this possibility was considered remote: =No return to the Privy Council= Despite the failure to obtain certificates under s 74 of the Constitution, the NSW and Victorian commissioners of taxation sought leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The decision of the Privy Council did not address the need for a certificate to appeal and instead declined special leave to appeal primarily on the grounds that the Commonwealth Salaries Act meant the controversy could not arise again.; . Despite the policy of the Australian Labor Party from 1908 that appeals to the Privy Council should be abolished, it took no legislative action to implement that policy, (1959) 33 Australian Law Journal 196. and appeals to the Privy Council never became a major political issue. There were calls among lawyers and academics in the 1950s for the abolition of such appeals, however there was no legislative response until 1968, abolishing appeals in matters involving federal legislation,Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 (Cth). 1975, abolishing almost all appeals from the High Court,Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975 (Cth). and 1986 which abolished appeals from State Courts.Australia Act 1986 Imperial and Commonwealth (with the request and consent of the Australian States).

She is currently the only female chef in America to attain three Michelin stars, for her restaurant Atelier Crenn, in San Francisco, California. Biography Crenn, originally from Locronan, was adopted at 18 months by a French couple from Versailles. She spent many summers in Brittany at the family farm. Her mother, a cook with an \\"adventurous palate, took her young daughter to experience Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese restaurants in Paris.\\" Her father, a politician, would take his daughter along when he dined at Michelin star restaurants with his friend, a food critic for Le T√©l√©gramme. Crenn's experience on the family farm, her mother's cooking, and her visits to high-profile restaurants developed her culinary tastes. Disliking the male-dominated French culinary scene, she earned a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in international business. In December 2019, Crenn became engaged to her girlfriend, actress Maria Bello.  Career  Crenn moved to the United States to pursue her culinary aspirations, landing in San Francisco in the late 1980s. Her first restaurant position was at Stars, a prominent restaurant in the city run by celebrity chef Jeremiah Tower. After two years, she moved on to work at restaurants such as Campton Place, 2223 Market, and Yoyo Bistro at the Miyako Hotel before taking a position as head chef for the restaurant in Intercontinental Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. She was Indonesia's first ever female head chef, but was forced to flee the country during civil unrest in 1998. Returning to the United States, she became executive chef for Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles, California and then at Abode Restaurant and Lounge in Santa Monica, California. In 2008, management at Intercontinental Hotel offered her a new position, and she joined Luce in San Francisco where she was awarded her first Michelin star in 2009, and was awarded another one-star ranking the next year. In 2011, she opened her restaurant Atelier Crenn in San Francisco, California. The Michelin Guide awarded the restaurant a two-star ranking, making Crenn the first ever female chef to receive two stars in the United States. Atelier Crenn was again awarded two stars in 2014. She was awarded the Best female Chef in 2016 by world‚Äôs 50 Best Restaurant awards. Crenn appeared on Season 2 of Chef's Table, a documentary film series on Netflix. In 2018, Crenn earned her third Michelin star. Petit Crenn, inspired by the food of her childhood in Brittany, opened in 2015. In 2016, Crenn announced plans to open Bar Crenn, a wine bar featuring small plates, next door to Atelier Crenn. In March 2018, Bar Crenn opened, earning one Michelin star in its first year, which means Crenn currently holds four Michelin stars. In 2018, Crenn was awarded the James Beard Foundation Award of Best Chef: West.  Cooking philosophy  Crenn sees herself as an artist, referring to her dishes as \\"poetic culinaria.\\" Katie McLaughlin notes in a profile of Crenn for The Wall Street Journal that Atelier Crenn \\"serves a cuisine so visually, texturally, and conceptually inventive it has both delighted and baffled critics and drawn international attention.\\" Crenn is known to treat her staff well, avoiding the yelling and scrutiny that was common in professional kitchens for decades. She is also known to greet her guests, walking from table to table to do so.

It is a Reform Jewish Synagogue located at 5959 N. Sheridan, Chicago, IL. History Fourteen German-speaking Jews founded Emanuel Congregation in 1880. The first president of Emanuel Congregation was Zacharias Sinzheimer. Originally founded on Orthodox ideology, Emanuel gradually shifted towards Reform Judaism by adopting Minhag America in 1889, choosing to worship with uncovered heads, and, finally, uniting with Congregation Or Chadosh in 1894. Another notable change in the early years of the congregation is its formal shift from speaking German to English in 1901. Between the years 1880 and 1923, the congregation had only six rabbis, with Rabbi Felix A. Levy serving for forty-seven years. During Rabbi Levy's time, the congregation grew considerably, with over three hundred members at one point during the time he served. While there were times of higher membership, such as during Rabbi Levy's time, there were also multiple times when Emanuel Congregation's membership dwindled, which was often due to the northward movement of the members. In order to continue to serve their members, the congregation moved locations, such as in 1896 when membership was declining and the congregation moved to a lot on Buckingham Place near Halsted Street, where they built a new building. In 1916, the building at this location was badly damaged by a fire. After this, the building was rebuilt and rededicated. The congregation grew once again, which led to another location change in 1949 to a lot on Sheridan Road at Thorndale Avenue. The newly built temple was dedicated in 1955 and is where Emanuel Congregation currently resides.

According to the Atlantic Monthly, Karl Widerquist is \\"a leader of the worldwide basic income movement.\\"  Biography  Karl Widerquist was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1965 and grew up in Cassopolis, Michigan. Before entering academia, he was a musician, including a stint as bass player for Michael McDermott, and played in several indie bands.‚ÄúPersonal Web Page of Karl Widerquist,‚Äù at widerquist.com/karl/personal.html He completed a Ph.D. in economics at the Graduate Center, CUNY in 1996, and one in Political Theory at the University of Oxford in 2006. Since 2009, he has been at Georgetown University-Qatar.‚ÄúAbout BIEN,‚Äù at basicincome.org He has appeared frequently in print, and on radio and television news networks.  Advocacy of basic income  Widerquist has been a supporter of some form of basic income guarantee since he heard the topic discussed on an episode of Milton Friedman's television show Free to Choose at the age of 15 in 1980. He did not start writing, working, or publishing on the topic until the late 1990s. Widerquist has worked on basic income as an economist, a political theorist, a public policy analyst, and an organizer. In 1999, Widerquist co-founded the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee (USBIG) Network along with Michael A. Lewis, Fred Block, Charles M. A. Clark, and Pamela Donovan. Widerquist chaired the organization until 2008 and edited its email NewsFlash until 2014. Widerquist was the co-chair of the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) since 2008-2017. In 2011, together with Yannick Vanderborght, Widerquist co-founded BIEN's news website, Basic Income News, serving as its principal writer and editor until 2014, and he still periodically contributes to it. Along with BIEN's other co- chair, Louise Haagh, Widerquist chartered BIEN as a non-profit organization in 2016 and oversaw the expansion of BIEN's activities. Widerquist's writing on basic income includes several articles reexamining the results of the negative income tax experiments conducted in the United States and Canada in the 1970s.Karl Widerquist, 2005. ‚ÄúA Failure to Communicate: What (If Anything) Can we Learn from the Negative Income Tax Experiments?‚Äù the Journal of Socio- Economics 34 (1): 49‚Äì81 He and Michael Howard co-edited two books on Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend, addressing it as a working model of a small basic income.Karl Widerquist and Michael W. Howard (eds.) 2012. Alaska‚Äôs Permanent Fund Dividend: Examining its Suitability as a Model, New York: Palgrave MacmillanKarl Widerquist and Michael W. Howard (eds.) 2012. Exporting the Alaska Model: Adapting the Permanent Fund Dividend for Reform around the World, New York: Palgrave Macmillan He has contributed to studies estimating that the United States could provide a full basic income at a cost of 2.95% of GDP per year and that the United Kingdom could provide a full basic income at a cost about 3.4% of GDP. He has been critical of the 'reciprocity' or 'exploitation' objection to basic income. Under these objections, people who receive basic income without work are said to fail in the duty of reciprocity by accepting social benefits without contributing to their production and thereby are said to exploit workers who do produce those benefits. Widerquist contends that the distribution of ownership of resources violates the principle of reciprocity, because the law gives ownership of the Earth's resources to a limited group of people without compensation for the loss of the commons for others. Therefore, Widerquist argues, in order to be consistent with reciprocity, those who hold resources must make an unconditional payment to those who do not.Karl Widerquist, 1999. ‚ÄúReciprocity and the Guaranteed Income‚Äù Politics and Society, 33 (3): 386‚Äì401 Assuming this argument is held true, then instead of violating reciprocity, basic income is in fact required by that very principle. Widerquist further argues that basic income, so conceived, does not exploit workers because it does not matter how one gets control of resources (through work, inheritance, or any other means). What is critical is that anyone's ownership of resources must not be part of a system that imposes propertylessness on others.Karl Widerquist, 2006. ‚ÄúWho Exploits Who?‚Äù Political Studies 54 (3): 444‚Äì464 The absence of propertylessness is important not only to ensure that the privatization of resources is consistent with reciprocity but also to protect all workers from vulnerability to exploitation by their employers.Karl Widerquist, 2010. ‚ÄúThe Physical Basis of Voluntary Trade,‚Äù Human Rights Review 11 (1): 83‚Äì103 This view of property rights as something that both protects owners from interference and imposes interference on non-owners is a running theme throughout much of Widerquist's writing and his arguments for basic income. This idea is closely related to left-libertarian or Georgist views of property, which are based on the principles of self-ownership and some principle of equal access to natural resources.Vallentyne, P. and H. Steiner (2000), The Origins of Left-Libertarianism: An anthology of historical writings. Basingstoke: Palgrave. Left-libertarians argue that this view of resource rights is more consistent with negative freedom than any other view because the establishment and enforcement of property rights inherently interfere with non-owners in substantive ways and in a negative sense of the term.Vallentyne, P. and H. Steiner (2000b), Left-Libertarianism and Its Critics: The Contemporary Debate. New York: Palgrave Widerquist does not endorse the whole of either of those theories of justice. Instead, he presents his theory of justice as a separate ideology, which he calls ‚Äújustice as the pursuit of accord‚Äù or ‚Äúindepentarianism.‚Äù The central difference between this theory and more mainstream left-libertarianism is that it rejects the left- libertarian view that equal access to resources entitles people to an equal share of the market value of natural resources.Vallentyne, P. (2000). ‚ÄúLeft- Libertarianism - A Primer,‚Äù in P. Vallentyne and H. Steiner, Eds.). Left- Libertarianism and Its Critics: The Contemporary Debate. New York: Palgrave, 1‚Äì22 Widerquist instead argues that disadvantage might be entitled to greater redistribution larger than what would be required to equalize the income generated by natural resources.Karl Widerquist, March 2013. Independence, Propertylessness, and Basic Income: A Theory of Freedom as the Power to Say No, New York: Palgrave Macmillan He makes several arguments for this position, the most important of which is that respect for equal freedom requires that any legitimate authority protects individuals from the most substantively important interference. This principle, Widerquist argues, requires respect for individuals‚Äô status as free individuals, which in turn requires economic independence. Individuals need access to enough resources to ensure that they are not forced by propertylessness to serve the interests of people empowered to give them access to resources. Widerquist calls this concept ‚Äúfreedom as independence‚Äù or ‚Äúfreedom as the power to say no.‚Äù He argues that respect for independence in the present socio-economic context requires redistribution to come at least in part in the form of an unconditional basic income and that it must be at least enough to meet an individual's basic needs. He also argues that basic income is more effective in protecting vulnerable individuals from exploitation and other forms of economic distress than traditional conditional welfare state policies. Widerquist is not the first to recognize that poverty effectively forces individuals to work in service to more advantaged individuals, nor is he the first to argue that basic income can relieve that effective force. The unique feature of his theory is the central role that it gives to ‚Äúthe power to say no‚Äù in an individual's status as a free person and the central role status freedom plays in his theory of justice. Since the mid-2010s, this line of argument seems to have become more important to the movement for basic income with two of the movement's long-term leaders, Philippe Van Parijs and Guy Standing, arguing along these lines in a TEDx Talk, ‚ÄúThe Instrument of Freedom‚Äù and an interview (respectively).  Empirical and anthropological criticism of contemporary political theory  Widerquist has done work both to clarify the concept of libertarianism and to criticize right-libertarianism version of it. He argues that the central principles that are meant to determine the just distribution of property in a right-libertarian economy can justify government ownership of the powers to tax, regulate, and redistribute property just as well as they can justify private ownership of property. It argues that no historical or principled reasons exist to believe that private owners holdings of their powers are any better justified than government holdings of its powers.Karl Widerquist, 2009. ‚ÄúA Dilemma for Libertarianism,‚Äù Politics, Philosophy, and Economics 8 (1): 43‚Äì72 Karl Widerquist has collaborated with anthropologist Grant S. McCall to use anthropological evidence to debunk claims in contemporary political theory.Grant S. McCall and Karl Widerquist, 2015. ‚ÄúThe Evolution of Equality: Rethinking Variability and Egalitarianism Among Modern Forager Societies.‚Äù Ethnoarchaeology 7 (1) March: 21‚Äì44Karl Widerquist and Grant S. McCall, 2015. ‚ÄúMyths about the State of Nature and the Reality of Stateless Societies.‚Äù Analyse & Kritik 37 (2), AugustKarl Widerquist and Grant McCall. Prehistoric Myths in Modern Political Philosophy, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, January 2017 They argue that, since the 1600s, most forms of social contract theory and natural property rights theory‚Äîespecially those associated with a ‚ÄúLockean proviso‚Äù or a Hobbesian justification of the state‚Äîhave relied on the false empirical claim that Widerquist and McCall identify as ‚Äúthe Hobbesian hypothesis.\\" That is, everyone is better off in a state society with a private property rights regime than everyone is, was, or would be in a society with neither of those institutions. Their book shows how the Hobbesian hypothesis has reappeared throughout the history of political thought since then and that it continues to be passed on in twenty-first century political theory. They argue that few of the philosophers who pass on the Hobbesian hypothesis offer any evidence to support it. Widerquist and McCall present several chapters of evidence making that comparison and showing that the Hobbesian hypothesis is false: the least advantaged people in contemporary state society are actually worse off than the remaining native peoples who live outside the reach of the authority of the state or the property rights system. Therefore, if either of the two theories is to successfully justify the state and/or the property rights system, societies have to treat their disadvantaged individuals much better than they do now. Widerquist and McCall‚Äôs second book, the Prehistory of Private Property, debunks the beliefs that private property is somehow ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù that a capitalist system with strongly individualistic property rights is more consistent with negative liberty than other systems, and that economic equality is impossible or somehow in conflict with negative liberty. To do so they present a great deal of evidence about the types of land-holding institutions indigenous people have created throughout history and prehistory and about the government-sponsored violence that was necessary to establish the capitalist private property system.  Other political and economic theories  Widerquist has argued that Thomas Piketty's observation that the rate of return on capital tends to exceed the growth rate in the economy should be seen as an outcome of the institutional setting rather than as a natural law of capitalism.Karl Widerquist, 2015. ‚ÄúThe Piketty Observation Against the Institutional Background: How natural is this natural tendency and what can we do about it?‚Äù Basic Income Studies 10 (1), June, 83‚Äì90 Widerquist has also examined the effect of relaxing public choice theory‚Äôs assumption of self-interested behavior. He shows that many public choice problems exist as long as political actors are rational and disagree about what government should do, even if their disagreement stems from adherence to competing ethical theories rather than from competing self-interested wants.Karl Widerquist, 2003. ‚ÄúPublic Choice and Altruism,‚Äù the Eastern Economic Journal 29 (3): 277‚Äì278 Although Widerquist's work uses some sufficientarian assumptions, he criticized other aspects of sufficientarianism.Karl Widerquist, 2010. ‚ÄúHow the Sufficiency Minimum Becomes a Social Maximum,‚Äù Utilitas 22 (4): 474‚Äì480 He has done historical work examining the many different (and often contradictory) ways that Lockean appropriation theory has been interpreted and revised.Karl Widerquist, 2010. ‚ÄúLockean Theories of Property: Justifications for Unilateral Appropriation,‚Äù Public Reason 2 (3): 3‚Äì26 He has written critically about wage subsidies as a redistributive strategy.Karl Widerquist, 2008. ‚ÄúProblems with Wage Subsidies: Phelps‚Äôs economic discipline and undisciplined economics‚Äù International Journal of Green Economics 2 (3): 329‚Äì339  Books  * Michael Anthony Lewis and Karl Widerquist, 2002.

Tail vibration should not be confused with caudal luring, where the tail is twitched in order to attract prey. While rattlesnakes are perhaps the most famous group of snakes to exhibit tail vibration behavior, many other snake groups‚Äîparticularly those in the Colubridae and Viperidae families‚Äîare known to vibrate their tails.  Description  = Process = Tail vibration involves the rapid shaking of the tail in response to a predatory threat. The behavior is particularly widespread among New World species of Viperidae and Colubridae.Allf, Bradley C., Paul AP Durst, and David W. Pfennig. \\"Behavioral Plasticity and the Origins of Novelty: The Evolution of the Rattlesnake Rattle.\\" The American Naturalist 188.4 (2016): 475‚Äì483Young, Bruce A. \\"Snake bioacoustics: toward a richer understanding of the behavioral ecology of snakes.\\" The Quarterly review of biology 78.3 (2003): 303‚Äì325 However, some Typhlopidae and Boidae species may also tail vibrate.Lazell, James D. ‚Äú1988. ‚ÄúTyphlops braminus (Brahminy Blind Snake) rattling. Herpetological Review 19.4 (1988): 85Greene, Harry W. \\"Defensive tail display by snakes and amphisbaenians.\\" Journal of Herpetology (1973): 143-161 At least one species of lizard‚ÄîTakydromus tachydromoides‚Äîhas been shown to tail vibrate in response to a potential predator.Mori, Akira. \\"Tail vibration of the Japanese grass lizard Takydromus tachydromoides as a tactic against a snake predator.\\" Journal of Ethology 8.2 (1990): 81‚Äì88 Tail vibration behavior in rattlesnakes is somewhat different from tail vibration in other snakes because rattlesnakes hold their tails vertically when tail vibrating, whereas other snakes hold the tail horizontally. Presumably, this is because the rattlesnake rattle produces its own noise, which would be diminished by the exterior of the rattle contacting the ground, and, conversely, snakes without rattles must vibrate the tail against the ground or some other object in order to make noise. Rattlesnakes tail vibrate with the tail held vertically while other snakes tail vibrate horizontally. = Speed = The speed of tail vibration is directly correlated with temperature, at least for rattlesnakes. The warmer a rattlesnake, the faster it vibrates its tail.Martin, James H., and Roland M. Bagby. \\"Temperature-frequency relationship of the rattlesnake rattle.\\" Copeia (1972): 482‚Äì485 Rattlesnakes tail-vibrate faster than other snakes, with some individuals nearing or exceeding 90 rattles per second.Allf BC, Durst PAP, Pfennig DW (2016) Data from: Behavioral plasticity and the origins of novelty: the evolution of the rattlesnake rattle. Dryad Digital Repository. https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c36k6Schaeffer, P. J. K. E., K. Conley, and S. Lindstedt. \\"Structural correlates of speed and endurance in skeletal muscle: the rattlesnake tailshaker muscle.\\" Journal of experimental Biology 199.2 (1996): 351‚Äì358 This makes rattlesnake tail vibration one of the fastest sustained vertebrate movements‚Äîfaster than the wingbeat of a hummingbird. The movement is possible thanks to specialized ‚Äúshaker‚Äù muscles in the rattlesnake tail. Snakes more closely related to rattlesnakes vibrate more quickly than do more distant rattlesnake relatives. In one study that measured tail vibration in 155 snakes representing 56 species, vibratory speed ranged from 9 vibrations per second (Bothriopsis taeniata) to 91 rattles per second (Crotalus polystictus). In the study, only two rattlesnakes (of 33 individuals filmed) had a maximum vibratory rate slower than the fastest non-rattlesnakes. The fastest non-rattlesnakes examined were species of Agkistrodon and New World Colubrids, both of which could sustain vibratory speeds up to about 50 rattles per second. It is unknown what benefit a snake derives from such fast speeds of tail vibration. One study did find that ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi, are able to ascertain the threat level posed by a rattlesnake based on its rattling speed.Owings, Donald H., Matthew P. Rowe, and Aaron S. Rundus. \\"The rattling sound of rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis) as a communicative resource for ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) and burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia).\\" Journal of Comparative Psychology 116.2 (2002): 197 Thus, it is possible that fast rattling speeds could be driven by predator-mediated selection, whereby snake predators avoid faster-vibrating individuals. = Function = It is also unknown what the specific function of tail vibration is. Many researchersKlauber, Laurence M. Rattlesnakes. Vol. 1. Univ of California Press, 1956 have posited that it is primarily an auditory aposematic warning signal‚Äî like the growling of a wolf or the sound associated with African whistling thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium).Lev-Yadun, Simcha. \\"Does the whistling thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium) use auditory aposematism to deter mammalian herbivores?.\\" Plant Signaling & Behavior 11.8 (2016): e1207035 Others have suggested it could serve as a distraction‚Äîparticularly for nonvenomous species‚Äî meant to draw attention away from a snake‚Äôs head and towards its less vulnerable tail.Williams, George Christopher. Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought. Princeton University Press, 2008 It has also been suggested that tail-vibrating nonvenomous snakes sympatric with rattlesnakes may be Batesian mimics of rattlesnakes that gain protection from predators by mimicking the rattling sound produced by rattlesnakes (all of which are venomous). This hypothesis does not explain why Old World nonvenomous snakes also tail-vibrate, since rattlesnakes are solely a New World taxa.  Evolution  Tail vibration is widespread among Vipers and Colubrids, and the behavior may be deeply ancestral in both groups. Tail vibration behavior in rattlesnakes may have evolved from tail vibration in rattle-less ancestors. In support of this hypothesis are studies that show the similarity in specialized tail morphology and rate and duration of tail vibration between rattlesnakes are their closest relatives.Moon, Brad R. \\"Muscle Physiology and the Evolution of the Rattling System in Rattlesnakes.\\" Journal of Herpetology (2001): 497‚Äì500. Web The evolution of rattlesnake rattling from simple tail vibration behavior may, in fact, be an example of behavioral plasticity leading to the evolution of a novel phenotype. Other researchers have suggested that the rattle may have evolved originally to enhance caudal luring, and that caudal luring behavior therefore preceded defensive tail vibration in rattlesnakes.Schuett, Gordon W., David L. Clark, and Fred Kraus. \\"Feeding mimicry in the rattlesnake Sistrurus catenatus, with comments on the evolution of the rattle.\\" Animal Behaviour 32.2 (1984): 625‚Äì626 In support of this hypothesis, researchers suggest that a ‚Äúproto-rattle‚Äù would not have increased sound production since rattles require a certain threshold of complexity (at least two overlapping rings of keratin) in order to produce sound. Proponents of this hypothesis suggest that a proto-rattle may have enhanced caudal luring, a behavior common to rattlesnakes and their closest relatives, because such a structure might have looked similar to an arthropod head. Those in support of this hypothesis also point out that specialized keratinized structures have evolved in caudal luring species before, such as in the spider-tailed horned viper, Pseudocerastes urarachnoides. Opponents of the \\"caudal luring hypothesis\\" point out the lack of parsimony in such a process, since it would require the behavior to evolve from an offensive to a defensive context (extant rattlesnakes only use the rattle in defensive contexts). If rattlesnake rattling behavior evolved from tail vibration, it would require no such change in behavioral context. Additionally, some have suggested that a proto-rattle could have increased sound production if the modified tail tip increased noise production when vibrated against the substratum.Tiebout, Harry M. \\"Caudal luring by a temperate colubrid snake, Elaphe obsoleta, and its implications for the evolution of the rattle among rattlesnakes.\\" Journal of Herpetology 31.2 (1997): 290‚Äì292  See also  *Caudal luring *Batesian mimicry  References   Ethology ","title":"Tail vibration"},{"id":"52478476","text":"William M.

Each player controls a clan of mythological Vikings seeking glory as Ragnarok approaches. Played in three ages or rounds, Blood Rage features card drafting, battles and territory control via forces represented by sculpted plastic miniatures. All conflicts are resolved through playing cards, and cards are also used to improve and differentiate the different clans and the leaders, warriors, ships and monsters at their command. Based in part on Lang's 2007 design Midgard, the game was originally released on Kickstarter, raising just under $1 million. The game was well received, landing on the recommended list for the 2015 Kennerspiel des Jahres award for strategy game of the year. Gameplay At the beginning of each of the game's three ages or rounds, each player is dealt eight cards, keeping one and passing the rest to the player on their left, until players have six cards. There are cards which give bonuses in battle, upgrades which give special abilities to a player's forces or allow players to recruit monsters to fight on their behalf, and quests give short term victory point objectives. Each player's clan of Viking forces begins the same, but quickly differentiates itself based on the drafted cards. After drafting cards, each player takes turns sequentially, using the game's resource, Rage, to perform actions. These include upgrading a clan's abilities and forces, having those forces invade the map, or pillaging provinces. Pillaging further improves one's clan and scores points, and can lead to battles with other players. Battles are resolved without luck - players secretly play a card and add that to the strength of their forces in that region to determine the winner. At the end of each age, a portion of the board is removed as Ragnarok approaches, sending any forces on that part of the map to Valhalla and earning players glory (victory points) for each of their forces that were thus destroyed. The game supports a variety of different strategies depending on which cards the players draft, from controlling territories, winning battles, or even having one's own forces be destroyed, if a player has drafted cards that give points and bonuses for being defeated. In strategies and mechanics, the game merges the traditions of American style games and eurogames, combining the conflict and strong theme prevalent in the former with the statistics, upgrades and lack of chance common in the latter. Release and Reception Blood Rage was originally inspired by Lang's 2007 design Midgard. The game was launched on Kickstarter by CMON in March 2015 and delivered in November, and which point the game became widely available. One of the most publicized Kickstarter campaigns for designer board games of the year, the game was sold through Kickstarter to almost 10,000 backers, generating revenues of almost $1 million. Blood Rage has received consistently positive reviews, both for the quality of the gameplay and for the finely detailed plastic miniatures which represent the mythical monsters and Viking soldiers which battle on behalf of the players. Charlie Theel, writing for Ars Technica, said that Blood Rage \\"confirmed Eric Lang as one of the preeminent modern board gaming designers.\\" In 2019 CMON ran a Kickstarter campaign for a digital version of the game, which cost $15.

He was also a member of the Working Committee of the Centre for Indian Trade Unions.CPI(M), LEFT FRONT GOVERNMENT AND JUTE LABOUR : MOBILIZATION FROM ABOVE Youth Born in 1914, Ghosh grew up in Khulna. In 1930 he moved to Calcutta, where he joined the student movement. Around 1935/1936 he became a member of the Bengal Labour Party and active in workers activism. After about a year, he became a card-carrying member of the Communist Party of India (along with other Labour Party members). When the Labour Party broke with CPI, he renounced his CPI party membership. Return to the Communist Party In 1945 he again joined CPI. He became a key labour organizer amongst the Kidderpore dock workers and at Saxby and Farmers. Ghosh was jailed in 1948, and remained in prison until 1952. After being freed from jail, Ghosh took up a job at the CPI daily Swadhinata. Ghosh sided with CPI(M) in the party split. Ghosh won the Beliaghata North constituency seat in the 1967 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. He obtained 21,387 votes (42.63%). He retained the Beliaghata North seat in the 1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, obtaining 31,294 votes (66.10%). United Front ministry Ghosh was named Minister for Labour in the second United Front government of West Bengal, formed in 1969. As Labour Minister, Ghosh sought to support labour in its confrontation with corporate interests. With the CPI(M) in charge of both the Home and Labour departments, the police were instructed not to intervene against striking workers. Gheraos were effectively legalized. Salaries of workers increased as a result. In the first six months of the second United Front government there were 551 strikes and 73 lock-outs across the state, affecting some 570,000 workers. 1971 & 1972 assembly elections Ghosh retained the Beliaghata North seat in the 1971 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. He obtained 23,318 votes (53.40%), defeating the All India Forward Bloc candidate in a straight contest. In the 1972 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election he was defeated by Ananta Kumar Bharati of the Indian National Congress. Ghosh finished in second place with 14,839 votes (21.60%) Left Front ministry Ghosh won the Beliaghata constituency seat in the 1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. He obtained 29,201 votes (55.82%), defeating the Janata Party and INC candidates. Ghosh was again named Labour Minister in the Left Front government formed in 1977. His role in the Left Front government differed from that of the United Front experience, rather than unilaterally supporting labour he now sought to act as mediator between unions and employers. He retained the Beliaghata seat in the 1982 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, obtaining 44,277 votes (62.88%). Ghosh retired from his post as Labour Minister in 1985, due to old age.

Buenos Aires, Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata, August 18, 1739) was a Spanish soldier and administrator in the Spanish Empire. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Santa Fe between 1714-1716 and 1717-1722, and as Governor of Paraguay between 1725-1730\\\\. Under his direction as governor, the cities of Carapegu√° and Itaugu√° were founded, on May 14, 1725 and June 27, 1728, respectively.  Biography  Bar√∫a's early life is unclear. In early 1712, he was apparently a Captain and served as a judge in the Consejo Supremo de Hacienda, a tax court.Cabildo de Santa Fe (op. cit., T¬∫ VII ‚Äì f¬∫ 112 a 112v). Captain Bar√∫a was appointed by Governor of the R√≠o de la Plata Alonso de Arce y Soria to be Lieutenant Governor of the city Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz. He was sworn in on September 28, 1714.Cabildo de Santa Fe (op. cit., T¬∫ VII - f¬∫ 226v-229v). He served in this role until 1722, although Juan de Lacoizqueta took it over for a roughly year-long period between 1716-1717\\\\. By the order of the Viceroy of Peru, Jos√© de Armend√°riz, 1st Marquis of Castelfuerte, Bar√∫a was sent to Paraguay as governor after the troubles with disgraced judge Jos√© de Antequera y Castro that had eventually flared into armed resistance to the Empire. Bruno Mauricio de Zabala was serving as interim governor after leading an army to intimidate and depose Antequera, but Zabala was Governor of the R√≠o de la Plata (having replaced Acre), a wealthier and more important province than Paraguay. So that Zabala could return to his duties, Bar√∫a was sent to Asunci√≥n. His term as interim governor would last longer than expected, as two intended replacement governors failed to arrive: the first due to being arrested after beating his wife, and the second died in transit from Europe to South America.Lopez, p. 100-106. As Governor, Bar√∫a pursued a conciliatory policy with Antequera's supporters. The most heated issue in the province was the treatment of the Society of Jesus, who ran the nearby Jesuit reductions. Bar√∫a proved popular with the Paraguayans for defying the Jesuits, similar to Antequera. He only allowed the Jesuits back into their college in Asunci√≥n at the direct insistence and order of the Viceroy. Bar√∫a's policy helped keep the peace for 5 years, but did not resolve the fundamental split the province had between the Viceroy's policy and the Paraguayan's desired anti-Jesuit policy. When a replacement governor, Ignacio de Soroeta, was sent, the province of Paraguay was once more deeply unhappy; the settlers asked for Bar√∫a to stay on as governor. Bar√∫a, knowing that Antequera was rotting away in a jail cell, had no desire to commit treason against the Spanish Crown, and insisted that if he kept the governorship, it would only be to hand it over to Soroeta. He eventually resigned in disgust and left the province. The replacement of Bar√∫a and the rejection of Soroeta would go on to become the beginning of the second phase of the Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay.Lopez, p. 107-115.

SB-32 builds onto Assembly Bill (AB) 32 written by Senator Fran Pavley and Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez passed into law on September 27, 2006. AB-32 required California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and SB-32 continues that timeline to reach the targets set in Executive Order B-30-15. SB-32 provides another intermediate target between the 2020 and 2050 targets set in Executive Order S-3-05. SB-32 was contingent on the passing of AB-197, which increases legislative oversight of CARB and is intended to ensure CARB must report to the Legislature. AB-197 also passed and was signed into law on September 8, 2016.  Background  The global community recognized the climate trends most recently at the 21st yearly session of the Conference of Parties (COP 21) in Paris, where a universal commitment to reduce average ‚Äúglobal temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.‚Äù Climate science dictates that global warming of more than 2 ¬∞C would have serious consequences, beyond those already being experienced, such as an increase in the number of extreme climate events. In order to avoid a global average surface temperature increase of 2 ¬∞C, global GHG emissions need to be reduced by 40‚Äì70% by 2050 and carbon neutrality (i.e. zero emissions) needs to be reached by the end of the century at the latest. The United States pledged at the Paris COP 21, ‚Äúto achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26‚Äì28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%‚Äù Prior to the Paris agreements, which have not domestically been ratified by a two-thirds Senate vote, the US did not have any binding national GHG reduction targets. In light of the uncertain federal requirements for GHG reductions, California has moved forward with statewide GHG reduction legislation. AB-32 and SB-32 establish aggressive near- and mid- term GHG reduction goals, respectively. Within the US, California is the second largest GHG emitter, accounting for approximately 7.7 percent of the national GHG emissions in 2012. Accordingly, California‚Äôs climate legislature can result in real reductions to the national GHG inventory and provide the framework for other states to achieve simultaneous economic growth and GHG reductions. California has set reduction targets based on 1990 levels of GHG emissions. The 1990 emissions limit was initially set at 427 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e), but was revised in 2014 to 431 MMTCO2e based on updated scientific reporting. In 2014, California emitted a total of 441.5 MMTCO2e, a reduction of over 1.5 million MMTCO2e since 2012. It is believed that California will continue to reduce GHG emissions and meet the 2020 target. The 2030 reduction goal of 40% below 1990 levels equates to a target emissions rate of 258.6 MMTCO2e by 2030. The long-term emission reduction goal set forth in EO S-3-05 to reach 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 equates to a target emissions rate of 86.2 MMTCO2e by 2050. = Related regulations =  Assembly Bill (AB) 197  AB-197 was signed into legislation by Governor Jerry Brown on the same day as SB-32, September 8, 2016. AB-197 is directly related to SB-32 in that AB-197 contains language stating AB-197 is only operative if SB-32 is enacted and becomes law on or before January 1, 2017. The provisions of AB-197 are intended to provide more legislative oversight of CARB by adding two new legislatively appointed non- voting members to the CARB Board, increasing the Legislature's role in the ARB Board's decisions. Additionally, AB-197 limits the term length of CARB Board members to six years. AB-197 also requires that CARB \\"protect the state's most impacted and disadvantaged communities ‚Ä¶ [and] consider the social costs of the emissions of greenhouse gases\\" in preparing plans to meet GHG reduction goals.  Executive Order B-30-15  Executive Order (EO) B-30-15 was signed by Governor Jerry Brown in April 2015 that set an executive greenhouse gas emissions target for 2030 at 40% below 1990 levels.  Executive Order S-3-05  EO S-3-05 was signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in June 2005 that set an executive greenhouse gas emissions target for 2050 at 80% below 1990 levels. While state legislation has not yet been passed regarding a 2050 statewide emissions target, this Executive Orders holds some weight. See Executive Order for more details.  Senate bill requirements  SB-32 requires CARB to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below the 1990 levels by 2030. This bill gives CARB the authority to adopt regulations in order to achieve the maximum technology feasible to be the most cost-efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They are also required to meet these goals in such a way that benefits the state‚Äôs most disadvantaged communities as they are ‚Äúdisproportionately impacted‚Äù by the effects of climate change, such as drought and flooding. SB-32 does not state how California will or should reach emission reduction targets, but rather leaves it up to CARB to adopt rules and regulations ‚Äúin an open public process‚Äù to ‚Äúachieve the maximum, technologically feasible, and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions.‚Äù Under AB-32, CARB is required to publish an Update to the Scoping Plan every five years, detailing how CARB plans to meet emission reduction targets. The Second Update to the Scoping Plan is currently being prepared, and will be published in 2017. The Second Update to the Scoping Plan is required to incorporate 2030 target year goals. = Environmental justice = Environmental justice is an important aspect of SB-32. SB-32 emphasizes the need for protecting the state‚Äôs most disadvantaged communities. The concerns brought up in the bill are that those communities are affected first and most often by the negative impacts of climate change, such as drought, heat, and flooding. SB-32 also emphasizes that disadvantaged communities are also disproportionately affected health-wise. While SB-32 does not specifically lay out a plan on how to address environmental justice issues that the authors wrote into the bill, the companion bill AB-197 does. AB-197 requires a committee to be formed and called the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies (JLCCCP), which will be responsible, among other duties, for addressing and prioritizing the disadvantaged communities in California. = Fate of Cap-and-Trade under SB-32 and AB-197 = The California Cap-and-Trade program was created by CARB as a market mechanism to reach GHG emission reduction targets established in AB-32. There currently is a Cap-and-Trade program in California, though it is not directly required under SB-32, which simply establishes a clear emissions reduction goal. In preparation of the Second Update to the Scoping Plan, CARB was presented with a study out of the University of Southern California and the University of California at Berkeley that found a tight correlation between the locations of polluting industries and of low-income communities. The environmental justice concerns associated with the cap-and-trade program could urge CARB to consider alternatives to the cap-and-trade market mechanism in the upcoming Scoping Plan. Additionally, as part of AB-197, reports of emissions inventories for GHGs, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants are required to be made public and updated at least once a year.  Criticisms  Critics of SB-32 note that CARB has too much un-checked power in regulating California, and that the legislative branch should have more involvement. However, the passage of AB-197 assuaged many of these critics. Other critics of SB-32 argue that the cap-and-trade program is actually a tax, levied without a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. See Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 for a discussion of the current legal challenges facing the cap-and-trade program. Still, further critics assert that the benefits of the CARB-favored cap-and-trade program are not shared equally by all Californians. One preliminary report asserts that polluters who can afford to are continuing to pollute, buying their way out of making actual reductions. And those polluters tend to be located in or near low-income communities that are frequently also communities of color, where their continued emissions of particulate matter and the like are degrading residents‚Äô health.

Campaign The mayoral contest was essentially a rematch from three years previously with incumbent mayor Robert Macalister opposed by councillor Frank Kitts of the Labour Party. A third candidate, Julius Hyde, stood as an independent campaigning on his opposition to the construction of an international airport in Wellington. A major talking point in the lead up to the election was the potential of a clash with the 1953 Royal Tour.

She was a member of the female version of Deschamps' nine worthies, individuals who along with their male counterparts were historical, scriptural and legendary personages who embodied the ideals of chivalry, honor and privilege. In 1591 German Lutheran theologian, pastor and historian Cyriacus Spangenberg added more detail about her and her fellow Amazons in his WeiberAdel. This work, the last part of his 921-page folio on the mythical and historical origins of the German nobility entitled Der AdelsSpiegel, is a celebration of female achievements. To that end, the work is filled with examples of women who serve as archetypes of virtues that should be imitated. Such an intuition might instill women with their own sense of virtue and thus, develop a proper sense of Lutheran piety.  WeiberAdel  In WeiberAdel several groups of Amazons are mentioned: the first of Libyan origin was described as both vicious and magnanimous and came to Europe from Africa under the direction of a Queen Myrina (after they had slaughtered all their men folk) via traversing Spain and crossing the ocean. They eventually emigrated to the lands of Sarmatia after intermarrying with the Scythian peoples who had warred with them initially, under the mistaken impression of them being men. Later, a second godly group of Amazons of Germanic stock is introduced from whom Lampetho descended. According to a story in the work that related the origins of this latter group of Amazons, the Germanic King Taurer (a descendant of the earlier King Alemann) was faced with a rising population, leading him to lead groups of people south into Hungary and down the Danube to a place near the Black Sea to resettle them. Among the group were single women and widows who were \\"wild and ardent\\" to the point that he could rely on them more than the men on the journey. As a reward for their valor, the women were given land sticking out into the water, from which they later staged war and conquered the lands of Pontus and Cappadocia. These Amazons were rendered monstrous by their rage, allowed no trespassers on their lands. Their descendants later went on to conquer all of Asia Minor. They added to the legend of the better-known Greek legend of the Amazons (each capturing a man a month for reproduction, wearing men's clothes, leaving one breast bare and burning off one nipple to improve bow usage). In this version they also made drinking vessels from the skulls of the generals they captured to offer up sacrifices to the goddess Heeres or Diana, and showed them as a civilizing force of city builders willing to go to war to free the oppressed from injustice (noted in the work as unlike many men of the time who fought only for glory, defense or conquest). Among the most prominent of the Amazon queens were Lampetho, who was in charge of internal order among the Amazons, and Marpesia, who was in charge of making war outside the borders. According to the work, around the year 1271 B.C (which in Spangenberg's chronology was some 2700 years after the creation of the world) Marpesia was reportedly attacked and defeated in a battle with famed Greek hero, and slayer of the Chimera, Bellerophon when they attempted to invade Lycia.\\"Wenn sie das Wort Ich gebraucht\\": Festschrift f√ºr Barbara Becker-Cantarino von FreundInnen, Sch√ºlerInnen und KollegInnen (Chloe) pg. 191 - 198 , References Mythology ","title":"Lampetho"},{"id":"52478667","text":"The 131st Division () was created in November 1948 under the Regulation of the Redesignations of All Organizations and Units of the Army, issued by Central Military Commission on November 1, 1948,„Ää‰∏≠Â§ÆÂÜõÂßîÂÖ≥‰∫éÁªü‰∏ÄÂÖ®ÂÜõÁªÑÁªáÂèäÈÉ®ÈòüÁï™Âè∑ÁöÑËßÑÂÆö„Äã, http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_7254c7350100xb56.html basing on the 20th Division, 7th Column of the PLA Northeastern Field Army.

Carroll has eight albums to his credit, all indie releases, beginning with 2000's South of Town. His songwriting, which focuses on life in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, is widely respected and has been compared to the work of Texas greats such as Guy Clark, John Prine and Townes Van Zandt. He was honored in 2016 with the release Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll, which features recordings of his songs by some of Austin's leading Americana music artists, including Slaid Cleaves, James McMurtry, Terri Hendrix and Tim Easton. Biography Carroll was born in 1975 in Tyler, Texas. His father is an attorney and his mother, a musician and choir director. He studied classical guitar and creative writing briefly at Tyler Junior College. He left college in his early 20s, around 1995, and began performing in the Austin- Dallas-San Antonio area, initially in coffeehouses and later at pubs and clubs throughout the region. In 1998, he released his debut South of Town which was followed by Lookin' Out the Screen Door in 2000 and Adam Carroll Live in 2002. All three were produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Lloyd Maines. While on the road, Carroll opened for some of East Texas's top musicians, who took notice of his song writing and began performing his work. Hayes Carll was the first to record a cover of one of Carroll's songs, \\"Take Me Away\\", on his 2005 album Little Rock. The song, co-written by fellow singer-songwriter John Evans, appeared on the soundtrack of the 2010 film Country Strong. Other covers followed, including Slaid Cleaves with \\"Race Car Joe\\" on Unsung in 2006 and Band of Heathens with \\"Maple of Tears\\" (co-written with band members Ed Jurdi and Gordy Quist) on their studio debut Band of Heathens in 2008. In 2005, Carroll recorded his third studio album, Far Away Blues, which was followed three years later by Old Town Rock 'n Roll. He released another live album in 2010, Live at Flipnotics, recorded at an iconic Austin coffeehouse that has since closed. In 2014, Carroll put out his fifth studio release, Let It Choose You. In April 2019, Carroll released his first solo album in five years, I Walked In Them Shoes. Then in August 2019, he and his wife singer songwriter Chris Carroll made their recording debut as a duo on Good Farmer. Chris plays mandolin and guitar on the album, while Adam plays rhythm guitar, lead guitar and harmonica. Both of the 2019 releases were produced by Lloyd Maines. Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll In 2016, fourteen Texas artists contributed interpretations of Carroll's songs to the album Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll, which was released by Eight 30 Records in late October. Participating in the homage were James McMurtry on \\"Screen Door\\", Hayes Carll on \\"Girl with the Dirty Hair\\", Slaid Cleaves on \\"South of Town\\", Band of Heathens on \\"Oklahoma Gypsy Shuffler\\", Tim Easton and Aaron Lee Tasjan on \\"Black Flag Blues\\", and Terri Hendrix on \\"Red Bandana Blues\\". Carroll himself recorded the album's 15th song, the closing track \\"My Only Good Shirt\\". The tribute reached the Americana Music Association charts and caught the attention of the regional and national music press. No Depression described the release as one of \\"the year's three or four best folk albums.\\" Referring to Carroll's talent as a songwriter, Rolling Stone remarked, \\"It speaks volumes that McMurtry and Hayes Carll and many more all contribute to (this) new homage to Adam Carroll.\\" And Elmore Magazine summed up the attraction of the album's selections: \\"Carroll's remarkable knack for creating stunning, visceral portraits of everyday Americans.\\"  Discography  *South of Town (1998) *Looking Out The Screen Door (2000) *Adam Carroll Live (2002) *Far Away Blues (2005) *Old Town Rock n Roll (2008) *Live at Flipnotics (2010) *Let It Choose You (2014) *I Walked In Them Shoes (2019) =Collaborations= *Hard Times with Michael O'Connor (2010) *Good Farmer with Chris Carroll (2019) References American folk guitarists American male guitarists American male singer-songwriters American singer- songwriters Living people Writers from Austin, Texas Musicians from Austin, Texas Songwriters from Texas 1975 births Guitarists from Texas 21st-century American singers 21st-century American guitarists 21st- century male singers ","title":"Adam Carroll (American musician)"},{"id":"52478898","text":"Tang Yao-ming (; born 29 November 1940) is a retired Taiwanese general officer.

Career When Beli Orao was completed, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had not yet been drawn into World War II. This changed with the April 1941 German-led Axis invasion of the country. At the time of the invasion, Beli Orao was located at the main Royal Yugoslav Navy fleet base at the Bay of Kotor. She was captured there by the Italians during the invasion, and was put into service with the Royal Italian Navy as Alba. She was quickly renamed Zagabria, and during her service with the Italians her two 40 mm guns were replaced by two Oerlikon L/70 guns. At the time, she was one of the largest gunboats operated by the Italians. Like other Italian gunboats, she was employed only on harbour protection and coastal escort duties. In September 1943, the Italians negotiated an armistice with the Allies, and on 7 December of that year, Beli Orao was returned by them to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile. She continued in service until the end of the war. After the war, she was renamed Biokovo and later Jadranka, serving as a Yugoslav Navy yacht and also as a presidential yacht for the President of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito. In 1969‚Äì1970 she was serving as a dispatch boat. In 1978, she was in private hands, still serving as a yacht.

She attended the Flinders University of South Australia where she finished her PhD. A fellowship was awarded to her after she completed her Doctorate with Tropical Ecosystem Research Centre from the CSIRO Division of Sustainable Ecosystems where she does research on termites. She created a system to sample termites. Early life and education Dawes-Gromadzki was born in 1972 in Adelaide, South Australia. She is the eldest of the two girls. Her mother was a school teacher while her father was a construction worker. Dawes-Gromadzki was involved in sports in her high school and received the Year 12 geography prize. Her mentor while obtain her PhD was Professor Mike Bull. Personal life Dawes-Gromadzki married Adam who she met in the Flinders University of South Australia in 1990. After marriage, they moved to Darwin, Australia.  Work  Looking at how animals and plants respond in the environment is her interest and considers herself an ecologist above anything. Specifically her job title is soil ecologist. Part of being an ecologist for Dawes-Gromadzki includes carrying out research and analyzed the importance of termites in the tropical savannas and in the southern parts of Australia. However, she has completed research on other vertebrates. Compared to other animals in the bottom of the food chain, termites do not die off in the winter and contribute to the food chain year round in Australia. She claims there are more than 350 species of termites in Australia. Her work revolves around researching the importance of termites and other creatures in keeping the soil healthy by reusing nutrients. Thus, her goal in research is learning how to replenish soil in Australia and make Australia viable. Dawes-Gromadzki's work includes increasing research on creatures that affect the soil including the following: terminates, ants, earthworms. She was author to the book Termites of Northern Australia alongside with scientists Peter Mainwaring Jacklyn, Alan Neil Andersen, and Ian Morris in 2005. The techniques for catching each organism is carried out differently by Dawes-Gromadzki. Ants are caught with jars that contain substance that attracts them and it's buried in the soil without a lid on it. Then the termites are placed in a location with minimal soil health but the termites but be kept there by providing their food and living resources. Dawes-Gromadzki is able to carry out this work through funding CSIRO and the Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre of Australia, which she work with. In 2001 she became the Research Scientist for CSIRO.

After Kozan was captured by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, the city became its capital after the capital was transferred from Anavarza sometime between 1180-1190. Almost all of the castle dates from the period of the Armenian kingdom, the main possible exceptions being a vaulted entrance corridor which could be a Mamluk-era (i.e., post 1375) construction and which carries an Arabic inscription, and, beyond this corridor and at the rear of the Armenian-constructed main entrance, a simpler gateway that may have been the original Byzantine entrance to the site.Robert W.

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \\"five-for\\" or \\"fifer\\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The Big Bash League (BBL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in Australia, which has been held annually since its first season in 2011‚Äì12. In the nine seasons played, fourteen five-wicket hauls have been taken by thirteen different bowlers. Players from seven of the eight teams have taken five-wicket hauls. The first five-wicket haul was taken by Lasith Malinga of the Melbourne Stars against the Perth Scorchers on 12 December 2012. Malinga took six wickets for seven runs, the best bowling figures in an innings by a player in the competition and one of only two six- wicket hauls. This also the most economical five-wicket haul taken with an economy rate of just 1.75 The next five-wicket haul came only 16 days later, taken by Daniel Christian of the Brisbane Heat against Sydney Thunder at ANZ Stadium in Sydney. Seasons 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15 saw no five-wicket hauls taken. The third bowler to obtain five wicket in an innings was Sydney Sixers' Nathan Lyon playing at home against the Hobart Hurricanes on 20 December 2015. Despite taking figures of 5/23, Lyon is only bowler not to be named man of the match. The fourth bowler was Samuel Badree, the second time a Brisbane Heat player has reached this milestone. Playing against the Melbourne Stars at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 January 2016, Badree took the opening five wickets of the innings from just 16 balls, finishing with figures of 5/22 off his four overs. The 2016‚Äì17 BBL season saw three five-wicket hauls taken. On 31 December 2016, Sean Abbott became the second Sydney Sixers player to achieve the feat. The Sixers lost to the Adelaide Strikers by 48 runs, the only occurrence of the seven which did not result in a victory to the team taking the five-wicket haul. Just two days later, Daniel Christian became the only player achieve the feat twice. Now with the Hobart Hurricanes, Christian finished the match with 5/14. The fifth most recent five-wicket haul was taken by Ish Sodhi of the Adelaide Strikers. Achieving the second best figures taken the competition, Sodhi took 6/14 off just 21 deliveries to become the second player to take six wickets in a BBL innings. The list includes all the five- wicket hauls taken in the BBL, and is correct as of the 2019‚Äì20 season. The list does not cover the games played by the BBL teams in other tournaments, such as the Champions League Twenty20.

Organization SiRT is headed by a civilian director, who has never been a police officer. The Director is responsible for the overall operations of the agency, and to review all investigative reports. The Director has the sole power to determine whether any charges will be laid against subject officers, unless the Director is on leave. During his absence, a specially-trained Crown Counsel is appointed as the Acting Director to decide whether charges are laid. SiRT is one of the three investigative oversight agencies for police in Canada (the other being the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba and Alberta Serious Incident Response Team) to have current sworn police officers from the Province appointed as investigators. On the other hand, the Special Investigation Unit of Ontario, the Independent Investigations Office of British Columbia, and the Bureau des enqu√™tes ind√©pendantes of Quebec prohibits serving police officers from their respective provinces from being appointed as an investigator. SiRT investigators are peace officers, and have the same powers as police officers in Nova Scotia under section 26G of the Police Act. SiRT is a member of the Canadian Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement (CACOLE).

They were founded by three sisters, Rosalie, Henriette and M√©lanie Van Biervliet in 1856. The members of the congregation use the post-nominal initials of R.S.F. after their names. History =Origins= The sisters were among the ten children born at the start of the 19th century to Pierre- Francois Van Biervliet and his wife, Marie-Jeanne, residents of Izegem in the West Flanders region of the country. Five of the children died in childhood. Both parents died shortly after one another in 1829, when their four surviving daughters‚Äîunder the leadership of their eldest sister Rosalie (1804-1893)--decided to open a boarding school in the village of Tielt in order to support themselves, which they called Coll√®ge Sainte-Marie. They were determined that the school should give the students a solid Christian formation and that they would work to serve the needs of the poor of their society. As part of their work, a small clinic was constructed in the building where, under the direction of Henriette Van Biervliet (1809-1888), free medical care was provided to the people of the region. The success of their project won such admiration by the wider society that the Bishop of Bruges, Jean-Baptist Malou, insisted that they open a normal school for girls, the first in their region, which they did in 1849. Three of the four sisters eventually felt called to carry out this commitment living as Religious Sisters. With the permission of Malou, on 3 June 1856, they professed religious vows, thereby establishing themselves as a religious congregation. The Holy Family was chosen as the patron saint of the congregation to emphasize their focus on finding God in the everyday human experience epitomized by family life. Mother Rosalie, as she was now known, was elected the first Superior General, an office in which she served until 1881. =Expansion= In 1862, soon after the founding of the congregation, it had expanded to a point that the Sisters opened another boarding school in Louvain, followed by schools in Antwerp and, in 1891, in the Helmet neighborhood of the City of Brussels. During this period, Mother M√©lanie Van Biervliet (1813-1892) was elected the second Superior General in 1881, serving for two years. Latin America A graduate of their original school in Tielt had emigrated to Guatemala, where she had begun to teach poor girls. The congregation was requested to take over this effort, to which they agreed, opening their first community in Latin America in 1896. In 1933, they were given permission by Jorge Ubico, the president of the country, to establish an international school for girls, the Colegio Belga, a noted educational institution of the nation. This permission was granted, however, on the condition that the Sisters were not to wear their religious habit. Africa In 1932, the Sisters of the Holy Family expanded their service to the colony of the Belgian Congo, when the Superior General, Mother Hyacinthe Weghsteen, agreed to fulfill the request of Bishop Edouard Louis Antoine Leys, M.Afr., head of the new Vicariate Apostolic of Kivu, for teachers. Four members of the congregation: Sisters Antoinette Brantjis, Lidwine Maeyens, Franciska Tamboren and Clara Devreese, left Brussels on 26 September of that year, traveling by train to Marseilles, from which they set sail to Africa. They arrived at their destination, the village of Kabare in the Province of Kivu (now in South Kivu) on the following 22 October. The White Fathers, who administered the local parish, had prepared a convent for their living quarters. The Sisters immediately began their study of Mashi, the local language, and began to give classes in the Catholic faith to the native women. They were later joined by Mothers Imelda and Emilienne. Construction on a school was completed two years later and the Albert I School was opened on 15 October 1934, with 19 children of the Belgian colonists boarding there and following the national curriculum of Belgium, with a separate class for native children. The Sisters' continued requests for more land for the school campus requested in an 18 hectare campus by 1959. At that point, due to the rapid political changes taking place from Belgium's sudden ending of its colonial rule, the Sisters transferred the school to the control of the school to the new Archdiocese of Bukavu. It was renamed the Lyc√©e Wima. At that point, the local community of the Sisters of the Holy Family numbered about a dozen. With the departure of the European faculty and student body, the student body became composed overwhelmingly of natives. Over the next decade, the Sisters faced a number of challenges, having to flee on two separate occasions, returning to find the school sacked by militants. By 1971, the school's future became more settled and the school had some 400 students. Current status At present, the members of the Institute of the Holy Family operates schools in Belgium, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Honduras and Rwanda. The Lay Association of the Holy Family allows lay people, both men and women, to share in the work of the institute.

Sangnosku's main female protagonist, Chae Yeongsin, was modeled after Choi Yongshin (1909‚Äì1935), a Korean teacher and activist. Another main character, Park Dong-hyeok, is based on Sim Hun's nephew Shim Jae-yeong, also an educator and activist. The plot of the novel concerns their attempts to balance romance and love with dedication to their educational mission. They agree to spend three years in the countryside before getting married, but Yongshin dies from overwork; Dong-hyeok swears to continue his efforts to promote literacy on her grave.  Development and significance  Sim Hun wrote Sangoksu in 1935 while living in Pilgyeongsa house in Dangjin, Chungcheongnam-do. It was originally serialized in 127 installments published from 10 September 1935 to 15 February 1936 in The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper. Sim Hun wrote the novel as part of an effort to promote education in the Korean countryside during the Japanese occupation of Korea. The practice of helping rural communities in Korea is known as ', and Sangoksus female protagonist has been called \\"a quintessential portrait of such colonial period enlightenment activity\\". The novel was influenced by Yi Kwang-su, a Korean writer and independence and nationalist activist, who also wrote the book's introduction. Sim Hun won the Dong-A Ilbo 15th Anniversary Full-Length Novel Contest, and used much of the prize money (KRW100, which was a significant sum at the time) to help establish Sangnok Elementary School. Sim Hun had plans to make the novel into a movie, but he died shortly after completing the novel. His plans, however, were eventually realized by others, resulting in two movies based on the novel. The novel has been made into a 1961 movie, ', by Shin Sang-ok. Another version of The Evergreen Tree movie was made by Im Kwon-taek in 1978. The novel is considered Sim Hun's most famous work. It has also been described as \\"one of the most important Korean rural enlightenment novels\\". The neighborhood of Sangnok-gu in Ansan (served by the Sangnoksu Station of Seoul Subway Line 4) is named after the novel. A Choi Yongshin Memorial Hall () is located in Sangnok-gu.

The EU-based company belongs to the early pioneers of the Semantic Web movement (Reference). The software supports enterprises in knowledge management, data analytics and content organisation. The product uses standards-based technologies as defined by W3C, which prevents vendor lock-in (Reference). Reference customers are among others Boehringer Ingelheim, Credit Suisse, European Commission, REEEP, Wolters Kluwer and the World Bank Group.  History  The PoolParty Semantic Suite is commercialising Semantic Web technologies. In 2009, the first release of the PoolParty Semantic Software entered the market. Since then, the product has evolved from a taxonomy management tool to a feature-rich semantic software platform that enables companies to deploy enterprise knowledge graphs to integrate structured and unstructured data. The product is developing fast due to a strong R&D; focus and is integral part of multiple EU research projects of the Horizon 2020 initiative ( Reference, Reference).  Product  The PoolParty Semantic Suite is a modular and flexible software package. It differentiates nine modules, which can be individually combined depending on the business challenge: * Taxonomy & Thesaurus Management * Text Mining & Entity Extraction * Ontology Management * Concept Tagging * Data Integration * Linked Data Management * Semantic Search * Recommender System * Analytics & Visualization Content assets get semantically enriched and are put into context by being matched against a knowledge graph. This is the foundation for semantic applications as search or linked data portals.  Technologies  PoolParty Semantic Suite is deploying Semantic Web technologies as promoted by W3C. The backbone of the information architecture is built by applying SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System), ontologies and Linked Data principles. Any data processed within PoolParty is transformed into RDF graphs and can be queried with SPARQL. An essential advantage of this approach is that taxonomy projects developed in PoolParty can be linked with data from virtually any repository. Companies benefit from an automatic entity linking between resources from the graph-based semantic layer and knowledge assets from data repositories like document management systems. Critics argue that the technology hasn't yet become mainstream as it is relative complex. As the demand and requirements for smarter enterprise applications are undamped, the Semantic Web technology stack becomes continuously more attractive to developers.

The barony has played an important role in Scottish history for almost five centuries. It was closely associated with the rise and fall of Stuart power in Scotland, its granting or forfeiture being used by turns to reward or punish those loyal to the House of Stuart.Oliver Thomson, 'The Rises and Falls of the Royal Stewarts', History Press: Stroud, 2009 Origins The origins of the barony lie in the twelfth century, during the turbulent period before the emergence of the Scottish Marches; there being records of a de Stobhou family as early as 1174. David de Stobhou, 1174-1206: https://www.poms.ac.uk/record/factoid/25518/ By the fourteenth century, as part of the Scottish Middle March, the barony had come into the possession of the bishopric of Glasgow. Since the creation of today‚Äôs barony in 1577, there has been a succession of thirty Barons of Stobo; the first of these being James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton,NAS.GD150.13789; GD40.1.739; RMS.IV.2727 one of the four Regents of Scotland during the minority of King James VI, later James I of England.Amy Blakeway, Regency in Sixteenth-Century Scotland (Boydell Press: Woodbridge, 2015). Morton's possession of the barony was short-lived. He was executed in 1581 for his part in the murder of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, King Consort to Mary, Queen of Scots.Alison Weir, Mary Queen of Scots and the Murder of Lord Darnley (Vintage: London, 2008). The barony was re-granted in 1587 to Sir John Maitland, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, who in 1590 became 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane,Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, vol. 5, nos. 1346, 1549. in recognition of his role in arranging the marriage of James VI to Anne of Denmark.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding: The Marriage of James VI and Anne of Denmark (John Donald: Edinburgh, 1997). Maitland is generally considered the principal architect of Stuart rule during this period.Maurice Lee junior, John Maitland of Thirlestane and the Foundation of Stewart Despotism in Scotland, (Princeton University Press, 1959). History Over the following century, ownership of the barony alternated between two competing sets of Stuart supporters: Maitland's descendants, the powerful Earls of Lauderdale,RMS.XI.50 chiefs of Clan Maitland and hereditary bearers of the National Flag of Scotland.Raymond Campbell Paterson, King Lauderdale: The Life of John Maitland, Second Earl and Only Duke of Lauderdale (John Donald: Edinburgh, 2003). and the Dukes of Lennox and Richmond,RMS.VI.1457; RMS.IX.1990 chiefs of the Clan Stewart of Darnley and favoured kinsmen of James I, Charles I and Charles II.

In the wake of the Glorious Revolution, the barony passed to another family of staunch Stuart supporters, the Murrays of Stanhope; at which point in 1697 it was erected into a free barony by Crown Charter.National Records of Scotland, C2/74 161f-162f The Murrays, wealthy baronets, were ruined by their support for the Jacobite cause, with Sir David Murray, 4th baronet, forfeiting both land and title for his role in the 1745 Rebellion, alongside many other prominent lowland Scots families.Murray Pittock, The Myth of the Jacobite Clans: The Jacobite Army in 1745 (Edinburgh University Press, 2009).

Forfeiture In 1767, Stobo was purchased out of forfeiture for ¬£40,000, along with the baronetcy of Stanhope, by James Montgomery, Lord Advocate of Scotland, later Sir James Montgomery, 1st baronet. In 1767, Montgomery also acquired a substantial and highly lucrative interest in the colonisation of Canada's Prince Edward Island;J M Bumstead, 'Sir James Montgomery and Prince Edward Island, 1767-1803', Acadiensis, 7: 76-102, 1978 an investment which funded his son, the 2nd baronet to build Stobo Castle between 1805-11 in place of an earlier fortified tower house. The barony of Stobo remained in the possession of the Graham- Montgomery family until 1905NRS SIG1/123/9; CS218/48 and then, in the possession of the Earls of Dysart until 1972.NAS.RS112.80.78Ann Matheson, 'Old Broughton, Drumelzier, Manor, Stobo and Tweedsmuir', Stenlake Publishing: Mauchline, 2014 The seat of barony and its extent The seat (‚Äúcaput‚Äù) of the barony is Stobo Castle.

Prof Andy Herries standing in the Hilary Deacon Area 1 excavations at Amanzi Springs in 2015. Amanzi Springs is a series of hydrothermal springs in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa that have yielded a series of stratified Acheulian artefacts. It is one of only two archaeological sites in Africa, along with Kalambo Falls, that has yielded wood in association with early stone age artefacts (Deacon, 1970). Amanzi Springs is located about north of Port Elizabeth and from the coast. One of the spring eyes (Area 1) was first excavated by Ray Inskeep in 1963. This excavation was then extended and deepened by Hilary Deacon in 1964‚Äì66, who also excavated at a second spring eye at the site (Area 2). These excavations establishing thick, stratified Acheulean deposits in both spring eyes, something extremely rare in southern African contexts. The archaeology from these spring eyes are considered to represent late occurrences of the Acheulian, or perhaps even a rare occurrence in South Africa of Sangoan artefacts (Herries, 2011). Despite this fact the site has not been investigated in 50 years. In 2015 a joint research project involving La Trobe University, the University of Johannesburg, and University of Cape Town began at the site and has noted the first occurrence of Middle Stone Age artefacts at the site (Figure 3). 2\\\\.

Life and career  Clara Bohn was born in Stechow, Havelland. After attending the village school in Stechow, she graduated from a commercial school in Berlin. She then worked as a typist and secretary, later as head secretary and finally, until her marriage to Willy Schuch in 1906, as a business correspondent. Active as a writer in the AWO (Workers' Welfare Association), she wrote poems and essays and spoke at conferences and meetings. One of her special concerns was the fight against the high infant mortality in Germany; She called for the establishment of maternity counselling centers. She participated in committees for the protection of children and, together with Emil Wutzky, made possible the opening of the first Berlin home for working youth. During the First World War, her most important concern was again the social care of children. From 1919 to 1922 she was editor of the SPD women's magazine Die Gleichheit (\\"Equality\\").  Parliamentary representative  From 1919 to 1920, Clara Bohm-Schuch was a member of the Weimar National Assembly and of the parliamentary Investigatory Committee for the Question of Responsibility for the World War (Untersuchungsausschuss f√ºr die Schuldfragen des Weltkrieges). She was subsequently a member of the Reichstag until 1933. In parliament she fought especially for the protection of mothers and children. During the last SPD caucus meeting before the passing of the Enabling Act, the parliamentary representative and Reichsbanner chief Karl H√∂ltermann argued against taking part in the vote because he had been warned by members of the Centre Party that in such a case, the SA would not permit SDP deputies to leave the Kroll Opera House alive. Together with Louise Schroeder, Bohm-Schuch spoke vehemently against this proposed absenteeism.  Nazi era  Following the Nazi seizure of power, in August 1933 she was detained in the Barnimstra√üe Women's Prison. Although she was in prison only for 15 days, she was psychologically destroyed as a consequence of this imprisonment and after her release was required to report regularly to the police. Clara Bohm-Schuch died in Berlin on 6 May 1936 and was buried on 12 May 1936 on the Baumschulenweg Cemetery on Kiefholzstrasse in Baumschulenweg. Five thousand people attended her funeral, an act which was regarded as a silent protest against the Nazi regime.  Memorials  Memorial plaque at the Reichstag In 1966, the street Bohm-Schuch-Weg in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln was named for her. Since 1992, Bohm- Schuch's name appears on one of the 96 plaques in the Memorial to the Murdered Members of the Reichstag, on the corner of Scheidemannstra√üe / Republic Square in Berlin near the Reichstag building.

Automated grid generation  Automated grid generation is one of the great advantages of OpenLB over other CFD software packages. The main advantages are listed below: * Use of geometries in the STL file format or geometrically primitive forms (e.g. ball, cylinder, cone) and their union, intersection and difference * Very fast voxelization: 6003 ~ 1 minute * Handling non-watertight surfaces * Memory-friendly using octrees * Load distribution for parallel execution with MPI and OpenMP. The automatic grid generation can assume both an STL file as well as primitive geometries. For the geometry, a uniform and rectangular grid is created which encloses the entire space of the geometry. The superfluous grid cells are then removed and the remaining cuboids are shrunk to fit the given geometry. Finally, the grid is distributed to different threads or processors for the parallel execution of the simulation. The boundary conditions and start values can be set using material numbers.

He was consecrated a bishop in secret and spent most of his years as bishop in prison. His death was likely due to poisoning by officials of the USSR. Pope Francis approved his beatification on 1 December 2016 and it was celebrated in Vilnius at the cathedral square on 25 June 2017. Life Teofilius Matulionis was born on 22 June 1873 in Molƒótai, a town then in the Russian Empire, now in Lithuania. He was the second of three children to Jurgis Matulionis (1833‚Äì1911) and Ona Juoƒçepytƒó (1851-9 May 1877); his two brothers were Jonas (1871‚Äì1920) and Juozas (1875‚Äì1955). After his mother died, his father remarried, and he and his second wife had seven children. Matulionis studied at Antalieptƒóje from 1887 to 1892 and then at Daugpilis from 1892 to 1900. He graduated from high school in Latvia and began his theological studies for the priesthood in Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he was ordained on 17 March 1900. He interrupted his studies for a brief period to reconsider his vocation. He studied Russian, Latvian and Polish. He also served briefly as a curate in several Latvian parishes. He was assigned to a small parish in Latgalia, Latvia, beginning on 26 June 1900 and transferred in 1910 to the parish of the Immaculate Heart of Jesus in Saint Petersburg, where Catholicism was a minority religion. He led a campaign to the construct a new parish church, and he was awarded the title Monsignor. He lived in Saint Petersburg until 1929. Matulionis after returning from a Soviet prison in 1933 Pope Pius XI named him an auxiliary bishop of Mohilev, Belarus, on 8 December 1928 and Matulionis received his episcopal consecration in secret on 7 February 1929 from Bishop Anton Malecki. His pastoral work was often hampered by the communist government. In 1922 the Bolsheviks ordered the confiscation of all churches. Their decree required pastors to provide their signatures. Matulionis refused and was arrested and imprisoned from 1923 until 1925, as part of the broader persecution centered on the \\"show trial\\" of Bishop Jan Cieplak. He was arrested a second time and sentenced to a decade of hard labor in the Arctic where the cold and damp climate damaged his health. He often awoke in the middle of the night to celebrate the Mass in secret using everyday bread as the Eucharist and distributing it in secret to fellow inmates when he could. The authorities relocated him to a prison in Saint Petersburg because of his health. He was placed in solitary confinement, but released in 1933 as part of a prisoner exchange when the Lithuanian government signed an accord with the Soviet Union for a ten-prisoner exchange, though he asked not to be part of the exchange. From 1934 until 1936 he lived in the United States. He also visited Cairo and Jerusalem, and parts of Western Europe. In 1934 he met Pius XI in a private audience and the pope said to him: \\"It is an honor to the Lithuanian nation to have such a hero\\". In 1943, during World War II, Pope Pius XII made him bishop of Kai≈°iadorys, Lithuania. He was arrested a third time for releasing a pastoral letter in 1946 and was sentenced to another decade in prison. Upon his release in 1956, he was forbidden to exercise his role as bishop and held under house arrest in Bir≈°tonas. On 25 December 1957, he consecrated Vincentas Sladkeviƒçius a bishop without the consent of the communists. They ridiculed Matulionis for performing the ceremony in a small kitchen. He said they should be ashamed of forcing him to act in secret. For acting without government consent he was exiled to Seduva where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1962 Pope John XXIII, on the 33rd anniversary of his consecration as bishop, gave him the personal title of archbishop. Matulionis died on 20 August 1962 not long after a routine USSR KGB check of his apartment during which he was drugged. He had previously been denied permission to attend the Second Vatican Council. The government allowed his remains to be interred in his diocesan cathedral on condition that no demonstrations occur. His remains were exhumed in 1999 and tests confirmed that he had been poisoned. =Posthumous honors= In 2003 he was granted the Life Saving Cross and in 2006 awarded the Cross of the Order of the Grand Cross for his heroism and sacrifices. Beatification The beatification process began under Pope John Paul II on 2 April 1990 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (CCS) titled him a Servant of God. The diocesan process lasted until 1 May 2008. Pope Francis confirmed on 1 December 2016 that Matulionis had died \\"in odium fidei\\" (due to hatred of the faith) and approved the beatification. Cardinal Angelo Amato, Prefect of the CSS, presided at the beatification ceremony on 25 June 2017 in Vilnius. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Mindaugas Sabonis.

Denmark created a multipillar system, consisting of an unfunded social pension scheme, occupational pensions, and voluntary personal pension plans. Denmark's system is a close resemblance to that encouraged by the World Bank in 1994, emphasizing the international importance of establishing multifaceted pension systems based on public old-age benefit plans to cover the basic needs of the elderly. The Danish system employed a flat-rate benefit (social security benefit) funded by the government budget and available to all Danish residents. The employment-based contribution plans are negotiated between employers and employees at the individual firm or profession level, and cover individuals by labor market systems. These plans have emerged as a result of the centralized wage agreements and company policies guaranteeing minimum rates of interest. The last pillar of the Danish pension system is income derived from tax-subsidized personal pension plans, established with life insurance companies and banks. Personal pensions are inspired by tax considerations, desirable to people not covered by the occupational scheme. Also included in the Danish pension system are statutory supplementary pensions. These cover a significant portion of the population, sometimes much more than just the workforce. Supplementary pensions are institutionally and by ways of funding similar to the occupational system.  Public pensions  = Universal social pensions = In Denmark, the public pension consists of two tiers. The first tier provides a universal income to people over the age of 65. This pension is paid to anyone that meets its qualifications, regardless of a retiree's contributions. As of 2019, the maximum amount a person could receive was DKK 75.924 (US$11.504). However, it is means-tested, so it can be adjusted for lower income individuals up to a maximum of DKK 159.000 (US$ 24.091). Normally, the pension is reduced by 30 percent of any income that exceeds DKK 329.600.N√•r du f√•r folkepension, Borger.dk, To receive this pension, recipients must have had lived in Denmark for 40 years while they were between the ages between 15 and 65. If a resident has spent less the 40 years in Denmark, then he or she can still receive the pension, just at a proportionately reduced rate. Funding for this pension isn‚Äôt base on contributions, rather funds are secured from general tax revenue collected by the state. The Social Disability Pension program is financed by general tax revenues dependent on social and medical factors and is historically known as a standard disability pension program. The SDP evaluates the medical and social criteria on three levels, the first granting eligibility to individuals younger than 60 with minimal work capacity. The next level is for people younger than 60 who have the work capacity equivalent to one third of normal, along with individuals between 60 and 66 years of age with hardly any ability to work. Lastly, the ordinary SDP level is granted to individuals with the work capacity below half of normal, based upon social and/or health criteria. All pensioners receive a minimum of 40 percent of their average earnings, and receive additional support through easily accessible universal healthcare and housing benefits. = Occupational pensions = Occupational Pensions are another type of pension, covering nearly 90 percent of the Danish workforce. These schemes are mandated by collective bargaining agreements made between employers and employees, usually at the sectoral level. Company wide plans do exist, but they are not as common as sector wide pensions. Payouts made by these types of schemes are also determined by the contributions made by employees and employers. Typically, employee contributions range from 9 to 17 percent of their salary, with the average amount being 11 percent. Generally, high wage earners contribute a higher percentage of their income to their pension than low wager earners. It is typical for the employer to contribute two thirds and the employee one third in the occupational pension system. Workers covered by different collective labor agreements are subject to mandatory participation, with varying contribution rates. Most plans depend on defined-contribution schemes, often including death and disability benefits. In 1998, the labor force was recorded to have contributed about 4% of their gross salary to pensions, and in 2002, 77% of the labor force contributed over 7%, exemplifying a steady growth in the average contribution rate. Depending on the plan, payouts can be collected in the form of phased withdrawals, lump sums, or life annuities.  Personal and supplementary pensions  = Personal pensions = Personal pensions cover additional private saving. Danish subsidized personal pension plans are extensive, often similar to occupational pension plans; however participation is voluntary and plans are financed by participants. Because contributions occur by means of collective labor agreements, they are classified as quasimandatory, as most workers are covered. These individual pension savings agreements between the individual and the institution stipulate the policy holder's entitlement to benefits after a specified age. Personal pensions are partial tax exemptions and have payouts similar to public pensions in that they can be collected by means of phased withdrawals, lump sums, or life annuities. = Labor Market Supplementary Pension Fund = The largest of the supplementary pension schemes is the Labor Market Supplementary Pension Fund, Arbejdsmarkedets Tillaegspension, or ATP. This pension's payout is determined by the contributions made by the individual. The more years a person works, and the longer retirement is delayed, the more money a retiree will receive. Contributions to ATP are mandatory for employees aged 16 to 65 who work more than 9 hours a week. Employers are also required to make payments. The required contributions are set by a fixed sum. As of 2014, for a full-time employee, the required payment was DKK 3240 a year. An employer is responsible for two-thirds of the payment while the employee makes the other third. If a person is less than a full-time employee, the contribution is reduced accordingly. Like the universal pension, the retirement age is 65. However, starting 2024, it will be increase by six months every year until it reaches 67. = Employees' Capital Pension Fund = Employees‚Äô Capital Pension Fund (in Danish, the L√∏nmodtagernes Dyrtidsfond or LD) was established in 1978 and was aimed at being an economic policy measure. When wages were adjusted upwards several times in the late 1970s, the Danish government decided only one price adjustment would be allowed annually, leaving the rest frozen and held in LD personal accounts until retirement. This attempt to contain inflationary practice led to the allowance of investing assets in mutual funds. In June 2005, the LD increased the total net asset under management in a month by investing all assets in mutual funds, a total of 12 percent. = Special Pension Savings = Introduced in 1998 as a fiscal policy tool to slow consumer spending while increasing pension saving by requiring all wage earners to contribute one percent of their gross salary, the Special Pension Savings program (SP) is Denmark's second largest supplementary pension scheme behind the ATP. Until suspension in 2003, SP benefits depended on investment returns and the size of the contribution. Suspension can be examined as a result of reduced incentives to engage, as households are not always fully rational, finding value in the optimization of employer contributions instead.  Challenges  Pension policy in Denmark during the 1980s and 1990s was defined by pension funds and insurance companies guaranteeing a minimum interest rate for new pension policies. Compared to the high nominal rates that were common at the time, the guaranteed rates were low and were given to policyholders free of charge. Pension institutions invested in callable mortgage bonds that allowed borrowers to refinance their mortgages when interest rates fell, creating an asymmetric interest risk rate and encompassing a significant portion of the Danish financial system. When equity markets collapsed and the new millennium global interest rates diminished, pension contracts and institutions were subject to liabilities, drained capital reserves, and mismatched assets. This led to market-to-market valuation of the balance sheet and supervisory requirements to focus on the ability to withstand economic stress. Pension systems in advanced capitalist economies are influenced significantly by labor market deregulation, unionization, deindustrialization, the rise of the service sector, and trends toward welfare state entrenchment. Denmark's deep integration in the world economy introduces risk as global financial conditions would impact household debt and consumption. Decommodification is influenced heavily by pensions because of the link created between retirement income and labor market attachment. Although the Nordic pension system combines generous social protections and labor market flexibility, polarization between workers and the unemployed widens inequality and in the case of occupational pensions, shifts risk to employees. To reduce labor supply of older workers while consequently lessening youth unemployment, early retirement would allow individuals who have paid contributions for up to thirty years go on early retirement at 60 until they qualify for old age pension at 65.

Family He was descended from the house of Wittelsbach. His parents were Otto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach (son of Rupert, King of Germany and younger brother of Louis III) and his wife Joanna of Bavaria-Landshut (eldest daughter of Henry XVI, Duke of Bavaria). Albert's brother Rupert became bishop of Regensburg, whilst his other brother John became a canon and went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Life Albert initially served as a canon in the chapter of Strasbourg Cathedral, then as its provost. He was a cousin of his predecessor as bishop Rupert of Palatinate-Simmern but pursued a less confrontational policy than Rupert, making Strasbourg a more uniformly managed territory with clearer, securer borders, fortifying towns and cities and buying back territories. To pay off the high cost of getting his election confirmed by the pope, he put a tax on eating butter during Lent, which was also partly used to fund the casting of cannon - the tax caused some resentment among his prince-bishopric's population but this and other measures improved its financial position. The Bundschuh movement coincided with this term as bishop and in 1502 he warned his officers, the Unterlandvogt in Alsace and other cities about the movement's resurgence. He wished to set up a common defence network for the cities and rural areas within the prince-bishopric and he put in place surveillance measures. At a meeting in Schlettstadt he also established an alliance.Claudia Ulbrich: Der Untergrombacher Bundschuh 1502. In: Peter Blickle, Thomas Adam (Hrsg.): Bundschuh. Untergrombach 1502, das unruhige Reich und die Revolutionierbarkeit Europas. Stuttgart, 2004 S. 32‚Äì34 His relationship with the cathedral chapter was generally good and he involved himself in reform in the diocese, particularly fighting abuses in its monasteries, to which end he convened a diocesan synod in 1482 and carried out visitations in 1492. However, he did not oppose papal indulgences. He was strongly influenced by Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg, who was a preacher at Strasbourg Cathedral from 1478 and urged Albert to reform the church, and by Jakob Wimpfeling, who lived in Strasbourg from 1501 onwards. In 1506 Albert defended Wimpfeling against pope Julius II, but Albert and Geiler's joint hopes of reform foundered - for example, their plan to dissolve the discredited order of St Stefan (a group of penitential canons) and replace it with a community of clergy failed after a visitation of it had to be abandoned due to the cathedral chapter's opposition.Francis Rapp: Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johannes (1445‚Äì1510) In: Theologische Realenzyklop√§die, Teil I Band 12 Berlin, 1984 S. 161 In 1493 he built an aisle alongside the main nave of the church of Notre-Dame-de-la-Nativit√© in Saverne as his burial chapel - his gravestone still survives and the aisle has become a chapel dedicated to the Mother of God, but the aisle's tombs were desecrated and destroyed during secularization during the French Revolutionary era.

Mager was born in Eichst√§tt in Bavaria, in 1880. An idealist by nature, he worked as a schoolteacher and organist to fund his research into electronic instruments. In 1911, after hearing an organ that had become slightly detuned due to temperature variations, Mager began researching quarter tones, and built a harmonium based on quarter-tonal divisions. This became the basis for many of his later instruments. In the 1920s, Mager developed the Electrophon (later renamed to the Spharophon), a keyboard instrument that produced sound using heterodyning. Its premiere at the 1926 Donaueschingen Festival was well received by the attendees, including Paul Hindemith and Alois H√°ba. In the late 1920s Mager received a government grant, and used this money to found a laboratory near Darmstadt; he also began an Electronic Music Society at around the same time. At his laboratory Mager designed and constructed an organ which he used alongside a huge array of amplifiers, aluminium pots, glass plates, oven pipes and the wooden frame of a cello which used a frying pan as an additional amplifier. All of these were linked to the organ by wires to produce the 'tonal colours' Mager experimented with.PIX Magazine, Vol. 3 No. 2 (14 January 1939) Mager was among the first musicians to begin serious discussion of electronic music, with his 1924 essay Eine neue Epoche der Musik durch Radio (\\"A New Epoch in Music through Radio\\"). Although he created a number of unique electronic instruments, including the Kurbelspharophon and the Kaleidophon, all of his examples were destroyed by Allied bombing raids during World War II.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. It is the only school from its time still extant in Plymouth, and the only school in Plymouth designed by Malcomson and Higginbotham, who designed numerous schools for the Detroit school district. History Until the 1920s, the Plymouth school district had relied on a single, centrally located school to service its student population. The first school, a log structure, was built in 1830. This was replaced with a frame structure in 1840 and a larger brick school in 1884, which housed both elementary and high school students. This school burned in 1916, and was replaced with a large building. However, by 1922, the district had grown to nearly 1000 students, and even the 1916 school was severely overcrowded. An elementary school was added that year, located near the main school. By 1926, even this school was overcrowded, and the school board decided to construct a neighborhood elementary school in the North Village section of the city. The school board hired the firm of Malcomson and Higginbotham to design this school, which was constructed by contractors Talbot & Meier. It was named for George Anson Starkweather, one of the pioneers of Plymouth and a former teacher in the district. The school opened in 1927. It was used as a neighborhood school for several decades, and a gymnasium and cafeteria addition was constructed at the rear in 1961. The school later was converted into an adult education center. It closed in 2013. The district sold the building in early 2016, and developers have plans to renovate the structure into 22 loft spaces, to be called \\"Schoolhouse Lofts of Plymouth\\". Description Starkweather School is a two-story I-plan structure, faced with red/brown brick with limestone trim, and topped with a high hipped roof. The front facade is symmetrical, with each end featuring prominent bay windows surrounded with limestone and topped with a parapet containing inset brick squares. Hipped roof sections project forward over the bays. Two entryways with arched limestone surrounds are located inboard of the bay windows. The roof was originally clad with slate, but now has asphalt shingles. A pair of limestone-trimmed red brick chimneys sit atop the roof, complementing the facade. The front facade originally has banks of five tall side-by-side double-hung nine-over-nine windows. One bank was located in each of the two center bays and one more in each bay window in the bay above each. The bay windows had metal spandrel panels with raised center panels between the center bays‚Äô upper and lower tiers. The side and rear facades also had more of these windows, with surrounds that matched those in the front facade. However, the original windows have been replaced with much smaller vinyl windows set into insulated panels that infill the original openings, and dramatically change the look of the building. Two additions are connected to the main structure. The first is a single-story flat-roof red brick garage connected at the northeast rear corner. The second is a modern hipped roof, red brick gymnasium and cafeteria addition, connected at the southeast rear corner. The gymnasium addition has a windowless red brick base with clerestory windows above, now also replaced with smaller vinyl windows. On the interior, the building is substantially original. The two entry vestibules have quarry tile floors and brick walls with decorative tiles, manufactured by the Flint Faience Tile Company inset. The corridors floors feature rust-colored sheet linoleum inset into a cream-colored terrazzo bases and with coved border. Corridor walls have a cement wainscoting topped with oak trim. The classroom floors are carpeted, with original wood floors beneath. Each classroom has a blackboard surrounded by stained oak trim, and coat and storage areas on another wall, with bulletin boards either side. The kindergarten room has, in addition, a fireplace surrounded with Flint Faience tile in a field of green, and an oak mantel. The same green Flint Faience tiles surround a drinking fountain.

","title":"Graphotype (disambiguation)"},{"id":"52480700","text":"Graphotype was a brand name used by the Addressograph-Multigraph Company for its range of metal plate embossing machines. The machines were originally used to create address plates for the Addressograph system and mark military style identity tags and other industrial nameplates. The machines came in a number of variants with sliding, hand wheel or keyboard selected letters. The keyboard models and some rotary select units were motorised to allow faster operation. The machines used in making Addressograph plates would deboss (stamp into the plate) the letters into the plate resulting in a well defined printing surface resembling the typewriter fonts of the day on the reverse side that would be used to transfer the details (usually customer addresses) onto envelopes or form letters. The same style was used in the early 1940s to 1980s for the US military identification tags and the tag details could be transferred onto medical charts using a hand held imprinter in field hospital conditions. These same machines also found use in marking other nameplates and rating plates in industry and for this an embossed (raised letters in the style found on contemporary credit cards) marking style was preferred for ease of reading and maintaining a flat surface on the back of the plate. Military tags moved over to this style when the imprinting use was deprecated in the late 1960s and new machines would only be supplied as embossing units as the address plate market had been taken over by the computer revolution. In the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington DC the graphotype machine is mistakenly named a 'qraphotype machine'.

The platform is based on a combined in-memory database engine and application server.  Technology  355x355px A combined in-memory database engine and application server keeps data in one place. This technology is called \\"virtual machine database management system\\", or VMDBMS. The patent related to the technology explains it this way: > In such a system, the environment is configured to maintain a database of > objects in a database memory within the environment memory. An application > executes in an application memory within the environment memory, and upon > instantiation of a database object, the application environment allocates > memory in the database for the database object, the database providing > master storage for the database object. Tables and classes are the same as a consequence of the VMDBMS which lets the application and database be in the same virtual memory space. The implication of this is that there is no object-relational mapper (ORM). Instead, the database is directly accessed using SQL-like queries called NewSQL from the application code. A major drawback with in-memory databases is that main memory is volatile and does therefore not ensure durability. The solution to this, which Starcounter utilizes, is to write transaction logs to a disk the same way it's done in traditional SQL databases. If data needs to be recovered, it's possible to do so by going back in the transaction logs. The database maintains ACID compliance by using transactional scope and transactional memory which allows for long-running transactions, nested transactions, and parallel transactions. Starcounter uses a Model-View- ViewModel (MVVM) pattern where the view model is hosted on the server. The server-side code is written using C# since the platform is making use of the .NET framework. The communication between the client and the server is done using a thin client library that sends JSON-patches. The recommended way to build the view in Starcounter applications is to use HTML, CSS, Polymer, and Web Components, with as little logic as possible on the client side.  Similar Software  Starcounter can be likened by Oracle's TimesTen in-memory database and SAP HANA. What these have in common is that they are all based on in-memory technology and are often targeted towards customers that use real- time applications. The main difference is the way the database management system is integrated. SAP HANA makes use of a column-oriented database management system. TimesTen, on the other hand, uses a relational database management system (RDBMS). Starcounter is unique in that it uses an object- oriented approach that is integrated with the application (VMDBMS) with an underlying RDMBS .  History  Starcounter AB was established and started its development of Starcounter in 2006. It received $1.8 million in funding from a VC round led by Industrifonden in 2015 to continue the development. The Starcounter 2.0 beta version, which bundles a web application framework with the database, was released in August 2013. Starcounter AB was named a \\"Cool Vendor\\" in In-Memory Computing Technologies for 2015 by Gartner. In September 2017, Starcounter AB took in 35 million SEK in funding from existing investors and an anonymous investor. Also in September 2017, Starcounter AB won a 2.2 million Euro prize in the competition \\"SME Instrument - Open Disruptive Innovation Scheme\\" organized by Horizon 2020.

They were originally located at 83 Vanguard Way, Shoeburyness before opening a further site at Fairfax Drive, Southend-on-Sea. During the 1990s SENTRA started using the trading name Prospects Training and moved into further training areas including Construction. During the 00s Prospects purchased the Pegasus Training Centre in Basildon, and changed the company name to Prospects Learning Foundation, trading as Prospects College. They then initially took over as trustees of Thorpe Bay School in Southend in 2006, moving its Southend centre to this location in 2010 and rebranding it Futures Community College. In 2007 they moved into new premises in Crompton Close, Basildon. In 2012 a new ¬£10m centre in Basildon was opened next door to the existing Basildon centre. This was followed by a further centre on Canvey Island in 2013. In 2015 Prospects College become the first new incorporated FE college in 20 years and was rebranded PROCAT.

The oldest items of church furniture are the 1495 pulpit (with stone marks by Hans Hammer, master mason at Strasbourg Cathedral) and a carved wooden sculpture of the Virgin and Child from the same era, probably by Nikolaus Hagenauer. The choir has a 16th-century crucifix, a 15th-century pieta and part of a limewood sculpture of the Assumption, probably from a 1486 altarpiece. The windows in the main nave were almost completely destroyed by a bombing raid on the night of 30‚Äì31 July 1918.

St. Peter pap. 32Denke (2010:53) Life Gr√ºnenberg was perhaps born around 1415 or earlier, as the son of the mayor of Constance. He is first mentioned in 1441 as a judge and church architect. By 1465, he had been in the service of Emperor Frederick III for some time, and at the latest 1486 on held the rank of Ritter.Denke (2010:92) In Jerusalem, he was probably made a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre. He was furthermore a member of the Aragonese Order of the Jar and of the Austrian Order of Saint George. =Holy Land pilgrimage (1486)= His pilgrimage to the Holy Land lasted 33 weeks, from April to early December 1486. Starting out in Constance on 22 April, he travelled to Venice via Rheineck, Sterzing in Tyrol and Trento, and (31 May) from Venice by galley via Poreƒç in Istria, Dalmatia (Zadar, ≈†ibenik, Lesina, Korƒçula and Ragusa) to Corfu, Modon in Morea, then on to Candia on Crete, Rhodes, and Cyprus (Limassol, Galini, Famagusta), arriving in Jaffa on 24 July. Travelling by donkey, he visited Lydda, Ramla, Emmaus (i.e. Imwas), Jerusalem and Bethlehem. On 1 September he took a ship back from Jaffa, reaching Venice on 16 November (Saint Othmar's day), returning home in early December.Denke (2010:466) The two original illustrated manuscripts describing the pilgrimage were already completed in 1487 and are considered to be autograph. The slightly older one is being kept at the Baden State Library in Karlsruhe as Cod. St. Peter pap. 32; and the next and more detailed one is being kept at the Gotha Research Center of the University of Erfurt. Both codices contain coloured drawings, and while some of the drawings in the Karlsruhe codex seem to be made by Gr√ºnenberg himself, the Gotha codex is illustrated with larger drawings that combine features of the Karlsruhe drawings with features borrowed from Erhard Reuwich's work, originating from Reuwich's own 1483-4 pilgrimage. The Karlsruhe codex has been interpreted as Gr√ºnenberg's own private copy, with the Gotha codex, which contains a more elaborate text and more detailed drawings, interpreted as a presentation copy dedicated to some important personality.Denke (2010:59-60) References Revised and facsimile editions *Stillfried-Alcantara, Hildebrandt, Des Conrad Gr√ºnenberg, Ritters und Burgers zu Costenz, Wappenbuch.

A French frigate captured her in 1813, but then abandoned her. After her recovery she returned to trade. She was wrecked in 1821 at Inaccessible Island in a notable incident. Career Blenden Hall first appears in Lloyd's Register in 1811 with J. Farrier, master.Lloyd's register (1811), Supplement, Seq.‚ÑñB69.] In 1813 her master changed from Farrier to J. Barr. Her owner changed from Andersen to Shedden.Lloyd's Register (1813), Seq.‚Ññ 332. On 27 November 1813 Blenden Hall, bound for Bermuda with naval stores, and four other merchant vessels, left Portsmouth in a convoy under escort by . Due to a heavy storm, the five merchantmen lost contact with the convoy and its escort. On 5 December the French frigate Clorinde captured all five merchant vessels, in the Atlantic Ocean (). The French took off the crews of four vessels and scuttled three. They kept Lusitania as a cartel and put all their captives aboard her. In their haste, they failed to sink Blenden Hall. They then permitted Lusitania to sail to a British port. On 12 December the Falmouth packet Eliza, homebound to England from Malta, found Blenden Hall drifting. Eliza put a 10-man prize crew aboard and both set off for Falmouth. Bad weather intervened and the two separated. On 16 December came on the scene and under a dubious pretext put her own prize crew aboard Blenden Hall as well. On 18 December brought Blenden Hall into Plymouth. There, Blenden Hall was reunited with her crew, which had arrived that same day.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4831. Challenger sued for salvage on Blenden Hall, but the Admiralty Court pointed out that Elizas crew had not required Challengers help and dismissed the case. Barr resumed his voyage.

She had 24 crew and 28 passengers, including five women and three children. On the way Blendan Hall encountered the merchant ship , which was on her way to Madras. The weather being dead calm, Greig spent a day on Daphne and had a \\"Most excellent dinner\\". Blendan Hall was reported to have been at Cape Verde on 8 June. As of 1 December she had not arrived at Bombay and there had been no further word of her. The reason for the lack of news was that on 22 July the weather was foggy and Blenden Hall had drifted on to the rocks at Inaccessible Island. Two seamen drowned trying to swim to shore. However all the rest of the crew and passengers on Blenden Hall made it to shore safely. Once there, they were marooned for four months. They subsisted on birds, birds' eggs, and seal meat. On 19 October six men sailed for Tristan da Cunha on a boat or raft that the survivors had constructed; this party was never heard from again. The survivors constructed a second boat that with three men aboard reached Tristan da Cunha on 8 November. Two boats set out from the island and rescued the remainder of the survivors.

The three-part series was first broadcast on ITV on 7 December 2016. The series is distributed worldwide by BBC Worldwide. Plot The plot revolves around serial killer Peter Manuel, who killed at least eight people between 1956 and 1958 in Lanarkshire, and the detective who pursued him to his conviction, William Muncie. Manuel, who was born in the United States, was known as \\"The Beast of Birkenshaw\\" (as he lived in Birkenshaw, Uddingston). He taunted his pursuer with messages and even sent him birthday and Christmas cards. At the time, local police had never dealt with this level of criminality before; Manuel chose his victims at random, with no apparent reason and ended up scaring a whole community so much that everyone started locking their doors. The series follows the destructive trail that Manuel left and shows him reveling in his cockiness with the police and his victims, even going so far as representing himself in his criminal trials. Cast *Douglas Henshall as William Muncie *Martin Compston as Peter Manuel *James Harkness as Joe Brannan * Sorcha Groundsell as Jane Muncie *Shauna Macdonald as Agnes Muncie * Kate McLaughlin as Sandra Muncie * Joanne Thomson as Iris Laird * Gavin Jon Wright as Hugh Kirk * Jack Greenlees as DS McLeod * Jenny Hulse as Mary McLauchlan * Lousie McCarthy as Babs * Stewart Porter as John Buchanan * Gilly Gilchrist as Sammy Manuel * Joanna Roth as Bridget Manuel * Bobby Rainsbury as Theresa Manuel * Michael Nardone as Det Supt Leish *Gary Lewis as William Watt Research Both Compston and Henshall spent time researching their parts and the characters they would be playing. Compston admitted to being scared stiff in one scene and said that he had driven around to Manuel's old house after filming and parked up, \\"just to sit outside\\". Henshall talked about his part with William Muncie's daughter and was determined to bring the character to life, who, by Henshall's estimation, was single-minded in catching Manuel but also the only one who took to the notion of him being a serial killer. The production caused controversy amongst the relatives of some of the victims. The production team tried to contact everyone, but Stuart and David Reid, whose two aunts, Marianne Watt and Margaret Brown and cousin, Vivienne (daughter of Marianne Watt) were killed by Manuel in 1956, could not be found. The brothers have said that the production would re-open old wounds. They contacted the production team who listened to their comments, but the brothers claim it was to no avail; ‚ÄúWe asked ITV to scrap it. The producers did listen to what we had to say but by this point it was too little, too late. It was obvious they had no intention of pulling the plug.‚Äù Production Many locations across Glasgow (including the Victoria Infirmary) and the Central Belt of Scotland were used in filming. Some parts were even filmed in Compston's home town of Greenock. Dunlop in East Ayrshire was also used for the home of the detective Muncie and the police station (outside entrance). Albion Automotive disused office in Scotstoun was used for scenes in the inside of the police station. Culture Secretary, Fiona Hyslop, confirmed that the Scottish Government would be contributing ¬£250,000 towards the production. She announced this on the opening day at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in June 2016.

The direct-to-video film stars Scott Adkins, Wade Barrett, Daniel Caltagirone and James Cosmo. Eliminators was produced and released by WWE Studios. Adkins plays a former U.S. Federal agent in witness protection, being tracked by a deadly contract killer played by Bennett (perhaps better known as WWE wrestler Wade Barrett). Plot Former U.S. federal agent Thomas McKenzie, now using the name Martin Parker, is living in London under witness protection with his eight-year-old daughter, Carly. Thomas had worked undercover inside the crime syndicate of American arms dealer Charles Cooper, where he fell in love and married Cooper's daughter. Thomas' wife has since died, and Cooper wants to kill him and get his grand daughter. One night, three armed burglars with the wrong address break into their London home looking for cocaine. After a brutal fight, and with a gun pointed at Thomas and a knife to Carly's neck, Thomas takes the gun and kills the burglars. He calls U.S. Embassy colleague Gail Callister before passing out due to a head wound. Thomas wakes handcuffed in his hospital bed, charged with murder and with his face all over the news. Carly has been taken to Kavendish Place, Child Social Services, where she is placed in the care of Stacy. Cooper, having finally found him, sends deadly British hitman George \\"Bishop\\" Edwards to kill Thomas and bring him Carly. Thomas' old friend, Ray Monroe, calls to explain that he is on a flight from the U.S. and will arrive in two hours to sort out the witness protection status with the British authorities, as Callister and the U.S. Embassy has proven incapable of handling the situation. Worried about Carly, Thomas engages in a brutal fight with three policemen and escapes from the hospital. He finds Bishop trying to hack a database at Kavendish Place, and believes he is a child care worker. Bishop attacks him, but Thomas manages to get the location of Carly then escapes in a taxi just before Bishop can stop him. Bishop, with sophisticated computer systems in his car, tracks down the taxi, calls the driver, tells him that his fare is incredibly dangerous and advises him to pull over at a petrol station. Bishop arrives seconds later, but Thomas has escaped. Playing back the petrol station's surveillance system, Bishop sees that Thomas got on the back of a truck, and Bishop again uses his computers to track the vehicle. Thomas reaches a cable car terminal and enters a gondola before Bishop can stop him. Bishop hollers to two thugs in the gondola that he will pay them ¬£10,000 to knock out Thomas. Thomas knocks them out in a brutal fight, then borrows a cellphone from an innocent passenger. He is able to call Ray, who meets him at the cable car terminal across the Thames. Bishop drives up and shoots Thomas in the abdomen as he jumps into Ray's car. They arrive at a safe house (apartment suite) where Ray cleans the bullet wound. Bishop has tracked them and blows out a wall from the next suite. Bishop kills Ray as he and Thomas flee. When Bishop returns to his car, Thomas emerges from the back seat, holding Bishop at gunpoint and directing him where to drive. Arriving at a dock, Thomas ties Bishop's hands and starts to question him, but Bishop breaks free. They have a brutal fight until Bishop is knocked into the water, failing to re-emerge. Thomas uses Bishop's car to get to Carly. Callister has finally sorted out the situation with the British authorities, and an embassy protection team arrive at Carly's location. Before they can leave, Cooper, his assistant Hannah, and three bodyguards arrive and shoot Stacy and kill the protection team. Cooper finds Carly and explains that he is her grandfather and loves her dearly. Thomas arrives, kills the bodyguards, and is surprised to find Bishop. The two have another brutal fight, ending when Thomas kicks Bishop onto a pickaxe, finally killing him. Thomas enters the house, kills Hannah and Cooper, and finally has Carly safely back in his arms.

The latter's son was Sir William Morice, 3rd Baronet (-1750), who died without progeny and by his will dated 1744 bequeathed his estates to his nephew Sir John St Aubyn, 4th Baronet (1726‚Äì1772),Risdon, p.400 son of his sister Catherine Morice and her husband Sir John St Aubyn, 3rd Baronet (1696‚Äì1744). =St Aubyn= Arms of St Aubyn: Ermine, on a cross sable five bezants Sir John St Aubyn, 4th Baronet (1726‚Äì1772),Risdon, p.400 was the son of Sir John St Aubyn, 3rd Baronet (1696‚Äì1744) by his wife Catherine Morice, sister and in her issue co-heoress of Sir William Morice, 3rd Baronet (-1750). The son of the 4th Baronet was Sir John St Aubyn, 5th Baronet (1758‚Äì1839), the owner of the estate in 1810 when it was stated of his inheritance of Stoke Damerel and Mount Wise: \\"The value of this property has probably increased as much as that of any landed property of its extent in the kingdom\\".Risdon, 1810 Additions, p.400 The population of the parish of Stoke Damerel, largely co-terminous with the manor, had increased from 3,361 in 1733 to 23,747 in 1800. The 5th Baronet's land in Stoke Damerel included the town of \\"Plymouth Dock\\", which he still owned in 1810, having sold to the government prior to that date the site of the Royal Dock Yard and the lines of military defence surrounding the town of \\"Plymouth Dock\\",Risdon, 1810 Additions, p.400 (\\"Devonport Dock Lines\\") which included Mount Wise. Military use Mount Wise indicated with yellow arrow on an 1851 map of Plymouth. The Royal Dockyard is to the immediate west (left), the whole complex being surrounded on the land side (north and east) by the \\"Devonport Dock Lines\\", a defensive wall visible on the map The defensive lines were in place by the mid-18th century. A large number of soldiers was required to man the defences; to house them, a series of square barracks was built around the perimeter in the late 1750s and early '60s. Admiralty House) on Mount Wise: built in 1789-93, it initially served as home and headquarters of the military Governor of Plymouth. With the Devonport Lines protecting the Dockyard from landward attack, Mount Wise provided the key vantage point for defending against an attack from the sea. An octagonal redoubt with stone walls was built on Mount Wise in the 1770s, forming an emplacement designed to house guns for the purpose of defending the Royal Dockyard. In 1806 a semaphore signalling station was built within it, the last of a series of 32 linking Plymouth with the Admiralty in London. In the 1960s much of the structure was demolished, but many relics survive such as the external walls, semi-circular metal racer rails for the guns, World War II barage balloon anchoring rings, ammunition recesses and iron rings for manoeuvring the heavy guns.http://hiddenplymouth.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/mount-wise-redoubt.html In 1998 a mast was built, with circular viewing platform for recreational use by visitors, giving panoramic views, most notably westward to the Royal William Yard. In the late 18th century, at the height of fears of a French invasion following the French Revolution (1789), a large house was built on Mount Wise to house the military Governor of Plymouth. To the north, it faced the southernmost of the barracks (St George's Square) across a large parade ground; to the south, it was given a large garden extending towards the sea. In 1804 an offshoot of the Royal Laboratory was set up on Mount Wise, just west of the redoubt, in buildings designed by Lewis Wyatt. The Royal Laboratory (established in Woolwich in the 17th century) was a department of the Board of Ordnance responsible for the manufacture and repair of small-arms ammunition. Between 1806 and 1814 some 70,000,000 cartridges were produced on Mount Wise and hundreds of men and boys were employed there; by the 1820s, the Napoleonic Wars having ended, the Laboratory had been reduced to a skeleton staff of five. In 1828, the Ordnance Board decided to close the Mount Wise Laboratory, citing the distance that had to be covered each day by the powder hoys that supplied the Laboratory with gunpowder from Keyham. By 1834 the Laboratory buildings had been converted into barracks accommodation and they remained in military use well into the 20th century. Admiralty use Shortly before 1810 the estate together with the site of the Royal Dockyard was purchased by the Admiralty from Sir John St Aubyn, 5th Baronet (1758‚Äì1839),Risdon, 1810 Additions, p.400 due to its strategic location, and became the Royal Navy's Maritime Headquarters.http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/plymouth-s-pound-13-5m-phase- mount-wise-housing/story-27544649-detail/story.html In the 19th-century it became the home of the Plymouth Garrison.Devon Life, The Village by the Sea The estate of Mount Wise was used by the Admiralty for about 200 years until it was abandoned in 2004 and was sold in 2006 by the Defence Estates for ¬£5.5million.Plymouth Herald, August 05, 2015, Plymouth's ¬£13.5m Phase Two Mount Wise housing set for completion Security guards stop vandals from trespassing in the bunker buildings.Mount Wise Navy Bunker Finally Busted Return to civilian usage In 2011 the estate of Mount Wise comprising 28 acres of land started its phase one development as \\"The Village by the Sea\\", a residential area with 469 new houses, Admiralty House converted into a 21-bed \\"boutique hotel\\", 32,000 sq ft of offices, a 4,500 sq ft convenience store, the restoration of the former naval cricket pitch and pavilion and the nuclear bunker converted to a 50,000 sq ft data storage centre.Devon Life, The Village by the Sea, Mount Wise, Plymouth, Devon, 5 January 2011 The development advisor stated: \\"We are not trying to build a city centre development; we will be creating a waterside village\\".Angus Macdonald, Development Advisor, Devon Life, The Village by the Sea The new buildings were planned to have a \\"Georgian-inspired feel\\" with Admiralty House retained \\"as the figurehead of the scheme\\".Angus Macdonald, Development Advisor, Devon Life, The Village by the Sea Phase one ended in 2012, but sales of the new properties were slow due to the continued effects of the 2008 global recession.Plymouth Herald, August 05, 2015, Plymouth's ¬£13.5m Phase Two Mount Wise housing set for completion The second phase of the development was due for completion in September 2015.http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/plymouth-s-pound-13-5m-phase-mount-wise- housing/story-27544649-detail/story.html Mount Wise House has been turned into offices, not the hotel as planned in phase one.

His parents were Otto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach (son of Rupert, King of Germany and younger brother of Louis III) and his wife Joanna of Bavaria-Landshut (eldest daughter of Henry XVI, Duke of Bavaria). Rupert's brother Albert became bishop of Strasbourg, whilst his other brother John became a canon and went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Albert, Rupert and John were grandsons of Rupert, King of Germany. Life He was recommended as bishop by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, Ladislaus the Posthumous and Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria, leaving pope Callixtus III little option but to confirm the nomination. The original choice had been Henry of Asberg, but this failed and was declared invalid, though Henry later succeeded Rupert after his early death. Rupert defended the prince-bishopric from the Hussites and the robber barons. At a synod held by Rupert sinecure owners were reassigned, whilst he also ensured that sermons were better related to the text of the scriptures and acquired the castle at Barbing as an episcopal residence.

The 277th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 7, 2016. The episode, while mostly concluding the season's plot, once again reiterated the season's commentary on trolling and Internet anonymity. Plot The SpaceX facility has finished using Heidi Turner's research to create a massive source of energy that can easily propel transport to Mars. But after realizing that Heidi intends to break his heart (according to his skewed perception), Cartman tries to convince various SpaceX staff to cancel the Mars project by explaining that his visions of life on a Mars colony ended with the enslavement of men. Kyle and Ike have recruited all of their remaining classmates to restart Skankhunt42's troll network. However, their mother Sheila Broflovski escapes from the pantry she was previously locked in, forcing Kyle and Ike to escape using a Fulton system. As she searches for them across a crumbling South Park, Sheila ends up at the Tuckers' house where a distraught Laura Tucker reveals that she has already used Troll Trace to reveal her husband Thomas' Internet history and invites Sheila to do the same. Sheila searches Ike first and discovers that he is innocent, but cannot bring herself to search Gerald. At The Pentagon, the US government realizes that the only way to stop Troll Trace is to overload the Internet with trolling to the point where it shuts down and resets itself. They coordinate with the trolling team in Denmark as well as Kyle and Ike to overload the system, but their effort cannot beat the now- active Troll Trace without a massive source of power: the Mars power source at SpaceX. In Denmark, Gerald Broflovski escapes from the control room with the help of both the troll team and the betrayed Troll Trace workers. He is guided across the facility to overload Troll Trace's operations, attracting the attention of Troll Trace CEO Lennart Bedrager. Bedrager confronts Gerald on a bridge leading to the final overload switch, resulting in a debate over the nature of trolling that Gerald \\"wins\\" by kicking Bedrager in the crotch and throwing him over a railing to his death. At the SpaceX facility, Cartman evacuates Elon Musk and the workers with a fake bomb threat from NASA before distracting Heidi long enough for Butters and an allied SpaceX employee to rig the Internet to the Mars power source. The combined effort to shut down the Internet works, destroying SpaceX and interrupting Sheila before she can complete her search for Gerald. Life returns to normal across the world as President Garrison takes his seat in the Oval Office before an assembled army of member berries. Gerald returns home to an oblivious Sheila and a furious Kyle and Ike. An old man in Florida sends out the first e-mail in the \\"new Internet\\" ‚Äì to troll his friend. Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode a 6.6 out of 10, summarizing his review, \\"There were plenty of funny moments along the way, but also a lot of plot threads left dangling and a generally anticlimactic conclusion to the TrollTrace storyline.\\" Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 3.0 out of 10, stating \\"It was a disappointing end to a disappointing season. Too many plot holes, too many things not membered, not enough funny.\\" Dan Caffrey with The A.V. Club rated the episode a C+, commenting \\"Whether it's the lack of consistent message or the emphasis on convoluted plot mechanics over jokes, South Park has felt unfocused for a few weeks now.\\" Chris Longo with Den of Geek gave it 4 out of 5 stars, and stated \\"What worked in spurts last season, one of my all-time favorites, was flat here, hence the episode title. Matt (Stone) and Trey (Parker) knew it, and they had a lot of fun saving a season that didn't wholly work by stringing together a self-deprecating season finale.\\"  References  External links *\\"Episode 2010 'The End of Serialization as We Know It' Press Release\\".

He was wounded in action on 2 September 1917 and died of his wounds two days later.'The Times‚Äô, 11 September 1917. Character Brian \\"Broo\\" Phillpotts as a young man Brian Phillpotts had many hobbies which developed his self-reliance and resource. At school he was particularly fond of chemistry, electricity and explosives, from the last of which he had more than one narrow escape. He was a keen sailor and used to venture out in heavy seas in small homemade boats constructed of painted calico stretched on a lath framework. He was also a clever mechanic. While in the army he used to have his own car, undertaking all the maintenance and repair work himself. He always had a working lathe somewhere in his quarters.Tribute, Brigadier General H.O. Mance CMG DSO RE, published in The Ouse (Bedford School Magazine), 10 November 1917. > \\"Anyone who met \\"Broo\\" Phillpotts could not fail to be attracted by the > charm of his manner, by his unfailing good humour and by his complete lack > of 'side'. Perhaps the most distinctive trait in his character was the > independence of his thought and judgment and also of his actions, coupled as > it was with the widest tolerance of the views of others. Where there was any > work to be done, whether on duty or in connection with any of his hobbies, > there was no shirking. He would not allow himself to be defeated, and his > unerring instinct and ingenuity generally led him straight to the essential > result by the shortest cut.\\"Tribute, Brigadier General H.O. Mance CMG DSO > RE, as above. Exploits on the War Front In preparation for the July 1916 offensive Major Phillpotts had to plan and supervise the construction of trenches for the assault troops within 150 yards of the enemy's position, and also the construction of roads and tramway lines so that ammunition, rations, water and other supplies could be transported up to the front. Later he was charged with the extension of the tramway lines into the enemy's position and the bridging of a canal. All these tasks had to be carried out under constant shell fire.Letter to J.S. Phillpotts, General C.J. Blackader, September 1917. > \\"[Phillpotts] always appeared perfectly oblivious to danger. No officer ever > set a finer example of utter contempt of all danger. He showed to others > what could be done in overcoming what appeared to be insurmountable > obstacles. The weather and the state of the ground were appalling, yet he > overcame them, and in a very short space of time we had a tramway and two > roads up to our new front line in the captured position. This was over two > and a half miles of Flanders mud, waist deep in most places. Mainly through > his exertions the Infantry in the front line had their full rations and were > kept supplied with everything.\\"Letter to J.S. Phillpotts, General C.J. > Blackader, September 1917. In 1916 the headquarters for Phillpotts' company were established at Ville- sous-Corbie. A large barn in a barren field was all the accommodation available. Within a fortnight Major Phillpotts made comfortable beds of timber and wire netting for everyone as well as cook houses and stables. He rigged up a simple crane and installed a band saw, two circular saws, a drilling machine, a lathe and a grindstone. All this equipment was driven from one shaft by two ten horsepower steam engines and a small petrol engine. Most of the machinery was salvaged from damaged French factories at Albert. The saws were used to form beams and sleepers out of logs culled from nearby woods. The waste wood chippings and bark were used as fuel to heat water for two communal bath tubs set up by the major.Reminiscences, Sergeant Frank H. Aincham RE. During the Somme operation Major Phillpotts also constructed improvised shelters consisting of curved steel bowers made of salvaged lengths of rail covered over and reinforced with timber and sandbags. \\"Such covers saved many lives during the eight days' bombardment which preceded the July offensive in 1916.\\"Reminiscences, Sergeant Frank H.

It is surrounded by the Metropolitan Bel√©m Environmental Protection Area, which protects a large part of the water supply of the city. Location The Utinga State Park is in the city of Bel√©m, Par√°, within the Metropolitan Bel√©m Environmental Protection Area (APA). It has an area of . It is divided between the municipalities of Bel√©m (99%) and Ananindeua (1%). It is just a few kilometers from the city center. The park is a fully protected conservation unit, so direct exploitation of resources such as hunting or fishing in the lakes is prohibited. Sustainable use of natural resources is allowed in the APA, which covers the entire catchment area of the √Ågua Preta and Bolonha lakes and the Aur√° River. History The Metropolitan Bel√©m Environmental Protection Area (APA) was created by decree 1.551 of 3 May 1993 in the municipalities of Bel√©m and Ananindeua, with an area of about , administered by the state environmental secretariat (SEMA). The Utinga State Park was created by decree 1.552 of 3 May 1993. The management plan was published in 1994. The goals are to extend the useful life of the Bolonha and √Ågua Preta lakes, which supply about 60% of the population of the metropolitan region, and ensure water potability through management of water sources and recovery of degraded areas; to protect the landscape, forests and other types of vegetation, preserve representative samples of biodiversity as a gene bank and protect animals that take refuge in the park due to expansion of the surrounding urban areas; and to preserve a green space to improve the quality of life of the population and support scientific, cultural, educational and recreational activities and tourism. The management council was created by ordinance 1.365 of 8 July 2009, and includes representatives from government agencies such as SEMA, universities such as the Federal University of Par√° and Universidade da Amaz√¥nia, and civil society groups such as Imazon, community associations and so on. By 2011 the management plan no longer met current environmentalist and legal standards, and an update was initiated, which was published in August 2013 The updated plan was prepared by Imazon, the Institute of Man and the Environment of the Amazon. Activities The park provides a space for healthy activities in contact with nature by local people, visitors or tourists. Visitors are expected to enjoy the park quietly and refrain from littering. There are eight trails, all providing direct contact with various species of flora and fauna. The most popular is the monkey trail, which takes about 40 minutes and goes from Bolonha lake to the visitor center, where other activities are available. Guided tours are available for groups of 7 to 35 people. Visitors can also learn about the water treatment plant that supplies Bel√©m. Environment Foggy morning in the park The vegetation is in the Amazon biome and includes terra firme forest, secondary forest and igap√≥ flooded forest, as well as aquatic vegetation. The flora of the APA is very rich, and contributes environmental services to the city such as regulating the microclimate, ensuring soil stability, conserving good quality water, cleaning the air and storing carbon. Trees include the Carapa (andiroba), which gives seeds with medicinal properties, the huge Ceiba pentandra (sama√∫ma) and the Brazil nut. A quick ecological assessment of fauna in the park identified 25 species of fish, 7 species of amphibians, 26 species of reptiles, 193 species of birds, 3 species of small mammals and 23 of medium and large mammals. Common fauna in the APA include spiders such as tarantulas, Brazilian wandering spiders, recluse spiders and Sibynomorphus mikanii; snakes such as water snakes, Coral snakes, false corals, Bothrops jararaca, boa constrictors, anacondas, Corallus hortulanus, Oxybelis fulgidus, Chironius and Sibynomorphus mikanii; amphibians such as Hylomantis granulosa, Rhinella, Leptodactylus labyrinthicus and Tropidurus semitaeniatus, reptiles such as iguana and spectacled caiman; primates such as robust capuchin monkeys, common squirrel monkey, pale- throated sloth; and other mammals such as coatis, paca, common agouti and capybara. Birds include toucans, black-necked aracari (Pteroglossus aracari), hummingbirds, Amazon kingfisher (Chloroceryle amazona), collared puffbird (Bucco capensis), great kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus), cream-colored woodpecker (Celeus flavus), neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), anhinga (Anhinga anhinga), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), plain parakeet (Brotogeris tirica), great egret (Ardea alba), barn owl (Tyto alba), laughing falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans), bat falcon (Falco rufigularis), southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), pauraque (Nyctidromus albicollis), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana), chestnut-bellied seed finch (Oryzoborus angolensis) and tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba). As of 2013 the process of indemnifying former owners was incomplete. Issues included illegal entry, hunting and fishing, construction of irregular housing, unregulated leisure activities, disposal of household waste and sewage in the lakes, and trimming of trees in the ELETRONORTE and COSANPA power corridors.

The Andreasstift was a building complex in Worms, Germany, now housing Worms City Museum. It is located near Worms Cathedral and the Magnuskirche. The community it housed was founded before 1000 as a mountain-top community but was moved to a new building within Worms' city walls in 1020 by order of bishop Burchard of Worms. He also ordered the building of the cathedral and of two churches dedicated to St Paul and St Martin. He supported the election of his pupil Henry II and thus became sole ruler of Worms. The complex now centres on the former Andreaskirche, founded between 1180 and 1200 as a three-aisled Romanesque church. The church's north door shows similarities to the west choir of Worms Cathedral, suggesting it was built at the same time. Two wings of its cloister survive and are now used as a lapidarium. The church's windows were replaced with Gothic style ones after a fire in 1200. The humanist Peter Anton von Clapis became its provost in 1470. The church and monastery were destroyed in 1689 during the Nine Years' War and only restored in 1761. The final provost was Clemens August von Stefne. In 1800 the monastery and church were secularized and desanctified by Napoleon I, seeing use as a barracks, a hay barn, a fruit yard, a fire station and the base for the town's official carriages. It was restored again from 1928 to 1930 thanks to a legacy of 200,000 gold marks from Baron Maximilian von Heyl, the younger brother of the Worms industrialist Cornelius Wilhelm von Heyl. The area was occupied by France from November 1918 onwards. The end of the occupation was marked on 1 July 1930 by a procession from the city museum (then in the Paulusstift) to the Andreasstift - this also marked the museum's transfer to the Andreasstift. The complex was almost completely destroyed by Allied air raids in the final months of World War Two. It was restored between 1945 and 1947 during the second French occupation of the area and again in 2007.

Description and history The Willard Manufacturing Company is located in the industrial areas of St. Albans that flank the tracks of the Central Vermont Railroad. It is set on the north side of Stowell Street, at its junction with Allen Street, which runs north-south along the tracks. It is a flat-roofed two story wood-frame building, extending for about along Stowell Street. It is set on a limestone foundation, and its roof has a slightly projecting cornice with occasional exposed rafter ends. Windows are tall and rectangular, with fixed upper portions and a short bottom sash. A single-story addition extends westward from the main block, with garage bay openings facing Allen Street. The interior has a lobby at the eastern end, and a largely open factory space on the balance of the ground floor, with offices and a showroom on the east end of the upper level. with The Willard Manufacturing Company was founded in 1886 by Rodney S. Willard, a prominent local garment manufacturer, by merging two businesses in which he was a partner. The business first produced overalls and frocks, but expanded to produce undergarments, hosiery, and swimwear. This factory was built in 1896 on land acquired from W. Beecher Fonda, a company board member who owned the adjacent lumber yard. The city had in 1895 suffered a devastating fire in its downtown area, and this factory was built using the latest in fire resistance and suppression methods. The Willard Company operated into the early 1940s, producing military uniforms during World War II. Its building was acquired in 1942 by the George H. Soule Company, makers of maple syrup evaporators. The Soule Company was responsible for partition some of the factory space for offices and other uses, and the addition of the garage to the west end. It was later owned by the Leader Evaporator Company, which moved to a modern plant in 2006. The building was later converted to apartments.

The book tells the story of George and Willie Muse, two African-American brothers who were kidnapped and forced to perform as sideshow attractions because they were albinos. Truevine was released on October 18, 2016 through Little, Brown and Company. Film rights for the book are currently being negotiated by Paramount Pictures and Appian Way Productions. Synopsis George and Willie Muse are two brothers growing up in Truevine, part of a sharecropping family that live in a tobacco farming community near Roanoke, Virginia. The two brothers were both albinos, a feature that Willie claimed prompted a circus man to abduct the two children in 1899 while they worked in a field. In the book, Macy notes that it was possible that the children were sent to the circus by their mother, as their albino skin made it unlikely that they would survive long as sharecroppers, but that \\"if you ask me in my heart, I'm gonna go with [Willie Muse's] story\\". They performed for years as sideshow attractions where they were cruelly exploited and frequently portrayed as savages from another country or Martians. George and Willie were prevented from contacting their family by their manager, who kept them as modern day slaves, since they were unpaid. The two boys were told that their mother Harriet was dead ‚Äì a lie, as their mother was still alive and was constantly searching for them. She eventually found the two boys working for the Ringling Brothers Circus and their family was reunited. Harriet successfully sued Ringling Brothers for the treatment of George and Willie. George and Willie resumed performing for the circus in the late 1920s, where they finally received pay for their work. George died in 1971 and Willie died in 2001. The book also details Macy's work at finding information about the two brothers and gaining the trust of their niece Nancy Saunders, who cared for Willie until his death. Development Macy learned about the Muses in the 1980s, when she began working for The Roanoke Times. She was told that it was \\"the best story in town\\" but that no one had been able to get the complete story due to the protectiveness of the Muse family. Macy approached Saunders but was initially rebuffed due to the number of people that tried to invade the men's privacy with \\"rude\\" questions. She was given permission to write a series of news articles about Willie and George after the latter of the two brothers died in 2001 and Saunders approved of Macy's plans to write a book about the brothers in late 2013. Macy searched through news clippings and trade presses and also gained information from the Muse family. She also approached older members of the African-American community in Roanoke, where she discovered that some of them assumed that the story of the Muses was a hoax and that \\"Some of them thought it was true; some of them lived near George and Willie in their later years and were scared of them like a Boo Radley figure.\\" Reception Critical reception has been positive. Truevine received reviews from Edward E. Baptist and Janet Maslin, the former of which wrote that \\"Macy is a gifted storyteller and a dogged researcher, and readers will be riveted by her account of Harriet Muse's struggle to find her sons.\\" USA Today gave the work four and a half stars, as they felt that \\"Macy's conscientious reporting (affirming the story's accuracy) and her vigorous storytelling make the saga of George and Willie Muse even more enthralling than fiction.\\" References External links * *Presentation by Macy on Truevine, October 15, 2016 *Interview with Macy on Truevine, March 19, 2017 2016 non- fiction books Circus books Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus Albinism in popular culture ","title":"Truevine"},{"id":"52481726","text":"Aleksandra Petrova reads at the Heyman Center at Columbia University in 2015. Alexandra Gennadievna Petrova (Russian: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞–¥–∏–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞) (born 30 April 1964 in Leningrad) is a Russian poet and writer.

According to the expert Nelly Ognyanova, lack of transparency in media ownership is one of the major problem in the media system in Bulgaria. In Bulgaria there are specific provisions concerning print, electronic media and broadcast media. The relevant law, in particular the Law on Radio and Television and the Law on Mandatory Deposition of Press and Other Works, requires the submission of data identifying the actual owners of electronic and print media and online registers are available to the public. Also, a law imposing restrictions on offshore companies to acquire shares and assets in different fields including the media sector, entered into force in 2014. In addition, under Bulgarian law, media are obliged to provide information about ownership upon request in conformity with the provisions set forth in the Law on Access to Public Information. Despite the existence of these legal transparency obligations, there are several problems concerning, on one side the application of the rules, on the other, the requirements themselves, which are not enough effective in ensuring the disclosure of the actual owners. Also, legal requirements are constantly circumvented and sanctions usually not applied. Moreover, according to experts, the law should not be limited to obligations concerning the ownership, but expand its scope to examine the origin of funding of media outlets as well. Overall, despite recent legislative changes, some loopholes remain, allowing non-transparency as regards to media ownership and funding and making possible to circumvent the law and conceal who the true owners of the media are. According to expert Ognyanova, there are several ways of circumventing the legal requirements: one example is the case of Krasikir Gergov, a former agent of the Communist-era State Security services and owner of advertising agencies that, while acting in the guise of a ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù, actually had a share of the ownership and a contract allowing him to exercise control over the newsroom of a media outlet in Bulgaria. According to Professor Georgi Lozanov, a former member of the Council for Electronic Media, the introduction of the Access to Information Law could help in making more transparent the media sector, in particular media ownership and sources of funds which are largely opaque in Bulgaria. \\"There is no transparency of media capital whatsoever and one never knows what the real situation is [...]. The introduction of the Access to Information Act [...] represented an attempt at bringing the media to supply information about the sources and funds. Because, if you set up a media outlet and sell a product which is directly related to freedom of speech, it is normal to be able to track the business from the very beginning, thai is, to track the genealogy of the message in the business sense\\", remarked Professor Lozanov. Media-specific disclosure requirements for print media In Bulgaria media organisations are required to report ownership information to a media authority under the Mandatory Deposition of Print and Other Materials Act (MDPOMA), in force since January 2001 and amended in 2010. The law covers only the print media and provides that information on ownership should be reported to the Ministry of Culture which has the responsibility to collect and publish online data on ownership submitted by print media. The law does not require the disclosure of the size of shareholding but includes the disclosure of the names of people holding shares on behalf of another (beneficial ownership) through brokerage and provides a definition of \\"ultimate owner\\" Also, under the MDPOMA law, newspapers and magazines are obliged to disclose their ownership data directly to the public through the publication of this information on the first issue of each newspaper each calendar year and every time there is a change in ownership or control of the media organisation. Overall, existing obligations under MDPOMA does not, on its own, allow to know the legal or natural persons who effectively own and ultimately control the media operating in Bulgaria because the size of shareholding is not made public. This information can only be obtained by cross-referencing the data provided under MDPOMA with those available in the Company Register, a public register containing ownership information on all the registered companies in the country. Another weakness in the transparency system of print media concerns the lack of guarantees for disclosing equity that secure media financially and by which ownership is acquired. Besides criticism regarding legal provisions themselves, the implementation is another matter. Indeed, a further critical point concerns the effectiveness of the disclosure regime, with particular regard with the functioning of the sanctions system required by the law. As a matter of fact, according to public records consulted by Access-Info Europe, in the past few years there have not been cases of sanctions applied despite the fact that there have been evidence of cases of non-disclosure. This situation led to an article in the magazine Capital Weekly on January 2012 that revealed that many authorities in Bulgaria are not familiar with their obligations under the law. A study conducted in 2014 shows that a series of important ownership changes in the Bulgarian media system that occurred in that year had not been recorded as it should have been done. There are also journalistic investigations corroborating the fact that publishers of print media fail to comply with their duty to submit the required data and no fine have been imposed to sanction this. Media-specific disclosure requirements for broadcast media The broadcast media are covered by the Radio and Television Act (RTA), adopted in 2008 and amended in 2010 and 2012. The law provides that broadcast media should present ownership data to the Electronic Media Council which has the responsibility to maintain public registers containing, among others, the data on ownership collected by the Council. In particular, the law provides the disclosure of data on natural or legal persons exerting control over the management structure of the media concerned. The law defines \\"control over the media services provider\\" when a person controls, also by means of connected persons, more than 50% of the voters, or could directly or indirectly appoint more than 50% of the managing body of the media services provider, or could exert a significant influence on the decision-making process. Also, according to the RTA, interests held by owners (for instance, as shareholder or partner) in other media organisations have to be made public. Ownership information collected in the Register can be accessed online. The major weak point of the disclosure regime for broadcast media concerns the fact that the obligation to make public the size of beneficial owners through brokerage is non-existent, even if, at the moment, brokerage is not a common practice in ownership media patterns in Bulgaria. Non Media-Specific Transparency Requirements The law regulates the disclosure of ownership information for media organisations regularly registered as companies is the Company Register Act adopted in 2006 and in force since January 2008. As not all media are registered companies, as a matter of fact this law does not cover all media outlets operating in Bulgaria. For the media companies covered by the scope of this law, information have to be made to the Company Register, which is a public register. Information to be disclosed under this law includes: names of directors, names of shareholders (comprising beneficial shareholders through brokerage), members of management and supervisory boards, size of shareholdings, management details, the outcome of the company decision-making process, financial reports, constitutive acts, etc. Information on those with indirect control is also made public. This information is recorded electronically and available to the public online via the company register website maintained by the Registry Agency. Even if not all media operating in Bulgaria are covered by the scope of this provisions, overall, the information to be disclosed in the Company Register is quite comprehensive and is usually sufficient to ascertain the owners of the media registered as companies. Transparency requirements regarding Access to Public Information The Bulgarian law on Access to Public Information sets forth some general requirements concerning transparency regarding management and ownership of the media. According to the law, citizens and legal persons are entitled to access information regarding: * persons taking part in the management of exercise effective control over the management or operations; * economically associated persons who take part in the management of other mass media and that exercise control in the media; * information about the financial results of the media owner.

In 1956 she founded the East German arts and fashion magazine which bore her name, Sibylle, working with the publication as its editor in chief till 1961. Life =Early years= Sibylle Boden was born in Breslau (since 1945 known as Wroclaw) into a German- Jewish family. Her father was a furrier and merchant who probably later died in a Silesian prison during the Shoah. Her mother was a businesswoman. Her grandfather, Moritz Boden, was Jewish and his wife converted to Judaism for her husband's sake. In the 1930s this meant Sibylle Boden was classified as a \\"j√ºdischer Mischling\\" (sometimes translated, loosely, as \\"Jewish mongrel\\"). Between 1926 and 1936 she was educated first at a private school and then at the Realgymnasium (traditional secondary school) in Breslau. In 1936 she moved to Berlin where she studied at the Textiles and Fashion Academy. Her teachers included Maria May and Erna Hitzberger. She briefly attended the Berlin Arts Academy where she studied painting and illustration. However, the Nazi government came to power at the start of 1933. In 1936 it became impossible for Boden to progress with her studies due to her Jewish background. She was able briefly to pursue her studies at the Academy of \\"Arts and Crafts\\" in Vienna, where her studies focused on painting, graphic art and theatre costume design, until Austria was merged into an enlarged Nazi state in March 1938, and she left. =War years= Boden first met the government lawyer (and, later, journalist) Karl-Heinz Gerstner at a ski resort in the Riesengebirge (literally \\"Giant Mountains) in southern Silesia. War had broken out a few months earlier, but Gerstner was excused military service due to the effects of his childhood spinal paralysis. The couple fell in love and eventually married after the war, in 1945. Gerstner had joined the Nazi Party in 1933. By 1945 it is apparent from his active support for the French Resistance and rescuing of Jewish families ahead of scheduled deportation that he was no longer a Nazi supporter, but in 1940 he was seen as a member of the Nazi establishment. The son of a diplomat, and already fluent in French, since July 1940 he had been working as a legal and economic assistant at the German embassy in Paris, and through his intervention Boden was able to escape, illegally, to Paris in autumn of 1940. In Paris she was able to resume her study of painting, now at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, where her attendance is described in one source as \\"undercover\\". Nevertheless, when in 1942 she took part in an exhibition produced by the Beaux-Arts academy, two of her works won a first and a third prize. She shared much of her life in Paris with Gerstner; together they attended Parisian Haute couture fashion shows, at which Boden-Gerstner was able to sketch the latest designs of fashion designers such as Christian Dior and Jacques Fath, sending her drawings to an agent in the Netherlands. She and Gerstner also visited socially the high-profile fashion designer Jacques Fath. In the summer of 1944 most German diplomats were recalled to Berlin. Boden returned with Gerstner, who was given a job in the capital with the Foreign Ministry. They participated in political actions against the Nazi r√©gime in Berlin- Wilmersdorf. =After the war= War ended in May 1945. Under the terms of the London Protocol, signed in September 1944, the principal Allies of World War II had agreed to a postwar partition of Berlin between themselves into four separately administered zones of occupation; but directly after the war the entire city was occupied by Soviet forces. In the Wilmersdorf quarter of Berlin the Soviet commander appointed Gerstner deputy mayor. In May of that year, the couple were able, finally, to marry. Boden-Gerstner took a teaching job at a private fashion academy and contributed the fashion pages for a newspaper, also designing clothes. Shortly after this, an exhibition was held in the city under the title \\"Befreite Schwingen\\" (loosely: \\"Swing free\\") at which her paintings were exhibited alongside those of Carl Hofer, Max Pechstein and Gustav Seitz. In 1946, British military police arrived in Wilmersdorf and arrested Gerstner, believing that his job in Paris meant that he must have been a senior Nazi official. The British handed him over to the Soviet forces. Boden-Gerstner was able to obtain statements from former resistance members in France attesting to his secret wartime work with the French Resistance and his contribution to saving Jewish families scheduled for deportation to the death camps. These documents were enough to secure Gerstner's release from the Soviet \\"special camp\\" at Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen. In Gerstner's 1999 memoirs he referred to the evidence Boden-Gerstner gathered to secure his release, stating \\"I owe her my life\\" (\\"Ich verdanke ihr mein Leben\\"). =Soviet occupation zone/German Democratic Republic= The couple's Wilmersdorf home was in the British occupation zone of Berlin, but they later moved to Zeuthen on the south eastern edge of the city, which was administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone till October 1949, when the entire Soviet zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Gerstner-Boden remained at the Berlin private fashion academy she had joined in 1945, serving as its head until 1949. After 1949 she concentrated on costume design, but also continued to produced paintings under her maiden name, Sibylle Boden. Although sources describe her costume design work as \\"free-lance\\", it is clear that in or around 1949 she was talent spotted by the DEFA, the East German national film company, working for them in collaboration with the film director Wolfgang Staudte. After 1951 she had a permanent contract for costume design work with the DEFA. She also undertook costume design work for East German television. In 1953 the family relocated again, moving to a house in the prestigious suburb of Kleinmachnow on the north eastern edge of Berlin. In July 1956 she founded the arts and fashion magazine Sibylle and became its arts chief. Calling it by her own name was originally intended as a \\"test\\", but the name stuck. When it was decided that it needed an editor in chief, between 1958 and 1961 Gerstner-Boden took the position. She developed regular features such as \\"Wir sahen in Paris\\" (\\"What we saw in Paris\\") and \\"Sibylle fragt\\" (\\"Sibylle asks\\"). The magazine presented clothes, drapes and accessories. The managing director was required and permitted to travel frequently to destinations such as Paris, Milan, Prague, Warsaw and Moscow. Sibylle was a large-format publication produced six times a year, with carefully composed minimalist covers. Fashion models were often seen against \\"abstract\\" backgrounds. Title fonts were simple. To some extent, the simplicity was born of economic necessity, but when she was interviewed in 2013 Boden-Gerstner was keen to point out the extent to which it anticipated future trends, describing the publication as a cross between The New Yorker and Vogue. It was not ashamed to flaunt uncompromising luxury, even to readers in a workers' and peasants' state. In this way it also expressed a kind of dissidence, or even stubbornness. Sibylle was a success, always sold out even when print runs peaked at 200,000 copies. In the end, the direction taken by the magazine was determined to be \\"too French for Socialism\\" (\\"zu franz√∂sisch f√ºr den Sozialismus\\"), and in 1961 Boden-Gerstner had to resign. When she was later asked about this in an interview she said \\"The others were jealous, and probably wanted my job. The magazine continued to carry my stamp\\" (\\"Ach, die waren eifers√ºchtig und wollten wahrscheinlich meinen Posten. Das Magazin trug meine Handschrift und dabei blieb ich.\\"). After 1961 Boden-Gerstner returned to her work as a free-lance costume designer for the DEFA film studio and East German television. Some of the most successful films on which she worked included Wolf Among Wolves, subsequently a television series, and significant as the first East German movie also screened for West German audiences. Others were a \\"remake\\" of Little Man, What Now?, \\"Abschied vom Frieden\\" (\\"Leaving Peace behind\\") and The Fianc√©e. She also worked during this period as a simultaneous translator between German, French and English. Personal Boden-Gerstner had two daughters: Daniela Dahn (born 1949), a writer, journalist and controversialist. She considered herself a dissident as a young woman in the German Democratic Republic, and continues to be an establishment critic of the unified Germany. Sonja Gerstner (1952‚Äì1971) was a writer and painter who first showed signs of psychosis when she was 16 and committed suicide three years later. Published under the pseudonym Sibylle Muthesius, Boden-Gerstner's book, Flucht in die Wolken appeared in 1981 in East Germany. By 1992 it had reached seven editions. It first appeared in West Germany in 1982, complete with a substantial epilogue by Margarete Mitscherlich-Nielsen. The book provides a narrative of her daughter Sonja's illness, treatments and suicide. Death Sibylle Boden-Gerstner died on 25 December 2016 at the age of 96.
