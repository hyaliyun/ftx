The NKVD crashed a Zionist group meeting, and arrested all the participants, including Borys, who was convicted and sent to a Gulag in Siberia for three years. After many applications for release, he was allowed to leave the Soviet Union and go to Palestine, without permission to see his family, and nor to ever return to the Soviet Union. Borys worked in the fields around Ra'anana, but later moved to Jerusalem, to the Zikhron Moshe neighbourhood, next door to Ephraim Katzir, a friend of Borys', and later to become the President of Israel. After arriving in Palestine, Borys changed his name to Dov (Hebrew: ◊ì◊ï◊ë, lit: bear) Gazit (Hebrew: ◊í÷∏◊ñ÷¥◊ô◊™, lit: huge stone. dressed stone, ashlar, as used in construction of Solomon's Temple).

The two stayed in Eritrea for more than three years, constructing an airbase for the British. Their mandate was not only to build the airbase, but to learn how to develop and to manage the infrastructure which would be so important in sustaining the new state of Israel. During his term of service in Africa, Dov also studied aeronautical engineering, and graduated from the British University in Egypt, in Cairo. Dov served in the Haganah. He spent much of his time in Jerusalem, walking patrols through the streets of Jewish sections. Dov Gazit was sent to Czechoslovakia, as part of the group that acquired and delivered the first aircraft, Avia S-199s and Spitfires, for the newly formed Israeli air force. After Israel declared independence, Dov served as chief-commander of the IAF (Israeli Air Force) Technical School in Haifa.

Dr. Aaron Schulow (Aharon Shulov, who, like Dov Gazit, had also come to Palestine after being accused and jailed for Jewish Crimes in his native Russia (Dr. Shulov established the faculty of Zoology in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem), and the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, asked Dov to find and send back to Jerusalem an African lion. Dov found a lion cub for sale in the market. He took the Zoo's new acquisition back to his, where he and Yeri cared for the cub for several months. With the lion cub growing too large to keep in their quarters, he managed to get the cat to Alexandria, and on a boat to Palestine. The lion cub, the first lion in the Dr. Shulov's new zoo, was renamed Yehudah (Lion of Judah). Dr. Aharon Shulov wrote a history of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, and on pages 47‚Äì51, he detailed Dov Gazit's adventures in acquiring Fifi, and getting the cub from Africa to Jerusalem.

The trunk is grey, robust and ringed with leaf scars; old leaves remain attached to the trunk for several years before falling cleanly. The leaves are fan-shaped and long, with robust black teeth on the petiole margins. Like all Borassus species, B. flabellifer is dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. The male flowers are less than 1 cm long and form semi-circular clusters, which are hidden beneath scale-like bracts within the catkin-like inflorescences. In contrast, the female flowers are golfball-sized and solitary, sitting upon the surface of the inflorescence axis. After pollination, these blooms develop into fleshy fruits 15‚Äì25 cm wide, each containing 1-3 seeds. The fruits are black to brown with sweet, fibrous pulp and each seed is enclosed within a woody endocarp. Young palmyra seedlings grow slowly, producing only a few leaves each year (establishment phase), but at an as yet undetermined time, they grow rapidly, producing a substantial stem. Uses =Fruit= The fruit (Palmyra fruit) measures to in diameter, has a black husk, and is borne in clusters. The top portion of the fruit must be cut off to reveal the sweet jelly seed sockets, translucent pale-white, similar to that of the lychee but with a milder flavor and no pit. The sweet jelly seed sockets occur in combinations of two, three or four seeds inside the fruit. The jelly part of the fruit is covered with a thin, yellowish-brown skin. These are known to contain watery fluid inside the fleshy white body. These seed sockets have been the inspiration behind certain Sandeshes called Jalbhora (‡¶ú‡¶≤‡¶≠‡¶∞‡¶æ) found in Bengal. The soft orange-yellow mesocarp pulp of the ripe fruit is sugary, dense and edible, rich in vitamin A and C. They also contain bitter compound called flabelliferrins, which are steroidal saponins. The conventional way this fruit is eaten is when the outer casing is still unripe while the seeds are eaten as the fruit. But if the entire fruit is left to ripen, the fibrous outer layer of the palm fruits can also be eaten raw, boiled, or roasted. When this happens, the fruit takes a purple-blackish hue and tastes similar to coconut flesh. The skin is also eaten as part of the fruit similar to how mango skins are often consumed along with the fruit. Bengali People have perfected the art of making various sweet dishes with the yellowish viscous fluid substance obtained from a ripe palm fruit. These include mustard oil-fried (alternately sunflower oil-fried) Taal- er bora (‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ) \\"palmyra vadas\\" or mixed with thickened milk to prepare Taal-kheer (‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßÄ‡¶∞). In Kerala it is called Pananungu whereas in Tamil Nadu, it is called as Nungu (‡Æ®‡ØÅ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ). Ice apple in Indonesia is called Buah Lontar or Siwalan.

The juice collected in evening or after fermentation becomes sour, and is called Tadi (‡§§‡§æ‡§°‡•Ä) in Marathi. This sap was the main source of sugar production in Thailand before sugarcane was introduced, as can be seen in the Thai word for sugar, nam tan (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•), which literally means the water of the tala palm A sugary sap called toddy can be obtained from the young inflorescence, either male or female. Toddy is fermented to make a beverage called arrack, or it is concentrated to a crude sugar called jaggery or Taal Patali (‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßÄ) in Bengali and Pana Vellam or Karuppukatti (‡Æï‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø or ‡Æï‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø) in Tamil. It is called Gula Jawa (Javanese sugar) in Indonesia, and is widely used in Javanese cuisine. In Thailand, it is called nam tan pik (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏õ‡∏∂‡∏Å), referring to the pack of sugar obtained from drying the palm sap, though in the modern day nam tan pik is often made from coconut water because the convenient of farming and harvesting. In Thailand, there are techniques that utilize the anti-bacterial agents of some woods to keep the sap from becoming sour while tapping. After sterilization, the sap is available as a beverage called nam tan sod (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏™‡∏î, ) or used to make an alcoholic beverage called nam tan mao (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏≤ ) =Sprouts= In the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar, and in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, the seeds are planted and made to germinate and the fleshy stems (below the surface) are boiled or roasted and eaten.

The germinated seed's hard shell is also cut open to take out the crunchy kernel, which tastes like a sweeter water chestnut. It is called Buragunju (‡∞¨‡±Å‡∞∞‡∞ó‡±Å‡∞Ç‡∞ú‡±Å) in Telugu and \\"thavanai\\" in Tamil. The white kernel of the ripe palm fruit after being left for a few months is used as an offering in Lakshmi Puja in various parts of Bengal and is also eaten raw. =Leaves= Female tree, showing foliage crown with fruit Male tree with flower Sugar palm as seen in Mumbai, India The Borassus flabellifer leaves are used for thatching, mats, baskets, fans, hats, umbrellas, and as writing material. All the literature of the old Tamil was written in preserved Palm leaves also known as Palm-leaf manuscript. In Tamil Yaedu or Olai chuvadi. Most of the ancient literature in Telugu are written on palm leaves (Tala patra grandhas). In Indonesia the leaves were used in the ancient culture as paper, known as \\"lontar\\". Leaves of suitable size, shape, texture, and maturity were chosen and then seasoned by boiling in salt water with turmeric powder, as a preservative. The leaves were then dried. When they were dry enough, the face of the leaf was polished with pumice, cut into the proper size, and a hole made in one corner. Each leaf made four pages. The writing was done with a stylus and had a very cursive and interconnected style. The stem of the leaves has thorny edges (called \\"karukku\\" in Tamil). The skin of the stem can be peeled off and be used as rope and also used to weave into cots (‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç in Tamil). In some part of Tamil Nadu, a variety of rice flour cake (called \\"Kolukattai\\") is prepared using the leaf. In the eastern part of India, the leaves are used to make hand fans. =Trunk= The stalks are used to make fences and also produce a strong, wiry fiber suitable for cordage and brushes. The black timber is hard, heavy, and durable and is highly valued for construction. =Crown= When the crown of the tree is removed, the segment from which the leaves grow out is an edible cake. This is called 'pananchoru (‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Æû‡Øç‡Æö‡Øã‡Æ±‡ØÅ) in Tamil or thati adda (‡∞§‡∞æ‡∞ü‡∞ø ‡∞Ö‡∞°‡±ç‡∞°/‡∞§‡∞æ‡∞ü‡∞ø ‡∞Æ‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞ü) in Telugu. =Roots= In Cambodia, where the palm is known as thn√¥t' (Khmer), the roots are dried and smoked to heal nasal complaints.)

Built by Swiss manufacturer Intamin, the ride opened in 2006 and features a rare element known as a \\"Norwegian Loop\\". History The ride was announced on July 7, 2005 and was revealed to be TusenFryd's biggest investment in its history, at a cost of 60 million kroner (about ‚Ç¨7.5 million). It was also announced that the ride would feature a hydraulic launch and three inversions. Due to the park's unique topography, the ride is partially located upon a 20 metre high rock slope and weaves its way through trees. The harsh climate and rocky location made construction difficult, with areas of soft earth requiring deeper foundations. Construction was completed in December 2005 in icy conditions. Soon after completion, heavy snowfall left drifts of 1 metre in the area, which would have held up construction had the ride not been complete. Since its opening, Speed Monster has been sponsored by Mazda, tying in with the race car theming present throughout the ride. Ride experience Each of the two racing car themed trains consists of three cars, each with four seats for a capacity of 12 riders per train. Upon leaving the station, riders are accelerated from 0 to 55.9 miles per hour in 2.2 seconds before negotiating the long course. Speed Monster is the world's first roller coaster to feature a \\"Norwegian Loop\\", an element which inverts riders twice and wraps around Tusenfryd's unusual entrance escalators.

The municipal cemetery can be found on its premises and on the hillsides, the characteristic wine cellars and remains of old wine-presses can be seen. thumb Lastly, it is possible to see models of popular architecture with wooden framework in its walls, which survived the fire of Nava de Roa in the XIX century. Wheat, barley and beetroot are grown in the village. More importantly grapes are also grown in the village, of which Designation of Origin wines are made. There are two wineries dedicated to its production and use: Montebell√≥n Winery and Vineyards and Se√±or√≠o de Nava Winery. History of Nava de Roahttps://www.rutadelvinoriberadelduero.es/es/poblacion-ribera-del- duero/nava-roa ''' The village emerged from the medieval repopulation during the X and XI centuries; its greatest period of glory was between the XVI and the XVIII centuries. It benefited from being a hub of communication and a cross roads (Valladolid-Soria- and Segovia-Zaragoza). In 1591, the community had 1,569 residents. At the fall of the old regime it remained constituted as the Town Council of the judicial district of Roa with 186 dwellings and 605 residents. The XIX century marked the decline of Nava de Roa with two incidents: the total destruction (1836) in the period of the First Carlist War by General Miguel G√≥mez Damas and the Phylloxera Plague which eliminated the vineyards of the area, and, therefore, its economy. The decrease in population until this very day has been continuous. In the past, Juan Mart√≠n El Empecinado (The Stubborn one) the famous guerilla who fought against the Napoleonic troops, was imprisoned in Nava de Roa after his capture in Olmos de Pe√±afiel (1823). He was later handed over to the Mayor of Roa de Duero, Gregorio Gonz√°lez. In the end he was executed in 1824. The feast day of San Antol√≠n M√°rtir is celebrated on September 2 and is of major local importance. The feast day of San Gregorio Nacianceno is locally celebrated, on May 9.

Tullius Cicero. De Haruspicum Responsis 13. who was also tetrarch of the Tolistobogii. By Deiotarus' daughter Adobogiona, Brogitarus was the father of Amyntas, tetrarch of the Trocmi and king of Galatia. Cicero claims that Brogitarus obtained his elevation to the kingship of Galatia alongside Deiotarus by bribing P. Clodius Pulcher, who was then tribune of the plebs at Rome. Brogitarus also became high priest of the Great Mother at Pessinus after the incumbent was removed through a law introduced by Clodius Pulcher. Cicero impugns not only this procedure but also Brogitarus' character, claiming that the priesthood \\"was sold for a large sum to Brogitarus, a profligate man, and unworthy of any such sacred character, especially as he had desired it not for the purpose of doing honour to the goddess, but only of profaning her temple.\\"M.

The station stopped broadcasting in May 2006. Towards the end of its tenure, the station's owners applied to the regulators for a local commercial licence, which was awarded to Brunel FM, and for a community radio licence, which went to Swindon 105.5. As a result, many of its staff and presenters moved to those rival stations.  History  =Swindon 107FM (2001‚Äì2002)= Swindon 107FM broadcast its first Restricted Service Licence (RSL) transmission from a studio at Swindon's Brunel Centre shopping complex in September 2001. The station was founded by former Swindon Town chairman Rikki Hunt and jazz musician Ray Butt, who felt a need for new station in the area where GWR FM Wiltshire had for many years been the only commercial station, along with BBC Wiltshire Sound (now BBC Radio Wiltshire). Their target audience was between 25‚Äì55 years and the station played popular artists from the 1950s to the present day that catered for their audience, including local artists with specialist music shows, which the area had been lacking, as well as a local news service. Another RSL transmission was broadcast in June and July 2002, focusing more on local talent to present the station's programming. =Swindon FM (2003‚Äì2006)= In 2003, Swindon FM began broadcasting from new studios at Old Town Court as a DAB-only station ‚Äì the first local station of its kind in the United Kingdom. Swindon FM broadcast at first on Saturdays and Sundays between 6am and 10pm before expanding to a full seven days-a-week service later in the year ‚Äì an event marked by a weekend- long countdown of one hundred songs voted for by the public. Other feature programming on the station included The What's On Guide and The Winning Weekend. The launch of a DAB station (by now, run completely by volunteers) also marked a change in Swindon FM's target audience to 35-years and over, concentrating on the older range of the scale. In 2005, Swindon FM applied to Ofcom for a local FM licence, and at this time GWR-FM's parent company, GCap, invested in a 20% share of Swindon FM. Following a successful campaign to prove there was an audience for a second commercial radio licence for Swindon, Swindon FM ultimately lost out to another group, Now FM (who began broadcasting as Brunel FM and were owned by The Local Radio Company). =Closure= At 2pm on Friday 12 May 2006, the station ceased transmission after running into difficulties with its premises, leaving Swindon FM homeless. At the end of the year, the team behind Swindon FM applied for a Community Radio licence but lost out to Swindon 105.5.

Racing career The colt started five times in 1989, finishing his two-year-old campaign with a record of 3-1-1. His one second-place finish was to stablemate Adjudicating in the Grade I Champagne Stakes. In the most important race of the year for his age group, jockey Craig Perret rode Rhythm to a two-length victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in a year when it was held at Florida's Gulfstream Park. The colt's performances earned him 1989 U.S. Champion 2-Yr-Old Colt honors. In 1990, three-year-old Rhythm made ten starts, winning three times. An increasingly difficult temperament combined with a throat problem that necessitated surgery resulted in the colt's handlers having to skip the U.S. Triple Crown series. By mid summer, Rhythm was getting back in shape and ran second in the Dwyer Stakes and third in both the Woodward Stakes and in the Haskell Invitational Handicap before scoring his most important victory of the year in the prestigious Grade I Travers Stakes.

He entered stud in 1992 at Arrow Stud at Hokkaid≈ç from where he would be shuttled to breeders in New Zealand and Australia before returning to the United States in 1997 to stand at Ashford Stud near Versailles, Kentucky. In 2000, Rhythm was sent to Diamond F Ranch in Grass Valley, California where on September 4, 2007 he is reported to have fractured a leg in a paddock accident and had to be euthanized. As a stallion, Rhythm sired 24 stakes winners. His most successful progeny were in New Zealand and Australia where he was the sire of three Southern Hemisphere champions including the outstanding filly Ethereal whose four Group One wins included three of the most important staying races in Australian racing: the Caulfield Cup, the Melbourne Cup and The BMW Stakes.

Tietgen (1829-1891), is a student residence located in the √òrestad district of Copenhagen, Denmark. The building has a conspicuous circular shape, inspired by traditional southern Chinese Hakka architecture, and is designed by Danish architects Lundgaard & Tranberg in 2006. The design has won it a RIBA European Award. Architecture The round building is seven stories high. Five vertical lines divide the building both visually and functionally into sections and also serve as continuous passages that provide access from outside to the central courtyard and to the different stories. The ground floor has common facilities: a caf√©, auditorium, study and computer rooms, workshops, laundry, music and meeting rooms, and bicycle parking. The apartments are located on the other stories, 12 in each segment. All rooms face the fa√ßade and have a view of the surroundings. The common kitchens/auxiliary rooms, lounges, and terraces are located on the central court, bringing residents together. Its concept focuses on how the accommodation can help encourage the personal and social development of the students. The courtyard, around which all common areas are located, reinforces the idea of community. It also enables the often monotonous student corridor to become not only spatially interesting but unending, linking all student ‚Äòhouses‚Äô on each floor. Rooms There are 360 rooms, 10% of which have been designated for international exchange students. The building is circular, with 7 floors and rooms set up in blocks of 12.

It is owned by the The Hugh Lane, Dublin where it currently hangs. The work is an early example of Manet's painterly style, inspired by Frans Hals and Diego Vel√°zquez, and it is a harbinger of his lifelong interest in the subject of leisure. The painting influenced Manet's contemporaries ‚Äì such as Monet, Renoir and Bazille ‚Äì to paint similar large groups of people. The painting depicts the gatherings of Parisians at weekly concerts in the Tuileries gardens near the Louvre, although no musicians are depicted. While the picture was regarded as unfinished by some, the suggested atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at the time; one may imagine the music and conversation. The iron chairs in the foreground had just replaced the wooden chairs in the garden in 1862. Manet has included several of his friends, artists, authors, and musicians who take part, and a self-portrait. Manet is depicted on the far left; next to him is another painter Albert de Balleroy. To their right, seated, is sculptor and critic Zacharie Astruc. Manet's brother Eug√®ne Manet is in foreground, right of centre, with white trousers; the composer Jacques Offenbach with glasses and moustache sits against a tree to the right; critic Th√©ophile Gautier stands against a tree in brown suit and full beard, while author Charles Baudelaire is to the left of Gautier. Henri Fantin-Latour is further left, with beard, looking at the viewer. The fair-haired child in the centre is L√©on Leenhoff. The work measures . It was first exhibited in 1863, and Manet sold the painting to opera singer and collector Jean-Baptiste Faure in 1883. It was sold on to dealer Durand-Ruel in 1898, and then to collector Sir Hugh Lane in 1903. After Lane's death, when RMS Lusitania was sunk in 1915, an unwitnessed codicil to his will left the painting to the Dublin City Gallery (now known as The Hugh Lane). The codicil was found to be invalid, and in 1917 a court case decided that his previous will left the work to the National Gallery in London. After intervention from the Irish government, the two galleries reached a compromise in 1959, agreeing to share the paintings, with half of the Lane Bequest lent and shown in Dublin every five years. The agreement was varied in 1993 so that 31 of the 39 paintings would stay in Ireland, and four of the remaining eight would be lent to Dublin for 6 years at a time. Painting materials The colors in greater areas of this painting are generally subdued and executed in ochres or in mixtures of several pigments. The dark green foliage in the upper part contains a glaze of emerald green and Scheele's green mixed with yellow lake with small addition of ivory black and yellow ochre. The strong colourful accents in the bonnets and clothes of the children are painted in almost pure pigments such as cobalt blue, vermilion or chrome orange.Bomford D, Kirby J, Leighton, J., Roy A.

The cabin console Airborne Real-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance, also known by the acronym ARCHER, is an aerial imaging system that produces ground images far more detailed than plain sight or ordinary aerial photography can. It is the most sophisticated unclassified hyperspectral imaging system available, according to U.S. Government officials. ARCHER can automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the object being sought (such as a missing aircraft), for abnormalities in the surrounding area, or for changes from previous recorded spectral signatures. It has direct applications for search and rescue, counterdrug, disaster relief and impact assessment, and homeland security, and has been deployed by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in the US on the Australian- built Gippsland GA8 Airvan fixed-wing aircraft. CAP, the civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force, is a volunteer education and public-service non- profit organization that conducts aircraft search and rescue in the US.  Overview  ARCHER is a daytime non-invasive technology, which works by analyzing an object‚Äôs reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal in the belly of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500 feet (800 meters) and 100 knots (50 meters/second) ground speed. The system software was developed by Space Computer Corporation of Los Angeles and the system hardware is supplied by NovaSol Corp. of Honolulu, Hawaii specifically for CAP. The ARCHER system is based on hyperspectral technology research and testing previously undertaken by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). CAP developed ARCHER in cooperation with the NRL, AFRL and the United States Coast Guard Research & Development Center in the largest interagency project CAP has undertaken in its 74-year history. Since 2003, almost US$5 million authorized under the 2002 Defense Appropriations Act has been spent on development and deployment. , CAP reported completing the initial deployment of 16 aircraft throughout the U.S. and training over 100 operators, but had only used the system on a few search and rescue missions, and had not credited it with being the first to find any wreckage. In searches in Georgia and Maryland during 2007, ARCHER located the aircraft wreckage, but both accidents had no survivors, according to Col. Drew Alexa, director of advanced technology, and the ARCHER program manager at CAP. An ARCHER equipped aircraft from the Utah Wing of the Civil Air Patrol was used in the search for adventurer Steve Fossett in September 2007. ARCHER did not locate Mr. Fossett, but was instrumental in uncovering eight previously uncharted crash sites in the high desert area of Nevada, some decades old. Col. Alexa described the system to the press in 2007: \\"The human eye sees basically three bands of light. The ARCHER sensor sees 50. It can see things that are anomalous in the vegetation such as metal or something from an airplane wreckage.\\" Major Cynthia Ryan of the Nevada Civil Air Patrol, while also describing the system to the press in 2007, stated, \\"ARCHER is essentially something used by the geosciences. It's pretty sophisticated stuff ‚Ä¶ beyond what the human eye can generally see,\\" She elaborated further, \\"It might see boulders, it might see trees, it might see mountains, sagebrush, whatever, but it goes 'not that' or 'yes, that'. The amazing part of this is that it can see as little as 10 per cent of the target, and extrapolate from there.\\" In addition to the primary search and rescue mission, CAP has tested additional uses for ARCHER. For example, an ARCHER equipped CAP GA8 was used in a pilot project in Missouri in August 2005 to assess the suitability of the system for tracking hazardous material releases into the environment, and one was deployed to track oil spills in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita in Texas during September 2005. Since then, in the case of a flight originating in Missouri, the ARCHER system proved its usefulness in October 2006, when it found the wreckage in Antlers, Okla. The National Transportation and Safety Board was extremely pleased with the data ARCHER provided, which was later used to locate aircraft debris spread over miles of rough, wooded terrain. In July 2007, the ARCHER system identified a flood-borne oil spill originating in a Kansas oil refinery, that extended downstream and had invaded previously unsuspected reservoir areas.2007 Civil Air Patrol Annual Report to Congress The client agencies (EPA, Coast Guard, and other federal and state agencies) found the data essential to quick remediation. In September 2008, a Civil Air Patrol GA-8 from Texas Wing searched for a missing aircraft from Arkansas. It was found in Oklahoma, identified simultaneously by ground searchers and the overflying ARCHER system. Rather than a direct find, this was a validation of the system's accuracy and efficacy. In the subsequent recovery, it was found that the ARCHER plotted the debris area with great accuracy.  Technical description  The major ARCHER subsystem components include: * advanced hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system with a resolution of one square meter per pixel. * panchromatic high-resolution imaging (HRI) camera with a resolution of 8 cm x 8 cm (3 in x 3 in) per pixel. * global positioning system (GPS) integrated with an inertial navigation system (INS) = Hyperspectral imager = The passive hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy remote sensor observes a target in multi-spectral bands. The HSI camera separates the image spectra into 52 \\"bins\\" from 500 nanometers (nm) wavelength at the blue end of the visible spectrum to 1100 nm in the infrared, giving the camera a spectral resolution of 11.5 nm. Although ARCHER records data in all 52 bands, the computational algorithms only use the first 40 bands, from 500 nm to 960 nm because the bands above 960 nm are too noisy to be useful. For comparison, the normal human eye will respond to wavelengths from approximately 400 to 700 nm, and is trichromatic, meaning the eye's cone cells only sense light in three spectral bands. As the ARCHER aircraft flies over a search area, reflected sunlight is collected by the HSI camera lens. The collected light passes through a set of lenses that focus the light to form an image of the ground. The imaging system uses a pushbroom approach to image acquisition. With the pushbroom approach, the focusing slit reduces the image height to the equivalent of one vertical pixel, creating a horizontal line image. The horizontal line image is then projected onto a diffraction grating, which is a very finely etched reflecting surface that disperses light into its spectra. The diffraction grating is specially constructed and positioned to create a two-dimensional (2D) spectrum image from the horizontal line image. The spectra are projected vertically, i.e., perpendicular to the line image, by the design and arrangement of the diffraction grating. The 2D spectrum image projects onto a charge-coupled device (CCD) two-dimensional image sensor, which is aligned so that the horizontal pixels are parallel to the image's horizontal. As a result, the vertical pixels are coincident to the spectra produced from the diffraction grating. Each column of pixels receives the spectrum of one horizontal pixel from the original image. The arrangement of vertical pixel sensors in the CCD divides the spectrum into distinct and non-overlapping intervals. The CCD output consists of electrical signals for 52 spectral bands for each of 504 horizontal image pixels. The on-board computer records the CCD output signal at a frame rate of sixty times each second. At an aircraft altitude of 2,500 ft AGL and a speed of 100 knots, a 60 Hz frame rate equates to a ground image resolution of approximately one square meter per pixel. Thus, every frame captured from the CCD contains the spectral data for a ground swath that is approximately one meter long and 500 meters wide. = High-resolution imager = A high-resolution imaging (HRI) black-and-white, or panchromatic, camera is mounted adjacent to the HSI camera to enable both cameras to capture the same reflected light. The HRI camera uses a pushbroom approach just like the HSI camera with a similar lens and slit arrangement to limit the incoming light to a thin, wide beam. However, the HRI camera does not have a diffraction grating to disperse the incoming reflected light. Instead, the light is directed to a wider CCD to capture more image data. Because it captures a single line of the ground image per frame, it is called a line scan camera. The HRI CCD is 6,144 pixels wide and one pixel high. It operates at a frame rate of 720 Hz. At ARCHER search speed and altitude (100 knots over the ground at 2,500 ft AGL) each pixel in the black-and-white image represents a 3 inch by 3 inch area of the ground. This high resolution adds the capability to identify some objects. = Processing = A monitor in the cockpit displays detailed images in real time, and the system also logs the image and Global Positioning System data at a rate of 30 gigabytes (GB) per hour for later analysis. The on-board data processing system performs numerous real-time processing functions including data acquisition and recording, raw data correction, target detection, cueing and chipping, precision image geo- registration, and display and dissemination of image products and target cue information. ARCHER has three methods for locating targets: * signature matching where reflected light is matched to spectral signatures * anomaly detection using a statistical model of the pixels in the image to determine the probability that a pixel does not match the profile, and * change detection which executes a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the current image against ground conditions that were obtained in a previous mission over the same area. In change detection, scene changes are identified, and new, moved or departed targets are highlighted for evaluation. In spectral signature matching, the system can be programmed with the parameters of a missing aircraft, such as paint colors, to alert the operators of possible wreckage. It can also be used to look for specific materials, such as petroleum products or other chemicals released into the environment, or even ordinary items like commonly available blue polyethylene tarpaulins. In an impact assessment role, information on the location of blue tarps used to temporarily repair buildings damaged in a storm can help direct disaster relief efforts; in a counterdrug role, a blue tarp located in a remote area could be associated with illegal activity.

The need for CPF All concretes cast against wood or steel in the concrete cover zone, have a reduced cement content and increased water/cement ratio (i.e. less dense and more porous) compared to concrete located beyond the reinforcement. Within the core of any structural element the matrix is generally a denser and of better quality compared to the surface as a direct result of the concrete compaction. This compaction process drives excess mix air and water within the cover zone towards the formed surfaces. As conventional wood or steel formwork is impermeable, the migration within the mix ceases as the concrete/formwork interface is reached. Visually, this may be observed on all concrete surfaces through the presence of blowholes following formwork removal. This is a problem because the first line of defence of all structural elements against carbonatation, chlorides, frost and abrasion, is the cover zone. It is therefore imperative this region is durable. CPF liners CPF liners are typically constructed of 100% polypropylene fibres, spun and thermally bonded, with a woven texture of 0.7 mm thickness. Some systems may be laminated to a plastic latticed net to ensure drainage whilst providing stiffness to the liner. They are robust and chemically inert and may be supplied in rolls of varying length to construction sites. Basic elements of CPF systems The basic elements of CPF systems are: * Filter - to allow the passage of water and air away from the fresh concrete but retain cement and other fine solids. * Drain - which transfers air and water from the filter to outside the formwork. * Structural support - this is the formwork which supports the filter and drainage elements and also maintains the required formwork profile and resists the concrete pressure, commonly plywood/structural timber. How cpf liners work CPF liners are secured in place on vertical or inclined surfaces with staples or other fixing devices, having first been tensioned onto the formwork shuttering. Once attached, concreting is performed in the normal way. Release agents are not required as CPF liners easily debond from the concrete during formwork striking. Throughout the concreting process and as a result of concrete pressures, entrapped air and excess mix water that would otherwise become trapped at the surface causing blemishes, can instead pass through the liner. A proportion of this mix water is held within the liner and under capillary action, imbibes back into the concrete to assist curing. Liners generally have a pore structure that is designed to retain the majority of cement and other small fines. This results (for vertical and inclined surfaces) in the creation of a uniform surface relatively free from blowholes and other surface blemishes when compared to impermeable concrete. But more importantly the achievement of a cover area with significantly enhanced durability.

Its status is Endangered, with a wild population of 3,500 animals, and it can be found on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy The Andros Island iguana, Cyclura cychlura cychlura, is endemic to the island of Andros. It is one of three subspecies of the Northern Bahamian rock iguana; the other two subspecies being Allen's Cay iguana (Cyclura cychlura inornata) and the Exuma Island iguana (Cyclura cychlura figginsi). Anatomy and morphology The Andros Island iguana is one of the largest species of rock iguana which attains a total length of close to . Its coloration is dark-gray to black, with yellowish green or orange tinged scales on the legs, dorsal crest, and the head. When the animal matures, the yellow coloration changes to a bright reddish orange color in contrast to the animals darker striped body and black feet. This species, like other species of Cyclura, is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. Ecology Andros Island iguanas are host to a reptile tick, Amblyomma dissimile. Diet Like all Cyclura species, the Andros Island iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 100 different plant species. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, rats, and fungi. Reproduction Mating occurs from early April to early May, with eggs deposited in nests excavated within termite mounds (Nasutitermes rippertii). This is the only species of iguana known to use termite mounds as a means of incubating its eggs. Females are known to guard their nests until hatching occurs. The newly hatched iguanas disperse away from the nest site for the first two or three weeks. During the first week, the hatchlings are vulnerable to predation by snakes; less than one-third of hatchlings survive their first month. Conservation =Endangered Status= It is estimated that the current global population is less than 3,500 members and is declining. The population has decreased by at least 50% over the last 60 years. =Causes of decline= Hunting is the main factor threatening imminent extinction for this iguana. It is the only Caribbean species of iguana which is still regularly hunted for food for human consumption. Feral pigs pose a threat to the iguanas, as they dig up eggs from iguana nests within termite mounds. Feral and domestic dogs prey upon juvenile and adult iguanas as well. Feral goats have also been known to compete with the iguanas for food. As with other rock iguanas, their habitat is in rapid decline due to development and logging. =Recovery efforts= Like all Bahamian rock iguanas, this species is protected in the Bahamas under the Wild Animals Protection Act of 1968.

She was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in 1895, launched in March 1897, and commissioned into the German fleet in February 1899. She was named after Princess Victoria Louise, the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The ship was armed with a battery of two 21 cm guns and eight 15 cm guns and had a top speed of . Victoria Louise served with the fleet for the first seven years of her career. During this time, she represented Germany during the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. In 1906, she was modernized and after 1908, used as a training ship for naval cadets. In 1909, she visited the United States, and at the outbreak of World War I, was mobilized into V Scouting Group. She was attacked unsuccessfully by the British submarine in October 1914, and at the end of the year she was withdrawn from service. She was used as a minelayer and barracks ship based in Danzig for the rest of the war. Victoria Louise was sold in 1919 and converted into a freighter the following year, though she served in this capacity until 1923, when she was broken up for scrap. Design Line-drawing of the Victoria Louise class In the early 1890s, elements in the German naval command structure grappled with what type of cruiser ought to be built to fulfill the various needs of the fleet. The Reichsmarineamt (RMA‚ÄîImperial Navy Office) preferred to build a combination of large cruisers of around along the lines of and significantly smaller vessels of about to support them, while the Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command) argued that a uniform force of cruisers was preferable. In the event, the RMA carried the day and three 6,000-ton cruisers were authorized in 1895. They resembled the larger s, designed at the same time, albeit at reduced scale. Victoria Louise was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. As designed, she displaced , and at full load, her displacement rose to . Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4-cylinder triple- expansion steam engines, each driving a single screw propeller, with steam provided by twelve coal-fired D√ºrr boilers. Her engines were rated for , and provided a top speed of . The ship had a range of approximately at . She had a crew of 31 officers and 446 enlisted men. The ship was armed with two SK L/40 guns in single gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns were supplied with 58 rounds of ammunition each, and they had a range of . Victoria Louise also carried eight SK L/40 guns. Four were mounted in single turrets amidships and the other four were placed in casemates in the main deck, two abreast the conning tower and the others abreast the mainmast. These guns had a range of . For defense against torpedo boats, she carried ten guns. The gun armament was rounded out by machine guns. She was also equipped with three torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes, two launchers were mounted on the broadside and the third was in the bow, all below the waterline. The ship was protected with Krupp armor; their deck was on the horizontal with sloped sides that were thick. Her main and secondary battery turrets had 10 cm thick sides and the secondary casemates had the same level of protection. The conning tower had 15 cm thick sides. Service history Victoria Louise during visit to US in 1909 Postcard of Victoria Louise Victoria Louise at some point before 1904 Victoria Louise was ordered under the contract name \\"L\\" and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1895. She was launched on 29 March 1897, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 20 February 1899. Victoria Louise joined the squadron, commanded by Prince Heinrich, that went to Britain to participate in the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. Along with Victoria Louise, , , and represented Germany at Spithead. In 1902, Victoria Louise was assigned to the Cruiser Division of the I Squadron of the German home fleet. The Division consisted of the armored cruiser , the flagship, , and the light cruisers , , and . The Division participated in the summer fleet maneuvers of August-September 1902. In 1906, the ship went into dock for modernization in the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. After emerging from the drydock in 1908, Victoria Louise served as a training ship for naval cadets and cabin boys. In September-October 1909, Victoria Louise, , , and traveled to the United States to represent Germany during the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration. In 1912, Theodor Krancke served aboard the ship as a cadet; he would go on to command the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer in World War II. She served as a school ship until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. She was briefly mobilized into V Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea. Shortly after 0900 on 17 October, the British submarine , commanded by Noel Laurence, attempted to torpedo Victoria Louise at a range of . The torpedo ran too deep, however, and missed. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service. She was put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a minelayer and barracks ship in Danzig. In 1916, Victoria Louise was disarmed. She remained in service in Danzig until 1 October 1919, when she was stricken from the naval register. She was sold to the Norddeutscher Tiefbau company and rebuilt in 1920 into a freighter. She was renamed Flora Sommerfeld and operated by Danziger Hoch- und Tiefbau GmbH. She served in this capacity only briefly; she was broken up for scrap in 1923 in Danzig.

Career Visaroff started his career on stage: In July 1922, Visaroff came to the United States with a group from the Kamerny Theatre in Moscow. With a 14-week leave of absence from Russia, the group planned to present 12 plays, each lasting one week, in a Broadway theater. He eventually made the transition to film, appearing in 113 films between 1925 and 1952.

The series is Nickelodeon Animation Studio‚Äôs first animated series to be based on a web series, and follows the evil Vendetta and the new happy but dim-witted girl, Charlotte, at school in the gloomy town of Clamburg. Vendetta hates Charlotte and tries to destroy her in each and every episode. The series is created by Amy Winfrey and produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio, with Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited animating the show in traditional 2D animation. Winfrey voices Charlotte and her grandmother Charlene, among other characters. Character designer Aglaia Mortcheva is the voice of Vendetta. All of the voice actors from the web cartoon reprise their roles for the TV series, with the addition of a new cast member and crew member, Dave Wasson, who previously created Time Squad for Cartoon Network. The series premiered with no promotion or press release. At one point, it was the highest-rated original program on Nicktoons. The show was abruptly cancelled after airing six episodes due to the poor ratings. The show continued airing on Nicktoons for reruns until October 2016. Plot (l-r); Grudge, Vendetta, Marvin, Maggie, Mort, Charlotte, Marion, Malachi, and Mr. Milk. Vendetta is a selfish green little girl with the power to make fiends, \\"hideous things\\" which she has unleashed on her town to bring it under her reign of terror. The coastal town of Clamburg, once a thriving tourist destination, has become a grim, forbidding place, with stores shuttered and the populace cowed before the horror of Vendetta's watchful fiends. Charlotte, a new girl at Vendetta's school, arrives determined to make a friend. An \\"impossibly cheery\\" optimist, Charlotte rapidly becomes the foil and tormentor of the morose and vindictive Vendetta, by insisting on befriending her. Vendetta is unable to elicit anything but saccharine friendliness out of Charlotte, and so makes the first of many fiends that are specially designed to \\"destroy\\" the newcomer. After demonstrating that her oblivious joy makes her immune to the dangers and terrors of all of the fiends, Charlotte declares that she and Vendetta are \\"going to be best friends forever and ever.\\" In subsequent scenes, Charlotte displays an ability to change the nature of some fiends into helpful friends, further frustrating Vendetta's efforts to undo her. Being \\"oblivious to all that is bad and mean in the world\\", Charlotte neither acknowledges the damage caused by Vendetta's fiends, nor the threat Vendetta herself poses over Clamburg. Nearly all of the residents, including Vendetta's parents, come to hate or fear Charlotte more than they do Vendetta within the first six episodes. Charlotte never discovers or understands that Vendetta despises her, and Vendetta is never able to get rid of Charlotte. While this conflict is never resolved by the end of each episode, some minor developments appear to continue between episodes, like the introduction of Buttons 2 and an enormous statue that Vendetta has raised of herself. Characters Vendetta and Charlotte attend Mu Elementary School in class room 4. Mr. Milk, a soft-spoken nervous man, is their teacher. Charlotte lives with her grandmother Charlene. Charlotte's parents are said to be astronauts, but are likely dead. Vendetta lives with her shrunk down parents, Violetta and Viktor, who live in a hamster cage. They all live in the mysterious and gloomy town of Clamburg. Vendetta closed stores she does not like, such as a model toy store. Nearby cities are called Tinspit (which is mentioned by Vendetta to have miniature golf) and Molding. They eat clams, beef jerky, grape punch, and many onions, including onion soda. The town is coastal and was in the past famous for its clams. Before Vendetta came with her fiends, Clamburg was apparently a happy place, as shown in a commercial. It had beaches, happy inhabitants, a thriving clam industry, and a polka music festival. Fiends Vendetta makes the fiends through a process similar to baking, mixing together ingredients to form them. Vendetta seems to be the only one in Clamburg who knows how to make fiends, although in one episode Charlotte was able to make a friendly fiend without help from Vendetta. (Vendetta only gave her the ingredients.) Vendetta gets her fiend recipes from a large green cookbook labeled \\"How to make Fiends\\". The base ingredient is a colorless powder, or liquid, called \\"Fiend Mix\\" and spiders. Though Vendetta has been shown in episodes such as \\"Puppies, Puppies, Puppies!\\" to be able to make simple fiends from only fiend mix, more complicated ingredients are needed to make fiends with more potential. Adding any ingredient that doesn't fit can make the fiend come out entirely wrong, as shown in the promo clip \\"Ralph\\" and in the episode \\"Parentnapped\\". There are many fiends that take prominent roles in the show (see Characters), but many fiends are only shown in one or two episodes before disappearing forever. Many fiends were taken from the online series, such as in the episode \\"Marvin the Middle Manager\\"; the \\"library fiends\\" were previously \\"noise-making fiends\\" shown in web episode 16. Charlotte can manipulate fiends very easily. It has been shown in many episodes that giving fiends sugar of any kind, or sometimes even just showing them affection, can make them turn benevolent. It is unknown whether this is a flaw present in all fiends, a mistake Vendetta repeats by accident, or some unspoken power of Charlotte's. Most fiends Vendetta creates only have one purpose, and seem only capable of doing one thing. It is unknown if it is just because a lack of intelligence, if Vendetta only surrounds them with one thing to do, or if it is in the ingredients. Grudge, however, is a more complicated fiend who does anything Vendetta asks. =Origins= Winfrey is often asked where she got the idea for Making Fiends. She is not sure, but liked to sketch \\"strange and fantastical\\" animals in college. She is often inspired by \\"silly-looking and improbable\\" animals. She has a parrot and a pet flounder at home, and once had a salamander. Music Series creator Amy Winfrey wrote all of the songs featured on the show. After recording the demo track for each song, they would be sent to series composer, Ego Plum, for production. Plum is noted for using unusual sounds and instruments in his music. Examples include: dripping water, toy pianos, baby rattles, plastic xylophones, and even a goat. On occasion, other Making Fiends crew members would pitch in to help play the various instruments, lending the music a \\"home-made\\" feel similar to the original web series. Production A daughter to an employee at Nickelodeon was a fan of Making Fiends. She showed the website to other Nickelodeon employees. They contacted Winfrey to see if she was interested in televising the series. In early 2004, Nick started negotiations with Winfrey to develop the series into a half-hour television program. During the long negotiation and development period, Winfrey continued to create new web episodes independently, and sell related merchandise in her own online \\"souvenir shop\\". In 2006, Nickelodeon began distributing many of the web cartoons as streaming video on their own TurboNick platform, and later as podcasts available on iTunes. The series was picked up for a first season of television episodes in late 2006. Production began in January 2007 and the show started airing in 2008. The show was set to premiere on Nickelodeon, but Nickelodeon decided to cancel its plans for a broadcast on their parent channel, and instead gave this new series to its sister channel Nicktoons (along with the show, Random! Cartoons). The series premiered on October 4, 2008 and ended on November 1, the same year. The show aired on Saturdays and Sundays at 11:30am and 9:30pm. It received generally favorable reviews by critics. Making Fiends carries a rating of TV-Y7 (FV - fantasy violence for some episodes). The series aired in the US, Australia and New Zealand, and in the Netherlands. The writing team of Making Fiends consisted of only four people; Winfrey, Peter Merryman, Madellaine Paxson, and Matt Negrete. In the show's studio, there was a special \\"thinking couch\\" for the development of new ideas. Charlotte's house in the web series (top) and in the TV series (bottom). =Animation= Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited animate the series in traditional 2-D. The character designs are kept from the web series, with some changed details; such as cleaner lines and brighter eyes. Despite the fact that both versions use Adobe Flash to create animation, the television episodes are cleaner-looking. This is probably because the characters and backgrounds in the web episodes were made of overlapping JPEG files, and that the television series has an actual budget. Also, the colors still go outside the outlines, but it seems more like a second outline than messy drawing. Every building was changed; in the web cartoon most buildings were grey, but were changed to different colors for the TV version. Vendetta's house is now dark green and Charlotte's blue. =Cast= Creator Amy Winfrey voices Charlotte, Grandma Charlene, Giant Kitty, Marion, Maggie, Buttons, and Mrs. Millet. Character designer Aglaia Mortcheva, who also was in the crew for the web series, voices Vendetta and her mother, Violeta. Winfrey's husband, Peter Merryman, voices Mr. Milk, Marvin, Malachi, Grudge, Mort, Ms. Minty, Onion Man, and most fiends on the show. The series' supervising producer and director, Dave Wasson, voices Vendetta's father, Viktor, and Mr. Gumpit. Madellaine Paxson voiced Maggie in the episode \\"No Singing\\". Winfrey, however, voices Maggie in all other appearances. Episodes Reception =Reviews= Dell Antonia at Common Sense Media gave the show 4 out of 5 saying \\"the dialogue is simple, the animation is intentionally scribbly and dark, and the color palette is limited. The whole thing looks like a kid's flip book. And yet it's funny -- funny for the kind of parents who think Dexter's Laboratory is funny, and funny for any kid old enough to handle the weirdness of rooting for a patently bad girl who will never win and with nothing but a secret, lingering fear of monsters under the bed.\\" Dan Heching at Tilzy said \\"clever and irreverent, Making Fiends is a fairly classic series of short episodes. [...] Nothing is left untouched; torture, animal attacks, musical numbers and April fools' jokes. [...] Character development is kept largely to a minimum, in keeping with the classic simplicity of the cartoon, [that is] Vendetta vs. Charlotte.\\" =Marketing and merchandise= Before the series was picked up by Nicktoons, Winfrey sold Making Fiends T-shirts and DVDs with the web episodes at her \\"souvenir shop\\". Official t-shirts by Nicktoons were later released. A 2-disc complete series DVD set was released on June 9, 2009 with the first season including all six episodes. Although it is shown in the gift shop at the Making Fiends official website, it is only available for purchase at Amazon.com in DVD-R format. The entire series is also available for digital purchase at Amazon's Prime Video.

According to the 2004 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 33 inhabitants. Geography In the corridor of La Bureba, 2 on the left bank of the Cerrat√≥n River , next to the towns of Monasterio and Quintanavides and enclosed by the route of the AP-1 that acts as a barrier together with the NI and the railway in its expansion waters up towards Santa Mar√≠a . Topography The name of the locality, Santa Olaja, means \\"Santa Olalla or Eulalia\\". There are two other towns of the same name in the provinces of Le√≥n and Palencia . History Constitution Square, Santa Olalla de Bureba. The village of Santa Olalla de Bureba is located at the foot of La Br√∫jula and bathed by the Ebro, although in a part of its term, which borders Caborredondo, flows into the River Douro. It owes its name to Saint Eulalia, a young woman who deserved the glory of martyrdom during the persecution of Diocletian at the beginning of the 4th century. The body of the saint was taken to Asturias in the wake of the Arab invasion and then guarded with all veneration in Oviedo, extending its devotion throughout the north of Spain in the centuries altomedievales. When the foramontanos arrived at these lands the group that founded this town, probably in the ninth century, after the foundation of Burgos (year 884), brought some relic of the saint and hence the name of the new town. The Latin name of Eulalia is Olalla, and it was called Bureba to distinguish them from other populations that had the same name. The first written mention that makes reference to Santa Olalla de Bureba dates back to the year 1011, when Don Sancho I cites it in the founding document of the Monastery of San Salvador de O√±a. The count of the Good Fueros, as he was known, made his daughter Tigridia abbess and lady of the same and gave to the monastery the half of the property that it owned in Santa Olalla de Bureba. One hundred years later there is evidence of the existence of another villa, Villasuso, in the current term of Santa Olalla, located in a payment that still maintains the same name. On the other hand, a powerful lady named Dona Estefan√≠a donates her property to the Monastery of O√±a, property including the haciendas she owned in Villasuso. Later Santa Olalla de Bureba absorbs Villasuso with its neighbors and territory. Years later, in 1146, Emperor Alfonso VII granted the town of Cerezo de R√≠o Tir√≥n a charter whose articles extended to a long list of villas, including Santa Olalla de Bureba. The benefits of the law were mainly related to the administration of justice, the exemption of some taxes and the obtaining of some privileges of pasture, portazgo and pontazgo. During the medieval and modern times the population of Santa Olalla de Bureba was not high; in century XIII it appears in the relation of loans of the diocese of Burgos with 13 maravedises, which supposes that its population did not happen of a hundred inhabitants. Already in the year 1591 the population had doubled; whereas in the year 1843 it has 144 inhabitants. Their neighbors lived on the exploitation of their flax crops and a jasper quarry. Also, already in the eighteenth century, when Santa Olalla de Bureba appears in the Pr√°danos group, one of the seven in which the Bureba was divided, they began to take advantage of the Camino Real from Madrid to France. In the 19th century, the railroad arrived and, halfway through the century, the single-track train from Madrid to Paris already operated. In the twentieth century the term of Santa Olalla de Bureba is an obligatory step of all service networks between the upper plateau, the Ebro Valley and Europe, so by its municipal district-geography-passes a gas pipeline, an oil pipeline , the National Highway I, the railroad, the Burgos-M√°lzaga highway, the Camino de Santiago, the Quintanavides highway ... This service capacity has benefited the town of Santa Olalla de Bureba very much economically and socially, which, on the other hand, It has also suffered a large population decline due to industrial evolution.

Melville cited his opposition to the Vietnam War and U.S. imperialism as the motivation for the bombings. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to bombing the Federal Office Building in lower Manhattan, as well as to assaulting a marshal in a failed escape attempt. A key figure in the 1971 Attica Prison riots, he was shot and killed when the uprising was put down by force. Early life Sam Melville (a name borrowed from author Herman Melville) was born to Dorothy and William Grossman in 1934 in New York City. Dorothy left William and moved with Sam back to her hometown of Tonawanda, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. Melville lost sight in one eye at a young age because of a flying cinder. He claimed to have had a rough childhood because of his mother's series of alcoholic and abusive boyfriends. He left home and moved to Buffalo as a teenager, making his living as a bowling alley pinsetter. Melville later met his father, who had come to Western New York to look for him. His father convinced him to move back to New York City, finish his high school education and pursue his passion for singing. Back in New York, Melville completed high school, studied singing, found employment as a draftsman, got married and started a family. Politics Melville enjoyed his job but hated the company he worked for. When he was ordered to work on a project for Chase Manhattan Bank designing new offices in the then apartheid based Union of South Africa, Melville became outraged and quit his job. This contributed to a rift and eventual estrangement from his wife and child. Melville survived on odd jobs, including working for The National Guardian, a leftist weekly newspaper published in New York City. He joined various groups in opposition to the Vietnam War, became familiar with social issues, and met many radical activists. Melville became interested in the story of George Metesky, who had terrorized the city with 37 bombings of theaters, terminals, libraries and offices between 1940 and 1956 and was then in a state mental hospital. Melville began writing \\"George Metesky Was Here\\" on buildings around the city. Bombings Melville was responsible for, or connected to, at least the following bombings, all of them in 1969. The majority were preceded by telephone calls warning building security personnel and featured simultaneous political communiques to the press. Although most explosions were timed for late-night hours, the bombing of the Marine Midland Building resulted in 19 injuries. * Jul. 27, Grace Pier, owned by United Fruit Company * Aug. 20, Marine Midland Building * Sep. 19, Federal Office Building on Federal Plaza, offices of the Department of Commerce and the Army Inspector General * Oct. 7, Army Induction Center on Whitehall Street * Nov. 11, Standard Oil offices in the RCA Building * Nov. 11, Chase Manhattan Bank headquarters offices * Nov. 11, General Motors Building * Nov. 12, New York City Criminal Courts Building on Center Street, where the Panther 21 trial was being held. Accomplices Melville had met and become romantically involved with Jane Alpert, a recent graduate from Swarthmore College, while she was enrolled in a graduate program in journalism at Columbia University. The pair were also close with Pat Swinton and Dave Hughey who assisted them with several bombings. Other members of their group were never identified. Melville and Alpert became increasingly involved with the Weather Underground and the Black Panther Party. Arrest and charges In New York City, Melville had been working with a well known radical activist group known as \\"The Crazies\\". One of their members, George Demmerle, was an FBI informant who assisted in the gathering of evidence and apprehension of the group.\\"Crazies: Roz Payne Sixties Archive\\" On November 12, 1969, hours after the Criminal Courts Building bombing, police arrested Melville and Demmerle as they placed dynamite charges in National Guard trucks parked outside the 69th Regimental Armory at 26th Street and Lexington Avenue. Alpert and Hughey were arrested shortly thereafter. Escape attempt On March 7, 1970 Melville overpowered an unarmed marshal at the Federal Courthouse and tried to escape. During a conference with his attorney on a Saturday, when the building was almost deserted, he jumped the marshal, knocked him down and tied him up with his own belt before running out of the room and down a stairway. Melville was recaptured by an armed marshal on a landing two floors below. Imprisonment and death at Attica Melville was eventually transferred to Attica Prison, in Western New York. There, he began an underground publication, Iced Pig, and began to organize the prison population to fight for better conditions. Melville, Elliott Barkley, and Tommy Hicks are thought to be among the principal organizers of the Attica Prison riots in September 1971. Melville, 28 other inmates, and 10 hostages were shot and killed by state police on September 13, when the uprising was put down by order of Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Legacy A book was published with the letters he wrote from prison, Letters From Attica, with a foreword by William Kunstler, and additional contributions by Jane Alpert and John Cohen. On the basis of the text of a letter he wrote on May 16, 1971, Frederic Rzewski wrote a musical composition, '. The text used is On August 28, 2000, a Federal judge awarded $8 million to the survivors of the Attica riots. The son of Sam Melville, Josh Melville, was awarded $25,000.

It was the eighth of the thirteen cartoons in the series to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. The plotline and title of the short is a parody of the 1851 novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. Plot In a 19th-century whaling harbor, the peg-legged captain of the Komquot is obsessed with catching the great white whale, Dicky Moe, to the point of drawing cuts of meat on Dicky Moe's picture, then eating the paper out of insanity. His obsession frightens his crew so badly that they all desert the ship in fear, angering the captain for their cowardly behavior. Shortly afterward, the captain finds Tom searching for food in the harbor, knocks him out and takes him aboard. Tom thinks at first that he is going on a cruise, and sets himself up with a chaise longue and a drink, but the captain almost immediately slams him out of it and forces him to work scrubbing the deck. As Tom works, he sees Jerry set up a beach chair outside his hole. He grabs Jerry and scrubs away all his colors, leaving the mouse visible only as an outline. Jerry returns to his hole to get his colors back, switches Tom's water bucket for one filled with tar and tricks him into scrubbing the deck with it. Tom chases Jerry across the deck, only to get the entire bucket of tar dumped on him from head to toe; he briefly poses as the captain's shadow to avoid being spotted and attacked, then gets wiped clean when the captain slams a door open, smashing him into the wall. Next Tom spots Jerry lounging in the rigging; he goes mad and begins (or tries) to shake him loose by undoing the knots. One of the heavy blocks swings loose and knocks Tom into a barrel of harpoons, leaving his nose stuck in one of them as the captain grabs it. Enraged, the captain pulls every which way and finally throws the harpoon for target practice, finally dislodging Tom. Jerry tricks Tom into stabbing his own tail with the harpoon thinking it is a white mouse. Tom sets a trap with a dangling anvil; Jerry comes, but spots the trap and switches Tom's bait (a piece of cheese) with a fish to mess with him. Tom dives for the fish, but the anvil drops on his own head, sending Tom crashing through the ship's hull and into the ocean. With the help of a rope thrown by Jerry, Tom climbs back on board just as the captain sights Dicky Moe and fires a harpoon gun at him, and the rope flies up. Tom realizes too late that he is holding the free end of the harpoon's rope and therefore gets yanked off the ship. As the whale swims off with Tom tied to him by the rope, weakly screaming \\"Help\\", the captain shouts for him to \\"COME BACK WITH MY WHALE!!!\\" In his hole, Jerry settles down with a book and reads it, scoffing at the situation.

The short is a reworking of a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon, Betty Boop for President, and depicts what Popeye imagines the world would be like if Olive Oyl were president. Synopsis The downtown streets of Popeye and Olive Oyl's town are flooded with crowds who have turned out to hear various presidential candidates trying to convince voters to elect them to the White House. Olive wonders aloud why no women are running for president, to which Popeye replies, \\"because they're too busy runnin' fer huskbands!\\" Undaunted, Olive is certain what the United States needs is a female president, an idea Popeye ridicules mercilessly. Olive beans Popeye over the head with a frying pan, and shouts \\"Yes, if I were President...\\" Unconscious, Popeye suddenly finds himself in a fantasy world where Olive herself is on stage appealing to voters in song. Olive promises luxuries such as clean streets decorated with bows, giant ice cream cones for children, and creative solutions to public transportation and housing shortages. The once skeptical Popeye now applauds his girlfriend's dream, and, to his delight, Olive wins the election. She becomes the country's first female President, and quickly tames a Congress populated with literal representations of the two major political parties: donkey Democrats and elephant Republicans). Popeye awakens from his dream with a changed heart, and Olive Oyl soon finds herself riding a parade float, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, as an enthusiastic Popeye shouts into the crowd, \\"for Presidink...Olive Oyl... all made for America!\\" Notes and comments Many of the gags and situations in Olive Oyl for President are reworked from Betty Boop for President, produced by Famous Studios' predecessor Fleischer Studios in 1932. Newly created Famous cartoon character Little Audrey from the Noveltoon Santa's Surprise is seen briefly licking a giant ice cream cone; Audrey's first starring short, Butterscotch and Soda, would be released six months after Olive Oyl for President. OOfP was also double-featured with the Little Lulu short, The Dog Show-Off, which was the final Little Lulu short after Famous Studios decided not to renew the license to Marjorie Henderson Buell for the Little Lulu character, and had created Little Audrey (as mentioned before). All five cartoons shared the same voice actress, Mae Questel. Olive Oyl's version of the \\"If I Were President\\" song (an earlier version appeared in Betty Boop for President) was parodied in a track of the same name from Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde, the 1992 debut album by hip hop group The Pharcyde. It is also the first Popeye cartoon to used ending title music which is also reused in many A.A.P. Popeye TV prints, but in the DVD version, Popeye the Sailor: The 1940s, Volume 3, the ending music from Amusement Park was used instead.

It was built on the site of the gardens of Palazzo Bichi, that was periodically known as Palazzo Salvatore. RNH Bighi served the eastern Mediterranean in the 19th and 20th centuries and, in conjunction with the RN Hospital at Mtarfa, contributed to the nursing and medical care of casualties whenever hostilities occurred in the Mediterranean. The building is now known as Villa Bighi and it houses a restoration unit. History =Palazzo Bichi= On the site of the current building is Palazzo Bichi (now Palazzo Bighi) also known as Villa Bichi, built in 1675 during the Order of St. John by Fra Giovanni Bichi on the designs of Lorenzo Gafa. Fra Giovanni Bichi was the nephew of Pope Alexander VII. The palace passed to his nephew Fra Mario Bichi, a member of the Order, even before it was finished as Fra Giovanni Bichi had died. He sold it to Bailiff Fra Giovanni Sigismondo, who was the Count of Schaesberg, in 1712. It was then known as Palazzo Salvatore and Gardens because of the hill being named Salvatore Hill. The palace became known again as Palazzo Bichi after it was bought by another Fra Giovanni Bichi in 1712 and remained his until his death in 1740. The palace is said to have housed Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 before his entry in Valletta but this is disputed. The building was used for quarantine for high officials during the rule of the Order of St John, such as by the Inquisitor Monsignor Paolo Passionei.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/handle/123456789/12775/Sanitary%20organization%20in%20Malta%20in%201743.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y Since the arrival of the British military in Malta it started to be known (since 1799) as Villa Bighi particularly because of the references to it by Sir Alexander Ball. Most palaces in Malta built by the Order started to be referred to as Villas by the British, and particularly the word Bichi of Villa Bichi was corrupted to Villa Bighi. Even before his arrival, the site was chosen by Nelson to build a naval hospital since 1803. The palace, or villa, and its garden become a public building of the Civil Government during the British Protectorate but was left to dilapidate. The building served as a cholera epidemic hospital in 1813-4.Attard, A. (2011). It-Tlett Ibliet fi ≈ºmien il-pesta.

It was only with the intervention of King George IV in 1827 when it was granted permission to develop the site of the gardens, and turn them in the present Bighi Hospital. This happened on the request of the Maltese governor Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby. The original villa, Villa Bichi, is today housing an educational center known as MCST. Palazzo Bichi is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority. =Villa Bighi= The Cot Lift at Bighi hospital in the middle.

On the request of the British Royal Navy to the Governor the site was handed over in 1830 to build the Royal Navy Bighi Hospital. The building was designed by the eldest son of Saverio Scerri. The building cost roughly ¬£20,000 and started operating in 1832. It accommodated 200 beds and it roughly gave service to 800 navy sailors per year. The design of Bighi Hospital is generally attributed to Colonel (later Major General) Sir George Whitmore (1775‚Äì1862) who headed the Royal Engineers between 1811 and 1829. The foundation stone was laid by Vice Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm on 23 March 1830. The works were completed on 24 September 1832, at a total cost of ¬£20,000. The West and East Wings' architecture is in the modern Doric style and built with high floors. The hospital has three separate building and are known as Villa Bighi. It should not be confused with Villa Bichi, built in 1675. The Surgical (also known as the General Hospital Block) and the Zymotic Blocks were built in 1901 and 1903 respectively. Service The Illustrated London News' depiction of Bighi Hospital in 1863 Bighi Hospital in 1875 Bighi Hospital in the 1960s Bighi Hospital contributed to the nursing and medical care of casualties whenever hostilities occurred in the Mediterranean, making Malta \\"the nurse of the Mediterranean\\". The hospital's first director (1827‚Äì1844) was Dr John Liddell. He was later appointed director-general of the Royal Navy's Medical Department, and during his office Bighi nursed casualties from the Crimean War. In 1863 the hospital looked after Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred who was ill for a month with Typhoid Fever whilst serving as an officer in the RN. He recovered from his illness. The Illustrated London News of 11 April 1863 included a detailed description of how the prince was quartered and the layout of the hospital. During the First World War, RNH Bighi accommodated a very large number of casualties from the Daradanelles. During the Second World War, the Hospital was well within the target area of the heavy bombing since it was surrounded by military establishments. A number of its buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the x-ray theatre, the East and West Wings, the Villa and the Cot Lift from the Bighi Jetty to the Hospital. Among several Doctors and nurses of renown to serve here were Doris Beale DBE. Closure and subsequent site usage Bighi indoor, in a dilapidated state before restoration (2010) In 1967, during the second rundown of the British services and their employees in Malta, Bighi Hospital was on the brink of closing down. On 17 September 1970 Bighi was closed down indefinitely. In 1977 parts of the building were occupied by the former Senglea Trade School while other sections accommodated a secondary school. Since 2010 the site has housed the head office of Heritage Malta; the national agency for museums, conservation practice and cultural heritage.

Charlotte's husband Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, was in command of a reserve force in Brussels, which was protecting that city in case Napoleon Bonaparte invaded. Elizabeth Longford described it as \\"the most famous ball in history\\". \\"The ball was certainly a brilliant affair\\", at which \\"with the exception of three generals, every officer high in [Wellington's] army was there to be seen\\". The proceedings were interrupted soon after the arrival of the Duke of Wellington, when he was notified of Napoleon's unexpected advance on the nearby crossroads of Quatre Bras. This forced him to depart after ordering his officers to leave to join their regiments. Some of the officers would soon die in battle and the poignancy of the drama has provided an enduring theme for artists, novelists and poets. The ball According to Lady Georgiana, a daughter of the Duchess, Lady Louisa, another of the Duchess's daughters, recalled: While the exact order of the dances at this ball is not known, there is a comment from a contemporary critical observer about the season in Brussels: William Heath, depicting a Prussian officer informing the Duke of Wellington that the French have crossed the border at Charleroi and that the Prussians would concentrate their army at Ligny Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington with his intimate staff arrived some time between 11 pm. and midnight. Shortly before supper, which started around 1 am., Henry Weber, an aide-de-camp to William, Prince of Orange, arrived with a message for the Prince. The Prince handed it to Wellington, who pocketed it unopened. A short time later Wellington read the message‚Äîwritten at around 10 pm., it reported that Prussian forces had been forced by the French to retreat from Fleurus. As Fleurus is north-east of Charleroi this meant that the French had crossed the river Sambre (although Wellington couldn't tell from this message in what strength)‚ÄîWellington requested the Prince to return to his headquarters immediately, and then after issuing a few more orders went into supper, where he sat between Lady Frances Webster and Lady Georgiana. To his surprise the Prince of Orange returned and in a whisper informed him of another dispatch, this one sent by Baron Rebecque to the Prince's headquarters at Braine-le-Comte, and dated 10:30 pm. It informed the Prince that the French had pushed up the main Charleroi to Brussels road nearly as far as Quatre Bras. After repeating to the Prince that he should return to his headquarters, Wellington continued to sit at the table and make small talk for 20 minutes more, before announcing that he would retire to bed. He rose from the supper- table and: The atmosphere in the room changed when news circulated among the guests that the French were crossing the border: Henry O'Neil, depicting officers departing from the Duchess of Richmond's ball Katherine Arden, daughter of Richard Arden, 1st Lord Alvanley, described the events towards the end of the ball and the rest of the night: Ballroom Floor plan by William, brother of Lady de Ros At the time of the ball no accurate record was kept of the location of the ballroom. In 1887 a plan of the house was published by Lady De Ros (daughter of the Duchess of Richmond), provided by her brother, who were both resident in the house. It was later reprinted in \\"Reminiscences of Lady de Ros\\" by the Honourable Mrs J. R. Swinton, her daughter. The coach house, proposed by Sir William Fraser in 1888 as the likely location of the ball Sir William Fraser examined the site and concluded that the room proposed as the ballroom by Lady de Ros was too small a space for the number of people who attended the ball. A short time after his visit, he wrote a letter to The Times which was published on 25 August 1888. He reported that he had likely discovered the room and that it was not part of the principal property that the Duke of Richmond had rented on the Rue des Cendres, but was a coach house that backed onto the property and had an address in the next street, the Rue de la Blanchisserie. The room had dimensions of long, broad, and about high (the low ceiling was a case where reality impinged on one meaning of Lord Byron's artistic allusion to \\"that high hall\\").Lord Byron, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto the Third, stanza XXIII. Research by lawyer P. Duvivier and published by Fleischman and Aerts in their 1956 book Bruxelles pendant la bataille de Waterloo put forward an alternative theory. It proposes that, unknown to Fraser, the coach house used as a ballroom had been demolished by the time of his investigations and that the building he assumed was the ballroom was not built until after 1815. cites List of invitations The following were sent invitations to the ball: * Major-General the Prince of Orange (wounded at Waterloo) * Prince Frederic of Orange * Duke of Brunswick (killed by a gunshot at Quatre-Bras) * Prince of Nassau * Duc d'Arenberg * Prince Auguste d'Arenberg * Prince Pierre d'Arenberg * , Mayor of Brussels * Duc et Duchesse de Beaufort and their daughter * Duc et Duchesse d‚ÄôUrsel * Marquis and Marquise d'Assche. * Comte and Comtesse * Comtesse Douairiere d'Oultremont and her daughters * Comte and Comtesse * Comte and Comtesse Auguste and their daughter * Comte and Comtesse * Comte and Comtesse Mercy d'Argenteau * Comte and Comtesse de Grasiac * Comtesse de Luiny * Comtesse de Ruilly * Baron and Baroness , their daughter and son C. d'Hooghvoorst * Monsieur and Madame Vander Capellen * Baron de Herelt * Baron de Tuybe * Baron Brockhausen * General Baron von Vincent (Austrian envoy, wounded at Waterloo) * General Pozzo de Borgo (Russian envoy, wounded) * General Miguel de √Ålava (Spanish Ambassador to The Hague ‚Äî the court of King William I of the Netherlands) * Comte de Belgade * Comte de la Rochefoucauld * General d'Oudenarde * Colonel Knife (?), A.D.C. * Colonel Ducayler * Major Ronnchenberg, A.D.C. * Colonel Tripp, A.D.C. * Captain de Lubeck, A.D.C. to the Duke of Brunswick * Earl and Countess Conyngham and Lady Elizabeth Conyngham. * Viscount Mount-Charles and Hon.

Samuel Briscall Cultural influences Millais The ball inspired a number of writers and artists in the nineteenth century. Sir Walter Scott mentioned it in passing in Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk. It was described by William Makepeace Thackeray in Vanity Fair and by Lord Byron in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. Byron emphasises the contrast between the glamour of the ball and the horror of battle, concentrating on the emotional partings, Thackeray's dramatic use of the ball in Vanity Fair inspired, in turn, a number of screen depictions. One notable example comes from the 1935 RKO production Becky Sharp, the first full-length Technicolor film released after perfection of the full-color three-strip method, which makes the Duchess of Richmond's Ball the first historical set-piece ever staged in a full-colour feature film. Critics of the day were not kind to the picture itself, but the sequence in which the officers hurry to leave the ball ‚Äî the red of their coats suddenly and emotionally filling the frame ‚Äî was widely praised as showing great promise for the dramatic use of colour on-screen. The ball also inspired artists, including John Everett Millais, who painted The Black Brunswicker in 1860, Henry Nelson O'Neil who painted Before Waterloo in 1868 and Robert Hillingford who painted The Duchess of Richmond's Ball. The ball was a scene in the third act of a melodrama called In the Days of the Duke written by Charles Haddon Chambers and J. Comyns Carr, it was displayed sumptuously in the 1897 production, with a backdrop by William Harford showing the hall and staircase inside the Duchess's house.; ; and Several characters attend the ball in Georgette Heyer's 1937 novel An Infamous Army, and also in her novelisation of the life of Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet, The Spanish Bride. Summoned to Waterloo: Brussels, dawn of June 16, 1815 by Robert Alexander Hillingford The ball was used by Sergei Bondarchuk in his 1970 film Waterloo for dramatic effect. Bondarchuk contrasted an army at peace with the impending battle and in particular as a dramatic backdrop to show how completely Napoleon managed to \\"humbug\\" Wellington. In the novel Sharpe's Waterloo (1990), Bernard Cornwell uses the ball in a similar way to Bondarchuk, placing his character Richard Sharpe in the role of the aide who brings the catastrophic news to Wellington, but includes a sub-plot where Sharpe brawls with Lord John Rossendale, Sharpe's wife's lover and a man who owes Sharpe money. A fictional account is given of the Duchess of Richmond's ball in The Campaigners, Volume 14 of The Morland Dynasty, a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles. Some of the fictional Morland family and other characters attend the ball and the events that unfold are seen and experienced through their eyes. The ball serves as the backdrop for the first chapter of Julian Fellowes's 2016 novel, Belgravia. The chapter is titled, \\"Dancing into Battle,\\" and portrays a potential m√©salliance that is avoided the next day by a battlefield fatality at Quatre Bras. Fellowes incorporates into his book real events that occurred during the ball, and inserts his fictional characters into them. Descendants of guests at the original ball, participating in the Bicentennial Ball in 2015 On 15 June 1965 the British Ambassador in Brussels held a ball to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo and the Duchess of Richmond's ball. 540 guests attended the function of whom the majority were Belgians.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode on 7 September 2007. Marcus departed on 5 September 2008, but returned on 24 April 2011. It was announced on 26 November 2013, that Condou would be leaving the soap, filming his final scenes in May 2014. Marcus departed on 14 July 2014. Storylines =2007‚Äì2008= Marcus is initially a sonographer at Weatherfield General Hospital, introduced when Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt) goes for a scan. He gives his number to Sean Tully (Antony Cotton), who is also present at the scan. The two start dating but Sean is unsure how the relationship should progress. Sean tricks Marcus into revealing the sex of the baby when he wants to know but Violet doesn't, causing a rough patch in the relationship, but it is overcome and the couple remain together happily. Marcus and Sean deliver Violet and Sean's son when Violet goes into labour in The Rovers on 22 February 2008. He is by Maria Connor's (Samia Smith) side as she gives birth to her stillborn baby in April 2008. Marcus quits his sonographer job to try to find more fulfilling employment. He and Sean plan to move into their own flat, but Sean briefly loses his job at Underworld putting their plans on hold. On 27 August 2008, Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) receives a call from her son Todd (Bruno Langley) saying that he has seen Marcus in a nightclub in London with another man. Eileen subsequently tells Sean who initially dismisses it but becomes increasingly more paranoid and angry. When Marcus discovers that Sean made a pass at Tom Kerrigan (Philip McGinley), he punches Tom as he suspects that Sean has slept with him. Marcus later tells Sean that he is fed up of his jealousy and calls a cab to take him to London. Sean pleads with Marcus but he says an emotional goodbye to Eileen, Maria and Liam (Rob James-Collier) before departing for London, leaving Sean devastated. When he leaves, he promises to keep in touch with Eileen and Maria as he has been through so much. =2011‚Äì2014= In April 2011, Sean visits Violet, Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill) and Dylan in London. After seeing them row, he decides to join Dylan in the kitchen and is shocked to find Marcus there. They agree to put the past behind them and have a day out together with Dylan. When they return, they see Jamie leaving and try to comfort Violet but Sean leaves as Violet is hostile, accusing him of trying to steal Dylan from her. As Sean gets on the coach and the coach leaves, Marcus arrives with some flowers but is too late. Several weeks later, Marcus returns to Weatherfield and catches up with Sean, Eileen and meets Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) and Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston). He announces that he has a job interview and is hoping to stay in Weatherfield. Eileen organizes a blind date for Sean which turns out to be Marcus, and they go on a date to Nick Tilsley's (Ben Price) bar, Marcus later kisses Sean and they decide to give their relationship another go. In June, Sean hears that Violet has been injured in a car crash and needs someone to look after Dylan. He decides that he should look after Dylan but does not tell Marcus as he had recently booked a holiday. However, Eileen tells Marcus about Dylan and Marcus supports Sean and they decide to go and collect Dylan but after Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) makes a remark about Sean and Dylan, causing Sean to have second thoughts but Marcus eventually persuades him to go and get Dylan. Dylan stays with them until Violet has recovered from her injuries, sparking a desire in Marcus for a child of his own but Sean is not interested. Marcus tries to pretend that being part-time dad to Dylan and helping Maria with Liam is enough but he and Sean disagree about this and split up. Marcus stays with Maria, Kirk and Liam for a while and talks about going back to London but Maria persuades him to stay. In October 2012, Marcus knows something is wrong with Maria and she eventually admits that she has found a lump in her breast. Fearing it could be breast cancer, Marcus goes with Maria to the hospital. Maria does not have cancer. They kiss, much to Marcus's surprise. They pretend it never happened and go to Eileen's birthday party, especially as Maria is dating Jason and Marcus is dating a colleague, Aiden Lester (Toby Sawyer). Eventually they admit their feelings for each other and end their respective relationships. Aiden, angry that Marcus agreed to move to London with him and then changed his mind, assumes Sean has been causing trouble. Sean gets the impression that Marcus wants him back and is horrified to find Marcus kissing Maria. He struggles to accept that Marcus is now in a straight relationship and tells Jason, who is furious that they lied to him. In November 2013, Marcus and Maria decide to buy a house together, away from the street so that there are things like boating lakes and playgrounds for Liam. Marcus feels uncomfortable when Jason's gay brother, Todd, makes a pass at him. The next day, he admits to Todd that he has everything he needs and is happy with Maria. However, Todd thinks that Marcus fancies him and kisses him. They have sex, despite Marcus instantly regretting it. Todd's mother, Eileen, is convinced that Todd and Marcus are having an affair and trick Marcus into admitting it. Todd later accompanies Marcus to a show house where he waits for Maria, but the pair end up having sex again. Maria and her friend Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) walk in on them, which leaves Marcus horrified. As Marcus later tries to explain himself, Maria lashes out, attacking him and ends their relationship for good. He is then offered a room at Todd's aunt Julie's flat, but decides to leave Weatherfield. Marcus returns and he and Todd begin a relationship, much to Maria's annoyance. Maria goes on a downward spiral and begin to secretly text Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) pretending to be Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede), Tyrone's ex-fianc√©e. After having some time off work, Marcus is called by his boss for a meeting at work. Marcus is suspended for having too much time off as his relationship with Maria gets back on track and he begins to see Liam again. Marcus is later shocked to see that his partner Todd kissing another man, making Marcus realize there is nothing left for him in Weatherfield and he decides to leave, after reconciling with Maria. He later leaves for London, after an emotional farewell with Maria, Liam and Julie. Casting In April 2008, it was announced that Condou had left the show after a year playing Marcus. A show insider said : \\"Charlie's very popular among the cast and he'll be missed. His character has made a big impact over the last year, quite ground-breaking really - no doubt there will be a juicy exit for Marcus. The likelihood will be a love triangle.\\" Speaking of his departure Condou said: \\"I have had a fantastic time in Coronation Street, but as a jobbing actor I believe it is time to move on. There are a few things in the pipeline, one of which is a feature film which is being made abroad. But all that's under wraps at the moment.\\" A Corrie spokeswoman said : \\"We'll be sad to see Charlie leave. The decision was a mutual one.\\" In January 2011, it was confirmed that Dent would return to Coronation Street. A statement on the show's official website said: \\"There are eventful times ahead for Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) as his old flame Marcus Dent returns to the cobbles. Marcus arrives back in Weatherfield on 13 May 2011 and the relationship between him and Sean is rekindled.\\" Later in 2012, Sean and Marcus split up after Marcus begins a heterosexual relationship with hairdresser Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie). In November 2013, it was announced that Condou would be leaving the soap again following a dramatic storyline for the character. The storyline sees Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) setting his sights on Marcus, despite Marcus being in a relationship with Maria. Show bosses have promised that the ensuing storyline \\"will divide the residents of Coronation Street\\". Condou spoke of his departure, \\"I've had a fantastic time at Corrie but feel it's time for me to move on. I was only meant to return for three months and ended up staying for three years! The producers have been really supportive and are leaving the door open for Marcus which is great and my exit will certainly be explosive.\\" Stuart Blackburn, show producer, added \\"I will be incredibly sad to see Charlie go and wish him well for what I know will be an exciting future.\\" References External links *Marcus Dent at itv.com Coronation Street characters Television characters introduced in 2007 Fictional bisexual males Fictional LGBT characters in television Male characters in television ","title":"Marcus Dent"},{"id":"13161424","text":"Tangry is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France.

Freeman, confirmations of this fact attributed to Mozart himself in sayings such as \\"\\" (\\"My Praguers understand me\\") have only come down to posterity second or third hand.Freeman 2013, 258-59. Perhaps the most valuable direct testimony that attests to the discernment of the musical public in Prague with regard to Mozart's music comes from Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart's opera Don Giovanni, which was first performed in Prague: > It is not easy to convey an adequate conception of the enthusiasm of the > Bohemians for [Mozart's] music. The pieces which were admired least of all > in other countries were regarded by those people as things divine; and, more > wonderful still, the great beauties which other nations discovered in the > music of that rare genius only after many, many performances, were perfectly > appreciated by the Bohemians on the very first evening.Quoted in Freeman > 2013, 2, from the Memoirs of Lorenzo da Ponte (New York, 1988), 231-32. > These observations were originally published in 1823. The most important legacy of Mozart's association with the city of Prague was the composition of the operas Don Giovanni and La clemenza di Tito and the first performance of the \\"Prague\\" Symphony, which may or may not have been composed by Mozart specifically to be performed in Prague during his first visit to the city early in 1787. Background for Mozart's Visits to Prague Daniel E. Freeman has provided the most comprehensive appraisal of the conditions that made Prague so attractive as a musical destination for Mozart in the 1780s.Freeman 2013, 7-79. One of the most important reasons include a recovery in the population of the city that created a musical public much larger than had been present in the city just a few decades prior to this time. It was only just before the time of Mozart's visits that the population of Prague finally recovered from the severe depopulation caused by the departure of the Imperial Habsburg court from Prague in 1612 on the death of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and the effects of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), whose military conflicts both started and ended in the city. Prague always retained a certain prestige as the capital city of the kingdom of Bohemia, even though its king (who doubled as Holy Roman Emperor and head of the house of Habsburg) lived in Vienna. Still, it took over a century after the death of Rudolf II for the city once again to build cultural institutions worthy of a major European city, usually due to the sponsorship of leading Bohemian nobles. The recovery in civic life led to the construction of a magnificent new opera theater, opened in 1783, that was known at the time as the National Theater (of the kingdom of Bohemia) and built at the sole expense of a visionary noble, Count Franz Anton von Nostitz-Rieneck. It was later purchased by the Estates of Bohemia and is presently known as the Estates Theatre. Considering the importance of operatic productions in Mozart's musical output, the construction of this theater was virtually a pre-condition for the fertile connections he began to cultivate with Prague in the year 1786. The emergence of an outstanding conductor, Johann Joseph Strobach, who built the opera orchestra of Prague into one of the greatest orchestral ensembles in central Europe, was also critical in attracting Mozart to the city, as was the prominence of the Duschek couple (Franz Xaver and Josepha, who had unprecedented international connections for musicians from Prague who chose not leave the Bohemian lands. Josepha had a particularly strong connection with Mozart as a result of frequent visits she made to his native city of Salzburg, where she had relatives (one of her grandfathers was once mayor of Salzburg). The immediate impetus for Mozart's visits was the result of interest for his compositions created by a highly successful performance in 1783 of his opera Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, one of the first operas ever performed in the Estates Theatre. This performance excited interest in Mozart's instrumental music and undoubtedly made the management of the Estates Theatre receptive to mounting a production of Le nozze di Figaro late in 1786, even though it was only a mixed success at its premiere in Vienna in May 1786. The Prague premiere of Figaro Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, which premiered in Vienna, was produced in late 1786 in Prague with tremendous success. The reviewer for the Prague newspaper Oberpostamtzeitung wrote \\"No piece (so everyone here asserts) has ever caused such a sensation as the Italian opera Die Hochzeit des Figaro, which has already been given several times here with unlimited applause.\\"Solomon 1995, 417. The orchestra and some affiliated music lovers funded a personal visit by Mozart so he could hear the production. Mozart's first visit to Prague and the premiere of the \\"Prague\\" Symphony Mozart first came to Prague on 11 January 1787 and stayed until the second week of February.See Freeman 2013, 83-103. He was feted everywhere. On 19 January a concert was organized for his financial benefit at which the \\"Prague\\" Symphony was given its first performance.Solomon 1995, 419. Mozart also improvised a solo on the piano‚Äîincluding variations on the popular aria \\"Non pi√π andrai\\" from The Marriage of Figaro. Afterward, Mozart said he \\"counted this day as one of the happiest of his life.\\"Solomon 1995, 419. Daniel E. Freeman points out that the level of adulation accorded Mozart on this occasion by the musical public of Prague was unprecedented for any eighteenth-century musician being recognized simultaneously as both a composer and a performer. The great success of this visit generated a commission from the impresario Pasquale Bondini for another opera, which like The Marriage of Figaro was to have a libretto by Mozart's great collaborator Lorenzo Da Ponte. Mozart's second visit to Prague and the premiere of Don Giovanni Mozart came to Prague for the second time to help supervise the first performance of his opera Don Giovanni. He arrived on 4 October 1787 and stayed until 12 or 13 November.Freeman 2013, 104-30. The premiere of the opera was supposed to have taken place on 15 October, but could not be arranged until 29 October 1787. The work was rapturously received; the Prager Oberpostamtzeitung reported, \\"Connoisseurs and musicians say that Prague has never heard the like,\\" and \\"the opera ... is extremely difficult to perform.\\"Deutsch 1965, 303 Mozart's third and fourth visits to Prague En route to Berlin in the company of Prince Karl Lichnowsky, Mozart passed through Prague on 10 April 1789 and returned on his way back to Vienna on 31 May 1789 and stayed perhaps a day or two longer.Freeman 2013,131-147. For further details, see Mozart's Berlin journey. Mozart's fifth visit and the premiere of La clemenza di Tito Mozart wrote La clemenza di Tito for the festivities accompanying Leopold II's Prague coronation as king of Bohemia in September 1791. Mozart obtained this commission after Antonio Salieri had allegedly rejected it.Davenport (1932), 360‚Äì361: \\"The Emperor Leopold II was to be crowned king of Bohemia in early September and the national States assembly at Prague had sent Wolfgang a commission to write the festival opera. Again Prague showed a loyalty that Vienna had never once indicated. Wolfgang would not refuse. He wished he had done so, however, when he learned that he was expected to write a new score to Metastasio's La clemenza di Tito (K. 621), a stiff, tiresome tragedy, of the Italian vintage of Wolfgang's boyhood in Naples. But for this there was no remedy.\\"Eisen and Sadie, section 6. Mozart arrived on 28 August 1791 and left in the third week of September.Freeman 2013, 148-77. The opera received its first performance on 6 September 1791. Unlike the first two visits, Mozart was not the center of attention on his last visit. Rather, his activities were much overshadowed by the ceremonies of the Imperial court. Commemorations of Mozart's death in Prague The grief exhibited for Mozart in Prague after his death on 5 December 1791 far exceeded that witnessed in any other European city. Daniel E. Freeman has pointed out that whereas Mozart (one of history's greatest musicians) was laid to rest in Vienna without any special performance of music and a pathetic showing of mourners, the first memorial service given in his honor in Prague (14 December 1791) was attended by thousands and featured a lavish Requiem mass performed by over a hundred musicians who accepted no pay for their efforts.Freeman 2013, 1. Many more commemorations were organized in subsequent years and citizens of Prague took it upon themselves to provide sustenance to Mozart's widow and orphaned children. His wife Constanze began her career of organizing musical concerts in memory of her husband in Prague, a lucrative undertaking that assisted her family's finances enormously until her second marriage to Georg Nikolaus von Nissen.Freeman 2013, 178-192. Why didn't Mozart stay? After Don Giovanni, Mozart may have had a tentative offer to stay and write another opera for Prague, but he chose to return to Vienna. Maynard Solomon suggested that the reasons were first that Prague lacked the musical talent available in Vienna. In addition, a career like Mozart's depended on the support of the aristocracy, and Prague was only a provincial capital. There was no patron or musical institution in Prague in the late eighteenth century capable of offering satisfactory employment to a composer of Mozart's talents. Furthermore, Daniel E. Freeman has pointed out how precarious opera production was in the city throughout the eighteenth century. Indeed, productions of Italian opera in Prague ceased again already in 1789, not to re-appear again until 1791, due to the departure of the impresario Domenico Guardasoni and the death of the impresario Pasquale Bondini.Freeman 2013, 131-140. Another possible reason why Mozart didn't stay is given by Volkmar Braunbehrens, citing Schenk: the death in Vienna in November 1787 of Gluck, whose post in the Imperial musical establishment Mozart sought (and ultimately got, though at a much lower salary); Mozart needed to return home to lobby for the position.Braunbehrens 1990, 303 Daniel E. Freeman has pointed out that the imperial appointment meant that Mozart would never live in any city other than Vienna. The prestige of such a position combined with the possibility of further employment and honors from the imperial court would have rendered any opportunities available in Prague unattractive in comparison. Why did Prague appreciate Mozart? Daniel E. Freeman has produced the most detailed appraisal of the reasons for the success of Mozart's music in late eighteenth- century PragueFreeman 2013, 44-60. The most important consideration is simply that the citizenry of Prague was likely the most musically literate of any in Europe due to a unique system of music education that grew up in the Bohemian lands after the defeat of Protestant nobles in revolt against the Habsburg regime in the year 1620. The country was forcibly re-Catholicized by the Habsburg emperors, and a part of efforts to impose the Catholic religion on the populace was the fostering of Catholic church music. Music education for both boys and girls was offered as a normal part of elementary education throughout the kingdom of Bohemia, with the result that an unusually large proportion of the population was trained to sing or play instruments. The training was never intended to foster professional careers, rather to facilitate participation in religious services, however it did lead to many professional careers and the famous emigration of Bohemian musicians to many parts of Europe due to a surplus of musical talent within the country. Contemporary observers considered the Bohemians to be as naturally musically talented as the Italians, however better trained in notation and other technical aspects of music making. The musical public of Prague, well versed in practical music making, clearly had a greater appreciation for the possibilities that Mozart explored in a style that many music lovers in other European cities (including Vienna) found too complicated and too extravagant (to use the famous phrase of the emperor Joseph II, with \\"too many notes\\"). The success of the highly sophisticated and supremely difficult music for the \\"Prague\\" Symphony and the opera Don Giovanni attests to this appreciation better than anything else. Mozart also had an unusual ability to compose imaginatively for wind instruments. Bohemian wind players were famed all over Europe for their skills, thus his mastery of wind composition was much appreciated in Prague. The Prague press specifically attributed the success of the operas Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail and Le nozze di Figaro partially to their lavish and imaginative treatment of wind instruments. The extravagant writing for winds in the \\"Prague\\" Symphony is also notable and may have been introduced deliberately to please the musical public of Prague. The treatment of winds in the \\"Prague\\" Symphony represents a landmark in symphonic writing and was copied not only in Mozart's last symphonies, but also the symphonies of Beethoven and Schubert. Commemorating Mozart in Prague today Many tourists follow his tracks in Prague and visit the Mozart Museum of the reconstructed Villa Bertramka, where the composer stayed with his friends the Duscheks on visits to Prague. It is little known that Mozart's visits to the Bertramka are actually very scantily documented. No contemporary observer ever reported seeing him there, and Mozart himself never reported staying there in any surviving correspondence from Prague. The best evidence that he stayed there (and only during his second visit to Prague) comes from his son Karl Thomas Mozart in a reminiscence of 1856. Carl Thomas was not present for the incident reported, rather only heard about it from friends of Mozart he met in Prague as a boy in the 1790s.Freeman 2013, 138-39.

Dennis Powers later joined the faculty of the Southern Oregon University School of Business in Ashland, Oregon, where he taught for twelve years and became a Full Professor with different nonfiction books published. Retiring from teaching full-time as an Emeritus faculty member, he continued his writing of books, newspaper articles, and other works that included public radio. Published works The Power of Attorney Real Estate Forms Series (software and hardcopy) and The Power of Attorney Business Forms Series (also software and hardcopy) were first published. Legal Street Smarts was next, followed by Beating the Tough Times, Legal Expense Defense, The Office Romance, and The Internet Legal Guide. Dennis Powers's nonfiction book, The Office Romance, was his publisher‚Äôs lead book in 1998 and he was on a national book tour. This book was subsequently brought out in Chinese and German editions. While then teaching at Southern Oregon University, he wrote over fifty published Internet, academic, legal encyclopedia chapters, magazine, and newspaper articles in various areas. Chronicling the 1964 tsunami from the Good Friday earthquake that raced down Alaska and the U.S. West Coast, his book The Raging Sea followed in trade and mass-market paperback. Treasure Ship was next: This work is about the loss of the S.S. Brother Jonathan, a paddlewheel steamship that sank off northern California in 1865 with millions of dollars of gold and was finally discovered 125 years later. Treasure Ship was later brought out in paperback. Next, Sentinel of the Seas came out; this book is about the construction and operation of the dangerous and most expensive lighthouse built, St. George Reef Lighthouse. He continued with Taking the Sea, a book about the old-time wreckers, or ship salvagers, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In 2010, his book about life at sea during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries‚Äîand through the story of a charismatic sea captain, Dynamite Johnny O'Brien‚Äîwas published as Tales of the Seven Seas: The Escapades of Captain Dynamite Johnny O'Brien.

It is a highly influential guitar model that inspired many other master guitar builders (including Elmer Stromberg and John D'Angelico). It was first sold in 1934 and named for its $400 price, like many Gibson guitars of that era. The Super 400 features solid carved-wood construction, and at the time of its introduction was the largest guitar that the Gibson Guitar Corporation had produced. Until 1939, it had a hand-engraved tailpiece and a hand-engraved finger rest support. During the very early production stock the truss rod cover had engraved \\"L5 Super\\"; on later guitars this was changed to \\"Super 400\\". In 1939 the guitar was changed. The upper bout was enlarged, and the hand-engraved tailpiece was replaced with the one still fitted today on current Super 400s. The f-holes were slightly enlarged and a cutaway option also became available. This was called the Super 400P (for Premiere), later changed to C for Cutaway. During the 1950s, Gibson released the Super 400 CES (Cutaway‚Ä¢Electric‚Ä¢Spanish). This had a slightly thicker top to reduce feedback, two P-90 pickups, and individual tone and volume controls, along with a three-way toggle switch. Later, the P-90 pickups were replaced with Alnico V pickups, then in 1957, humbucking pickups. There have been variations in the limited edition custom models. In 2000 Gibson offered the Super 400 with a Charlie Christian pickup. The Super 400 is still available today, with two humbucker pickups. The full acoustic version is no longer available. The 1963 Gibson Super 400 CES Florentine model belonging to Scotty Moore played an important role in Elvis Presley's stage performance, the '68 Comeback Special.

It changed trends in music across South Asia, where it broke sales records. In India, it sold 100,000 records within a day of its release in Mumbai alone, went Platinum within three weeks, and went Double-Platinum soon after. Disco Deewane went on to sell 14million units worldwide. In South Asia, where the music industry was previously dominated by filmi Bollywood soundtracks, Disco Deewaane was the first non-soundtrack album to become a major success across the region, paving the way for the emergence of independent Pakistani and Indian pop music scenes. It was also the first South Asian pop album to top the charts in Brazil, while also becoming a hit in Russia, South Africa, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Latin America, and a success among the South Asian diaspora in regions such as Canada, the United Kingdom, United States, and West Indies.

Monro Auto Service and Tire Centers is an American automotive service company focusing on scheduled maintenance, undercar repairs, and retail tire sales. Monro Auto Service and Tire Centers is named for Monroe County, New York, without the \\"e.\\" Company history =Early history= The company was founded by Charles J. August in 1957, originally as a franchise of another company, Midas Muffler. In the mid-1960s, \\"Chuck\\" August decided that his muffler shops should offer an expanded list of services. This was not in line with the other organization's wishes. In 1966, he discontinued his affiliation with Midas Muffler. August launched a new muffler service company under the name Monro Muffler with his brother, Burton S. August, and Sheldon Lane. August named the new company after Monroe County, New York, but without the \\"e\\" at the end of the name. August added brake services several years later and renamed the company, Monro Muffler Brake, Inc. Monro began a deliberate course of prudent expansion, arriving at 20 stores by 1977. They had a warehouse on West Henrietta Road. By the end of 1979, they had about 43 stores in New York. From this warehouse, drivers would load the trucks and deliver to all the 43 stores throughout New York. Afterwards, a more aggressive expansion program was instituted when the company began to make a number of large acquisitions. By the mid-1980s, there were 59 stores which generated $21 million in sales annually. Most of those locations were in upstate New York. =Expansion= Headquarters in Rochester, New York In 1984, the company's founder, Charles J. August sold his controlling interest in Monro Muffler and Brake to a New York City-based investors group headed by Donald Glickman and Peter J. Solomon. August remained on the company's board of directors until 2002. In 1991, Monro Muffler made its initial public offering. Monro's stock began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol \\"MNRO\\". Under the leadership of Robert G. Gross, who joined the company in 1998 as president and CEO and currently serves as executive chairman, Monro aggressively expanded outside of its traditional base in upstate New York. In September 1998, the company successfully purchased all 205 Speedy Muffler King locations within the United States from Speedy Muffler King, Inc. of Toronto, Canada. In 2004, Monro purchased the 25 stores and 10 kiosks of Mr. Tire, a Baltimore, Maryland chain which trademarked \\"On the Rim and Out the Door\\" pricing. Later that year, Monro bought five Rice Tire locations and rebranded them as Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers. Monro now operates 132 Mr. Tire outlets. In 2006, Monro obtained 75 ProCare shops from bankruptcy, converting 44 to Monro Muffler Brake & Service centers and 31 to Mr. Tire outlets. In fiscal 2010, the company purchased the 26 Autotire stores in Missouri and Illinois, its first venture into the mid- West, and the 41 Tire Warehouse Central stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire. Fiscal 2011 began with the acquisition of Import Export Tire Co., five retail tire and auto repair stores in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metro region, and Courthouse Tire, three tire and undercar care facilities in the Fredericksburg, Virginia area who's sales substantially declined after the acquisition. In fiscal 2012, the company acquired eight local auto service and retail groups, including Tire Barn Warehouse, 31 stores in Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee, and Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, 27 stores in Kentucky and Indiana, two chains that Monro continues to manage under the local brand names. This is also true of Curry's Auto Service In Virginia and Maryland, a 10-store acquisition in fiscal 2013. That year, the company also purchased four S&S; Firestone stores in Kentucky and six Carl King Tire Stores in Delaware and Maryland. Monro entered three new states with major acquisitions in 2014: Michigan - Lentz USA/Kan Rock Tire, 19 stores; Florida - The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, 35 stores; Gold Coast Tire & Auto Centers, 9 stores; and Martino Tire, 8 stores; and, Georgia - Wood & Fullerton, 9 stores. The company operates its Florida stores under the Tire Choice brand name. In fiscal 2015, the company purchased the Car-X trade name and franchise rights to 146 locations in Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Texas. In 2016, Monro purchased Clark Tire & Auto Inc., which operated 26 stores in North Carolina, as well as six other companies: Kwik-Fit Tire & Service Inc. in Sandy Springs, Ga.; three Excel Auto & Tire stores, in Rochester, Eagan and Spring Lake Park, Minn., operated by Task Holdings Inc., and single store operated by Autopar Inc.; Harlow Tire Co. in Westland, Mich.; two Express Tire Centers L.L.C. stores, in Hillsboro and Millford, N.H.; and Pioneer Tire Pros in Riverview, Fla.Monro buying Clark Tire, six others, Tire Business, 20 August 2016. Since 2000, Monro has made more than 30 acquisitions totaling more than 500 stores and producing revenue of 650 million. Under Monro's current interim CEO Robert E . Mellor, the company continues to pursue a growth strategy of increased market share through incremental store sales, low-cost acquisitions, and strategic new store openings. Monro serviced 6.2 million vehicles in 2019 and posted record sales of $1.2 billion, record net income of $79 million, and earnings of $2.41 per share. The company operates under several regional brands, most acquired in the past 15 years, including: Monro Auto Service & Tire Centers, Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers, Tread Quarters Discount Tire Auto Service Centers, Autotire Car Care Centers, Ken Towery's Tire & AutoCare, The Tire Choice & Total Car Care, Tire Warehouse Tires for Less, and Tire Barn Warehouse. In 2019, Monro entered the West Coast market with the acquisition of 51 stores in California, including Certified Tire and Service Centers, Skip‚Äôs Tire & Auto Repair Centers, Lloyd‚Äôs Tire & Auto Care, and Trusted Tire & Service.[5] In addition, the company acquired 20 stores in Louisiana[6] [7], including Allied Discount Tire, Atlas Tire & Auto, Scotty‚Äôs Tire & Auto, Twin Tire & Automotive, and T-Boys Tire and Auto, and the 14 Superior Tire stores in Nevada and Idaho[8], bringing Monro‚Äôs store total to 1,288 in 32 states.

It was the ninth of the thirteen cartoons in a series of thirteen to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit is a sarcastic attack on the series as a whole and its formulaic approach, which the short mocks as excessively violent and designed solely for profit. Deitch had strongly divergent views on animation compared to Tom and Jerrys creators, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, that he openly expressed throughout his lifetime. Plot The cartoon begins with a demonstration for the Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit, with which \\"anyone can now enter the lucrative field of animated cartoons.\\" The items in the kit include the following: * \\"One mean, stupid cat\\" (Tom) * \\"One sweet (innocent), lovable mouse\\" (Jerry) * \\"Assorted deadly weapons\\" (a knife, a hammer, and a stick of dynamite) * Coffee and cigarettes (removed from the kit and described as being \\"for the cartoonists\\") * A slice of watermelon The narrator says, \\"First, put the sweet, lovable mouse into a simple situation expressing a natural human need, such as eating a slice of watermelon contained in our kit. The result may not make sense, but it will last long enough for you to be comfortably seated before the feature begins.\\" This statement refers to the original theatrical exhibition of the cartoon, in which it ran ahead of a feature film. At first, Jerry eats the watermelon and spits the seeds out, hitting and waking Tom, who initially grabs the hammer to attempt to hit Jerry but instead flicks him in the back of his head. Jerry swallows the seeds by accident, causing him to turn green for a moment and then make sounds like a shaker when he moves, and goes into a lively dance until Tom traps him in a metal can. Tom uses Jerry as a maraca for his own dance; when the effect suddenly stops, Tom peeks inside only to get a mouthful of seeds spat into his face. He gets very mad and devours the rest of the watermelon and turns his head into a cannon to fire blasts of seeds at Jerry, who takes cover in the kit box just before Tom hits it, blowing up the stick of dynamite and destroying the box. Jerry winds up lying beneath a book named Judo for Mice, studies it, and emerges with enough fighting skill to easily overpower Tom. Not even a stint of training at a boxing gym and use of the knife can give Tom any advantage against Jerry. Finally Tom goes to a judo school in order to face him again. The two have a breaking contest, in which each tries to outdo the other: Jerry with a wooden board, Tom with a brick, then Jerry again with a cement block. The contest ends abruptly when Tom tries to break a huge block of heavy marble, which crashes through the floor and takes him with it. An unconscious Tom ends up in the battered box. Jerry replaces the lid as the narrator pipes up, \\"Our next film will be for the kiddies, and will demonstrate a new poison gas. Thank you and good night.\\" The words on the lid say \\"The End, an MGM cartoon\\" like an ending typical of a Deitch Tom and Jerry short. The music winds to stop as if it was being played on a slowing phonograph record, and Jerry bows to the audience in typical Japanese fashion, as the gong is sounded, making the screen fade to black. Reception * While the Deitch shorts were generally negatively-received by Tom and Jerry fans, this particular short is often considered one of the best of the thirteen cartoons, due to its inventive plotline and satirical nature.Cartoons Considered For An Academy Award-1961-Cartoon Research See also * List of American films of 1962 References External links 1962 films 1962 short films Films directed by Gene Deitch Tom and Jerry short films 1960s American animated films American films 1962 comedy films Self- reflexive films 1962 animated films American animated short films Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films ","title":"The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit"},{"id":"13161610","text":"Lucius Minucius Basilus (died 43 BC) was a military commander and politician of the late Roman Republic, a trusted associate of Julius Caesar, who later participated in Caesar's assassination.

Geographically, it is the largest Health Board, covering an area of from Kintyre in the south- west to Caithness in the north-east, serving a population of 320,000 people. In 2016‚Äì17 it had an operating budget of ¬£780 million. Organisational structure NHS Highland is composed of two Health and Social Care Partnerships (HSCPs). The Highland Health and Social Care partnership covers the local government area of Highland. It has two main divisions. The North and West operational unit covers Caithness, Sutherland, Lochaber and Skye, Lochalsh and Wester Ross. The Inner Moray Firth operating unit covers Raigmore Hospital, Badenoch and Strathspey, Mid Ross, Inverness and Nairn. The Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership covers the local government area of Argyll and Bute. History On 1 October 2001 NHS Highland health board was established. NHS Highland's first board members were announced 10 days later. In 2005 Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) were introduced. On 1 April 2006, NHS Highland took over responsibility for part of the former NHS Argyll and Clyde region (corresponding approximately to the Argyll and Bute council area), the other part of which was transferred to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. On 1 April 2012 NHS Highland became the lead agency responsible for Adult Social Care services, with the council taking over issues relating to children. It directly employs over 10,500 people and there are also around 1,000 primary care staff in the region. In December 2014, Broadford was chosen as the site for a new hospital, after a consultation process. Some campaigners had hoped that the central hub of services could have been based at Portree Hospital, however the Scottish Health Council has pronounced the process followed by the board as legitimate. In 2017, the board reduced the number of main administrative buildings- refitting Assynt house, which the board owns, and reorganising Larch house which is leased. Skyports, a drone delivery service provider, began delivering pathology samples, medicine, essential personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing kits in Argyll and Bute in 2020. Delivery should take only 30 minutes, where previously it has taken 48 hours. Communication will be provided by Vodafone‚Äôs 4G network and satellite communications. The plan is to integrate the operation into the local NHS supply chain. Training initiatives In 2011 NHS Highland announced it would be running a week-long \\"boot camp\\" for junior surgeons at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.

It was conceived that a state supported college located in the center of the state at Columbia, South Carolina would foster friendships between those of both regions thus allowing the state to present a united front to the nation when threatened with issues jeopardizing the South Carolina way of life. The University of South Carolina's history can be described in four distinct phases: a firebrand college (1801‚Äì1862), constant reorganization (1865‚Äì1891), college to university (1891‚Äì1944) and the state's university (1944‚Äìpresent). An 1872 illustration of the Horseshoe, USC's original campus. The Maxcy Monument is in the center Firebrand college, 1801‚Äì1862 =South Carolina College= Jonathan Maxcy South Carolina College Enrollment The University was founded as South Carolina College on December 19, 1801 by an act of the General Assembly after Governor John Drayton pushed for its foundation on November 23, 1801. The establishment of a publicly funded college at the capital was intended to unite and promote harmony between the Lowcountry and the Backcountry. On January 10, 1805, having an initial enrollment of nine students, the college commenced classes with a traditional classical curriculum. Jonathan Maxcy was its first president and served until his death in 1820. With the generous support of the General Assembly, South Carolina College acquired a reputation as the leading institution of the South and attracted several noteworthy scholars, including Francis Lieber, Thomas Cooper, and Joseph LeConte. However, the college suffered greatly and lost most of its prestige when it closed during the American Civil War. =Civil War= The students formed a cadet company in December 1860 to aid the Southern cause, but an order by Governor Pickens prevented them from leaving Columbia. Undeterred, the students disbanded their company on April 12 and formed a new company while en route to Charleston so that the governor's previous holding orders would be invalid. Once in Charleston, General Beauregard assigned the company to guard Sullivan's Island, much to the dismay of the students who greatly desired to be a part of the Battle of Fort Sumter. After three weeks of guard duty, the student cadet company returned to Columbia to a hero's welcome. Later in June 1861, the students reformed the company and requested to be accepted for service. Governor Pickens accepted their request provided that the faculty also approved the venture, but the faculty did not give its consent because they did not want the college to needlessly be closed. The frustrated students even went as far as negotiating service of their unit with President Jefferson Davis, who agreed, but again Governor Pickens denied their use because the faculty was not willing to let them go. When the students returned in October, they reorganized their military unit as the \\"third company.\\" The Union attack of the South Carolina coast in November at the Battle of Port Royal led Governor Pickens to agree to their request to be mustered for active duty, but President Longstreet and the faculty steadfastly maintained their opposition to the students leaving for service. However, with the support of the governor the students ignored the protests of the faculty and departed for the Lowcountry. Governor Pickens kept the student company in Charleston to serve as his bodyguard and because the Union forces at Port Royal did not press their advantage, he released the students from military service on December 10. Seventy-two students were present for classes in January 1862 and the college functioned as best it could until a call by the Confederate government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers. A system of conscription would begin on March 20 for all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, so on March 8 all of the students at the college volunteered for service in order to avoid the dishonor of having been conscripted. Despite the depletion of students, the professors issued a notice that the college would temporarily close and would reopen to those under eighteen. When the college reopened on March 17, only nine students showed up for classes and it became quite apparent to all that the college would not last past the end of the term in June. On June 25 with the consent of the state government, the Confederate authorities took possession of the college buildings and converted them into a hospital. After many unsuccessful attempts to reopen the college, the trustees passed a resolution on December 2, 1863 that officially closed the college. By February 1865, Sherman's army had reached the outskirts of Columbia and the college was spared from destruction by the Union forces because of its use as a hospital. In addition, a company of the 25th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment was stationed at the campus on February 17 to protect it from harm and to thwart off pillaging Yankee soldiers. Reorganization, 1865‚Äì1891 =Radical University= The Union army took possession of the college on May 24, 1865 and although the future for the college under military control, General John Porter Hatch sent a letter on June 19 to the remaining professors at the college that it should reopen as soon as possible. The appointment of Benjamin Franklin Perry as provisional governor of South Carolina on June 30 by President Andrew Johnson restored civilian rule to the state. Perry reinstated the trustees to their positions and the board met on September 20 to authorize the college to reopen on the first Monday of January in 1866. In a message to the legislature in October, Perry sought to convert the college into a university because with the state in an impoverished situation, it would provide a more practical education. The model that he wished to follow was the elective system used by the University of Virginia. Perry was succeeded in November as governor by James Lawrence Orr, a graduate of the University of Virginia, who also wished to see the college adopt the curriculum of his alma mater. Little opposition developed to change the College into a university and bill to establish the University of South Carolina was passed by the General Assembly on December 19, 1865, sixty-four years after the institution's foundation. The schools of the university remained largely the same as they were in the College, with the addition of a school of engineering and mathematics. For the students, the difference was great because they were given much more freedom than afforded in the College, and they were given the ability to choose their classes rather than having to submit to a compulsory curriculum identical for all. Perry and Orr believed that the relaxed atmosphere at the University would allow it to prosper and reach three or four hundred students in a few years. The reopening of the University was pushed back to January 10 due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings on the campus and to celebrate the anniversary of the original opening of South Carolina College. Fewer than fifty students attended in the first term, which alarmed Governor Orr. He recommended to the General Assembly that schools of law and medicine be added, which the legislature established in 1866. Despite this step, the University faced an ominous future as the state was beginning to undergo Reconstruction. After Radical Republicans gained control of the state government in 1868, they sought to integrate the University; the constitution of 1868 had stated that all universities of the state should be \\"free and open to all the children and youths of the State, without regard to race and color.\\" Former Governor Orr urged the legislature to preserve the University as an institution for the whites and to convert the dormant campus of The Citadel into a college for the blacks. Governor Robert Kingston Scott ignored this request and recommended that the legislature bring the University into compliance with the Morrill Act to make it qualify as a land grant college and accept federal aid; it had to remove race as an admissions criteria. The University Act of 1869 reorganized the University and provided it with generous state financial support. An amendment was added to the act by W. J. Whipper, a black representative from Beaufort, to prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the University. The legislature elected two black trustees to the governing board of the University on March 9, 1869. Franklin J. Moses, Jr., state representative and speaker of the house, also supported admission of all races to the state school. In October 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Republican secretary of state, was admitted as the first black student; he was of mostly white ancestry with a white politician father. The admission of black students to the University was inevitable, and three factors contributed to this. First, the University never achieved a level of enrollment that was commensurate with its financial backing by the legislature. Enrollment never exceeded one hundred students, whereas the enrollment at Wofford College exceeded that mark in 1870. White students were believed to avoid the university from fear it would be integrated. The second reason was the failure of the state to provide an adequate public university for the education of blacks. It was trying to compensate rapidly for the state's failure to educate blacks in the antebellum years. In 1872, funds were allocated for the Agricultural and Mechanical Institute at Orangeburg, but they were badly mismanaged. Black legislators called for the opening of the University to black students. Finally, the state Republican party split for the election of 1872 between Radical and moderate factions. The Radicals won and pressed their advantage by electing four blacks to the Board of Trustees, thus constituting a majority. The legislature established a normal school to train teachers for the lower grades on the campus of the University as well as a preparatory school, since most black students of the state had been deprived of strong academic training in years past. In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished. On October 7, 1873, Henry E. Hayne, the Secretary of State of South Carolina, became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the University. As a result of his enrollment, three professors resigned, and some white students left. On October 8, enrollment stood at eight students, seven of whom were the sons of professors. The number increased to twenty-two students after many politicians registered with the University to show that it was open for both races, yet few of the politicians attended classes. Troubled by the low enrollment, State Treasurer of South Carolina, Francis L. Cardozo went to Washington and persuaded a handful of students at Howard University to transfer to the University. Drastic measures were required to increase the number of students and the legislature passed an act in February 1874 to provide for 124 scholarships of $200. The conservative press denounced this move because with the absence of tuition, it meant that students were effectively being paid to attend the University, but poor students were often critical to family support, and scholarships helped them cover living expenses. Many of the scholarship students could not meet the entrance requirements into the freshman class, so the faculty assembled them into a sub-freshman class. This plan was abolished in 1875 as the legislature had not authorized it. The scholarships achieved their desired effect in increasing enrollment and by 1875, 90% of the student body was black. The University of South Carolina holds the distinction of being the only state university in the South to admit and grant degrees to black students during Reconstruction. When the Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876, they quickly acted to end admission of blacks, closing the University on June 7, 1877 by a joint resolution of the General Assembly. They passed legislation authorizing only white students and setting up Claflin College as the state institution for black students. =Redeemer University= It was far from certain that the University would be reopened and debate ensued in the General Assembly over the necessity of the University. Many legislators, led by Martin Witherspoon Gary, felt that the state had other obligations and it was not practical for the state to spend money on the University. In addition, these legislators were from the Upstate and had no attachment to the University. They were not part of the planter elite and had attended other schools. An act to reorganize the University was passed by the state Senate by two votes on March 2, 1878, but it did not provide for the appropriation of funds to the reopening. The act specified that the University was to consist of two branches, one styled as the South Carolina College in Columbia for the whites and Claflin College in Orangeburg for the blacks. In order to mollify agitation by the farming interests, a section of the act specified that an agricultural department was to be established with the University. On October 5, 1880 the institution was reopened as the South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts and largely derived its funding from the Morrill Act. Despite its name as an agriculture and mechanical college, few students showed an interest in either area. Only nine students worked the college farm for the first session and just twenty-one attended the mechanical shop. Because the state could not afford a liberal arts University, it took advantage of the Morrill Act in order to acquire federal funds, and offered some agriculture program to satisfy its requirements. By 1881, the state's financial situation was markedly improved and Governor Johnson Hagood called for greater expenditures on higher education. With a much higher appropriation, the trustees abolished the farming and mechanical foreman positions, in 1882 restoring the institution to its antebellum status as the South Carolina College. An agriculture department remained, but little of the curriculum was agricultural, and it was essentially identical to the general science program. The department suffered from neglect because its professor, John McLaren McBryde, was also the President of the institution and in that position he focused most of his energies. In the latter years of the 1880s, the College increasingly came under attack from religious groups and agricultural interests. The denominational colleges, struggling to rebuild from the Civil War, demanded that free tuition be ended at the college, and the General Assembly capitulated in 1887 by fixing tuition rates at $40 per year. Led by Ben Tillman [who owned 400 acres as a planter, cultivated by tenant farmers], the agrarians pushed to establish a separate agriculture college because they believed that the College was not providing an adequate education in agriculture. Despite Tillman's rhetoric, a majority of the students were sons of farmers. At that time, the most advanced agricultural research was being conducted at Cornell and the University of California, both liberal arts colleges. To take advantage of the Hatch Act and to assuage the concerns of the farmers, the legislature passed an act in 1887 to reorganize the college as the University of South Carolina with six schools and colleges. An agricultural experiment station was set up, the college farm was expanded by , and a well-developed agriculture program was initiated. The University was so successful that Ben Tillman announced his retirement from public life. Thomas Green Clemson bequeathed his estate in 1888 to establish and endow a separate agriculture college in the state. Tillman reemerged to carry the cause to the legislature and in 1889, Governor Richardson signed the bill accepting the bequest. The Morrill and Hatch funds were transferred to the new agriculture college in June 1890, and the University's agricultural department was closed. The vitality of the University was threatened during the 1890 campaign when Ben Tillman advocated its closing. Although he won the election for governor, he completed reorganization of the university as a liberal arts college during his term. College to university, 1891‚Äì1944 =Wounded institution= USC Enrollment The University was reorganized as the South Carolina College in 1891, and it struggled to attract students through the rest of the decade. It was restricted to teaching the subjects of law, literature, classics, and theoretical science. The prestige of the College had fallen such that in 1893, a proposal was offered in the legislature to close the campus and provide homes for Confederate veterans on it instead. With enrollment lagging and the state lacking a liberal arts school for women, the legislature passed a bill in 1893 that mandated the College to admit women. On September 24, 1895, Frances Guignard Gibbes was the first woman to be admitted to the College, and in 1898 Mattie Jean Adams was the first to graduate. Although Tillman had crippled the institution when he became governor, he did not let it die. The number of students steadily declined from a high of 235 in 1889 to a low of 68 in 1894; but despite the urging of legislators to close it, Tillman ensured through his governorship that the College received an adequate level of funding. Tillman re-established the normal school at the College, long dormant since the end of Reconstruction. In addition, the legislature authorized adding engineering to the College in 1894 despite a previous prohibition. =Reemergence as a university= The victory by Duncan Clinch Heyward in the gubernatorial election of 1902 marked the end of Tillmanism and the return of support by the governor's office for the institution. Heyward pushed the legislature to convert the College into a University in 1905 to mark the centennial by providing the state with a capstone for its educational system. The effort failed when legislators feared that The Citadel was to be absorbed into the University, but the measure was reintroduced in 1906 and passed on February 17 to charter the institution for the last time as the University of South Carolina. For the next forty years, the institution struggled to find its identity as it cycled through periods of achieving popularity versus academic excellence. Under the vigorous leadership of President Samuel Chiles Mitchell from 1909 to 1913, enrollment at the University doubled; he brought the University to the state by setting up extension courses in 1910. Incessant criticism by Governor Coleman Livingston Blease over Mitchell's handling of University affairs led to his resignation and the trustees elected William Spenser Currell with the intention of raising the level of scholarship at the University. Entrance requirements were made more stringent and Currell's efforts were rewarded when in 1917 the University became the first state-supported college or university in South Carolina to earn accreditation by the Southern Association. The entrance of America into World War I was enthusiastically supported by the student body, and the vast majority participated in the ROTC unit at the University. To compensate for the loss of enrollment because of conscription, the war department replaced the ROTC program with the Student Army Training Corps. After the war, the SATC was disbanded and military training was made compulsory for freshman and sophomore students in the ROTC program. The ROTC program was scrapped in 1921 due to lack of interest. An aura of stagnation existed at the University in the early 1920s and the trustees elected William Davis Melton in 1922 to revive its fortunes. Melton launched a campaign to popularize the institution by convincing the people of the state that it was not exclusively for the elite or a special interest group, but rather for the masses. He gained a major increase in the appropriation by the legislature for the University, and in 1924 student enrollment surpassed that of Clemson for the first time. Following Melton's death in 1926, Davison McDowell Douglas was elected President to consolidate the gains and tighten academic standards. The board of trustees called upon James Rion McKissick in 1936 to return to Melton's policies of popularizing the University. McKissick established the University News Service to combat perceived misconceptions of the University and to promote the high moral character of the students. Due in large part to his efforts, enrollment reached record numbers and the University entered the 1940s with a renewed sense of optimism. Yet, the world soon became engulfed by World War II. To help with the loss of enrollment because of mobilization, the University received a Naval ROTC detachment. The University was quickly transformed into a Naval school when the Navy set up a V-5 Navy Flight Preparatory School, a Civil Aeronautics Administration-War Training Service program, and a V-12 Navy College Training Program. The V-12 program was the most important to the University because the trainees were enrolled in classes; they became active participants in student life and extracurricular activities. The State's University, 1944‚Äìpresent =New and greater university= USC enrollment By November 1944 it was clear that World War II would soon be coming to a close and the servicemen would return to enroll in the university in massive numbers due in large part because of the passage of the G.I. Bill. Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives and trustee of the University Solomon Blatt unveiled a proposal called the \\"new and greater university\\" plan that would move the university from its present site to a site just outside Columbia. At the time, the university was the smallest state university in the South and a larger campus would more easily allow for expansion at much less cost. The idea of a move came from that of the relocation of Louisiana State University in 1925 and it was envisioned that a new campus would provide the impetus for the University of South Carolina \\"to establish itself as a great American state university.\\" Blatt obtained support from all the key players in the politics of South Carolina to facilitate the proposal: Governor Olin D. Johnston, Governor-elect Ransome Judson Williams, Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Edgar Allan Brown, and Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Morris Tuten. The Board of Trustees approved the plan in December 1944 by a vote of 17‚Äì2, although complaints were issued from the dissenting voters that the decision was made with too much haste and without any input from the public. In addition, Blatt chose Navy Rear Admiral Norman Murray Smith as the President of the University in large part because he held connections in the political establishments of South Carolina and the federal government necessary to secure funds for the relocation of the university. However, Blatt's proposal caused an intense uproar in the state because alumni and students felt that it would needlessly sever the university from its antebellum tradition. Other complaints arose that the process itself did not allow for public input and it was detested as a product of the Barnwell Ring. Even with the outpouring of condemnation, municipalities lobbied to have the University moved to their locale such as Camden, Cheraw, Georgetown, Manning, Spartanburg, Sumter, Kershaw County and Oconee County. Blatt realized that his proposal in February 1945 would not receive the necessary support in the legislature and he modified it so that the University would expand upon its existing area. This idea was warmly received by the alumni and students, but it died in the Finance Committee after Senator Edgar Brown declined to take up the matter. After World War II, enrollment at the University swelled from the influx of veterans. They were wholeheartedly welcomed by President Smith who actively campaigned for their attendance and he announced that every qualified veteran would be admitted to the University. The vast majority of South Carolina veterans chose to attend the University because of its hospitable atmosphere, but also for other reasons. They did not want to attend Clemson or The Citadel because \\"the prospect of returning home to attend a military college was distasteful for the older men leaving the military after fighting the largest war in world history.\\" In addition, Clemson's rural location and its self-imposed restriction on the number of students made it inaccessible for a large number of veterans. The University offered several special programs to meet the needs of the veterans and it continued an accelerated calendar until 1949. It was at this point in history that the two universities switched reputations and missions. Carolina became known as the university for the common man and an institution accessible for all whereas Clemson settled into a status of elitism. President Smith faced increasing criticism through his tenure because he failed to articulate a clear policy for the University's future and he did not campaign for the legislature to appropriate enough funds for its needs. As president of a public university, Smith's chief responsibility was to be its publicist and develop ties with the political power of the state. Instead, Sol Blatt grew tired of having to carry the burden for the University in the legislature and Governor Thurmond felt that he received an icy reception from the administration. In 1952, Smith resigned and the prot√©g√© of Governor Byrnes, Donald S. Russell, was elected President by the Board of Trustees. =Growth and prosperity= The ascendancy of Russell was crucial for the University at a critical moment in its history because he brought youth and dynamic leadership to the Presidency. His vision for the University was for it to be the capstone of the state's higher education system and for it to be the senior partner to the other state colleges. Russell's first step toward building a great university was the strengthening of the faculty by bringing in nationally known professors. Secondly, he improved the academics at the University through the expansion of courses, the revamping of programs and the introduction of entrance examinations. A report conducted by MIT to overhaul the engineering department became the standard used by the American Society for Engineering Education to accredit all engineering schools. In response to the ruling by the Supreme Court of Brown v. Board of Education, the University instituted entrance examinations so as to prevent the mass rush of black high school graduates to enroll at USC. The examinations were also welcomed because they would promote individual merit over wealth or connections and USC became the first college to introduce entrance examinations. Thirdly, a massive building and renovation program was initiated and it was made possible through the acquisition of the properties on the southern boundary of the campus. The renaissance enjoyed by the University became evident by the speakers for commencement addresses and special convocations. Among the distinguished who came to speak at the University were John F. Kennedy, Carl Sandburg, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Ren√© Pleven, and John Foster Dulles. Russell resigned in 1957 so that he could run for governor in 1958 and Robert L. Sumwalt was named as the temporary president by the trustees. By the end of the summer of 1958, Russell had failed to win the Democratic nomination for governor and the University was still without a permanent President. A movement was started to bring Russell back as the President and he gave positive indications that he would return as President if offered. Yet, many were opposed because they felt that Russell was opportunistic and would leave the University again for the next gubernatorial campaign. Russell had also annoyed many associated with the University through his harsh rhetoric against Ernest Hollings on the campaign trail. The board of trustees was split and instead voted unanimously in 1959 to make Sumwalt the permanent President. An initiative started by Russell and continued by Sumwalt was the establishment of regional campuses and the formation of the University System. The first extension campus was set up at Florence in 1957 and additional campuses were gained in Beaufort, Lancaster and Conway in 1959. Another campus was added to the system in 1961 at Aiken. The University System served two purposes, it expanded the University's reach across the state and the branch campuses acted as a feeder system for the main campus in Columbia. Sumwalt retired in 1962 and he was replaced by Thomas F. Jones as President. Immediately, Jones was confronted by the integration problem that the University faced. Clemson admitted Harvey Gantt in January 1963 and it was just a matter of time before the University would be forced to admit blacks. USC exhausted its legal options in the summer and although large sentiment was against the integration of the University, there was no extra resistance to it requiring federal troops as occurred that same summer at the University of Alabama or at the University of Mississippi the previous year; the latter of which contained violence which had a dramatic conscientious effect on many segregationists in the University community. A student leader perhaps best expressed the altered sentiments of many when he wrote that while \\"we do not want integration . . . neither do we want to be blamed for the loss of dignity and integrity.\\"Lesesne, Henry H. (2001). A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940‚Äì2000. University of South Carolina Press. p. 144 On September 11, African-Americans Henrie Dobbins Monteith, Robert G. Anderson, and James L. Solomon, Jr. were admitted to the University peacefully. For the next two decades following integration, the University experienced rapid growth and expansion due in large part to the baby boomer generation entering college. Enrollment stood at 5,660 in 1960, but by 1979 had reached nearly 26,000 students on the Columbia campus alone. The expansion of the University was not limited to the Columbia campus; additional campuses and colleges were set up throughout the state. Clemson established an extension center in 1965 at Sumter, only away from Columbia. Sol Blatt, then the Speaker of the House, wrote President Tom Jones that \\"the University should build as many two year colleges over the State as rapidly as possible to prevent the expansion of Clemson schools for the Clemson people.\\" President Jones heeded Blatt's advice and over the next decade, the University added campuses in Allendale, Spartanburg, Union and Walterboro. The Clemson extension at Sumter never proved popular, and USC acquired the campus in 1973. The growth of the University in the 1960s and 70s also brought with it the social activism and disorder of the time. Due to the massive influx of so many students in a short time period, the administration lost control of student life. Drug and alcohol use became so rampant at the University that it became known as a party school. Black students protested the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 by setting fire to Hamilton College and the USC Field House. On May 7, 1970, approximately 400 students seized the Russell House as a symbolic gesture towards honoring those killed in the Kent State shootings and four days later on May 11, they attempted to meet with the members of the board of trustees, but were rebuffed. Columbia police were called in to quell the student protest but were ineffective. State troopers were also unable to disperse the students. National Guard troops were ordered to the campus by Gov. Bob McNair, and soon dispersed most of the protestors with tear gas. The inability of the administration to control such student outbursts led to President Jones' resignation in 1974. But he had succeeded in turning a sleepy southern college into a full-fledged research institution. =International recognition= James B. Holderman, a flamboyant and charming executive, was elected President by the board of trustees in 1977. Right away, Holderman championed a proposal to create an honors college because it would foster an academic environment conducive to excellence necessary to keep South Carolina's best students instate. The proposal was approved and the first students were admitted into the South Carolina Honors College in 1978. A persistent problem for the University was the Columbia campus's relationship with the semi-autonomous regional campuses. Once a campus reached a Full-time equivalent of 1,000 students, it was entitled to become a four-year college and the campuses in Aiken, Spartanburg, and Conway took advantage of this rule. The law providing such a transformation was repealed, but it was apparent that the regional campuses were acting in their own interests and not for the University system. Furthermore, the Columbia campus had to compete against its regional campuses for funding because each campus submitted its budget to the General Assembly. To correct these problems, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan that outlined a centralized and unified approach to be taken by the University system. This meant that it would be necessary for lawmakers to fully fund the University system in order for the branch campus to receive the funds they need. The Carolina Plan worked brilliantly as the University system was fully funded in 1977 for the first time since 1967. Following up on his success with the Carolina Plan, Holderman issued the Carolina Plan II which called for making USC an international university and a \\"Window to the World.\\" To achieve his goals, Holderman used his connections and his personal charisma to attract world leaders to the USC campus. He was able to put USC on the map by bringing in such world leaders as UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, President Ronald Reagan, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and many other foreign dignitaries. The highlight of the visits was that of Pope John Paul II in 1987. He exclaimed on the Horseshoe that \\"it is wonderful to be young and a student at the University of South Carolina.\\" The Pope later led a non-denominational service before more than 60,000 at Williams-Brice Stadium. The international spotlight on the University came at a price and an inquisitive journalism student led to Holderman's downfall. Paul Perkins, a journalism student upset with tuition increases, requested that the University release the salary of visiting professor Jehan Sadat. Holderman balked and refused to release the details even after Perkins and his wife Cheryl filed a Freedom of Information Act request. This denial and the secrecy on the part of the administration led the media to scrutinize other aspects of Holderman's presidency. They inspected his travel budgets and construction contracts and found overwhelming evidence of financial irregularities and extravagant spending. In face of all the negative publicity, Holderman resigned in 1990. Holderman would later be convicted of laundering drug money in 2003. The University trustees elected John M. Palms to succeed Holderman to restore the institution's credibility and respect in the state and world. After leading the University's bicentennial celebrations in 2001,University of South Carolina Bicentennial Homepage Palms retired and was replaced by Andrew A. Sorensen in 2002. During his tenure from 2002 to 2008, Sorensen raised large sums for research, including a $300 million grant for colorectal cancer.

Literary societies Student literary societies were an important part of student life at Carolina for the first 150 years or so. The Philomathic was the first such society and was formed within weeks of the opening of SCC in 1805; it included practically the whole student body. In 1806 it was split into the Clariosophic and Euphradian societies.Hollis, Daniel Walker, (1951) University of South Carolina, Volume I, South Carolina College, p. 230. After the university admitted women students, the Hypatian Society was founded in 1915 for women, followed by the Euphrosynean Society in 1924.Hollis (1956) University of South Carolina, Volume II ,College to University, p. 316. While both the Clariosophic and Euphradian Societies were deactivated in the 1970s, alumni from the Euphradian Society reactivated the organization in 2010. It continues to operate to this day.

Lungshar was one of the 'three favourites', close aides cultivated over two decades by the 13th Dalai Lama, who assigned Tibet's modernisation program to him. The other aides were Tsarong and Kunpella, who were both from peasant stock. All three were said to be exceptionally talented and intelligent with great depth of character. The 'genius', Lungshar, was a doctor, musician, philosopher, poet and statesman.Mullin 2001, pp. 271‚Äì2 As with Tsarong and Kunpella, as soon as their protector the 13th Dalai Lama died Lungshar became a target for the ultraconservative Lhasa elite who opposed all modernisation and reform: he was accused of plotting a coup and installing a communist system and was arrested along with, amongst others, the Dalai Lama's trusted personal attendants.Thondup, Thurston (2015) pg. 60 Being a noble and thus seen as a greater threat than the other close aides, he was imprisoned and had his eyes gouged out to prevent any further political opposition from his side. The decision to blind the popular, reformist Lungshar came from Trimon, the reactionary chief minister who had been his chief political opponent.Thondup, Thurston (2015) pg. 61 Background Lungshar came from an aristocratic family with a history of service to the 5th Dalai Lama;Goldstein 1989, pg. 157 his father was a Major (Rup√∂n) in the Tibetan Army and he was an Accountant of the 6th rank in the Accountant-General's Office at Lhasa during the 13th Dalai Lama leadership. Hosted at tibet.prm.ox.ac.uk. In 1912 the reform-minded Dalai Lama, who considered him one of his most able and trusted officials,Thondup, Thurston (2015) pg. 59 sent him to England and several European nationsGoldstein 1989, pp. 161‚Äì2 to supervise four Tibetan students at Rugby School and to act as ambassador at large for Tibet. These students studied modern technology and English to facilitate the reforms the Dalai Lama felt necessary in Tibet. During his travels in Europe Lungshar learned English, encountered Western democracy, developed an appreciation of England's system of constitutional monarchy and became convinced that Tibet needed major political reform if it were to survive in the modern world.Goldstein 1989, pg. 161 On his return to Tibet he became the leader of a new progressive group in the Tibetan government and making great efforts to introduce reforms he became one of the most popular and respected officials in Tibet, except with the conservative nobles and the monastics who were not happy to pay taxes to fund an army, amongst other reforms which he tried to implement. It was 1914, at a time when the Dalai Lama was strengthening state institutions including the military. Lungshar was appointed tsip√∂n, i.e. one of the four heads of the revenue office. He increased revenue for the state, at the expense of the aristocratic and monastic landlords, making enemies amongst the elite in the process.Goldstein 1989, pg. 162 In 1929, he became commander in chief of the military, still retaining his post of tsip√∂n as well. He further strengthened and modernized the military, but lost his military post in 1931, after a diplomatic incident when his men pursued a miscreant into the Nepalese embassy. He remained tsip√∂n until the Dalai Lama's death in 1933.Goldstein 1989, pp. 163-4 Lungshar's Residence in the Potala Palace complex. Lungshar was one of several parties vying for control of the government following the Dalai Lama's death. He defeated rival Kumbela by launching a campaign of suspicion that Kumbela had brought about the Dalai Lama's death. Kumbela was exiled, but Lungshar failed to gain ascendency.Goldstein 1989, pp. 169‚Äì77 Lungshar was eventually outmaneuvered by the more conservative minister Trim√∂n. Lungshar was arrested and punished by the removal of his eyeballs. This was considered the most serious punishment short of death. No one alive had ever seen this punishment done, but members of the untouchable ragyaba class, who traditionally performed mutilation punishments, had been told by their parents how it was done.Goldstein 1989, pp. 207‚Äì9 The 14th Dalai Lama later assured Thomas Laird, however, that after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama Lungshar merely gathered those who wished to continue his modernisation campaign, with the main aim of having the government led by lay officials, rather than by monastics who lacked experience in administration. But the religious and lay conservatives who opposed modernisation accused him of treason. The swift arrest, imprisonment and blinding of Lungshar at Trimon's behest ended any further discussion of reform in Lhasa.Laird 2006, pp. 256‚Äì7 His son, Lhalu Tsewang Dorje, was also a noted politician. According to certain sources,http://karmapaissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/affirm- geoffrey-samuel.pdf Tulku Urgyen accounts this as well in \\"Blazing Splendor\\", Rangjung Yeshe Publ. 2005, P. 59ff.

Bloomsbury Publishing, 2004 pg. 38/39 and Wong, Sylvia: The Karmapa Prophecies, Delhi 2010, pg. 2 and 370. Tenga Rinpoche says in an interview, that these events are mentioned in the biography of the 15th Karmapa, written by a teacher of the 16th Karmapa, Jamg√∂n Kongtr√ºl Khyentse √ñser, without naming the \\"minister\\" by name (Interview mit Tenga Rinpoche, in: Dharmanektar Nr.3/89). during the late 1920s, Lungshar promoted the idea that another of his sons was the reborn 16th Karmapa. The Dalai Lama and most of the officials in his government are members of the Gelug sect, while the Karmapa is the leader of the Karma Kagy√º sect. These sources state that the Dalai Lama initially supported this claim in opposition to the supporters of the previous Karmapa, who had already recognised Rangjung Rigpe Dorje as the new Karmapa. However, as the child fell from a roof and died, the Dalai Lama later withdrew his support of Lungshar's son and agreed to the recognition of Rangjung Rigpe Dorje.

Despite dismantlement , much of the metalwork remains and retains the legal status of a grade-II listed structure. Plans for a partial re-build in 2019 have been made by the pier's owner, Conwy County Borough Council. Designed by Maynall and Littlewoods the pier opened in 1900 and was extended in 1903 to the length of 227m. The first two pavilions built on the pier burnt down along with a bijou theatre. The third pavilion was built in 1934 and significantly extended and altered in the 1970s to allow for nightclub and amusement arcade entertainments. From the late 1980s the pier began to decline with the seaward portion of the pier being closed due to its poor state of repair. The condition of the pier and the entertainments continued to decline until 2008 when it closed permanently. A long-standing legal wrangle between the previous private owner and the council ensued. By 2013 the pier was in danger of collapse and a local community group attempted to secure funding for a rebuilding programme which failed. In 2017, part of the pier collapsed onto the beach below, dangerous sections of the pier were dismantled and a new plan to create a shortened pier were agreed upon by the council and a charitable trust representing the community interest. Construction Victoria pier as originally constructed Designed by Maynall & Littlewoods of Manchester, Colwyn Bay's Victoria Pier was one of the later British piers to be built, with construction starting in June 1899 by the Salford firm of William Brown & Sons. Many of the pier's components were pre-fabricated, and manufactured by the Widnes Iron Foundry. Its official opening was on 1 June 1900, when the architect, Mr. Littlewood, handed a golden key to the pier's owners. As first constructed, the pier was just 316 ft (96m) long and 40 ft (12m) wide, comprising a timber promenade deck with seating and railings along its length, and a 2,500 seat pavilion in the Moorish Revival style. The pavilion was set to the right of the deck, with a walkway allowing access to the pier-head to the left. The pavilion's main entrance was flanked on one side by a flower shop and, on the other, by a coffee lounge and cake shop. Inside, the pavilion boasted a large balcony which extended around three sides of the auditorium and a full orchestra pit. In 1903, the Victoria Pier Company decided to extend the neck to a length of 750 ft (227m) to facilitate outdoor theatrical performances. The pier featured intricate cast iron balustrades, manufactured by the Widnes Iron Foundry, and similar balustrade designs can be found at Mumbles Pier, and formerly at Grand Pier, Weston-super-Mare and Morecambe's Central and West End Piers.https://piers.org.uk/pier/colwyn-bay-victoria/ First and second pavilion buildings Decorative railings on the pier A 600-seat 'Bijou' theatre was built at the pier head in 1917 for the purposes of light entertainment. The first pavilion building was completely destroyed by fire in 1922. The Victoria Pier Company suffered serious financial difficulties after the fire. As a result, Colwyn Bay Urban District Council purchased the pier and work began immediately to rebuild the pavilion. In July 1923, the second pavilion was opened, at a cost of ¬£45,000. Unfortunately, disaster struck again on 16 May 1933, when the second pavilion was destroyed by fire, followed, on 28 July 1933, by a fire that destroyed the Bijou Theatre.https://www.nashpartnership.com/our-work/victoria-pier-colwyn-bay/ Third pavilion Colwyn Bay Urban District Council set about rebuilding, and the third pavilion was opened on Tuesday 8 May 1934 at a cost of ¬£16,000, but the Bijou Theatre was never rebuilt. The pavilion was designed by architect Stanley Davenport Adshead, and the rebuilding also involved constructing a cast iron covered walkway, extending to the pavilion, as well as a bandstand in the south-east corner of the pavilion section of the pier. Increasing usage of the pier led the council to introduce a twopenny toll (free after 6pm) in 1936, which included the price of a deckchair and listening to the band. The purpose of the toll, said the council, was to prevent 'indiscriminate lounging on the pier'. In the pavilion, Ernest Binns presented 'The Colwyn Follies', with seats at two shillings, and one shilling and sixpence. During the 1950s and 60s, the pier began a period of gentle decline. In 1953, the pavilion's tearoom, which had been a year-round meeting place for forty years, started closing for the winter. In 1956, the line-up of entertainment in the pavilion was as follows: Monday: bingo, Tuesday: wrestling, Wednesday: amateur talent show, Thursday: old-time dancing, Friday: popular dance, Saturday: young people's dance. 1958 saw the end of the summer variety shows in the pavilion. In 1959, the variety shows were replaced by a small orchestra of six musicians; over 20,000 people paid nine pence each that year to attend the afternoon concerts, with another 10,000 attending in the evenings. By 1961, falling audiences forced the council to reduce the orchestra to three musicians. 1962 saw the council admit defeat for live performances and install pre-recorded orchestral music. The pier saw minor refurbishment and repairs in 1964, and a small amusement arcade was built at the seaward end. Both the amusements and the bandstand were removed in the 1970s. 1970s modernisation In 1968, ownership of the pier passed from the local council to Entam Leisure, a division of Trust House Forte, for just ¬£59,000. Entam Leisure decided that the pier needed modernisation to prosper. This involved building the Golden Goose Amusements in a large new modern building on the pier neck, the opening of the Golden Fry Restaurant in the old tearooms, and the conversion of the pavilion into the Dixieland Showbar. As part of this work, the ornate Moorish toll booths at the entrance to the pier were removed to create an open aspect to the pier entrance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Dixieland Showbar hosted many live concerts, featuring groups/acts such as Motorhead, The Damned, Siouxsie & The Banshees, Elvis Costello, Slade, The Specials, Cockney Rejects and Black Flag.http://link2wales.co.uk/2012/crudblog/dixieland-colwyn-bay-pier/ In 1979, the pier was sold again, this time to Rhyl-based leisure operators, Parker's Leisure. They converted the Dixieland Showbar into CJ's Nightclub and built an extension onto the front of the Golden Goose Amusements, to create a larger entrance/amusements area. Decline 1987 saw the entire seaward end of the pier being closed to the general public, on grounds of safety. In 1991, Parkers Leisure closed down their amusement and disco businesses on the pier. Vandals attacked the pier after the closure, smashed most of the windows in the former Golden Goose Amusements, and broke into the pavilion to set fire to it. In 1993, Colwyn Borough Council gave permission to demolish the pavilion and seaward end of the pier, but the work was never carried out. August 1994 saw new hope for the beleaguered pier, as marine engineer Mike Paxman bought it and stated he intended to restore it to its former glory. Paxman carried out work to repair the pier's decking and subdivided the former Golden Goose Amusements building into several smaller business, including a bar, cafe, shops and amusements, which opened on 1 April 1996. He also intended to reopen the pavilion as a nightclub, but did not have sufficient funding to do so. During this time, the pier featured prominently in the Hetty Wainthropp Investigates episode \\"Childsplay\\", broadcast in January 1998. Paxman eventually put the pier up for sale in 2003, by advertising it on auction site eBay but it failed to sell. On 11 December 2003, the pier was bought by Cambridgeshire businessman Steve Hunt, who sold his house to fund the ¬£100,000 purchase price. He reopened the pier on Saturday 17 January 2004 and announced his intention to gradually restore the decaying structure. He has a particular interest in restoring the pier's Art Deco pavilion, built in 1933. In 2008, the entrance building housed a fishing tackle shop, cafe, bar (which was extended, refurbished and renamed 'Oddities' for the 2008 season) and a selection of amusement machines. The pavilion was home to various special events, such as the successful annual art exhibition. A small section of the pier neck was open to the public, mainly housing an outdoor seating area for the bar. The main area of the pier neck was closed to the general public, but was open for fishing, subject to the purchase of a permit. Closure Victoria Pier in 2007 The pier closed at the end of July 2008, as a result of a bankruptcy order made against the owner, Steve Hunt, by Conwy County Borough Council in respect of unpaid business rates. Hunt attempted to have the bankruptcy order annulled but with no success and the pier remained closed to the public. A documentary, entitled Pier Pressure, was shown on BBC2 Wales in December 2008; the film followed Steve Hunt's attempts to rescue and restore the Victoria Pier over a one-year period. Regeneration attempts right In 2012, Conwy County Borough Council bought the Pier from the Receivers, Royce Peeling Green and intended to grant a lease to a local community group if they were successful. In late March 2012, Conwy Borough Council announced they would put in a request for lottery funding to be used to save the pier. However, the request was denied and the structure still lay in a bad state, with fencing blocking people from being able to go under the pier for health and safety reasons. In 2013, the Pier regeneration had a new lease of life, thanks to a local community group, who formed a third sector company called Colwyn Bay Shore Thing. The company, in partnership with the local authority, were successful in a Round 1 grant application to the Heritage Lottery fund. However, it was denied in Round 2 in 2015. The Lottery Fund stated that a large part of the denial was the council's refusal to support or back the Round 2 application on cost grounds. After the refusal, the council announced they were going ahead with plans to delist and demolish the pier. Following a huge public outcry, CADW Welsh Heritage refused planning permission for demolition. Phase one of Restoration Plans The final 45 metres of the seaward end were destroyed in a series of collapses, first on the 1 February 2017, and the second on the 23 February. On 2 March 2017, a council meeting agreed to support phase 1, which includes an initial shortened pier and new pavilion put forward by the Colwyn Victoria Pier Trust. The dangerous seaward section of the pier, representing around half of its length, was removed in March 2017. An area of decking to the south of the pavilion, part of which was also in a state of collapse, was also dismantled at this time. The council then applied for planning consent to remove the remaining buildings and dismantle and store the pier, with the long term aim in working with the Victoria Pier Trust to reinstate the listed structure in the future. Dismantling of the pavilion began in February 2018 and the pier had been dismantled (and, in part, stored) by May 2018. The final piece of the pier was dismantled on 15 May 2018https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-wales-44113372 with the final site clearance completed in June 2018. Planning has now been passed for phase 1 of the restoration work to begin. Conwy Council will be rebuilding the 1st part of the pier, of an area exactly covering the former site of the Golden Goose amusements building: a length of approximately 40 metres. Following the completion of this stage, in partnership with Conwy Council, the Victoria Pier Trust will apply for grants to rebuild phase 2, which will be to rebuild the remaining part of the Pier, restored from storage. A new Pavilion, however, will be built and the design will be available for public consultation. Phase one of the Truncated Pier will be built by October 2019. Contractors for the restoration work and rebuilding are currently being selected and the finances have already been secured. The Art Deco murals created by Eric Ravilious and Mary Adshead in 1934, from inside the pavilion, have all been successfully removed and are currently awaiting restoration.

Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. This results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK and stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and, worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals.

With a total length of 8‚Äì10 cm (3‚Äì4 in), they are among the smallest birds in the woodpecker family. Species limits in this genus are doubtful, and the rate of interbreeding is \\"inordinately high\\" (Remsen et al. 2007). As defined by Winkler and Christie (2002), it contains the 27 species listed below, all from the Neotropics except the speckled piculet, which is Asian (and sometimes placed in a monotypic genus, Vivia). Their upperparts are brownish, greyish or olive, in some species with darker barring or white or yellowish spotting on the mantle. The underparts vary greatly among the species, ranging from all rich brown in the chestnut piculet, to whitish in the plain-breasted piculet, white with dark bars in the white-barred piculet, and pale yellowish with dark bars on the chest and dark spots and streaks on the belly in the bar-breasted piculet. They have black crowns with red, orange, or yellow marks in the male and white dots in the female, except that the male speckled piculet has brown crown marks and the female lacks white dots. Most have rather short black tails with white stripes down the edges and the center (Blume and Winkler 2003). In two species, the rufous-breasted and the chestnut piculets, the white is largely replaced by rufous. While the individual species often are habitat specialists (as evident by a number of highly restricted species such as the rusty-necked and ochraceous piculets), members of this genus range from dry Caatinga woodland to humid Amazonian and Atlantic Forest. They are generally found in pairs or small groups. The Neotropical species fall into two broad song groups, with the first having a song consisting of a long trill, and the second a song consisting of series of two or more descending notes.

Marcus Porcius Latro (died 4 BC) was a celebrated Roman rhetorician who is considered one of the founders of scholastic rhetoric. He was born in Roman Spain, and is mentioned often in the works of his friend and contemporary Seneca the Elder, with whom he studied under Marillius. In 17 BC, Latro declaimed before Augustus and Agrippa.Seneca the Elder, Controversiae ii. 12. p. 177, ed. Bipont. Comp. Clinton, F.H. ad ann. His school was one of the most frequented at Rome, with the poets Ovid and Abronius Silo among its students. Latro is said to have possessed an astonishing memory, and displayed the greatest energy and vehemence, not only in declamation, but also in his studies and other pursuits. He is described as being invariably occupied in speaking, or preparing to speak, and he was considered by some to be the \\"manliest\\" of declaimers. He would study constantly and work himself to the point of exhaustion, after which he would restore himself with a holiday in Tuscany of hunting and farming, during which he never touched a book or pen. It was a peculiarity of Latro's that he would seldom, if ever, listen to his students declaim. They were there to listen and learn, to the declamations of Latro himself, or to his ironical comments on his rivals. His students therefore received the name of auditores (\\"listeners\\"), which word came gradually into use as synonymous with discipuli (\\"learners\\"). His declaiming style was against unreality, and he avoided the fantastical displays of ingenuity which tempted most speakers on unreal themes. He always tried to find some broad simple issue which would give sufficient field for eloquence instead of trying to raise as many questions as possible. But great as was the reputation of Latro, he did not escape severe criticism on the part of his contemporaries: his language was censured by Messalla, and the arrangement of his orations by other rhetoricians. Though eminent as a rhetorician, he did not excel as a practical orator; and it is related of him that, when he had on one occasion in Spain to plead in the forum the cause of a relation, he felt so embarrassed by the novelty of speaking in the open air, that he could not proceed until he had induced the judges, through his friend the propraetor of Hither Spain, to remove from the forum into the basilica. Latro died in 4 BC, as we learn from the Chronicon of Eusebius. Many modern writers suppose that Latro was the author of the Declamations of Sallust against Cicero, and of Cicero against Sallust.Seneca the Elder, Controversiae i. Praef. p. 63, &c.;, ii. 10, p. 157, ii. 13. p. 175, iv. 25, p. 291, iv. Praef. p. 273, ed. Bipont.; comp.

In 1934 he was part of the staff of Isoroku Yamamoto during the preparation of the Japanese delegation for the London naval conference in which he participated as an attendant. He was probably chosen as a participant because he was aware of the European mentality with which he had become familiar as early as the 1930s when he was a naval attache at the Japanese Embassy in Paris.

Under the Dawes Plan, the German economy boomed in the 1920s, paying reparations and increasing domestic production. Germany's economy retracted in 1929 when Congress discontinued the Dawes Plan loans. This was not just a problem for Germany. Europe received almost US$8 billion in American credit between 1924 and 1930 in addition to previous war time loans. Germany's Weimar Republic was hit hard by the depression as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped. Unemployment soared, especially in larger cities. Repayment of the war reparations due by Germany were suspended in 1932 following the Lausanne Conference of 1932. By that time, Germany had repaid 1/8 of the reparations. People were devastated about how the Weimar Republic dealt with the economy. Falling prices and demand induced by the crisis created an additional problem in the central European banking system, where the financial system had particularly close relationships with business.

On Feb 25, 2015 they announced a series A round of $6.2 million.  Products  Klipfolio offers an online dashboard platform for building real-time business dashboards. It allows business users to connect to many data services, automate data retrieval, and then manipulate, and visualize the data. Klipfolio uses a schema-less architecture that allows non-technical end users to more easily connect to data sources, and separates data from presentation to more efficiently use and reuse data sources throughout the platform. Klipfolio has built-in formula editing, allowing end-users to transform, combine, slice, and filter any data before visualizing it. Users are able to access the dashboard from their desktop, tablet, TV, and mobile phone, and share it with colleagues by granting access to the dashboard, or by scheduling email reports.  History  Serence is the former name of a Canadian corporation known for its Klipfolio Dashboard KPI dashboards or enterprise dashboards, formed in 2001, when Allan Wille (CEO) and Peter Matthews (chief experience officer ‚Äì CXO) pursued their vision of a simple application that assembles current information from multiple sources into a single, consistent, and coherent presentation format. Wille and Matthews were joined by James Scott (CTO). The first version of Klipfolio Dashboard appeared later that year. As an early RSS reader, it used the technology to populate its various Klips. In 2002, the application evolved to include a JavaScript-based semantic markup language which created relationships among disparate bits of data, presented data more consistently, and allowed a developer to create and modify Klips. Additionally, the company adopted a clean design philosophy. To avoid various integration and performance challenges associated with off-the-shelf code, the research and development team opted for proprietary internal systems including an XML parser, HTTP stack and novel CSS-based matching architecture. These developments were all designed to fit within a core code package less than 500 KB.

The Irish Poor Laws were a series of Acts of Parliament intended to address social instability due to widespread and persistent poverty in Ireland. While some legislation had been introduced by the pre-Union Parliament of Ireland prior to the Act of Union, the most radical and comprehensive attempt was the Irish act of 1838, closely modelled on the English Poor Law of 1834. In England, this replaced Elizabethan era legislation which had no equivalent in Ireland. Pre-Union In 1703, the Irish Parliament passed an act for \\"Providing the erection of a workhouse and for the maintenance and apprenticing out of foundling children\\". By 1771, there were 'Houses of Industry in every county and by 1833, the total cost was ¬£32,967.George O'Brien, the Economic History of Ireland From the Union to the Famine, 1921, p.168 Post-Union Until 1838, the use of 'Houses of industry' was on a much smaller scale than in England and Wales. =Poor Law Unions= The report of the Royal Commission on the Poorer Classes in Ireland 1833 led to the Irish Poor Law Act of 1838, under which three \\"poor law commissioners\\" divided Ireland into poor law unions, in which paupers would receive poor relief (either workhouse or outdoor relief) paid for by a poor rate based on a \\"poor law valuation\\". The name \\"union\\" was retained from the English \\"union of parishes\\" model although the Irish union boundaries diverged greatly from those of the civil parishes. A union was named after the town on which it was centred, where its workhouse was located. Unions were defined as groups of poor law electoral divisions, in turn defined as groups of townlands. Electoral divisions returned members to the board of guardians, with voters who paid higher rates having more votes. During and after the Great Famine, boundaries in the impoverished west were redrawn to create more and smaller union for easier administration. When the Irish General Register Office was established in 1864, each union became a superintendent registrar's district, with groups of electoral divisions forming a dispensary or registrar's district. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 divided administrative counties into urban and rural districts, with each rural district corresponding to the non-urban portion of a poor law union within the county. =Emigration= During the Great Famine, workhouses became so overwhelmed that large numbers of paupers were assisted to emigrate. This had the effect of permitting more to enter the workhouse in the hope of escaping starvation and disease. In response, Guardian-assisted emigration was reserved only for those who had received indoor relief for over two years.The Irish poor law Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. After partition Following the Partition of Ireland, in the independent Irish Free State, poor law unions and rural districts were abolished in 1925 and the powers of boards of guardians transferred to the county councils' County Boards of Health or County Boards of Public Assistance. In Northern Ireland, poor law unions survived until the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Service in 1948.

He was a member of the United Freedom Front. Laaman grew up in Roxbury, Massachusetts and Buffalo, New York. His family emigrated to the United States from Estonia when he was a child. He has a son. He is currently serving a 53-year prison sentence for his role in the bombings of United States government buildings while a member of the United Freedom Front, an American leftist group in the 1980s.Case-Study: The United Freedom Front Laaman was sentenced for breaking and entering in New York and was sent to prison. Under a special University of New Hampshire program to bring former prisoners to the university, facilitated by popular Education Professor Carlton Menge, Laaman entered the University of New Hampshire. In the 1960s, Laaman worked in Students for a Democratic Society and community organizations and advocated against the Vietnam War and racism. As a student at the University of New Hampshire he was a leader in the SDS. He was also a leader in the student strike in May 1970 in reaction to the bombing of Cambodia and the deaths of six protesting students at Kent State University and Jackson State College. He facilitated youth development in the Black Panther Party and the Puerto Rican Young Lords street gang. In Attica Prison, his cellmate for a time had been Sam Melville. The Attica prison riot in 1971 and the death of Sam Melville, according to Lamaan targeted for execution by the state police, contributed to Laaman's further radicalization. In 1972 he was arrested and charged with bombing a Richard Nixon re-election headquarters building and a police station in New Hampshire and was sentenced to 20 years. However, he was released in 1978. In 1979, he and Kazi Toure helped to organize the Amandla Festival of Unity to support an end to apartheid in Southern Africa, which featured musician Bob Marley. He was eventually caught with several other members of the United Freedom Front, referred to as the Ohio 7, including leader Tom Manning in 1984. While originally charged with seditious conspiracy, Laaman was found guilty of five bombings, one attempted bombing, and criminal conspiracy, and sentenced to 53 years in prison. In 1977, an important New Hampshire State Supreme Court case was won by Laaman.Laaman v. Helgemoe, 437 F. Supp. 269 (NH 1977). Helgemoe was the warden of the New Hampshire State Prison. Laaman sued to receive reading material which he was refused. Helgemoe claimed that the material was radical, seditious, and even included bomb-making instructions. The New Hampshire Supreme Court decided in favor of Laaman, and this case eventually was used as a justification for offering college level education in New Hampshire prisons for the first time. The case has been cited for various reasons with respect to prisoners' rights in other states was well. Laaman's current projected release date is May 15, 2021.  Writings  * Jan Laaman (Contr.

He was one of the most important blues musicians in Denmark, and he was known outside his own country, when in the late 1960s he met Alexis Korner and the two formed the bands New Church, The Beefeaters, Collective Consciousness Society aka CCS, and later Snape. Career Thorup played at the age of 18 in the Danish band, Beefeaters, and he met Korner on his concert tour in Scandinavia. They formed New Church, and then in 1970 Collective Consciousness Society around Korner and Thorup, the rest of the line-up was rather loose and depended on the availability in the schedules of many musicians. Frequent performers within the band included Tony Carr (drums), trumpeter Harold Beckett, Herbie Flowers on bass guitar, Henry Lowther (trumpet) and Harold McNair with woodwind instruments. They were among the first groups to record on Mickie Most's RAK Records and John Cameron arranged their albums. They had several hit singles, commencing with a cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", which was used as the theme for BBC Television's Top Of The Pops. Their music was characterised by Korner's growling vocals and Thorup's higher tones. They split in 1973 to create a band, Snape, that Korner and Thorup formed when on tour with King Crimson in the United States. King Crimson members Boz Burrell, Mel Collins, and Ian Wallace left Robert Fripp in New Orleans to continue on tour with Korner. Thorup appeared on Korner's 1972 studio album Accidentally Born in New Orleans. A live album from this band was released in Germany. During this period, Thorup frequented London's nightclubs, performing with Korner and Colin Hodgkinson on bass. In 1976 Thorup returned to Denmark to work with Danish musicians including Sebastian. Thorup mostly played rock or blues, but he also got a local pop hit, recording a Danish version of Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton's \\"Islands in the Stream\\" with Anne Grete in 1984. In the last couple of decades of his life he lived a quiet life, playing small concerts in Denmark and recording a few albums.

He edited Mailer's selected letters in 2014 and the Library of America's two-volume set Norman Mailer: The Sixties in 2018. Early life Lennon, a native of Cape Cod, grew up in Somerset, Massachusetts. He graduated from Stonehill College, a Catholic school south of Boston, in 1963 and became a U.S. Navy officer during the Vietnam War. After sea duty on the USS Uvalde for 30 months, he taught military law and history at Naval O.C.S. Newport in the late 1960s. He served five years on active duty (1964-1968). He first encountered the work on Norman Mailer when he read The Naked and the Dead as a fifteen-year-old: \\"The language was uninhibited, the sexual descriptions, the descriptions of war. ... It's really an odyssey of suffering.\\" He earned his M.A. (1969) and Ph.D. (1975) in English at the University of Rhode Island, where he began his scholarly work on Mailer in the classes of Dr. Nancy Potter, who directed his dissertation on Mailer's Armies of the Night. Lennon and Mailer While working on his dissertation in 1971, Lennon watched Gore Vidal and Mailer's altercation on The Dick Cavett Show. Lennon wrote a letter of support to Mailer who then invited Lennon to hear him speak. Afterward, they met at a bar and began their long friendship and collaboration. Mailer enjoyed the Irish \\"bravura\\" and sense of humor, so he took an immediate liking to Lennon. Lennon and his wife Donna and their sons became friendly with Mailer's family, including all nine children, and his sister Barbara Wasserman and her son Peter Alson, and enjoyed regular visits in the summers. Lennon became Mailer's literary executor in 1981 and proposed a collection of Mailer's essays and interviews which became the 1982 collection, Pieces and Pontifications, which Lennon edited. Mailer would later add: \\"Sometimes I think Mike Lennon and I were as designed for each other as some species of American Yin and Yang, as hot dogs, perhaps, and mustard. His talents, his discipline, and his ambition form a complement to all the slacks, voids, and indolences of my nature.\\" In 1988, Lennon edited Conversations with Norman Mailer, a collection of 34 of his interviews and a key source for those writing about Mailer. By this time, Mailer had begun sharing drafts of his books with Lennon, who began assembling a collection of his books, his uncollected reviews, essays, poems and letters to the editor, and everything in print he could find about Mailer. At Lennon's suggestion, in 1994 the Mailer papers, previously housed in Manhattan, were moved to a large professional storage facility in Pennsylvania. This arrangement made it more convenient for Lennon and Mailer's current biographer and archivist Robert F. Lucid to have access. Lennon and his wife began to re-organize the papers, sifting and sorting through 500 cubic feet of paper. This led to work on a comprehensive annotated listing of Mailer's writings, and those about him. Norman Mailer: Works and Days, compiled by the Lennons, was published in 2000, with a preface from Mailer, and is the standard Mailer bibliography. Three years earlier, Lennon and Lucid assisted Mailer in putting together a mammoth collection of his writings, The Time of Our Time. Mailer's archive found its permanent home at the University of Texas' Harry Ransom Center in 2005. Lennon helped broker this $2.5 million deal. In 2000, Lennon began the task of reading and selecting Mailer's letters. It took him almost three years to read all 45,000 letters (25 million words), and he remains the only person, save Mailer, who has read them all. Since Mailer was open and frank in his letters, Lennon explains to Sipiora, they became the most important sources for the biography. In 1997, the Lennons purchased a condo in Provincetown a short walk from the Mailer house, and spent weekends and summers there. The Lennons often played Texas Hold'em with Mailer, enjoying the play, friendly banter, and Jameson's. In Mailer's later years, the Lennon's would become honorary members of the Mailer family. In 2003, a volume of Mailer's insights on writing, The Spooky Art, was published, edited by Lennon. It contains excerpts from previously published items by Mailer, excerpts from interviews Mailer had given, and fifty original pieces written for the book. Barbara Wasserman, Mike Lennon, and Norman Mailer in 2006 When Lucid died unexpectedly in December 2006, Lennon, always Lucid's understudy, took over as authorized biographer‚Äîwhat he called \\"a comfortable job\\" after their 35-year acquaintance. A year later Mailer died. Lennon, Lawrence Schiller and Mailer's widow, Norris Church Mailer, produced the memorial to Mailer at Carnegie Hall in the spring of 2008. In 2008, Lennon signed a contract with Simon and Schuster for the biography. He also entered into an agreement with the Mailer Estate granting him full access to the Mailer letters and unpublished manuscripts. Lennon and his wife moved full-time to their condo in Provincetown where Mailer had begun writing his final novel, The Castle in the Forest (2007), in fall of 2000. Lennon had kept extended notes on Mailer's table talk, and also interviewed him on many aspects of his public and private life. Lennon's unpublished \\"Mailer Log,\\" his record of Mailer's last three years, runs to 150,000 words. The summer before Mailer died, he and Lennon completed work on a series of interviews on Mailer's theological ideas and theories. The ten long discussions were published as On God: An Uncommon Conversation just days before Mailer died. Over the next four years Lennon interviewed 86 people, including his ex-wives, children, cousins, sister, nephew, and many close personal and literary friends, including Don DeLillo, Gay Talese, Robert Silvers, Barbara Probst Solomon, David Ebershoff, Ivan Fisher, Eileen Fredrikson, Lois Wilson, Carol Holmes, Tina Brown, Harry Evans, James Toback, Nan Talese, Dotson Rader, Doris and Dick Goodwin, William Kennedy, Richard Stratton, Mickey Knox, and Lawrence Schiller, Mailer's most important collaborator. Schiller gave Lennon access to all of his interviews with Lawrence Grobel which became important for understanding the Schiller- Mailer relationship. Schiller also enlisted Lennon to edit four new editions of Mailer books, including The Fight, Marilyn, and Of a Fire on the Moon for Taschen books. The Lennons made several month-long visits to the Mailer archives in Texas, in 2008 and 2009, and in the fall of 2009, he began writing, breaking his daily routine only to conduct interviews. At the end of October 2012, after six years of writing and research, he submitted the biography to Simon and Schuster. In 2018, Lennon was criticized for asserting in an interview that Mailer \\"was never accused of hurting any women\\", before being reminded by the interviewer that Mailer had stabbed his wife. Academic life Lennon got his first teaching job at the University of Illinois at Springfield in 1972. Lennon moved into academic administration in the late 1970s, and became publisher of Illinois Issues magazine, and the director of what is now WUIS-FM. These and other units (a public TV station and small press later on) were eventually combined into the University's Institute of Public Affairs, and he became its first executive director in 1988. He continued to teach and assisted University of Pennsylvania professor, Robert F. Lucid, then Mailer's authorized biographer and archivist. In 1992, Lennon was appointed Vice President for Academic Affairs at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, PA. While at Wilkes, Lennon also served as co-director of the Wilkes University low-residency MA/MFA in Creative Writing, a program which he founded in 2004, along with current Program Director Bonnie Culver. In 2000 after nine years on the job, Lennon stepped down from the V.P. position. He moved to the English Department which he chaired for two years. He is Emeritus Vice President for Academic Affairs and Emeritus Professor of English at Wilkes University. He continues to teach in the Wilkes M.F.A. Program and The Mailer Colony, and serves on the advisory boards of both. He served from 2005-2007 as a literary consultant at the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin, where he assisted in the cataloging of Mailer's papers, and was a Fellow there in 2009. Research and publications J. Michael Lennon reads at Barnes and Noble in March 2014. Norman Mailer: A Double Life was published on October 15, 2013, seven years after Lennon took the mantle from Lucid. Lennon based his 320,000-word biography primarily on Mailer's prodigious epistolary output and a series of over-200 interviews with family, friends, and collaborators of Mailer's. Early on, Mailer granted a score of interviews with Lennon and encouraged him to \\"put everything in,\\" warts and all, censoring nothing. Lennon chose the title Double Life because he saw that Mailer had two minds about most anything of consequence, reflecting his belief that everyone's psyche has two separate personalities. \\"Every identity that he had‚Äîand he had dozens of identities, occupations and avatars, whether he was playing author, playwright, politician or raconteur‚Äîalways had another half to it\\", Lennon states. \\"I think part of it was because he was always interested in 'The Other,' the minority of good in evil people and the minority of evil in good people. He was always looking for that minority that would help define and give personality to other people\\". An aspect of Mailer's double life also includes his being born between two generations: one as part of the post-World War II writers like James Jones and the other as participant of the sixties' New Journalism. Lennon's challenge included adding as much information about Mailer's private life as he did about Mailer's well-known public exploits. \\"Mailer knew me as an archivist and a bibliographer and a fact fetishist who collected the bits of his life and work\\", Lennon says; \\"I really tried to bring in material that no one had ever seen before, and God knows I had plenty of it\\". Reviews of A Double Life have been mostly positive and enthusiastic. O'Hagan states that \\"Lennon often puts his finger on the kind of detail that makes sense of Mailer's character\\" and \\"Lennon's biography is dense with careful detail\\" presenting \\"more of Mailer than we‚Äôve had from anyone other than Mailer\\". French calls it \\"a riveting blow-by-blow account of a vigorous life\\", and Elliott avers that Lennon \\"does an admirable job of allowing Mailer's various iterations of himself to emerge without judgment or apology\\". Elliott calls Double Life an \\"excellent academic resource with over 100 pages of endnotes‚Äîa treasure for literary scholars\\" that is \\"enlightening, lively, and a pleasure to read, it is almost certain to become the standard Mailer biography\\". LaRoche suggests that DL \\"may be the definitive biography of one of the most important writers of the second half of the 20th century.\\" Moore adds that the biography is a \\"behemoth of appropriate scope to frame a man who led a big life,\\" and Pritchard writes that DL \\"won't be improved upon\\" as it \\"is a feat [Lennon] performs with care and without pomposity.\\" Margulies writes of A Double Life: \\"Lennon manages to resist inserting a personal agenda into the biography and, as such, it reads as a rare and true portrait of the writer, who insisted that his biographer 'put everything in'\\". In 2014, Lennon published a volume of Mailer's letters in The Selected Letters of Norman Mailer. Including 714 letters, this volume published by Random House includes an introduction, 90 pages of notes, and a bibliography. It's a comprehensive volume of letters spanning 1940‚Äì2007, giving readers a glimpse into Mailer's dressing room. It includes letters to celebrities like James Baldwin, Saul Bellow, Jorge Luis Borges, Fidel Castro, Martin Luther King, Jr., Kate Millett, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and also personal missives to fans, critics, editors, friends, family and ordinary people. Dwight Gardner calls it a collection of \\"mostly minor gleanings from a major writer\\" that, however, has \\"umpteen pleasures to pluck out and roll between your teeth, like seeds from a pomegranate\\". It's a \\"scintillating read,\\" reviews John Winters, that gives readers a glimpse into Mailer's \\"extraordinary candor\\". John R. Coyne opines that Selected Letters is a \\"well-written and thoughtful study so comprehensive that it seemed to obviate the need for any further biographical data,\\" and Ronald Fried states that his letters shows Mailer's almost innocent notion that he could make the world better and they emerge \\"as essential to the work that would become his indelible contribution to America literature.\\" Norman Mailer: Works and Days (2000) received a Choice Magazine award for \\"outstanding scholarly title\\" in 2001, and has recently been expanded for a digital humanities project and a new edition, published by the Norman Mailer Society. Books he has edited include Critical Essays on Norman Mailer (1986), Conversations with Norman Mailer (1988), The James Jones Reader (1991, with James Giles), The Spooky Art: Some Thoughts on Writing (2003), and Norman Mailer‚Äôs Letters on An American Dream, 1963-69 (2004). His work has appeared in The New Yorker, The Paris Review, The Mailer Review, James Jones Literary Society Journal, Playboy, Creative Nonfiction, New York, Modern Fiction Studies, Modern Language Studies, The Chicago Tribune, Narrative, and The Journal of Modern Literature, among others. He co-authored with Mailer On God: An Uncommon Conversation (2007). Most recently, he edited Moonfire: The Epic Journey of Apollo 11 (Taschen 2009), an abridged version of Mailer's 1971 narrative, Of a Fire on the Moon, with hundreds of NASA photographs; and Norman Mailer/Bert Stern: Marilyn Monroe (Taschen 2011). Lennon also wrote about James Jones and edited (with James Giles) a collection of Jones' war writings, The James Jones Reader in 1991. He also co-produced (with Jeffrey Davis) a 1985 PBS documentary on Jones, James Jones: From Reveille to Taps, in which Mailer gave a key interview. Lennon and Davis assembled a 1987 piece on Jones for The Paris Review titled ‚ÄúGlimpses: James Jones, 1921-1977,‚Äù drawn from the documentary. Lennon, along with co-author Donna Pedro Lennon and editor Gerald R. Lucas, won the Robert F. Lucid Award for Mailer Studies in 2019 for the revised edition of Norman Mailer: Works and Days. Affiliations Lennon helped found The Norman Mailer Society and The James Jones Literary Society. He served as president of the former until 2017 and the latter until 1995. Lennon serves on the Executive Board of the Norman Mailer Center and the Norman Mailer Society. He is also the Chair of the Editorial Board of The Mailer Review. Personal life Lennon has been married to Donna Pedro Lennon, a Newporter who also attended the University of Rhode Island, since October 15, 1966. They are the parents of three sons, Stephen (1967), Joseph (1968) and James (1969), and four grandchildren and live in Westport, Massachusetts.

He was born in 1618 or 1619. Much research has been undertaken by various members of the Townsend family to trace Richard's origins but nothing is known about him before 1643 when he was appointed to command a company, as a Captain, in Colonel Ceely's Regiment, which had been raised to garrison Lyme Regis. Richard was engaged in several skirmishes, most notably on 3 March 1643 when he surprised and routed 150 Royalist cavalry at Bridport. Later, he was present during the defence of Lyme Regis 20 April ‚Äì 13 June 1644 where he distinguished himself and was promoted to Major (\\"he was shot in the head but still lives\\"). In 1645 he assumed command of Colonel Ceely's Regt when Colonel Ceely was returned to Parliament as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bridport. Richard took part in the siege of Pendennis Castle in August 1646 and afterwards wrote to Colonel Ceely to report on the siege and \\"to receive directions how to dispose of the regiment, and positively what employment and future maintenance we may expect\\". This letter is preserved in the Tanner MS in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Following the siege Richard was made Colonel of a regiment of 1000 men, raised for service in Ireland, with Robert Phayre as his Lieutenant Colonel and they remained camped near Bath until 19 June 1647 when Parliament ordered that \\"Colonel Townesend and his regiment ... be transported to Ireland\\" to join the Parliamentary Army in Ireland under the command of Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin. Ireland On 13 November 1647 Richard commanded the main body of the infantry at the Battle of Knocknanauss, near Mallow under Lord Inchiquin against the Irish army led by Theobald Taaffe, 1st Earl of Carlingford. Subsequently, Richard and others, in dire need of fresh supplies, joined with Lord Inchiquin in a Declaration of Remonstrance, which was submitted to Parliament in early 1648. Shortly after this Lord Inchiquin renounced his allegiance to the English Parliament and joined forces with Lord Taaff. Richard and several other officers disagreed with this and there followed a period of complex political and military intrigue during which loyalties to the Parliamentary cause and the Royalists were in a state of flux. The execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649 united all the factions in Ireland against Cromwell, but Richard and a number of other officers in Inchiquin's army (notably Colonel Gifford and Colonel Warden) were unable \\"to endure the thought of joining with the Irish against their own countrymen\\" and declared for Cromwell, who, having suppressed the uprisings in Kent, Wales and Scotland, was now in Ireland and marching on Munster. As Richard and the other Colonels were preparing Youghal to receive Cromwell, they were betrayed to Lord Inchiquin who arrested and imprisoned them in Cork. They were freed when the garrison in the town rose up in support of Cromwell on 16 October 1649, Later that month the 'Protestant Army of Munster' based in Cork drew up a Resolution to send to Cromwell pleading that they had been forced by Lord Inchiquin to serve the Irish cause. The first signature on the Resolution is that of Richard and Cromwell, on 14 November 1649, wrote to Speaker Lenthall that Colonel Townesend had been \\"an active instrument for the return of both Cork and Youghal to their obedience\\". Post-military life Richard retired from service sometime before 1654 and made extensive purchases of land; in all about . Following the restoration of Charles II in 1666 he was pardoned and hence escaped the forfeitures placed on many Cromwellian soldiers. His purchases of land were subsequently confirmed by royal patents in 1666, 1668 and 1680. He lived for a time at Kilbrittain Castle, near Courtmacsherry before finally settling at Castletown in about 1665. Castletown later came to be called Castle Townsend and from about 1870 Castletownshend. Richard was elected MP for Baltimore in the Irish Parliament, which met at Chichester House, Dublin in 1661. His appearances in the Parliament were infrequent and he was fined for non-attendance. In 1666, under threat of invasion by the French, the Duke of Ormonde, at the insistence of the Earl of Orrery, appointed Richard Commander of Militia in County Cork. Subsequently, he was appointed High Sheriff of County Cork on 12 March 1671 and Sovereign of Clonakilty on 18 October 1685. From the time that he moved from Kilbrittain Castle to Castletownshend until his death Richard sought to consolidate his estates in West Carberry and to lead the settled life of a landowner. However, these were unsettled times, particularly after the accession of James II in 1685, and Richard was frequently engaged in various armed skirmishes with Irish rebels. In 1690, under the command of Colonel O'Driscol, the rebels unsuccessfully besieged Castletownshend but soon after it was attacked again by about 500 of them led by MacFineen O'Driscoll and Richard was forced to surrender. He was subsequently paid ¬£40,000 in compensation for the destruction of his home. Richard signed his will on 21 June 1692 \\"being sick in body but in perfect sense and disposing memory\\". He died on 26 September 1692 and was buried in the old churchyard at Castlehaven; his tomb lies in the chancel of the old church and is marked by a slab bearing the words 'This is the burial place of the Townesends'. It has always been the belief that Richard's first wife, Hildegardis Hyde, was a close kinswoman of Lord Clarendon; if this is correct it might help to explain how Richard's life and lands were spared during these troubled times when many of his friends and acquaintances fared very badly. The surname of Richard's second wife cannot be confirmed but there are good reasons to believe it to be Kingston; the Kingston family were settled near Bandon and Richard named his fifth son Kingston. Richard had a large family of which there were seven surviving sons. Of these it is only through his son Colonel Bryan Townsend that survivors in the male line exist today.

Scotland had a different Poor Law system to England and the workings of the Scottish laws differed greatly to the Poor Law Amendment Act which applied in England and Wales. In 1579, the Scottish Parliament passed an act which made individual parishes responsible for enumerating their own poor. More than merely enumerate, however, the purpose of the law was an \\"inquisition\\" into the circumstances of the individual poverty, so as to determine whether the poor were able to work, whether they had any other means of subsistence, and whether there were other persons, family or others, who might assist them. The laws at that time codified the need to assist the poor‚Äîbut at the same time as outlawing what were apparently considered public nuisances: begging and vagrancy. In 1595, Buttock Mail, a Scottish poor rate began to be levied. There was further legislation in 1597 which made the parishes rather than the church responsible for the administration of poor relief. In 1672, magistrates were ordered to build correction houses or workhousesIn Scotland the more common term for a workhouse was \\"poorhouse\\" so that beggars could be made to work. In 1843, a Commission of Enquiry was set up to suggest improvements to the Scottish Poor Law system. Proposals suggested included: *Setting up a Board of Supervision and Parochial Boards *The levying of a poor rate *Joint poorhouses in urban areas *An Inspector of the Poor who could examine requests for relief. Scottish Poor Law Act After the Act of Union, Scotland retained its distinct legal system and the Poor Law Amendment Act was not applied to Scotland. However, as in England it was necessary to reform the Poor Laws. A Commission of Inquiry was set up in 1843 to decide how to reform the system. This resulted in the 1845 Scottish Poor Law Act being passed. The Scottish Poor Law Act established parochial boards in parishes and towns and a central Board of Supervision in Edinburgh. In Scotland the able-bodied poor had no automatic right to poor relief as in England. The Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845 created a central Board of Supervision which had the ability to raise local taxes to cover Poor relief costs.BBC - History - Beneath the Surface: A Country of Two Nations Unlike in England, the Scottish pauper had a legal right to appeal if they were denied poor relief. Outdoor relief was common; however, mismanagement of the system meant that a more restricted system after 1868 which relied more on the poorhouse. The Archives and Special Collections at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow hold more than 1,000,000 applications for poor relief made by residents of Glasgow and the west of Scotland.

Beinecke Professor of Economics and Management at Yale School of Management. He has held two other business school deanships (University of Chicago Booth School of Business and University of Virginia Darden Graduate School of Business Administration) and was Senior Associate Dean at University of Michigan Ross School of Business. Snyder is a strong defender of management education, having stated that the MBA is the most successful professional degree in modern history based on its general value in developing an understanding of (i) markets and competition and (ii) organizations, networks, and leadership. He foresees a greater weight going forward on a ‚Äúthird competency‚Äù, i.e., the ability to navigate the complexities within and across societies. Snyder has been critical of the ‚Äústudents are customers‚Äù view of education, and has articulated an alternative view that sets expectations and emphasizes feedback. Snyder has had extraordinary success with various business school rankings. At Michigan, when he was Senior Associate Dean in charge of the MBA program and part of a team led by B. Joseph White, the school rose to the No. 2 spot on the BusinessWeek rankings. While at Virginia, Darden reached No. 9 in BusinessWeek. When Snyder arrived at Chicago in 2001, the school never had had a No. 1 ranking and was ranked No. 10 in BusinessWeek. In 2006, during his tenure at Chicago, the school moved to No. 1 in BusinessWeek and has continued to hold the position. Chicago also gained two No. 1 rankings in The Economist during his tenure. Snyder also is a prolific fundraiser. He first developed a reputation for fundraising at Darden, and later was called a business school turnaround specialist by The Wall Street Journal based on his performance at Darden and Chicago Booth. Early in his career, Snyder worked as an economist for the United States Department of Justice‚Äôs Antitrust Division. Yale University On July 1, 2011, Snyder became Dean and William S. Beinecke Professor of Economics and Management at Yale School of Management. In naming him to this position in January 2010, Yale University President Rick Levin stated: \\"Ted Snyder is widely regarded as the most successful business school dean in the nation. He brings experience, enthusiasm, and vision to the Yale School of Management, and he looks forward to maintaining the school‚Äôs tradition of preparing students for leadership in business and society by raising their awareness of the context in which business operates. Ted especially appreciates Yale‚Äôs openness to collaboration across its schools and departments and its strong institutional commitment to infusing its educational programs with global experiences and global awareness. Ted is also committed to advancing the curricular innovations begun by the SOM faculty three years ago.\\"http://news.yale.edu/2010/01/29/new-yale-som-dean-appointed- edward-snyder Jim Baron, chair of the faculty search committee, stated said that more than 30 business school deans around the world were called for advice on whom to consider and Mr. Snyder's name was the only one that kept popping up. According to Baron, Ted Snyder \\"was widely regarded by his peers as having done the best job in the last decade or so.\\" Snyder's stated aspirations for Yale School of Management are to have the school become recognized as: 1\\\\. The business school that is the most involved with its home university: eminent and purposeful Yale University. 2\\\\. The most global U.S. business school in ways that are differentiating and meaningful given how the world's economy has developed. 3\\\\. The best source of elevated leaders for escalating complexity in all sectors. Snyder's focus on globalization dates back to his appointment as the inaugural director of the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan, whose founding mission was to engage the university in transition economies such as China, India, Russia, and South Africa. During the early and mid-1990s the Davidson Institute worked directly with enterprises in these regions. =Global Network for Advanced Management= In his first year as Dean of Yale School of Management, Snyder significantly increased the global reach of the school through a number of innovative initiatives. These include Snyder's conceiving of and convening the Global Network for Advanced Management, a network of 29 top business schools from a spanning set of countries. The Global Network's implementation reflects the extreme fragmentation of the management education industry, with over 13,000 business schools in operation worldwide, and the limitations associated with the partnership model by which individual schools work with others on particular programs. The Global Network creates the infrastructure to connect top talent in a flattening world and enables the member schools to collaborate in numerous ways including co-developing cases on global enterprises, project courses, and student projects. The Global Network was officially launched in April 2012. During his first year at Yale School of Management, the school's faculty and the Yale Corporation approved a new Master of Advanced Management degree program. The one-year program draws applicants exclusively from the Global Network for Advanced Management who have completed at least the core of their MBA or equivalent, for an advanced degree at Yale. Both the Global Network and the Master of Advanced Management program have broadened the global diversity of the school, incorporating perspectives from countries on the horizon of economic development, including Indonesia, Turkey, Ghana, Ireland, and Brazil. Snyder also has strengthened the already strong connections between Yale School of Management and Yale University. For example, the business school offers joint courses with the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs and Yale Law School, and the Master of Advanced Management students meet regularly with participants in the Yale World Fellows Program, a complementary group of high-caliber international leaders on campus. In December 2013, Snyder led the school's move into Edward P. Evans Hall, the current home of Yale School of Management. The campus provides the school with outstanding classroom and function space, as well as state-of-the-art technological capabilities. It also enables the school to grow its three master-level programs (full-time MBA, executive MBA, and Master of Advanced Management) by 70%, which will help the school expand the scope of its programming. University of Chicago Snyder served as dean of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business from 2001 until 2010 and as George Shultz Professor of Economics from 2001 until 2011. During Snyder's time as Dean, Chicago's positioning became clear as a high integrity institution, known for its commitment to the hierarchy of ideas and the extraordinary professional development of its students. Positive outcomes in terms of financial performance, programmatic initiatives, and rankings followed naturally. =Financial performance= In November 2009, Snyder was on the receiving end of his second record-setting gift to a business school, the $300M gift from David Booth of Dimensional Fund Advisors to name the University of Chicago Booth School. During the announcement, Snyder identified David Booth as a great marketer, superb entrepreneur, and an extraordinary financial thinker. Snyder's remarks also quoted George Shultz and paraphrased Bob Dylan. The school's endowment grew from $197M at the start of his tenure to $475M at the end date, not including the effects of David Booth's gift. During his deanship, the cumulative operating surplus at Chicago Booth was $100.4M. This reflected strong performance in terms of program execution, overall management, and development. The PhD program endowment went from $2.7M in 2001, to over $15.0M as of June 2010. With the help of an array of committed donors, the school increased the MBA student scholarship budget by an average annual increase of 17.1% over nine budget cycles. It also more than doubled number of endowed professorships, and during Snyder's deanship, Chicago Booth enjoyed the highest retention of senior faculty in five decades. =Programmatic initiatives= During his tenure, Chicago Booth opened a permanent campus in London, was ready for the expansion of its Singapore campus, and opened the $125M Harper Center in Hyde Park, Chicago. The Becker Center and the Initiative on Global Markets were established during his deanship. The school launched the CRSP indices project, which should generate substantial guaranteed license revenues, and also launched the Nielsen Marketing database projects. =Rankings= Chicago Booth moved from 10th in the Businessweek rankings to 1st, and has held the No. 1 ranking since 2006. The school ranked in the top 10 in 74 of 78 rankings during his deanship. The Economist also ranked it No. 1 twice during his tenure. These rankings were significant for the school; while it had been well-ranked prior to his tenure, it never had received a No. 1 ranking. University of Virginia Snyder was the Dean and Charles C. Abbott Professor at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business from 1998 to 2001. At Darden, he directed an expansion of the school's MBA program, worked to improve the diversity of the student body, and significantly increased the school's executive education offerings. In his decanal role, Snyder was on the receiving end of what was at the time the largest gift in business school history, Frank Batten Sr.‚Äôs $60M gift in December 1999 to establish the Batten Institute. Other Snyder received his MA in public policy in 1978 and PhD in economics in 1984 from the University of Chicago. After a professional start as an economist with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, Snyder joined the faculty at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business in 1982. He served as a faculty member and later as Senior Associate Dean, and was also the founding director of the Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan, which studies emerging markets. His research interests include industrial organization, antitrust economics, law and economics, and financial institutions. He has published in many academic journals, and at Chicago Booth he co-taught \\"Economic Analysis of Major Policy Issues\\" with fellow economists Gary Becker, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1992, and Kevin Murphy, a 2005 MacArthur Fellow. He serves on the Colby College Board of Trustees. Family Snyder's father was a World War II bomber pilot and his mother was a high-school teacher.

A tenacious utility player who often started on the half-back flank, he was also considered one of the toughest and most effective \\"taggers\\" of the period\\"Taggers worth plenty ‚Äì to a man\\", Mike Sheahan on Monday, The Herald, 14 June 1982 and one of the hardest men to beat one-on-one in the league. O'Brien's tagging role embodied a who's who of top players of that era, including Ron Barassi, Bobby Skilton, Peter Hudson, Alex Jesaulenko, Peter Crimmins, Darrel Baldock, Roger Dean, John Sharrock, Des Tuddenham, Ted Whitten and John Northey. Recruited from West Coburg, O'Brien captained North Melbourne's under-19 side for two years before playing a handful of senior games as a half-forward flanker in the 1960 season. He was dropped to the reserves for the whole of 1961. In the lead-up to the 1962 season, O'Brien was invited to train by both Essendon and Footscray. O'Brien formally requested a clearance to Footscray, seeing that as an opportunity to again play at the senior level. This prompted a re-think by North Melbourne and he was retained, reinventing himself as a half-back flanker and utility player. He excelled in these roles, justifying North's decision to turn down the transfer. O'Brien became a stalwart in the Kangaroo side for the next eight seasons, and in 1964 was runner-up to Noel Teasdale in the Syd Barker Medal, North Melbourne's best and fairest award. In 1968, O'Brien was selected to represent Australia as part of the Australian Football World Tour, the second of the international rules football series against Ireland. In 1970, O'Brien joined Victorian Football Association (VFA) team Brunswick, and was appointed the dual role of captain-coach at the end of the 1971 season.\\"O'Brien coach of Brunswick\\", The Age, 25 November 1971 He led the side to a Second Division Grand Final appearance in 1973, after which he announced his playing days were over. O'Brien went on to serve in the North Melbourne match committee as a team selector under premiership coach Ron Barassi. While playing senior football, O'Brien studied to become a licensed realtor and auctioneer, eventually becoming a director and later partner of a real estate business in Melbourne, Victoria. He is now retired and lives in Gowanbrae, Victoria.

Established in 1861 as an active military unit, the Light Cavalry was reestablished in 1979 as a ceremonial unit for special events.  Early history  In 1861 the Light Cavalry Troop (initially a squadron) was added to the HAC. Apart from its military duties, the Light Cavalry formed the official mounted escort for the Lord Mayor of London. The Light Cavalry paraded for Princess Alexandra's visit to the city in 1861, the state visit of Tsar Alexander II in 1874 and was reviewed by Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace and in Windsor Castle in the 1880s. In 1890 the Light Cavalry Troop was converted into a unit of horse artillery by order of the War Office and was renamed Horse Artillery Battery, taking precedence over the HAC's existing field Battery. Current incarnation In 1979 a new ceremonial Light Cavalry unit was formed within the HAC. Its chief proponent was Major Gerald Flint- Shipman, an officer in the Territorial Army Royal Green Jackets and non- regimental member of the HAC, who became its first commander. The Light Cavalry was awarded the Royal Warrant from HM Queen Elizabeth in 2004. In 2020 the Light Cavalry comprises a headquarters and two Troops, each of three sections. The Light Cavalry parades in the Lord Mayor's show and also provides mounted and dismounted guards of honour for members of the royal family, the Lady Mayoress and the City of London Livery Companies, as well as other institutions, equestrian events, balls, dinners and film premieres.  Description  \\\\Military equestrian skills are taught and practiced by the Light Cavalry, preserving military drills of a Victorian cavalry. Members regularly participate in skill-at-arms and military equestrian events. Members wear full dress 19th century Hussar uniform with silver facings. A busby, traditional hussar headgear, is worn with ceremonial mounted and dismounted review order. In addition members may also be seen in frock order, mess kit and barrack dress for drill nights. Instruction is given in the use of traditional cavalry weapons of the era, the sword and lance. Supporting Riders Club The Light Cavalry also has a Supporting Riders Club based at their stables in Windsor Great Park. Here lessons and hacks are available to members of the club which can be civilians as well as military. Supporting Riders also help on parades.

It is restricted to the Brazilian state of Amazonas south of the Solim√µes river. Description Total length c. . As other members of the Pyrrhura picta complex, it is a long-tailed mainly green parakeet with a dark red belly, rump and tail-tip (tail all dark red from below), pale grey scaling to the chest, a whitish or dull buff patch on the auriculars and bluish remiges. The cheeks and crown are dark dusky-maroon (often appears almost blackish). Unlike other members of the P. picta complex, it lacks any bright red or blue to the head (but see Taxonomy). The legs are dark greyish. Habitat and behavior It occurs in tropical humid lowland forest and adjacent habitats. It is social and typically seen in pairs or groups. It feeds on fruits, seeds and flowers. The nest is placed in a tree cavity. It is likely to be fairly common within its range, but generally very poorly known, as the remote region where it occurs rarely is visited by ornithologists. Taxonomy It has typically been considered a subspecies of Pyrrhura picta. As with most other taxa in the P. picta complex, Joseph (2002) recommended that lucianii should be recognized as a monotypic species, P. lucianii. Ribas et al. (2006) did not include lucianii in their study, but did find that P. picta (sensu stricto) was closer to some members of the P. leucotis complex than to the various taxa found mainly south of the Amazon River and traditionally considered as subspecies of it. Consequently, Ribas et al. recommended that the west Amazonian taxa (roseifrons and peruviana) and the east Amazonian taxa (amazonum and snethlageae) should be considered two separate species. Based on biogeography, it therefore becomes unlike that P. lucianii is a subspecies of P. picta, but the possibility that it is better regarded as conspecific with either P. amazonum or P. roseifrons cannot be discounted on basis of current knowledge. P. lucianii was described before both P. amazonum and P. roseifrons, meaning that they, if one of these scenarios was found to be correct, would become subspecies of P. lucianii (i.e. P. lucianii amazonum or P. lucianii roseifrons). SACC voted to recognize P. lucianii as a species. Another problem relates to the population of the P. picta complex from far north-eastern Peru. These individuals with red to the forecrown have often (e.g. Juniper and Parr, 1998) been regarded as typical of P. lucianii. Joseph (2002) found that this was incorrect, with true P. lucianii being restricted to Brazil and lacking any bright red to the head. The taxonomic position of the population in far north-eastern Peru, labelled as \\"group 6\\" by Joseph (2002), therefore remains unclear, it having been speculated that it could be a distinct species, a subspecies of either P. roseifrons or P. lucianii, a hybrid between the P. roseifrons and P. lucianii (which, if found to be true, could indicate that P. lucianii and P. roseifrons are better considered conspecific), or a hybrid between the currently recognized subspecies of P. roseifrons. Arndt (2008) recently argued for treating it as a distinct species, which he described as P. parvifrons, but this has yet to receive widespread recognition (e.g. by SACC). References * Arndt, T.
