It is adjacent to and south of downtown and Interstate 30, east of Austin Street, north of Corinth Street, and west of the 75 & 345 Overpasses just east of South Good Latimer Expy.  History  The Cedars was originally developed in the 1870s with moderately-priced homes, but by the late 19th century the neighborhood had become one of the premier destinations in Dallas, with stately Victorian homes belonging to wealthy businessmen, lawyers, and politicians dotting the streets. The Cedars was also the home of Dallas' Jewish community, and the neighborhood included the Shaareth Israel synagogue. (Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus fame was born in the Cedars.) By the early 20th century, however, light industry and growing population pressures had begun to take the bloom off the neighborhood's rose, and most of the city's wealthiest began to move further north to neighborhoods northeast of downtown. Even as industry, such as the Sears-Roebuck warehouse that now is home of the South Side on Lamar lofts, moved in, fine homes continued to be built, especially for well-to-do members of the Jewish community. But by the 1920s, the massive Victorians of the late 19th century were gone, the synagogue was demolished, and most people moved on. In the 1960s, virtually all of the remaining homes were destroyed by the city for highway projects. Today, only a scant handful of homes (perhaps as few as six) from the neighborhood's original residents survive, none in restored condition. In addition to light industry, the area has been a haven for artists, musicians and urban dwellers for over 20 years. It has recently experienced the beginnings of an urban transformation with new townhomes, renovated warehouse lofts and apartments and developments such as DART's Cedars Station, the loft/retail development Southside on Lamar, Opening Bell Coffee & Music Venue Hosts to numerous Local and National Music Acts since March 2003Baby Back Shak the Dallas Police Headquarters, FULL CITY ROOSTER Coffee Roasting Studio, Cedar Performance European Automotive Repair (www.Cedar-Performance.com), Cedars Union, and entertainment venues Alamo Drafthouse, Mac's Southside, Lee Harvey's, Industry Alley Bar, Gilley's Dallas and Poor David's Pub. In June 2015, Cedars was the site of a shootout between Dallas Police Department officers and a mentally disturbed man who attacked the police headquarters building. The suspect, James Boulware, was the only casualty of the incident.

The term has a history of use reaching back to antiquity, but took on a strictly political concept when it was first used by Spinoza and reiterated by Machiavelli. The multitude is a concept of a population that has not entered into a social contract with a sovereign political body, such that individuals retain the capacity for political self-determination. A multitude typically is classified as a quantity exceeding 100. For Hobbes the multitude was a rabble that needed to enact a social contract with a monarch, thus turning them from a multitude into a people. For Machiavelli and Spinoza both, the role of the multitude vacillates between admiration and contempt. Recently the term has returned to prominence as a new model of resistance against global systems of power as described by political theorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri in their international best-seller Empire (2000) and expanded upon in their Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire (2004). Other theorists recently began to use the term include political thinkers associated with autonomist Marxism and its sequelae, including Sylvère Lotringer, Paolo Virno, and thinkers connected with the eponymous review Multitudes. History The concept originates in Machiavelli’s Discorsi. It is, however, with Hobbes's recasting of the concept as the war-disposed, dissolute pole of the opposition between a Multitude and a People in De Cive, that Spinoza’s conceptualization seems, according to Negri, contrasted.Negri, The Savage Anomaly, pp. 109, 140. The multitude is used as a term and implied as a concept throughout Spinoza's work. In the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, for instance, he acknowledges that the (fear of the) power (potentia) of the multitude is the limit of sovereign power (potestas): \\"Every ruler has more to fear from his own citizens […] than from any foreign enemy, and it is this 'fear of the masses' [... that is] the principal brake on the power of the sovereign or state.\\" The explication of this tacit concept, however, only comes in Spinoza's last and unfinished work known as the Political Treatise: > It must next be observed, that in laying foundations it is very necessary to > study the human passions: and it is not enough to have shown, what ought to > be done, but it ought, above all, to be shown how it can be effected, that > men, whether led by passion or reason, should yet keep the laws firm and > unbroken. For if the constitution of the dominion, or the public liberty > depends only on the weak assistance of the laws, not only will the citizens > have no security for its maintenance [...], but it will even turn to their > ruin. [...] And, therefore, it would be far better for the subjects to > transfer their rights absolutely to one man, than to bargain for > unascertained and empty, that is unmeaning, terms of liberty, and so prepare > for their posterity a way to the most cruel servitude. But if I succeed in > showing that the foundation of monarchical dominion [...], are firm and > cannot be plucked up, without the indignation of the larger part of an armed > multitude, and that from them follow peace and security for king and > multitude, and if I deduce this from general human nature, no one will be > able to doubt, that these foundations are the best and the true ones. The concept of the multitude resolves the tension that scholars have observed in Spinoza’s political project between the insistence on the benign function of sovereignty (as witnessed in the quotation above) and the insistence on individual freedom. It is, we see here, a truly revolutionary concept, and it is not difficult to see why Spinoza’s contemporaries (and, as for instance Étienne Balibar has implied, even Spinoza himself) saw it as a dangerous political idea. Reiteration by Negri and Hardt Negri describes the multitude in his The Savage Anomaly as an unmediated, revolutionary, immanent, and positive collective social subject which can found a \\"nonmystified\\" form of democracy (p. 194). In his more recent writings with Michael Hardt, however, he does not so much offer a direct definition, but presents the concept through a series of mediations. In Empire it is mediated by the concept of Empire (the new global constitution that Negri and Hardt describe as a copy of Polybius's description of Roman government): > New figures of struggle and new subjectivities are produced in the > conjecture of events, in the universal nomadism [...] They are not posed > merely against the imperial system—they are not simply negative forces. They > also express, nourish, and develop positively their own constituent > projects. [...] This constituent aspect of the movement of the multitude, in > its myriad faces, is really the positive terrain of the historical > construction of Empire, [...] an antagonistic and creative positivity. The > deterritorializing power of the multitude is the productive force that > sustains Empire and at the same time the force that calls for and makes > necessary its destruction. They remain however vague as to this \\"positive\\" or \\"constituent\\" aspect of the Multitude: > Certainly, there must be a moment when reappropriation [of wealth from > capital] and selforganization [of the multitude] reach a threshold and > configure a real event. This is when the political is really affirmed—when > the genesis is complete and self-valorization, the cooperative convergence > of subjects, and the proletarian management of production become a > constituent power. [...] We do not have any models to offer for this event. > Only the multitude through its practical experimentation will offer the > models and determine when and how the possible becomes real. In their sequel Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire they still refrain from a clear definition of the concept but approach the concept through mediation of a host of \\"contemporary\\" phenomena, most importantly the new type of postmodern war they postulate and the history of post-WWII resistance movements. It remains a rather vague concept which is assigned a revolutionary potential without much theoretical substantiation apart from a generic potential of love. Sylvère Lotringer has criticized Negri and Hardt's use of the concept for its ostensible return to the dialectical dualism in the introduction to Paulo Virno's A Grammar of the Multitude (see external links).

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality of Pandi lies north-east of Manila and is located at the eastern portion of Bulacan Province. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, Pandi is now included in the Greater Manila's built-up area which reaches San Ildefonso, Bulacan at its northernmost part. Pandi is one of the youngest towns in Bulacan. During the Spanish Regime, Pandi was a part of the political jurisdiction of the town of Meycauayan City including the towns of San Jose del Monte, Bocaue, Marilao, Valenzuela, Obando, Santa Maria, Balagtas, it also formed part of the vast Hacienda Santa Maria de Pandi, which included the towns of Santa Maria and Balagtas and parts of Angat and Bustos. Pandi was then a part of the town Balagtas (then Bigaa) until its formal separation and independence on April 17, 1946. History =Early history= Pandi was originally part of Hacienda of Dominicans named Hacienda which belongs to the Town Santa Maria de Pandi (now Santa Maria, Bulacan) In 1874 it was turn over to the town of Bigaa as one of its Barrio and the religious activity belongs to Convento de Bigaa under the auspices of Augustinian order established a chapel under the advocacy of Immaculate Concepcion. =The Republic of Kakarong de Sili= Inang Filipina Shrine During the Philippine Revolution, Pandi played a vital and historical role in the fight for Philippine independence, Pandi is historically known for the Real de Kakarong de Sili Shrine - Inang Filipina Shrine, the site where the bloodiest revolution in Bulacan took place, where more than 3,000 Katipunero revolutionaries died. Likewise, it is on this site where the 'Republic of Real de Kakarong de Sili' of 1896, one of the first Philippine revolutionary republics was established. It was in Kakarong de Sili, which about 6,000 Katipuneros from various towns of Bulacan headed by Brigadier General Eusebio Roque, a mysticist (albolaryo) better known as \\"Maestrong Sebio or Dimabungo\\"Halili 2004, p. 145. \\\\- List of Filipino Generals in the Philippine Revolution of 1896 and the Filipino-American War of 1899 that the Kakarong Republic was organized shortly after the Cry of Pugad Lawin referred to as 'The Cry of Balintawak' - Andres Bonifacio a Filipino nationalist and revolutionalist who led in 'The Cry of Balintawak'. The 'Kakarong Republic' was the first revolutionary government established in Bulacan to overthrow the Spaniards. These significant event have been included as of one of the attributes in the seal of the province of Bulacan. According to available records including the biography of General Gregorio del Pilar entitled \\"Life and Death of a Boy General\\" written by Teodoro Kalaw, former director of the National Library of the Philippines, an improvised fort was constructed at 'Kakarong de Sili' It had streets, an independent police force, a musical band, a factory of falconets, bolos and repair shops for rifles and cartridges. The 'Kakarong Republic' had a complete set of officials with Canuto Villanueva as Supreme Chief and 'Maestrong Sebio'- Eusebio Roque as Brigadaire General of the Army. The fort was attacked and totally destroyed on January 1, 1897 by a large Spanish force headed by General Olaguer- Feliu.Halili 2004, p. 145-146. Gen. Gregorio del Pilar was only a lieutenant at that time and 'The Battle of Kakarong de Sili' was his first \\"baptism of fire\\". This was where he was first wounded and escaped to nearby barangay 'Manatal'. After the Battle of Kakarong de Sili mysticist Eusebio Roque were arrested and transferred to Bulakan town where the seat of Alcaldia Mayor located and he was sentenced to death. The Kakarong Lodge No. 168 of the 'Legionarios del Trabajo' in memory of the 1,200 Katipuneros who perished in the battle erected a monument of the Inang Filipina Shrine - Mother Philippines Shrine in 1924 in the barrio of Kakarong. The actual site of the 'Battle of Kakarong de Sili' belongs to the administrative and geographical jurisdiction of Town of Bigaa and it was given to Pandi in 1946. The site is now a part of the barangay of 'Real de Kakarong'. No less than one of the greatest generals in the Philippines' history, General Emilio Aguinaldo who became first Philippine president visited this sacred ground in the late fifties. =The birth of the town of Pandi= The independence of Pandi as a new town of Bulacan was through the efforts of Mamerto Carpio Bernardo - (The Father of Pandi, Bulacan).

According to the , it has a population of people. Dubbed as the \\"Vinegar Capital of the Philippines\\", Paombong is famous for its vinegar extracted from the sap of sasa (nipa), thus the term \\"Sukang Paombong\\" (Paombong vinegar) became known in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines. Etymology Local legend has it that the name \\"Paombong\\" was taken from the long bamboo tube called \\"bumbong\\" or \\"tukil\\" which is used for collecting nipa sap. The practice of extracting nipa sap with bumbongs made the town known as the town with many bumbongs. The local people claimed that the Spaniards who first visited the place were so amused with the bumbong that, after learning its name from the natives, they named the town after the container, a name which later evolved to Paombong. History Paombong was originally one of the visitas (barrio) of Malolos mentioned in Capitulo XXXVI of Conquistas de Las Islas libro segundo by Fray Gaspar San Agustin. In a meeting held in Tondo Convent, the Provincial Chapter created the Town of Malolos in June 1580 with Fray Matheo de Mendoza OSA as its first minister, together with Barrios of Mambog under the patronage of San Roque,Matimbo with Santa Cruz and Paombong with Saint James Apostle. In 1619 Augustinians already established Paombong Convent but the town was administered by the justice of friars from Malolos. Paombong is not wealthy as its neighbor towns of Malolos and Hagonoy at time and it did not sustain its township and it was degraded again as barrio and being a visita in 1638. In 1639 Paombong was turned over to the Town of Calumpit from its mother town Malolos and in 1649 it was returned again to Malolos but on November 28, 1650 it was finally given its own civil government establishing Paombong its full township with Don Agustin Mananghaya as its first Gobernadorcillo. In the middle of the 1750s, Paombong grew into a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs. as its first gobernadorcillo. During the Revolution against Spain, Paombong’s coastal area, more specifically, Barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldiers and Katipuneros. Maloleño General Isidoro \\"matanglawin\\" Torreshttp://philippine- revolution.110mb.com/torres_detailed.htm used to retreat with his troops to Barangay Masukol and Barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces. In the latter village, he organized the Katipunan militia of Paombong. It is from these encounters, in fact, that Barangays Binakod and Masukol earned their present names. In one encounter, Binakod was where the enemies where \\"fenced in\\" (binakuran) and it was in Masukol where they were eventually \\"cornered\\" (nasukol) and defeated. In 1898, the first civilian in the person of Don Victorio de Leon headed the Municipal Government until 1900. The seat of the local government was first established at the ground floor of the Paombong Church Convent then popularly called \\"zaguan\\". It was later transferred to the house of Numerino Lindayag located in Poblacion, then was transferred to the location of the present Rural Health Center I. Eventually it was moved to the place where it is presently located which since has been the seat of the Municipal Government since then. In 1941, the head of the Municipal Government was later on called Municipal Mayor. Geography Paombong is situated south-west of the province of Bulacan, with a total land area of 46.34 square kilometers.

According to the , it has a population of people. With the expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's built-up area which reaches as far north as San Ildefonso, Bulacan. History Quingua Church built in 1602 is dedicated to the apostle James the Greater, and named after Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Like many towns in Bulacan, Plaridel has its niche in Philippine history as the site of the Battle of Quingua during the Philippine-American War as part of the defense of the First Philippine Republic against the Northern Campaign of the American Army. The battle, manned by Pablo Tecson—Lt. Colonel Pablo Ocampo Tecson of San Miguel, Bulacan—under Gregorio del Pilar on the side of the First Philippine Republic, led to the death of Col. John Stotsenberg of the American Army on April 23, 1899. A marker now stands at the site of the battle in Barangay Agnaya. Plaridel's history can be traced through records back to 1581 in the early years of the Spanish colonization. The Augustinian friars from Malolos Convent discovered a vast forest in 1581 then named as Binto; this would later be known as Quingua. As per the history of the Parish of St. James the Apostle, 2001 issue, Quingua was established by the Augustinian Friars of Malolos who initially named it \\"Encomienda Binto\\" (Barangay Bintog got its name from this settlement). They built a visita (chapel of ease) and placed it under the jurisdiction of Fray Mateo Mendoza, the prior of Malolos. The visita of Binto was elevated to an independent parish named Parroquia de Santiago Apostol, and the whole of Quingua was separated from Malolos and was created as a new pueblo on September 27, 1602. Plaridel is surrounded with the rivers of Angat, Bulacan and Tabang River, both of which run through the town. The Angat River, otherwise known as Bulacan River, flows directly to Calumpit, Bulacan, meeting the Pampanga River. The Tabang River, a tributary with adjoining intersections dividing the middle of the present poblacion of Plaridel, flows to the Manila Bay after passing through the towns of Guiguinto and Bulakan. The water of this river was called \\"tabáng\\" to refer to its fresh water. Initially very few people lived in the town, and most were closely related. Each group had a leader called \\"tandis\\". Different groups spoke different languages; Pampango, Pangasinan, Ilocano and Tagalog. From Malolos, the friar curate frequently visited the place, preaching the Catholic faith, using the \\"balsa\\" or bamboo raft as his means of transportation. The missionaries decided to clear the land and establish settlements, from which they could work to bring unity to the people. They needed ideas to bring this about, so each \\"tandis\\" drew up a plan to pursue. The groups of people labored, so much so that when the priest returned seven years later, he found the area completely cleared. The priests's party inquired among the natives as to whom the credit should go, and the Pampangos exclaimed, \\"Quing wawa\\". Thereafter, every now and then, to every question of the friars the people would reply \\"Quing wa\\". As a consequence, the place had come to be referred to as Quingua. During the presidency of Manuel L. Quezon, the then \\"Alcalde\\", or Town Mayor, of Quinga, Jose J. Mariano, took the initiative of renaming the town. Congressman Pedro Magsalin, a friend of the Alcalde, sponsored the bill changing the name of the town from Quingua to Plaridel. The bill was passed by the Philippine Congress and was approved by the President, and on December 29, 1936 the town was renamed as 'Plaridel', in honor of the great hero of Bulacan, Marcelo H. del Pilar. The celebrations that followed were attended by political luminaries of the time, including Speaker Gil Montilla, Congressman Magsalin, Nicolas Buendia, Eulogio Rodriguez, Elpidio Quirino and Governor José Padilla, Sr. Notable families from Plaridel include the Vergel de Dios family (originally from Baliuag and that donated the public market of the town), the Castros, Vistans, Sayos, Garcías, and San Diegos. Barangays Plaridel is divided into 19 barangays. In 1954, sitio Mayamot in Barrio Banga was changed to Bagong Silang while a sitio in the eastern part of barrio Tabang, called Bagong Silang, was created. Climate Demographics In the , the population of Plaridel, Bulacan, was people, with a density of . Attractions =Parish Church of Santiago Apostol= The Plaridel Church was initially a mission chapel built by the Augustinians in Malolos made of light materials. The Chapel was located near River at Lumang Bayan and transferred to present site. It is clearly evident why the said Barrio named Lumang Bayan means-Old Poblacion. From 1590 to 1602, Quingua was administered by Friar Curate from Malolos Church which close at hand. The present church was built in 1602 and established as the town church of the newly created Pueblo de Quingua. Plaridel is one of the earliest settlement to be established at around 1590 as Encomienda. Its Parish Church of Santiago Apostol has one of the unique Moorish architectural style among the Augustinian Churches in the province. It was here that the money and jewels of san Agustin in Intramuros, Manila were kept during British Occupation in 1762-63. The church is small and its two level facade is bare. However, the crowning pediment is elaborate consisting of a pair of volutes with the inner space filled with triangular patterns and floral embellishments that first glance can be mistaken as having a Moorish influence because of the minaret like dome formed. In between the volutes are a series of spaced relieves of cherubs, ramilletes, two saints including that of St. Agustin and the pierced heart which is the symbol of the Agustinia Order. The octagonal and tapering belltower on the other hand sits on a quadrilateral base and rises 4 levels. The Parish Church of Santiago Apostol is the location of GMA Network's Fantaserye Darna (2009), Zaido (2007), Iglot (2011) and afternoon drama series, Nita Negrita (2011), Broken Vow (2012).

According to the , it has a population of people. History =Spanish era= The San Juan de Dios Church still stands as the silent witness of the bloody battles that the Filipino insurgents fought during the Philippine Revolution of 1896. This church was used as military barracks for almost three days, after the insurgents had destroyed all papers and documents they found in the convents. When the Spanish Cazadores learned of these rebellious activities, they entered the church and fought the insurgents. The combatants fought heavily inside the church to a point that blood was spilled all over the church floor. The patio in front of the church was littered by dead bodies of Filipino insurgents. The gobernadorcillo ordered people to dig a common grave near the church for the bodies of the insurgents. =American influence= The Americans succeeded the Spaniards with their policy of benevolent assimilation. Schools were established as a potent factor for pacification. In 1903, schools were opened in San Rafael. The municipal building was used as a school house. Since then, with the supervision of the American administrators, San Rafael has enjoyed the education and the progress which was denied to them during the three–century rule of the Spaniards. In 1899, the Americans incorporated the town to Baliwag when Baliwag was intended to be the Provincial Capital of Bulacan. However, due to a number of petitions of the people of San Rafael, especially when the plan to make Baliwag the capital of Bulacan did not materialize, the Americans where convinced to separate San Rafael as an independent town from Baliwag. Mr. Julian V. Valte was appointed to be the first Presidente Municipal of San Rafael, and Mr. Emilio Reyes was the last. In the year 1924 and 1927, with the help of some influential men, the Spaniards were able to get the signatures of the land owners of San Rafael and San Ildefonso to an agreement purporting to show their willingness to donate their lands to the Hospital of San Juan de Dios. Thus the town of San Rafael and San Ildefonso became properties of the hospital and started to be called Hacienda de Buenavista until 1944, when it got back its original name. =Japanese occupation= The Commonwealth of the Philippines was invaded by the Empire of Japan in December 1941 shortly after Japan's declaration of war upon the United States of America, which controlled the Philippines at the time and possessed important military bases there. The combined American- Filipino army was defeated by April 1942. In May, 1942, the Japanese government opened schools and introduced the teaching of Nippon-go. As part of its war drive, Japanese propaganda included phrases like \\"Asia for the Asians!\\" and talked about the perceived need to liberate Asian countries from imperialist powers. Similarly, the Philippines were propagandized about \\"American exploitation,\\" \\"American Imperialism,\\" and \\"American tyranny,\\" and blame was laid on the United States for starting the war. They were assured that the American forces would not return and that they were not Japan's enemies. The effect of this was considerably undermined by the actions of the Japanese Army, and the Filipinos soon waited for the return of the Americans to free them from the Japanese. Japanese education condemned anything American, tried to infuse Japanese culture and to teach Filipinos the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under the Japanese influence. Socio–economic, educational and religious programs were largely non-existent. The people were deprived of property, food, supplies and shelter. They were forced or resorted to eat camote, wore jute sacks and tattered clothes. The people of San Rafael evacuated to Upig, Licheria, Coral na Bato and Camachile. Schools were closed and the church was ordered to stop performing its religious duties. Guerrilla resistance against the Japanese continued throughout the war. Uncaptured Filipino army units, a communist insurgency and supporting American agents all played a role in the resistance. The people of San Rafael refused to be subjected to Japanese authority and they organized and joined small guerrilla bands and harassed the units of the Japanese army stationed in the town whenever there was a chance to do so. These small, organized guerrillas in San Rafael later became members of BMA (Bulacan Military Area). =The liberation of San Rafael= When the American forces landed in Leyte in October, 1944, the Japanese became more brutal. Hundreds met their death in the hands of the enemy. One cruel incident occurred at Barrio Pulo. Men and women who were assembled where tied together, dynamites were strapped to many of them and these were later detonated by the Japanese captors. A lone survivor, Marcelo Mangahas, told the world of the gory incident. Other atrocities followed. However, the unity of the people of San Rafael and the heroism of the Filipino soldiers and guerrillas prevented further casualties and destruction. When the Americans arrived, they found San Rafael liberated by the courageous guerrillas with the Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 32nd, 35th and 36th Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiment that were mostly from San Rafael. Local Filipino troops of the 32nd, 35th and 36th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated the town in San Rafael, Bulacan and aided the guerrillas of the Bulacan Military Area (BMA) and defeated Japanese soldiers and aftermath in World War II. Barangays San Rafael is politically subdivided into 34 barangays (5 urban, 29 rural). Climate Demographics In the , the population of San Rafael, Bulacan, was people, with a density of . Tourism The 8 Waves Waterpark & Hotel is the prime resort of the Town, and is one of the biggest in the Philippines. The Big Rock Farm Resort is another notable resort of the Town which is located in Barangay Coral na Bato.

Festivals Every year, the town celebrates its Angel Festival in honor of their 2nd patron saint, Saint Raphael, together their town's pride, the Angel Festival, which attracts many tourists every year. It is a colorful celebration in honor of the Seven Archangels. This is held every 29 September.

Development Development began in July 1961 with the government assigning the project to two design teams: Tula and Kolomna. The requirements were: * Vehicle mountable and/or man portable * Range of 3,000 meters * Armor penetration of 200 millimetres at 60° * Maximum weight of 10 kilograms The designs were based on the Western ATGMs of the 1950s, such as the French ENTAC and the Swiss Cobra. In the end, the prototype developed by the Kolomna Machine Design Bureau, who were also responsible for the AT-1 Snapper, was chosen. Initial tests were completed by 20 December 1962, and the missile was accepted for service on 16 September 1963.  Description  The missile can be fired from a portable suitcase launcher (9P111), ground vehicles (BMP-1, BRDM-2) and helicopters (Mi-2, Mi-8, Mi-24, Soko Gazelle). The missile takes about five minutes to deploy from its 9P111 fibreglass suitcase, which also serves as the launching platform. The missile is guided to the target by means of a small joystick (9S415), which requires intensive training of the operator. The operator's adjustments are transmitted to the missile via a thin three-strand wire that trails behind the missile. The missile climbs into the air immediately after launch, which prevents it from hitting obstacles or the ground. In flight, the missile spins at 8.5 revolutions per second—it is initially spun by its booster, and the spin is maintained by the slight angle of the wings. The missile uses a small gyroscope to orient itself relative to the ground; as a result, the missile can take some time to bring back in line with the target, which gives it a minimum range of between 500 and 800 m. For targets under 1,000 m, the operator can guide the missile by eye; for targets beyond this range the operator uses the 8x power, 22.5-degree field of view 9Sh16 periscope sight. The engagement envelope is a 3 km, 45-degree arc centered on the missile's launch axis. At ranges under 1.5 km, this arc reduces until, at the 500 m range, the missile can only hit targets 50 m either side of the center line. Accuracy falls off away from the launch axis—falling to approximately half its optimal accuracy at the extremes. While early estimates of the missile hitting the target ranged from 60 to 90%, experience has shown that it can drop to an efficiency between 2 and 25% in case of less than optimal conditions and lack of skill from the operator. In fact, MCLOS requires considerable skill on the part of the operator, nevertheless, the weapon has always been quite popular with its operators and has enjoyed a constant updating effort both in the Soviet Union/Russia and in other countries. The two most serious defects of the original weapon system are its minimum range of between 500 and 800 m (targets that are closer cannot be effectively engaged) and the amount of time it takes the slow moving missile to reach maximum range—around 30 seconds—giving the intended target time to take appropriate action, either by retreating behind an obstacle, laying down a smoke-screen, or by returning fire on the operator. Later versions of the missile addressed these problems by implementing the much easier to use guidance system (though only available for ground vehicle and helicopter mounts), as well as upgrading the propulsion system to increase the average flight speed. The latest updates sport tandem warheads or probes in order to counteract explosive reactive armor, as well as thermal imaging systems. Even in these latest version, the Malyutka is probably the most inexpensive ATGM in service, with unitary price caps in the order of hundreds of dollars instead of the tens of thousands of the latest third generation models. The turret of a BMP-1 with a 9M14M missile  History  In Soviet service, the man-portable version was deployed as part of the anti-tank platoon of motor rifle battalions. Each platoon had two Malyutka sections, each with two teams. Each team had two launcher stations. One assistant gunner in each team served as an RPG-7 gunner. The RPG-7 was needed to cover the 500 meter deadzone created by the minimum range of the missile. It is also an integrated part of the BMP-1, BMD-1, and BRDM-2 vehicles. Yugoslav People's Army Malyutkas overlooking Dubrovnik during its siege on 9 December 1991 =Vietnam War= On 23 April 1972, the recently organized Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 20th Tank Regiment was attacked by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) employing the 9M14M Malyutka anti-tank guided missile for the first time.Dunstan The 20th was the only South Vietnamese armor unit equipped with the M48 Patton tank. This first employment of the Malyutka destroyed one M48A3 and one M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV), and a second ACAV was damaged. During this engagement with the weapon, the ARVN tankers appeared fascinated by the missile's slow and erratic flight, but through experience, they soon deployed counter measures against the weapon system. Upon launching by the enemy, ARVN crewmen would fire all their weapons towards the Sagger's firing position, which would make the gunner flinch and lose control of his missile. Although the gunner could take cover away from the launch site, the joystick control wire only allowed 15 meters of clearance. During the engagement, the ARVN eventually lost eight tanks to the 9M14M missile, but had developed tactics to defend themselves against it. During the Battle of Cửa Việt, the PAVN put up fierce resistance to the attack, destroying 26 M-48s and M-113s with AT-3 missiles. =Yom Kippur War= The missile was employed by Arab armies during the initial phases of the Yom Kippur War.Tucker, Spencer, C, The Encyclopedia of Middle East Wars, ABC-CLIO, LLC, (Santa Barbara California, 2010), p. 158, Later in the war, the Israelis adopted new tactics and learned to neutralize the Sagger threat by employing large concentrations of artillery fire to either distract or kill the Sagger operators. Other improvised methods used by the Israelis to defeat the Saggers involved firing in front of the tank to create dust, moving back and forth and firing at the source of Sagger fire.Rabinovich, Abraham, The Yom Kippur War: The Epic Encounter That Transformed The Middle East, Random House, p.140 These Israeli tactics were later adopted by NATO forces to counter the threat posed by Warsaw Pact ATGMs. In total, Saggers knocked out more than 800 Israeli tanks and other combat vehicles during the war.\\"PTUR suhoputnih voisk\\", G.N.Dmitriev, Arhiv-Press, 1997, pp.10(Russian:ПТУР Сухопутных войск / Под ред. Г. Н. Дмитриева. — Киев: Архив-Пресс, 1997. — С. 10. — (Архив 500+). — 700 экз.) Some experts and Israeli eyewitnesses have debated the effect of the Sagger during the Yom Kippur War. Several photos of Israeli tanks draped with guidance wires from Saggers while still operating successfully exist. In addition numerous veterans of the war describe being shot at by up to eight Sagger gunners at once without a single hit on their tanks. Veteran Israeli tankers reported that the RPG 7 was a much more destructive and feared weapon in the conflict than the Sagger, largely due to its single man portability and its greater accuracy within in its effective envelope compared to that of the Sagger. =Libyan Civil War= Rebels of the Free Libyan Army have been filmed using Saggers during the Libyan Civil War. =Syrian Civil War= Syrian rebels have also uploaded videos of their Sagger firings against government forces since late 2012.

It has a black body (approximately long) and white head. It has white primary feathers that form a crescent in flight. Males have a red spot at the back of the head. Some taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to place this species in the genus Picoides. The range of the white-headed woodpecker stretches in the mountains from British Columbia through southern California. They form nests in dead trees or snags and reproduce once per year. Most of the range is occupied by the nominate subspecies. In the southern part of the range, L. a. gravirostris, which has a longer bill - especially in males - and tail, is only found on mountaintops of the San Gabriel Mountains to San Diego County. Birds on Mount Pinos are somewhat intermediate. mtDNA cytochrome b and ATP synthase subunit 6 sequence data confirms this arrangement and also suggests that the Mount Pinos birds are closer to L. a. gravirostris (Alexander & Burns, 2006). Apparently, the larger bill of the southern subspecies is an adaptation for being better able to feed on the large, spiny cones of Coulter pines (Pinus coulteri).

It was originally developed by German scientist Josef Sauter in the late 1920s.Sauter J. \\"Die Grössenbestimmung der in Gemischnebeln von Verbrennungskraftmaschinen vorhandenen Brennstoffteilchen\\" VDI-Forschungsheft Nr. 279 (1926) und Nr. 312 (1928) It is defined as the diameter of a sphere that has the same volume/surface area ratio as a particle of interest. Several methods have been devised to obtain a good estimate of the SMD. SMD is typically defined in terms of the surface diameter, ds: :d_s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{A_p}{\\\\pi}} and volume diameter, dv: :d_v = \\\\left(\\\\frac{6 V_p}{\\\\pi}\\\\right)^{1/3}, where Ap and Vp are the surface area and volume of the particle, respectively. If ds and dv are measured directly by other means without knowledge of Ap or Vp, Sauter diameter for a given particle is :SD = D[3,2] = d_{32} = \\\\frac{d_v^3}{d_s^2}. If the actual surface area, Ap and volume, Vp of the particle are known the equation simplifies further: :\\\\frac{V_p}{A_p} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi (d_v/2)^3}{4\\\\pi (d_s/2)^2} = \\\\frac{(d_v/2)^3}{3 (d_s/2)^2} = \\\\frac{d_{32}}{6} :d_{32} = 6\\\\frac{V_p}{A_p}.

It specialises in general and business aviation and is home to Oxford Aviation Academy, formerly Oxford Aviation Training, the largest air training school in Europe. It is the only ICAO-listed civilian airport in Oxfordshire. Historically dominated by pilot training, in 2008, flying activity fell to just 48,000 movements, the lowest level on record and a 70% decline in 10 years, however, growth in business aviation was the fastest of any UK airport for the years up to 2012. Oxford (Kidlington) Aerodrome is an EASA Certified Airport that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the Certificate Holder (Oxford Aviation Services Limited). History The airport was originally established in 1935 by Oxford City Council to act as municipal airport, but following RAF use (as RAF Kidlington) during World War II, it became established as a centre for aviation education, charter and maintenance facilities.

Winter 2008 issue, GROW Online, Wisconsin's Magazine for the Life Sciences. “I couldn’t function in the dark, but he 'sees,'\\" says Dr. Nancy Barklage, who recalls entering a room prior to a UW Health staff meeting, turning on the lights and finding Cordes quietly working on his laptop while waiting for others to arrive. “I’ve experienced this a number of times now and it still kind of puts you into his reality.” As an infant, he was diagnosed with Leber's disease, a rare degenerative condition of the retina that gradually steals one's sight. Cordes still remembers one of the first times he heard someone trying to explain how his impending blindness would affect his life. “Your son can be president of the United States, but he’s never going to fly a plane or drive a car,” an ophthalmologist explained to his parents when Cordes was about 7. “And as a young boy who liked planes and cars, that was one of my first indications that things wouldn’t necessarily go smoothly,” says Cordes. “That made me sad.” He never did fly a plane or drive a car. In fact, when most of his friends in Cedar Falls, Iowa, were learning to drive, a 16-year-old Cordes got his first guide dog, a German shepherd named Electra. But Cordes didn't shrink from life. He's now a 34-year-old trailblazing physician who is wrapping up the third year of a four-year residency program with UW-Madison's department of psychiatry. “He has overcome challenges that most of us have just never been faced with,” says Barklage, an associate professor of psychiatry who has supervised Cordes’ work at UW Health's Psychiatric Institute and Clinic the past three years. Cordes has been reticent to share his story, not wanting to become a poster boy for overcoming visual disabilities. But he's slowly becoming more at ease telling his inspirational tale. Earlier this spring, the husband and father of two young boys wowed 450 members of the Madison Civics Club with a speech at Monona Terrace titled, “How I See Possibilities.” In July, he'll give a similar talk in Dallas at the National Federation of the Blind's annual convention. And he contributed a chapter for a book to be published later this summer by the Association of American Medical Colleges that is designed to guide medical schools in accommodating students with disabilities. Cordes’ chapter deals with the use of service animals. “Thirteen years ago, I was knocking on a lot of closed doors,” Cordes says of his struggles to have medical schools seriously consider him as a candidate for admittance. “So the fact a book is coming out describing the issues people with disabilities face and ways to accommodate them, I think is tremendous progress.” Cordes was valedictorian of his class at the University of Notre Dame in 1998, posting a 3.99 GPA while earning an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and conducting research on antibiotics. He then was accepted into the UW School of Medicine and Public Health's medical scientist training program, completing the notoriously challenging sequence that requires a student to finish both medical school and a Ph.D.-level research program. Over the years, Cordes also earned black belts in jujitsu and tae kwon do, carried the Olympic torch during its cross-country journey to the Salt Lake City Games in 2002, and developed computer software that uses a number of musical instruments, varying tones and left-right speakers to allow those with vision problems to conceptualize and study protein structures. Despite these made-for-the-big- screen qualities to his life, Cordes remains leery of being put on a pedestal: “I look forward to a world where people with disabilities do what they can and what they want, and it’s not exciting or it’s not different.” Dr. Brad Schwartz still remembers the paperwork Cordes forwarded to the UW Medical School when applying to the medical scientist training program. While most attempting to head down this path are high achievers, Schwartz says Cordes stood out from the pack due to his Medical College Admission Test scores, 3.99 GPA in a demanding major and his interesting research on antibiotics. It was a reference letter from a Notre Dame researcher, however, that floored Schwartz, who was director of the program in the spring of 1998. “It’s just this incredible, glowing letter,” says Schwartz, now the dean of the University of Illinois-Urbana's College of Medicine. “And then you get to the last line, and it says, ‘This is all the more remarkable because Tim is blind.’ We’re all thinking, 'Oh my God!'\\" Schwartz says his admissions review committee agreed Cordes was a \\"one-in-a-million\\" candidate and assumed \\"every program in the country would be fighting to get him because he was so remarkable.\\" But that wasn't the case. In fact, Cordes applied to eight schools, but no one else showed interest. During one med school exit interview, doctors and researchers at a rival Big Ten Conference institution made it clear to Cordes, who has only a limited amount of light perception, that there was no way a blind student could complete the school's required coursework and rotations to earn a medical degree. Cordes doesn't appear bitter about these rejections, but his mother, Therese Cordes, acknowledges it was a difficult time for her son. “To have someone tell Tim he’s not good enough, despite all he accomplished, was very, very tough on him,” she says. Even at UW-Madison, those close to the situation say some top medical school administrators were adamantly opposed to admitting Cordes. Concerns centered on two factors: the cost to make all the necessary accommodations for a blind student; and the fear that the Association of American Medical Colleges might frown on a school admitting a student who couldn't see. In the end, Schwartz stood his ground against the naysayers and Cordes was ultimately one of 143 students earning a slot in med school out of 2,300 who applied. Although no official records are kept and there are various scales to measure the extent of vision loss, published reports in 1998 indicated Cordes was only the second blind person ever admitted to a U.S. medical school. The first was David Hartman, a 1976 Temple grad and psychiatrist in Virginia whom Cordes considers a role model. Some members of the Medical School were guarded about Cordes’ chances of success at first, says Schwartz. “But I can tell you, each year that he went along he won over more and more people,” he says. In the years to come, Cordes would learn the lessons and complete the tasks asked of every other doctor-in-training. In the classroom, he used books on tape and in Braille to learn the fundamentals. He also relied heavily on a computer that could read downloaded texts and e-mails at a blistering 500 words per minute — something Cordes can easily understand but would sound like gibberish to someone accustomed to normal- paced speech. The university also provided him with a machine — “It looks a little like an Easy-Bake oven,” says Cordes — that makes raised-line drawings so he could interpret images using his sense of touch. In the lab, he helped dissect a human cadaver and used his fingers to identify the various nerves, muscles and organs. “I was the guy who reached into the chest and pulled out the lungs,” says Cordes. When it came to hospital rotations, he helped deliver babies (earning Student of the Year honors in the obstetrics and gynecology rotation), observed surgery — “I felt blood flowing through an aorta” — and intubated patients during an anesthesiology rotation. The school also hired “visual describers” to tag along with Cordes and his seeing-eye dog to help Cordes read paper charts or act as his eyes during a physical exam. In 2004, he earned the title of medical doctor. His Ph.D. work centered on biomolecular chemistry and the makeup of proteins, a field that relies heavily on colorful, computer-generated models of complex molecular structures. Out of necessity, Cordes wrote a computer program that replicates the 3-D images using a range of audio tones and surround-sound speakers, allowing him to “visualize” the proteins in his head. In 2007 he earned his Ph.D. Although Cordes isn't one to puff out his chest and say “I told you so,” he is proud of the fact he never allowed others to squash his dreams. “Choosing to ignore what other people say, when they say it can’t be done, is a powerful tool,” says Cordes. When Cordes started his medical school journey more than a decade ago, he had no desire to work directly with patients. Research was his passion, and the medical scientist training program is designed to develop people who can bridge the gap between basic research and clinical work. “I think it was just intellectual curiosity,” Cordes said of the research-first focus. But while working his way through the various rotations during his third year of medical school, Cordes started to zero in on a specialty and re-think his career options. He knew he couldn't be a radiologist but thought any other area was up for grabs. A four-week psychiatry rotation at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital stood out. “I was lucky and had a really great psychiatrist running the ward I was on,” Cordes says of Dr. Tony Braus. “Some of the patients we saw there really got better in a relatively short time, and we could see some improvements in people.” While he enjoyed interacting with the patients, Cordes also saw the potential to conduct groundbreaking research in the study and treatment of mental disorders. “There is just a lot we don’t know,” he says. “In other places of medicine, some of the more fundamental questions have been asked and answered, but in psychiatry we are just starting to ask them.” So after earning his M.D. and Ph.D., Cordes in 2007 entered a four-year, psychiatry research track residency program, which allows him to spend time working with patients and conducting research. Although he notes there has been no single “ah-ha” moment, Cordes says it's becoming clear his desire to work as a clinician and teacher of future doctors is stronger than his drive to focus solely on research. Cordes’ typical week currently consists of two-and-a-half days at the Veterans Hospital, where he helps supervise the medical interns in an inpatient psychiatry unit, and one full day of outpatient care at a UW Health clinic in University Research Park, where he oversees more than 100 patients. He also spends a half-day attending lectures and gets one full day for research. His research mainly consists of mining data and searching for interesting patterns using the http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/00203\\">Midlife Development in the United States survey, which examines the lives of people ages 30 to 70 in such areas as physical health, psychological well-being and factors that might lead to mental illness. At the Veterans Hospital, he also worked on a clinical trial systematically rating symptoms in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. While he has a proven track record as a researcher, Cordes is also earning kudos as a clinician. “In psychiatry, part of what we do is getting to know patients, establishing a rapport and trying to understand what’s going on with them so we can help them out,” says Art Walaszek, the residency training director for UW-Madison's department of psychiatry. “And Tim just has an incredible, natural ability to put people at ease and communicate and listen to them. I don’t know exactly how he does it, but he just has this awareness of what’s going on with the patient.” Body language and expressions often convey information to therapists, but Cordes is able to pick up on these cues despite his sight limitations. He says he's “gotten good at listening to people — not just what they’re saying but hearing how their body moves or what direction they’re talking in.” Colleagues say they can't recall an instance in which a patient did not want to be seen by Cordes because he is blind. In fact, says Braus, Cordes’ disability seemingly allows him to more easily connect with patients. “It’s almost like Tim has more credibility with some patients,” says Braus, who today works at the VA's outpatient clinic. “Tim knows what it means to recover from something or to be able to compensate or overcome a problem. People at some level seem to relate to that.” It's not easy keeping pace with Cordes — even if you can see. With sprinkles just starting to fall one dreary spring morning, Cordes and Vance — his loyal guide dog for the past nine years — walk briskly from the bus stop to his office. The ride from near his home on Madison's East Side to UW Health's Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, which is across town in University Research Park, takes about 40 minutes — not bad considering Cordes has to transfer buses on the UW- Madison campus. The jaunt from the final stop to the clinic takes about five minutes at a quick pace. Somehow, Cordes narrowly misses several potholes on the driveway leading to his office. Those who have watched Cordes for years insist he has some sort of internal radar. “He has this like, Zen, where he can walk through the living room and not step on all my son’s trains,” says his wife, Blue-leaf, a native of India and a 1994 Madison East grad who met Cordes while interviewing for the M.D.-Ph.D. program, which she also completed. “I don’t know how he does it without falling and hurting himself.” Before long, Cordes is heading up a set of stairs leading to a back entrance of the clinic. He scans his security badge to gain entry to the facility; it's just past 7 a.m. Using his sharp memory and displaying complete trust in Vance, Cordes quickly moves down a hall to his office, drops off his jacket and backpack, and heads back down a hallway to separate locked rooms that house medical records and the mail. He intuitively slides his hand over the keypad security system, and quickly taps out the code. Inside, Braille labels allow him to promptly grab the correct patient records and mail. Back in his office, he sets the papers neatly on his desk before flipping open his laptop and scanning through e-mails using screen-reading software that ticks off the messages in quick order. Like clockwork, Jeanne Harris, one of Cordes’ visual describers, arrives in the office at 7:10 a.m. to read over any faxed-in requests for prescription refills or hand-written notes, charts or surveys Cordes can't read himself. (For many printed materials, he can take a picture of a document with his smart phone, and a program will read it to him.) Ten minutes later, the paperwork is cleared, Vance is resting on the floor in the office, and Cordes is preparing for a day of numbers-crunching research on his computer. It's easy to be impressed by how efficiently Cordes operates, but he wishes others would view it as ordinary. “Just like you, I have a job to do and I figured out how to do it,” he explains. “To me, it’s gratifying how profoundly routine this all seems at times.” Even those closest to Cordes — the ones who have never doubted his potential — confess it's difficult to view this all as merely routine. Therese Cordes still has vivid memories from three decades ago when she put a 2-year-old Tim in the car and drove him to meet with the University of Iowa's highly regarded pediatric ophthalmologists. The experts there gave her little hope, rattling off a list of things her only son would never be able to do. “I cried all the way home,” says Therese, “and then decided to forget everything they told me.” Tim Cordes credits his mother for being a rock of emotional support over the years, while his father, an engineer, was pragmatically supportive — the problem-solver and the one who helped Tim get up to speed with many of the technological gizmos he relies on. It also didn't hurt that Cordes was being pushed by two older, successful sisters, both of whom were valedictorians of their high school class (Tim finished as runner-up during his senior year) before also moving on to Notre Dame. Earlier this spring, Therese Cordes was in tears again after her son got a standing ovation following his riveting speech to the Madison Civics Club. “He’s inspirational,” said his mother. What, exactly, the future holds for Cordes isn't clear. After he completes the four-year residency program in July 2011, he's considering additional training so he can help people with drug addiction problems. Another option is to land a position working with military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and severe brain injuries, work Cordes enjoys and finds rewarding. No matter what direction Cordes decides to push his career, he has no intention of becoming part of what he calls \\"today’s risk-averse society.\\" \\"I went to a playground with my son and I found out what passes for a teeter-totter these days,\\" he explained during his civics club speech. \\"It’s a U-shaped, spring-loaded contraption that assures nobody gets too high off the ground or nobody comes down too hard.\\" Cordes adds proudly: \\"I learned to swing on monkey bars — which I could not see well — over asphalt. I learned that if you fall it hurts, so you try not to fall. But it’s still worth swinging.\\" References Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from Waterloo, Iowa Category:University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health alumni Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:Blind people from the United States ","title":"Tim Cordes"},{"id":"2143865","text":"White's is a gentlemen's club in St James's, London. Status White's is the oldest gentlemen's club in London, founded in 1693, and is considered by many to be the most exclusive private club in London. Notable current members include Charles, Prince of Wales, and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose father Ian Cameron had been the club's chairman, was a member for fifteen years but resigned in 2008, over the club's declining to admit women. White's continues to maintain its standards as an establishment exclusively for gentlemen; brief exceptions were made for the visits by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991 and 2016. White's is a member of the Association of London Clubs. In January 2018, calling themselves 'Women in Whites', a group of female protesters infiltrated the club to highlight its single-sex policy, one managing to gain entry by pretending to be a man. These women were removed. History The club was originally established at 4 Chesterfield Street, off Curzon Street in Mayfair, in 1693 by an Italian immigrant named Francesco Bianco as a hot chocolate emporium under the name Mrs. White's Chocolate House. Tickets were sold to the productions at King's Theatre and Royal Drury Lane Theatre as a side-business. White's quickly made the transition from teashop to exclusive club and in the early 18th century, it was notorious as a gambling house; those who frequented it were known as \\"the gamesters of White's.\\" The club gained a reputation for both its exclusivity and the often raffish behaviour of its members. Jonathan Swift referred to White's as the \\"bane of half the English nobility.\\" In 1778 it moved to 37–38 St James's Street. From 1783 it was the unofficial headquarters of the Tory party, while the Whigs' club Brooks's was just down the road. A few apolitical and affable gentlemen managed to belong to both. The new architecture featured a bow window on the ground floor. In the later 18th century, the table directly in front of it became a seat of distinction, the throne of the most socially influential men in the club. This belonged to the arbiter elegantiarum, Beau Brummell, until he removed to the Continent in 1816, when Lord Alvanley took the place of honour. While there, he is supposed to have once bet £3,000 on which of two raindrops would reach the bottom of a pane in the bow window. Later, the spot was reserved for the use of the 1st Duke of Wellington until his death in 1852. Alvanley's was not the most eccentric bet in White's famous betting book. Some of those entries were on sports, but more often on political developments, especially during the chaotic years of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. A good many were social bets, such as whether a friend would marry this year, or whom. The club continues to maintain its tradition as a club for gentlemen members only, although one of its best known chefs from the early 1900s was Rosa Lewis, a model for the central character in the BBC television series The Duchess of Duke Street.\\"Read the Book, Darling,\\" Charles McGrath. New York Times, 22 August 2004, section 2, page 9. There were two American members in the interwar period, one of whom was a General in the U.S. Army. Postwar American members included diplomat Edward Streator. Prince Charles held his stag night at the club before his wedding to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. His eldest son, Prince William, was entered as a member of the club shortly after his birth. Clubhouse The clubhouse is located at 37–38 St James's Street in the City of Westminster and is a Grade I listed building. Originally built in 1674 and then rebuilt in 1787–88, probably by James Wyatt, it was further altered in 1811 and the frontage was remodelled by Lockyer in 1852. Constructed of Portland stone with a slate roof it possesses the Victorian version of a Palladian façade with some French motifs. The building consists of five storeys; three principal floors of facilities for members, together with a basement and a dormered attic. In the late 1970s, the exterior was painted azure with white trim. The Club bar is more compact than those of many other clubs. An amusing description of it, and of the rationale behind its size, may be found in chapter ten of the spy novel The Sixth Column (1951) by Peter Fleming (brother of Ian Fleming), in which the Club is thinly disguised as \\"Black's\\". Whilst the club does not have members' accommodation, facilities include a members' dining room, a billiards room, and several rooms (including the library and the cards room) where members may socialise, or hold private dinners. The club menu revolves around British game.

It was published in 2001 and is subtitled \\"A Wildly Distorted Account\\". Superficially a piece of travel writing, 30 Days in Sydney is perhaps more of a view into the psyche of Carey, an Australian returning home after a seventeen-year absence, his motley crew of friends, and Sydneysiders in general.  Plot overview  The book takes the form of an impressionistic, possibly somewhat fictionalised, account of Carey's brief stay, and of his attempts to gather his required material. During his time in Sydney, around the 2000 Olympic Games, he badgered his friends with a battered tape recorder, in order to get them to give their own stories and impressions of the city. Carey wishes to structure the book around the elements of earth, wind, fire and water, and his friends, sometimes reluctantly, oblige. One tells of his attempts to rescue his home from a bushfire, and another of a near death experience during the disastrous 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. Meanwhile, Carey's own narrative digresses into history and anecdote, touching on Sydney's uneasy race relations and a horrific recurring dream involving the Harbour Bridge, and culminating in a dramatic late night incident in a rooftop squat. Carey finishes the book by stating \\"A metropolis is, by definition, inexhaustible, and by the time I departed, thirty days later, Sydney was as unknowable to me as it had been on that clear April morning when I arrived.\\" Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:Australian non-fiction books Category:Australian travel books Category:Books by Peter Carey Category:Bloomsbury Publishing books ","title":"30 Days in Sydney"},{"id":"2143873","text":"Ancoats is an area of Manchester in North West England, next to the Northern Quarter, the northern part of Manchester city centre. Historically in Lancashire, Ancoats became a cradle of the Industrial Revolution and has been called \\"the world's first industrial suburb\\". For many years, from the late 18th century onwards, Ancoats was a thriving industrial district. The area suffered accelerating economic decline from the 1930s and depopulation in the years after the Second World War, particularly during the slum clearances of the 1960s. Since the 1990s Ancoats' industrial heritage has been recognised and its proximity to the city centre has led to investment and substantial regeneration. The southern part of the area is branded as New Islington, by UK property developers Urban Splash, while the north retains the Ancoats name, with redevelopment centred on the Daily Express Building. For the purpose of local government elections the area is part of the Ancoats and Beswick ward of the city of Manchester. History =Medieval= The name Ancoats is likely to have derived from the Old English ana cots, meaning \\"lonely cottages\\". The settlement is first recorded as Elnecot in 1212. In a survey of 1320, Ancoats was recorded as one of the eight hamlets within the township of Manchester in the ancient parish of Manchester within the hundred of Salford; the hamlet probably consisted of a few cottages and farmhouses centred on what is now Ancoats Lane, Butler Lane and Newton Lane. During the medieval period, Ancoats Hall was built.Miller and Wild (2007), p. 25. Land in Ancoats was bequeathed in the 14th century by Henry de Ancotes. The village covered the area of land that roughly lies between the River Medlock and the River Irk. =Industrial Revolution= Cotton McConnel's Mills, 1820 McConnel's Mills, 1913Survey work for the Rochdale Canal was carried out by James Brindley in 1765. The knowledge that its construction would make the transport of raw materials and finished goods more convenient gave industrialists the confidence to build their cotton mills. The first mills were built in Ancoats as early as 1790. In 1792 commissioners were established for the improvement of the township of Manchester, which included Ancoats. Towards the end of the 18th century steam power was first used to power the cotton mills. Some of the earliest mills of this period were Murray's Mills, which were established next to the Rochdale Canal on Union Street (now Redhill Street) off Great Ancoats Street, by Adam and George Murray in 1798. Later, they became known as Ancoats Mills when they were operated by McConnel & Company Ltd. The streets of Ancoats were also laid out during the latter part of the 18th century, with little development taking place other than small houses and shops along Great Ancoats Street and Oldham Road (A62 road). From the opening of the Rochdale Canal in 1804 the development of mills continued on a much larger scale. Mills in Ancoats included Victoria Mills, Wellington Mill, Brunswick Mill, India Mills, Dolton Mills, Lonsdale Mills, Phoenix Mill, Lloydsfield Mill, Sedgewick Mill, Decker Mill (owned by the Murray brothers), New Mill, Beehive Mill, Little Mill, Paragon Mill, Royal Mill and Pin Mill. Ancoats grew rapidly to become an important industrial centre and as a result it also became a densely populated area. By 1815 Ancoats was the most populous district in Manchester. Streets of back-to-back houses and court dwellings were rapidly built. For the poorest members of the community, houses were split and cellars let separately. Public health was a concern; a survey motivated by the fear of a cholera outbreak showed that over half of homes in Ancoats had no private plumbing, and over half of streets were not cleaned. By the middle of the 19th century Ancoats was densely developed. In 1851 Ancoats' total population was 53,737, larger than towns such as Bury and Blackburn. However, despite this large population, Ancoats lacked public buildings and spaces. There were no parks and the only public buildings were a few churches and a dispensary. As late as 1821 there had been no churches. Foundries Cotton was not the only industry in the locality, as foundries and engineering factories were required to produce the machinery needed by the mills. The largest of these were those operated by the brothers John Muir Hetherington and Thomas Ridley Hetherington, which were established in 1830. Eventually the company became known as John Hetherington and Sons Ltd and the principal factory was at Vulcan Works on Pollard Street. The company was also the proprietor of Curtis, Sons & Company, which was established in 1804 at the Phoenix Works, which were on both sides of Chapel Street (now Chapeltown Street). On one side of the street there was a brass and iron works and on the other side there was a machinery factory. Hetherington's produced a huge range of machinery for the textile industry that included machinery for opening, preparing, spinning and doubling cotton, cotton waste, wool and worsted. Their speciality was a machine called a Combined Opener and Scutcher that was very effective in the cleaning of most types of cotton without damaging the staple or losing serviceable fibre. Glass works Possibly the least known, but vitally important, industry in Ancoats was the manufacture of flint glass. More than 25 glassworks have been identified in Manchester, all built during the 19th century, and many of these were in Ancoats. Thomas Percival and William Yates established one of these on Union Street (now Redhill Street) in 1844. The works was equipped with two furnaces (later three), an annealing house, workshops, a warehouse and offices. In 1852, Thomas Vickers joined the company and William Yates left in 1862. After this, the company became known as Percival Vickers British and Foreign Flint Glass Works. It made a large range of glassware that included tumblers, wine glasses, decanters, vases, celery vases, salts and cake stands. One of the buildings in Ancoats, the Flint Glass Works, still exists today and has been converted into serviced offices. Other industries At the top of Stony Brow (later Junction Street and now Jutland Street) there was the multi-storey drysalters factory of Thomas Hassall. It was said that this was the only drysalters in England and it supplied rock salt, moss litter and all kinds of other things. There were also chemical works (especially alum), floor-cloth works and finishing and calendering works that rolled cloth to smooth or glaze it. =Later Victorian period= Immigration During the 19th century, due to political and economic circumstances, many Italians left Italy for a more secure life. Most of the Italians who arrived in Ancoats were from Liguria, in northwest Italy, and Frosinone and Gaeta, southeast of Rome. Over the next hundred years they created what became known as Ancoats Little Italy. Large numbers of Irish also settled in Ancoats. According to the 1851 census almost half of the men living in Ancoats had been born in Ireland.Miller and Wild (2007), p. 25 - 32 Religion and poor relief The Methodists were very active in Ancoats at the end of the 19th century – they ran both a men's workhouse and women's night shelter (with coffee tavern). There were dozens of pubs, however, of which only five buildings remain and only two of these are still open. The Salvation Army had a presence in Ancoats, with the Star Hall and Crossley Hospital in Pollard Street. Crossley Court, flats belonging to the Salvation Army Housing Association, now stands on the site. Ancoats Hospital was located on Old Mill Street, adjacent to the Ashton Canal. This has been closed to patients for some time, and is currently under residential development. Thomas Horsfall opened the Manchester Art Museum, a free art gallery, in Ancoats in 1886. His aim was to create a morally elevating alternative to pubs.Wilson, Shelagh, \\"The Highest Art for the lowest People: The Whitechapel and Other Philanthropic Art Galleries, 1877-1901\\", Governing Cultures, Ashgate, 2000, pp. 172-86. Given the historically high levels of Irish and Italian immigration, a large proportion of Ancoats' population has been Roman Catholic. Ancoats had a colony of Italians from 1835 and many of them became successful in business; e.g. the Ronchetti family were opticians, instrument makers and also waterproof manufacturers; J. L. Casartelli was an optician, instrument maker and manufacturing chemist.Frangopulo, N. J., ed. (1962) Rich Inheritance. Manchester: Education Committee; p. 117 =Early 20th century= Aircraft were manufactured in Ancoats and this factory was at Brownsfield Mill, which was on the corner of Great Ancoats Street and Binns Place at the point where the Rochdale Canal passes below Great Ancoats Street. Here, A.V. Roe (Avro) established his factory in 1910. Men from Ancoats serving in the Army in France during the First World War were aware that aeroplanes they saw in action above them had been made in Ancoats. In 1939, the Daily Express newspaper company opened new premises, which were built in the \\"functional\\" style, using new curtain-wall technology identical to that on the company's Daily Express Building in Fleet Street, London and in Glasgow. =Post-war decline= The substantial economic activity generated by such a concentration of mills was halted by the slump in the cotton industry in the 1930s. Thereafter, the prosperity of the mills declined steadily, and the only new industry to establish itself in Ancoats was newspaper printing. Ancoats, like neighbouring Miles Platting and Collyhurst, became very run down and notorious for deprivation and crime. Cotton spinning ceased in Manchester and other textile-related uses were found for the mills: clothes manufacture, machinery repairs and warehouses for imported goods' rag trade. The 1960s witnessed further decline as, during the mass clearance of the area's terraced homes, the population was re-housed in the north and east of the city. The mills, attracting decreasing rents, fell into disrepair. Despite the clearance of Victorian terraces during the early 1960s and the relocation of most households to overspill estates like Hattersley and Gamesley, many new houses and flats were built in Ancoats by the local council. Inevitably, the local area's population was lower by 1970 than it had been a decade earlier, as the new housing developments were more spaced out, and some former residential areas had been redeveloped for commercial and industrial use. Newspaper printing, one of Ancoats' 20th century industries, fell victim to changes in technology, with the Daily Express ceasing to be published from its famous black glass building in 1989. The closure of Express Printers was also the start of Ancoats' renewal, as the impact of low investment and increasing unemployment became recognised.Miller and Wild (2007), p. 3 - 5 =Regeneration= In June 1989, Manchester City Council designated land bounded by Great Ancoats Street, Oldham Road, Kemp Street, Wadeford Close, Jersey Street and the Rochdale Canal into a conservation area where a number of buildings were listed. While it protected a number of historically significant buildings, it made regeneration more difficult. In 1990, the Eastside Regeneration was formed, the first organisation created to regenerate the area. The Eastside Regeneration in turn spawned the formation of the Ancoats Build Preservation Trust in 1995 and the Ancoats Urban Village Company in 1996. Unfortunately, Manchester's bids for the 1996 and 2000 Olympics caused speculative buying of property in Ancoats in the early 1990s. When the bids failed the buildings were abandoned and decay accelerated. By 1998 it was estimated that 80% of business floor space in Ancoats was vacant. In 2000, the government accepted the £250m New Islington Project to redevelop a section of land between the Rochdale and Ashton Canals. To assist regeneration by preventing speculative purchase of land the North West Development Agency made a compulsory purchase order of land in the area. A target population of 15,000 by 2010 was set for the Ancoats area.

When her husband, a devout Catholic, discovered them in each other's arms, he took Hendra on a trip to Quarr Abbey, a monastery on the Isle of Wight off the coast of England. Hendra, expecting to be disciplined, was surprised when a \\"cartoonish\\" monk, Father Joseph Warrilow, instead treated him kindly. Hendra fell in love with Quarr and decided to become a monk. When Hendra reached the age of eighteen and could legally begin his time at Quarr, Father Joe found out that Hendra had received a scholarship to Cambridge University, and he urged Hendra to first attend college and obtain a degree before he could be admitted to the monastery. While at Cambridge, Hendra attended a theatrical revue called Beyond the Fringe. The brilliant performance by Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller had such an impact on him that his life set off on a totally different course.

If the technique is performed at high speed on a single string or course voicing the same note, it may be referred to as \\"tremolo picking\\" or \\"double picking\\". Good alternate picking involves a continuous down-up or up-down motion of the picking hand, even when not picking a note (except when the gap lasts longer than one full up-down motion). In this manner, an up-beat (such as an even-numbered eighth note or, at faster tempos, sixteenth note) will always be played with an upward picking stroke, while the down-beats are always played with downward picking strokes. This allows for fluid incorporation of legato-based notes such as hammer-ons and/or pull-offs in the middle of picked phrases. The technique has many advantages and some disadvantages, largely depending on the licks the guitarist is attempting to play. For example, during fast passages, alternate picking is necessary in keeping the picking arm from tiring out. At very high tempos, alternate picking is essentially required, since techniques like downpicking are made not feasible. Most scalar runs are most easily played using alternate picking. Similarly, the complex, syncopated rhythm guitar patterns found in death metal require a good alternate picking technique to play fast and accurately. On the other hand, large arpeggios (especially those spanning more than one octave) are very difficult to play using pure alternate picking and almost impossible to play at great speeds, which is why many guitarists choose to employ sweep picking to play these arpeggios (e.g. Glenn Tipton, K. K. Downing, Frank Gambale & Mario Parga). Similarly, some kinds of licks are easier when played using such specialized techniques as legato, economy picking (a hybrid of alternate and sweep picking) or tapping. Despite some of the well-known disadvantages of the technique, some guitarists (such as Al Di Meola, Steve Morse) emphasize the near-exclusive use of alternate picking, even in situations where another technique would be easier, claiming that pure alternate picking leads to a more consistent sound and allows for greater control of tone. Alternate picking can be heard in almost all styles of picked guitar music, from jazz and bluegrass, to heavy metal. Victor Wooten uses his thumb for alternate picking, as displayed on his DVD \\"Super Bass Solo Technique\\".

Quadratic variation is just one kind of variation of a process.  Definition  Suppose that Xt is a real-valued stochastic process defined on a probability space (\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},\\\\mathbb{P}) and with time index t ranging over the non- negative real numbers. Its quadratic variation is the process, written as [X]t, defined as :[X]_t=\\\\lim_{\\\\Vert P\\\\Vert\\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\sum_{k=1}^n(X_{t_k}-X_{t_{k-1}})^2 where P ranges over partitions of the interval [0,t] and the norm of the partition P is the mesh. This limit, if it exists, is defined using convergence in probability. Note that a process may be of finite quadratic variation in the sense of the definition given here and its paths be nonetheless almost surely of infinite 1-variation for every t>0 in the classical sense of taking the supremum of the sum over all partitions; this is in particular the case for Brownian Motion. More generally, the covariation (or cross-variance) of two processes X and Y is : [X,Y]_t = \\\\lim_{\\\\Vert P\\\\Vert \\\\to 0}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\\\left(X_{t_k}-X_{t_{k-1}}\\\\right)\\\\left(Y_{t_k}-Y_{t_{k-1}}\\\\right). The covariation may be written in terms of the quadratic variation by the polarization identity: :[X,Y]_t=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}([X+Y]_t-[X]_t-[Y]_t).  Finite variation processes  A process X is said to have finite variation if it has bounded variation over every finite time interval (with probability 1). Such processes are very common including, in particular, all continuously differentiable functions. The quadratic variation exists for all continuous finite variation processes, and is zero. This statement can be generalized to non-continuous processes. Any càdlàg finite variation process X has quadratic variation equal to the sum of the squares of the jumps of X. To state this more precisely, the left limit of Xt with respect to t is denoted by Xt-, and the jump of X at time t can be written as ΔXt = Xt - Xt-. Then, the quadratic variation is given by :[X]_t=\\\\sum_{0 The proof that continuous finite variation processes have zero quadratic variation follows from the following inequality. Here, P is a partition of the interval [0,t], and Vt(X) is the variation of X over [0,t]. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n(X_{t_k}-X_{t_{k-1}})^2&\\\\le\\\\max_{k\\\\le n}X_{t_k}-X_{t_{k-1}}\\\\sum_{k=1}^nX_{t_k}-X_{t_{k-1}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\le\\\\max_{u-v\\\\le\\\\Vert P\\\\Vert}X_u-X_vV_t(X). \\\\end{align} By the continuity of X, this vanishes in the limit as \\\\Vert P\\\\Vert goes to zero.  Itô processes  The quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion B exists, and is given by [B]t = t, however the limit in the definition is meant in the L2 sense and not pathwise. This generalizes to Itô processes that, by definition, can be expressed in terms of Itô integrals : \\\\begin{align} X_t &= X_0 + \\\\int_0^t\\\\sigma_s\\\\,dB_s + \\\\int_0^t\\\\mu_s\\\\,d[B]_s \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= X_0 + \\\\int_0^t\\\\sigma_s\\\\,dB_s + \\\\int_0^t\\\\mu_s\\\\,ds,\\\\end{align} where B is a Brownian motion. Any such process has quadratic variation given by :[X]_t=\\\\int_0^t\\\\sigma_s^2\\\\,ds.  Semimartingales  Quadratic variations and covariations of all semimartingales can be shown to exist. They form an important part of the theory of stochastic calculus, appearing in Itô's lemma, which is the generalization of the chain rule to the Itô integral. The quadratic covariation also appears in the integration by parts formula :X_tY_t=X_0Y_0+\\\\int_0^tX_{s-}\\\\,dY_s + \\\\int_0^tY_{s-}\\\\,dX_s+[X,Y]_t, which can be used to compute [X,Y]. Alternatively this can be written as a Stochastic Differential Equation: :\\\\,d(X_tY_t)=X_{t-}\\\\,dY_t + Y_{t-}\\\\,dX_t+\\\\,dX_t \\\\,dY_t, where \\\\,dX_t \\\\,dY_t=\\\\,d[X,Y]_t.  Martingales  All càdlàg martingales, and local martingales have well defined quadratic variation, which follows from the fact that such processes are examples of semimartingales. It can be shown that the quadratic variation [M] of a general locally square integrable martingale M is the unique right-continuous and increasing process starting at zero, with jumps Δ[M] = ΔM2, and such that M2 − [M] is a local martingale. A proof of existence of [M] (without using stochastic calculus) is given in Karandikar–Rao (2014). A useful result for square integrable martingales is the Itô isometry, which can be used to calculate the variance of Itô integrals, :\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\int_0^t H\\\\,dM\\\\right)^2\\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left(\\\\int_0^tH^2\\\\,d[M]\\\\right). This result holds whenever M is a càdlàg square integrable martingale and H is a bounded predictable process, and is often used in the construction of the Itô integral. Another important result is the Burkholder–Davis–Gundy inequality. This gives bounds for the maximum of a martingale in terms of the quadratic variation. For a local martingale M starting at zero, with maximum denoted by Mt* ≡ sups≤ tMs, and any real number p ≥ 1, the inequality is :c_p\\\\operatorname{E}([M]_t^{p/2})\\\\le \\\\operatorname{E}((M^*_t)^p)\\\\le C_p\\\\operatorname{E}([M]_t^{p/2}). Here, cp < Cp are constants depending on the choice of p, but not depending on the martingale M or time t used. If M is a continuous local martingale, then the Burkholder–Davis–Gundy inequality holds for any p > 0\\\\. An alternative process, the predictable quadratic variation is sometimes used for locally square integrable martingales. This is written as t, and is defined to be the unique right-continuous and increasing predictable process starting at zero such that M2 − is a local martingale. Its existence follows from the Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem and, for continuous local martingales, it is the same as the quadratic variation.

Before turning professional he represented Great Britain at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Colin had a trainer by the name of Gareth Bevan, also helped out by his son John Bevan. Boxing career In 1976 Jones was the youngest British boxer to qualify for the Olympic Games until Amir Khan appeared at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He was one of the hardest punching welterweights of his generation and his ability to knock fighters out with a single shot (with either hand) allowed him the luxury of being a notoriously slow starter. A second round stoppage of Danish fighter Hans Henrik Palm (in Copenhagen) won him the European crown and confirmed his arrival as a world class fighter. He lost three times, one by disqualification (Curtis Ramsey), one by split decision (Milton McCrory) and once when he was stopped in four rounds (cuts) by Donald Curry. The latter two losses came in challenges for the world title after he had drawn with McCrory in his first attempt to claim it. Despite these setbacks at world level (both fights against McCrory were in America and could have gone either way), he was dominant at domestic level with his two \\"come from behind\\" knockout victories against the gifted Kirkland Laing particular highlights. A modest and well- respected fighter, Jones, still regarded as boxing royalty in his native Wales, won the BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year in 1983. Jones was assistant to National Coach Tony Williams for the Welsh Boxing team at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Jones was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to boxing in Wales.

Early life Brian Mark Blackwell was born in 1986 in West Lancashire to Jacqueline Blackwell, a former antiques dealer, and Sydney Blackwell, a retired accountant known as \\"Big Brian\\". Until July 2004, Blackwell lived at home with his parents in Melling, Merseyside, an affluent village in the northern suburbs of Liverpool, England. It is believed that his parents were overindulgent, as well as excessively overprotective and controlling of even minor aspects of Blackwell's life throughout his childhood. He had been an under-18 tennis champion at the local club. Nicknamed \\"Little Brian\\" by his parents and \\"Brains\\" by his friends, he was described as an \\"exemplary student\\" with a scholarship to Liverpool College and was planning to begin studying medicine at the University of Nottingham in the autumn of 2004. He regularly told innocuous lies, such as embellishing his academic achievements, but his lying escalated in the two months leading up to killing his parents in July 2004. He applied for 13 credit cards in his father's name and attempted to obtain a cash advance from the bank by falsely claiming to be a professional tennis player who needed the money to play in the French Open later that summer. He wrote on his application form that he'd be able to repay the loan with his fabricated salary of £45,000 a year. His girlfriend at the time believed he was a professional tennis player with a sponsorship from Nike and that he had a £60,000 Mercedes and a £450,000 flat in the same complex where footballer Steven Gerrard lived. With the savings bond that his parents had intended for university, he bought his girlfriend expensive gifts, and \\"hired\\" her as his manager, writing her a cheque for £39,000 that bounced. When his mother found out about the lies he told to the bank and the large withdrawals he had made, she contacted the bank manager. Killings On 25 July 2004, Blackwell killed his parents in their home by bludgeoning them with a claw hammer and stabbing them repeatedly with a carving knife. He told the Liverpool Crown Court at his 2005 trial that he became enraged when his parents expressed concern about his extravagant spending and tried to stop him from travelling to the US with his then-girlfriend. The next day, Blackwell and his girlfriend, who was unaware of the violent crime Blackwell had just committed, went on a lavish holiday to the United States as originally planned. Upon returning to Liverpool in mid-August, Blackwell stayed at his girlfriend's house for the next couple of weeks under the pretence that he was locked out of his parents' house while they were on holiday in Spain. Investigation and prosecution On 5 September 2004, six weeks after they were killed, police discovered the decomposing bodies of Blackwell's parents after a neighbour called to report a strong, unusual odour coming from the property. The decomposition of the bodies from the attacks was so advanced that investigators initially thought they had died from gun shot wounds. Blackwell was arrested the following day and charged with two counts of murder. He denied the charges during initial interviews and hearings and was remanded into custody without bail until trial. During an interview, Blackwell claimed he knew nothing of his parents' deaths and was on holiday when they were killed. After two days of questioning, Blackwell's story began to change. He confessed to the killings and claimed that he had acted in self-defence. According to Blackwell, he was holding a claw hammer for hanging a picture on the wall when his father stood up to hit him. Investigators had previously learned that Blackwell's father had been struck on the back of the head while sitting down, which conflicted with Blackwell's claim of self-defence. Afterwards, according to Blackwell, his mother came in, and he attacked her. The double-murder charge was dropped after he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after experts diagnosed him with narcissistic personality disorder. Blackwell was sentenced to life imprisonment on 29 June 2005. According to The Guardian, Blackwell could theoretically be eligible for parole after serving just over five and half years if a psychiatrist decided he was \\"fit for release\\", but the judge stated that \\"present evidence suggests that that conclusion is unlikely ever to be reached.\\".

The condition, commonly known as a runny nose, occurs relatively frequently. Rhinorrhea is a common symptom of allergies (hay fever) or certain viral infections, such as the common cold. It can be a side effect of crying, exposure to cold temperatures, cocaine abuse, or withdrawal, such as from opioids like methadone. Treatment for rhinorrhea is not usually necessary, but there are a number of medical treatments and preventive techniques available. The term was coined in 1866 and is a combination of the Greek terms rhino- (\\"of the nose\\") and -rhoia (\\"discharge\\" or \\"flow\\"). Signs and symptoms Rhinorrhea is characterized by an excess amount of mucus produced by the mucous membranes that line the nasal cavities. The membranes create mucus faster than it can be processed, causing a backup of mucus in the nasal cavities. As the cavity fills up, it blocks off the air passageway, causing difficulty breathing through the nose. Air caught in nasal cavities, namely the sinus cavities, cannot be released and the resulting pressure may cause a headache or facial pain. If the sinus passage remains blocked, there is a chance that sinusitis may result. If the mucus backs up through the Eustachian tube, it may result in ear pain or an ear infection. Excess mucus accumulating in the throat or back of the nose may cause a post-nasal drip, resulting in a sore throat or coughing. Additional symptoms include sneezing, nosebleeds, and nasal discharge. Causes =Cold temperature= Rhinorrhea is especially common during winter months and certain low temperature seasons. Cold-induced rhinorrhea occurs due to a combination of thermodynamics and the body's natural reactions to cold weather stimuli. One of the purposes of nasal mucus is to warm inhaled air to body temperature as it enters the body. In order for this to happen, the nasal cavities must be constantly coated with liquid mucus. During cold, dry seasons, the mucus lining nasal passages tends to dry out, meaning that mucous membranes must work harder, producing more mucus to keep the cavity lined. As a result, the nasal cavity can fill up with mucus. At the same time, when air is exhaled, water vapor in breath condenses as the warm air meets the colder outside temperature near the nostrils. This causes an excess amount of water to build up inside nasal cavities. In these cases, the excess fluid usually spills out externally through the nostrils. =Infection= Rhinorrhea can be a symptom of other diseases, such as the common cold or influenza. During these infections, the nasal mucous membranes produce excess mucus, filling the nasal cavities. This is to prevent infection from spreading to the lungs and respiratory tract, where it could cause far worse damage. It has also been suggested that rhinorrhea is a result of viral evolution, and may be a response that is not useful to the host, but which has evolved by the virus to maximise its own infectivity. Rhinorrhea caused by these infections usually occur on circadian rhythms. Over the course of a viral infection, sinusitis (the inflammation of the nasal tissue) may occur, causing the mucous membranes to release more mucus. Acute sinusitis consists of the nasal passages swelling during a viral infection. Chronic sinusitis occurs when one or more nasal polyps appear. This can be caused by a deviated septum as well as a viral infection. =Allergies= Pollen grains from a variety of common plants can cause an allergic reaction. Rhinorrhea can also occur when individuals with allergies to certain substances, such as pollen, dust, latex, soy, shellfish, or animal dander, are exposed to these allergens. In people with sensitized immune systems, the inhalation of one of these substances triggers the production of the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE), which binds to mast cells and basophils. IgE bound to mast cells are stimulated by pollen and dust, causing the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. In turn, this causes, among other things, inflammation and swelling of the tissue of the nasal cavities as well as increased mucus production. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as chlorine and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can make the condition considerably worse. =Crying= Rhinorrhea is also associated with shedding tears (lacrimation), whether from emotional events or from eye irritation. When excess tears are produced, the liquid drains through the inner corner of the eyelids, through the nasolacrimal duct, and into the nasal cavities. As more tears are shed, more liquid flows into the nasal cavities, both stimulating mucus production and hydrating any dry mucus already present in the nasal cavity. The buildup of fluid is usually resolved via mucus expulsion through the nostrils. =Head trauma= If caused by a head injury, rhinorrhea can be a much more serious condition. A basilar skull fracture can result in a rupture of the barrier between the sinonasal cavity and the anterior cranial fossae or the middle cranial fossae. This rupture can cause the nasal cavity to fill with cerebrospinal fluid. This condition, known as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea or CSF rhinorrhea, can lead to a number of serious complications and possibly death if not addressed properly. =Other causes= Rhinorrhea can occur as a symptom of opioid withdrawal accompanied by lacrimation. When it occurs after exercise, it is a symptom of exercise-induced rhinitis. Other causes include cystic fibrosis, whooping cough, nasal tumors, hormonal changes, and cluster headaches. Due to changes in clinical practice, Rhinorrhea is now reported as a frequent side effect of oxygen-intubation during colonoscopy procedures [A simple, innovative way to reduce rhinitis symptoms after sedation during endoscopy\\" by Nai-Liang Li, et al., Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology, 2011, Feb; volume 25(2): pages 68–72.]. Rhinorrhea can also be the side effect of several genetic disorders, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment In most cases, treatment for rhinorrhea is not necessary since it will clear up on its own—especially if it is the symptom of an infection. For general cases nose-blowing can get rid of the mucus buildup. Though blowing may be a quick-fix solution, it would likely proliferate mucosal production in the sinuses, leading to frequent and higher mucus buildups in the nose. Alternatively, saline nasal sprays and vasoconstrictor nasal sprays may also be used, but may become counterproductive after several days of use, causing rhinitis medicamentosa. In recurring cases, such as those due to allergies, there are medicinal treatments available. For cases caused by histamine buildup, several types of antihistamines can be obtained relatively cheaply from drugstores. People who prefer to keep clear nasal passages, such as singers, who need a clear nasal passage to perform, may use a technique called nasal irrigation to prevent rhinorrhea. Nasal irrigation involves rinsing the nasal cavity regularly with salty water or commercial saline solutions.

It extends from the Valley Forge exit of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in King of Prussia, paralleling its namesake Schuylkill River for most of the route, to the Walt Whitman Bridge in South Philadelphia. It serves as the primary corridor into Philadelphia from points west. Maintenance and planning are administered through Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) District 6. Constructed over a period of ten years from 1949 to 1959, a large portion of the expressway predates the 1956 introduction of Interstate Highway System; many of these portions were not built to contemporary standards. The rugged terrain, limited riverfront space covered by the route and narrow spans of bridges passing over the highway have largely stymied later attempts to upgrade or widen the highway. With the road being highly over capacity, it has become notorious for its chronic congestion. An average of 163,000 vehicles use the road daily in Philadelphia County, and an average of 109,000 use the highway in Montgomery County, making it the busiest road in commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its narrow lane and left shoulder configuration, left lane entrances and exits (nicknamed \\"merge or die\\"), common construction activity and generally congested conditions have led to many accidents, critical injuries and fatalities, leading to the highway's humorous nickname of the \\"Surekill Expressway\\" or in further embellishment, the \\"Surekill Distressway\\" or the “Surekill Crawlway\\".Pennsylvania Highways: Interstate 76 Route description =Montgomery County= The Schuylkill Expressway westbound at the US 202 exit in King of Prussia The Schuylkill Expressway begins at the Valley Forge Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the community of King of Prussia in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County. The I-76 designation continues west on the Pennsylvania Turnpike from this point, while the Pennsylvania Turnpike from this point east is designated I-276. The road heads southeast from the trumpet interchange as a nine-lane freeway carrying four westbound lanes and five eastbound lanes that is designated as part of I-76, passing through the Valley Forge Interchange toll plaza. Past the toll plaza, the Schuylkill Expressway narrows to four lanes, with two lanes in each direction, and comes to an eastbound exit and entrance with Gulph Road, providing access to Valley Forge National Historical Park and the King of Prussia Town Center, and a westbound exit and entrance with Mall Boulevard, providing access to the King of Prussia mall to the northeast of the road. The freeway passes businesses and comes to an interchange with US 202, the eastern terminus of US 422, and Swedesford Road that serves King of Prussia. A westbound collector/distributor road carrying two lanes provides access to the US 202/US 422/Swedesford Road and Mall Boulevard interchanges. I-76 passes under the Chester Valley Trail and Norfolk Southern's Dale Secondary and continues east-southeast as a six-lane road between residential areas to the southwest and commercial areas to the northeast, eventually narrowing to four lanes. The freeway heads east and comes to a westbound exit and entrance with Gulph Road and Henderson Road. The Schuylkill Expressway curves southeast near wooded areas of homes before coming to an interchange with PA 320 in the community of Gulph Mills. This interchange has an eastbound exit and entrance and a westbound exit. Within this interchange, the highway passes over SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line and crosses Gulph Creek. Past the PA 320 interchange, I-76 continues east-southeast through woodland near residential development, heading into Lower Merion Township. The freeway enters the borough of West Conshohocken and comes to an interchange with I-476 that also has ramps providing access to PA 23 and serving the boroughs of West Conshohocken and Conshohocken. The Schuylkill Expressway near Conshohocken, close to the interchange with I-476 Past the I-476 interchange, the Schuylkill Expressway heads east and comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance providing access to PA 23 and Conshohocken, passing near residential and commercial development. The freeway passes over PA 23 and leaves West Conshohocken for Lower Merion Township, where it heads through wooded areas and runs on top of a cliff, with Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and the Schuylkill River parallel to the north below the cliff and another cliff rising above the highway to the south. East of Conshohocken at about mile marker 331, it curves sharply southeast in a 90-degree turn locally known as the \\"Conshohocken Curve\\" or \\"Conshy Curve\\", which has a history of traffic congestion and dangerous conditions. I-76 continues southeast through wooded areas, with the railroad tracks and the river parallel to the northeast. Farther southeast, the Schuylkill Expressway crosses Mill Creek and comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with Hollow Road that provides access to the community of Gladwyne. The freeway passes over the Flat Rock Tunnel carrying Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and continues to the southeast with the Schuylkill River to the northeast and the railroad tracks to the southwest. I-76 comes to a diamond interchange with Belmont Avenue and Green Lane, with Belmont Avenue heading south through the community of Bala Cynwyd in Lower Merion Township, and Green Lane crossing the river into the Philadelphia neighborhood of Manayunk. Following this interchange, the freeway passes under the Manayunk Bridge that carries an extension of the Cynwyd Heritage Trail across the Schuylkill River. The Schuykill Expressway passes over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and runs southeast between the West Laurel Hill Cemetery to the southwest and an industrial area to the northeast that is sandwiched between the railroad tracks and the river. I-76 comes to an interchange with City Avenue on the border of Lower Merion Township and the city of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County; City Avenue heads southwest as US 1 and northeast across the Schuylkill River on the City Avenue Bridges to an interchange with Ridge Avenue, Lincoln Drive, and Kelly Drive. =Philadelphia County= Past the City Avenue interchange, I-76 enters the city of Philadelphia and becomes concurrent with US 1, with the Schuylkill Expressway widening to eight lanes and running between a yard on Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and the river to the north and wooded areas of Fairmount Park to the south. US 1 splits from I-76 by heading northeast on the Roosevelt Expressway, while I-76 continues south on the Schuylkill Expressway, heading through Fairmount Park and running parallel to CSX's Trenton Subdivision, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River to the east. The freeway curves to the southwest, with CSX's Trenton Subdivision heading east away from the road and CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision beginning to run parallel. I-76 comes to a diamond interchange with Montgomery Drive that provides access to Fairmount Park and serves the Mann Center for the Performing Arts. Following this, the Schuylkill Expressway narrows to six lanes and turns to the southeast, running through more of the park with the railroad tracks, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River parallel to the northeast. The freeway passes under CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision and comes to an interchange with US 13 and US 30 at Girard Avenue. Within this interchange, the highway passes under the Pennsylvania Railroad, Connecting Railway Bridge that carries Amtrak's Northeast Corridor across the Schuylkill River before heading under the Girard Avenue Bridge that carries US 13 (Girard Avenue) across the river. US 30 becomes concurrent with I-76 on the Schuylkill Expressway at this point and the road heads south, with the Philadelphia Zoo to the west and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River still parallel to the east. The freeway turns southeast and runs between Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the southwest and the river drive, trail, and river to the northeast, with Boathouse Row on the opposite bank of the river. The Schuylkill Expressway comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with Spring Garden Street, which heads east across the Schuylkill River towards the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The freeway continues south, heading east of a large Amtrak railroad yard, and comes to an interchange with the western terminus of I-676, which heads east along with US 30 on the Vine Street Expressway into Center City. Westbound Schuylkill Expressway at I-676/US 30 (Vine Street Expressway) in Center City Philadelphia Following this, I-76 narrows to four lanes and heads south between the Amtrak yard to the west and the Schuylkill River to the east. The road comes to an interchange with Market Street (PA 3) and 30th Street that provides access to the 30th Street Station that serves Amtrak, SEPTA Regional Rail, and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line along with the Cira Centre and University City. At this point, the Schuylkill Expressway dips below street level and runs in a tunnel sandwiched between 30th Street Station and the city's former main Post Office facility to the west and the river to the east, with Schuylkill Avenue running at street level above the tunnel and intersecting John F. Kennedy Boulevard (PA 3 west), Market Street (PA 3 east), Chestnut Street, and Walnut Street. Past the interchange, the freeway returns to ground level and runs southwest between Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the northwest and the Schuylkill River to the southeast, coming to an interchange with South Street that has left entrances and exits. I-76 continues southwest alongside the river, with athletic fields belonging to the University of Pennsylvania to the northwest of the road. The Schuylkill Expressway passes under the Schuylkill Arsenal Railroad Bridge that carries CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision across the river before coming to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance providing access to University Avenue. Following this, the freeway passes over the Schuylkill River on the Schuylkill Expressway Bridge and heads into South Philadelphia. The highway passes over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision and heads south-southwest near urban residential and commercial areas and reaches a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with 34th Street just south of Wharton Street that provides access to Grays Ferry Avenue. I-76 widens to six lanes and continues south near urban development, curving southeast and running between the Philadelphia Gas Works to the southwest and urban neighborhoods to the northeast and reaching an eastbound interchange for 28th Street and a westbound interchange with Vare Avenue and Mifflin Street. The Schuylkill Expressway comes to an interchange with Passyunk Avenue and Oregon Avenue that also has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance to 26th Street that provides access to PA 291 and the Philadelphia International Airport. At this point, I-76 narrows to four lanes and turns south, with a CSX railroad branch parallel to the west and CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision parallel to the east. This marks the point heading eastbound where the Delaware River Port Authority maintains the road. The freeway makes a sharp turn to the east and passes under the Harrisburg Subdivision, heading near commercial areas and coming to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with the eastern terminus of PA 291 at Penrose Avenue, providing access to the Philadelphia International Airport. The Schuylkill Expressway continues east near urban residential neighborhoods and reaches an interchange with PA 611 (Broad Street). From here, I-76 widens to six lanes and passes north of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, coming to an interchange with 7th Street and Packer Avenue that has an eastbound exit and entrance and a westbound exit. A short distance later, the freeway comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance providing access to I-95 and Front Street. Immediately after, the road has a westbound toll plaza for the Walt Whitman Bridge. The freeway heads onto the seven-lane Walt Whitman Bridge, which carries it over Front Street, I-95, Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Swanson Street Industrial Track, industrial areas in the Port of Philadelphia, Christopher Columbus Boulevard, the Philadelphia Belt Line Railroad, and finally the Delaware River. At this point, the Schuylkill Expressway ends and I-76 continues into New Jersey. History Eastbound Schuylkill Expressway approaching Center City Philadelphia Plans for a limited-access highway along the west bank of the Schuylkill River originated in 1932, as part of a proposed cars-only parkway system for the Philadelphia area similar to the contemporary system being built in New York City. The \\"Valley Forge Parkway\\" was to have run from Fairmount Park to Valley Forge State Park, with plans for a later extension to Reading via Pottstown. However, planning for the proposed parkway system stalled and the plan was eventually abandoned. Planning for today's expressway began in 1947, when the city of Philadelphia approved plans to develop a highway connecting the city with the terminus of the planned Philadelphia Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Valley Forge. The highway was designed by engineers Michael Rapuano, who had previously aided in the design of the Garden State Parkway, and Bill Allen of Gannett Fleming. The new expressway largely followed the earlier planned parkway route from Valley Forge to Fairmount Park, while also extending into southern Philadelphia and across the Delaware River into New Jersey. Two alternatives were proposed south of University City: one routing would continue along the west bank of the river into Southwest Philadelphia to its confluence near Philadelphia International Airport, where it would tunnel underneath the Delaware to Paulsboro, New Jersey; the other would cross the Schuylkill south of University City and bisect South Philadelphia, crossing the Delaware into Gloucester City, New Jersey. Planned expansions of the airport in the path of the former proposal led to adoption of the routing through South Philadelphia. Construction of the road began in 1949. The road was completed in stages, with a short segment near King of Prussia opening in 1951 along with the Turnpike's Philadelphia Extension, with the section from King of Prussia to Conshohocken opening a year later. The section between Conshohocken and City Avenue opened in 1954. The Walt Whitman Bridge opened in 1957. The expressway was completed through Fairmount Park in 1959, and in 1960 the entire expressway was complete with the opening of the segment through University City. Approaching the South Street exit The Schuylkill Expressway was initially designated as PA 43 and was cosigned with I-80S between King of Prussia and Center City Philadelphia and I-680 between Center City Philadelphia and the Walt Whitman Bridge when the Interstate Highway System was designated in 1956. Prior to the roadways being signed as interstates, I-395 was to be designated along the Schuylkill Expressway from the Vine Street Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge, however, I-680 was preferred to be the final designation for this route. On April 16, 1963, Pennsylvania wanted to renumber its Interstate numbers. Part of this was the renumbering from I-80S into I-76, and all of its auxiliary routes into I-x76. The Federal Highway Administration approved the request on February 26, 1964. As a result, I-80S became I-76 and I-680 became I-676. In addition to this renumbering, the PA 43 designation was removed from the Schuylkill Expressway. In 1972, the I-76 and the I-676 designations were switched onto their current routes, with the entire length of the Schuylkill Expressway designated as I-76. Immediately after its completion, operational studies performed on the Schuylkill Expressway found that the route would be unable to cope with the area's growing traffic demands, due to the many substandard design elements and compromises incorporated to cope with the rugged, difficult routing of the road. In 1962, plans were announced for a parallel expressway along the east bank of the Schuylkill, known as the Manayunk Expressway; however, these plans were quickly withdrawn due to substantial opposition. An alternative plan was then introduced to widen the entire highway to eight lanes in time for the United States Bicentennial in 1976; however, these plans were also shelved due to local disapproval. A scaled-down widening project was successfully undertaken from 1969 to 1972 to widen a short section of the road to six lanes through Fairmount Park. View of the Schuylkill Expressway from the Schuylkill River Trail In the decades since its opening, congestion on the expressway has steadily increased. Plans to expand the expressway to eight lanes by building an upper deck, including high-occupancy toll lanes, were advocated by former Pennsylvania House Speaker John Perzel, but have not come to fruition due to a lack of funding. PennDOT has planned a $23.7 million project, with testing by fall 2008, to add 29 webcams on the Schuylkill Expressway between the Conshohocken Curve and Passyunk Avenue. On the afternoon of June 8, 2011, a section of the Schuylkill Expressway near Grays Ferry Avenue buckled from temperatures around , causing lane closures. The closed lane of the road was later reopened after temporary repairs, but will require full repairs. On September 8, 2011, heavy rains caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee caused a rockslide in the vicinity of the Conshohocken Curve, flooding near Belmont Avenue and a mudslide by Girard Avenue. For hours, motorists were either stuck between the Blue Route and Girard Avenue or had to get off at the I-476 interchange until the mess could be cleaned up. In May 2011, a new westbound entrance was completed at South Gulph Road and South Henderson Road in King of Prussia. A westbound exit opened at this same location in November 2011. The new interchange cost $10.5 million and used money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. PennDOT undertook an $8 million project that would help reduce traffic congestion along the highway. By the middle of 2019, PennDOT plans to implement variable speed limit signs along the Schuylkill Expressway, where the speed limit can be lowered due to factors such as inclement weather or accidents. The project will also implement queue warning, which will use variable message signs to alert motorists to traffic congestion ahead and also coordinate with SEPTA to provide motorists real-time mass transit information to give commuters an option to exit the highway and use public transportation to finish their trip. There are also future plans to coordinate traffic signals on roads leading to the Schuylkill Expressway and install ramp meters on entrance ramps to the highway. PennDOT is in the preliminary stages of studying plans to use the right shoulder of the Schuylkill Expressway as a travel lane in certain sections during peak periods; construction of these lanes is not expected to begin until the 2020s. Exit list Mileposts and exit numbers reflect the entire length of I-76, which is concurrent with the Pennsylvania Turnpike from the Ohio state line to the Valley Forge Interchange.

The whole bay was reclaimed for the development of new town. Before reclamation, it was surrounded by places known as Tsing Leng Tsui, Sheung Ko Tan (上高灘), Ha Chung Mei, Tai Wong Ha (大王下) and Tsing Yi Town. The names of these places have since changed, and can now be translated, approximately, as Grand Horizon, Green Field Garden, Fung Shue Wo Road, Tsing Yi Estate and Tsing Yi Garden. Silting up The mud and sand in the stream of Liu To settled on the shores of Tsing Yi Bay. A marsh formed at the mouth of the stream and the water in the bay became shallower and shallower. Finally, an isthmus developed between Tsing Yi Town and Sheung Ko Tan. The inner water is now separated from the bay outside the isthmus to become Tsing Yi Lagoon. Reclamation In the 1980s the Hong Kong Government started to reclaim the bay in three phases. The bay has now been completely reclaimed and the shore has been straightened from Nga Ying Chau to Tsing Leng Tsui.

They had two vocalists; a male and a female. History =Formation and Anti-Nobunaga= The band started in Okinawa when Sassy and Meg left a Metallica cover band after they decided to make their own music. Sassy offered Mackaz the opportunity to join their new band, he accepted and invited long time friend Kazuto to join as well. Meg sat in on a school performance one day, and Yuusuke's voice stood out to him, so he offered him a chance to join the band. Initially Yuusuke declined due to wanting to be a solo singer, but joined after Meg reportedly asked him to join every day for nearly four months. The band, known as Anti-Nobunaga at this time, played mainly in small coffee shops and art theaters for about a year. Sassy, the bandleader, sent demo tapes to every major Japanese label, all of whom rejected the band. It was not until a small label signed the band that they found their first big break. Anti-Nobunaga were now playing areas further from their local hometown and eventually landed a spot at the yearly music festival of Okinawa. =Mākii joins and name change= During the summer of 2003, at the yearly music festival in Okinawa, the band's label promoted their spot and eventually they ended up playing for a sold-out crowd. Due to this festival being a \\"per show\\" ticket selling one, it meant that Anti-Nobunaga was the only band to play for a sold-out crowd. A scout for a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Japan was in the crowd and offered the band the chance to produce music for an upcoming various artists album entitled Okinawa 2003. The band then composed their two and only completely original songs under the name of Anti-Nobunaga entitled \\"Meaning\\" and \\"Hate You!\\". At another festival known as the \\"Music Picnic Festival\\", vocalist Mākii also grabbed the attention of the same scout that found Anti-Nobunaga. The scout felt that both projects on their own were not remarkable, but combined, the band could be something never before seen on the Japanese music scene. Mākii first rejected the offer due to her wanting to study English abroad, but was later convinced by her future bandmates to watch them perform. After she was impressed by the band's energy, Mākii agreed to join them. With the addition of Mākii the band took on a new name, High and Mighty Color. After six months of perfecting their craft, they moved up from SMJ's minor label to their major label, in league with bands such as Orange Range. High and Mighty Color is some times referred to as the sister band of Orange Range, because they are both from the Okinawa area, an area known for musical fusion thanks in part to various military bases stationed there and were both discovered at the same music festival. They spent much of 2004 writing and recording, in late 2004 they released their first single, \\"Over\\" which was only sold through Tower Records stores. It sold out in a month and became immensely scarce, thus it was re- released the next year. The album sat at number one spot of the indie Oricon charts for an entire month. =2005= During 2005, the band released their first major single, \\"Pride\\". It was originally going to be attached to a Japanese football event being held at the same time, but was picked up for something else. A Sunrise music partner was looking for a song to use for Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny and \\"Pride\\" was chosen to be that song. At the time, the show was the number one rated anime, and being attached to this helped the single's sales immensely. With a final sales count of 223,208 copies, \\"Pride\\" remains the band's best selling single of their career. Over the next year, the band went on a media blitz, performing for shows such as Music Fighter, Music Station and Hey! Hey! Hey! at various times. During August, the band released \\"Days\\", their fourth single, selling 7,679 copies and not breaking the top 20 mark on the Oricon charts. Despite this setback, the band was still honored with the Japanese Record Grand Prix's \\"Rookie of the Year\\" award, and Mākii's grandmother who had just died was given a tribute just before their performance. =2006: Gou on Progressive= In April 2006, the band released their second album Gou on Progressive after only releasing two singles for the album. The album sold less copies than their first album, but it stayed on the Oricon charts longer and managed to gain a higher peak position than their first album. The band's first single of the year was \\"Ichirin no Hana\\" and was used as the third opening to the anime adaption of Bleach. This was their first and only single to break the top five mark on the Oricon charts since their debut with \\"Pride.\\" They also played their first American concert at an anime convention in Houston, Texas on April 28. The band then went on a large-scale tour of Japan. They played 65 venues over the course of the next five months. They released their seventh single, \\"Dive into Yourself\\", in August. The song was used as the opening theme of the video game Sengoku Basara II. For a time this was the band's second lowest selling single and was also their lowest ranking single among the Oricon charts, only managing to reach the 24th spot on the weekly charts. Their 8th single \\"Enrai ~Tooku ni Aru Akari~\\" was released on October 25 and used as the ending theme for the third Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny: Special Edition compilation movie. The single entered the charts 12 spots higher than \\"Dive into Yourself\\" at number 12. \\"Energy\\", a B-side song from the \\"Style ~Get Glory in this Hand~\\" single, was used in a tribute compilation album composed for the movie Death Note: The Last Name. =2007: San= Mākii made her acting debut with the December 2006 movie, Anata wo Wasurenai (I Won't Forget You). The band performed two songs for the film, \\"Tadoritsuku Basho\\", the film's theme song, and \\"Oxalis\\", an insert song. The two songs were released as a double A-side single, \\"Tadoritsuku Basho/Oxalis\\". When Anata wo Wasurenai was released, it entered the Japanese box offices in the 10th position. Also, \\"Resistance\\" was used as the theme song for the Nintendo DS game, Kokui Hirameku Requiem. On February 4, the official High and Mighty Color website released various 30 second previews of songs from the band's third album, San, which was released on February 21. The album contained 15 tracks with 10 being new releases. The album was ranked number 10 on the Oricon daily rankings during its first day and 16th on the weekly charts. In March, it was announced that Yūsuke would work with former Porno Graffitti bassist, Masami Shiratama. Yūsuke provided vocals for the joint single entitled \\"Honnō\\", the single was released on May 23 featured Yūsuke using what the band describes as his \\"machine gun vocals\\". The band also made their second American performance on May 11 and May 12 during 2007's Anime Central anime convention. The 10th single from the band was released on August 1, 2007. The title track, \\"Dreams\\", was used as the second ending theme to the anime Darker Than Black. During its first week, the single entered the Oricon charts at the 24th spot. On November 4, 2007, the band announced the release of a single collection album entitled 10 Color Singles featuring their first 10 singles and a bonus track, \\"Ichirin no Hana (Live Studio Version)\\". It also includes a DVD with music videos that never made it to DVD like; \\"Style\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Here I Am\\", and the new music video for \\"Mushroom\\". In December, they contributed to Luna Sea Memorial Cover Album -Re:birth-, covering Luna Sea's song \\"Rosier\\". =2008: Rock Pit and Mākii leaves= High and Mighty Color's 12th single, \\"Flashback/Komorebi no Uta\\", was released on February 27, 2008. It was their second double a-side single and was used in promotion with the anime series Hero Tales. Their 4th album, Rock Pit, was released on March 19 and became their lowest selling album. The band began the fourth volume of their \\"Live Bee Loud\\" tour on March 17, 2008 at the famous Club Quattro in Japan. They then went on to perform at 13 other venues across the country, with the final venue being in their hometown of Okinawa. The 13th single of the band, \\"Hot Limit\\", is a cover of one of T.M. Revolution's early singles. The visual style of both the music video and the promotional images is meant to mimic that of the original. This was also the first time since \\"Dive into Yourself\\" that Sony Music Entertainment had produced a commercial for advertisement of a single from the band. The single went on to garner the best sales for the band in nearly two years and ranked at number 20 on the Oricon charts in the weekly rankings for its first week. On July 1, 2008, it was announced that Mākii had married Dreams Come True bassist Masato Nakamura on June 22, 2008 and would be leaving the band by the end of the year. In her parting message, Mākii thanked her fellow band members and all of their fans for supporting her and the group for such a long time. A special event was planned for Mākii's graduation from the band as well as at least one more single. It was also announced that the band will begin searching for a new vocalist in early 2009. High and Mighty Color appeared at the Zepp in Nagoya, alongside 175R, One Ok Rock and Gollbetty, on August 15 as part of the \\"Steal The Show Friday Night\\" lineup. The 14th single from the band, \\"Remember\\", was released on October 15, 2008 and is their final single featuring Mākii. =2009: Halca joins and Swamp Man= The band transferred to Spice Records on January 1, 2009. Spice Records was an Okinawa based studio that maintained minor rights to the band while under SME. The first live DVD from the band was released on January 25 and reached the 11th spot on the Oricon weekly DVD charts, reaching a peak of 9th on the daily charts. After the departure of Mākii, the band began auditions for a replacement vocalist; the auditions were open to women for a month before call backs and performances were done. On February 9, 2009, the band announced that a replacement vocalist was found, whose information would soon be added to their website after an extensive overhaul. The band planned to begin working on a summer single and live tour to promote the new vocalist in May. The first single, titled \\"XYZ\\", featuring the band's new vocalist Halca, was released on iTunes in both Japan and Australia on July 8, 2009. The band released their fifth album, Swamp Man, on September 2, 2009J-Pop World interview and took the 25th spot on the Oricon charts on its release date. Following the release of the album, High and Mighty Color released a tribute song for two popular manga named \\"Red\\". The song was released digitally in Japan on December 9, 2009 and re-released December 23, 2009 on iTunes Japan and Japan Files. =2010: Break up= On March 13, 2010, the band was scheduled to give a live concert with Halca, titled \\"Night Light Parade Vol. 1.1: One of the New Beginning\\" at Shibuya Club Quattro in Tokyo. It was announced on May 19 that on August 11 High and Mighty Color would release a single, \\"Re:ache\\", which would be the band's last. Explaining the breakup, band members cited \\"musical differences\\" and \\"future opportunities\\". \\"Re:ache\\" contained three new songs, with four songs in total, the fourth being a live rendition of \\"Red\\". The single was bundled with a DVD of the music videos for \\"Re:ache\\" and \\"Good Bye\\", as well as live recordings of their American concert from Sakura-Con 2010. After the band broke up, the members began separate activities. In 2017, Mackaz and Sassy reunited with Mākii to form the new band DracoVirgo.

Design The design of Valmy was decided by the Commission de Paris, as a way to modernise the 118-gun Océan class design and its derivatives. The most radical departure from previous designs was the shedding of tumblehome and adoption of vertical sides, shared by the Hercule and Suffren classes; this significantly increased the space available for upper batteries, but reduced the stability of the ship. Valmy was laid down at Brest in 1838 as Formidable and launched in 1847. She displayed poor performances during her trials, especially with a tendency to roll, and was generally considered a failure. Stability problems were to some extent improved by the addition of a high belt of wood sheathing at the waterline. The outcome of the project led the French Navy to return to a more traditional design with the next generation of ships, which would lead to Bretagne. Career Watercolour of the Valmy, by F. Roux Valmy participated in the Crimean War, where she proved difficult to manoeuvre and, like other sailing vessels, often had to be towed by steam ships. During the bombardment of Sevastopol, the only time Valmy fired her guns in anger, she was towed by the new steam two-decker Napoléon. On 13 November 1855, Valmy collided with the French schooner Etoile du Nord in the Mediterranean Sea. The schooner was dismasted and Valmy put in to Málaga, Spain. She returned to Brest in 1855, where she was disarmed. In 1864, she was renamed Borda and became a training hulk for the French Naval Academy. Upon her replacement in 1890, she was renamed Intrépide. She was stricken from the navy list in 1891 and scrapped soon afterwards.

Traveler is a horse who is the mascot of the University of Southern California. Traveler appears at all USC home football games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as well as many other outdoor events, including numerous Rose Parades. The current horse is Traveler IX. Although the Traveler web site describes Traveler as \\"pure white,\\" most of the horses who have served as Traveler are actually gray horses whose hair coats have become completely white. (Truly white horses are rare.) The rider, dressed as an idealized Trojan warrior, is often mistaken for Tommy Trojan, the Trojan portrayed in USC's famous Trojan Shrine statue; however, the rider is unnamed and simply designated as a Trojan warrior with the horse as the official mascot. On November 6, 2013, the costumed version of Tommy and Traveler were introduced for men's and women's basketball games.Chris Foster, USC basketball has a new mascot ... named Traveler, Los Angeles Times, November 6, 2014 Traveler horse statue The Coliseum Until it was renovated in the 1990s, the Coliseum included an Olympic running track going around the football field. This proved to be useful for Traveler, who would gallop around the track after every USC score and pump up the crowd. Once the track was removed, Traveler still made its way around the field but had to move cautiously to avoid people on the sidelines. The horse had a minor collision with a person in 2000, and afterwards had human spotters running in front to clear a path. Previous mascots Before Traveler, USC used another mascot, a series of canines known as George Tirebiter. There had also been several previous, unofficial horse mascots making appearances on USC sidelines since 1927, but none were permanent. The idea for the current mascot began during the 1961 Rose Parade, when a USC events director spotted Richard Saukko and his white horse, Traveler, marching in the parade. The university persuaded Saukko to ride his horse during USC football games. Introduction Traveler was introduced in the autumn of 1961, during the USC Trojans football team's home opener at the Coliseum, against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. To dress Saukko as a Trojan warrior, USC used its connections to the film industry to procure the costume worn by Charlton Heston in Ben Hur two years earlier. The costume proved to be too heavy for extended use, so Saukko made his own leather uniform for the 1962 season and the same costume has been used since. The name was believed to have been inspired by the gray horse Traveller, ridden by Civil War Confederate general Robert E. Lee, In August 2017 concerns that the horse's name had a connection to Lee led to further research, which revealed that the first Traveler was acquired with his name, spelled with one L, in 1958 after he had become unreliable as a movie horse. Daily Trojan, , August 23, 2017 On Equinespot.com, Traveler is listed as one of the six most common horse names to begin with the letter T. Popular Horse named Riders After Saukko retired from riding the horse in 1988, his family continued to provide the successive horses acting as Traveler until 2002. All of Saukko's successors as rider have been USC alumni, including Cass Dabbs, Rick Oas, Tom Nolan, Ardeshir Radpour, Brent Dahlgren, and current riders Chuck O'Donnell and Hector Aguilar. Different horses Several horses have been \\"Traveler\\" over the years, of breeds ranging from Tennessee Walking horses, to Arabian horses and some crossbred animals. The current mascot, Traveler IX, is a purebred Andalusian horse, owned by Joanne Asman. An eighth Traveler was in training, but according to a post on the Spirit of Troy Facebook account, Traveler 8 died on or about October 8, 2013. \\"It is with Sadness that I let you all know that Traveler number 8 who many of you did not have the opportunity to meet passed away. He was only 14 years old. For those who had the opportunity to see this bold, arched neck, beautiful creature run on the field for some of the games last year, he will be missed. Most of the fans did not realize when we switched Traveler 7 & Traveler 8 out, but for those who did know, he will be missed. Traveler 7 continues forward for his 11th year as Traveler.\\" Traveler VII was retired as the mascot following the 2017 Rose Bowl Game, with Traveler IX being introduced at the first USC home game of the 2017 season against Western Michigan.

The Kalbids were a Muslim Arab dynasty in Sicily, which ruled from 948 to 1053.They were formally appointed by the Fatimids, but gained, progressively, a de facto autonomous rule. In 827, in the midst of internal Byzantine conflict, the Aghlabids arrived at Marsala in Sicily, with a fleet of 10,000 men under the command of Asad ibn al-Furat. Palermo was conquered in 831 and became the new capital. Syracuse fell in 878 and in 902 the last Byzantine outpost, Taormina, was taken. At the same time various Muslim incursions into southern Italy occurred, with new Emirates being founded in Tropea, Taranto and Bari. During this period there were constant power struggles amongst the Muslims. Nominally the island was under rule of the Aghlabids and later the Fatimids. After successfully suppressing a revolt the Fatimid caliph appointed al-Hasan al-Kalbi (948–953) as Emir of Sicily, the first of the Kalbid dynasty. The Fatimids appointed the Kalbids as rulers via proxy before they shifted their capital from Ifriqiya to Cairo in 969. Raids into southern Italy continued under the Kalbids into the 11th century, and in 982 a German army under Otto II was defeated by Abu'l-Qasim in the Battle of Stilo near Crotone in Calabria. The dynasty began a steady period of decline with the Emirate of Yusuf al-Kalbi (990-998) who entrusted the island to his sons and created space for interference from the Zirids of Ifriqiya. Under al-Akhal (1017–1037) the dynastic conflict intensified, with factions allying themselves variously with Byzantium and the Zirids. Even though neither of these powers could establish themselves in Sicily permanently, under Hasan as-Samsam (1040–1053) the island fragmented into small fiefdoms. The Kalbids died out in 1053, and in 1061 the Normans of southern Italy arrived under Roger I of Sicily and began their conquest, which was completed in 1091. The Muslims were allowed to remain and played an important role in the administration, army and economy of the Norman kingdom until the 12th century. Under the Kalbid dynasty, Sicily, and especially Palermo, was an important economic centre of the Mediterranean. The Muslims introduced lemons, Seville oranges and sugar cane, as well as cotton and mulberries for sericulture, and built irrigation systems for agriculture. Sicily was also an important hub for trade between the Near East, North Africa and the Italian maritime republics such as Amalfi, Pisa and Genoa.

Likewise, Burton Cummings was to perform with Randy Bachman, but also didn't attend, apparently also due to illness. =Location= For weeks leading up to the concert, several locations were considered as potential hosts for the Canadian Live 8 concert. Parliament Hill, Ottawa, Ontario was the first choice for the concert. However, on June 10, the federal Public Works and Canadian Heritage departments, along with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police rejected the idea of using the site for Live 8. Government officials felt that Parliament Hill, with a capacity of 75,000 people was too small for the event, which was originally expected to attract over 150,000 participants. They were also concerned about damage to the local buildings and grounds. On June 15, Bob Geldof announced Toronto, Ontario as the host of the Canadian Live 8 concert. At that point, several venues were considered as candidates for the concert: Downsview Park, which hosted the Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto concert and a World Youth Day mass; Exhibition Place, which also hosted World Youth Day activities; Molson Amphitheatre, and Sunnyside Beach, which would have involved floating stages on Lake Ontario. Ultimately, none of these considerations were used for the concert. There were several financial and logistical problems related to these bids. For example, both Downsview Park and Molson Amphitheatre were hosting concerts on Canada Day (the day before Live 8) and it was impossible to set up the Live 8 stage a day before the concert. On June 21, Park Place in Barrie, Ontario was finally announced as the official venue for the Canadian Live 8 concert by promoter, Michael Cohl.

Nahant was launched on October 7, 1862, by Harrison Loring, South Boston, Massachusetts, and commissioned on December 29, 1862, Commander John Downes in command. Service history =Fort McAllister= The new single-turreted monitor joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Port Royal Harbor, South Carolina on February 20, 1863, and saw her first action in the Union bombardment of Fort McAllister on March 3. =Charleston= A little over a month later, she participated in Rear Admiral Samuel Francis du Pont's valiant but ill-fated attack on Charleston Harbor. The ironclads crossed Stono Bar and entered Charleston Harbor on 6 April, but a heavy fog stopped their advance lest they run aground attempting to negotiate the tricky channels leading to the vital Confederate port. Though dawn broke clear the next morning, an ebb tide kept the warships from getting underway until noon. Shortly after 15:00, 's guns opened on Fort Sumter, and through the afternoon Du Pont's ships stubbornly hammered at Confederate batteries while withstanding the intense and accurate converging fire of the Southern cannon. With darkness approaching and his ironclads severely battered, Du Pont broke off the action, determined to return to the fray at daybreak. That night, however, reports from his captains of the serious damage suffered by their ships convinced him that the small chance of success of another attack did not justify the great risk to his squadron. In the fighting, Nahant had been hit 36 times, disabling her turret and breaking off a large piece of iron inside her pilot house, killing her helmsman and wounding her pilot and two others. The whole fleet took 13 casualties. The next day, with her sister monitors, she retired to Port Royal for repairs. =CSS Atlanta engagement= On 10 June, after intelligence reports indicated that the ram was preparing to attack wooden blockader , Du Pont ordered Weehawken, Captain John Rodgers, and Nahant to Wassaw Sound, Georgia to await the powerful ironclad ram. Shortly before dawn, a week later, Atlanta, accompanied by stern wheel gunboat and ram , steamed down the Wilmington River and entered Wassaw Sound to attack the monitors. The Confederate flagship carried a torpedo projecting from her bow, hoping to explode it against one of the monitors before dispatching the other with her guns. Seeing the Southern ships approach, Weehawken and Nahant headed in to accept the challenge. As the adversaries closed to fighting range, Atlanta was first to fire, but soon ran aground, where she could not aim her guns effectively. The monitors held their fire until within . Weehawken then quickly put five rounds from her heavy guns into the ram. With two of his guns out of action, two of his three pilots severely wounded, and his ship hard aground, Cdr. William A. Webb, CSN, was compelled to surrender Atlanta while her escorts scurried to safety. Atlanta was subsequently purchased from a prize court by the Federal Government and commissioned in the Union Navy. =Blockade duty= Early in July, after he had taken command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Rear Adm. John A. Dahlgren ordered the monitors back to Charleston harbor. Nahant, now under the command of William Kennon Mayo, and her sisters bombarded Confederate works on Morris Island on July 10, supporting and covering the landing of Army troops. For almost two months, the shelling continued until the steadfast defenders were finally compelled to abandon Battery Wagner, their last position on the island, on September 6. In ensuing months, Nahant continued operations in the vicinity of Charleston, patrolling, enforcing the blockade, and bombarding Confederate positions ashore. On November 15, she joined in supporting the Union Army at Cumming's Point on Morris Island during a heavy evening bombardment from Fort Moultrie. The next day, despite heavy shelling from shore batteries, she helped refloat Lehigh after her sister monitor had run aground. On February 2, 1865, Nahant joined Lehigh and in shelling the Confederate blockade runner Presto after the blockade runner had run ashore under the batteries of Fort Moultrie. After three days of shelling, the hulk was completely destroyed. =Spanish–American War= Men and ship mascots aboard Nahant Men and ship mascots aboard Nahant Nahant decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 11, 1865. While laid up, she was renamed Atlas on June 15, 1869, but resumed the name Nahant on August 10. The veteran monitor recommissioned at League Island on April 12, 1898 and steamed to New York City for harbor defense during the Spanish–American War. Nahant decommissioned at League Island and was laid up there until sold on April 6, 1904, to L. E. Hunt of Melrose, Massachusetts. In literature Life aboard Nahant during the Civil War was documented in a book titled \\"A Year on a Monitor and the Destruction of Fort Sumter\\" by Alvah F Hunter. In 1862 Hunter enlisted in the Union Navy, with difficulty as he was only 16. He served for a year on Nahant as a cabin boy, keeping a careful diary. Later in life he wrote the book, which stands as one of the few detailed accounts of wartime routine on a monitor.

The lead locomotive here is in Phase II livery, while the trailing locomotive is still in Phase I. Amtrak has used a variety of liveries on its rolling stock since taking over intercity passenger rail service in the United States in 1971. A series of six schemes termed Phases, first introduced in 1972, have seen the widest use. Phases primarily use geometric arrangements of red, white, and blue—the national colors of the United States—part of Amtrak's patriotic visual identity. Amtrak began operations in May 1971 with a mixture of equipment still painted in the distinct liveries of the freight railroads that relinquished their passenger service to Amtrak. Amtrak picked and chose equipment that it determined to be in the best condition, and elected not to keep the same rolling stock on the same routes. Since (prior to Amtrak's operation) one almost never found rolling stock from anywhere in the country on any train, let alone rolling stock from competing railroads mixed together on the same train, that period was later known as the Rainbow Era. To build the brand of Amtrak as a unified passenger railroad, the rolling stock was gradually repainted into system-wide Phases starting around 1972 with Phase I. The Phases are sequentially numbered using Roman numerals. Phases were painted on all rolling stock, with locomotives and passenger cars often painted in different styles of the same Phase. Most current locomotives use the 2000-introduced Phase V, while passenger cars use the 2002-introduced Phase VI. A modified Phase III scheme was introduced for some equipment in 2013. Non-revenue equipment uses bright lime green or a variation of Phase V. The three routes under the Amtrak California branch—the Capitol Corridor, Pacific Surfliner, and San Joaquin—use equipment painted in several custom schemes, as do the Cascades and Piedmont. Amtrak has repainted equipment in unique livery for special uses, including its 40th anniversary in 2011 and to promote the Operation Lifesaver safety campaign. Equipment has also been wrapped for advertising promotions. When testing equipment from other railroads, Amtrak has mostly kept existing livery, though some longer-term tests used Phase schemes. Rainbow Era A \\"Rainbow Era\\" Amtrak trainset, 1971 When Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail service on May 1, 1971, it inherited a collection of rolling stock from twenty different railroads, each with its own distinct colors and logos. Needing only to operate 184 of the 366 trains that had been run nationwide by the private railroads, Amtrak was able to pick the 1,200 best passenger cars to lease from the 3,000 that the private railroads had owned. This equipment was haphazardly mixed to form consists, resulting in trains with the mismatched colors of several predecessor railroads. This \\"Rainbow Era\\" was short-lived; Amtrak began purchasing some of the leased equipment in mid-1971, setting the stage for wholesale repainting from 1972 to 1974. Phase paint schemes =Phase I= Introduced in 1972, Phase I was the first paint scheme to be implemented system-wide on Amtrak's trains. Except for a small number of locomotives that had been painted into experimental and promotional paint schemes, it was the first new paint for most equipment under Amtrak. The scheme was part of Amtrak's larger move to a visual identity featuring the national colors of red, white, and blue. Locomotives were painted a light gray (\\"Platinum Mist\\") with a black roof, the Amtrak \\"Pointless Arrow\\" chevron logo on the side, and a red nose (which led to a \\"Bloody Nose\\" nickname). Passenger cars were silver (or left bare stainless steel), with a red and bright blue stripe (bracketed by thin white stripes) at window level and the chevron logo at one or both ends. A number of variants were made for non-revenue locomotives, GG1 locomotives, Turbotrain and Turboliner trainsets, and self- propelled RDC and Metroliner railcars.

The red nose and chevron logo on locomotives were replaced with stripes similar to passenger cars. Most passenger cars were essentially unchanged from Phase I, except for the removal of the chevron logo; new Sightseer lounges had a higher stripe with an angled transition on each end. File:Amtrak 957 leading a northbound train through Bowie, December 1980.jpgGE E60 locomotive in 1980 File:Southbound Amtrak Metroliner with cab car 880 at Bowie, December 1980.jpgMetroliners in 1980 File:AMTK 303 with the Train 6, the California Zephyr in January, 1985 (28882632954).jpgSuperliner passenger cars in 1985 =Phase III= Phase III, introduced in 1976, is still used on some equipment. On both passenger cars and locomotives, the outer white pinstripes were removed while the inner stripe was widened, resulting in red, white, and blue stripes of equal width. Turboliners and the LRC test train were painted in white, with the stripes at the bottom of the train. This scheme was introduced \\"for safety, graphic aid and saving money\\", as the white band was highly reflective and provided a place for car information, and the standard widths made better use of raw material. Several types of locomotives that were acquired later were given variations on Phase III. AEM-7 locomotives had the blue stripe expanded to cover the entire lower part of the body. On Dash 8-32BWH locomotives, a deeper blue and red was used; the stripes had additional pinstripes and angled upward across the middle of the body. The similarity to the Pepsi logo led to the units being nicknamed \\"Pepsi Cans\\". Genesis locomotives had a lighter roof and narrower white stripe; the stripes angled downward on the sloped nose, and faded towards the rear. That variant was created by industrial designer Cesar Vergara, who also designed the angular bodies of the locomotives. In October 2013, Amtrak introduced a new variant of Phase III with the production of the new Viewliner II cars, the first of which entered service in 2015. The Viewliner cars have some changes from previous Phase III passenger cars, including a red reflective stripe at the bottom and a newer (\\"Travelmark\\") logo. In January 2016, Amtrak revealed a P32AC-DM that was repainted into Phase III, similar to that of the heritage units 145 and 822, but featuring modern logos and \\"Empire Service\\" emblems on the sides. All P32AC-DMs will eventually be repainted into this scheme, with costs shared between Amtrak and the state of New York.

Brought into service with the delivery of the newer Superliner II cars, Phase IV has two thin red stripes and a thick dark blue stripe. In 1997, Amtrak extended the scheme to locomotives, initially GE P42DC diesel locomotives on Northeast Corridor services.

Locomotives are painted light gray, with a blue stripe (darker than Phases I–III, but lighter than IV) at the top and a thin red reflective stripe at the bottom. The blue stripe has a wavy bottom on Genesis locomotives and a flat bottom on other locomotives and ex-F40PH non-powered control units (NPCUs). The Amtrak \\"Travelmark\\" logo is painted near the front or rear of the unit. SC-44 locomotives used on Midwest routes have a variant of Phase V with a blue front and a halftone transition into the grey side. Non-passenger cars like Auto Train autoracks are all-gray except for the logo and red stripe; Express Box Cars had blue stripes on top and bottom. Acela Express trainsets have grey and stainless steel bodies with the lower red stripe, with the wavy blue roof and Acela logo on the power cars only. The Acela passenger cars have no blue stripe; colored blobs called \\"mobiles\\" are used to indicate the type of car (Business Class, Cafe Bistro, or First Class). When the Acela Express was introduced, regional trains on the Northeast Corridor were briefly designated Acela Regional. Amfleet coaches for these trains received \\"Capstone\\" livery, which had a window stripe with various patterns of blue, light blue, and green to indicate the type of service. Rebuilt Turboliners had a similar variant of the Capstone livery.

It retains the same stripe style as Phase IV: wide window stripes on single-level cars, and narrow stripes on Superliners. The red reflective sill stripe and mid-tone blue on Phase V are used. Single-level cars have white logos within the blue stripe, while Superliners have blue logos below the stripes. Five of the first six ALC-42 Charger locomotives will have a \\"transitional\\" Phase VI scheme consisting of an all-blue body with red and black around the windshield, and a red and silver chevron at the rear. The remaining units will have a yet- undetermined paint scheme as part of a \\"fleet-wide plan\\".

Several other route-specific paint schemes have been used in the past. =Amtrak California= The three routes under the Amtrak California branch—the Capitol Corridor, Pacific Surfliner, and San Joaquin—use equipment painted in several custom schemes. The Capitol Corridor and San Joaquin largely use California Cars and F59PHI locomotives painted in the state colors of blue and yellow. Locomotives are grey with a navy blue underside, yellow bottom stripe, black roof, and navy blue cab area; Caltrans and Amtrak California logos are prominent. The California Cars are stainless steel with a black upper window stripe, a navy blue lower window stripe with a yellow pinstripe, and orange triangles next to boarding doors. Newer Siemens SC-44 Charger locomotives have navy blue curved shapes on the front and rear with yellow accents, a black cab area, and Amtrak California logos on the front and sides. Single-level Comet IB and Horizon cars used on the San Joaquin have a yellow bottom stripe and a navy blue window stripe with orange, turquoise, and light blue accents. Several NPCUs used for the service are grey with turquoise and light blue stripes and curve towards the top rear of the locomotive, red chevron stripes on the front (a nod to a 1985 Caltrain paint scheme), and yellow grab bars. The Pacific Surfliner uses SC-44 Charger locomotives and Surfliner cars in a deep blue and gray paint scheme. The upper half of the passenger cars are deep blue with a white pinstriping, plus a white pinstripe on the bottom of the cars. The stripes continue onto locomotives, with the blue stripe narrowing and curving under the black- painted cab area. Lettering is white and placed in the blue stripe. The Charger locomotives are painted in the same shape as the Northern California units but using the Pacific Surfliner color scheme. The first two Surfliner Chargers did not match the Surfliner cars. This issue was fixed starting with Charger 2111. Amtrak wrapped F59PHI 457 in a special scheme to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Pacific Surfliner and the train's ridership surpassing 25 million. The locomotive's new scheme was released on May 8, 2010, for National Train Day.

The five older Talgo VII trainsets have the passenger cars split evenly between tan on top, brown in middle, and dark green on bottom. The transition baggage cars at the end have the green curve above the other colors, where it matches with a green curve on the older locomotives and NPCUs. The scheme was created by industrial designer Cesar Vergara, who also styled the GE Genesis locomotive. On the newer SC-44 Charger locomotives, the green stripe is narrower and runs along the top and over the cab. One trainset was originally painted in blue, silver, and white for a Los Angeles-Las Vegas service that was never implemented. In 2016, one NPCU, #90250, was wrapped in Seattle Seahawks livery for several months. The newer Series 8 trainsets are painted similarly to the older sets. One end has a cab car, where the brown and green stripes come to a point, with the top of the cab also painted green.

They were painted white with red stripes to match the signature colors of the Wisconsin Badgers sports teams. * The state-owned equipment used on the Piedmont is painted in North Carolina state colors, with wide blue stripes on the passenger cars and blue fronts on the locomotives.

The locomotive was painted black; the Chevron \\"pointless arrow\\" logo on each side wrapped around the front with blue and white safety stripes. =Operation Lifesaver livery= In late 2008, Amtrak wrapped F59PHI No. 455 in an Operation Lifesaver paint scheme to promote a Caltrans safety campaign. The wrap featured a surfer with a surfboard standing in the middle of railroad tracks during a sunset. The words \\"Stay off, stay away, stay alive\\" were printed on both sides. The locomotive was restored to its original livery in 2010. Other locomotives painted for Operation Lifesaver have included F59PHI No. 2007 in a yellow paint scheme with several printed slogans and No. 457 in a blue scheme with a pattern of handprints and the words \\"BE TRACK SMART\\". =40th anniversary livery= For Amtrak's 40th anniversary in 2011, four P42DC locomotives received a special version of Phase I through Phase IV paint schemes. From January through April 2011, Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops outside Indianapolis repainted the units and sent them north on the Hoosier State to Chicago, where they were cycled into regular service on other routes. The Anniversary locomotives were selected from units scheduled for repainting or recent wreck rebuilds. The first repainted locomotive was No. 145 in Phase III paint, which led the Capitol Limited on January 30, 2011. Three other locomotives followed: Nos. 156 in Phase I, 66 in Phase II, and 184 in Phase IV. P42DC No. 130 was painted in the Phase II livery after No. 66 was damaged beyond repair. The 40th Anniversary Exhibit Train consisted of P40DC locomotive No. 822, NPCU No. 406, modified Budd 10-6 heritage sleeper/Crew Dorm No. 10020 Pacific Bend, three heritage baggage cars used as exhibit cars, and reconfigured Amfleet cafe car No. 85999. The whole train was painted in Phase III.

Locomotive Nos. 600 and 601 received a large American flag on the sides as well as smaller logos for Siemens & Amtrak. Locomotive No. 602 had a special \\"Reliability - Efficiency - Mobility\\" infographic on the sides. All three were later repainted with a conventional Phase V scheme before entering service. =Veterans units= ACS-64 No. 642 in the Veterans scheme in 2016 In June 2013, P42DC #42 was painted in a red, white, black, and dark blue scheme with a large logo on the side saying \\"America's Railroad Salutes our Veterans\\". A blue band near the wheelbase contains 50 white stars. ACS-64 Nos. 642 and NPCUs Nos. 90208 and 90221 received similar paint schemes in 2015 and 2016. Non-revenue equipment An Amtrak catenary maintenance vehicle in 2004-introduced lime paint Beginning in 1976, Amtrak work train equipment was painted safety orange with black undersides. Light grey livery with a red bottom stripe, similar to Phase V non-passenger cars, was introduced for work train cars in 2004. Safety yellow livery was introduced for maintenance of way equipment and roadway vehicles in 2001; it was replaced with a pale lime around 2004, and a brighter lime around 2013. Non-revenue locomotives typically use variations of the Phase paint schemes to make them visually distinct from revenue locomotives while maintaining consistent styles. In 1997, Amtrak bought 50 rebuilt boxcars to supplement its newly built Express Box Car fleet. The rebuilt cars arrived in their original Southern Pacific Olive Green paint scheme, rather than the Phase V scheme of the newer cars, though some were later repainted. Advertising Union Station in Washington, D.C. in 1999. Since the late 1990s, Amtrak has occasionally rented advertising space on the exterior of its passenger equipment. The ads sometimes take the form of wraps rather than true paint schemes. Customers have included fast food restaurants, auto manufacturers, television networks, and politicians. In some cases, the advertisements were on equipment rented for private use, rather than on equipment in normal revenue service. Notable temporary advertisements have included: * In 1999 and 2000, a four-car train including P42DC locomotive No. 100, a baggage car, a 1926 railway post office car, a business car, and an exhibit car was used for the United States Postal Service's \\"Celebrate the Century Express Educational Train Tour\\". The scheme consisted of a elaborate collection of enlarged stamps and postmarks from 1900 to the 1990s. * In October 2003, P42DC No. 203 and five Amfleet cars were wrapped in a scheme featuring Monopoly game pieces and money. The train was used as the \\"Reading Railroad\\", a special train from Chicago to Atlantic City, New Jersey upon which the first rounds of the 2003 U.S. National Championship were held. * In August 2004, presidential candidate John Kerry traveled on the \\"Kerry-Edwards Special\\", which used P42DC No. 138 wrapped with a \\"BELIEVE IN AMERICA TOUR\\" as the lead unit. * In November and December 2007, a full Acela Express trainset was wrapped to promote The History Channel's show 1968 with Tom Brokaw. The wrap was criticized by passengers for impeding the view from inside the train. A similar wrap was used in 2010 to promote the TLC show Cake Boss. Test train schemes A Bombardier LRC in experimental Phase III livery. Amtrak has tested a number of types of off-the-shelf equipment on the Northeast Corridor and short corridors. Some of these have been painted fully in Amtrak livery: * Bombardier LRC cars received a variation of the Phase III scheme very similar to the RTL Turboliners. * The Swedish Rc4 (numbered X995) and the French CC 21000 (X996), used for testing during the design of the AEM-7 locomotives in the late 1970s, used a Phase II scheme similar to the E60 locomotives the AEM-7 would replace. The Talgo 200 in Northwest Talgo service in 1994 Other equipment largely retained their paint schemes from usage elsewhere: * A Siemens ICE 1 trainset and a Kalmar Verkstad X2000 trainset were tested on the Northeast Corridor and several other routes in 1992 and 1993. The X2000 retained its Statens Järnvägar livery of silver with blue stripes, although it did receive Amtrak lettering; it was pulled by Amtrak diesels on non- electrified routes. The ICE 1 retained its Deutsche Bahn livery of white with a two-tone red stripe, again with Amtrak lettering. On non-electrified routes, it was pulled by two Siemens F69PHAC diesel locomotives painted in the same red-on-white scheme. * After non-revenue testing on the Northeast Corridor in 1988, a Talgo 200 trainset was tested in revenue service between Portland and Seattle in 1994 as the Northwest Talgo. The AVE paint scheme of white with a thick blue window stripe was modified with a thin Phase II red, white, and blue stripe below the windows. * In 1996, two Adtranz IC3 \\"Flexliner\\" trainsets were tested on several Amtrak routes in California, as well as the Metrolink Antelope Valley Line. They retained their Israel Railways livery of white with red, black, and blue sections, with some Amtrak lettering added.

Pepper costumes during their performance together. However, when the show took place, the costumes were worn by a four-piece French horn section of free-lance London area players, Richard Steggall, Adam Walters, Joe Walters, and Matt Gunner. Immediately following Travis' performance, Bob Geldof told the audience that he \\"couldn't resist playing on this stage\\" and played the Boomtown Rats song \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\". He had earlier said that he did not deserve to play alongside the scheduled acts. Both The Cure and Muse were originally listed on the Live 8 website as appearing at the Live 8 London concert. During a BBC TV documentary called The Live 8 Story, the names of both acts are visible on a provisional running order compiled during a production meeting between Geldof, Richard Curtis, Harvey Goldsmith and various other parties. In the end, both acts played the Paris Live 8 concert. All the songs performed by Sting were sung twenty years before at Live Aid. Mariah Carey performed a medley of her hits \\"Make It Happen\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", and \\"Hero\\" where she was accompanied by a children’s choir. Some artists already had shows planned for 2 July which they performed after their performances at Live 8. Accordingly, they were not present for the \\"Hey Jude\\" grand finale. The event marked the first time in 24 years that Pink Floyd's seminal line-up would perform. Originally scheduled to close at 21:30 the concert overran and went on until about 00:30, leaving many in the audience with no means of returning home. As he had done at Live Aid 20 years previously, Harvey Goldsmith appeared on stage to thank the audience for their patience with the late-running event and to make a closing appeal for people to leave slowly to avoid crushes. Coverage =Television= Jonathan Ross and Ricky Gervais in the BBC TV studio at Live 8 with the concert audience in the background In the United Kingdom, the BBC provided full television coverage, starting on BBC Two from 13:00 and continuing from 18:15 on BBC One, right up to the end of the concert at 00:00. The advertised changeover time was 16:15, disappointing many who had set video recorders accordingly. The coverage was presented by Jonathan Ross, Fearne Cotton, Jo Whiley and Graham Norton. 350 complaints were made to the BBC about swearing before the 21:00 watershed. The BBC apologised, however a spokesman said: In Ireland, the concert was broadcast on RTÉ Two, whose coverage ran from 14:00 to 00:00 (except 17:00 to 18:00, when the coverage switched to RTÉ One). The coverage was presented by Dave Fanning and Laura Woods. In the United States, MTV and VH1 provided intermittent and incomplete live and taped coverage, frequently breaking away mid-song for commercials or commentary by their VJs. This decision drew criticism from numerous viewers who viewed the commentary as being frivolous or inane and would have preferred to see the music acts themselves. However, AOL provided a full webcast of the entire show. After the criticism from viewers, both VH1 and MTV showed highlights of the Live 8 concerts on 9 July 2005 for 5 hours each without commercial interruption. In Australia, the concert was broadcast on FOX8 (live) and the Nine Network (highlights). =Radio= In the UK, there was radio coverage on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 5 Live and several local radio stations. The Radio 1 coverage was presented by Chris Moyles, Scott Mills, Edith Bowman, Colin Murray, Sara Cox and Vernon Kay. While the Radio 2 presenters were Chris Evans, Davina McCall and Dermot O'Leary. Each station focussed on artists who matched the station's playlisting policy and target audience. The Radio 5 Live coverage was presented by Brian Alexander, Phil Williams and Aasmah Mir. The coverage also focused on the Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh and the Wimbledon Women's Singles Final. Most commercial radio stations in the UK took a programme produced by Capital FM for the day, presented by Ulrika Jonsson. In the US, XM Satellite Radio broadcast the concert in its entirety. =BBC Big Screens= The BBC also had live coverage on big screens across the UK. ;England *London – south part of Hyde Park *Manchester – Exchange Square *Birmingham – Chamberlain Square *Birmingham – Cannon Hill Park *Liverpool – Clayton Square *Hull – Queen Victoria Square *Leeds – Millennium Square *Gateshead – Gateshead International Stadium *Bournemouth – Meyrick Park *Plymouth – Armada Way ;Wales *Cardiff – Cooper's Field, Bute Park *Wrexham – Queens Square ;Northern Ireland *Belfast – Custom House Square ;Scotland *Inverness – Caledonian Stadium ;Channel Islands *St. Helier, Jersey – Peoples Park *Guernsey – L'Eree Category:2005 in London Category:Live 8 events Category:Music in London Category:2005 in British music Category:July 2005 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"Live 8 concert, London"},{"id":"2144007","text":"In mathematics, the derivative is a fundamental construction of differential calculus and admits many possible generalizations within the fields of mathematical analysis, combinatorics, algebra, and geometry.  Derivatives in analysis  In real, complex, and functional analysis, derivatives are generalized to functions of several real or complex variables and functions between topological vector spaces. An important case is the variational derivative in the calculus of variations. Repeated application of differentiation leads to derivatives of higher order and differential operators. = Multivariable calculus = The derivative is often met for the first time as an operation on a single real function of a single real variable. One of the simplest settings for generalizations is to vector valued functions of several variables (most often the domain forms a vector space as well). This is the field of multivariable calculus. In one-variable calculus, we say that a function f: \\\\R \\\\to \\\\R is differentiable at a point x if the limit :\\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} exists. Its value is then the derivative ƒ'(x). A function is differentiable on an interval if it is differentiable at every point within the interval. Since the line L(z) = f'(x)(z - x) + f(x) is tangent to the original function at the point (x, f(x)), the derivative can be seen as a way to find the best linear approximation of a function. If one ignores the constant term, setting L(z) = f'(x)z, L(z) becomes an actual linear operator on R considered as a vector space over itself. This motivates the following generalization to functions mapping \\\\R^m to \\\\R^n: ƒ is differentiable at x if there exists a linear operator A(x) (depending on x) such that :\\\\lim_{\\\\h\\\\ \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\f(x+h) - f(x) - A(x)h\\\\}{\\\\h\\\\} = 0. Although this definition is perhaps not as explicit as the above, if such an operator exists, then it is unique, and in the one-dimensional case coincides with the original definition. (In this case the derivative is represented by a 1-by-1 matrix consisting of the sole entry f'(x).) Note that, in general, we concern ourselves mostly with functions being differentiable in some open neighbourhood of x rather than at individual points, as not doing so tends to lead to many pathological counterexamples. An n by m matrix, of the linear operator A(x) is known as Jacobian matrix Jx(ƒ) of the mapping ƒ at point x. Each entry of this matrix represents a partial derivative, specifying the rate of change of one range coordinate with respect to a change in a domain coordinate. Of course, the Jacobian matrix of the composition g°f is a product of corresponding Jacobian matrices: Jx(g°f) =Jƒ(x)(g)Jx(ƒ). This is a higher-dimensional statement of the chain rule. For real valued functions from Rn to R (scalar fields), the total derivative can be interpreted as a vector field called the gradient. An intuitive interpretation of the gradient is that it points \\"up\\": in other words, it points in the direction of fastest increase of the function. It can be used to calculate directional derivatives of scalar functions or normal directions. Several linear combinations of partial derivatives are especially useful in the context of differential equations defined by a vector valued function Rn to Rn. The divergence gives a measure of how much \\"source\\" or \\"sink\\" near a point there is. It can be used to calculate flux by divergence theorem. The curl measures how much \\"rotation\\" a vector field has near a point. For vector- valued functions from R to Rn (i.e., parametric curves), one can take the derivative of each component separately. The resulting derivative is another vector valued function. This is useful, for example, if the vector-valued function is the position vector of a particle through time, then the derivative is the velocity vector of the particle through time. The convective derivative takes into account changes due to time dependence and motion through space along vector field. = Convex analysis = The subderivative and subgradient are generalizations of the derivative to convex functions. = Higher-order derivatives and differential operators = One can iterate the differentiation process, that is, apply derivatives more than once, obtaining derivatives of second and higher order. A more sophisticated idea is to combine several derivatives, possibly of different orders, in one algebraic expression, a differential operator. This is especially useful in considering ordinary linear differential equations with constant coefficients. For example, if f(x) is a twice differentiable function of one variable, the differential equation : f+2f'-3f=4x-1\\\\, may be rewritten in the form : L(f)=4x-1,\\\\, where L=\\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+2\\\\frac{d}{dx}-3 is a second order linear constant coefficient differential operator acting on functions of x. The key idea here is that we consider a particular linear combination of zeroth, first and second order derivatives \\"all at once\\". This allows us to think of the set of solutions of this differential equation as a \\"generalized antiderivative\\" of its right hand side 4x − 1, by analogy with ordinary integration, and formally write : f(x)=L^{-1}(4x-1).\\\\, Higher derivatives can also be defined for functions of several variables, studied in multivariable calculus. In this case, instead of repeatedly applying the derivative, one repeatedly applies partial derivatives with respect to different variables. For example, the second order partial derivatives of a scalar function of n variables can be organized into an n by n matrix, the Hessian matrix. One of the subtle points is that the higher derivatives are not intrinsically defined, and depend on the choice of the coordinates in a complicated fashion (in particular, the Hessian matrix of a function is not a tensor). Nevertheless, higher derivatives have important applications to analysis of local extrema of a function at its critical points. For an advanced application of this analysis to topology of manifolds, see Morse theory. As in the case of functions of one variable, we can combine first and higher order partial derivatives to arrive at a notion of a partial differential operator. Some of these operators are so important that they have their own names: *The Laplace operator or Laplacian on R3 is a second-order partial differential operator Δ given by the divergence of the gradient of a scalar function of three variables, or explicitly as :: \\\\Delta=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial z^2}. Analogous operators can be defined for functions of any number of variables. *The d'Alembertian or wave operator is similar to the Laplacian, but acts on functions of four variables. Its definition uses the indefinite metric tensor of Minkowski space, instead of the Euclidean dot product of R3: :: \\\\square=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial z^2}-\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2}. = Weak derivatives = Given a function u:\\\\R^n\\\\to\\\\R which is locally integrable, but not necessarily classically differentiable, a weak derivative may be defined by means of integration by parts. First define test functions, which are infinitely differentiable and compactly supported functions \\\\varphi \\\\in C^{\\\\infty}_c(\\\\R^n), and multi-indices, which are length n lists of integers \\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\dots, \\\\alpha_n) with \\\\alpha := \\\\sum_1^n \\\\alpha_i. Applied to test functions, D^{\\\\alpha} \\\\varphi := \\\\frac{\\\\partial^{\\\\alpha} \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x_1^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\dots x_n^{\\\\alpha_n}}. Then the \\\\alpha^{\\\\text{th}} weak derivative of u exists if there is a function v:\\\\R^n\\\\to\\\\R such that for all test functions \\\\varphi, we have \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} u \\\\ D^{\\\\alpha} \\\\\\\\!\\\\varphi\\\\ dx = (-1)^{\\\\alpha} \\\\int_{\\\\R^n} v \\\\ \\\\varphi \\\\ dx If such a function exists, then D^{\\\\alpha} u := v , which is unique almost everywhere. This definition coincides with the classical derivative for functions u \\\\in C^{\\\\alpha}(\\\\R^n) , and can be extended to a type of generalized functions called distributions, the dual space of test functions. Weak derivatives are particularly useful in the study of partial differential equations, and within parts of functional analysis. = Analysis on fractals = Laplacians and differential equations can be defined on fractals. = Fractional derivatives = In addition to n th derivatives for any natural number n, there are various ways to define derivatives of fractional or negative orders, which are studied in fractional calculus. The −1 order derivative corresponds to the integral, whence the term differintegral. = Complex analysis = In complex analysis, the central objects of study are holomorphic functions, which are complex-valued functions on the complex numbers satisfying a suitably extended definition of differentiability. The Schwarzian derivative describes how a complex function is approximated by a fractional-linear map, in much the same way that a normal derivative describes how a function is approximated by a linear map. The Wirtinger derivatives are a set of differential operators that permit the construction of a differential calculus for complex functions that is entirely analogous to the ordinary differential calculus for functions of real variables. = Quaternionic analysis = In quaternionic analysis, derivatives can be defined in a similar way to real and complex functions. Since the quaternions \\\\;\\\\mathbb{H}\\\\; are not commutative, the limit of the difference quotient yields two different derivatives: A left derivative :\\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0}\\\\left[\\\\; h^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\,f\\\\left( a + h \\\\right) - f\\\\left( a \\\\right)\\\\,\\\\right)\\\\;\\\\right] and a right derivative :\\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0}\\\\left[\\\\; \\\\left(\\\\,f\\\\left( a + h \\\\right) - f\\\\left( a \\\\right)\\\\,\\\\right) h^{-1} \\\\;\\\\right]~. The existence of these limits are very restrictive conditions. For example, if \\\\;f:\\\\mathbb{H} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{H}\\\\; has left-derivatives at every point on an open connected set \\\\;U \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{H}\\\\;, then \\\\; f(q) = a + q\\\\,b \\\\; for \\\\;a,\\\\,b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{H}\\\\;. = Functional analysis = In functional analysis, the functional derivative defines the derivative with respect to a function of a functional on a space of functions. This is an extension of the directional derivative to an infinite dimensional vector space. The Fréchet derivative allows the extension of the directional derivative to a general Banach space. The Gateaux derivative extends the concept to locally convex topological vector spaces. Fréchet differentiability is a strictly stronger condition than Gateaux differentiability, even in finite dimensions. Between the two extremes is the quasi-derivative. In measure theory, the Radon–Nikodym derivative generalizes the Jacobian, used for changing variables, to measures. It expresses one measure μ in terms of another measure ν (under certain conditions). In the theory of abstract Wiener spaces, the H-derivative defines a derivative in certain directions corresponding to the Cameron-Martin Hilbert space. On a function space, the linear operator which assigns to each function its derivative is an example of a differential operator. General differential operators include higher order derivatives. By means of the Fourier transform, pseudo-differential operators can be defined which allow for fractional calculus. =Analogues of derivatives in fields of positive characteristic= The Carlitz derivative is an operation similar to usual differentiation have been devised with the usual context of real or complex numbers changed to local fields of positive characteristic in the form of formal Laurent series with coefficients in some finite field Fq (it is known that any local field of positive characteristic is isomorphic to a Laurent series field). Along with suitably defined analogs to the exponential function, logarithms and others the derivative can be used to develop notions of smoothness, analycity, integration, Taylor series as well as a theory of differential equations. Difference operator, q-analogues and time scales * The q-derivative of a function is defined by the formula : D_q f(x)=\\\\frac{f(qx)-f(x)}{(q-1)x}. For x nonzero, if f is a differentiable function of x then in the limit as q → 1 we obtain the ordinary derivative, thus the q-derivative may be viewed as its q-deformation. A large body of results from ordinary differential calculus, such as binomial formula and Taylor expansion, have natural q-analogues that were discovered in the 19th century, but remained relatively obscure for a big part of the 20th century, outside of the theory of special functions. The progress of combinatorics and the discovery of quantum groups have changed the situation dramatically, and the popularity of q-analogues is on the rise. * The difference operator of difference equations is another discrete analog of the standard derivative. :\\\\Delta f(x)=f(x+1)-f(x)\\\\, * The q-derivative, the difference operator and the standard derivative can all be viewed as the same thing on different time scales. For example, taking \\\\epsilon = (q-1)x , we may have : \\\\frac{f(qx)-f(x)}{(q-1)x} = \\\\frac{f(x+\\\\epsilon)-f(x)}{\\\\epsilon}. The q-derivative is a special case of Hahn difference, : \\\\frac{f(qx+\\\\omega)-f(x)}{qx+\\\\omega-x}. Hahn difference is not only a generalization of q-derivative but also an extension of forward difference. * Also note that the q-derivative is nothing but a special case of the familiar derivative. Take z = qx . Then we have, :\\\\lim_{z \\\\to x}\\\\frac{f(z) - f(x)}{z - x} = \\\\lim_{q \\\\to 1}\\\\frac{f(qx) - f(x)}{qx - x} = \\\\lim_{q \\\\to 1}\\\\frac{f(qx)-f(x)}{(q-1)x}.  Derivatives in algebra  In algebra, generalizations of the derivative can be obtained by imposing the Leibniz rule of differentiation in an algebraic structure, such as a ring or a Lie algebra. = Derivations = A derivation is a linear map on a ring or algebra which satisfies the Leibniz law (the product rule). Higher derivatives and algebraic differential operators can also be defined. They are studied in a purely algebraic setting in differential Galois theory and the theory of D-modules, but also turn up in many other areas, where they often agree with less algebraic definitions of derivatives. For example, the formal derivative of a polynomial over a commutative ring R is defined by :(a_dx^d + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \\\\cdots+a_1x+a_0)' = da_dx^{d-1}+(d-1)a_{d-1}x^{d-2} + \\\\cdots+a_1. The mapping f\\\\mapsto f' is then a derivation on the polynomial ring R[X]. This definition can be extended to rational functions as well. The notion of derivation applies to noncommutative as well as commutative rings, and even to non- associative algebraic structures, such as Lie algebras. See also Pincherle derivative and Arithmetic derivative. = Commutative algebra = In commutative algebra, Kähler differentials are universal derivations of a commutative ring or module. They can be used to define an analogue of exterior derivative from differential geometry that applies to arbitrary algebraic varieties, instead of just smooth manifolds. = Number theory = In p-adic analysis, the usual definition of derivative is not quite strong enough, and one requires strict differentiability instead. Also see arithmetic derivative and Hasse derivative. = Type theory = Many abstract data types in mathematics and computer science can be described as the algebra generated by a transformation that maps structures based on the type back into the type. For example, the type T of binary trees containing values of type A can be represented as the algebra generated by the transformation 1+A×T2→T. The \\"1\\" represents the construction of an empty tree, and the second term represents the construction of a tree from a value and two subtrees. The \\"+\\" indicates that a tree can be constructed either way. The derivative of such a type is the type that describes the context of a particular substructure with respect to its next outer containing structure. Put another way, it is the type representing the \\"difference\\" between the two. In the tree example, the derivative is a type that describes the information needed, given a particular subtree, to construct its parent tree. This information is a tuple that contains a binary indicator of whether the child is on the left or right, the value at the parent, and the sibling subtree. This type can be represented as 2×A×T, which looks very much like the derivative of the transformation that generated the tree type. This concept of a derivative of a type has practical applications, such as the zipper technique used in functional programming languages.  Derivatives in geometry  Main types of derivatives in geometry is Lie derivatives along a vector field, exterior differential, and covariant derivatives. = Differential topology = In differential topology, a vector field may be defined as a derivation on the ring of smooth functions on a manifold, and a tangent vector may be defined as a derivation at a point. This allows the abstraction of the notion of a directional derivative of a scalar function to general manifolds. For manifolds that are subsets of Rn, this tangent vector will agree with the directional derivative defined above. The differential or pushforward of a map between manifolds is the induced map between tangent spaces of those maps. It abstracts the Jacobian matrix. On the exterior algebra of differential forms over a smooth manifold, the exterior derivative is the unique linear map which satisfies a graded version of the Leibniz law and squares to zero. It is a grade 1 derivation on the exterior algebra. The Lie derivative is the rate of change of a vector or tensor field along the flow of another vector field. On vector fields, it is an example of a Lie bracket (vector fields form the Lie algebra of the diffeomorphism group of the manifold). It is a grade 0 derivation on the algebra. Together with the interior product (a degree -1 derivation on the exterior algebra defined by contraction with a vector field), the exterior derivative and the Lie derivative form a Lie superalgebra. = Differential geometry = In differential geometry, the covariant derivative makes a choice for taking directional derivatives of vector fields along curves. This extends the directional derivative of scalar functions to sections of vector bundles or principal bundles. In Riemannian geometry, the existence of a metric chooses a unique preferred torsion-free covariant derivative, known as the Levi-Civita connection. See also gauge covariant derivative for a treatment oriented to physics. The exterior covariant derivative extends the exterior derivative to vector valued forms. = Geometric calculus = In geometric calculus, the geometric derivative satisfies a weaker form of the Leibniz rule. It specializes the Frechet derivative to the objects of geometric algebra. Geometric calculus is a powerful formalism that has been shown to encompass the similar frameworks of differential forms and differential geometry.David Hestenes, Garrett Sobczyk: Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus, a Unified Language for mathematics and Physics (Dordrecht/Boston:G.Reidel Publ.Co., 1984,  Other generalizations  It may be possible to combine two or more of the above different notions of extension or abstraction of the original derivative. For example, in Finsler geometry, one studies spaces which look locally like Banach spaces. Thus one might want a derivative with some of the features of a functional derivative and the covariant derivative. The study of stochastic processes requires a form of calculus known as the Malliavin calculus. One notion of derivative in this setting is the H-derivative of a function on an abstract Wiener space. Multiplicative calculus replaces addition with multiplication, and hence rather than dealing with the limit of a ratio of differences, it deals with the limit of an exponentiation of ratios. This allows the development of the geometric derivative and bigeometric derivative. Moreover, just like the classical differential operator has a discrete analog, the difference operator, there are also discrete analogs of these multiplicative derivatives.

Examples include: climbing the highest point of each U.S. state; reaching the highest point of each county within a specific state; and ascending the highest mountain on each continent (the \\"Seven Summits\\").  Overview  While highpointing takes its adherents to the apex of dangerous and spectacular mountains, it also leads people to climb much less notable hilltops in pursuit of their goal. An example of this can be found in those who climb the highest point of each U.S. state. This requires ascents not only of Denali and Mount Rainier, two of North America’s most impressive peaks, but also to the tops of such states as Delaware and Rhode Island, where most people would contend there are no actual mountains to climb. The heterogeneous nature of these summits is usually considered part of the appeal, as the travel and cultural experiences en route to the climbs are often valued as highly as the climbs themselves. This sport is practiced all around the world, though it seems the most popular in the United States. The most prominent groups of \\"highpointers\\" in the U.S. attempt to either climb to the highest point of each state in the U.S. or to the highest point in each county within a specific U.S. state. These activities are called \\"state\\" and \\"county\\" highpointing, respectively. Other notable highpointing pursuits include climbing the Seven Summits, ascending to the highest mountain in each country in Europe, and reaching the top of each state or province in one’s home country. Highpointing is related to, but different than peakbagging. Peakbaggers usually climb every peak above a certain height in a specific region (like the Munros or the Colorado Fourteeners), whereas highpointers would climb just one summit in each region of a larger geographical area. The goal of many highpointers is to ascend to every highpoint on their list; however, many others undertake highpointing for the experience of climbing as many highpoints as they find enjoyable, with no expectation of doing them all.  History and first ascents  Starting in the early 20th century, a few pioneers of highpointing began visiting the highest geographic point in each of the 50 states of the United States. In the early days, this endeavor involved dispute and original research, as the tools to precisely map every square inch of the country were just beginning to find widespread use - and this was part of the charm. The first person to successfully climb each U.S. state highpoint was A.H. Marshall, who completed the task in July, 1936, when there were only 48 states. Marshall's 48th highpoint to complete the task was Indiana's modest Hoosier Hill. Only four individuals are known to have completed all 48 states before the addition of Alaska and Hawaii in 1959. The first person to climb to the top of all 50 U.S. states was Vin Hoeman in 1966. Since then, about 250 people have successfully climbed to the top of each U.S. state. Mount Everest, by comparison, has seen over 5,000 ascents by more than 3,000 individuals. In 1986, Jack Longacre placed an ad in Outside magazine which led the next year to the formation of the Highpointers Club , which is devoted to climbs of U.S. state highpoints. Participation in county highpointing in the U.S. varies widely among states, with few states being climbed by more than a few dozen individuals. See County Highpointers Club for more information. The Seven Summits including Mount Kosciusko was first completed in 1985 by Dick Bass. At least 350 people have climbed all seven since then. There is some dispute over what constitutes Australia's summit: some people climb Mount Kosciuszko, the highest point on the Australian mainland; others climb the more demanding Puncak Jaya, highest point of the Australian continental shelf. In 1986, Canadian Patrick Morrow became the first to complete the Seven Summits with Puncak Jaya. In 1996, Californian David D. Keaton became the first person to complete both versions of the Seven Summits as well as the 50 U.S. state highpoints. The first person to climb all of Europe's highpoints was Ginge Fullen in 1999. There were a few revisions of the high points in Europe e.g. Kosovo - Morgan Batt is the first to summit the revised list 2017. Fullen also appears to be the first person to climb the highpoint of every nation in Africa. Since then, a few dozen people have also completed the European highpoints. European highpoint climbers have their task complicated by 1) various definitions of what constitutes the European continent 2) emergence of new nations 3) debate over whether to count the highest points on the mainland of a nation, or the highpoints of islands belonging to it. Climbs to the tops of each state/province in Canada, Australia, and other countries have also been recorded. To date, no person is known to have reached the highest point in every country in the world. The highest point of Bhutan (Gangkhar Puensum) is closed to the public, and is probably the world's highest unclimbed mountain.https://www.atlasandboots.com/worlds-unclimbed-mountains/ Atlasandboots.com. Virgin Peaks: The World's Unclimbed Mountains. February 17, 2018. Retrieved August 28, 2019. Highpointing guidelines Rules for this pursuit are few, and ascents are generally defined by the individuals themselves. Highpointing has no formal governing body. The organizational body for state highpointing in the U.S. is The Highpointers Club. However, many Highpoint Guides and Books hold to these general principles: * Any route to the top - walking, climbing, driving an automobile, etc. - is considered a valid means of attaining the high point. Each individual must decide what constitutes good sport. Many will prefer reaching the high point under their own locomotion, or to climb a certain amount of vertical feet en route, but the means of ascent is a personal choice. * The goal is to attain the highest \\"natural point.\\" In other words, regardless of what man-made structures have been placed on top, the goal is to stand atop the highest \\"natural point.\\" * If the natural high point is covered with a structure and that structure is accessible, even on a limited basis, entering the structure and standing over the presumed high point is the goal. If the structure is completely and permanently inaccessible—e.g. a military base or private telecommunications tower - the goal is to reach the highest accessible natural point. *Some highpoints are open on certain dates only and the Club expects all members to abide by these dates. *If the highest point in a state, county, etc. is located along a boundary, they must be visited. The highest summit within an area, being lower, does not count under such circumstances. The most prominent example of this is found in the state of Connecticut, where the highest point is on the slope of a mountain whose summit is actually in Massachusetts. U.S. state and territory highpoints See also: List of U.S. states and territories by elevation Denali, highest point of Alaska and the United States The two most prolific highpointing organizations are The Highpointers Club, whose members aspire to reaching all of the U.S. state highpoints, and the County Highpointers Club, whose members are collectively attempting to reach the highest point in the 3,142 U.S. counties located in the 50 states and District of Columbia. (The County Highpointers Club is not attempting to reach the highest points of the 100 county-equivalents in the U.S. territories). U.S. state highpointers generally consider the recognized highpoints of the 50 U.S. states, but may also include the highpoints of the District of Columbia and the 5 major U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands).https://highpointers.org/us- highpoint-guide/ Highpointers.org.

Because of the difficulty of climbing Alaska's Denali, many people only attempt to reach the highpoints of the 48 contiguous states. In addition to reaching the highest point in each of the 50 U.S. states, some highpointers also ascend Fort Reno Park, the highest point in the District of Columbia, and/or Cerro de Punta, the highest mountain in Puerto Rico. Some also climb the highpoints of other U.S. territories like Mount Lamlam in Guam and Lata Mountain in American Samoa. Elevations range from 20,310 feet on Alaska's Denali to 345 feet on Florida's Britton Hill. Technically, the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands has the lowest elevation, with the highest elevation being 279 feet (85 meters) on Navassa Island.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/bq.html Navassa Island. CIA World Factbook. Retrieved August 28, 2019. See List of U.S. states and territories by elevation for more information. Difficulty of ascent varies considerably from state to state (or territory). About 20 of the states can be ascended by automobile. Many of the rest can be reached via an easy hike. Only 10 to 20 require serious effort, depending on an individual's fitness and skills. Denali is by far the most difficult, requiring serious training, thousands of dollars, about three weeks, and favorable weather conditions to summit. See and for more information on the relative difficulty of the various ascents. While most highpointers view highpointing as a hobby it is also seen a sport by many in the mountaineering community. In 1991 a team consisting of Pete Allard, Jim Grace, Shaun Lacher, David Sandway and Dennis Stewart, who called themselves \\"The Highpoint Hoppers,\\" set the first recognized record for climbing the highest point in each of the lower contiguous states in the fastest time. The team began on the summit of Mount Rainier in Washington at midnight on July 1 and finished on the summit of Gannett Peak in Wyoming on July 31 thus completing their goal of ascending all 48 state highpoints in one calendar month. Their time was 30 days, 10 hours and 52 minutes. For their effort, the Highpoint Hoppers got recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records. Fifteen years later, British climber Jake Meyer broke the speed record for climbing the lower 48 highpoints in 23 days, 19 hours and 31 minutes in 2006. The record stood until American siblings Josh and Lindsay Sanders broke the record in 19 days, 7 hours and 37 minutes in 2015  County highpoints  Pikes Peak, tallest mountain in El Paso County, Colorado County highpointing, unlike state highpointing, is most popular in the British Isles. There are several guides covering ascents of the counties of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. There are 48 counties in England, 33 in Scotland, 32 in Ireland, and 22 in Wales. Most of these \\"county tops\\" outside Scotland are non- technical walk-ups. Each nation in the British Isles has seen dozens of people complete their lists. Climbers have been confused in recent years by status changes in the various counties, both adding and subtracting highpoints, depending upon the criteria used. By contrast, in the United States, there are 3,242 counties, and no one has yet approached climbing all of them. Bob Packard is currently listed as the person with the most county highpoints completed, having ascended to the tops of all the counties of 29 states. Because of the large number of counties in the U.S., most county highpointers narrow the list by aspiring to climb only a certain subset of county highpoints. For instance, many county highpointers only ascend the highpoints of single (or perhaps maybe a few) states. Others may climb only the highest, most prominent, or most difficult county high points. Rhode Island, a low state with a handful of counties, has seen the most people climb all its counties, with 40 people listed. Several U.S. states and territories have not yet seen ascents of all their counties. The U.S. county highpointers' club rules, as described here, are slightly stricter than state highpoint rules. Many counties, especially flat and low-lying ones, have not been fully surveyed and thus have no single defined highest point, just multiple areas with the same highest contour line. In order to claim to have successfully climbed the county's highest point, then, it is necessary to visit all those areas, unless one can clearly be ruled out by line of sight from another one or by virtue of having been graded or excavated. Even if one area has an elevation indicated on the USGS map, the county highpointer must visit other areas within the same contour until and unless the maximum elevations are resolved by an official survey. For flat counties with multiple points, county highpointing is more akin to geocaching than peak bagging, since logically only one of the points is the highpoint, and the rest are not. In this case the number of virtual 'caches' is largely an artifact of the size of the contour interval (for a given area, the larger the contour interval, the more 'possible' highpoints there will be). For instance suppose the two highest points in a county are 101 feet and 106 feet above sea level, and that neither has a spot elevation on the map. If the region is mapped with 5-foot contours, there will be only 1 \\"highpoint\\". However, if the region is mapped with 10-foot contours, there will be two \\"highpoints\\", and county highpointers will be required to visit both points to claim the county.

It opened in 1969 and closed in 2016. The theater was named in honor of the original Ziegfeld Theatre (1927–1966) which was built by the impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.. History On December 17, 1969, a few hundred feet from the site of the original Ziegfeld Theatre, a new Ziegfeld opened as a single-screen movie house with the New York premiere of Marooned. It was the flagship of the Walter Reade movie theatre chain. Constructed by Emery Roth & Sons from designs by Irving Gershon it was built on part of the old theatre and was the first new theatre in the Times Square area since Radio City Music Hall was built in 1932. It was one of the last large-scale, single-screen movie palaces built in the United States. The gold and maroon interior was designed by John J. McNamara at a cost of $600,000. The theatre had 1,152 seats (825 seats in the orchestra section and 306 seats in the tiered rear section). It was often used for world premieres and big-event press screenings, such as the November 1977 opening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In 1987, Cineplex Odeon Corporation acquired the Walter Reade Organization and took over operation of the theatre. The theater underwent extensive renovations in the late 1990s. It was a centerpiece site during the 2008 New York Film Festival because of reconstruction work at Lincoln Center that year. During the 2000s, digital projection was installed. The theater became the largest single-screen cinema operating in New York. The screen was 20 feet tall and 52 feet wide, making it the largest non-IMAX screen in New York City. From 2013 until its closing, the Ziegfeld was managed by Bow Tie Cinemas, on behalf of Cablevision, which owned the theater. The theater was previously part of the Clearview Cinemas chain, which was owned by Cablevision, prior to the chain's sale to Bow Tie; the actual ownership of the Ziegfeld building was excluded from the sale. =Closing= On January 20, 2016 owners announced that the Ziegfeld would close \\"within a few weeks\\" due to dwindling attendance and revenue. Eight days later the Ziegfeld Theatre closed its doors to the public as a large single screen movie theater with a final showing of the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The theater underwent a major renovation and re-opened in October 2017 as a luxury event space called the Ziegfeld Ballroom.

It forms a central location in the Masters of the Universe toy/comic/animation universe and also appears in the 1987 live action adaptation. The concept is credited to Donald F. Glut. The toy set was invented by Roger Sweet. Castle Grayskull was a \\"major feature of Matell's line\\", and was \\"one of the most famous playsets of all time\\". In the storyline of the franchise, it is the target of numerous attacks by Skeletor, Hordak and the Snake Men, all of whom believe that the secrets inside will allow them to conquer Eternia and become the titular Masters of the Universe. Toyline Castle Grayskull was conceived as the central location for the battle between the forces of good and evil. The original playset was released in 1982, and all other depictions of the castle originate from it. It is a large hollow green castle, consisting of two halves connected by a hinge. The toy is designed to open for play and close for storage. A carrying handle is molded into the top of the castle. A large skull decorates the front, with a hinged \\"Jawbridge\\" allowing access to the interior, through the \\"mouth\\" opening. The interior has a throne room, elevator, and a trap door. Multiple accessories are also included - a ladder, removable flag pole, turret cannon, weapons rack with 9 weapons, and a \\"battle trainer\\" device. When the initial Mattel toy line was introduced in 1982, the He-Man and Skeletor figures each came with half of a plastic sword which could be joined into one \\"complete\\" sword, corresponding to the storyline in the included mini-comic. Together, the combined sword was used as a key to open the jawbridge to the Castle Grayskull playset. According to the original storyline, the Goddess (an early name for the Sorceress) had split the sword into two and scattered the pieces, in order to protect the castle and its source of universal power. The toy set was the centerpiece of the toy line, and sold more than 3.5 million units. An early concept sketch by Mark Taylor featured \\"the Dwell of Souls\\", an idea that evolved into Castle Grayskull; it featured a skull-shaped entrance. The original packaging art by Rudy Obrero showed Skeletor inside the jaw bridge; this was produced before the storyline was developed, when the castle was thought to belong to Skeletor. The original concept art and prototype show a large swamp surrounding the castle, which was going to be printed on a playmat that would be positioned beneath the playset. This moat playmat was not included with the finished toy, in order to keep costs down. Storyline origins The origin of Castle Grayskull was related in the read-along book \\"Castle Grayskull\\" Masters of the Universe: Castle Grayskull, published by Kid Stuff, 1983, as once being the beautiful \\"Hall of Wisdom,\\" the \\"center of Eternian culture and a storehouse of all knowledge of the universe.\\" The Hall was the meeting place of the Council of Elders. One day, the elders saw a vision of a beautiful woman dressed in snake armor (note that this description matches early versions of Teela AND the Sorceress, see for example,\\"He-Man and the Power Sword\\" early mini-comic, making an intended identity with the Sorceress very possible) who warned of future danger and also the coming of He-Man. The elders concentrated all of their power into a magical orb. The elders then magically transformed the Hall of Wisdom into Castle Grayskull in order to frighten away intruders and protect the orb. This was to have all taken place several centuries before the coming of He-Man. The Castle was then largely forgotten until Man-At-Arms eventually led Prince Adam to Castle Grayskull, where Prince Adam became He-Man using the Sword of Power. Filmation series In the original television series, Castle Grayskull is a legendary/mythical location situated on a pedestal of bones jutting out of an abyss in a barren plain just on the edge of the Evergreen Forest. It serves as home to the Sorceress and to the mysterious and rarely seen Spirit of Grayskull, as well as a place of refuge for He-Man and all those considered his friends. Its origins are unknown except for the fact that it was constructed to protect an unspecified source of power from those who would misuse it. It is a frequent target for the forces of evil. Although it is mostly viewed from the outside, there are a few notable internal locations: the Throne Room; Main Chamber (including the Walkway of the Elders); the Hall of He-Man; the Portal Chamber (in the skull top); a laboratory (basement); Mirror Room (basement); the Sorceress' den (where she studies and practices spells; in the right tower); and, the Sorceress' bed-chamber. In the episode \\"Double Trouble\\", an evil doppelganger of He-Man's friend Kol Darr also comes across the chamber that houses the Secrets of Castle Grayskull. It is a room with two doors, between which sits the Guardian, one of which houses the secrets, the other one is the only destruction. The castle is surrounded by a bottomless abyss, which doubles as a moat in at least one episode, and a Jawbridge (a drawbridge formed by the lower jaw of the castle's \\"mouth\\") is used to come across it. When Prince Adam transforms into He-Man, sparks shoot up from the abyss towards He-Man's sword. This phenomenon is seen in the episode \\"Into the Abyss\\", when Teela falls into the abyss and witnesses this spectacle from a unique vantage point. In the same episode, He-Man states that the abyss actually leads to the center of Eternia. There are a number of magical doors inside the castle, most of them in the Portal Chamber, that serve as portals to various locations on Eternia, including Snake Mountain, and at least one that leads to Etheria. 2002 series The castle's purpose and history are significantly expanded upon in 2002 series, as are the variety of locations shown in the castle. The most significant of the expansions made is the addition of a large Crystal Chamber, accessible only by a secret \\"door\\" in the floor of a secluded chamber. Within this chamber is the Orb of Power, within which lies the combined powers of the Elders. Prior to its bestowal upon Prince Adam, the Sword of Power was also stored in the depths of the Crystal Chamber. Other locations within the castle include the Throne Room (trophy room); a massive library (blue room); a room that houses an enormous, mystical mirror used to view both the past and present; an underground colosseum; a secret chamber devoted to King Grayskull; the area behind the eye sockets of the castle's facade; and, numerous corridors that are draped in illusions to confound invaders. Once made of white marble, and at the center of King Grayskull's bustling kingdom, the castle fell into a state of disrepair following a devastating battle with the forces of Hordak. Over countless years, the castle was almost entirely forgotten by the populace. Its true purpose, and the secrets within, are now known to only a very select few. Like the Filmation version, it is surrounded by a seemingly bottomless abyss and is backed by a sheer cliff. This abyss was revealed to have been created during the final confrontation between King Grayskull and Hordak. Live action movie In the 1987 live-action movie, Castle Grayskull is finally captured by Skeletor's forces. The first image of it seen is of its interior as Skeletor, victorious at last, makes the long march across the castle's Throne Room. The throne resides in the posterior section of the room just beyond the section's seemingly incomplete marble foundation which rests atop pillars and framework that extend from a deep abyss. This foundation is formed in such a way that there are four large holes of sizes that altogether occupy most of the floor's area leaving a few wide catwalk walkways. The large posterior section of the room is lined with several tall statues of elders along each side whereas the much thinner, less tall, anterior section of the room is an open hallway lined with columns along each side. Near the throne, Skeletor has trapped the Sorceress within an energy field, which, little by little, transfers her power to him. The castle serves as Skeletor's main base of operations throughout the movie. According to the film, it houses a giant circular portal called \\"the Great Eye of the Galaxy\\", which only opens when Eternia's moon reaches its zenith, granting whoever stands before it god-like power. It is never explicitly stated, though visuals strongly indicate, that for this to happen the Sword of Grayskull must be inserted into a small column near the portal. The opening narration implies that Castle Grayskull itself is at the center of the universe. In the film, the exterior of Castle Grayskull was designed by production designer William Stout. It was presented as a matte painting, and only appeared once, to reduce the cost of sets and models. King Grayskull In the 2002 remake of He-Man, it is revealed that Castle Grayskull was once home to King Grayskull, an ancestor of Prince Adam, who died defending his kingdom and Eternia as a whole from Hordak. Upon his death, King Grayskull transferred his power into his sword that now forms the basis of He-Man's power. His wife Veena became the first Sorceress, and his advisers became the Council of Elders. He also had an enormous green lion as a mount, bearing the same armor as Battle Cat, and is presumably where Battle Cat gains his powers.

For three years he self-released his earliest albums on CD-R, including \\"Rock Non Rock\\" and \\"Belligerent Super Vision\\", his first unreleased full-length. Then in 2005, Cock Rock Disco began releasing other artists including Duran Duran Duran, Drumcorps, Otto von Schirach, About, the Assdroids and Dev/Null. The label has currently (as of Nov 2009) 18 full-length releases, 15 12\\"-only releases and continues to release bi-monthly free MP3 only albums, of which there are currently 19 and growing fast. A free full-length Mp3 album was made available in Dec, 2005 and remains online and free to download. To date it has been downloaded over 70,000+ times. In April 2009 a new free compilation \\"Monsters of Cock Rock Disco\\" was released and features newcomers to the label Captain Ahab in addition to their normal roster of artists. To celebrate release of the \\"Monsters of CRD\\" the label hosted a tour of central Europe with Otto von Schirach, Duran Duran Duran, Nero's Day at Disneyland, and Forrest, as DJ Donna Summer. The tour lasted 2 weeks and stopped at 10 cities. There was a limited edition poster accompanying the tour that was sold out. Forrest also designs most of the visuals for Cock Rock Disco including the website, many of the album covers, and any social media presence. In 2015, Cock Rock Disco was re-launched with many of the label's previous releases becoming available as free mp3 downloads and continuing to release new music and videos.  Nightshifters  In 2008, Forrest began a new label that focused exclusively on club-friendly music called Nightshifters together with New York City Dj Jubilee. The label works mainly with a small group of musicians including AC Slater, Hostage, Rob Threezy, Proper Villains, Jubilee, Rampage, and Forrest himself as Dj Donna Summer. The label releases \\"EP\\" length releases of usually 4 original tracks and 2-4 remixes per release. To date (Nov 2009) the label has released 9 mp3-only releases, 3 Dj mixes, and a T-shirt. Remixers have included Jokers Of The Scene, Mikix the Cat, Angel Alanis, Scott Cooper, Luna-C, Grahmzilla, DreSkull, and Blatta & Inesha. Forrest currently makes all of the design work for Nightshifters.  Advanced D&D;  Forrest was also the host of \\"Advanced D&D; With Donna Summer\\" on independent freeform radio station WFMU, where he continued to use the name Donna Summer after dropping it in relation to his own recordings. The show is still archived on the main WFMU website above. Forrest says, \\"The show was primarily focused on unreleased new musicians. I tried to play as much CDR stuff as possible, and figure about 80% of each show was completely unreleased.\\" On his own web-forum he has maintained that he would like to continue with the show again in the future.  Network Awesome  Network Awesome is an online TV broadcasting outlet launched by electronic musician Jason Forrest and co-founder Greg Sadetsky on January 1, 2011. Network Awesome also includes a magazine with the goal of providing commentary and analysis of the featured content via daily articles. The magazine is syndicated by Huffington Post and DigBoston.  Wasted Festival  In 2005, Forrest co-founded the Wasted Festival to showcase breakcore musicians and related acts. The mini-festival began in co-operation with Club Transmediale, and ran at least ten events.

Will contests generally focus on the assertion that the testator lacked testamentary capacity, was operating under an insane delusion, or was subject to undue influence or fraud. A will may be challenged in its entirety or in part. Courts and legislation generally feel a strong obligation to uphold the final wishes of a testator, and, without compelling evidence to the contrary, \\"the law presumes that a will is valid and accurately reflects the wishes of the person who wrote it\\". A will may include an in terrorem clause, with language along the lines of \\"any person who contests this will shall forfeit his legacy\\", which operates to disinherit any person who challenges the validity of the will. Such no-contest clauses are permitted under the Uniform Probate Code, which most American states follow at least in part. However, since the clause is within the will itself, a successful challenge to the will renders the clause meaningless. Many states consider such clauses void as a matter of public policy or valid only if a will is contested without probable cause.Uniform Probate Code (UPC) § 2-517. Penalty Clause for Contest, replicated at § 3‑905. Penalty Clause for Contest. Both found at University of Pennsylvania Law School website page on Uniform Probate Code. Accessed October 5, 2009. This article mainly discusses American law and cases. Will contests are more common in the US States than in other countries. This prevalence of will contests in the US is partly because American law gives people a large degree of freedom in disposing of their property and also because \\"a number of incentives for suing exist in American law outside of the merits of the litigation itself\\".Ronald J. Scalise Jr., Undue Influence and the Law of Wills: A Comparative Analysis, 19 Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law 41, 99 (2008). Most other legal traditions enforce some type of forced heirship, requiring that a testator leave at least some assets to their family, particularly the spouse and children. Standing to contest will Typically, standing in the United States to contest the validity of a will is limited to two classes of persons: # Those who are named on the face of the will (any beneficiary); # Those who would inherit from the testator if the will was invalid For example, if Monica makes a will leaving $5,000 each to her husband, Chandler; her brother, Ross; her neighbor, Joey and her best friend, Rachel. Chandler tells Monica that he will divorce her if she does not disown Ross, which would humiliate her. Later, Ross tells Monica (untruthfully) that Chandler is having an affair with Phoebe, which Monica believes. Distraught, Monica rewrites her will, disowning both Chandler and Ross. The attorney who drafts the will accidentally writes the gift to Rachel as $500 instead of $5,000 and also accidentally leaves Joey out entirely. Under such facts: *Chandler can contest the will as the product of fraud in the inducement, because if the will is invalid, he will inherit Monica's property, as the surviving spouse. *Ross can contest the will as the product of Chandler's undue influence, as Ross will inherit Monica's property if Chandler's behavior disqualifies Chandler from inheriting (however, that many jurisdictions do not consider a threat of divorce to be undue influence). *Rachel has standing to contest the will, as she is named in the document, but she will not be permitted to submit any evidence as to the mistake because it is not an ambiguous term. Instead, she will have to sue Monica's lawyer for legal malpractice to recover the difference. *Finally, Joey is neither someone who stands to inherit from Monica nor named in the will and so is barred from contesting the will altogether. Grounds for contesting will Common grounds or reasons for contesting a will include lack of testamentary capacity, undue influence, insane delusion, fraud, duress, technical flaws and forgery. =Lack of testamentary capacity= Lack of testamentary capacity or disposing mind and memory claims are based on assertions that the testator lacked mental capacity when the will was drafted, and they are the most common types of testamentary challenges. Testamentary capacity in the United States typically requires that a testator has sufficient mental acuity to understand the amount and the nature of the property, the family members and the loved ones who would ordinarily receive such property by the will, and (c) how the will disposes of such property. Under this low standard for competence, one may possess testamentary capacity but still lack mental capacity to sign other contracts.In a Michigan case, the state Supreme Court decision read, \\"A man may believe himself to be the supreme ruler of the universe and nevertheless make a perfectly sensible disposition of his property, and the courts will sustain it when it appears that his mania did not dictate its provisions.\\" See Fraser v. Jennison, 3 N.W. 882, 900 (Mich. 1879)In a Nebraska case, the court ruled that \\"gross eccentricity, slovenliness in dress, peculiarities of speech and manner or ill health are not facts sufficient to disqualify a person from making a will.\\" See 'In re' Estate of Frazier, 131 Neb. 61, 73, 267 N.W. 181, 187 (1936). Furthermore, a testator with serious dementia may have \\"lucid periods\\" and then is capable of writing or modifying a will. Other nations like Germany may have more stringent requirements for writing a will. Lack of mental capacity or incompetence is typically proven by medical records, irrational conduct of the decedent, and the testimony of those who observed the decedent at the time the will was executed. Simply because an individual has a form of mental illness or disease, undergoes mental health treatment after repeated suicide attempts, or exhibits eccentric behavior, does not mean the person automatically lacks the requisite mental capacity to make a will. =Undue influence= Undue influence typically involves the accusation that a trusted friend, relative, or caregiver actively procured a new will that reflects that person's own desires rather than those of the testator. Such allegations are often closely linked to lack of mental capacity: someone of sound mind is unlikely to be swayed by undue influence, pressure, manipulation, etc. As it is required for invalidation of a will, undue influence must amount to \\"over-persuasion, duress, force, coercion, or artful or fraudulent contrivances to such a degree that there is destruction of the free agency and will power of the one making the will. Mere affection, kindness or attachment of one person for another may not of itself constitute undue influence.\\" For example, Florida law gives a list of the types of active procurement that will be considered in invalidating a will: presence of the beneficiary at the execution of the will; presence of the beneficiary on those occasions when the testator expressed a desire to make a will; recommendation by the beneficiary of an attorney to draw the will; knowledge of the contents of the will by the beneficiary prior to execution; giving of instructions on preparation of the will by the beneficiary to the attorney drawing the will; securing of witnesses to the will by the beneficiary; and safekeeping of the will by the beneficiary subsequent to execution. In most U.S. states, including Florida, if the challenger of a will is able to establish that it was actively procured, the burden of proof shifts to the person seeking to uphold the will to establish that the will is not the product of undue influence. However, undue influence is notoriously difficult to prove, and establishing the someone has the means, motive and inclination to exert undue influence is not enough to prove that the person in fact exerted such influence in a particular case.Core v. Core's Administrators, 124 S.E. 453 (Va. 1924). However, attorneys are often held to a higher standard and are suspect if they assist in drafting a will that names them as a beneficiary.In re Putnam's Will, 257 N.Y. 140 (1931) In many jurisdictions, a legal presumption of undue influence arises when there is a finding of a confidential (or fiduciary) relationship, the active procurement of the will by the beneficiary and a substantial benefit to that beneficiary, such as if a testator leaves property to the attorney who drew up the will. However, that is dependent on the circumstances of such a relationship and typically the burden is initially on the person contesting to show undue influence. Proving undue influence is difficult. In Australia, a challenger must show that the free will of the testator has been overborne by words and actions of the alleged wrong doer(s), to such an extent that the deceased’s freedom of testation has been taken away. =Insane delusion= Insane delusion is another form of incapacity in which someone executes a will while strongly holding a \\"fixed false belief without hypothesis, having no foundation in reality.\\"Hooper v. Stokes, 145 So. 855 (Fla. 1933). Other courts have expanded on this concept by adding that the fixed false belief must be persistently adhered to against all evidence and reason, and the irrational belief must have influenced the drafting or provisions of the will.In re Heaton's Will, 224 N.Y. 22 (1918) In Florida, one of the most-often cited court rulings on insane delusion is from 2006. In this case, the decedent executed a new will in 2005 in the hospital with severe pain and under the influence of a strong medication. She died the next day. The new will disinherited the caretaker and left the decedent's estate to several charities. The caretaker asserted that the decedent was suffering from an insane delusion at the time the will was executed and that she thus lacked testamentary capacity. The decedent's physicians testified regarding the medication that the decedent was taking and how it had changed her personality. A psychiatrist who saw the decedent opined that she was delusional when she stated that the caretaker had abandoned her and had killed her dog. To the contrary, witnesses and evidence supported the position that the caretaker visited the decedent in the hospital every day, and the caretaker gave credible testimony that she was continuing to care for the dog. Accordingly, the court set aside the will as invalid based upon insane delusion. =Duress= Duress involves some threat of physical harm or coercion upon the testator by the perpetrator that caused the execution of the will. =Fraud= There are four general elements of fraud: false representations of material facts to the testator; knowledge by the perpetrator that the representations are false; intent that the representations be acted upon and resulting injury. There are two primary types of fraud: fraud in the execution, (for example, the testator was told the will he signed was something other than a willKelly v. Settegast, 2 S.W. 870 (Tex. 1887)), and fraud in the inducement (for example, the testator is intentionally misled by a material fact that caused the testator to make a different devise from the one he would otherwise have made). =Technical flaws= A will contest may be based upon alleged failure to adhere to the legal formalities required in a particular jurisdiction. For example, some states require that wills must use specific terminology or jargon, must be notarized, must be witnessed by a certain number of persons, or witnessed by disinterested parties who are not relatives, inherit nothing in the will, and are not nominated as an executor. Additionally, the testator and witnesses must generally sign the will in each other's sight and physical presence. For example, in Utah, a will must be \\"signed by the testator or in the testator's name by some other individual in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction; and... signed by at least two individuals, each of whom signed within a reasonable time after he witnessed either the signing of the will... or [received] the testator's acknowledgment [that he or she actually signed the will].\\"Utah Code Annotated, Title 75 Chapter 2 Section 502 In a Pennsylvania case, the wills of a husband and wife were invalidated because they accidentally signed each other's wills. =Forgery= In some cases a will contests is based on allegations that the will is forged. Forgery can range from the fabrication of an entire document, including the signatures, to the insertion or modification of pages in an otherwise legitimate will. According to a 2009 Wall Street Journal article, \\"charges of forgery are more common than proven cases of it. They often originate with an adult child who, feeling short-changed in a parent's will, accuses a sibling of doctoring the document\\". Notable cases of forged wills include the \\"Mormon will\\" allegedly written by reclusive business tycoon Howard Hughes (1905-1976), and the Howland will forgery trial (1868) in which sophisticated mathematical analysis showed that the signature on a will was most likely forged. British physician Harold Shipman killed numerous elderly patients and was caught after forging one patient's will to benefit himself. =Legal inheritance rights= Some jurisdictions permit an election against the will by a widowed spouse or orphaned children. That is not a contest against the will itself (the validity of the will is irrelevant), but an alternate procedure established by statute to contest the disposition of property. In the United Kingdom, wills are often contested on the basis that a child of the deceased (or somebody treated as such) was bequeathed nothing or less than could reasonably be expected. Practicability In the United States, research finds that between 0.5% and 3% of wills are contested. Despite that small percentage, given the millions of American wills probated every year it means that a substantial number of will contests occur. As of the mid-1980ss, the most common reason for contesting a will is undue influence and/or supposed lack of testamentary capacity, accounting for about three quarters of will contests; another 15% of will contests are based on an alleged failure to adhere to required formalities in the disputed will; the remainder of contests involve accusations of fraud, insane delusion, etc.Schoenblum, Jeffery A. (1987). \\"Will Contests—An Empirical Study\\", 22 Real Prop Prob &Tr.; J. 607, 647–48 The vast majority of will contests are not successful,Miller, Robert K. (ed). Inheritance and Wealth in America, Springer Science & Business Media, 1998, p 188 in part because most states tend to assume that a properly-executed will is valid, and a testator possesses the requisite mental capacity to execute a will unless the contesting party can demonstrate the contrary position by clear and convincing evidence. Generally, proponents of a will must establish its validity by a preponderance of evidence, but those contesting a will must prevail by showing clear and convincing evidence, the latter requiring a much higher standard of proof. Contesting a will can be expensive. According to a Boston-area estate planning attorney quoted in Consumer Reports (March, 2012), \\"A typical will contest will cost $10,000 to $50,000, and that's a conservative estimate\\".Consumer Reports Money Adviser, \\"How to contest a will: Do you think you were cheated out of an inheritance? You might be able to challenge the will\\". March 2012, accessed 2015-02-25 Costs can increase even more if a will contest actually goes to trial, and the overall value of an estate can determine if a will contest is worth the expense. In some cases, the threat of a will contest is intended to both pressure the estate into avoiding the expense of a trial and forcing an out-of-court settlement more favorable to disgruntled heirs. However, those who make frivolous or groundless objections to a will may be forced to pay the costs for both sides in the court battle. Courts do not necessarily look to fairness during will contests, and a considerable portion of will contests are initiated by those who have no cause of action justifying a court case but are instead reacting to \\"hurt feelings\\" of disinheritance.Williams, Geoff (2013). \\"Disinheriting Someone Is Not Easy\\", Reuters 31 Jan 2013, accessed 2015-03-07 In other words, just because the provisions of a will may seem \\"unfair\\" does not mean that the will is invalid. Therefore, wills cannot be challenged simply because a beneficiary believes the inheritance or lack thereof is unfair. In the United States, the decedent generally has a legal right to dispose of property in any way that is legal. Consequences Depending on the grounds, the result of a will contest may be: # Invalidity of the entire will, resulting in an intestacy or reinstatement of an earlier will. # Invalidity of a clause or gift, requiring the court to apply principles of intestate succession, or to decide which beneficiary or charity receives the charitable bequest by using the equitable doctrine of cy pres. # Diminution of certain gifts and increase of other gifts to the widowed spouse or orphaned children, who would now get their elective share.

History Several theories have been woven and advanced to explain the origin of the now famous municipality of Dinas, which had been the cradle of Islamic Culture and civilization and the bulwark of anti-Hispanic colonization of the entire Baganian Peninsula in Zamboanga del Sur. According to ancient history which has been accepted and educated by the scions of the great grand Sultan Kudarat, a descendants of the renowned Shariff Kabungsuan of Maguindanao was that the name Dinas was taken from a Maguindanao tern Di Nas where \\"Di\\" means \\"Not\\" and \\"Nas\\" means \\"Bad Luck or Unlucky\\". Hence, the early settlers who migrated from the province of Cotabato found their new haven as not unlucky or \\"Di Nas\\" because the mouths of all rivers emptying into the coastlines are facing East which according to their belief is a sign of good luck. The most popular legend handed down to this generation is that Dinas got its name by coincidence as a result of communication gap between a native and foreigner. When the Spaniards came to our shores, there was already a little settlement in Dinas organized by the followers of Shariff Kabungsuan. Within the community, there was only one sari-sari store wherein household necessities being supplied by the Chinese traders, who frequently visited the place from Zamboanga City. One day, a group of Spaniards happened to visit the place as part of their Christianization campaign. They roamed around until they reached the only store within the settlement. They asked what the name of the place was. The store owner did not understand a single word from the Spaniards. He thought that the Spaniards were asking what he was selling because they were pointing at the piles of sardines inside the shelves. Immediately, the store owner replied, \\"Sardinas\\", the native word of sardines. The foreigner nodded convincingly, \\"Ah, Dinas\\" and the Spaniards thought that the name of the place is Dinas. This is how Dinas got its name.http://www.zamboangadelsur.gov.ph/city-municipalities/dinas Barangays Dinas is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.

Climate Demographics  Economy  Agriculture is the main economic activity as well as the number one source of livelihood of the people, although Dumalinao is a coastal town. The town is one of the major rice granaries of Zamboanga del Sur as 5,998 hectares of the land area is devoted to agricultural production. The crops planted on these lands include rice, corn, coconut, banana, and root crops. Corn, in particular, is the municipality's main agricultural crop. An estimated 2,837 hectares of the land are utilized for corn production, with an average of 30 ca-vans per hectare (or 8.5 million kilos annually). On top of that, Dumalinao's climate is very conducive for growing corn, so much so that farmers usually get to have two croppings of corn per year. An estimated value of Php 51 million comes from the annual production of corn.

According to the , it has a population of people. Geography Dumingag is the northernmost town of Zamboanga del Sur, and is located in the heartlands of the Zamboanga peninsula. It is north-west of the fertile Salug Valley and its land boundaries are the municipality of Sergio Osmeña, Sr. of Zamboanga del Norte in the north, the municipality of Mahayag in the east, the municipalities of Sominot and Midsalip in the south, and the municipality of Siayan in the west. Dumingag is classified as a 3rd class municipality and, as of the August 2007 census, has a population of about 46,039. Etymology Local stories said it is named after a noted Subanen chieftain, \\"Dumi\\" and his wife, \\"Ingag\\".Dumingag Official Website (retrieved: 8 April 2009) Another supposed origin of the name tells about the native fellow who was asked by a government agent as to what the name of the place was while watching a cockfight. After the game was over, the stranger inquired about the name of the place. The native curtly replied: \\"Duminag!\\" meaning \\"I won\\". The government agent misheard the word. Instead of \\"Duminag\\", he wrote down \\"Dumingag\\". The authenticity of these stories, however, is questionable since there has never been a single piece of evidence or record that Dumi and Ingag had ever actually existed. The first non-Subanen settlers of Dumingag were from the Ilo-ilo town of Dumangas the Decolongon Family who cultivated town center area. According to more convincing sources, the earliest settlers arrived in Dumingag with renewed optimism after World War II and, starting their lives anew, they hailed the place as \\"Little Dumangas\\". Hence, this soon developed into the current name \\"Dumingag\\". History = First inhabitants = The first inhabitants of Dumingag were the Subanens who initially came from the coastal areas of the province and the neighboring province of Misamis Occidental. Prior to that, the place was once a vast expanse of jungle and marshland. =Establishment as a municipality = Originally, Dumingag was a barrio, and was part of the municipality of Molave. It was created in 1950 and the first barrio lieutenant back then was Jose Montuerto. On December 27, 1957, by virtue of Executive Order No. 283 issued by President Carlos P. Garcia, Dumingag finally became a municipality. Ever since it acquired its municipality status, a total of five people have handled the position of municipal mayor. They are Isidoro Y. Real, Sr (1957-1978), Julian C. Kho (1978-1986), Domeciano Y. Real (1986-1998), Edgardo J. Jamero (1998-2007), and Nacianceno M. Pacalioga, Jr., who's currently the mayor now. Of all the mayors who served the position, Isidro Y. Real, Sr. is widely considered to be the municipality's father and builder, him being the first mayor and the one who has served the longest. = Matial law era = The 1970s brought a period of numerous concurrent conflicts on the island of Mindanao, including Dumingag and Zamboanga del Sur.The Bangsamoro Struggle for Self-Determintation: A Case Study This included land dispute conflicts arising from the influx of settlers from Luzon and Visayas,See \\"History of the Philippines: From Indios Bravos to Filipinos\\" By Luis H. Francia Link to page in the referenced bookFor an in- depth survey of indigenous peoples and forced land seizures in the Philippines, see Cultural Survival Quarterly. and from the Marcos administration’s encouragement of militia groups such as the Ilaga.The Bangsamoro Struggle for Self-Determintation: A Case Study News of the 1968 Jabidah massacre ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements. Additionally, an economic crisis in late 1969, violent crackdowns on student protests in 1970, and 1971, and eventually the declaration of Martial Law all led to the radicalization of many students. Many of them left schools in Manila and joined New People's Army units in their home provinces, bringing a Communist rebellion in the Philippines to Mindanao for the first time. Dumingag became the site of a significant event during this period on February 12, 1982. Members of the Ilaga militia killed 12 persons in Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur, allegedly to avenge the death of their leader, who they believed had been killed by the NPA. = Recent history = Dumingag is slowly carving its name as one of the most rapidly improving municipalities of the whole region. It has been getting awards and citations in different fields, local and national. It is fast heading to progress and rapid development.

According to the , it has a population of people. History In the early years the lands of which is now Josefina was part of the Municipality of Aurora. In later years, Molave separated from Aurora and became a town; at that time Tambulig and the area now within the jurisdiction of the present municipality were still part of the former. Some years later Tambulig became independent and was recognized as a township with the land of Josefina still tagged as part of its territories. During this time the first Visayan settlers came to live in the area. These settlers came from Tudela, Misamis Occidental, a barrio part of Tambulig was established and was named Bagong Tudela. Some years passed and the Paredes family, one of the first settlers, was able to acquire properties there and named it \\"Salug Estate\\". A member of the family was a rubber technologist at that time and worked in Borneo. He brought along his lessons and expertise and together with the locals, \\"the Subanen\\", planted his land with Rubber Trees. By then the Rubber Technologist, Nicholas Paredes, coined the name \\"New Town\\" for the new rubber plantation. With the rubber plantation, the place was then locally called as \\"Gumahan\\". This became a new trading center and small businesses came bustling. With the increased activity in this new location it was then christened as \\"Upper Bagong Tudela\\". This eventually became the center of the new community. In the early 1970s, the people of Gumahan and its outlying barrios made a move, through the leadership of Nicholas Paredes, to create a town. They were able to submit the proposal to congress, through the sponsorship of then Cong. Cerilles, and it passed the 2nd congressional reading. When scheduled for the 3rd and final congressional reading, Martial Law was declared dissolving the Congress. On November 11, 1978, by virtue of Presidential Decree 1240, 13 barangays of Tambulig were separated and formed into the independent municipality Josefina. During this time Nicholas Paredes (who was the point person of the township proposal) stood as the first Mayor (appointed). Mayor Paredes donated the land where now stands the Market Area, the school, the Municipal Hall and the Catholic Church. The town center is also located within the properties of the Paredes family. Josefina was named after the mother of Congressman Cerilles, who was a known educator in Zamboanga Del Sur. As to this day Josefina is still commonly known as \\"Gumahan\\".

His feast day is commemorated on 11 October in the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church according to their respective calendars (Gregorian or Church Julian) with additional feast days on 1st or 14 August in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Introduction  A lot of what is known of Cainnech comes from legend. However, he is documented by Saint Adomnán (also known as Eunan), the ninth abbot of Iona who died in 704. Adomnán was a hagiographer and his greatest work Vita Columbae or Life of St. Columba contains references to Cainnech.Adamnan, \\"Life of St. Columba\\", Medieval sourcebook, Fordham UniversityBaring-Gould, S. and Fisher, John, The Lives of the British Saints, Vol.II, p.56, Charles J. Clark, London, 1908  Cainnech's background  Statue at St. Canice's Catholic Church, Kilkenny Cainnech was born in 515 or 516, at Glengiven, near Dungiven in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. His full name was Cainnech moccu Dalánn.Sharpe, Richard, Adomnán of Iona: Life of Saint Columba, pp. 262-263\\\\. Moccu is not a patronymic but rather the name of a kin group, in this case the Corcu Dalánn, in later sources, when it was no longer current, moccu was sometimes mistakenly read as a patronymic such as mac or mac h-ui; see Charles-Edwards, T. M., Early Christian Ireland, pp. 96-100. Cainnech's father Lughadh Leithdhearg was descended from the CorcoDalann or Ui Dalainn, a tribe whose ancestor, Dalann, is traced back to Fergus (King of Ulster), son of Ross, son of Rudhraighe. The Corco-Dalann were from an island referred to as \\"Insula Nuligi\\", and is usually identified with Inis-Doimhle or Inis-Uladh, which is now the Little Island, in the River Suir, south-east of Waterford. Lughadh was a distinguished bard, a highly trained, professional itinerant poet. Lughadh settled at Glengiven, in what is now County Londonderry. Lughadh ended up under the favour and protection of the chief of Cianachta, and became the tutor of the chieftain's son, Geal Breagach.\\"St Canice of Aghaboe\\", The Parish Church of St George, Belfast Cainnech's mother was called Maul or Mella. She attained an eminent degree of sanctity. The church of Thompleamoul or Capella Sanctae Maulae seu Mellae, beside Kilkenny city, was dedicated to God under her invocation.  Early life  St. Finnian imparting his blessing to the Twelve Apostles of Ireland In early Christian Ireland the druid tradition collapsed, with the spread of the new faith. The study of Latin and Christian theology flourished in monasteries. Cainnech spent his early years watching his chieftain's flocks. In 543 Cainnech became a pupil at Finnian's monastic school at Clonard. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish Christianity studied at the Clonard monastery. Twelve students who studied under St. Finian became known as the Twelve Apostles of Ireland, Cainnech was one of these. It was at Clonard that Cainnech became a friend and companion of St Colmcille (Columba). In 544 he studied under St. Mobhi at the school of Glasnevin, with Kieran of Clonmacnoise and St. Comgall of Bangor. When plague scattered that community, he went to Saint Cadoc's monastery of Llancarfan in Glamorganshire in Wales, where he was ordained a priest in 545.Duffy, Patrick. \\"St. Canice of Dungiven\\", Catholic Ireland.net He left for Rome to obtain the blessing of the reigning pontiff. In 550 he had returned to Glengiven, where he converted his foster-brother, Geal-Breagach, who afterwards assisted him in founding Drumachose, in nearby Limavady.  Scotland  In 565 Cainnech joined Columba in Scotland, where he is known as St. Kenneth. Adamnan tells of the arrival of Cainnech, on Iona. St. Columba had a prophecy of a \\"certain holy and excellent man, who will arrive here among us before evening.\\" According to Adamnan, God provided Cainnech with a safe and calm crossing, even though the sea was perilous and stormy that day. St. Columba received him that evening with all honour and hospitality. Cainnech built a church in the place now known as Saint Andrews. He built monastic cells on the island of Ibdon, possibly South Uist, and Eninis, an oratory called Lagan-Kenny on the shores of Loch Laggan (the remains of which are marked on the OS map), and a monastery in Fife on the banks of the Eden. The saint may have been an important saint in converting South Uist to Christianity. Cainnech's name is still recalled in the ruins of an ancient church, Kil-Chainnech on Tiree, in a burial ground, Kil-Chainnech, in Iona and Inch Kenneth off Mull.\\"Kilchenzie's Saint, Kenneth (Cainnech) Of Aghaboe, Patron of The Shipwrecked\\", Kintyre on Record Return to Ireland Cainnech spent a good deal of his time in County Meath and Ossory in what is now County Laois. In Ossory he had a good repute with the king, Colmann son of Feradach. Colman gave him grants of land including Aghaboe (\\"the field of the Ox\\") which became his principal monastery. Aghaboe grew in importance, and in the 7th century sent St. Feargal as a missionary to the church of Salzburg, Austria. Aghaboe was for a time the site of the bishop's see until under Norman influence in the twelfth century the see transferred from Aghaboe to Kilkenny. In 1346 Diarmaid Mac Giollaphádraig burned the town of Aghaboe, and completely destroyed Cainnech's shrine along with his relics. St. Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny. Kilkenny (Irish: Cill Chainnigh \\"The Church of Cainnech\\") was originally the name of a church erected by or dedicated to Cainnech, but was afterwards extended to the townland and parish.. Kilkenny was one of the last parts of Ireland to be converted to Christianity. Tradition asserts that in 597, Cainnech led a Christian force to Kilkenny to eliminate the last bastion of Druidic rule in Ireland. The last Archdruid of Ireland had retired with his Council to a mound in Kilkenny for safety. Cainnech led an army there and overcame them. He founded a monastery near what is now the Church of Ireland's St. Canice's Cathedral. He died and was interred at Abbey of Aghaboe in 599/600.  Chain of Cainnech  In his old age Cainnech retired to an island in what was once Loch Cree, and wrote a commentary on all four Gospels. This became known as Glass Kinnich (Glas- Chainnigh) or the Chain of Cainnech. This was long preserved in his church and became a continuous commentary in the Middle Ages. Patronage Cainnech is the patron of Aghaboe and together with St. Ciarán of Saigir, is one of the patrons of Kilkenny and the historic kingdom of Osraige.Smith, William, and Wace, Henry.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling from 1993 to 1996 under the ring name Dave Sullivan, where he played the dyslexic brother of Kevin Sullivan. Early life and football career Dannenhauer attended Westside High School, where both he and his brother wrestled. He and his brother attended the University of Nebraska Omaha, where they played football for the Omaha Mavericks. Dannenhauer went on to play for the short-lived United States Football League before ending his playing career. He went on to serve as an assistant coach for the Mavericks before joining Washburn University as offensive coordinator for the Washburn Ichabods. In 1989, Dannehauer decided to become a wrestler after meeting Harley Race at a high school tournament. He trained under Len Denton and debuted later that year. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1989–1993)= Danenhauer started wrestling in 1989 in the National Wrestling Alliance territory Pacific Northwest Wrestling under the ring name \\"The Equalizer\\". He teamed with The Grappler as \\"The Wrecking Crew\\", with the duo winning the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on two occasions. In 1990, he would tour on and off with Catch Wrestling Association for two years under the name \\"The Barbarian\\". In 1991, he briefly wrestled in New Japan Pro Wrestling, most notably losing a match to Scott Norton on March 21 at the Tokyo Dome. In 1992, Danenhauer left PNW for the Global Wrestling Federation where he wrestled as \\"Captain Ron\\". He would tour the United Kingdom under the name \\"American Hawkwind.\\" =World Championship Wrestling (1993–1996)= In 1993, Danenhauer joined World Championship Wrestling as The Equalizer, and teamed briefly with Rick Rude as his tag team partner/bodyguard. They feuded with Dustin Rhodes and Road Warrior Hawk. He also teamed with Paul Orndorff. His biggest push started in the summer of 1994 when he became \\"Dave Sullivan\\" the dyslexic brother of Kevin Sullivan who regularly mispronounced his own forename as \\"Evad\\". He was being picked on by The Nasty Boys and brought Kevin in to help him against them. He was injured by them, so Kevin Sullivan brought in Cactus Jack to help them out. After Kevin and Jack took care of The Nasty Boys, they split up, and Jack left. Hulk Hogan made his WCW debut that summer, and Sullivan became his biggest fan. Kevin hated Hogan, and problems started brewing. Sullivan started teaming with Hogan and Sting against Ric Flair and his henchmen, and Kevin soon turned on Dave, which started a feud that went into 1995. After his feud with Kevin ended, Dave fell in love with Kimberly, the valet of Diamond Dallas Page. Page took offense to this and started a feud with Dave that lasted all summer. During this feud, Dave gave Kimberly presents, which infuriated Page even more. Sullivan eventually lost the feud and moved on. Sullivan's next feud was with Big Bubba Rogers. Sullivan had a pet rabbit that he brought to ringside with him, and Bubba was allergic to rabbits. Bubba started wearing a surgical mask to keep from inhaling the allergins, but Sullivan would always pull it off and get the victory. Danenhauer left WCW in early 1996 after participating in the first World War 3 event. Retirement and football coaching career Danenhauer retired from professional wrestling in 2001 due to the cumulative impact of injuries sustained in his football and wrestling careers. He relocated to Bentonville, Arkansas, where he worked for Wal-Mart as a fitness trainer. In 2003, he began working as offensive coordinator for the Vikings football team of Dana College in Blair, Nebraska. He was later appointed athletics director. On July 10,2020, Danenhauer was announced as the 2nd Inductee into the Nebraska Pro Wrestling Hall Of Fame Class of 2020 Championships and accomplishments *Empire Wrestling Association **EWA North American Championship (1 time) *NWA Pacific Northwest Wrestling **NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Champion (2 times) – with The Grappler *Professional Wrestling Federation **PWF Eastern States Championship (1 time) **PWF Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Baby Huey (1) and George South (1) *Southern States Wrestling **SSW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *United States Wrestling Federation **USWF Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with John Bradshaw *Wrestling Observer Newsletter **Worst Gimmick (1994) **Worst Wrestler (1993, 1994) References External links * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:Dana Vikings athletic directors Category:Dana Vikings football coaches Category:Dyslexia in fiction Category:Nebraska–Omaha Mavericks football players Category:Professional wrestlers from Nebraska Category:Sportspeople from Omaha, Nebraska Category:Washburn Ichabods football coaches Category:Washington Federals/Orlando Renegades players ","title":"Dave Sullivan (wrestler)"},{"id":"2144171","text":"GNOME Terminal is a terminal emulator for the GNOME desktop environment written by Havoc Pennington and others. Terminal emulators allow users to access a UNIX shell while remaining on their graphical desktop. Features GNOME Terminal ('gnome-terminal' from the command line or GNOME's Alt-F2 launcher) emulates the xterm terminal emulator and provides some of the same features. =Profiles= GNOME Terminal supports multiple profiles. A user can create multiple profiles for his or her account. Users can then set configuration options on a per-profile basis and assign a name to each profile. The available configuration options range from different fonts, different colors, emission of the terminal bell, the behavior of scrolling, and how the terminal handles compatibility with the backspace and delete key. When GNOME Terminal starts, it can be configured to launch the user's default shell or run a custom command. These options can be configured per profile, allowing users to execute different commands depending on the profile. For example, some users may have one profile to launch their default shell, another profile that connects to another computer remotely through SSH, and finally a profile that opens a GNU Screen session. =Compatibility= GNOME Terminal supports a couple of different compatibility options for interfacing with older software that depends on varying keyboard-to-ASCII assignments. In computing, there has been ambiguity between the backspace key and delete key. When the user presses the backspace key, the computer can either delete the character before the cursor, or the character at the cursor, which introduces this ambiguity (see ASCII). GNOME Terminal allows the user specify which control character or escape sequence the delete and the backspace keys should generate. Users can specify this option on a per-profile basis. =Colored text= Colored texts in GNOME Terminal 3 Colored text is available in GNOME Terminal, although users may turn this feature off. GNOME Terminal supports a basic set of 16 colors, which the user can choose. Furthermore, GNOME Terminal has support for a palette of 256 colors by default. Some programs, such as vim, can use that many colors. As of version 3.12, it also supports RGB direct true colors. =Background= GNOME Terminal allows changing background settings on per profile basis. Available options are solid color. Older versions also included transparent background option, which allowed to see windows beneath terminal window. Although this option was dropped shortly after 3.6 release, several Linux distributions including Ubuntu and Fedora patch their packages of GNOME Terminal to re-enable this feature. =Mouse events= Although GNOME Terminal is primarily a command-line interface and uses the keyboard for most input, GNOME Terminal has limited support for mouse events. GNOME Terminal can capture mouse scrolls and both left and right clicks. Presently, it cannot detect the location of the mouse, but some terminal applications can utilize the mouse events, such as aptitude or vim. At this time, there is no support for touch based gestures. =Text rewrapping on resizing= Since version 3.12 (incorporating version 0.35 of the VTE widget), GNOME Terminal supports text re-wrapping on re-sizing (long lines of text already printed to the terminal's standard out are reflowed to fit the new line width when the dimensions of the terminal window are resized). This behaviour is similar to that of GNU Screen and other curses-based applications such as less. =URL detection= GNOME Terminal parses the output and automatically detects snippets of text that appear to be URLs or email addresses. When a user points to a URL, the text is automatically underlined, indicating that the user may click. Upon clicking, the appropriate application will open to access that resource. =Tabs= Multiple terminal sessions may be organized within single GNOME Terminal window as tabs. Switching between active session is possible either by using keyboard shortcuts or by using tab bar – a row of buttons, each corresponding to active session, that appears on top of GNOME Terminal window when multiple tabs are used. Similar to the profile feature, each tab can be assigned a name. =Safe quit= Quit warning in GNOME Terminal 3.32 In recent versions, when the user attempts to quit the entire graphical application, GNOME Terminal will prompt the user with a dialog box to confirm if the user truly wants to exit GNOME Terminal. This feature is intended to reduce the risk of accidentally closing a terminal window (e.g., by clicking the window's close button) with a job still running. If a job is running and the user closes the window, the job will quit and the user will have to restart the job if exiting was an accident. This feature is only present when the user closes the application through the graphical interface. If the user attempts to quit with the exit shell command, it is the responsibility of the user's shell to confirm the exit. Although not a GNOME Terminal feature, some shells, e.g. tcsh and bash, offer similar functionality and will notify the user that there are stopped jobs. Development GNOME Terminal is largely based on the VTE widget (which replaced the older zvt widget). VTE, part of the GNOME project, has widgets that implement a fully functional terminal emulator. GNOME Terminal and VTE are both written in C. VTE is a library (libvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for GTK, and a minimal sample application (vte) using that. Vte is mainly used in gnome- terminal, but can also be used to embed a console/terminal in games, editors, IDEs, etc. The VTE library provides a terminal emulator widget VteTerminal for applications using the GTK toolkit. It also provides the VtePTY object containing functions for starting a new process on a new pseudo-terminal and for manipulating pseudo-terminals. At least GNOME terminal, XFCE terminal, ROX terminal, evilvte, guake, sakura, terminator and vala-terminal rely on vte.

The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Roy Huggins and John Pogue. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture The Fugitive, which in turn was based on the television series of the same name, created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of Dr. Richard Kimble, portrayed by Harrison Ford in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard, once again played by Tommy Lee Jones. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by Wesley Snipes, who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features Robert Downey Jr., Joe Pantoliano, Daniel Roebuck, Tom Wood, and LaTanya Richardson, several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film. The film was a co-production between Warner Bros. Pictures and Kopelson Entertainment. The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. U.S. Marshals premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998. Plot Two Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents are killed while trying to intercept a briefcase exchange taking place in a United Nations parking garage. The murders are caught on a security camera, but the criminal escapes with top secret information. Months later, tow truck driver Mark Warren is arrested for an illegal weapons possession charge following a vehicular collision in Chicago. Through a fingerprint check, the police determine that he is actually federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a homicide. That night, Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, who is escorting prisoners unrelated to Roberts' case. Roberts thwarts an assassination attempt by a Chinese prisoner with an improvised firearm, but the bullet blows a window that depressurizes the cabin, killing the prisoner and another marshal. The pilots attempt an emergency landing but the damaged plane crashes in a river in Southern Indiana. With the plane sinking, Gerard assists in rescuing fellow marshals and officers while they retrieve the surviving prisoners, but discovers Roberts has escaped. Eight hours later, DSS Special Agent John Royce is assigned to join Gerard's team and other officers to hunt Roberts, much to Gerard's reluctance to his potential in assistance. Roberts flees to New York City, after escaping a near death encounter with law enforcement, with Gerard and his team cornering him in a swampland in Kentucky. Arriving in New York days later, he secures money, weapons and fake identification from a former fellow US Marine of Force Recon. Roberts begins conducting surveillance on a Chinese diplomat named Xiang Chen. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux as well as the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, whom the Marshals find murdered by Chen. Gerard and his colleagues manage to access surveillance footage of the murders in the parking garage and realize that Roberts acted in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus he wouldn't have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as was earlier claimed. Confronted with the evidence, DSS Director Bertram Lamb admits to Gerard and his senior supervisor that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former CIA Special Activities Division operative and a former Force Recon Marine, that seemingly went rogue during an investigation to uncover a mole within the U.S. State Department that had been selling covert secrets to China. Chen was the contact delivering the money to Sheridan for the information and when DSS agents tried to apprehend him, Sheridan killed them in self-defense and fled the scene. Eventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he meets with, and threatens to expose, DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows as one of the conspirators who framed him. Chen tries to assassinate Sheridan as he leaves the cemetery, but inadvertently kills Barrows instead. Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Deputy Marshal Noah Newman. Meanwhile, Chen is caught and detained by Deputy Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs. At the senior care facility, Newman overhears a physical struggle and walks into a room where he witnesses Royce holding Sheridan at gunpoint. Royce suddenly shoots Newman with his gun and later lies to his associates, claiming Sheridan shot Newman. Sheridan escapes by swinging from the building onto the roof of a passing train. Newman dies of his gunshot wounds en route to the hospital. After retrieving fingerprints from an abandoned vehicle at a marine loading dock, Gerard tracks down Sheridan on a freighter ship bound for Canada. During a scuffle between Sheridan and Gerard aboard the vessel, Royce shoots Sheridan, injuring him. Sheridan is later taken into custody. Gerard begins to suspect Royce may be the mole when he notices the firearm that shot Newman had its serial number filed off (in an attempt to hide it), was actually Royce's own gun earlier. Left alone to guard Sheridan's hospital room, Royce wakes Sheridan up to murder him, but Gerard steps in, confronts and kills Royce first. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped as he is exonerated and released. Gerard and his team depart to honor Newman's legacy.

Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 25% based on reviews from 36 critics, with an average score of 4.93 out of 10.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Barbara Shulgasser, writing in The San Francisco Examiner, commented in positive sentiment about the acting, saying, \\"The film's pacing is unimpeachable and good performances are delivered by Jones, Snipes, Irene Jacob as Sheridan's loyal girlfriend and, for brief moments, Kate Nelligan as Gerard's tough but lovable boss.\\"Shulgasser, Barbara (6 March 1998).

In a mixed to negative review, Russell Smith of The Austin Chronicle bluntly deduced that, \\"Unlike Kimble, whose innocence and decency are known from the beginning in The Fugitive, Sheridan is a total cipher to both Gerard and the audience until deep into this two-hours-plus film.

The film however, was not without its detractors. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert, giving the film two and a half stars out of four, observed, \\"I didn't expect U.S. Marshals to be the equal of The Fugitive, and it isn't. But I hoped it would approach the taut tension of the 1993 film, and it doesn't. It has extra scenes, needless characters, an aimless plot and a solution that the hero seems to keep learning and then forgetting.\\" In a primarily negative review, Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, called the film \\"a bad idea to begin with.\\" He noted his confusion with the plot, remarking, \\"the movie tells us from the beginning that the fugitive is not quite innocent. He killed two fellow agents in self-defense. All this does is muddy the moral waters, making us queasy about the one guy we like. At no point is there ever a compelling reason to keep watching.\\"LaSalle, Mick (6 March 1998). 'Marshals' Way Off The Mark / 'Fugitive' formula fails Jones, Snipes. San Francisco Chronicle. Retrieved 2012-12-16. Describing a mild negative opinion, James Berardinelli of ReelViews professed Marshal Gerard as exhibiting \\"only a token resemblance to the character who doggedly pursued Kimball in The Fugitive. As re-invented here, Gerard is a generic action hero; most of the quirks that made him interesting (and that earned Jones an Oscar) are absent. With a few minor re-writes, John McClane from the Die Hard movies could have been plugged into this role.\\"Berardinelli, James (6 March 1998). U.S. Marshals. ReelViews. Retrieved 2012-12-16. Dissatisfied with the film's quality, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader said that it was \\"Not so much a sequel to The Fugitive as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting—Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar-winning inflections, better-than- average direction—is nowhere in evidence.\\"Rosenbaum, Jonathan (March 1998). U.S. Marshals. Chicago Reader. Retrieved 2012-12-16. Stephen Hunter, writing for The Washington Post, reasoned, \\"It turns out to be one of those lame double-agent things where everybody's working for everybody else, the security of Taiwan (Taiwan!) is at stake, and it never quite lurches into clarity or acquires any real emotional punch. I didn't think the end of The Fugitive was so great either: Who wants to watch doctors fistfight on a roof?

Film critic Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide was not consumed with the nature of the subject matter, declaring, \\"To every hit there is a season, and a time for every sequel under heaven — no matter what narrative contortions it takes.\\" She later surmised, \\"The minute Gerard mocks Royce's 'nickel-plated sissy pistol,' it's clear they're headed for a cathartic showdown, and anyone who can't see which member of Gerard's merry band might as well be wearing a 'Dead Meat Walking' T-shirt really shouldn't be allowed to operate complicated machinery.\\"McDonagh, Maitland (March 1998).

It is located in Muktinath Valley at the foot of the Thorong La mountain pass in Mustang, Nepal. It is one of the world's highest temples (altitude 3,800 m). The site is close to the village of Ranipauwa, which is sometimes mistakenly called Muktinath. Within Hinduism, it is known as Mukti Kshetra, which literally means the 'place of liberation' (moksh). This temple is considered to be 106th among the available 108 Divya Desam (premium temples) considered sacred by the Sri Vaishnava sect. Its ancient name in Sri Vaishnava literature was in 10 th CE (Common Era - means after 0 year ) while Buddhism was in 568 BCE (Before Common Era - Before 0 year ), origin, is Thiru Saligramam. This houses the Saligram shila, considered to be the naturally available form of Sriman . Buddhists call it Chumig Gyatsa, which in Tibetan means \\"Hundred Waters\\". For Tibetan Buddhists, Muktinath is an important place of dakinis, goddesses known as Sky Dancers, and one of the 24 Tantric places. They understand the murti to be a manifestation of Avalokiteśvara, who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas. Design The central shrine of Sri Muktinath is considered by Hindu Vaishnavas to be one of the eight most-sacred shrines, known as Svayam Vyakta Ksetras. The others are Srirangam, Srimushnam, Tirupati, Naimisharanya, Thotadri, Pushkar and Badrinath. The temple is small. The murti is gold and the size of a man. The prakaram (outer courtyard) has 108 bull faces through which water is poured. The sacred water that flows in 108 pipes around the temple complex denotes the sacred Pushkarini waters (Temple Tanks) from the 108 Sri Vaishnava Divya Desams, where devotees take their sacred bath even in freezing temperatures.  Rites  Worship is conducted by Buddhists, with a Buddhist monk present. A local nun manages the pujas (prayer rituals) in the temple. Pilgrims are expected to offer a prasad (religious offering of food) to the deity. Shakti Peetha The Muktinath Temple is considered to be a Shakti Peetha for a yatra. It is one of the 108 Siddhpeeth and is named Mahadevi [Devibhagwat 7.14]. Shakti Peethas are sacred abodes of Shakti (primordial cosmic energy), formed by the falling body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it as he wandered. 51 Shakti Peethas are revered by Shaktism, connecting them to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit. Each Shakti Peetha has a Shakti shrine and a Bhairav shrine in its temple. The Shakti of Muktinath is addressed as \\"Gandaki Chandi\\", and the Bhairava as \\"Chakrapani\\". Sati Devi's temple on the forehead is believed to have fallen there. Legend The Tibetan Buddhist tradition states that Guru Rinpoche, also known as Padmasambhava, the founder of Tibetan Buddhism, meditated at Muktinath on his way to Tibet. This temple is praised by many saints of the Hindu tradition. Scripts narrating the temple's importance are available in Vishnu Purana with the Gandaki Mahathmya. The waterway downstream from Muktinath along Kali Gandaki is the source of the Silas or Shaligrams that are required to establish a temple of Vishnu. It is considered to be one of the holiest places of pilgrimage for Hindus and Buddhists. It has 108 water springs, a number that carries great significance in Hindu philosophy. As an example of the mystery surrounding the number 108, Hindu astrology mentions 12 zodiacs (or Rashi) and 9 planets (or Graha), giving a total of 108 combinations. 27 lunar mansions (or Nakshatras) are divided into four quarters (or Padas) each giving a combination of 108 Padas in total. Sri Murthy Mahatmyam Hindu and Buddhist traditions claim this site to be the only place on Earth to host all five elements (fire, water, sky, earth and air) from which all material things in the universe are made. The riverbed of the Gandaki river has Shaligram stones that are used to worship Lord Vishnu. According to Sri Vaishnava philosophy, it is considered to be one of the most- sacred places of worship of Lord Vishnu, praised by Thirumangai Alwar in the compilation of Nalayira Divya Prabandha 10 Pasurams in Mudal pathu Iyndham thirumozhi. It is said that one has to be gifted to get the darśan (divine presence). Lord Sri Vishnu murthi and Goddess Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi are believed to give Jeevan Mukthi, hence it is called Mukthinath. Sri Vaishnavic reference A small river on the way to Muktinath. Sri Vaishnava tradition is a sub-sect of Hinduism, predominant in present-day Tamil Nadu in southern India. The river Ghantaki, flowing adjacent to the temple has a kind of stone called Salagram. The different patterns of the stone are worshiped as different forms of Vishnu. The colour white is considered Vasudeva, black as Vishnu, green as Narayana, blue as Krishna, golden yellow & reddish yellow as Narasimha and Vamana in yellow. The stones are found in various shapes with even shapes of conch and Chakra, the symbols of Vishnu. Religious significance The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Kulasekhara Alvar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Many devotees have contributed to it, most prominently the Alvars. Thirumangai Alvar could not reach Muktinath, but sang 10 pashurams from the nearest place, in praise of Lord Sri Murthy. Periy Alvar sang in praise of Sri Murthi as \\"Salagramamudaiya Nambi\\". The pontiff of Srivilliputtur (the most venerated Srivaishnava pilgrim centre in Tamil Nadu), Sri Manavala Mamunigal Mutt H.H 23rd peetam Sri Sri Sri Satakopa Ramanuja Jeeyar Swamiji installed the idols of Andal (Sri Gotha Devi), Ramanuja, and Manavala Mamunigal there during the yagna performed between 3 and 6 August 2009. This is considered by devotees to be a milestone in the history of Muktinath. A large crowd of devotees visit this shrine, where the Lord resides in the form of Sri Paramapatha Nathan with his divine consorts of Sri, Bhoomi, Neela and Gotha Devis.

The plurality opinion did not receive the support of more than half the justices, but still received more support than any other opinion, excluding those justices dissenting from the holding of the court.  United States  In Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), the Supreme Court of the United States explained how the holding of a case should be viewed where there is no majority supporting the rationale of any opinion: “When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.” Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977). That requires lower courts to look at all opinions to determine which is the most narrow compared to others. This opinion will be called the controlling opinion, and can be a mere concurrence, not the plurality.https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html Gregg v. Georgia (1976) \\"the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds\\" The Marks Rule has raised the following schools of thought regarding the appropriate basis for determining the holding in such fractured cases: (a) the narrowest analysis essential to the result derived from a combination of all concurring opinions,Pedcor Mgmt. Co. Welfare Benefit Plan v. Nations Pers. of Tex., Inc., 343 F.3d 355, 358-59 (5th Cir. 2003) (b) the concurring opinion offering the narrowest rationale,Horn v. Thoratec Corp., 376 F.3d 163, 175-76 (3d Cir. 2004) or (c) only those parts of the concurring opinions which overlap and arrive at the same result. For example, if one follows the first interpretation, then the holding in the case should be viewed as the narrowest rationale supported by all of the concurring opinions read together as though it were a single majority opinion, and where there is a conflict, the opinion based on the narrowest ground governs. Followers of the second rationale would find the concurring opinion offering the narrowest analysis to be the holding. Whereas, under the third interpretation, only the rationale(s) common to all concurring opinions which arrive at the same result(s) (and to the exclusion of all other rationales) is considered the holding. A good example of a plurality opinion can be found in the Supreme Court's decision in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, 553 U.S. 181 (2008). In considering whether Indiana's voter identification law passed constitutional muster, three justices believed the proper analysis was to apply the balancing approach laid down in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983). Three other justices agreed with the outcome of the Anderson approach, but believed the proper analysis was to apply the rule in Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428 (1992), which \\"forged Anderson's amorphous 'flexible standard' into something resembling an administrable rule.\\" Regardless of the approach used, a reading of the opinions together results in a holding that \\"neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation of voting procedure\\" is constitutional so long as the burden imposed by the regulation is minimal or not severe.

It was largely abandoned during the Hittite and Mittani periods then flourished again in the Iron Age, initially under Luwian speaking Neo- Hittites, and by the 920 BC had become a kingdom. In the 9th and 8th century BC it came under control of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and by the 7th century BC it had become a directly ruled Assyrian province. It is located in the Anti- Taurus Mountains of modern Turkey's Gaziantep Province. History Historical map of the Neo-Hittite states, c. 800 BC, showing the location of Sam'al at modern Zincirli (3). The site of Sam'al was occupied in the Early Bronze Age, and is thought to be part of the kingdom of Yamhad (Aleppo) early in the second millennium. It was then abandoned but later rose again in the Iron Age, eventually becoming a kingdom. With the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Sam'al became a vassal state and later a province of that empire. =Kingdom of Sam'al= Kingdom of Sam'al (in Samalian Yādiya, in Aramaic Ya'udi) was a middle power of the Middle-East in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE. It was near the Nur Mountains. Sam'al was the capital of the country. Royal steles and stone tablets from the period, of Kilamuwa and Panamuwa II, are the main sources for historical data about this timeperiod. King Barrekub prays in front of divine symbols. Detail of a stele from Sam'al. 8th century BC. Museum of the Ancient Orient, Istanbul It became a middle power at the end of the 10th century BCE. It had expanded from being a city state and gained territories from Carchemish, around Adana from Quwê and remained independent. It didn't become part of Cilicia. In 859 BC Alimus was saved with the help of Hayyanu, king of Sam'al. He didn't participate in the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, but Assyria had been blocked in the Western area. Though the campaign of Assyria in 825 BC occupied the vital territories of Sam'al, Quwê had been defeated, but it had been reorganised as Denyen. After the death of Shalmaneser III, Ya'udi again became independent. Some rulers of Sam'al had aggressive expansionist politics; others acceded to one of the anti-Assyrian Syrian coalition. Assyrian sources are not clear regarding Sam'al. Ya'udi was one of Assyria's satellite states in the annals of Shalmaneser III. Though around 830 BC Azitawadda, king of Denyen, states Ya'udi is his satellite country - at the same time, Kilamuwa mentions on his stela that he hired Assyria against Denyen. Other sources from the same period mention Ya'udi as a satellite state of Denyen and Assyria wanted to occupy this territory. Kilamuva might offer for Deyen to be a satellite state. Before this, he should defeat his greatest foe, Azitawadda. Assyrians won over Denyen and Sam'al in 825 BC. Sam'al became independent after the death of Shalmaneser III. There is an alternative opinion which states that Ya'udi and Sam'al were originally separate royal houses and Sam'al, the younger of the two, fought against the Assyrians at Alimus in 859 BC, in 858 BC when Shalmanser III crossed the Euphrates for the first time, and again in 853 BC at the Battle of Qarqar. The Kingdom of Sam'al was founded by Hayyanu and his successor was Ahabbu of Siri'laya (Zincirli) in 854 BC. Whereas Gabar, the founder of Ya'udi, and his successors became a member of the Assyrian satellites. This makes clear why Shalmaneser III lists Ya'udi (Bit-Gabbari) but not Sam'al as a satellite state. The Kingdom of Ya'udi wanted to open a corridor between Assyria and Denyen. It was prevented by the unified Syrian forces. This unity had been dissolved in 825 BC. After the death of Shalmanezer III Denyen couldn't occupy it but the Samalians could. Sam'al annexed Ya'udi and moved into the palace of Kilamuva. At the end, in 717 BC, Assyria occupied the country under the rule of Sargon II. Archaeology Reconstruction of the citadel The site was excavated in 1888, 1890, 1891, 1894 and 1902 during expeditions led by Felix von Luschan and Robert Koldewey. Each of the expeditions was supported by the German Orient Committee, except for the fourth (1894), which was financed with monies from the Rudolf-Virchow-Stiftung and private donors.Felix von Luschan, \\"Ueber einige Ergebnisse der fünften Expedition nach Sendschirli,\\" Zeitschrift für Ethnologie 34 (1902): 379–80. There were five excavation reports: * Volume 1: Felix von Luschan et al, Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli: Einleitung und Inschriften, Spemann, 1893 * Volume 2: Felix von Luschan and Carl Humann and Robert Koldewey, Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli: Ausgrabungsbericht und Architektur, Spemann, 1898 * Volume 3: Felix von Luschan, Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli: Thorsculpturen, Georg Reimer, 1902 * Volume 4: Felix von Luschan and Gustav Jacoby, Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli, Georg Reimer, 1911 * Volume 5: Felix von Luschan and Walter Andrae, Ausgrabungen in Sendschirli: Die Kleinfunde von Sendschirli, Walter de Gruyter, 1943 They found a heavily fortified teardrop-shaped citadel, which was surrounded by the as yet unexcavated town and a further enormous double fortification wall with three gates and 100 bastions. The field diaries of the excavation were lost during World War II. In August 2006, the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago began a new long-term excavation project at the site of Zincirli under the directorship of David Schloen. Seven seasons of excavation have been conducted through 2012.J. David Schloen and Amir S.

Three royal inscriptions from Ya'udi or Sam'al are particularly informative for the history of the area. The earliest is from the reign of King Panammu I, the others later at 730 BCE.

They are produced by Spanish company Magic Box Int., and PPI Worldwide Group, the sole distributor in North America. History Crazy Bones was inspired by a children's game played in Ancient Greece and Rome called 'Astragal' (Knucklebones), where children played a similar game using sheep's knucklebones. This ancient pastime is also known as Tabas. Games played are reminiscent of marbles and jacks. Crazy Bones is a modern version of this game, played with characters molded from plastic. There are hundreds of individual characters, each character having a unique face and name. Each series has a number of 'rare' (referred to as 'wanted', 'most wanted' or 'w' on trading cards.) pieces that are sought after by collectors and are sold on numerous websites for many times their original value. Crazy Bones was launched in the United States by Peter Gantner after witnessing the success of Barcelona-based GoGos in Spain, which had sold over 350 million packs from its inception in 1996 to 1997. Gantner formed Toy Craze in December 1997 with his brother David Gantner and businessman Scott Harris, and the company acquired the distribution rights in the US. Some sources indicate Bill Flaherty, who became President of Toy Craze, also founded the company. Gogos agreed to provide him with inventory with no upfront costs in return for 50% of all profits. This deal was later renegotiated, and the manufacturer was later paid a royalty of sales. Crazy Bones became a popular fad and collectible item in the late 1990s A small company at the time of inception, Crazy Bones became a popular fad in the late 90s. The product was aggressively marketed to children, and promotional events took place in scout meetings, club groups, fairs, and shows, where free sample packs were distributed. Toy demos have also taken place in SkyDome, where children were given free packs and taught how to play Crazy Bones. This promotion was organized by the Canadian marketers of Crazy Bones, a joint venture by Wayne Fromm and Eric Segal of All 4 Fun Consumer Products Ltd. All 4 Fun Toy Products Ltd. also created a series of Crazy Bones for the Toronto Blue Jays, a cereal promotion with Cap'n Crunch and another with Wrigley. In 1999 and 2000 Fromm and Segal created one of Canada's largest collectible fad in the toy industry. . Fromm conceived of a musical band based on Crazy Bones in 2000, called B2Krazy. This was a joint venture between Fromm, Segal and Iron Music. Nearly four million free packs have been distributed. Crazy Bones secured a number of high-profile partners, including McDonald's, which included the product as Happy Meal toys nationwide. These Crazy Bones were significantly larger than the normal toys, possibly to reduce risk of choking among young children. Within two years, the company's revenues had grown to nearly $17 million. By favoring tours of scout meetings and the like over television and print advertisements, Toy Craze has also kept its marketing costs to around 10%. Crazy Bones were originally distributed in Canada through the Concord, Ontario-based company Playtoy Industries, where they enjoyed similar success.http://www.strategyonline.ca/articles/magazine/19990104/24035.html Playtoy Industries declared bankruptcy in December 1999 and Wayne Fromm and Eric Segal catapulted Crazy Bones through a joint venture (www.frommtoys.com) Crazy Bones enjoyed incredible popularity in the late 1990s. From 1998-2000, 31.5 million packages were sold. Over 23 million figurines were sold in the UK and Spain in a recent relaunch between March and December 2008. Crazy Bones were banned in many schools, as they were blamed for encouraging theft, arguments, and in-class distractions. = Gogo's Crazy Bones in America = US Crazy Bones was first released by an American company HotShots. HotShots later lost or sold the Crazy Bone patent. Toy Craze then obtained, distributed and licensed it, with Magic Box int. manufacturing them. The original bones were small plastic figurines made with faces. Each bone had a different name and personality. The long line of characters included the well known Jaws, Top Hat, and Eggy. Slight variations in design with a shift to a more spooky nature, of 59-78, led to production of the Mutant set of bones. On the other hand, Things, Ghost, Aliens, Buddies, and Sports were intended as each containing brand new characters. \\"Sports\\" included 40 sports-uniformed Crazy Bones characters, whilst \\"Buddies\\" included 58 Gogos, each, like the past series, with its own function and design including: Liberty, Bookworm and Slick. In the \\"Things\\" series (60 units), all the bones are shaped like various everyday objects such as: a TV, a couch and a book, but as with the other series they had smiley faces. In the \\"Aliens\\" series, there are 60 different anthropomorphic figures of a classic grey, big eyed, alien. Some of the designs included: Salad Head (Caesar), Cyclops, Boris, Tut and others. A \\"Third\\" series of Crazy Bones (in the old packaging and design) named \\"The New Generation\\" was later released, including 120 all new characters.http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/crazybones_2092_530678 Some seem to be variations of the originals, or mutant original, but they are all meant as new characters to the series. A second sports series was released, but instead of uniformed characters, it features characters from the Original, Buddies, and Mutants series performing a sport (Eggy playing basketball or Speedy driving a car). There was also a series with magnetic characters, which are incredibly difficult to find. Rockers are music themed characters.

The multi-building complex opened between 1963 and 1967 and occupies almost an entire city block on State Street on the north bank of the Chicago River on the Near North Side, directly across from the Loop. Portions of the complex were designated a Chicago Landmark in 2016.https://www.architectmagazine.com/design/chicago-names-marina-city-an- official-landmark_o The complex consists of two , 65-story apartment towers, opened in 1963, which include physical plant penthouses. It also includes a 10-story office building (now a hotel) opened in 1964, and a saddle-shaped auditorium building originally used as a cinema. The four buildings, access driveways, and a small plaza that originally included an ice rink are built on a raised platform next to the Chicago River. Beneath the platform, at river level, is a small marina for pleasure craft, giving the structures their name.  History  The Marina City complex was designed in 1959 by architect Bertrand Goldberg and constructed between 1961 and 1968 at a cost of $36 million, financed to a large extent by Building Service Employees International Union, a union of building janitors and elevator operators, who sought to reverse the pattern of white flight from the city's downtown area. When finished, the two towers were both the tallest residential buildings and the tallest reinforced concrete structures in the world. The complex was built as a \\"city within a city\\", featuring numerous on-site facilities including a theater, gym, swimming pool, ice rink, bowling alley, stores, restaurants, and, of course, a marina. Marina City was built in a joint venture with Brighton Construction Company (owner: Thomas J. Bowler) and James McHugh Construction Company. James McHugh Construction Co. subsequently built Water Tower Place in 1976 and Trump Tower in 2009, both of which were also the tallest reinforced concrete structures in the world at the times they were built. Marina City was the first building in the United States to be constructed with the Linden climbing tower cranes. WLS-TV (ABC Channel 7) transmitted from an antenna atop Marina City until the Willis Tower (formerly known as Sears Tower) was completed. Local radio station WCFL operated out of Marina City in the office building of the complex. Local television station WFLD (FOX Channel 32) had its studios and transmitter at Marina City for 18 years until they were bought by Metromedia. Marina City was the first post-war urban high-rise residential complex in the United States and is widely credited with beginning the residential renaissance of American inner cities. Its model of mixed residential and office uses and high-rise towers with a base of parking has become a primary model for urban development in the United States and throughout the world, and has been widely copied throughout many cities internationally.

File:WABASH STREET BRIDGE OVER THE CHICAGO RIVER IN THE CITY, ONE OF MORE THAN EIGHT DRAWBRIDGES CROSSING THE RIVER IN THE... - NARA - 556200.tifThe towers as photographed by Documerica in October 1973  Architecture  The two towers contain identical floor plans. The bottom 19 floors form an exposed spiral parking ramp operated by valet with approximately 896 parking spaces. The 20th floor of each contains a laundry room and gym with panoramic views of the Loop, while floors 21 through 60 contain apartments (450 per tower). A 360-degree open-air roof deck lies on the 61st and top story. The buildings are accessed from separate lobbies that share a common below-grade mezzanine level as well as ground-level plaza entrances beside the House of Blues. Originally rental apartments, the complex converted to condominiums in 1977, but still contains a number of rental units. Marina City apartments are unusual in containing almost no interior right angles. On each residential floor, a circular hallway surrounds the elevator core, which is in diameter, with 16 sector-shaped units arrayed around the hallway. Apartments are composed of these units. Bathrooms and kitchens are located towards the inside of the building. Living areas occupy the outermost areas of each unit. Each unit terminates in a semi- circular balcony, separated from living areas by a floor-to-ceiling window wall. Because of this arrangement, every single living room and bedroom in Marina City has a balcony. The apartments are also unusual in that they function solely on electricity; neither natural gas nor propane serves any function. The apartments are not provided with hot water, air conditioning, or heat from a central source, as was the common practice at the time the towers were built. Instead, each unit contains individual water heaters, heating and cooling units, and electric stoves; residents pay individually for the electricity needed to run these appliances. This might have been a financial decision on the part of the building owners; at the time these towers were constructed, local electric utility Commonwealth Edison provided expensive building transformers at little or no charge, provided the buildings were made all-electric. In addition, the residential towers are noted for the high speed of their elevators. It takes approximately 33 seconds to travel from the lower-level lobby to the 61st floor roof decks.Building Facts (see Top Elevator Speed)marinacity.org. Retrieved from http://www.marinacity.org/bldgfact.htm. The towers were awarded a prize by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1965 for their innovation. The appearance of the towers is said to have inspired a similar design for the Corinthian Tower in New York. In 2007, the condominium board controversially claimed to own the common law copyright and trademark rights to the name and image of the buildings, although they do not own the parking garage portion of the buildings located below the 20th floor. They have claimed that any commercial use (such as in film or other media, such as on web sites) of pictures of the buildings or of the name \\"Marina City\\" without permission is a violation of their intellectual property rights.Condo ass. claims copyright on Chicago's Marina City Towers boingboing.netCondo board claims ownership of Marina City ‘name and image’ marinacity.org In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Marina City was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).  Current use  The complex houses the House of Blues concert hall, restaurant and bar, the Hotel Chicago, 10Pin Bowling Lounge, and four restaurants (Yolk, Smith and Wollensky, Katana, and Dick's Last Resort). The House of Blues concert hall was built in the shell of the complex's long-disused movie theater. Similarly, the hotel was built in what was once the Marina City office building. In order to accommodate Smith and Wollensky, the former skating rink was demolished. Pedestrian and vehicular access to the residential towers and the raised common plaza were redesigned. In 2006, decorative lighting was installed around the circular roofs of the mechanical sheds that top each tower; the towers had not contained any such lighting since the 1960s.

In the case of the Khazar Khaganate, the rulers of such vassal peoples as the Volga Bulgars (only until 969, after that they were independent and created a powerful state), Burtas and North Caucasian Huns were titled elteber or some variant such as Ilutwer, Ilutver (North Caucasian Huns), Yiltawar or İltäbär (Volga Bulgaria) (until 969). An Elteber (Almış) is known to have met the famous Muslim traveller Ibn Fadlan and requested assistance from the Abbasids of Baghdad. The earliest extant mention of the term is for a ruler of the North Caucasian Huns in the 680s, referred to in Christian sources from Caucasian Albania as Alp Ilutuer. The title was also mentioned in Letter to Kültegin in 732. It was used by rulers of pre-Islamic Volga Bulgaria during the period of their vassalage to the Khazars. Rásonyi (1942:92), apud Golden (1980:149), glossed an \\"il teber\\" as \\"one who steps on the il at the head of conquered tribes\\"; with il descending from Proto-Turkic *ēl \\"realm\\" (Clauson, 1972:121; Sevortijan, 1974:339) whereas täbär from Turkic root *täp- \\"to kick with foot\\" (or *tep- / *dēp- \\"to stamp, tramp\\"). However, Erdal (2007:81-82) objects to Rásonyi's proposal: Erdal points out that \\"the Orkhon Turkic aorist of täp- would be täpär\\" and instead suggests a non-Turkic origin for the title.

Sulong Subanen heritage During the Spanish regime, the Subanens were a thriving tribe in the hinterlands of Western Mindanao that had not been conquered by the Spanish colonists, who had their hands full waging wars with the Moros in the South. The ancestral Subanen domains were in the Pingolis and Dumangkilas areas. In the olden times, Pingolis consisted of the areas of Misamis Occidental, Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga del Norte. Dumangkilas consisted of Margosatubig up to the Dinas and Dimataling areas. The Spaniards came upon these places almost at the close of the 18th century but were never able to build a permanent settlement, only bayside watchtowers for any upcoming pirate attacks, in Margosatubig and Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur, and in the shores of Misamis, now Ozamiz City. Gumabongabon, a native of Cotabato, sought refuge in Mount Malindang in Misamis province to flee from the Muslim faith of Salipabunsuan (Shariff Kabunsuan). He had two sons named Dageneg and Daginding. The younger brother Daginding took over the Subanen leadership from his aging father Gumabongabon. Throughout his lifetime Gumabongabon was never conquered or subjugated either by the Muslim or Christian faith by remaining in the jungles with his family and those that continued his leadership. Daginding, the surviving son of Gumabongabon, is said to be the origin of the Imbings in Lapuyan. Daginding bore a son named Baless who took over the leadership from Daginding. Baless bore a son named Baan, then Baan begat Paluli, who also begat a son named Habali who begat Bongulan, who bore a son named Pamaisen. The latter also bore a son named Samaya, who bore a son named Lihaiwan, who bore a son named Sanira. It was at the time of the leadership of Sanira that he transferred his place to Salug Valley, now Molave town. There he met and married a wife from Dumangkilas, now Margosatubig, Zamboanga Del Sur. Sanira bore four children, triplets – two boys and one girl. The triplets were called Palaganding, Dainding, and Gumaed. The only girl was named Balao. Among the triplets, Palaganding became the leader after his father Sanira. He was the most feared Subanon leader. He ate his enemies' hearts raw after every battle. Palaganding married a girl from Pingoles and bore four sons, named Lumang, Mandaulay, Sandok and Talatap, and one daughter named Sinumpay. Son Talatap and daughter Sinumpay were kidnapped by pirates when they were fishing in Dumangkilas bay. Sinumpay was sold by the pirates to a Hadji Usah in Jolo, who married her and became a Muslim. Talatap's fate is not known. Palaganding’s eldest son Lumang took over the leadership of the Subanens when he died. Lumang bore three sons and two daughters. He named his sons Mandal, Bahong, and Imbing. He named his daughters Ames and Amog. Lumang's youngest son, Imbing, took over the leadership of the Subanens during the American regime. It was during this time that his victorious battle of Mount Guillian took place against the Iranons. Mount Imbing was named by American Governor-General Leonard Wood, who happened to stay with Timuay Beng Imbing on his way to Lakewood, where he saw a lake while flying during World War I. The lake was so beautiful surrounded by trees that General Wood named it Lakewood. Today, Lakewood is already a municipality which was a former barangay of Lapuyan, Zamboanga del Sur. Timuay Labi (highest) Beng Imbing bore six children — three boys and three girls. He named his boys Calay, Lumok and Purok, all with a title of Datu. He named his girls Calat, Calangian and the last Sindium. The last Subanen Datu among the Subanens was Datu Purok Imbing. After him, there was no more anointment. The American missionaries were already in Lapuyan and the saga of the Datus and Timuays ended its cruel and happy days. =Subanens and Christianity= In the olden days, the Subanens did not have schools; parents were in charge of schooling them. In a family of singers, the mother or the father sang Subanen epics and poems, and read legends and stories. Mothers trained their daughters to weave abaca cloth; the father usually trained their son to do wood carvings or weave rattan baskets and to make musical instruments out of bamboo and wood. When they came into contact with the Muslims, they learned about the teachings of Islam. Subanens of Lapuyan had early contact with the Spaniards who built a garrison in Margosatubig during the mid-19th century; a school for the natives was opened by Spanish priests but the Subanens misunderstood the message of Christianity. They were scared to see a stick (the cross) with a dead man (Jesus) on it. The cross, which they called \\"karehus\\", was interpreted differently; the early Catholic missionaries were thought of as cannibals. With the coming of the Americans, Protestant missionaries brought big picture rolls showing among others, the baby Jesus and the Mother Mary. The old folks associated these stories with their own tribal beliefs of a “Diwata” or God-child, a savior of mankind. With this understanding, Subanen elders now encouraged their children to go to the mission school run by these American missionaries. In 1912, Mr. & Mrs. David O. Lund opened a mission school in Sunglupa in the village of Thimuay Imbing, now a part of the Municipality of Lapuyan. Thimuay Imbing accepted the new religion, a Protestant denomination of the Christian and Missionary Alliance whose headquarters were located in Nyac, New York, in 1914; they constructed a semi- permanent-building called the Pampang Tabernacle where the Subanen worshipped. Next to the Tetuan Church in Zamboanga City, the Lapuyan Tabernacle became the first Alliance Church in Mindanao, if not the entire Philippines. There were further changes in the way of life of the Subanen in Lapuyan with the opening of government schools in 1919. The Subanen have now largely absorbed Western culture: notably in the way they dress and the way they build their houses, however they still have managed to preserve many of their customs and traditions.

As the metaphorical source of knowledge of art and science, it was popularized by a couplet in Alexander Pope's 1711 poem \\"An Essay on Criticism\\": \\"A little learning is a dang'rous thing; / Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.\\" The Pierian spring is sometimes confused with the Castalian Spring. Classical sources The sacred spring was said to be near ancient Leivithra in Pieria, a region of ancient Macedonia, also the location of Mount Olympus, and believed to be the home and the seat of worship of Orpheus.Orpheus and Greek Religion (Mythos Books) by William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, 1993, , page 62 The Muses \\"were said to have frolicked about the Pierian springs soon after their birth\\".Classical Mythology in Literature, Art, and Music (Focus Texts: For Classical Language Study) by Philip Mayerson,2001, page 82: \\"... the Muses who were said to have frolicked about the Pierian springs soon after their birth. The Castalian spring on Mount Parnassus ...\\"E.C. Marchant, Commentary on Thucydides: Book 2,Πιερίας—between Mount Olympus and the Thermaic Gulf, the original home of the muses and birth-place of Orpheus. The spring is believed to be a fountain of knowledge that inspires whoever drinks from it. The name of the spring comes from the Pierides, the gaggle of girls (daughters of King Pierus) who sought a contest with the Muses. When they lost, they were turned into magpies. Ovid tells this tale after explaining the origin of the Heliconian spring in his 8 AD narrative poem MetamorphosesV. The metamorphoses into magpies comes at the end of the book: > The greatest of our number ended thus her learned songs; and with concordant > voice the chosen Nymphs adjudged the Deities, on Helicon who dwell, should > be proclaimed the victors. But the vanquished nine began to scatter their > abuse; to whom rejoined the goddess; 'Since it seems a trifling thing that > you should suffer a deserved defeat, and you must add unmerited abuse to > heighten your offence, and since by this appears the end of our endurance, > we shall certainly proceed to punish you according to the limit of our > wrath.' But these Emathian sisters laughed to scorn our threatening words; > and as they tried to speak, and made great clamour, and with shameless hands > made threatening gestures, suddenly stiff quills sprouted from out their > finger-nails, and plumes spread over their stretched arms; and they could > see the mouth of each companion growing out into a rigid beak.And thus new > birds were added to the forest.While they made complaint, these Magpies that > defile our groves, moving their stretched-out arms, began to float, > suspended in the air. And since that time their ancient eloquence, their > screaming notes, their tiresome zeal of speech have all > remained.http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses5.html#6, [662] Project > Gutenberg's The Satyricon An early reference to the Pierian spring is found in the Satyricon of Petronius, from the 1st century AD, at the end of section 5 Sappho, too, refers to the roses of the Pierian spring, in her poem \\"To One Who Loved Not Poetry,\\" in the mid-600 B.C. Pope Lines 215 to 232 of Pope's poem read: :\\"A little learning is a dang'rous thing; :Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring: :There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, :And drinking largely sobers us again. :Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts, :In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts, :While from the bounded level of our mind :Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind; :But more advanc'd, behold with strange surprise :New distant scenes of endless science rise! :So pleas'd at first the towering Alps we try, :Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky, :Th' eternal snows appear already past, :And the first clouds and mountains seem the last; :But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey :The growing labours of the lengthen'd way, :Th' increasing prospects tire our wand'ring eyes, :Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!\\" In Greek mythology, it was believed that drinking from the Pierian Spring would bring you great knowledge and inspiration. Thus, Pope is explaining how if you only learn a little it can \\"intoxicate\\" you in such a way that makes you feel as though you know a great deal. However, when \\"drinking largely sobers\\" you, you become aware of how little you truly know. Later references The opening stanza appears in Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451, as Fire Captain Beatty chastizes Guy Montag, the protagonist, about reading books, which are forbidden in the society of the novel. In his poem \\"Hugh Selwyn Mauberley,\\" Ezra Pound refers to Pierian \\"roses\\" in a critique of the cheap aesthetic of his time, which in his opinion has replaced a true appreciation of art and knowledge: \\"Conduct, on the other hand, the soul 'Which the highest cultures have nourished' To Fleet St. where Dr. Johnson flourished; Beside this thoroughfare The sale of half-hose has Long since superseded the cultivation Of Pierian roses.\\" Sir William Jones (1746–1794) also made reference to \\"the fam'd Pierian rill\\" (a brook or rivulet) in his 1763 poem about the origin of chess, \\"Caissa\\". Henry Miller mentions the Pierian Spring in Moloch: or, This Gentile World, written in 1927-28 and published posthumously in 1992. In the 1986 David Cronenberg film The Fly, the protagonist Seth Brundle succumbs to madness and disease as the result of a science experiment.

According to the , it has a population of people. History The town's name is derived from the Cebuano term \\"mahayag\\" (ma = to become + hayag = bright) which means to become bright or sunny. When the Visayan migrants first trickled into the area after World War II, the place was heavily forested, which, to some looks dark and forbidding. Local historical sources had it that when a large \\"Dao\\" tree which stands in the townsite was felt, the place becomes bright, hence the expression \\"mahayag\\". Mahayag used to be the sitio of the barangay Molave in the municipality of Aurora. Early settlers of the area had endeavored for the creation of another municipality to fast-track development which is possible only by having a distinct political subdivision from the municipality of Molave. The town site for the new municipality was donated by Zacarias dela Torre and Pedro Alquizar Sr.. The municipality of Mahayag was officially created on March 9, 1960, pursuant to Executive Order No. 393 by President Carlos P. Garcia, with Saturnino Mendoza as its first appointed and subsequently elected Municipal Mayor. It was formed by the separation of 20 barrios from the municipality of Molave and 3 barrios from the municipality of Dumingag. Climate Barangays Mahayag is politically subdivided into 29 barangays.

Tourist destinations Eriberta Resorts The town of Mahayag has a high eco-tourism potential, particularly, the cold springs in Barangay Tuburan, the cave system in Barangay Kaangayan, and the Salug River that traverses the Municipality. Although the municipality has good eco-tourism potential, to date, only the cold springs in Barangay Tuburan have been developed as evidenced by the three private resorts in the area. This is the only tourist destination in Mahayag as of this time. Government investment to promote and to develop eco-tourism remains to be desired. The cave system in Barangay Kaangayan, for example, due to its proximity to the national highway, can be developed to promote spelunking activities. On the one hand, studies can be undertaken on the feasibility of promoting whitewater rafting in the rapids of Salug River. Education In addition to the daycare centers in each barangay, at least one (1) public elementary school exists in each of the 29 barangays in the municipality. There are six (6) public high schools and one private high school run by the Catholic Church in the municipality. Although permitted to operate and offer Collegiate courses since the later part of the 1990s, no tertiary courses had been offered by the Santa Maria Goretti Diocesan School except during the time when it served as an extension campus of the Saint Columban College, Pagadian City. College students who cannot afford to obtain their education from far places like Ozamiz or Pagadian, may still enroll post secondary classes or TESDA accredited short-term courses at the Pagadian Institute of Technology (PIT) campus in Mahayag, and college degrees like Bachelor in Secondary Education (BSED), Bachelor in Elementary Education (BEED) and Associate in Information Technology (AIT) at Josefina H.

Although it is part of the province of Berry, its architecture invites comparison with the Renaissance châteaux of the Loire Valley, notably the Château de Chambord. The manor was praised as \\"one of the most beautiful on earth\\" by George Sand, who also noted that \\"no king has owned a more picturesque park\\". It is at an elevation of 135 m. History Château de Valençay is located at the edge of a plateau overlooking the Nahon river. In ancient times, the site of the château was home to a Gallo-Roman villa called Valencia us, the domain of Valans. By the 10th or 11th century, a \\"heavy and massive tower\\" had been built, and between 1026 and 1047 a donation charter deeded Valençay to its first recorded lord, Bertrand. In 1220, the then-lord of Valençay, Gauthier, was reported to have built a feudal castle or house on the site, but it is unclear if this was an addition or an extension to the earlier tower. There are remains of the original structure buried under the courtyard. The modern château was built on a royal scale by the d'Estampes family of financiers over a period of some 200 years. Construction started in 1540 at the behest of Jacques d'Estampes in place of the demolished 12th- century castle and was not completed until the 18th century, when the south tower was added. The 18th century saw a rapid succession of owners, including the notorious Scottish banker John Law, who purchased the estate in 1719. Nearly a century later, in 1803, Napoleon ordered his foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand to acquire the property as a place particularly appropriate for reception of foreign dignitaries, notably Ferdinand VII of Spain, his brother Infante Carlos, Count of Molina and his uncle Infante Antonio Pascual, who would spend six years in Napoleonic captivity at Valençay. The treaty providing for their release in 1813 took the estate's name. The period of Talleyrand's occupancy was the golden age in the history of Valençay, with twenty-three communes reportedly administrated by the ruling prince. Undoubtedly the most celebrated of Talleyrand's servants employed at Valençay was his chef, Marie-Antoine Carême. After Talleyrand's death in 1838, the great statesman was buried in a small mortuary chapel in the park. His collateral descendants retained the ownership of the estate until 1952, when the male line ended. The last prince bequeathed the property to his stepson, who sold it to an association of historic chateaux in 1979. The Princes of Talleyrand-Périgord ranked among the mediatized German nobility, by virtue of their nominal control of the duchy of Sagan in Prussian Silesia (now in Poland). On this technicality, the château was spared the German occupation during the Second World War. Having established his personal neutrality, the Duke of Sagan saw treasures from the Louvre (like the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo) safely sheltered at Valençay.\\"The Louvre During the War\\" The Louvre, Paris, 2009.  Features  Angle tower of the Château de Valençay Relics of the 16th century include an outsized round tower at the western corner, capped by a dome à l'impériale, and the central block in the shape of a donjon, with a slender tower on each corner, grouped around the raking roof. Its feigned battlements are evocative of the Middle Ages, a retrospective formula stylistically derived from Chambord but somewhat vitiated by ample fenestration, including characteristic Renaissance dormers. The exterior has withstood time and the elements remarkably well. It is clothed in classical orders: the Doric order on the ground floor, the Ionic order on the first floor, and the Corinthian order on the second. This was an innovative feature anticipating French classicism. An arcaded gallery rings the courtyard. The western wing with its Mansard roof dates from the 17th century. Talleyrand's château boasts one of the most advanced interiors of the Empire style anywhere. There are a hundred rooms, of which a quarter comprise Talleyrand's apartments. A room of King Ferdinand is also shown to tourists. The western wing contains the Talleyrand Museum, formerly housed in outbuildings. The formal French gardens, dating from the early 20th century, cover about forty hectares, not counting the area of Talleyrand's vineyards. Llamas, peacocks, and other exotic animals kept in the park provide amusement for tourists. References *R.P. Raoul. Guide historique de Valençay. Le château-l'église-le tombeau de Talleyrand.

According to the , it has a population of people. History Center River of Margosatubig (Margus a Ig in Mranaw or Margusaig) Malakas na Tubig. The Subanens were believed to be the first people to have settled in this land, right near the swift flowing river that now traverse the Margosatubig Pilot School and Guiwan district. “Malagus Tubig” was the original name of the town, which was taken after the swift river current that kept changing its course towards the mouth of the Dumanquilas Bay. In the 15th century, the Spaniards arrived and found that its bay is a natural refuge from bad weather for their ships. Soon it became their choice settlement changing Malagus Tubig (Marugusaig) to its present name Margosatubig. They built a huge stone fort on top of a hill that served as their bastion against Moro pirates who used to raid the settlements along the Dumanquillas Bay and its vicinity. The fort was known as Cotta Heights. In 1963, it was demolished and is now the site of Pax High School. The Spaniards reigned for years and left as their heritage most evidently, the Chavacano dialect. Suffice it to say that more than a hundred years ago, Margosatubig already existed as a settlement of migrants and natives in the 19th century. From 1917 to 1936, Margosatubig stayed as a municipal district of the city of Zamboanga. During the Commonwealth Government and by virtue Executive Order No. 17 dated December 23, 1936 signed by President Manuel L. Quezon, Margosatubig finally became a regular and distinct municipality with eight original barrios. It can be said that Margosatubig is the oldest town in Zamboanga del Sur; older even than the undivided Province of Zamboanga. In 1950, the barrios of Punta Flecha, Pitogo, Qugbay, Balong-balong, Libertad and Dumanguilas were transferred to the newly created town of Dimataling In 1951, the barrios of Malangas, La Dicha, Diplo, Gusem, Buug, Matinaw, Gaulan, Tinungtungan, Manangon, Lindang, Luop, Silupa, Minsulao, Paruk, Lubing, Balabao, Mali, Baluran, Sampuli and Bacao, all from Margosatubig were separated to form the town of Malangas. Margosatubig, in spite of being a pioneer town, still remained isolated and reachable only by sea craft. In 1976, it was finally opened to the rest of Zamboanga del Sur by an asphalt road connecting it to Pagadian. This was facilitated by the Zamboanga del Sur Development Project undertaken by the Philippine-Australian Development Assistance Programme (PADAP), and its Electrification by ZAMSURECO-1 followed in 1979.

In the , it had people. It is in the eastern part of the province of Zamboanga del Sur, and has an area of . The name \\"Molave\\" refers to the tree (and its hardwood) that was common in the area. Its economy is focused on agricultural production, and of fertile land is irrigated and planted with rice. Corn, coconut, cassava, banana, camote and various vegetables are also grown. These are marketed to neighboring towns and cities, and reach Cebu. Due to its strategic location, Molave is becoming the commercial hub of the Salug Valley. Molave originated during the 1930s as a small settlement in a marshy jungle, originally known as Salug. The Subanons were early settlers of the area; the fertile land of the Salug Valley later attracted settlers from throughout the Philippines, making the area ethnically diverse. On June 16, 1948, the settlement was separated from the municipality of Aurora as a separate municipality and designated the new capital of the province of Zamboanga. Molave was the provincial capital until Zamboanga was divided into the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur; it became part of Zamboanga del Sur, with the town of Pagadian as its capital. Geography Molave is in the northeastern part of the province of Zamboanga del Sur, at the foot of a hill, and is bounded by the Salug River and mountains which protect it from typhoons. It is bordered by the municipalities of Tambulig in the east, Mahayag in the west, Josefina and Province of Zamboanga del Norte in the north, and Ramon Magsaysay in the south. Molave is about from Pagadian, the provincial capital, and from Ozamiz. It is above sea level. =Topography= Molave is divided into two topographical areas. The east and southwest lowlands, which cover 30 percent of its total land area, consist of nine barangays and are generally flat, swampy and marshy. The upland, which covers 70 percent of Molave's total area, is hilly and mostly deforested. The terrain is moderately sloping to rolling, with the overall grade varying from 10 percent in the lowlands to 27 percent in the mountains. The municipality has two types of soil. The lowlands and part of the upper barangays are composed of San Miguel silt loam, and is well- suited for cultivation. Adtoyon clay loam is found in the upland areas, and can be used for grazing and a variety of crops such as corn, cassava, and camote. =Climate= Molave is the fourth type on the PAGASA climatology map, with rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. Its average temperature is . Barangays Molave is divided into 25 barangays: History The Subanon people were early inhabitants of the area. Molave originated during the early 1930s as a small settlement in a marshy jungle which was known originally as Salug. The fertile soil of the Salug Valley attracted settlers from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, making the area's population a diverse mix of Cebuano, Boholano, Ilongo, Tagalog, Ilocano, Leyteño, Misamisnon, Surigaonon, and Muslim and other ethnic groups. A number of Chinese and Filipino businessmen settled in the region before World War II. The population influx enabled the settlement's rapid development. Molave became a municipality with Republic Act No. 286, authored by Congressman Juan S. Alano, on June 16, 1948. It was separated from the municipality of Aurora, established as a separate municipality, and designated the capital of the province of Zamboanga del Sur with the act. Molave was the provincial capital until Zamboanga's division in 1951 into the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur. It became part of Zamboanga del Sur, with Pagadian as its capital. Pelagio Blancia was appointed Molave's first mayor. Blancia was defeated in the 1951 elections, and Mayor Javier Ariosa moved the seat of government from Camp 7 (present-day Barangay Blancia) to its present site. Ireneo Glepa, the current mayor, was Molave's youngest and longest-serving vice mayor. Unopposed for two terms as vice-mayor, Glepa was elected mayor in May 2010.

Rice trading, milling and farming are major agricultural industries, and glass and aluminum are major non- agricultural industries. Molave's economy is focused on agricultural production; 91.85 percent of its total land area is devoted to agriculture, and are irrigated and planted with rice. Corn, coconut, cassava, bananas, camote, and other vegetables are also grown. They are marketed to neighboring towns and cities as far as Cebu. Molave has 23 farmer cooperatives (19 of which are registered), with a total membership of 7,566.

It is located on Washington Street, across from City Hall. =Castle Point= Castle Gatehouse at Stevens Institute of Technology North side Castle Point is the highest point in Hoboken. The name is a corruption of \\"Castille Point\\", due to its supposed resemblance to the Castilian coast in Spain. To early navigators, the high serpentine crag jutting over the river reminded them of a miniature Rock of Gibraltar (although the Rock of Gibraltar is actually in Andalusia, not Castile which has no coast). The land was bought at public auction in 1804 by Col. John Stevens, who built his estate there.\\"Hoboken, Castle Point\\", Historic Houses of New Jersey (1902). After his death, his son Edwin Augustus Stevens took responsibility of the estate and in 1853 built a 40-room mansion, the \\"Stevens Castle\\", on land adjacent to the point. It was acquired by Stevens Institute of Technology in 1910 and served as an administrative and residential building until 1959. Castle Point is still part of the Stevens campus. It overlooks Sybil's Cave. Castle Point also includes the surrounding area and streets such as the yellow brick Castle Point Terrace. Castle Point Park and Castle Point Skate Park are at the base of Castle Point, next to the Hudson River. =Clam Broth House= The Clam Broth House (1899-2004), was a landmark Hoboken restaurant that operated for over a century. The Clam Broth House opened in 1899. The restaurant attracted attention with several giant hand-shaped signs. There were two giant hand-shaped signs, one hanging on the outside of the Clam Broth House that pointed downward towards the entrance, and one on a neighboring building (which is the only sign still there today). In addition, there was a third, smaller hand-shaped sign. In 2004, the Clam Broth House building was condemned by city officials because of structural failures caused by construction workers, and destroyed. There were cracks and bulges in the building's facade prior to the building's destruction, and the facade also buckled in May 2003, causing it to be shut down. The Clam Broth House reopened in 2010, but was bought in 2012 by another restaurant, Biggie's Clam Bar. =DeBaun Auditorium= Stevens Hall In Edwin A.

Before July 29, its eyes were shut. The statue is a part of a shrine at the corner of Jackson Street and Third Street that is taken care of by Julio Dones, a partially blind man who says he noticed one of its eyes was open while he was cleaning it. He claims that it is a miracle, while others believe it was a hoax. Some believe that there were already eyes in the statue, and that eyelids were glued on and one of them fell off. Regardless of how it happened, the incident gained publicity quickly. On July 29, 2005 two local news stations, ABC and UPN, came to the shrine to report it live and interview people. It has since been called \\"The Miracle Statue\\".Nickell, Joe (August 9, 2005). \\"Statue Mystery Solved\\".

Bands like R.E.M., Sonic Youth, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, My Chemical Romance, Fugazi, They Might Be Giants and Nirvana have all played Maxwell's. Except for a small break in the 1990s, Maxwell's was a vital a part of the indie music until it closed. =Marineview Plaza= Marineview Plaza is a building complex made up of two 25-story buildings, built in Brutalist style. The Marineview buildings are the tallest buildings in Hoboken, New Jersey. Marineview Plaza One is the northernmost and Marineview Plaza Two is the southernmost. Both buildings are residential, and are bordered on the west by Hudson Street, on the north by 4th Street, on the east by River Street and on the south by 3rd Street. In 2001 many floors' views of the New York skyline were blocked by the 333 River Street complex. Even so, they are still visible from Manhattan.8 9 As well as having two 25-story buildings, the Marineview Plaza complex also has three smaller buildings, one of which (Marineview Plaza five) once housed Hoboken's only movie theater, which has since closed and been replaced by a bank. = Stevens Institute of Technology = The university is situated overlooking the Hudson. Sybil's Cave in 2013 =Sybil's Cave= 1841 map showing the location of Sybil's Cave at Castle PointSybil's Cave is a cave with a natural water spring, that is now buried at the bottom of the Stevens Institute of Technology hill, near the Castle Point Skate Park on Frank Sinatra Drive. One of Hoboken's best known landmarks, it was first excavated around 1832 by Hoboken's founder, Col. John Stevens III, and adorned with a gothic-style stone arch. Named after the ancient Greco-Roman prophetesses, it was originally Hoboken's biggest tourist attraction, for the magnesium-laced water that flows from the spring.Abernathy, Melissa (Summer 2014). \\"What the Heck is Going on with Sybil's Cave?\\". Hoboken 07030. pp. 24-37. Retrieved June 29, 2014. The cave gained national attention in 1841 when the body of a young cigar shop worker, Mary Cecilia Rogers, washed ashore nearby, an incident that inspired Edgar Allan Poe's The Mystery of Marie Rogêt, one of the first true-crime detective novels.

The cave was closed in 1880 due to health department concerns about water quality, and it was used as a cool storage locker for a nearby eating establishment. That establishment devolved into a seedy waterfront tavern and closed in the 1930s, when the cave was filled in with concrete and dirt. Around the time of World War I the cave fell into disuse and was sealed. It was reopened in October 2008 after former Mayor David Roberts worked with the Hoboken Historical Museum, Hoboken Brownstone company and others on a $106,752 renovation project to unblock the cave and make it accessible to the public. Today, although the exterior gate to the park is usually open 24 hours a day, the gate to the cave itself is locked, as its water was found to contain too many impurities to be drinkable, and the interior is rocky and slippery. As of December 2018, there are no plans to reopen it. =Weehawken Cove= Image of Weehawken Cove/North Hoboken Harbor taken by NASA. (Image on the right with red line shows where it is.) Weehawken Cove is a small cove that extends westward from the Hudson River. The cove straddles the boundary between Hoboken to the south and Weehawken to the north. Explorer Henry Hudson anchored his ship there on October 2, 1609. His first mate noted that Castle Point looked as if it contained silver mines. =United Synagogue of Hoboken= Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the United Synagogue of Hoboken is among the oldest synagogue buildings in New Jersey. Parks =Castle Point Park= Castle Point Park is a public park consisting of a walkway along the Hudson River, offering scenic views of Manhattan. Stretching north along the river from Frank Sinatra Park, it terminates near 10th Street, with Sinatra Drive following along its length. Castle Point Park runs past the bottom of Castle Point, home to the Stevens Institute of Technology. Historic Sybil's Cave is also visible from the park. Within the park is the Castle Point Skate Park, Hoboken's only designated skateboarding area. It features many ramps: one small half-pipe, one large half-pipe, one quarter pipe, and one 45° ramp, as well as several smaller ramps. =Church Square Park= Marconi monument Library Gazebo Renovation began in 2012 for Church Square Park after much community input as part of a citywide park improvement plan. New play equipment. A parents group is replacing out date equipment and soft surfacing added, fully updated bathrooms, the basketball courts are being resurfaced, fenced, and lighted. The dog park run is being resurfaced and re-fenced. Church Square Park is bordered on the west by Willow Avenue, the east by Garden Street, the north by 5th Street and the south by 4th Street. Park Avenue is blocked by the park. Church Square park is surrounded by landmarks, such as the OLG church, the Hoboken Public Library on the north side, the Demarest School Building on the east, and nearby Hoboken University Medical Center. In the eastern part of the park is a statue of the radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi, with a bas-relief tribute to the Four Chaplains. The statue was commissioned and donated by John Minervini to replaced the Italian 1939 World's Fair Marconi statue Mr. Minervini received from the Italian government. That original statue was damaged in transit when a rigging strap broke. Mr. Minervini added the four chaplains at the request of Mayor John Grogan. These details we're told by John Minervini to his stepson Joseph L. Giovannoli, who provided this edit. The Firemen's Monument, Hoboken is a statue of a fireman, in the western part of the park. There is a gazebo in the center of the park, it used to be a fountain, where weekly outdoor concerts are held in the summer and fall. The playground and swings are slightly southeast of the gazebo, and there are also 4 fields (formerly 6), a dog run, and many bushes. \\"No ball playing\\" signs have been put up in the fields. In 1994, the wooden playground that had been in place for a long time was destroyed and replaced with a safer playground. In 2005, a memorial grove, containing trees dedicated to a fire victim, was relocated to a less attractive part of the park to make way for a toddler playground, despite public opposition. Questions were raised about the toddler playground's necessity, and those opposed to the project argued that there was no need for it since there were already 3 playgrounds within Church Square Park. They also argued that the new toddler playground was an eyesore and had replaced too much open space (at the time, 6 major fields were reduced to 5). In March 2005, the oldest tree in Church Square Park was removed to make way for playground. Despite controversy, it was finished in April, 2005. =Columbus Park= Columbus Park is a park near Hoboken High School at the corner of 9th Street and Clinton Street originally designed by Charles N. Lowrie, who was landscape architect for the Hudson County Parks Department. There is a statue of Christopher Columbus in the center of the park. There is also a memorial dedicated to John A. Sacci, a beloved Hoboken High School History teacher, who was tragically shot on February 12, 1998. The monument was facilitated by students and to this day, the word \\"remembrance\\" is misspelled on the marble monument. There was once a one-of-a-kind playground, tall as a three-story building with unusual equipment. It was destroyed in October 2002 to make way for a more normal, packaged (and safer) playground, in the name of Deborah Lynn Williams, a woman who was killed in the World Trade Center in the September 11 Terrorist Attacks. Because of the new playground's memorial status, the original playground will probably never be re-built. The original playground was made up of 3 sections: the first section contained a complex of chains for climbing, 3 platforms, and a very tall slide made of plastic (probably the tallest in Hoboken), which curved and could be seen over 6 blocks away. The second section was a large castle-like structure with a slide, two entrances and a pole for sliding. The third section was a series of unusual and unique space-like metal domes, which kids could crawl through and create echos. There was also a fourth section including a fountain where children would play. No photos are known to exist of the original playground. =Hoboken Island= Hoboken Island is a planned park7 in Hoboken, New Jersey, connected by a bridge to Pier A's gazebo, honoring the September 11, 2001 victims. The park was among many designs submitted to create a Hoboken 9/11 memorial. The \\"Hoboken Island\\" concept by the FLOW group was chosen in September 2004. When the park is constructed, a beam of light is planned to be in the center. There are 57 victims recognized in the project. Currently, there is a temporary memorial already on Pier A, in the form of a tear drop. =Frank Sinatra Park= Sinatra Park Frank Sinatra Park is a park near Pier A, offering views of Manhattan. Built in 1998, it honors Frank Sinatra, who was born in Hoboken. Sinatra Park is shaped in a Roman amphitheater style with an area that faces the former site of the World Trade Center. The Hoboken Division of Cultural Affairs regularly produces events at the park such as their Thursday concerts featuring a variety of New Jersey- based and regional musical acts and \\"Shakespeare Mondays\\" present by the Hudson Shakespeare Company. Other attractions include a soccer field. On August 24, 2004, CNN broadcast live episodes of Inside Politics and Crossfire from the park.http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/24/hoboken/index.html =Gateway Park= Gateway Park is an official yet secluded park that was created in 2000 to help make the neighborhood more scenic. In 2002 Troop 146 cleaned up Gateway Park for Earth Day and also cleaned up nearby Jackson Street. The park itself has trees, grass, and a bird feeder. There is an official sign at the park that says \\"Your Park\\", although it does not say \\"Gateway Park\\" yet. The park, triangle-shaped and about the size of a gas station, is Hoboken's smallest park. Gateway Park is on the southwest corner of Hoboken, bordered to the south by the train tracks that separate Hoboken from Jersey City. To the east is an abandoned building (the Windsor Wax Company). The park also borders Newark Street and is at the intersection of Newark Street and Jackson Street. On two of the three sides the park is lined with pine trees. =Jackson Street Park= Jackson Street Park is a park on Jackson Street near 1st Street. Jackson Street Park is a young children's play park built within the shell of a historic building surrounded on three sides by buildings and open to the sky. It was fully renovated in the mid-2012 with new play equipment, soft surfacing. a water spray for summer use and a rock climbing wall. =Madison Park= Madison Park (also called Madison Street Park) is at the corner of 3rd Street and Madison Street. There's a large abstract painting on the building that faces it. The original playground since the park's founding in 1991 contained a metal slide and a community trellis. The slide and trellis were destroyed in December 2006 to make way for park \\"renovation\\". The original playground is still visible on Google Earth. =Pier A= Panorama of Manhattan from Pier A Pier A's grass field and gazebo, with Manhattan in the background. Pier A was originally used as a pier for ships and was recrafted as a park in 1999. It extends from the southern end of Hoboken (just north of the Hoboken Terminal) east into the Hudson River, with a view of the entire Manhattan skyline. At this point, the Hudson River starts to be affected by the tides in New York Bay. Pier A has a water- jet fountain, bike paths, rows of trees (some of them transplanted in maturity), a big field, a fishing area (with water pumps and cutting boards) and a gazebo at its eastern extremity. It is an example of good civic design, particularly the grass field which is firm and natural-looking though its sod is layered atop concrete. Since Pier A is the nearest park to downtown Hoboken, at lunchtime on weekdays, many office workers take the time to stroll on the pier. On hot, summer weekends, the grassy field is swarming with sun worshippers. In warm weather, movies are shown on the pier at night, the blazing Manhattan skyline rising behind the screen. On one Saturday during the summer, a town fair is held on Pier A, including music, craft shops and rides for the kids. Hoboken also has its Fourth of July celebrations on Pier A. The park has also been a performance venue. The most notable concerts were the Mumford & Sons concert of 2012,https://www.patch.com/new- jersey/hoboken/mumford-and-sons and the Americanarama Festival in 2013 which featured performances from Bob Dylan and My Morning Jacket.https://www.nj.com/hudson/2013/07/hoboken_prepares_for_folk_rock_phenom_bob_dylan_and_the_americanarama_festival_of_music_1.html Many people witnessed the September 11, 2001 Attacks from Pier A because it had good views of the World Trade Center. On March 11, 2002 a memorial service was held on Pier A. On September 11, 2003 a section of land was created as a memorial for the September 11, 2001 victims (by planting trees). Currently, there is a temporary memorial to victims in the form of a tear drop. A permanent memorial is currently under construction. =Stevens Park= Stevens Park is bordered on the west by St. Peter & Paul Church, on the south by the Marineview Plaza complex, on the east by the Hoboken Little League Field, and on the North by buildings of the Stevens Institute of Technology. Within Stevens Park is a large playground and one of the few unique playgrounds left in Hoboken. Other one-of-a-kind playgrounds that have since been destroyed include the very tall playground in Columbus Park, destroyed in 2002, and the wooden playground in Church Square Park, destroyed in 1994. There is also a very rare exposed section of serpentine rock in the southern portion of the park, which has been eroded away over the years by people stepping on it. In the central section of the park is a dog run, which is smaller than the one in Church Square Park, and as a result, the park area surrounding the dog run is cleaner. Also, in the western part of the park are two Dahlgren guns (from the USS Portsmouth) facing west towards the St. Peter & Paul Church's cafeteria. A scientist found ancient writings on a stone when he was studying the park. =Elysian Park= Elysian Park is a small park in Hoboken, New Jersey that is the last remnant of the Elysian Fields. Bounded on the west by Hudson Street, and the north and east by Sinatra Drive, Elysian Park has two play areas, a basketball court, a sprinkler, a dog run and rest rooms. The northern end of prestigious Castle Point Terrace ends at the park. Part of the 1954 film On The Waterfront was filmed there.\\"Photograph Record\\". Hoboken Historical Museum.

Commonly referred to as pectic enzymes, they include pectolyase, pectozyme, and polygalacturonase, one of the most studied and widely used commercial pectinases. It is useful because pectin is the jelly- like matrix which helps cement plant cells together and in which other cell wall components, such as cellulose fibrils, are embedded. Therefore, pectinase enzymes are commonly used in processes involving the degradation of plant materials, such as speeding up the extraction of fruit juice from fruit, including apples and sapota. Pectinases have also been used in wine production since the 1960s.Enzyme India, Pectinase. Available in: http://www.enzymeindia.com/enzymes/pectinase.asp. Accessed on 09/10/2008. The function of pectinase in brewing is twofold, first it helps break down the plant (typically fruit) material and so helps the extraction of flavours from the mash. Secondly the presence of pectin in finished wine causes a haze or slight cloudiness. Pectinase is used to break this down and so clear the wine. They can be extracted from fungi such as Aspergillus niger. The fungus produces these enzymes to break down the middle lamella in plants so that it can extract nutrients from the plant tissues and insert fungal hyphae. If pectinase is boiled it is denatured (unfolded) making it harder to connect with the pectin at the active site, and produce as much juice. Pectinases are also used for retting. Addition of chelating agents or pretreatment of the plant material with acid enhance the effect of the enzyme. Optimum environment As with all enzymes, pectinases have an optimum temperature and pH at which they are most active. For example, a commercial pectinase might typically be activated at 45 to 55 °C and work well at a pH of 3.0 to 6.5. Pectinase is commonly used in fruit industries to speed up fruit juice extraction. Pectinase can also be used to extract juices from cell walls of plants cells. Uses Pectinase enzymes are used for extracting juice from purée. This is done when the enzyme pectinase breaks down the substrate pectin and the juice is extracted. The enzyme pectinase lowers the activation energy needed for the juice to be produced and catalyzes the reaction.

According to the , it has a population of people. History Tabina was formed out of the Municipality of Dimataling on August 16, 1961, by virtue of Executive Order No. 443 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia. Upon its creation, Tabina has twelve (12) barangays which comprised its original territory. 4 new barangays (Capisan, Doña Josefina, New Oroquita, San Francisco) were later created. When the Municipality of Pitogo was created, barangay Limbayan was detached from the Municipality of Tabina to be added to the new municipality, thus, resulting in a total number of fifteen (15) barangays within its jurisdiction. Historically, the earliest settlers of Tabina were the Subanens who have settled in the different parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula. They are followed by the Muslims, and then the Christians. The name itself has many different origins, open to interpretation. One states that it comes from the inhabitants’ expression of “tabi-una”, a polite expression meaning “excuse me”.Â Another points out to the inhabitants’ characteristic expression of being talkative which, in the local tongue, is being “tabi-an”. Meanwhile, the Muslim immigrants were said to be attracted by the abundance of local seashells known as “binga” in their native tongue. It also happened to be called “ubina”. The Christians who happened to pass by Tabina inquired about the name of the place and, always hearing “bina”, modified it to “Tabina” and the name has stuck ever since. Most of Tabina is characterized as having steep mountains and undulating hills. The majority of the barangays tower to about 50 to 200 feet above sea level. There are no coastal plains or valleys in the municipality; the coasts themselves run down to shores and high cliffs. There are several tourist attractions in Tabina as well. There’s the Tambunan Beach and Marine Sanctuary, the Barangay Malim and Marine Sanctuary, Talisay Beach, and the Pod-ok Mangrove Boardwalk. Geography It is the southernmost part of Zamboanga del Sur, facing the area wherein the waters of Illana Bay flows out to the Moro Gulf. It is about 63 kilometers away from Pagadian City, the province’s capital. Its boundaries are the municipality of Dimataling on the north, the Celebes Sea on the south, the municipality of Pitogo on the west, and another body of water, Illana Bay, on the east. Tabina can be reached via land through a provincial road passing through five municipalities so those who are thinking of going to Tabina should prepare for a long journey through rural places. The municipality has a land area of 8,690 hectares and these are distributed to the municipality’s current 15 regular and de facto barangays. =Climate= =Barangays= Tabina is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. * Abong-abong * Baganian * Baya-baya * Capisan * Concepcion * Culabay * Doña Josefina * Lumbia * Mabuhay * Malim * Manicaan * New Oroquieta * Poblacion * San Francisco * Tultolan Demographics Education Tertiary * Josefina E.

Sagun; Chavacano: Municipalidad de Vincenzo A. Sagun; ), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is named after Zamboanga del Sur Governor and Representative Vincenzo Sagun. History There are no known historical records that can establish as to when the municipality started to exist as a community. What is known is that the municipality of Vincenzo Sagun as he is known today, was a product of the extraordinary efforts of a man bearing the same name. The man VINCENZO A. SAGUN was a former member of the House of Representatives, representing the Province of Zamboanga del Sur, who left \\"no stones unturned\\" in seeking the formal creation of this erstwhile barangay of its mother Municipality, Margosatubig. Thru this tireless endeavor, President Diosdado Macapagal signed Presidential Proclamation No. 177, series of 1965, which created the MUNICIPALITY OF VINCENZO SAGUN. In utmost recognition of the man whose efforts made it all possible for the municipality to exist as a distinct and separate local governing entity, the municipality was so named in his honor. Folklore tell us that the municipality's first inhabitants were the Subanons. They were to have established their settlements along the riverbanks and in the hinterlands as a very peaceful and highly coordinated tribe ruled by a powerful warrior-leader. Legend has it that this warrior-leader, called Culangan, possessed magical powers and is capable of superhuman strength-like jumping as high as seven feet with a 50-kilogram pig on his shoulders. These early settlers lived in a scattered, pocket-sized settlements. But to celebrate the \\"LOMPOK\\", a local religious rite, they congregate in a certain place they called \\"PAGBATAN\\". For quite some time the place was called as such, until it was changed to \\"KABATAN\\", meaning \\"the inhabitants\\". In fact, when Vincenzo Sagun was still part of Margosatubig, it was known as Barangay Kabatan. Geography Vicenzo A. Sagun is a coastal municipality that is found in the southern section of Zamboanga del Sur. It is in the Baganian Peninsula, some 60 kilometers northwest of the province’s capital of Pagadian City. As for its boundaries, the municipality of Margosatubig can be found on the north, while the south is occupied by Maligay Bay and Dumanquilas Bay, on the southeast and the southwest, respectively. The municipality of Dimataling cradles it on the east. The total area of Vincenzo A. Sagun makes up 8.15% of Zamboanga del Sur’s area, and .041% of the whole Zamboanga Peninsula Region. Of the 14 barangays that Vincenzo Sagun has, 11 of them are coastal, and most of the inhabitants are fisherfolk by trade and livelihood. The municipality is noted for its rich marine resources, with some parts being groomed to be prime tourist aquatic spot. One of the Vincenzo Sagun’s featured products are the dried fish which are usually exported to the other provinces. Climate Barangays Vincenzo A.

It was made of wood and gold and he attached specially trained eagles. Pieces of meat were attached at the top of each pole and the ravenous eagles were chained to the feet. As the eagles tried to reach the meat they caused the throne to fly. The craft flew the king all the way to China, where the eagles grew tired and the craft came down.

Dudley, Camp Dudley is the oldest continually running boys camp in the United States. It is located in Westport, New York, on the shores of Lake Champlain. In 1993, it was included within the Camp Dudley Road Historic District when listed on the listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History and traditions  = Early history = Early 20th century Sumner Dudley, long active in both the New York and New Jersey YMCA movements, was asked in 1884 to take \\"young honor YMCA members\\" camping. In 1885, he took seven boys for a week's encampment at Orange Lake, N. J. The next year Dudley moved the site to Twin Islands, Lake Wawayanda, N.J. Ultimately, the camp settled on Lake Champlain, N.Y., in 1908. Dudley referred to the first camp as Camp Baldhead , and later the Boys' Camping Society (B.C.S.). After Dudley's death in 1897, the camp was renamed Camp Dudley. In 2015 Camp Dudley officially parted ways with the YMCA after respectful discussions concerning the YMCA's desire to have control over Camp Dudley and Camp Dudley's desire to remain independent. = Camp numbers = Campers are assigned camp numbers in ascending order based on when they first attended Camp. The first camp number (No. 1) was assigned George Peck in 1903. Since then, over 25,000 campers, leaders, and staff have each been given a unique, identifying number. At alumni gatherings, there is often a competition to see who in attendance has the lowest (or oldest) camp number.  Mission and values  No longer officially operated by the YMCA, Camp Dudley is an independent camp managed by the Board of Managers. It draws from the YMCA's own tenets of mind, body, and spirit. Though non-denominational, the camp espouses \\"Christian values\\" in its teachings and programs, not least of which is its motto, \\"The Other Fellow First\\". The mission is to develop moral, personal, physical and leadership skills in the spirit of fellowship and fun, enabling boys and girls to lead lives characterized by devotion to others. Thanks to a strong and financially supportive alumni base, the camp offers scholarships to those in financial need. In the summer of 2006, Camp Dudley acquired a sister camp in Colchester, Vermont called Camp Dudley at Kiniya, after purchasing the former Camp Kiniya from the Williams family. A driving force in this expansion was for the daughters of Camp Dudley alumni to have a place to learn the same ethics and values that their sons could learn at Camp Dudley. Alumni One of the unique characteristics of Dudley is the loyalty and support of its alumni. For most campers, their relationship with Dudley does not end with the close of the camping season but continues throughout their lives. Many former campers return as Leaders, and alumni and parents contribute to Dudley through their financial support. All friends of Dudley are invited to attend the alumni gatherings, as well as the August CDA Reunion at Camp. Between 35 and 40 alumni gatherings are held during the year throughout the country and around the world on the Dudley \\"Reunion Trail\\". 2009 was Camp Dudley's 125th summer. Camp Dudley at Kiniya In 2006 Camp Dudley officially acquired Camp Kiniya to expand its rich camping tradition to girls. Camp Kiniya was founded in 1919 by Helen Van Buren and lies on the Vermont shores of Lake Champlain, in Colchester. Traditions at Camp Kiniya include the Kiwi Day, where the entire camp celebrates campers and staffers who have attended for four years or more. Camp Dudley at Kiniya has grown into a balanced blend of both camps, including traditions from each original camp. There are 16 camper cabins, with additional staff cabins. The camp is divided into two divisions, Junior Division and Senior Division. Summer 2018 was the camp's 100th summer.  Campers, Leadership, Leaders, and Staff  At both Dudley and Kiniya, there are cabins that support a variety of ages. At Dudley, campers are typically 10-14, and at Kiniya campers are 10-14. Girls and boys are placed in cabins based on their ages. The cabins are divided into divisions: Cubs, Plebes, Juniors, and Seniors for Dudley and Cubs, Cats, Juniors and Seniors for Kiniya. Kiniya is, in general, a smaller camp, with fewer campers and less acreage. When you finish your last camper year, you may apply to become an Aide, the first step on the road in being a leader. An Aide lives in cabins with young campers but still has the opportunity to play on sports teams with the oldest campers. At 16 and 17, you can become a Junior Leader or Assistant Leader, paid positions in cabins that are designed to support the leader. At 18, one may become a leader, the main counselor in the cabin. One can also be a program staff member at 18 and beyond, working in the Athletics, Arts, Outdoors, or Waterfront departments.  Daily Activities/Program Areas  = Athletics = There are many athletic opportunities for boys and girls to participate in. There is: * Basketball * Soccer * Softball/Baseball * Tennis * Golf * Ultimate Frisbee * Handball * Lacrosse * Archery These are played in a major, a specialized activity block for each child, or team competition, a time of the day where teams play sports against each other to learn the value of respect and good sportsmanship. = Arts = * Theatre * Arts and Crafts * Theatre Tech * Music * Ceramics = Outdoors = * Hiking and Overnight Camping * Challenge Course Elements (low and high) * Camp craft = Waterfront = * Kayaking * Canoeing * Sailing * Paddle boarding * Swimming * Boating * Windsurfing * Diving = Spiritual = There is a very profound spiritual life at Kiniya and Dudley, especially on Sundays. There is a chapel service on Sunday mornings with a guest speaker. Their purpose is to inspire the children with encouraging words for the following week. It is meant to help campers more fully understand \\"The Other Fellow First\\", and provides an atmosphere of togetherness and unity. The speakers provide many valuable life lessons in their speeches. All campers and staff members wear the camps' traditional blue and white colors to this service. On Sunday nights, the camps individually gather to sing Hymns. This is one of the most valued traditions of both Dudley and Kiniya. = Other Activities = Every Wednesday and Saturday shows are performed by the campers and staff. Wednesday nights are talent shows, and Saturday nights are scripted plays. Each division has its own extravaganza once a session, which is a themed day planned by the division's leaders.

Computerization has changed the way organizations are approaching their decision-making because it requires that they automate more decisions, to handle response times and unattended operation required by computerization, and because it has enabled \\"information-based decisions\\" – decisions based on analysis of historical behavioral data, prior decisions, and their outcomes. Overview Decision management is described as an \\"emerging important discipline, due to an increasing need to automate high-volume decisions across the enterprise and to impart precision, consistency, and agility in the decision-making process\\". Decision management is implemented \\"via the use of rule-based systems and analytic models for enabling high-volume, automated decision making\\". Organizations seek to improve the value created through each decision by deploying software solutions (generally developed using BRMS and predictive analytics technology) that better manage the tradeoffs between precision or accuracy, consistency, agility, speed or decision latency, and cost of decision-making within organizations. The concept of decision yield, for instance, focuses on all five key attributes of decision-making: more targeted decisions (precision); in the same way, over and over again (consistency); while being able to adapt \\"on-the-fly\\" (business agility) while reducing cost and improving speed, is an overall metric for how well an organization is making a particular decision.http://custom.hbsp.com/b01/en/implicit/product.jhtml?login=FAIR060805&password;=FAIR060805&pid;=F0506F Organizations are adopting decision management technology and approaches because they need a higher return from previous infrastructure investments, are dealing with increasing business decision complexity, face competitive pressure for more sophisticated decisions and because increasingly short windows of competitive advantage means that the speed of business is outpacing speed of information technology to react. Other terms used include \\"intelligent process automation\\" (where decision management is combined with business process management). Approach There are a number of different approaches used to apply decision management principles. In general these follow three steps: # Decision identification and decision modeling using either open standards such as Decision Model and Notation or proprietary approaches such as The Decision Model # Development of a system or service (often called a Decision Service) that automates all or part of the decision # Ongoing monitoring and management of the decision to keep the business rules and predictive analytics models used up to date Decision management often involves the use of A/B testing and experimentation as well.

In his seven appearances on the US team he played top board three times and second board twice, and the team collected one gold and five bronze medals. From 1969 until 1991 Kavalek was a leading player for the German team in Solingen. During his tenure the team won 10 national championships in 1969, 1971,1972,1973,1974, 1975, 1980, 1981, 1987 and 1988 and the 1976 and 1990 European Club Championships. In the 1977–79 European Club championship, Kavalek scored 5.5/6 on the top board, including two wins over V. Smyslov. In the Nordic team vs. United States in Reykjavik in 1986, Kavalek on second board defeated Bent Larsen 1.5-0.5. In the match Moscow vs. Prague in April 1968, Kavalek beat Evgeny Vasyukov 1.5-0.5. In 1976, Kavalek was the top player on the Washington Plumbers team that won the National Chess League. =Matches= Kavalek won two international matches: * In 1969 - won a 10-game match against the Dutch champion Hans Ree in Eersel, the Netherlands, with the score of 7 to 3.Di Felice 2013c, p. 227. * In 1978, Kavalek won a match against the world-class Swedish grandmaster Ulf Andersson by the impressive score of 6.5 to 3.5. The match was held in the showroom of a Volvo dealership in Washington, D.C. Kavalek lost two matches against two of the world's best players in Solingen, Germany. In 1970 he lost to Bent Larsen with a score 2-6 and in 1977 he was defeated by Boris Spassky 2–4. =Rating= Kavalek ranked among the top 100 players in the world continuously from the end of 1962 until September 1988, peaking at number 10 in 1974, when he achieved his peak Elo rating of 2625 on the FIDE Rating list. By Chessmetrics ratings, he achieved his peak ranking of number 18 in early 1974 with a Chessmetrics rating of 2695. Coaching Kavalek had a notable coaching career, working with Mark Diesen, Robert Byrne, Yasser Seirawan, Eugene Torre and Robert Hübner. Kavalek was also one of Bobby Fischer's seconds in the World Chess Championship 1972 and served as British grandmaster Nigel Short's trainer in the 1990 Interzonal in Manila, and in Short's successful Candidates matches against British grandmaster Jonathan Speelman, Israeli grandmaster Boris Gelfand, former world champion Anatoly Karpov and Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman, leading up to Short's 1993 world championship match against Garry Kasparov. Short and Kavalek parted company shortly after the beginning of the latter match, which Kasparov won decisively. Short and Kavalek later wrote articles for chess magazines criticizing each other. Kavalek was acting captain and team analyst of the Rest of the World team against the Soviet Union in London in 1984.  Organizing  * Kavalek was the chief organizer of the prestigious Man and his World Chess Challenge in Montreal in 1979. * Serving as the Executive Director of the Grandmasters Association, he organized the first World Cup series in 1988–1989. * He also organized the Prague 90 tournament in August/September 1990 under the auspices of the Czechoslovak president Václav Havel.  Publications  World Champion Viswanathan Anand analyzes a game with Kavalek in Prague in 2011 = Magazine and newspaper articles = Kavalek was selected to Gallery of Distinguished Chess Journalists in 2006 and won Chess Journalists of America awards for the best newspaper column. Between 1960 and 2012 Kavalek's chess magazine articles have appeared in different print and online publications such as Chess Life & Review (1970–1979) and British Chess Magazine (1994–2010). He was editor-in-chief of chess publishing for RHM Press in New York from 1973 to 1986. He was the chess columnist for The Washington Post from 1986 to 2010, his last column running on January 4, 2010. In May 2010 he became the chess columnist for The Huffington Post. He was a member of the jury to select the best and most important games in Chess Informant (1989–1993). = Books = * \\"The Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense\\" with Efim Geller, Svetozar Gligorić and Boris Spassky, published by RHM Press in 1976 – * \\"Wijk aan Zee Grandmaster Chess Tournament 1975\\" published by RHM Press in 1976 – ; \\"One of the greatest tournament books of all time\\" – Sidney Fried, Publisher * \\"World Cup Chess: The Grandmasters' Grand Prix,\\" published in England by Bloomsbury Publishing in 1990 – and in the U.S. by Trafalgar Square Publishing in 1990 – * \\"Tilburg 1977 – Sachovy turnaj velmistru\\" (in Czech), published by SACHInfo in 2002 –  Brilliancy and best game prizes  Kavalek's three most important prizes: *At the 1962 Student Olympiad in Mariánské Lázně, Czechoslovakia, the brilliancy prize was awarded to arguably the most famous game ever played at the Student Olympiads – Kavalek's victory over the Soviet master Eduard Gufeld.

Roth Jr. Bridge (originally the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Bridge and also referred to as the Roth Bridge) is a concrete and steel cable-stayed bridge that spans the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal near St. Georges, Delaware. The bridge is located near a tolled section of Delaware Route 1 that runs parallel to the St. Georges Bridge carrying U.S. Route 13. In November 2006, the bridge was named after U.S. Senator William V. Roth, Jr., who not only lent his name to the Roth IRA, but was instrumental in securing federal funding to build the bridge. It is owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and does not carry a toll, despite the location of a nearby toll plaza. History Plans for a new bridge began in the 1980s when former Governor Michael N. Castle investigated a new canal crossing to replace the aging St. Georges Bridge. The bridge plans later became incorporated into the \\"Relief Route\\" plans for an upgraded US 13 as a toll freeway, as the narrower surface roads were over-capacity with north-south traffic. The project took about a decade to overcome various political and social obstacles, and construction began in 1992 on the new freeway and bridge. The freeway north of the bridge from Tybouts Corner to Christiana, was originally designated as a southward extension of Delaware Route 7. It was redesignated as a northward extension of Delaware Route 1 once the bridge was completed on December 9, 1995, concurrent with the opening of the Relief Route freeway from Tybouts Corner to Biddles Corner. After its opening in 1995, the Corps of Engineers rerouted US 13 onto the new bridge. The old St. Georges Bridge was scheduled to be demolished, however local opposition saved the bridge and it was rehabilitated with new lead-free paint, new roadway deck, and several joint and structural repairs that allows heavier vehicles to use it. After the multi-year rehabilitation project, which lasted from 1998-2001, US 13 was returned to the St. Georges Bridge. Though the entire Relief Route was planned as a toll road, it was later agreed to install the tollbooths past the US 13 exit south of the canal, so as to keep both crossings toll free. In December 2018, US 13 was temporarily detoured over the Roth Bridge when the St. Georges Bridge was closed for repairs. The repairs are expected to be complete within four months of closing, for a March 2019 reopening. Physical description The Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge, the first cable-stayed bridge of its type in the Delaware Valley area (all previous Delaware River or C & D Canal bridges are either suspension, cantilever, or simple truss designs), is also the first pre-cast concrete bridge to be built in the United States. Modeled after that of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, Florida, the bridge incorporates many features not found on the other canal bridges: * Fixed high-level crossing, a clearance like that of the other Canal highway crossings. * center span, with the major anchorages out of the water (thus preventing a catastrophic collision similar to the old Sunshine Skyway Bridge and previous C & D Canal bridges) * Six travel lanes, with the option of restriping to eight * Pull-off emergency shoulders on both sides (under the current striping arrangement) * Roadway lighting – they were removed in 2003 at the requests of canal pilots and replaced with low-voltage low-pressure sodium floodlights that illuminate the main support anchors * 65-mph speed limit * Separate approach spans, only joining at the anchorages of the cables The bridge also incorporates a 3% climbing grade, a feature lacked on the nearby St. Georges Bridge. The bridge, built between 1991 and 1994, utilized pre-cast concrete segments that were made in Cape Charles, Virginia, and transported by barge until it reached the job site. Once at the site, the segments were fitted into place like that of a jigsaw puzzle.  Awards  * 1995: Harry H.

Roth Jr. Bridge"},{"id":"2144362","text":"A voice-user interface (VUI) makes spoken human interaction with computers possible, using speech recognition to understand spoken commands and answer questions, and typically text to speech to play a reply. A voice command device (VCD) is a device controlled with a voice user interface. Voice user interfaces have been added to automobiles, home automation systems, computer operating systems, home appliances like washing machines and microwave ovens, and television remote controls. They are the primary way of interacting with virtual assistants on smartphones and smart speakers. Older automated attendants (which route phone calls to the correct extension) and interactive voice response systems (which conduct more complicated transactions over the phone) can respond to the pressing of keypad buttons via DTMF tones, but those with a full voice user interface allow callers to speak requests and responses without having to press any buttons. Newer VCDs are speaker-independent, so they can respond to multiple voices, regardless of accent or dialectal influences. They are also capable of responding to several commands at once, separating vocal messages, and providing appropriate feedback, accurately imitating a natural conversation. Overview A VUI is the interface to any speech application. Controlling a machine by simply talking to it was science fiction only a short time ago. Until recently, this area was considered to be artificial intelligence. However, advances in technologies like text-to- speech, speech-to-text, Natural Language Processing, and cloud services, in general, contributed to the mass adoption of these types of interfaces. VUIs have become more commonplace, and people are taking advantage of the value that these hands-free, eyes-free interfaces provided in many situations. VUIs need to respond to input reliably, or they will be rejected and often ridiculed by their users. Designing a good VUI requires interdisciplinary talents of computer science, linguistics and human factors psychology – all of which are skills that are expensive and hard to come by. Even with advanced development tools, constructing an effective VUI requires an in-depth understanding of both the tasks to be performed, as well as the target audience that will use the final system. The closer the VUI matches the user's mental model of the task, the easier it will be to use with little or no training, resulting in both higher efficiency and higher user satisfaction. A VUI designed for the general public should emphasize ease of use and provide a lot of help and guidance for first-time callers. In contrast, a VUI designed for a small group of power users (including field service workers), should focus more on productivity and less on help and guidance. Such applications should streamline the call flows, minimize prompts, eliminate unnecessary iterations and allow elaborate \\"mixed initiative dialogs\\", which enable callers to enter several pieces of information in a single utterance and in any order or combination. In short, speech applications have to be carefully crafted for the specific business process that is being automated. Not all business processes render themselves equally well for speech automation. In general, the more complex the inquiries and transactions are, the more challenging they will be to automate, and the more likely they will be to fail with the general public. In some scenarios, automation is simply not applicable, so live agent assistance is the only option. A legal advice hotline, for example, would be very difficult to automate. On the flip side, speech is perfect for handling quick and routine transactions, like changing the status of a work order, completing a time or expense entry, or transferring funds between accounts. History Early applications for VUI included voice-activated dialing of phones, either directly or through a (typically Bluetooth) headset or vehicle audio system. In 2007, a CNN business article reported that voice command was over a billion dollar industry and that companies like Google and Apple were trying to create speech recognition features. It has been years since the article was published, and since then the world has witnessed a variety of voice command devices. In addition, Google created a speech recognition engine called Pico TTS and Apple has released Siri. Voice command devices are becoming more widely available, and innovative ways for using the human voice are always being created. For example, Business Week suggests that the future remote controller is going to be the human voice. Currently Xbox Live allows such features and Jobs hinted at such a feature on the new Apple TV. Voice command software products Both Apple Mac and Windows PC provide built in speech recognition features for their latest operating systems. =Microsoft Windows= Two Microsoft operating systems, Windows 7 and Windows Vista, provide speech recognition capabilities. Microsoft integrated voice commands into their operating systems to provide a mechanism for people who want to limit their use of the mouse and keyboard, but still want to maintain or increase their overall productivity. Windows Vista With Windows Vista voice control, a user may dictate documents and emails in mainstream applications, start and switch between applications, control the operating system, format documents, save documents, edit files, efficiently correct errors, and fill out forms on the Web. The speech recognition software learns automatically every time a user uses it, and speech recognition is available in English (U.S.), English (U.K.), German (Germany), French (France), Spanish (Spain), Japanese, Chinese (Traditional), and Chinese (Simplified). In addition, the software comes with an interactive tutorial, which can be used to train both the user and the speech recognition engine. Windows 7 In addition to all the features provided in Windows Vista, Windows 7 provides a wizard for setting up the microphone and a tutorial on how to use the feature. Mac OS X All Mac OS X computers come pre-installed with the speech recognition software. The software is user- independent, and it allows for a user to, \\"navigate menus and enter keyboard shortcuts; speak checkbox names, radio button names, list items, and button names; and open, close, control, and switch among applications.\\" However, the Apple website recommends a user buy a commercial product called Dictate. =Commercial products= If a user is not satisfied with the built in speech recognition software or a user does not have a built speech recognition software for their OS, then a user may experiment with a commercial product such as Braina Pro or DragonNaturallySpeaking for Windows PCs, and Dictate, the name of the same software for Mac OS. Voice command mobile devices Any mobile device running Android OS, Microsoft Windows Phone, iOS 9 or later, or Blackberry OS provides voice command capabilities. In addition to the built speech recognition software for each mobile phone's operating system, a user may download third party voice command applications from each operating system's application store: Apple App store, Google Play, Windows Phone Marketplace (initially Windows Marketplace for Mobile), or BlackBerry App World. =Android OS= Google has developed an open source operating system called Android, which allows a user to perform voice commands such as: send text messages, listen to music, get directions, call businesses, call contacts, send email, view a map, go to websites, write a note, and search Google. The speech recognition software is available for all devices since Android 2.2 \\"Froyo\\", but the settings must be set to English. Google allows for the user to change the language, and the user is prompted when he or she first uses the speech recognition feature if he or she would like their voice data to be attached to their Google account. If a user decides to opt into this service, it allows Google to train the software to the user's voice. Google introduced the Google Assistant with Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\". It is much more advanced than the older version. Amazon.com has the Echo that uses Amazon's custom version of Android to provide a voice interface. =Microsoft Windows= Windows Phone is Microsoft's mobile device's operating system. On Windows Phone 7.5, the speech app is user independent and can be used to: call someone from your contact list, call any phone number, redial the last number, send a text message, call your voice mail, open an application, read appointments, query phone status, and search the web. In addition, speech can also be used during a phone call, and the following actions are possible during a phone call: press a number, turn the speaker phone on, or call someone, which puts the current call on hold. Windows 10 introduces Cortana, a voice control system that replaces the formerly used voice control on Windows phones. =iOS= Apple added Voice Control to its family of iOS devices as a new feature of iPhone OS 3. The iPhone 4S, iPad 3, iPad Mini 1G, iPad Air, iPad Pro 1G, iPod Touch 5G and later, all come with a more advanced voice assistant called Siri. Voice Control can still be enabled through the Settings menu of newer devices. Siri is a user independent built-in speech recognition feature that allows a user to issue voice commands. With the assistance of Siri a user may issue commands like, send a text message, check the weather, set a reminder, find information, schedule meetings, send an email, find a contact, set an alarm, get directions, track your stocks, set a timer, and ask for examples of sample voice command queries. In addition, Siri works with Bluetooth and wired headphones. =Amazon Alexa= In 2014 Amazon introduced the Alexa smart home device. Its main purpose was just a smart speaker, that allowed the consumer to control the device with their voice. Eventually, it turned into a novelty device that had the ability to control home appliance with voice. Now almost all the appliances are controllable with Alexa, including light bulbs and temperature. By allowing voice control Alexa can connect to smart home technology allowing you to lock your house, control the temperature, and activate various devices. This form of A.I allows for someone to simply ask it a question, and in response the Alexa searches for, finds, and recites the answer back to you.https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon- echo-and-alexa-history-from-speaker-to-smart-home-hub-2017-5 Speech recognition in cars As car technology improves, more features will be added to cars and these features will most likely distract a driver. Voice commands for cars, according to CNET, should allow a driver to issue commands and not be distracted. CNET stated that Nuance was suggesting that in the future they would create a software that resembled Siri, but for cars. Most speech recognition software on the market in 2011 had only about 50 to 60 voice commands, but Ford Sync had 10,000. However, CNET suggested that even 10,000 voice commands was not sufficient given the complexity and the variety of tasks a user may want to do while driving. Voice command for cars is different from voice command for mobile phones and for computers because a driver may use the feature to look for nearby restaurants, look for gas, driving directions, road conditions, and the location of the nearest hotel. Currently, technology allows a driver to issue voice commands on both a portable GPS like a Garmin and a car manufacturer navigation system. List of Voice Command Systems Provided By Motor Manufacturers: * Ford Sync * Lexus Voice Command * Chrysler UConnect * Honda Accord * GM IntelliLink * BMW * Mercedes * Pioneer * Harman * Hyundai  Non-verbal input  While most voice user interfaces are designed to support interaction through spoken human language, there have also been recent explorations in designing interfaces take non-verbal human sounds as input. In these systems, the user controls the interface by emitting non- speech sounds such as humming, whistling, or blowing into a microphone. One such example of a non-verbal voice user interface is Blendie, an interactive art installation created by Kelly Dobson. The piece comprised a classic 1950s-era blender which was retrofitted to respond to microphone input. To control the blender, the user must mimic the whirring mechanical sounds that a blender typically makes: the blender will spin slowly in response to a user’s low-pitched growl, and increase in speed as the user makes higher-pitched vocal sounds. Another example is VoiceDraw, a research system that enables digital drawing for individuals with limited motor abilities. VoiceDraw allows users to “paint” strokes on a digital canvas by modulating vowel sounds, which are mapped to brush directions. Modulating other paralinguistic features (e.g. the loudness of their voice) allows the user to control different features of the drawing, such as the thickness of the brush stroke. Other approaches include adopting non-verbal sounds to augment touch-based interfaces (e.g. on a mobile phone) to support new types of gestures that wouldn’t be possible with finger input alone.  Design challenges  Voice interfaces pose a substantial number of challenges for usability. In contrast to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), best practices for voice interface design are still emergent. = Discoverability = With purely audio-based interaction, voice user interfaces tend to suffer from low discoverability: it is difficult for users to understand the scope of a system’s capabilities. In order for the system to convey what is possible without a visual display, it would need to enumerate the available options, which can become tedious or infeasible. Low discoverability often results in users reporting confusion over what they are “allowed” to say, or a mismatch in expectations about the breadth of a system’s understanding. = Transcription = While speech recognition technology has improved considerably in recent years, voice user interfaces still suffer from parsing or transcription errors in which a user’s speech is not interpreted correctly. These errors tend to be especially prevalent when the speech content uses technical vocabulary (e.g. medical terminology) or unconventional spellings such as musical artist or song names. = Understanding = Effective system design to maximize conversational understanding remains an open area of research. Voice user interfaces that interpret and manage conversational state are challenging to design due to the inherent difficulty of integrating complex natural language processing tasks like coreference resolution, named-entity recognition, information retrieval, and dialog management. Most voice assistants today are capable of executing single commands very well but limited in their ability to manage dialogue beyond a narrow task or a couple turns in a conversation.  Future uses  Pocket-size devices, such as PDAs or mobile phones, currently rely on small buttons for user input. These are either built into the device or are part of a touch-screen interface, such as that of the Apple iPod Touch and iPhone Siri Application. Extensive button-pressing on devices with such small buttons can be tedious and inaccurate, so an easy-to-use, accurate, and reliable VUI would potentially be a major breakthrough in the ease of their use. Nonetheless, such a VUI would also benefit users of laptop- and desktop-sized computers, as well, as it would solve numerous problems currently associated with keyboard and mouse use, including repetitive-strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome and slow typing speed on the part of inexperienced keyboard users. Moreover, keyboard use typically entails either sitting or standing stationary in front of the connected display; by contrast, a VUI would free the user to be far more mobile, as speech input eliminates the need to look at a keyboard. Such developments could literally change the face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built under the desk's surface. Television remote controls and keypads on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated. Numerous challenges would have to be overcome, however, for such developments to occur. First, the VUI would have to be sophisticated enough to distinguish between input, such as commands, and background conversation; otherwise, false input would be registered and the connected device would behave erratically. A standard prompt, such as the famous \\"Computer!\\" call by characters in science fiction TV shows and films such as Star Trek, could activate the VUI and prepare it to receive further input by the same speaker. Conceivably, the VUI could also include a human- like representation: a voice or even an on-screen character, for instance, that responds back (e.g., \\"Yes, Vamshi?\\") and continues to communicate back and forth with the user in order to clarify the input received and ensure accuracy. Second, the VUI would have to work in concert with highly sophisticated software in order to accurately process and find/retrieve information or carry out an action as per the particular user's preferences. For instance, if Samantha prefers information from a particular newspaper, and if she prefers that the information be summarized in point-form, she might say, \\"Computer, find me some information about the flooding in southern China last night\\"; in response, the VUI that is familiar with her preferences would \\"find\\" facts about \\"flooding\\" in \\"southern China\\" from that source, convert it into point-form, and deliver it to her on screen and/or in voice form, complete with a citation. Therefore, accurate speech-recognition software, along with some degree of artificial intelligence on the part of the machine associated with the VUI, would be required.  Privacy implications  Privacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of voice-user interfaces in unencrypted form, and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner. Additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech, a user’s manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity, personality traits, body shape, physical and mental health condition, sex, gender, moods and emotions, socioeconomic status and geographical origin.

He was the son of the founder of Motorola, Paul Galvin, and served as the CEO of Motorola from 1959 to 1986. Motorola career Born in Marshfield, Wisconsin, Galvin went to work for Motorola in 1940. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1944.http://news.nd.edu/news/in-memoriam- robert-w-galvin-former-notre-dame-fellow-and-trustee/ In 1956 he was named the president of the company. Two years later he succeeded his father as a chief executive officer. In 1986, Bob Galvin gave up the title of CEO while remaining chairman of the board. Under his leadership, Motorola sales had grown from $216.6 million in 1958 to $6.7 billion in 1987 and cash flow per share had grown from 89 cents to $6.10. Bob Galvin also was instrumental, along with Dr. Mikel J Harry and Motorola engineer Bill Smith, in implementing the Six Sigma quality system at Motorola. As a result of the Six Sigma program, Motorola received the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1988, which is given by the President of the United States. Later, the Six Sigma processes subsequently were adopted at the General Electric Corporation. Jack Welch said: \\"Six Sigma changed the DNA of GE.\\"\\"A Brief History of Six Sigma[http://scm.ncsu.edu/scm-articles/article/six-sigma-where-is-it-now \\"Six Sigma: Where is it now?\\" Retrieved May 22, 2008.

Other initiatives In 2005, Galvin created the Galvin Electricity Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the electrical grid so that it meets with Six Sigma standards of quality. Along with his two sons Christopher and Michael, Galvin recently started a real estate investment firm, Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, named for the street where his father and uncle started Motorola (originally named \\"Galvin Manufacturing\\"). Awards Galvin was a longtime supporter of Illinois Institute of Technology and became a trustee in 1953. He served as chairman from 1979 to 1990 and sat on three steering bodies on the future of IIT, in 1975, 1985, and as chairman in 1993. At the time of his death, he served as a University Regent. In 1990, IIT presented Galvin with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, and in 1996, he received the university's Henry Heald Award. IIT dedicated the Paul V. Galvin Library in 1985 to recognize the Galvin family's commitment to the institution. In 1985, Galvin received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1991, Galvin was inducted into Junior Achievement's U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1993, he received the Bower Award in Business Leadership. In 2000 he was awarded the IEEE Founder's Medal for \\"For his distinguished leadership in promoting quality, technological excellence and' cooperation between government and the private sector, and expanding the applications of electronics and communications technology globally.\\" In 2005, he was awarded the Vannevar Bush Award for \\"his visionary leadership to enhance U.S. innovation, competitiveness, and excellence at the interface of science and technology with the Nation's industrial enterprise.

It is usually prepared by women over the course of several days, traditionally from néré (Parkia biglobosa) seeds. It can be made from other kinds of seeds, such as those of Prosopis africana, and the use of soybeans for this purpose is increasing due mainly to inadequate supply of néré seeds. It is comparable to miso paste. The fabrication process involves boiling, cleaning and then packing away to ferment - the fermentation process giving it a pungent smell. Salt can be added to the finished product to facilitate storage life. This condiment is traditionally sold in balls or patties that can be kept for several months at a time in the case of the best quality. It is a traditional ingredient used across West Africa. The traditional production now faces strong competition from low-quality stock cubes. Sumbala is rich in proteins and a variety of dietary minerals, which are completely absent from these bouillon cubes.

One such hypothesis is that the sunken ship was actually the Titanics near-identical sister-ship Olympic, which was the subject of a large insurance claim, and that the two vessels were secretly switched prior to the voyage. Another is that the Titanics owner, J.P. Morgan, wanted to eliminate several prominent bankers who were opposing his plan for the creation of a U.S. central bank. Accepted version The Titanic struck an iceberg, damaging the hull's plates in her starboard side causing her front compartments to flood below the water line. The ship then sank, causing about 1500 fatalities. Olympic exchange hypothesis One of the most controversial and elaborate theories surrounding the sinking of the Titanic was forwarded by Robin Gardiner in his book, Titanic: The Ship That Never Sank? Gardiner draws on several events and coincidences that occurred in the months, days, and hours leading up to the sinking of the Titanic, and concludes that the ship that sank was in fact Titanics sister ship , disguised as Titanic, as an insurance scam by her owners, the International Mercantile Marine Group, controlled by American financier J.P. Morgan that had acquired the White Star Line in 1902. Olympic (left) and Titanic (right) in Belfast on 2 March 1912 Olympic was the slightly older sister of Titanic, built alongside the more famous vessel but launched in October 1910. Her exterior profile was nearly identical to Titanic, save for minor details such as the number of portholes on the forward C decks of the ships, the spacing of the windows on the B decks, and the forward section of the A deck promenade on Titanic that had been enclosed only a few weeks before she set sail on her ill-fated maiden voyage. Both ships were built with linoleum floors, but shortly before she was due to set sail J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line, inexplicably ordered the floors aboard Titanic carpeted over. On 20 September 1911, the Olympic was involved in a collision with the Royal Navy Warship in the Brambles Channel in Southampton Water while under the command of a harbour pilot. The two ships were close enough to each other that Olympic motion drew the Hawke into her aft starboard side, causing extensive damage to the liner – both above and below her waterline (HMS Hawke was fitted with a reinforced 'ram' below the waterline, purposely designed to cause maximum damage to enemy ships). An Admiralty inquiry assigned blame to the Olympic, despite numerous eyewitness accounts to the contrary. Gardiner's theory plays out in this historical context. Olympic was found to be at blame in the collision (which, according to Gardiner, had damaged the central turbine's mountings and bent the keel, giving the ship a slight permanent list to port). Because of this finding, White Star's insurers Lloyd's of London allegedly refused to pay out on the claim. White Star's flagship would also be out of action during the extensive repairs, and the Titanics completion date, which was already behind schedule due to Olympics return to the yard after her loss of a propeller blade, would have to be delayed. All this would amount to a serious financial loss for the company. Gardiner proposes that, to make sure at least one vessel would be earning money, the badly damaged Olympic was patched up and then converted to become the Titanic. The real Titanic when complete would then quietly enter service as the Olympic. The Titanic indeed had a list to port leaving Southampton. Inadequate trimming of cargo and bunkers would likely result in such and the crew seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. A list to port was noted by several Titanic survivors including Lawrence Beesley who wrote in his book about the sinking: \\"I then called the attention of our table to the way the Titanic listed to port (I had noticed this before), and we watched the skyline through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon.\\" (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) This was echoed by survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: \\"However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up.\\" Gardiner states that few parts of either ship bore the name, other than the easily removed lifeboats, bell, compass binnacle, and name plates. Everything else was standard White Star issue and was interchangeable between the two ships, and other vessels in the White Star fleet. While all other White Star Line Ships had their names engraved into their hulls, the Titanic alone had her name riveted over the top. The Olympic had allegedly been damaged beyond economic repair. Gardiner suggests that the plan was to dispose of the Olympic in a way that would allow White Star to collect the full insured value of a brand new ship. He supposes that the seacocks were to be opened at sea to slowly flood the ship. If numerous ships were stationed nearby to take off the passengers, the shortage of lifeboats would not matter as the ship would sink slowly and the boats could make several trips to the rescuers. Gardiner points to the length of Titanics sea trials as evidence. Olympics trials in 1911 took two days, including several high speed runs, but Titanics trials reportedly only lasted for one day, with (Gardiner alleges) no working over half-speed. Gardiner says this was because the patched-up hull could not take any long periods of high speed. Perhaps this was due to the fact that Titanic as a nearly identical twin sister of the Olympic was expected to handle exactly the same, or perhaps the Board of Trade inspectors were in on the scheme. Gardiner maintains that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) was on the bridge because he was one of the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the Titanic did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the Titanic because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the Titanic. Gardiner further hypothesises that the ship that was hit by the Titanic was the one seen by the SS Californian firing distress rockets, and that this explains the perceived inaction of the Californian (which traditionally is seen as failing to come to the rescue of the Titanic after sighting its distress rockets). Gardiner's hypothesis is that the Californian, another IMM ship, was not expecting rockets but a rendezvous. The ice on the deck of the Titanic is explained by Gardiner as ice from the rigging of both the Titanic and the mystery ship she hit. As for the true Titanic, Gardiner alleges that she spent 25 years in service as the Olympic and was scrapped in 1935. Researchers Bruce Beveridge and Steve Hall took issue with many of Gardiner's claims in their book, Olympic and Titanic: The Truth Behind the Conspiracy. Author Mark Chirnside has also raised serious questions about the switch theory. Closed watertight doors Another theory involves Titanics watertight doors. This theory suggests that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled on an even keel and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No. 4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking.Hacket C. and Bedford, J.G. (1996). The Sinking of the S.S. Titanic – Investigated by Modern Techniques. The Northern Ireland Branch of the Institute of Marine Engineers and the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, 26 March 1996 and the Joint Meeting of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects and the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, 10 December 1996 Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision. Later, in a 1998 documentary titled Titanic: Secrets Revealed, the Discovery Channel ran model simulations which also rebutted this theory. The simulations indicated that opening Titanics watertight doors would have caused the ship to capsize earlier than she actually sank by more than one half hour, confirming the findings of Bedford and Hacket. Expansion joints hypothesis Breakup suspected by Long Titanic researchers continued to debate the causes and mechanics of the ships breakup. According to his book, A Night to Remember, Walter Lord described Titanic as assuming an \\"absolutely perpendicular\\" position shortly before its final plunge. This view remained largely unchallenged even after the wreck's discovery by Robert Ballard in 1985 confirmed that Titanic had broken in two pieces at or near the surface; paintings by noted marine artist Ken Marschall and in James Cameron's film Titanic, both of which depicted the ship attaining a steep angle prior to the breakup. Most researchers acknowledged that Titanics after expansion joint—designed to allow for flexing of the hull in a seaway—played little to no role in the ship's breakup, though debate continued as to whether the ship had broken from the top downwards or from the bottom upwards. In 2005, a History Channel expedition to the wreck site scrutinised two large sections of Titanics keel, which constituted the portion of the ship's bottom from immediately below the site of the break. With assistance from naval architect Roger Long, the team analysed the wreckage and developed a new break-up scenario which was publicised in the television documentary Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces in 2006. One hallmark of this new theory was the claim that Titanics angle at the time of the breakup was far less than had been commonly assumed—according to Long, no greater than 11°. Long also suspected that Titanics breakup may have begun with the premature failure of the ship's after expansion joint, and ultimately exacerbated the loss of life by causing Titanic to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on Titanics younger sister ship, , which verified that the design of Britannics expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the Titanic. To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary Titanic's Achilles Heel, partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that Titanics expansion joints were strong enough to deal with any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications. But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the strength deck (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder. Thus, the expansion joints had no meaning for the support of the hull. They played no role in the breaking of the hull. They simply opened up and parted as the hull flexed or broke beneath them. Brad Matsen's 2008 book Titanic's Last Secrets endorses the expansion joint theory. One common oversight is the fact that the collapse of the first funnel at a relatively shallow angle occurred when the forward expansion joint, over which several funnel stays crossed, opened as the hull was beginning to stress. The opening of the joint stretched and snapped the stays. The forward momentum of the ship as she took a sudden lurch forwards and downwards sent the unsupported funnel toppling onto the starboard bridge wing. One theory that would support the fracturing of the hull is that the Titanic partly grounded on the shelf of ice below the waterline as she collided with the iceberg, perhaps damaging the keel and underbelly. Later during the sinking, it was noticed that Boiler Room #4 flooded from below the floor grates rather than from over the top of the watertight bulkhead. This would be consistent with additional damage along the keel compromising the integrity of the hull.  Fire in coal bunker  A fire began in one of Titanic coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into her voyage.Titanic doomed by fire raging below decks, says new theory – The Independent. 12 April 2008. Retrieved 3 January 2017. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships due to spontaneous combustion of the coal. The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses, by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace.Titanic Research & Modeling Association: Coal Bunker Fire This event has led some authors to theorise that the fire exacerbated the effects of the iceberg collision, by reducing the structural integrity of the hull and a critical bulkhead.Huge fire ripped through Titanic before it struck iceberg, fresh evidence suggests – The Telegraph. 31 December 2016. Retrieved 3 January 2016Titanic sank due to enormous uncontrollable fire, not iceberg, claim experts – The Independent. 3 January 2016. Retrieved 3 January 2016. In 2011 David J H Smith put forward this idea in his book The Titanic's Mummy which looked at the event in a docudrama style. It was stated that the bunker fire was at the heart of the eventual disaster claiming that decisions made because of the blaze led it to a collision course with the iceberg. The book also looks at the fire's physical effect on the ship which claims it weakened the area of impact. Senan Molony has suggested that attempts to extinguish the fire – by shovelling burning coals into the engine furnaces – may have been the primary reason for the Titanic steaming at full speed prior to the collision, despite ice warnings.Titanic Disaster: New Theory Fingers Coal Fire – Geological Society of America. 11 November 2014.

Samuel Halpern has concluded that \\"the bunker fire would not have weakened the watertight bulkhead sufficiently to cause it to collapse.\\"Fire Down Below - by Samuel Halpern. Retrieved 7 January 2017. Also, it has been suggested that the coal bunker fire actually helped Titanic to last longer during the sinking and prevented the ship from rolling over to starboard after the impact, due to the subtle port list created by the moving of coal inside the ship prior to the encounter with the iceberg.Titanic's Guardian Angel – by Parks Stephenson.

It is produced and recorded at TheBlaze studios in Dallas, TX. The show originally ran on CNN Headline News from 2006 to 2008 (now HLN) and moved to the Fox News Channel in 2009. Beck's program departed Fox News on June 30, 2011 with Beck announcing the creation of an online only network, later to become TheBlaze, that would air his television show among other programming. In 2012, Beck commenced encouraging listeners to ask their cable or satellite television providers to carry the new network. Overview Each broadcast usually began with a brief, scripted monologue by Beck, in which he gave his analysis of the top story of the day. This was usually followed by an interview with a correspondent, who continued the discussion with his or her opinions on the matter. Although the original concept of the show combined elements of late-night talk shows (e.g., satirical comedy bits and frequent celebrity interviews) and cable news, it gradually came to center on the latter format and to use a more news-oriented style. Headline News era The Friday broadcasts were devoted to a full-hour interview under the label Honest Questions. People interviewed included Ron Paul, Al Sharpton, Janice Dickinson, Larry King, Nancy Grace, Benjamin Netanyahu, Anderson Cooper, Jeff Foxworthy, and Ben Stein. =Special programs= Special programming included Exposed: The Extremist Agenda, Exposed: The Climate of Fear, and a week-long series titled America's Addiction. These programs tended to be serious examinations of the subjects without any of Beck's humorous asides. Exposed: The Extremist Agenda The Extremist Agenda, a special about Islamic extremism, aired in November 2006. Exposed: The Climate of Fear The May 2, 2007 edition of his Glenn Beck on Headline News was a \\"special report\\" entitled, \\"Exposed: The Climate of Fear\\". In his opening remarks, Beck said, \\"Welcome to 'Exposed: The Climate of Fear.' I want you to know right up front, this is not a balanced look at global warming. It is the other side of the climate debate that you don't hear anywhere. Yes, Al Gore, there is another credible side.\\"Transcript of Exposed: The Climate of Fear Media Matters for America described it as \\"Glenn Beck's Climate of Distortion\\" which \\"rehashed several falsehoods and misleading talking points\\", including the claim that the so-called Oregon Petition had credibility. Exposed: America's Broke Beck aired a special called \\"Exposed: America's Broke\\" during the week on September 18, 2008. This special dealt with the national debt in America and what Beck saw as America's debt of leadership as well. Exposed: The End of Oil This last Exposed special hosted by Beck aired the week after America's Broke and focused on the economic effects of not using the resources in America (offshore drilling, ANWR oil, etc.) before the U.S. can find an alternative source of fuel. Fox News era Glenn Beck's self-titled television show on Fox News Channel premiered January 19, 2009, with his move resulting in a significant viewership increase.Big Beck: Goes over 3 million viewers, beats O'Reilly in demo: Cable News Ratings for Wednesday, August 26, 2009], TV by the numbers, August 27, 2009Glenn Beck Has #1 Cable News Show On Day Before Van Jones Resignation, mediaite.com, September 4, 2009.Cable News Ratings for Wednesday, December 16, 2009 TV by the numbers, December 17, 2009.

During the last episode, Beck recounted the accomplishments of the show and the topics it discussed. =Criticism of White House officials= Van Jones Van Jones resigned from his position as Special Advisor to the president in September 2009 after becoming a major subject of news stories on programs such as Glenn Beck, after lesser known conservative groups had first aired concerns as early as April.New York Times Embattled Van Jones Quits, but 'Czar' Debates Rage On By MICHAEL BURNHAM September 9, 2009Phil Kerpen, 6 September 2009, Fox News.com, How Van Jones Happened and What We Need to Do Next The early critics received coverage from Fox News,AlterNet, 8 September 2009, Big Business's Hidden Hand in the Smear Job on Van Jones notably from Fox commentator Glenn Beck, who featured Jones on 14 episodes of his show. They forced Van Jones in July and August 2009 to defend his past including membership in a socialist group and support for Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death row prisoner convicted of killing a police officer.Politico, 7 September 2009, Van Jones resigns amid controversy Editors credited Beck with his \\"first scalp\\", noting that the Huffington Post expressed continued support for Jones, singling out the efforts of Beck to force his resignation, though Beck was not the first to voice concerns about the appointment nor did he call for Jones' resignation.Huffington Post, 6 September 2009, Glenn Beck Gets First Scalp: Van Jones ResignsArianna Huffington, Huffington Post, September 7, 2009, \\"Thank You, Glenn Beck!\\"Glenn Beck Draws First Blood in Czar War Our Editors Pick the Best of What's Hot on the Web Web poll shows 86% support the resignation, and 75% support Glenn Beck Anita Dunn Anita Dunn, as interim White House Communications Director, made critical statements of Fox News. Following her statements, Beck aired a clip, from June 5, 2009, of Dunn giving a speech to high school students. She stated \\"two of my favorite political philosophers, Mao Zedong and Mother Teresa – not often coupled with each other – but the two people that I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point, which is, 'You're going to make choices, you're going to challenge, you're going to say, why not?, you're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before.\\" Beck was critical of Dunn as he questioned what he alleged was a pattern of communist sympathy.The Glenn Beck Program, Fox News Channel. October 18, 2009. Transcript at FoxNews.com. =ACORN= Within days of its premiere, Beck began using his program on Fox News to warn the public about the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). In September 2009, the website BigGovernment.com published heavily edited hidden-camera recordings, although the full video recordings were also made available, in which Hannah Giles posed as a prostitute and James O'Keefe posed as her boyfriend in order to elicit sympathy and responses from employees of ACORN. The day of their release, the videos were also aired on Glenn Beck. After the release of the first video, Beck began to devote large portions of his program to publicizing the alleged \\"underhanded dealings\\" of ACORN. The story immediately had a disparaging effect on the organization, with one reporter from the New York Times proclaiming that the videos \\"caught ACORN's low-level employees in five cities sounding eager to assist with tax evasion, human smuggling and child prostitution.\\" Politicians quickly distanced themselves from the organization, and within days both the United States House and Senate voted to exclude ACORN from federal funding, (although funding was later restored after the group had disbanded as a result of a court order finding that the Congressional action violated the U.S. Constitution's bill of attainder clause).http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30504.html On 13 August 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded on the grounds that only 10 percent of ACORN's funding was federal and that did not constitute \\"punishment\\".\\"Federal Court Rules Against Acorn\\". Associated Press: 14 August 2010. The organization was forced to disband amid the firestorm of controversy due to lack of funding.ACORN disbanding because of money woes, scandal; The Baltimore Sun; March 23, 2010 Subsequent independent investigations by multiple law enforcement agencies including state attorneys general and district attorneys determined that the ACORN workers had committed no criminal activity and that the videos were actually \\"heavily edited\\" to present material out of context and create a misleading impression of activities.An Independent Governance Assessment of ACORN , December 7, 2009\\"ACORN Workers Cleared Of Illegality By Outside Probe\\"\\"ACORN and the Ethics of Leadership\\", Atlantic Monthly, December 8, 2009ACORN Investigation Results , The Nonprofit Quarterly\\"Damaging Brooklyn ACORN Sting Video Ruled 'Heavily Edited' - No Charges to Be Filed\\", New York Magazine; March 2, 2010 =The Revolutionary Holocaust= On Friday, January 22, 2010, Beck produced his first documentary, The Revolutionary Holocaust: Live Free or Die.  Reception  Beck's shows have been described as a \\"mix of moral lessons, outrage and an apocalyptic view of the future ... capturing the feelings of an alienated class of Americans.\\" Beck has referred to himself as an entertainer, a rodeo clown, and identified with Howard Beale: \\"When he came out of the rain and he was like, none of this makes any sense. I am that guy.\\" Beck's style of expressing his candid opinions have helped make his shows successful, but have also resulted in protest and advertiser boycotts. In late July 2009, Beck argued that reparations and social justice were driving President Obama's agenda, discussing issues of diversity and institutional racism. That week in response to the Henry Gates controversy, Beck stated that Obama has repeatedly exposed himself as having, \\"a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white culture.\\" He concluded that, \\"I'm not saying he doesn't like white people. I'm saying he has a problem. This guy is, I believe, a racist.\\" These remarks drew criticism from MSNBC commentators, the NAACP, and resulted in as many as 80 advertisers boycotting both Beck's show and FNC. Beck later mentioned that he regretted calling Barack Obama a racist, saying that, \\"I have a big fat mouth sometimes\\". Time describes Beck as \\"the new populist superstar of Fox News\\" saying it is easier to see a set of attitudes rather than a specific ideology, noting his criticism of Wall Street, yet defending bonuses to AIG and denouncing conspiracies against FEMA but warning against indoctrination of children by the AmeriCorps program. Time concludes that \\"what unites Beck's disparate themes is a sense of siege\\" but notes that Beck describes his Glenn Beck Radio Program as \\"the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.\\" According to Nielsen ratings, Beck had one of the highest rated 5PM cable news shows as of March 2009, consistently beating his competition's combined total viewership.http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/08/25/cable-news-ratings-for-monday- august-24-2009/25374http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/ratings/ Beck was up 96% in 2009, from Fox's previous year 5 p.m. time slot.State of the News Media: 2009 Summary Essay Project for Excellence in Journalism However, the show's ratings for the month of January 2011 were 39% lower than their January 2010 number, representing the steepest decline of any cable news show. A significant factor in Beck's overall ratings drop is his viewership among the prized 25- to 54-year-old advertising demographic, which declined by almost one-half in 2010. = Boycotts = After Beck accused President Obama of being a racist, Color of Change, an online civil rights advocacy group, urged advertisers to boycott Beck's program.Bauder, David (August 24, 2009), \\"Attack on Obama riles Beck's advertisers\\", Yahoo News As of September 21, 2010, a total of 296 advertisers had asked that their commercials not be shown on Fox News during Beck's programming including Wal-Mart, CVS Caremark, Best Buy, Ally Financial, Travelocity, LexisNexis-owned Lawyers.com, Procter & Gamble, Verizon Wireless, HSBC, Progressive Corporation and GEICO.Brownworth, Victoria A. (August 20, 2009), \\"Woodstock Nation\\", Bay Area Reporter Fox News has also had a difficult time selling commercials on The O'Reilly Factor and Fox and Friends when Beck appears as a guest on those shows as well as other Fox News shows. In the TV sales world Beck's show has become known as \\"empty calories,\\" meaning that he draws great ratings, but he's toxic for ad sales. Fox issued a statement indicating that overall revenue had not been lost as a result of the boycott, as most companies had shifted to other Fox programs. UPS Stores has decided to temporarily stop advertising on Fox News as a whole. Beck said that he was unapologetic for the remark and stated that the President is not above criticism.Huff, Richard (July 29, 2009), \\"Fox News Channel pundit Glenn Beck defends his comments that President Barack Obama is a 'racist, Daily News (New York) =In pop culture= In the South Park episode \\"Dances with Smurfs,\\" Eric Cartman parodies Beck multiple times, particularly when Cartman repeatedly says, \\"I'm just asking questions,\\" a Glenn Beck catchphrase. His show's intro and set are similar to Beck's. On the November 16 show, Beck acknowledged the parody, noting the use of chalkboards, crying on TV and questioning the President, saying, \\"You haven't lived until South Park has done an entire episode on you.\\" TheBlaze era On December 15, 2011, Beck moved his family and TheBlaze TV broadcasting from New York City to a suburb of Dallas, Texas, Las Colinas.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality of Bamban is the southernmost gateway of the melting pot province of Tarlac in the Central Plain of Luzon in the Philippines. Being the southernmost town in the province, it has a common boundary with Mabalacat, Pampanga, and in the west, with Zambales. The boundary is defined by the Parua River, which is a source of irrigation water, food, and sand and gravel for infrastructure projects. The mountainous region situated in the western part comprises almost two-thirds of the total land area, which used to be within the US Military Reservations. Nestled in this part are the BLISS projects and to the north, the MAR settlement project, which when completely developed will be a source of livelihood and food supplies for Central Luzon. Bamban is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Tarlac City. History Long before settlers came, the place which was to become the town of Bamban, was a vast track of wild land extending eastward; and on the west side, composed of foothills and mountains lush with vegetation and tall trees extending deep into the Zambales ranges. The thick forest and mountains were then inhabited by the Aetas (locally known as Baluga), and the Zambal, both of whom subsisted only on fishing and native or wild animals which abounded in the place. Occasionally, daring traders from Pampanga and the Tagalog province, mostly enterprising Chinese, braved the wilderness to go northward to Capas and Tarlac. Before the advent of the Spanish era, small settlers came, attracted by the fertile land and the glittering silver of the river that cut through the mountain to spill down the flat land, making it fertile. The settlers started small clearings in the thick growth of bamban plants which covered vast portions of the land bordering the river a small distance from the foothills.(because of these plants, the place was eventually named Bamban). Settlers upon settlers came to carve clearings in the land, and soon a small community was formed. About 1700, Agustinian Recollects came and established the Mission de Pueblos de Bamban. But the pueblo was then a part of Pampanga. In 1837, a new boundary line was established, thereby permanently making Bamban part of the province of Tarlac. Official recognition as a town was sanctioned by the gobernadorcillo in the town of Tarlac. Don Martín Sibal was subsequently appointed head and commissioned with the rank of \\"Capitán\\". Among the first settlers were the Sibal, Lugtu, Dayrit, Macale, Vergara, Manipon, and de la Cruz clans. Children on roof of a school in Bamban, that was buried by lahars during the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. During the revolution of 1896, Bamban was one of the first towns to take up arms against the Spaniards. Northwest of the town situated among the hills are remnants of strongholds built by brave bands of Bambanenses who joined Gen. Servilliano Aquino in the uprising in Tarlac. Up to this time, a portion of the foothills in the area is called \\"Batiawan\\" or look-out point. Many a brave son died in this movement for liberation. When the Americans came in 1900, the small pueblo gradually grew into a teeming town. The Bamban Sugar Central was established and further gave impetus to its growth. Don Pablo Lagman was the first to be appointed presidente and Don Laureano Campo as vice-presidente under the American military government. Other prominent families then took over the helm of government. During the Commonwealth era, the Sibals, the Lumboys, the Santoses, the Punsalangs, to mention a few, enjoyed political power until the outbreak of World War II. Bamban was like the legendary phoenix, which locals felt must be resurrected from its ashes. The whole población was devastated and burned during the liberation. Undaunted, the people returned from hiding and began rebuilding even while the campaign was raging deep in the mountains. Growth was fast because of proximity of Clark Air Base. But Bamban can not be the same again. The aftermath of the war was felt for a long time. Consequently, prominent families left the town for the city to establish big business and names for themselves. The 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption and the subsequent flow of lava and mud to the lowlands of Bamban forced residents to move out or to stay at the Dapdap Resettlement Area, which is on higher grounds.

The town also consists of numerous subdivisions and exclusive villages. Capas is being dubbed as the “Tourism Capital of Tarlac”. Apart from being known as the final site of the infamous Bataan Death March, it is also known for Mount Pinatubo treks, where thousands of mountaineers and visitors go. The town has some industrial factories like the PilMiCo. Capas is a part of the Third Municipal district of Tarlac with Noel L. Villanueva as the present Third District Representative of Tarlac. History Originally a part of Zambales and Pampanga, its first settlers were the Kapampangan and the Aeta. It was founded in the year 1710 by the Augustinian Friars. During the American Colonial period, the Americans built the Camp O'Donell for military installation until when the Japanese used it as a concentration camp during the Bataan Death March as the last stop of the march. Capas as all other towns in Tarlac province was a part of vast wilderness inhabited by the Abelling tribes known as Aetas. The history of Capas dates back in the late 16th century when immigrants from Pampanga, Zambales, Pangasinan and the Ilocos region flock into the settlements. It is considered the oldest town in Tarlac. Capas became a pueblo (town) in 1710 beginning as a sleepy settlement at a place between Cutcut River in Sitio Pagbatuan and Gudya (present site) founded by Kapitan Mariano Capiendo. Capas' patron saint is San Nicolas de Tolentino. September 9–10 is the Capas Town Fiesta. Tarlac province was founded on May 28, 1874. In the course of time, the townspeople of Capas were ordered by the Spanish authorities to change their family name of their own choosing on condition such family names begin with letter “C”, the first letter of Capas. Descendants of the early inhabitants still hold to this day such family names as Capiendo, Capuno, Capitulo, Capule, Capunpun, Cayabyab, Castañeda and Catacutan. In the 1850s, Capas was a part of the western Pampanga Commandancia Militar de Tarlac which includes the town of Bamban, Concepcion, Victoria, O’Donnell, Murcia, Moriones, Florida Blanca, Porac, Mabalacat, and Magalang. O’Donnell (Patling) was then a bustling pueblo established by the Augustinians Recolletos Mission in the 1800s named in honor of Carlos O’Donnell y Abreu, the Spanish Minister of State who visited the Patling pueblo. O’Donnell was reverted as a barrio of Capas by the Philippine Commission of 1902 including Moriones reverted to Tarlac town and Murcia back to Concepcion. Capas is known in history as the site of the infamous death march concentration camp during World War II. Of the etymology of Capas, old folks believed it derived its name from a wild vine \\"Capas-capas\\" or it originated from a tree called Capas in the Aetas dialect, Bulak in Pampango or Capaz in Ilocano. The town has built the Capas National Shrine. It was built and is maintained by the Philippine government as a memorial to the Filipino and American soldiers who died in Camp O'Donnell at the end of the Bataan Death March, which totals to almost 70,000 soldiers and back-up civilians. This is a memorable site, for all Filipino and Americans veterans, that relate to Veterans Day in the Philippines. It was once a concentration camp subsequently serving as the burial grounds for thousands of Filipino and American soldiers who perished during World War II. The site was the ultimate destination point of the Bataan Death March involving Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered in Bataan on April 9, 1942. Camp O'Donnell was a facility of the United States Air Force in Capas, Tarlac, Philippines. Before the facility was transferred to the Philippine Air Force, it was first a Philippine Constabulary post then a United States Army facility. Another site, Santo Domingo Death March Marker, which is located in Capas were about 60,000 Filipino soldiers who were camped and eventually unloaded to start the second phase of the Death March. =Conversion to cityhood= With more than 100,000 populace, an area that is good enough for a city and an income close to ₱250,000,000 becoming a city is not impossible according to Rodriguez. Enshrouding more than 53 percent of this town's land area, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has included the municipality of Capas in the design of their Master Plan that is now in process, according to re-elected Mayor Antonio “TJ” Rodriguez. Rodriguez bared this during his inaugural speech at the oath-taking ceremony of newly elected and re-elected municipal officials held at the Multi-Purpose Hall here Monday morning. TJ said BCDA claims control of the more than 19,900 hectares as a military reservation, where three of their barangays—Santa Juliana, Maruglu and Bueno—were included, while barangays Sta Lucia, Aranguren, Lawy, and O’Donnell were partly taken. Being included in BCDA's master plan to make Capas a ‘Green City’ soon, TJ said that this town will become the most beautiful and progressive city in the country with the assurance of preserving the environment. However, with the forthcoming development, the controversy about the land where some Capasenos built their houses a long time ago is still a big issue. Rodriguez, however, vowed that he is with his constituents’ side in fighting for their rights over the land where their dwellings are constructed. He revealed that as early as June 2011, he already wrote a letter to President Benigno Aquino III, requesting the delineation and redistribution of 5,000 hectares of the BCDA area where his constituents resided. He said he would continue to consult with the stakeholders who will be affected by the BCDA's master plan. TJ assured Capasenos that with the new set of Sangguniang Bayan members headed by his party mate, Vice Mayor Roseller “Boots” Rodriguez, their vision towards the New Capas or Bayung Capas would be swiftly attained through their full cooperation and coordination with each other. During the occasion, the mayor enumerated his accomplishments during his first term, announcing the ₱65 million increase of budget from ₱180 million in 2010 to ₱215 million in 2012. He said his administration is intending to generate more revenues to finance more projects and programs in health, agriculture, housing, infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and other services. =Development of New Clark City= New Clark City Sports Complex New Clark City ground broke in 2016 and is envisioned as a Business Contingency Hub of the National Government where it serves as a backup office should Metro Manila experience emergencies such as earthquakes, floods, and other calamities.

According to the , it has a population of people. History The early history of La Paz is unclear. Legends state that there was an old pueblo called \\"Cama Juan\\" situated along the bank of the Chico River, bordering the province of Tarlac and Nueva Ecija. When the Chico River overflowed during a storm, a great flood swept the entire pueblo during the night. The flood is said to have devastated the area, claiming many lives. This forced the inhabitants of \\"Cama Juan\\" to evacuate. The old site (Cama Juan) is known as \\"Balen Melakwan\\" or \\"Abandoned Town\\". The inhabitants chose a field of evergreen grass and shrubbery on which to rebuild, which they named \\"Matayumtayum\\". Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Francisco Macabulos and Captain Mariano Ignacio selected a more centrally located site for the future town to be known as La Paz. This existed only as a barrio of the town of Tarlac until 1892, when it was separated from the latter and rechristened in honor of its patron saint Nuestra Senora de La Paz y Buen Viaje. Its emergence as a new town gave its citizens a chance to run their own government with Martin Aquino as the first Governadorcillo. La Paz was made the first seat of the revolutionary government of the province of Tarlac during the Spanish regime with Gen. Francisco Makabulos as its first provincial governor. Geography La Paz lies in the southeast portion of the province of Tarlac, from Metro Manila, from the provincial capital (Tarlac City) and from the regional center (San Fernando City aka San Fernando, Pampanga). It is bounded on the north by the town of Victoria, on the east by the Province of Nueva Ecija, on the south by the town of Concepcion and on the west by Tarlac City.

The fishery sector, once a vibrant source of food and income needs rehabilitation after the onslaught of lahar flows resulting from the Mount Pinatubo eruption. There is a growing retail and service sector in the poblacion along the national highway. Light industries are yet to evolve in the municipality to generate much needed employment. Ilocano, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are commonly spoken, with Tagalog and English as official languages used for secondary education, business and governance. Moncada is from Manila and is from the provincial capital, Tarlac City. It is accessible via the MacArthur Highway, and from Manila via the NLEX (North Luzon Expressway) and TPLEX (Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway). History Moncada did not come from the word \\"Muscada\\" but was copied from a town in Spain, Montcada during the Spanish era. Later on became, Moncada. The original settlers in the area are the Pangasinenses followed by the Ilocanos were migrants from the Ilocos region, who cleared the land and planted a certain type of tobacco known as \\"Muskada\\". The name of the place was originally derived from the crop grown and later rephrased to Moncada, in honor of a Spanish nobility. In the early 19th century, a revolutionary hero Don Silvino Lopez and his wife Magdalena Espejo Lopez became prime movers of development and progress in the new municipality, along with the Morales, Obillo, Cuchapin, Atencio, Marzan, Gamundoy, Caparas and Santo Domingo families among others. The Chinese community led by the Lao and Co families likewise contributed significantly to the economic development and welfare of the community in later years. During World War 2, the town produced war heroes: Captain Ablang of the Philippine Scouts who was killed in action, Macario Peralta who was elected Senator and served as defense secretary, and Antonio E. Lopez popularly known as \\"Kamote\\", who defeated an Aquino-Cojuangco candidate for the post of Tarlac governor in the 1949 election. The golden age of Moncada is best remembered during this period, after the war to the late 1960s, when debutantes and guests from Manila and beyond, along with the townspeople would congregate at the town plaza to celebrate various festivals and events. Life then was not much of a struggle and food came in plenty. Local leaders serve at the pleasure of the electorates, who had utmost regard for \\"delicadeza\\" and opportunities were made available to those who work for it. The struggle against the authoritarian regime realigned the political forces in Tarlac by the early 1980s, with a young maverick of the Lopez-Roy political clan by the name of Manny S.D. Lopez, shifting support to the rival Aquino-Cojuangco political clan. In doing so, Moncada is credited as the first municipality in the regime controlled 1st district of Tarlac, to fight for the restoration of democracy and demand justice for the slain opposition leader Ninoy Aquino. The hope for a new beginning unfortunately was lost to decadent ways of less discerning electorates, who consequently were subjected to the quality of governance they deserve. An exodus of bright minds sought and served ideals in other sectors and foreign lands. Moncada is at the northern part of Paniqui.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is the birthplace of the 11th President of the Philippines, Corazon C. Aquino. Etymology Paniqui is a Hispanized term derived from the Ilocano word \\"pampaniki\\" which means \\"bat\\", since the town has a feature of caves that house a population of bats. History The birth of Paniqui could be traced way back in 1712 when the provincial government of Pangasinan sent a group of men south of Bayambang, Pangasinan for the expansion of the Christian faith. The pioneering group was led by two brothers, Raymundo and Manuel Paragas of Dagupan and established the Local Government in a Sitio called \\"manggang marikit\\" (mango of an unmarried woman) now part of Guimba, Nueva Ecija. Surprisingly, in this sitio, there is a great number of mammals called by Ilocanos \\"pampaniki\\" and it was from this term that the name Paniqui was derived. An uprising led by Caragay during the early part of 1720 forced the Local Government in \\"manggang marikit\\" to abandon the place and to evacuate for lowland called Acocolao, a place two kilometers west of the present Poblacion. It was a historical sitio where the first Filipino Moro, Sultan Ali Mudin, was baptized in 1750. Paniqui was a sprawling town that covered a wide area that time. Some of the barrios that formerly comprised Paniqui were \\"San Roque\\", now Cuyapo; \\"Barong\\", now Gerona; \\"San Jose De Camiling\\", now Camiling; \\"Bani\\", now Ramos; \\"San Ramon\\", now Moncada; and Anao. The period between 1750 and 1896 were painful years of Spanish tyranny and oppression because the insurrectos and sometimes bandits, who are conveniently sprouted among the people, made sporadic attacks upon the conquistadores. These attacks on the Spaniards, who came on the islands bringing the sword and the cross, were marred by cholera and smallpox epidemics punctuated by floods and typhoons. However, a group of Paniqui patriots, welded together by a common belief of oneness, unselfish devotion for freedom and who are spurred by ruthless Spanish tyranny, organized a legitimate segment of the Katipunan on January 12, 1896, which is far cry from the bandits that used to harass the Spaniards. These dauntless men made daring exploits, unrecorded in the history of the Katipunan, the most prominent of which was the ambuscade of Spanish soldiers along the road going to Anao and killing a great number of them. These incidents made a prelude to the end of the Spanish occupation in Paniqui. The advent of American occupation saw a happy transition from the almost aristocratic and enigmatic characteristic of Spanish conquistadores to the democratic way of life under American tutelage. Geography Paniqui is situated between the towns of Gerona in the south, Moncada in the north, Anao and Ramos in the west while Camiling and Santa Ignacia are to its east. The town was originally part of the province of Pangasinan. It is first known as Manggang Marikit, a sitio of Pangasinan, in 1571 and as Pampaniki in 1686. Paniqui is from the nation's capital Manila and is from the provincial capital, Tarlac City. =Barangays= Paniqui is politically subdivided into 35 barangays. =Climate= Demographics Paniqui Town Hall In the , the population of Paniqui, Tarlac, was people, with a density of . =Language= The languages predominantly spoken by locals are Ilocano and Kapampangan, but Tagalog (as with most towns and cities in Luzon) and Pangasinan are also used frequently; however, where the older generation will use Ilocano to converse with each other, Tagalog is also being used more and more by the younger generation along with their mother languages. This is perhaps due to the influence of education, migration (especially to find work), television and mobile communications, which is extending the reach of previously localized peer groups.

It is the only national natural areas program that identifies and recognizes the best examples of biological and geological features in both public and private ownership. The program was established on May 18, 1962, by United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall. The program aims to encourage and support voluntary preservation of sites that illustrate the geological and ecological history of the United States. It also hopes to strengthen the public's appreciation of the country's natural heritage. As of November 2016, 599 sites have been added to the National Registry of National Landmarks. The registry includes nationally significant geological and ecological features in 48 states, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The National Park Service administers the NNL Program and if requested, assists NNL owners and managers with the conservation of these important sites. Land acquisition by the federal government is not a goal of this program. National Natural Landmarks are nationally significant sites owned by a variety of land stewards, and their participation in this federal program is voluntary. The legislative authority for the National Natural Landmarks Program stems from the Historic Sites Act of August 21, 1935 (49 Stat. 666, 16 U.S.C. 641); the program is governed by federal regulations.\\"National Natural Landmarks Program; Final Rule 36 CFR 62,\\" Federal Register Vol. 64, No. 91, Wednesday, May 12, 1999, pp. 25708-25723. The NNL Program does not have the protection features of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Thus, designation of a National Natural Landmark presently constitutes only an agreement with the owner to preserve, insofar as possible, the significant natural values of the site or area. Administration and preservation of National Natural Landmarks is solely the owner's responsibility. Either party may terminate the agreement after they notify the other.  Designation  The NNL designation is made by the Secretary of the Interior after in-depth scientific study of a potential site. All new designations must have owner concurrence. The selection process is rigorous: to be considered for NNL status, a site must be one of the best examples of a natural region's characteristic biotic or geologic features. Since establishment of the NNL program, a multi-step process has been used to designate a site for NNL status. Since 1970, the following steps have constituted the process. #A natural area inventory of a natural region is completed to identify the most promising sites. #After landowners are notified that the site is being considered for NNL status, a detailed onsite evaluation is conducted by scientists other than those who conducted the inventory.This step was dropped after 1979 but was reinstituted in 1999. #The evaluation report is peer reviewed by other experts to assure its soundness. #The report is reviewed further by National Park Service staff. #The site is reviewed by the Secretary of the Interior's National Park Advisory Board to determine that the site qualifies as an NNL. #The findings are provided to the Secretary of the Interior who approves or declines. #Landowners are notified a third time informing them that the site has been designated an NNL. Prospective sites for NNL designation are terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; geological features, exposures, and landforms that record active geological processes or portions of earth history; and fossil evidence of biological evolution. Each major natural history \\"theme\\" can be further subdivided into various sub-themes. For example, sub-themes suggested in 1972 for the overall theme \\"Lakes and ponds\\" included large deep lakes, large shallow lakes, lakes of complex shape, crater lakes, kettle lake and potholes, oxbow lakes, dune lakes, sphagnum-bog lakes, lakes fed by thermal streams, tundra lakes and ponds, swamps and marshy areas, sinkhole lakes, unusually productive lakes, and lakes of high productivity and high clarity.  Ownership  The NNL program does not require designated properties to be owned by public entities. Lands under almost all forms of ownership or administration have been designated—federal, state, local, municipal and private. Federal lands with NNLs include those administered by the National Park Service, National Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, Air Force, Marine Corps, Army Corps of Engineers, Navy, and others. Some NNL have been designated on lands held by Native Americans or tribes. NNLs also have been designated on state lands that cover a variety of types and management, as forest, park, game refuge, recreation area, and preserve. Private lands with NNLs include those owned by universities, museums, scientific societies, conservation organizations, land trusts, commercial interests, and private individuals. Approximately 52% of NNLs are administered by public agencies, more than 30% are entirely privately owned, and the remaining 18% are owned or administered by a mixture of public agencies and private owners.  Access  Participation in the NNL Program carries no requirements regarding public access. The NNL registry includes many sites of national significance that are open for public tours, but others are not. Since many NNLs are located on federal and state property, permission to visit is often unnecessary. Some private property may be open to public visitation or just require permission from the site manager. On the other hand, some NNL private landowners desire no visitors whatever and might even prosecute trespassers. The reasons for this viewpoint vary: potential property damage or liability, fragile or dangerous resources, and desire for solitude or no publicity.  Property status  NNL designation is an agreement between the property owner and the federal government. NNL designation does not change ownership of the property nor induce any encumbrances on the property. NNL status does not transfer with changes in ownership. Participation in the NNL Program involves a voluntary commitment on the part of the landowner(s) to retain the integrity of their NNL property as it was when designated. If \\"major\\" habitat or landscape destruction is planned, participation in the NNL Program by a landowner would be ingenuous and meaningless. The federal action of designation imposes no new land use restrictions that were not in effect before the designation. It is conceivable that state or local governments on their own volition could initiate regulations or zoning that might apply to an NNL.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town of San Manuel is a typically rural community located at the northernmost horn of the Province of Tarlac. Ilocano, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are commonly spoken, with Tagalog and English as official languages used for secondary education, business and governance. The municipality is known for their Buridibud (kind of vegetable stew) festival. From Manila, the town is accessible via the MacArthur Highway, or via the NLEX (North Luzon Expressway) and TPLEX (Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway); it is the last town of Tarlac before entering the town of Rosales in the province of Pangasinan. History When the barrio of San Jose was separated from the town of Moncada to be proclaimed a sister municipality in 1909, they renamed it “San Manuel” in honor of their benefactor, Don Manuel de Leon. San Manuel was originally covered with dense forest, lakes and creeks. Wild animals roamed into the wilderness. Settlers from Zambales and Pangasinan and later those from the Ilocos region inhabited into the area to start a new life. The residents of this barrio then did not know which jurisdiction they belonged. There are four towns surrounding the area namely: Moncada in the south; Anao and Cuyapo in the east and Alcala in the north. Neither of these duly organized municipalities claimed the sprawling area. However, an incident in the barrio helped the people solved the “jurisdiction” problem. A man gathering bees fell from the tree and died. The people immediately reported the incident to the nearby localities but only the Moncada authorities came and investigated the incident. Spurred by the gestures of the people of that town, they joined and submitted themselves under their jurisdiction and finally became an integral part of Moncada.  Geography  The Provinces of Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija border it on the north and east respectively, while on the southern side are the municipalities of Anao and Moncada.

According to the , it has a population of people. The city was proclaimed as a highly urbanized city by the former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, but the decision was opposed by the provincial government.  History  Tarlac's first settlers came from Bacolor, Pampanga. They cleared the area, fertilised the soil, and then established their settlement here in 1788. This small community of settlers experienced rapid population growth, as settlers from Bataan, Pampanga and Zambales moved into the area. The Kapampangan language, which is the dialect ofPampanga, became the native language of this town. Roads and barrios were built over the following decades through hard work of its residents. Following the foundation of the province of Tarlac in 1872, Tarlac was designated as the capital of the new province. = Cityhood and present = On June 21, 1969, President Ferdinand Marcos signed and approved the Republic Act 5907, converting this municipality into a city. However, its plebiscite was unsuccessful, showing their voters rejected cityhood. On April 21, 1990, the barangays of Burgos, David, Iba, Labney, Lawacamulag, Lubigan, Maamot, Mababanaba, Moriones, Pao, San Juan de Valdez, Sula, and Villa Aglipay, originally part of the then-municipality of Tarlac, separated and formed to be the part of San Jose. Tarlac now retains its 274.66 km² (106.05 sq mi) area. Finally, on March 12, 1998, Republic Act 8593 was signed by President Fidel V. Ramos, making Tarlac as the component city of the province of Tarlac. On April 18, 1998, its residents approved the conversion of the municipality into a city. Tarlac was proclaimed as the component city by COMELEC on the next day, on April 19, 1998. On October 27, 2005, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed the Proclamation No. 940, making Tarlac City into a highly urbanized city in the province. However, the provincial government opposed the city's campaign for conversion into HUC. The majority of voters rejected the conversion in the plebiscite on February 11, 2006.

History  The establishment of Victoria as a community may be traced back in the mid 1800s when the Spanish regime started to expand north from Manila. It almost happened at the same time when Porac and Floridablanca (now part of Pampanga) and Tarlac (now Tarlac City) were formed. In the mid 1800s people started to settle around the swamp or wetland in search for a place where food is abundant. By 1849 houses and pockets of communities were deriving subsistence from the wetland. The biggest sitio was Namitinan which became part of the earliest barrio formed in 1852 called San Vicente de Canarum. The name was derived from the wetland called Canarum Lake. Not until the signing of the decree by the Spanish Governor General Manuel Crespo on March 28, 1855, that the barrio San Vicente de Canarum was separated from Tarlac to form an independent pueblo named Victoria. The name was used to highlight the victorious battle of the faithful followers of Queen Isabela II of Spain over their European enemies. Traces of its Spanish history may still be seen in the well preserved municipal building, several old houses depicting Spanish architecture and various edifices that were built more than a hundred years ago.

Its mandate is to process claims and pay compensation for losses and damage suffered as a direct result of Iraq's 1990–1991 invasion and occupation of Kuwait which started the Gulf War. These losses included claims for loss of property, deaths, loss of natural resources, damage to public health and environmental damage. At the first meeting in August 1991, six categories of claims were set up: claims from individuals forced to flee Kuwait between the invasion and the cease fire (Category A); claims from individuals who (or whose family) suffered injuries or death as a result of the invasion (B); claims from individuals for business losses, pain and anguish, property damage etc. less than $100,000 (C); claims from individuals for business losses, pain and anguish, property damage etc. more than $100,000 (D); claims from corporations and other entities for business (including oil sector) losses (E); and governmental and international agency claims for cost of resettling and providing relief to citizens, claims for damage to government property and to the environment (F). Category E and F claims were further broken down to subcategories. Each claim category had specific dates for initiating the claim and providing required evidence. A total of over $350 billion in claims was submitted in 2,686,131 claims. Of these claims, 1,543,619 (57%) resulted in some sort of award. The total awarded, to be paid by Iraq from oil revenues, was just over $52 billion. As of April 2013 approximately $41.2 billion of this total had been paid to claimants, with approximately $11.2 billion remaining to be paid. The UNCC adopted a policy of paying individuals first, with the result that the remaining sum is owed entirely to a government entity, specifically the state oil company of Kuwait. The UNCC is making payments at approximately $1 billion per quarter, depending on the extent of Iraq's oil revenue. Copies of all major decisions and major evidence in support of claims can be found at the UNCC website.http://www.uncc.ch/ The process of assessing and awarding claims was begun during the period of Saddam Hussein's stewardship of Iraq. However, many of the claims (especially major claims) were not settled until after a new government was in place in Iraq. Efforts by the Paris Club (an organisation set up by the world's industrialised nations during the 1950s to restructure debt from severely indebted nations) to seek debt forgiveness in order to allow Iraq to use its oil revenues for reconstruction met with some success among wealthy nations with the notable exceptions of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Some entities have suggested the concept of odious debt, under which a country should not be held responsible for debt incurred by despotic regime for the purposes of strengthening itself and suppressing internal dissent.  Process issues  From the beginning of its operation, the UNCC system has been criticized for the lack of representation allowed to Iraq, the defendant government, in the process. In particular no money from Iraq sales of oil was allowed to be used for Iraq's legal defence.M.E. Schneider, \\"How Fair and Efficient is the UNCC System ? A Model to Emulate?\\", Journal of International Arbitration, Kluwer Law International, 15(1), 1998  Environmental damage  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia suffered gross environmental damage as a result of the Iraqi occupation, as the retreating Iraqi forces blew up oil wells and released millions of barrels (estimated as high as 11 million barrels) of crude oil into the Persian Gulf. In Kuwait the damage to the environment was largely terrestrial in the form of tarcrete and oil lakes surrounding the damaged wells. In 2001 the UNCC awarded Kuwait $108 million (the money to be taken from the Oil-for-Food Programme) to study the effects of the environmental devastation to the desert and the coastline, and the effects of the oil fires on public health. Most of Kuwait's desert is in fact sparse shrubland and capable of sustaining sheep, goats and camels. Little damage was found to Kuwait's shoreline and fishing industry. As a result of these studies claims were prepared for several billion dollars' worth of damages to the desert ecosystem resulting from the oil fires, uncontrolled oil releases, and military maneuvers by both Iraqi forces and coalition military. In contrast, the Saudi study (funded with $109 million from the Oil-for-Food Programme via the UNCC) found damage mostly to the coastline. The anti-clockwise current pattern of the Persian Gulf forced the floating spill onto the Saudi coastline and fouled approximately 800 km (250 km as the crow flies) of almost pristine shoreline. Commercial fish stocks (shrimp and fin fish) plummeted but recovered within a few years. An extensive and very detailed study of the shoreline was conducted at 250-meter intervals for the entire affected length, from the high-water mark to low water, to determine the extent of the contamination and its effect on biota. The Saudis claimed several billion dollars to compensate for these environmental damages.

Charles Howard was the eldest son of Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle, and inherited his title on the death of his father in 1692. He married in 1683 Lady Anne de Vere Capell, daughter of Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex. He was elected as MP for Morpeth in 1689. He was appointed Governor of Carlisle from 1693 to 1728 and Lord-Lieutenant of Cumberland and of Westmorland from 1694–1714. William III made him a Gentleman of the Bedchamber between 1700 and 1702, First Lord of the Treasury from 1701 to 1702 and Privy Counsellor in 1701. He acted as Earl Marshal between 1701 and 1706 because his cousin, the Duke of Norfolk, was a minor. On Anne, Queen of Great Britain's death on 1 August 1714 he was appointed Lord Justice of the Realm until the arrival of King George I of Great Britain on 18 September 1714. The new king reappointed him as First Lord of the Treasury from 23 May 1715 to 10 October 1715 and made him Constable of the Tower of London between 1715 and 1722. From 1699 to 1709 Carlisle was involved with the fraudulent schemes of pirate John Breholt. First Carlisle backed a plan to dive on and salvage a supposed wreck off Havana - Breholt even named his ship Carlisle - which came to naught, after which Breholt let slip that he intended to sail for Cape Verde and then to Madagascar to engage in outright piracy. A few years later Carlisle backed Breholt's plan (presented directly to Queen Anne) to pardon the pirates of Madagascar and have them return to England with their collected wealth. This scheme fell apart when Breholt's pirate past was exposed. In 1699 he commissioned a new Baroque mansion, Castle Howard, in Yorkshire, England to the design of Sir John Vanbrugh which is still occupied by his descendants. He died in Bath in 1738 and is buried in the mausoleum at Castle Howard. He had six children: * Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle (1693–1758) * General Hon.

In 1942, Tenney worked for the New York City-based Short Wave Research, a company contracted to the Office of War Information to recruit persons knowledgeable in foreign languages. In late summer of 1943, Tenney moved from New York to Washington, D.C. at the suggestion of Jacob Golos to obtain employment with the Spanish section of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). She moved into Mary Price's former apartment which was used as a meeting point for government employees engaged in espionage and their Soviet case handlers and couriers. Tenny began supplying reports and memoranda from OSS. This information included a considerable quantity of data on activities of OSS personnel in virtually all sections and all countries around the world. Tenney also supplied information concerning a monitoring station on Long Island. Beginning in 1944, Tenney was being paid a regular stipend of $50 per month — considerable for the times — which had been arranged through Joseph Katz. In December 1944, Joseph Gregg became Tenney's handler, however Tenney complained about his technique and Gregg was replaced by Inez Munoz. Tenney resigned from the OSS in June 1946 and transferred to the United States Department of State. By then the FBI had Tenney under surveillance. The State Department eased her out of her position and revoked her passport. In January 1947, Tenney had a nervous breakdown. She was confined to a psychiatric hospital for observation after a deadly combination of alcohol and phenobarbital which was regarded as a suicide attempt. Tenney remained unconscious for five days and upon regaining consciousness, was in a delirium and regarded as in a severe hallucinatory psychotic state. Her observers overheard Tenney mumbling about being followed, having her telephone tapped, having her friends under surveillance, and being a Russian spy. She then appeared to have a violent phobia against everything Russian, even the mention of the word \\"Russian\\", and was watched closely for another suicide attempt. Doctors, citing patient confidentiality, refused to discuss the case with FBI investigators. By February 1946, unbeknownst to Tenney, her contact with Soviet intelligence Elizabeth Bentley, had defected and was cooperating with the counterintelligence investigation. Bentley visited with Tenney and concluded that her suicide attempt was genuine; Tenney felt alone and isolated not knowing the larger Soviet espionage operation had been compromised and that the Soviet controllers had broken off contact with their American agents. Tenney was unremorseful and appeared to wish to reestablish contact with Soviet handlers, dashing the FBI's hopes to gain her cooperation. In June 1947, the FBI interviewed Tenney and determined she was in frail mental and physical health. In 1998, Tenney was identified in the Venona project transcripts as code name \\"Muse\\", based on her transfer from the dismantled OSS to the Department of State.

A speech recognition grammar is a set of word patterns, and tells a speech recognition system what to expect a human to say. For instance, if you call an auto-attendant application, it will prompt you for the name of a person (with the expectation that your call will be transferred to that person's phone). It will then start up a speech recognizer, giving it a speech recognition grammar. This grammar contains the names of the people in the auto attendant's directory and a collection of sentence patterns that are the typical responses from callers to the prompt. SRGS specifies two alternate but equivalent syntaxes, one based on XML, and one using augmented BNF format. In practice, the XML syntax is used more frequently. Both the ABNF and XML form have the expressive power of a context- free grammar. A grammar processor that does not support recursive grammars has the expressive power of a finite state machine or regular expression language. If the speech recognizer returned just a string containing the actual words spoken by the user, the voice application would have to do the tedious job of extracting the semantic meaning from those words. For this reason, SRGS grammars can be decorated with tag elements, which when executed, build up the semantic result. SRGS does not specify the contents of the tag elements: this is done in a companion W3C standard, Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR). SISR is based on ECMAScript, and ECMAScript statements inside the SRGS tags build up an ECMAScript semantic result object that is easy for the voice application to process. Both SRGS and SISR are W3C Recommendations, the final stage of the W3C standards track. The W3C VoiceXML standard, which defines how voice dialogs are specified, depends heavily on SRGS and SISR. Examples Here is an example of the augmented BNF of SRGS, as it could be used in an auto attendant application: #ABNF 1.0 ISO-8859-1; // Default grammar language is US English language en-US; // Single language attachment to tokens // Note that \\"fr-CA\\" (Canadian French) is applied to only // the word \\"oui\\" because of precedence rules $yes = yes  oui!fr-CA; // Single language attachment to an expansion $people1 = (Michel Tremblay  André Roy)!fr-CA; // Handling language-specific pronunciations of the same word // A capable speech recognizer will listen for Mexican Spanish and // US English pronunciations. $people2 = Jose!en-US  Jose!es-MX; /*Multi-lingual input possible * @example may I speak to André Roy * @example may I speak to Jose */ public $request = may I speak to ($people1  $people2); Here is the same SRGS example, using the XML form: yes oui Michel Tremblay André Roy Jose Jose may I speak to André Roy may I speak to Jose may I speak to See also * SISR * VoiceXML * Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS) * Natural Language Semantics Markup Language * JSGF External links * SRGS Specification (W3C Recommendation) * SISR Specification (W3C Recommendation) * VoiceXML Forum Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards Category:XML-based standards ","title":"Speech Recognition Grammar Specification"},{"id":"2144489","text":"Levels of the Game is a 1969 book by John McPhee, nominally about tennis and tennis players, but exploring deeper issues as well.

Heavy drinking led to his premature death at the age of fifty- eight.David Levin, Exemplary Elders (Athens GA, 1990) p. 36 \\"Perry Miller was a great historian of Puritanism but the dark conflicts of the Puritan mind eroded his own mental stability.\\" Niel Gunson, Telling Pacific lives: prisms of process (2008) p 8,14, Life Miller was born in Chicago, Illinois. He earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago and began teaching at Harvard University in 1931. In 1942, Miller resigned his post at Harvard to join the United States Army; he was stationed in Great Britain for the duration of the war, where he worked for the Office of Strategic Services. Miller may have been instrumental in creating the Psychological Warfare Branch of the O.S.S.; certainly he worked for the PWB for the duration of the war.Middlekauff, \\"Perry Miller,\\" pp 168-9 After 1945, Miller returned to teaching at Harvard. He also offered courses at the Harvard Extension School. Miller wrote book reviews and articles in The Nation and The American Scholar. In his long-awaited biography of Jonathan Edwards, published in 1949, Miller argues that Edwards was actually an artist working in the only medium available to him in the 18th century American frontier, namely that of religion and theology. His posthumously published The Life of the Mind in America, for which he received a Pulitzer Prize, was the first installment of a projected 10-volume series.Kelly Boyd, Encyclopedia of historians and historical writing: Volume 2 (1999) p. 818 Miller spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey on a Guggenheim Fellowship and also taught in Japan for a year. Death from alcoholism He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts of acute pancreatitis stemming from his longstanding alcohol use disorder.\\"...doctors had warned him several years earlier that alcohol gravely threatened his life...\\" Levin, Exemplary Elders, p.36 By some, especially within the Harvard community, his death was mourned as a loss to America's intellectual landscape.Alan Heimert, \\"Perry Miller: An Appreciation,\\" Harvard Review, II, no. 2 (Winter-Spring 1964), 30-48 Historiography Hollinger (1968) explores the philosophical basis of Miller's historiography, arguing that Miller's formulation of problems was controlled by tensions between 'conscious' and 'mechanical' and between 'understanding' and 'mystery.' For Miller, the mechanical world was devoid of morality and purpose, and was incompatible with conscious beauty and ethics. By contrast, within the 'conscious' realm the drive for knowledge about an intelligible universe controlled by laws vied with the opposite religious faith in an unknowable universe controlled by God. Miller's history was further deepened by his emphasis on development: he sees history as proceeding in a continuing series of interactions between traditional cultural forms and immediate environmental circumstances. For Miller, culture is never merely the product of the environment, but an active agent in the interaction. The search for 'historical knowledge' itself proceeds on the terms of this interaction. Miller rejected both positivism and the relativism of Carl Becker for the harder relativism later developed by Thomas Kuhn. That is, for Miller 'forms' are neither wholly arbitrary nor entirely discovered in 'the facts,' but are instead the inheritance and creation of the historian, altered and confirmed by his experience.David A. Hollinger, \\"Perry Miller and Philosophical History,\\" History and Theory, May 1968, Vol. 7 Issue 2, pp 189-202 Influence Miller's attempts to discover and to reveal the religious feelings and the religious ideas set a new standard for intellectual historiography.Stanford J.

In order, the letters, followed by the creatures for which the letters are the first letter when spelling their names, are YUZZ (Yuzz-a-ma-Tuzz), WUM (Wumbus), UM (Umbus), HUMPF (Humpf- Humpf-a-Dumpfer), FUDDLE (Miss Fuddle-dee-Duddle), GLIKK (Glikker), NUH (Nutches), SNEE (Sneedle), QUAN (Quandary), THNAD (Thnadners), SPAZZ (Spazzim), FLOOB (Floob-Boober-Bab-Boober-Bubs), ZATZ (Zatz-it), JOGG (Jogg- oons), FLUNN (Flunnel), ITCH (Itch-a-pods), YEKK (Yekko), VROO (Vrooms), and HI! (High Gargel-orum). The book ends with an unnamed letter that is substantially more complicated than those with names. A list of all the additional letters is shown at the end. Analysis Image of the imaginary letters in On Beyond Zebra! as rendered in the Constructium font. Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel's biographers, note that most of the letters resemble elaborate monograms, \\"perhaps in Old Persian\\".Morgan & Morgan, p. 152 These letters are not officially encoded in Unicode, but the independent ConScript Unicode Registry provides an unofficial assignment of code points in the Unicode Private Use Area for them. Legacy Some of the animals from On Beyond Zebra! appear in the 1975 CBS TV Special The Hoober-Bloob Highway. In this segment, Hoober-Bloob babies don't have to be humans if they don't choose to be, so Mr. Hoober-Bloob shows them a variety of different animals; including ones from On Beyond Zebra! and If I Ran the Zoo (1950). Such animals include: a Jogg-oon, a Sneedle, a Zatz-it, a Wumbus, and a Yekko.

The entrance to the neighborhood is marked by the Cooper-Young Trestle, a long steel sculpture which depicts homes and businesses found in the neighborhood. Created by metal artist Jill Turman, the sculpture was dedicated in 2000, and has become a source of community pride and identity. In 2012, Cooper-Young was listed on the American Planning Association's 10 Great Neighborhoods in the U.S list. Economy The neighborhood is known for its eclectic mix of shops, bars and restaurants. Java Cabana, Cooper-Young's coffeehouse, was once host to the Elvis Impersonator shrine, as well as the Viva Wedding Chapel, where hundreds of people were once married in the backroom by Elvis impersonators. Other restaurants such as Cafe Ole, Tsunami, Soul Fish, Cafe Palladio, Celtic Crossing, Alchemy, Aldo's Pizza Pies, Sweet Grass, Next Door, DKDC, The Beauty Shop, and Young Ave Deli represent diverse cuisines (sometimes several within one establishment) and reflect the creative spirit of the neighborhood. Also in Cooper Young, one will find The House of Mews (a shelter for homeless cats), Goner Records, a local record label, Jay Etkin Gallery and Burke's Book Store. The neighborhood is also home to the award-winning boutique chocolatier, Phillip Ashley Chocolates. Cooper Young is also where Memphis' only hostel, Pilgrim House Hostel, is located.Pilgrim House Cooper-Young Festival Each fall, the neighborhood hosts the Cooper-Young Festival, starting with an Art Invitational on Thursday, a 4-mile run on Friday, arts and crafts vendors, and live music performances on Saturday. The Cooper Young Festival is always the second Saturday after Labor Day each year from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. The neighborhood is considered one of the more artistic and \\"hip\\" areas of the city, and shows evidence of successful urban revitalization in Memphis' core. The Cooper Young Festival, hosted by the Cooper Young Business Association (CYBA), is a popular outdoor celebration in Memphis, Tennessee. It is one of Memphis' most highly attended festivals in Tennessee bringing in over 130,000 attendees and is continuing to grow. The festival is the largest single day event in the city where people pack into the neighborhood. It is free admission. 400 artisans from around the country go to sell their music, arts, and crafts along Cooper Street and Young Avenue. The festival came about in 1977 when a group of 500 residents from the area organized and decided to have it. November 5, 1977 was the date of the first festival. It was a community flea market with a stage and playground activities in the parking lot of Galloway United Methodist Church. It turned into a three-day festival called Cooper Young Business Association Street Fair. Starting with 7,000 visitors, the festival grew to entertaining 100,000 visitors. Every year the festival is kicked off with a neighborhood art invitational. An artist from the Cooper Young neighborhood designs a poster to represent the unique style of the Cooper Young area. Bands are brought in to perform on three stages over the weekend. Community The Cooper-Young Community Association, founded in 1976, serves as the main advocate for the residents of the area and produces a monthly neighborhood newspaper, The Lamplighter, to communicate neighborhood and city news. The CYCA also sponsors the Festival 4-Miler race - a 4-mile race through the neighborhood the night before the Cooper-Young Festival. The Cooper-Young Business Association serves as the primary advocate for the businesses and services of the neighborhood, and produces the Cooper-Young Festival along with other events to help draw attention to those businesses.

The motion picture was filmed on location throughout New York City and culminated in one of the first modern car chases, before 1968's Bullitt. Part of the story is set in the vicinity of the long-demolished Third Avenue El, a favorite location of the few films made in the city during that era. The cast features Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell for the second and last time; their earlier film was the noted noir They Live By Night (1948). Plot Joe Norson (Granger) lives with his wife and her parents in New York City; he has lost his gas station and found work as a part-time mail carrier. Because he wants the best for his expectant wife Ellen (O'Donnell), Joe rationalizes stealing what he thinks is $200 from a lawyer's office on his route. He discovers that he's actually stolen $30,000 from Victor Backett (Edmon Ryan), a corrupt attorney. Backett has framed wealthy broker/patsy Emil Lorrison (Paul Harvey) in a sex scandal, then extorted the money from him with the help of Lucille \\"Lucky\\" Colner (Adele Jergens) and ex-con and accomplice Georgie Garsell (James Craig). From the start, Joe begins to panic. He explains his newfound wealth to Ellen as a lucrative out-of-town job, then disguises the money as a package and leaves it with bartender Nick Drumman (Ed Max). In the meantime Lucille's body is found in the East River, strangled, and Captain Walter Anderson (Paul Kelly) of the New York Police Department investigates the murder. Both Lorrison and Backett are interviewed, their names having been found in Lucille's \\"love diary.\\" After the birth of his child, Joe decides to try to return his ill-gotten gain, but Backett suspects a trap and refuses the offer. Backett instead sends Garsell and a taxi driver to grab Joe and recover the cash. Joe is able to escape after they discover that Drumman has substituted a nightgown in the package and gone into hiding with the money. Joe looks for Drumman, but Garsell finds the bartender first, strangles him, and recovers the money. Joe confesses the original theft to Ellen, who urges him to turn himself in, but he finds himself a suspect in Drumman's murder. He tries to track down the source of the money to clear himself, even as Captain Anderson methodically pursues both men as suspects: Garsell for Lucille and Joe for Drumman. Joe locates Garsell's girlfriend, singer Harriet Sinton (Jean Hagen), but she betrays him to Garsell. Garsell plans to murder Joe and strangles Harriet to eliminate her as a witness. Captain Anderson is hot on their heels and a chase ensues through the early morning streets of New York. Garsell kills his partner and forces Joe to drive, but Joe deliberately crashes the taxi to end the nightmare. When Garsell tries to run out of the car, he is shot by the police and killed. Joe is carried out of the car by the police and taken into the ambulance. Ellen arrives just before he leaves for the hospital, and they embrace. Joe survives the accident; the police are able to learn the truth, so he is cleared.

Toxaphene is a mixture of over 670 different chemicals and is produced by reacting chlorine gas with camphene. It can be most commonly found as a yellow to amber waxy solid. Toxaphene was banned in the United States in 1990 and was banned globally by the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. It is a very persistent chemical that can remain in the environment for 1–14 years without degrading, particularly in the soil. Testing performed on animals, mostly rats and mice, has demonstrated that toxaphene is harmful to animals. Exposure to toxaphene has proven to stimulate the central nervous system, as well as induce morphological changes in the thyroid, liver, and kidneys. Toxaphene has been shown to cause adverse health effects in humans. The main sources of exposure are through food, drinking water, breathing contaminated air, and direct contact with contaminated soil. Exposure to high levels of toxaphene can cause damage to the lungs, nervous system, liver, kidneys, and in extreme cases, may even cause death. It is thought to be a potential carcinogen in humans, though this has not yet been proven. Composition Toxaphene is a synthetic organic mixture composed of over 670 chemicals, formed by the chlorination of camphene (C10H16) to an overall chlorine content of 67–69% by weight.Buntin, G.A. , 1951. The bulk of the compounds (mostly chlorobornanes, chlorocamphenes, and other bicyclic chloroorganic compounds) found in toxaphene have chemical formulas ranging from C10H11Cl5 to C10H6Cl12, with a mean formula of C10H10Cl8. The formula weights of these compounds range from 308 to 551 grams/mole; the theoretical mean formula has a value of 414 grams/mole. Toxaphene is usually seen as a yellow to amber waxy solid with a piney odor. It is highly insoluble in water but freely soluble in aromatic hydrocarbons and readily soluble in aliphatic organic solvents. It is stable at room temperature and pressure. It is volatile enough to be transported for long distances through the atmosphere. Applications Toxaphene was primarily used as a pesticide for cotton in the southern United States during the late 1960s and 1970s. It was also used on corn, small grains, vegetables, and soybeans to control ectoparasites such as lice, flies, ticks, mange, and scam mites on livestock. In some cases it was used to kill undesirable fish species in lakes and streams. The breakdown of usage can be summarized: 85% on cotton, 7% to control insect pests on livestock and poultry, 5% on other field crops, 3% on soybeans, and less than 1% on sorghum. The first recorded usage of toxaphene was in 1966 in the United States, and by the early to mid 1970s, toxaphene was the United States' most heavily used pesticide. Over 34 million pounds of toxaphene were used annually from 1966 to 1976. As a result of Environmental Protection Agency restrictions, annual toxaphene usage fell to 6.6 million pounds in 1982. In 1990, the EPA banned all usage of toxaphene in the United States. Toxaphene is still used in countries outside the United States but much of this usage has been undocumented. Between 1970 and 1995, global usage of toxaphene was estimated to be 670 million kilograms (1.5 billion pounds). Production Toxaphene was first produced in the United States in 1947 although it was not heavily used until 1966. By 1975, toxaphene production reached its peak at 59.4 million pounds annually. Production decreased more than 90% from this value by 1982 due to Environmental Protection Agency restrictions. Overall, an estimated 234,000 metric tons (over 500 million pounds) have been produced in the United States. Between 25% and 35% of the toxaphene produced in the United States has been exported. There are currently 11 toxaphene suppliers worldwide. Environmental effects When released into the environment, toxaphene can be quite persistent and exists in the air, soil, and water. In water, it can evaporate easily and is fairly insoluble. Its solubility is 3 mg/L of water at 22 degrees Celsius. Toxaphene breaks down very slowly and has a half-life of up to 12 years in the soil. It is most commonly found in air, soil, and sediment found at the bottom of lakes or streams. It can also be present in many parts of the world where it was never used because toxaphene is able to evaporate and travel long distances through air currents. Toxaphene can eventually be degraded, through dechlorination, in the air using sunlight to break it down. The degradation of toxaphene usually occurs under aerobic conditions. The levels of toxaphene have decreased since its ban, however, due to its persistence can still be found in the environment today. Exposure The three main paths of exposure to toxaphene are ingestion, inhalation, and absorption. For humans, the main source of toxaphene exposure is through ingested seafood. When toxaphene enters the body, it usually accumulates in fatty tissues. It is broken down through dechlorination and oxidation in the liver, and the byproducts are eliminated through feces. People that live near an area that has high toxaphene contamination are at high risk to toxaphene exposure through inhalation of contaminated air or direct skin contact with contaminated soil or water. Eating large quantities of fish on a daily basis also increases susceptibility to toxaphene exposure. Finally, exposure is rare, yet possible through drinking water when contaminated by toxaphene runoff from the soil. However, toxaphene has been rarely seen at high levels in drinking water due to toxaphene's high levels of insolubility in water. Shellfish, algae, fish and marine mammals have all been shown to exhibit high levels of toxaphene. People in the Canadian Arctic, where a traditional diet consists of fish and marine animals, have been shown to consume ten times the accepted daily intake of toxaphene. Also, blubber from beluga whales in the Arctic were found to have unhealthy and toxic levels of toxaphene. Health effects = In humans = When inhaled or ingested, sufficient quantities of toxaphene can damage the lungs, nervous system, and kidneys, and may cause death. The major health effects of toxaphene involve central nervous system stimulation leading to convulsive seizures. The dose necessary to induce nonfatal convulsions in humans is about 10 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. Several deaths linked to toxaphene have been documented in which an unknown quantity of toxaphene was ingested intentionally or accidentally from food contamination. The deaths are attributed to respiratory failure resulting from seizures. Chronic inhalation exposure in humans results in reversible respiratory toxicity. A study conducted between 1954 and 1972 of male agricultural workers and agronomists exposed to toxaphene and other pesticides showed that there are higher proportions of bronchial carcinoma in the test group than in the unexposed general population. However, toxaphene may not have been the main pesticide responsible for tumor production. Tests on lab animals show that toxaphene causes liver and kidney cancer, so the EPA has classified it as a Group B2 carcinogen, meaning it is a probable human carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified it as a Group 2B carcinogen. Toxaphene can be detected in blood, urine, breast milk, and body tissues if a person has been exposed to high levels, but it is removed from the body quickly, so detection has to occur within several days of exposure. It is not known whether toxaphene can affect reproduction in humans. = In animals = Toxaphene was used to treat mange in cattle in California in the 1970s and there were reports of cattle deaths following the toxaphene treatment.Chancellor, John; Oliver, Don (1979-02-22). \\"Possible Toxaphene Cattle Poisoning\\". NBC News. Vanderbilt Television News Archive. http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=502980. Retrieved on 2008-02-08. Chronic oral exposure in animals affects the liver, the kidney, the spleen, the adrenal and thyroid glands, the central nervous system, and the immune system. Toxaphene stimulates the central nervous system by antagonizing neurons leading to hyperpolarization of neurons and increased neuronal activity.  Regulations  Toxaphene has been found on at least 68 of the 1,699 National Priorities List sites identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Toxaphene has been forbidden in Germany since 1980. Most uses of toxaphene were cancelled in the U.S. in 1982 with the exception of use on livestock in emergency situations, and for controlling insects on banana and pineapple crops in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All uses of toxaphene were cancelled in the U.S. in 1990. Toxaphene has been banned in 37 countries, including Austria, Belize, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, the EU, India, Ireland, Kenya, Korea, Mexico, Panama, Singapore, Thailand and Tonga. Its use has been severely restricted in 11 other countries, including Argentina, Columbia, Dominica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey, and Venezuela. In the Stockholm Convention on POPs, which came into effect on 17 May 2004, twelve POPs were listed to be eliminated or their production and use restricted.

It consists of the ancient townships of Bradford, Manchester, and Beswick, Manchester, both in the ancient parish of Manchester and hundred of Salford. Bradford-with-Beswick The name Bradford-with- Beswick appears to have been coined by Christ Church, the 19th-century church that served the communities of those growing villages to the east of Manchester. Christ Church lay on the corner of Church Street and Cowper Street, on the boundary between the two villages, and it seems reasonable that the church authorities should use this name to describe them. Christ Church, Bradford, was built in 1862 in the Early English style; the benefice was a rectory and its parish included Bradford and parts of Beswick and Openshaw.Bradford, Lancashire; UK Genealogy Archives Bradford village For administrative purposes, Bradford village was originally part of the Salford Hundred in the County Palatine of Lancaster. It is bordered by Miles Platting to the north and the River Medlock and the Ashton Canal both run through it. The village name is ancient and in 1196 it was known as Bradeford, meaning \\"broad ford\\". Until the Industrial Revolution, Bradford Village was rural with woodland, pastures and streams. It is reported that wolves and eagles once inhabited the woodlands and that honey production was part of the local economy. Bradford Village also formed part of the Parish of Manchester but it was still an independent township having its own parochial offices under the Manchester churchwardens. In 1841 all this changed and the township became a member of the Manchester Union of Poor Law Guardians, which was established under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1841. From the 13 April 1850, until its incorporation into the township of North Manchester in 1896, the village was a member of the Prestwich Union, constituted by order of the Poor Law Board in 1850. The Local Board was set up in 1863, under the Public Health Act of 1848. Since the days of the Tudors (1485-1603), sufficient coal was mined at the village to supply most of the needs of Manchester but with the onset of the Industrial Revolution Bradford Colliery, as it was then known, was rapidly expanded to provide fuel to power steam engines in the new cotton mills that were springing up in the district. With the coming of the Ashton Canal in 1797, the colliery was connected to it by means of a private branch. This canal branch also served the other large employer in Bradford Village, Richard Johnson & Nephew (Bradford Ironworks), who manufactured wire of all kinds. In 1871, the owner of Bradford Colliery was R.T. Parker and the occupier, for rate purposes, was T.& C. Livesey. When deeper pit shafts were sunk, seams of fireclay were discovered and consequently a brickworks was built on the north side of the site to manufacture firebricks for use in lining furnaces. The brickworks had the same owner and occupier as Bradford Colliery. By 1896, the pit manager was H.L. Ward and the under-manager was George Bentley. At that time there were 404 underground workers and 125 surface workers. Four types of coal were mined: gas coal, household coal, manufacturing coal and steam coal. The brickworks was still operational in 1896 but by this time it was owned by Edward Williams. However, the only employees were three underground workers still extracting clay and two surface workers and this indicates a decline in the local firebrick manufacturing industry. Bradford Colliery remained open until September 1968 when it closed; not because its supply of coal was exhausted, but because of the subsidence that would have been caused by the exploitation of new coal seams. In 1869, a giant gasholder or gasometer was built at the new Bradford Gas Works and this, along with the adjacent colliery, ironworks and cotton mills, was a dominant feature of the landscape. Beswick village Beswick village is also ancient and around 1200-30 it was known as Bexwic, believed to be a combination of a personal name and a settlement or dwelling place. The River Medlock and the Ashton Canal both run through it. Beswick village was originally smaller than Bradford village and it became part of the township of Manchester in 1838, being joined with Ardwick to form a municipal ward in the new township. For poor law purposes it was added to the Prestwich Poor Law Union, which was constituted by order of the Poor Law Board in 1850. In 1896 it was among the townships consolidated to form the township of North Manchester for Poor Law purposes. At the height of the Industrial Revolution there was less industry here than in Bradford village and consequently back-to-back terraced houses abounded everywhere. Two open spaces were the David Lewis Play Ground and Bradford Recreation Ground. Philips Park and Philips Park Cemetery Philips Park is on the south side of the River Medlock, and Philips Park Cemetery is on the north side. The park has the distinction of being Manchester's original public park and Mark Philips, who was the Member of Parliament for Manchester, opened it in 1846. It was the first of its kind in Britain and it set the standard for many others that soon followed in towns and cities throughout Britain. It was designed to have walks, expansive lakes and glasshouses for exotic plants. It is also famous for its annual Tulip Festival, which is still held every year. Philips Park Cemetery was opened in 1863.

Biography Chappuis' pseudonym derives from the first BD magazine he created at age twelve, named \\"Zep\\" in honour of Led Zeppelin (a fan of Bob Dylan, references to his musical tastes are often found in his comics). His career began with gags published in Spirou magazine in 1987, and the character Victor which started appearing in 1988. At first struggling to find publication, the series Titeuf was initially published in the fanzine Sauve qui peut (\\"Escape those who can\\") before it was noticed by Glénat executive Jean-Claude Camano. Zep joined Glénat in 1992, and first Titeuf book Dieu, le sexe et les bretelles (God, Sex And Suspenders) appeared in 1993 and sold only a few thousand copies, but the following books have gradually won over a huge readership, outselling traditional French favorites such as Astérix and Lucky Luke. Today 11 million copies of the series have been sold, and the series is considered the greatest moneymaker in the French comics market. Titeuf books have been translated into 15 languages, including Chinese, Italian and German. In the UK, Titeuf appeared under the name Tootuff in The Dandy. The name \\"Titeuf\\" ostensibly derives from French tête d'oeuf (egg-head), but it could also be the familiar, contracted and inverted (verlan) form of petite fête (little party). Zep designed the album cover of Jean-Jacques Goldman's record Chanson pour les pieds (2001).

It is owned by the City of Waco. The airport is a 15-20 minute drive from downtown and central Waco. Facilities Waco Regional Airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 1/19 is 7,107 x 150 ft and 14/32 is 5,103 x 150 ft. In 2006 the airport had 36,011 aircraft operations, averaging 98 per day: 65% general aviation, 27% air taxi, 8% military and 1% airline. 100 aircraft are based at the airport: 53% single-engine, 38% multi-engine, 6% jet and 3% helicopter. The airport has 2 jetways with 3 gates in use, with Envoy Air and SkyWest Airlines service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The Aerodrome Cafe is located inside the terminal building. As of January 2019, Waco Regional Airport is host to two full service FBOs: Texas Aero and Waco Jet Center. Flight training at Waco Regional is provided by Master the Tailwheel, which specializes in initial tailwheel training and endorsements. Airlines and destination =Passenger= History Control tower and Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita trainer parking ramp cadets in formation Waco Regional Airport's history begins in 1941 when some grazing farmland was chosen for the new Waco Municipal Airport. Construction began in late summer 1941. Big Spring Army Airfield Advanced Bombardier School 1943 Classbook In early 1942 the War Department leased the site and it was provided to the United States Army Air Forces for a training airfield. At the time, construction consisted of three runways partly completed. The Army Air Force began to rush the project to completion and changed the civil building plans to that of a military airfield and ground station. Barracks, mess halls, a hospital, church, theater, administrative buildings, aircraft hangars and a control tower were built. The facility was initially named China Springs Army Air Field and later Waco Army Air Field No. 2 before being renamed Blackland Army Airfield after the local black soil. Blackland AAF was activated on 2 July 1942, initially being a glider training school. The AAF brought a nucleus of experienced airmen from other airfields in the AAF Gulf Coast Training Center, and then civilian specialists were recruited from around the United States to supplement the military garrison. The civilian workers were instructed in Army aviation procedures and to fill hundreds of jobs necessary to support the pilot training program. In October 1942 the Army Air Force Pilot School (Advanced Twin-Engine) was activated (phase 3 pilot training). On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and activated the 33d Flying Training Wing (Advanced Twin-Engine) at Blackland and assigned it to the AAF Central Flying Training Command. The school used a number of two-engine trainers, including the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, Curtiss-Wright AT-9, Beechcraft AT-10 Wichita, and TB-25 Mitchell. The school's mission was to train cadets to fly twin-engine transports and bombers in a nine-week course. During training flight training was combined with ground school classes including radio navigation, aircraft and naval identification, armament, photo interpretation, weather forecasting and other courses. Several hours of instruction were taught in the ground-based Link Trainers. Pilot wings were awarded upon graduation and were sent on to group combat training by First, Second, Third or Fourth Air Force. Graduates were usually graded as Flight Officers (Warrant Officers); cadets who graduated at the top of their class were graded as Second Lieutenants. Flying training at the airfield ended on 4 February 1945 and it became a sub-base of Waco Army Airfield. The field became inactive on October 31, 1945. By 1950 the facility was disposed of by the War Assets Administration (WAA) and deeded to the local government, being operated as Waco Municipal Airport. Some buildings were used as a public housing project. The first airline flights were on Braniff, which had been flying to the previous Waco airport since the 1930s. Pioneer arrived in 1947; successor Continental and Braniff pulled out in 1963. Trans-Texas DC-3s appeared in 1956 and left in 1959, then returned in 1963; Texas International's last Convair 600 left in 1978.

It centers on Maddie Hayes (Cybill Shepherd), a former model who loses most of her financial assets due to her accountant's embezzlement but unexpectedly finds that she owns a detective agency. She teams up with cocky, chauvinistic investigator David Addison (Bruce Willis) to run the agency and becomes embroiled in various unusual cases. The show's other regular characters are Agnes DiPesto (Allyce Beasley), the agency's receptionist, and Herbert Viola (Curtis Armstrong), one of the agency's investigators, who was introduced in the third season and became a featured character in the fourth season. The show mixes drama, comedy and romance, and often incorporates fantasy sequences or breaks the fourth wall. The series premiered on ABC in the United States with a feature-length pilot episode on March 3, 1985. The series lasted 5 seasons, but only 66 episodes were produced, a low figure for American television, for which a full season normally includes at least 22 episodes. The show became notorious for failing to have a new episode ready to air each week, due to on-set problems including script issues and friction between actors and producers. Most episodes aired on Tuesday nights, although when the show returned in April 1989 after a two-month hiatus, the remaining episodes aired on Sunday nights. During its early years, the series was popular with viewers and broke into the top ten of the Nielsen ratings in its third season. When Maddie and David ended more than two years of sexual tension by sleeping together in that season's highly publicized penultimate episode, \\"I Am Curious… Maddie\\", it drew an audience of 60 million viewers. The show was also a critical hit, receiving 16 Emmy Award nominations in 1986. Ratings declined, however, in the later seasons, and the show was canceled in 1989.

The flavours are creamy with mushroom and nutty aftertastes but vary depending on maturity of cheese. Gubbeen Farmhouse Products also produce a Smoked Gubbeen. Gubbeen Cheese has been produced since 1979 by Tom and Giana Ferguson at the Gubbeen Farm in Schull, County Cork. The name \\"Gubbeen\\" is an anglicisation of the Irish word \\"Gobín\\" which means a small mouthful, and which a local nearby bay is referred to. All milk used for the cheese comes from their own herd of dairy cows, which is a mixture of several breeds; British Friesian, Simmenthal, Jersey, and Kerry. The milk is stored in vats to which starter culture and rennet are added, causing the milk to set. This is then cut and stirred until the curds develop. The cheese is developed in curing rooms where the rind is washed daily. This is an important part of the process as the washing gives rise to the distinctive surface bloom and develops the characteristic flavours. The cheese develops deeper flavours as it matures. In 2001, a new strain of lactic acid producing bacteria, Microbacterium gubbeenense, was named after a study into the smear-ripening of Gubbeen cheese.Microbacterium gubbeenense sp. nov., from the surface of a smear-ripened cheese Each cheese is in diameter, in height, weighs and has a fat content of 48%.

In terms of both area of the basin and the average discharge, the Onega is the third river basin of the White Sea (behind the Northern Dvina and the Mezen. The river basin of the Onega is spread over the west of Arkhangelsk Oblast, north-west of Vologda Oblast, and also includes minor areas in the east of Republic of Karelia. The Onega basin includes some of the biggest lakes of Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts, such as Lake Vozhe, Lake Lacha, Lake Lyokshmozero, Lake Kenozero, Lake Undozero, and Lake Kozhozero, as well as Kenozersky National Park. The whole valley of the Onega is populated, with the exception of the stretch between Severoonezhsk and Yarnema, in Plesetsky District. There are two towns located on the river Onega, Kargopol close to its source and Onega in its mouth. There are also two urban-type settlements, located opposite to each other in the middle course of the river, Oksovsky (right bank) and Severoonezhsk (left bank). of the river's lower course, between the village of Gorodok and the selo of Porog, is listed in the State Water Register of Russia as navigable. The rest of the Onega is notable for the rapids, spread everywhere between Kargopol and Gorodok, and also located downstream from Porog (the name Porog means a rapid). The Onega basin area has an important historical and cultural significance. Kargopol is one of the oldest cities in Russian North (the traditional foundation date in the 12th century, first mentioned in the 14th century), and it still contains a big number of architectural and historical monuments. Oshevensk on the left bank of the Onega is the location of the former Alexandro-Oshevensky Monastery. Another historically important monastery in the Onega basin is the Kozheozersky Monastery on an island in the Lake Kozheozero. Some of the finest monuments of the northern wooden architecture are located in the basin of the Onega, including ensembles of Lyadiny, Saunino Pogost, Krasnaya Lyaga, and Bolzhaya Shalga. These monuments also suffer from the lack of protection and their number steadily diminishes. In fact, the majority of them have been lost. The river splits into the Big Onega and Little Onega from its estuary, but then these branches join again, forming a big flat island. It freezes up in late October - early December and stays under the ice until mid-April - May. It was used for timber rafting. The Onega flows among the coniferous forests (taiga of spruce, pine, and larch), mostly among the swamps. There are only four bridges across the Onega: one in Kargopol on the road connecting Kargopol to Nyandoma, one in the village of Sorokinskaya, on Onezhsky Trakt, the road connecting Kargopol to Plesetsk and Yemetsk, one combined road and railway bridge connecting Oksovsky and Severoonezhsk, and one railway bridge in Porog on the railway from Arkhangelsk to Belomorsk (no road traffic). Elsewhere, including the former district center of Konyovo, the Onega can only be traversed by ferry crossings.

In Jewish synagogues, it is also known as a bimah and is for Torah reading during services. In an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, a bema is the raised area around the aron kodesh, or the sanctuary. In antiquity it was made of stone, but in modern times it is usually a rectangular wooden platform approached by steps.Britannica Concise Encyclopædia: 'bema' Ancient Greece The bema, or speaker's platform, at the Pnyx in Athens The Ancient Greek bēma () means both 'platform' and 'step', being derived from bainein (, 'to go').Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Roderick McKenzie.

Leiden: Brill, 2010, s.v. βαίνω (p. 192). The original use of the bema in Athens was as a tribunal from which orators addressed the citizens as well as the courts of law, for instance, in the Pnyx. In Greek law courts the two parties to a dispute presented their arguments each from separate bemas. By metonymy, bema was also a place of judgement, being the extension of the raised seat of the judge, as described in the New Testament, in and , and further, as the seat of the Roman emperor, in , and of God, in , when speaking in judgment. Judaism Amsterdam Synagogue: the bema (or tebáh) is in the foreground, and the Hekhál (Ark) in the background. The bimah (Hebrew plural: bimot) in synagogues is also known as the almemar or almemor among some Ashkenazimalmemar [ælˈmiːmɑː], Collins English Dictionary (from the Arabic, al-minbar, meaning 'platform'). The post- Biblical Hebrew bima (), 'platform' or 'pulpit', is almost certainly derived from the Ancient Greek word for a raised platform, bema (). (A proposed link to the Biblical Hebrew bama (), 'high place' is far less likely.) Among the Sephardim, it is known as a tevah (literally 'box, case' in Hebrew) or migdal- etz ('tower of wood'). It is typically elevated by two or three steps, as was the bimah in the Temple. At the celebration of the Shavuot holiday when synagogues are decorated with flowers, many synagogues have special arches that they place over the bimah and adorn with floral displays. The importance of the bimah is to show that the reader is the most important at that moment in time, and to make it easier to hear their reader of the Torah. A raised bimah will typically have a railing. This was a religious requirement for safety in bimah more than 10 handbreadths high, or between . A lower bimah (even one step) will typically have a railing as a practical measure to prevent someone from inadvertently stepping off. The bimah became a standard fixture in synagogues from which a portion (parashah) from the Torah and the haftarah are read. In Orthodox Judaism, the bimah is located in the center of the synagogue, separate from the Ark. In other branches of Judaism, the bimah and the Ark are joined together. Christianity Bema in an Eastern Orthodox church, with three steps leading up to it. Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk, western Russia The ceremonial use of a bema carried over from Judaism into early Christian church architecture. It was originally a raised platform with a lectern and seats for the clergy, from which lessons from the Scriptures were read and the sermon was delivered. In Western Christianity the bema developed over time into the chancel (or presbytery) and the pulpit. In Eastern Christianity bema remains the name of the platform which composes the sanctuary; it consists of both the area behind the iconostasion and the platform in front of it from which the deacon leads the ektenias (litanies) together with the ambo from which the priest delivers the sermon and distributes Holy Communion. It may be approached by one or several steps. The bema is composed of the altar (the area behind the iconostasion), the soleas (the pathway in front of the iconostasion), and the ambo (the area in front of the Holy Doors which projects westward into the nave). Orthodox laity do not normally step up onto the bema except to receive Holy Communion.

Early life Wickham was born in Smithtown on Long Island, but was raised in New York. He was the son of Daniel H. and Ruth Wickham, who lived at 71 West 11th Street in New York. He was a distant cousin of John Wickham, the attorney for Aaron Burr during his trial for treason. It was Burr who transformed Tammany into a political machine for the election of 1800. Career Early in his career, he worked for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and was a volunteer fireman. Wickham joined Mutual Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 in 1850 and served as foreman. In 1854, he organized the Baxter Hook and Ladder Company No. 15. He was elected Secretary of the New York Fire Department in 1858, Vice President in 1859, and President from 1860 until 1861. =Political career= In the early 1870s, Wickham became an anti-Ring Democrat opposed to Boss Tweed of Tammany Hall. Wickham served as Chairman of the Apollo Hall Democracy, a political group that worked to bring Boss Tweed to justice. He also served on the Executive Committee of Seventy, a group formed by the public to reestablish honest government. In 1874, Wickham was nominated by the Democrats to be Mayor of New York, with the support of a temporarily reformed Tammany Hall. He easily defeated Oswald Ottendorfer, the Independent Democratic candidate, and Salem H. Wales, the Republican. During his two-year tenure starting in 1875, Wickham appointed William C. Whitney to be the City of New York's legal counsel to combat political fraud. Wickham also conducted fundraising for the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. Wickham declined to be re-nominated in 1876. He served on the Board of Education for several years and was a member of the Committee of One Hundred for New York's Columbian celebration. Personal life He was married to Louise Shepard Floyd (1836–1899), the daughter of Jesse Woodhull Floyd (1787–1849) and Miami (née Shepard) Floyd (1795–1880). Together, they were the parents of a daughter: * Louise Floyd Wickham (1858–1933), who did not marry and who attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. After the death of his sister, he adopted her three grown children, one son and two daughters, as his own, and they all lived together at his home. He died at his home, 338 Lexington Avenue, in New York City on January 13, 1893 from heart disease along with his ailment of Bright's Disease. =Legacy= He also has a street named after him in the north Bronx.

Born in Mardin, Ottoman Empire, a few months before the Armenian Genocide, he emigrated to Canada in 1937 and began a career in photography with the help of his brother Yousuf Karsh, and his uncle George Nakash, both accomplished photographers. Malak Karsh was one of Canada's most renowned photographers. He had many photographic exhibitions including exhibitions at the National Arts Centre, the Museums of Nature and History, the Ottawa Congress Centre, in Holland and other countries. His awards included the Order of Canada, the Keys to the City of Ottawa, the Whitton Award, the Professional Photographers of Canada's award as a Master of the Photographs Arts, the CAPIC Lifetime Achievement Award, Photographer of the Year, and the National Film Board of Canada's Gold Medal. In 1952 Malak's fascination with Canada's Capital and the tulips that graced the city following Queen Juliana's gift of 100,000 tulip bulbs inspired Malak's to conceive of an annual tulip festival in Ottawa and working with the Ottawa Board of Trade it was established in 1952.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1882 to 1894. He played primarily for the Louisville Eclipse/Colonels, becoming one of the sport's most accomplished batters of the 1880s. A three-time batting champion, he finished among the top three hitters in the league in each of his first seven years; only twice in his eleven full seasons did he finish lower than sixth. During the era before 1893, when the pitching distance was lengthened from 50 feet to 60 feet 6 inches, Browning ranked third among all major league players in career batting average, and fifth in slugging average. His .341 lifetime batting average remains one of the highest in major league history, and among the top five by a right-handed batter; his .345 average over eight American Association seasons was the highest mark by any player during that league's 10-year existence. \\"The Louisville Slugger\\" was enormously attentive to the bats he used, and was the first player to have them custom-made, establishing a practice among hitters which continues to the present. Playing in spite of serious medical afflictions which rendered him virtually deaf and subjected him to massive headaches, he resorted to alcohol to subdue the pain, but continued to hit well even as his drinking increased. He was also known as \\"The Gladiator\\", though sources differ as to whether the nickname applied to his struggles with ownership, the press, his drinking problem, or particularly elusive fly balls. Early years Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Browning was the youngest of eight children. His father, a grocer, was killed by a tornado when Browning was thirteen years old. Young Pete remained with his mother, ultimately living in the house where he had grown up until the day he died. He displayed considerable athletic prowess from an early age, and in 1877 began playing for a local semipro team, the Louisville Eclipse, and pitched an exhibition win against a National League team. He continued with the Eclipse into 1882, when the franchise became a member of the newly formed American Association, the first major league to rival the NL. Professional career =Early career in Louisville= Browning quickly distinguished himself as an exceptional slugger. He led the league in both batting (.378) and slugging (.510) in its first season, also finishing in the top five in home runs, runs, hits and total bases. He was consistently among the league's top batters through 1888, winning a second batting crown in 1885 and hitting .402 in 1887. In 1884, he acquired his first custom-made bat from the Hillerich & Bradsby company, collecting three hits in his first game using it and beginning a baseball tradition. Twice in the decade, he hit for the cycle: on August 8, 1886, and again on June 7, 1889. He also led the league in hits, total bases and on-base percentage in 1885. After suffering from mastoiditis from a young age, which caused him to lose his hearing and embarrassed him into avoiding school, resulting in essential illiteracy, he underwent the first of several surgeries to alleviate the condition in 1884, though the problem would afflict him throughout his career. Other aspects of Browning's game were less polished; he has usually been regarded as one of the worst fielders in major league history, although some recent assessments have begun to question that view. American Gladiator, his first biography, recounted numerous \\"web gems\\" by Browning from the beginning of his career to the very end. The revised assessment is that Browning was a superb outfielder when he was sober and not suffering from the effects of mastoiditis, a serious infection of the inner ear usually contracted during childhood. After being used primarily as an infielder in his first three seasons, playing every position except catcher over that span, he was shifted to the outfield on a permanent basis in 1885. While the inferior equipment of the time is somewhat of a mitigating factor, Browning's playing record presented various evidence against any hidden defensive prowess. So did his unusual habit of playing the infield while standing on one leg, which he claimed to have adopted in order to avoid collisions with other players; however, some sources have noted that his probable rationale was to gain an advantage against baserunners he could not hear by aiming one leg toward them, and that he continued to do so in the outfield because he couldn't hear his teammates on either side. An oft- reported story, possibly apocryphal, features one of Browning's managers claiming that the team would be better off with a wooden statue of an Indian in the outfield, since there was at least a slim chance that a batted ball might strike the statue and rebound back in the direction of the field. Indeed, he led league outfielders in errors in both 1886 and 1887. Browning's baserunning was also considered sub-par, exacerbated by his refusal to slide. =Later career= Browning lost his appetite for playing in Louisville during a hellish 1889 season. That year, the luckless franchise (by now known as the Colonels) finished last in the league with 27 wins and 111 losses, 66.5 games behind the top club. The season included not only a major league record 26-game losing streak, but also a narrow escape from the Johnstown Flood and the sport's first-ever strike. In the dispute, Browning was one of six players who refused to take the field as a protest against a series of heavy fines assessed by team owner Mordecai Davidson. The game took place as scheduled with the assistance of three local amateurs, and the striking players returned to work before the next contest. Browning finished the season with a .256 average, the first time he was not among the league's top three hitters. He left the American Association after eight seasons with a .345 career average, which would stand as the best mark by any player with more than one season in the league; Tip O'Neill ranks second at .343. As a result of these events, as well as other labor disputes throughout the sport, Browning — along with nearly all the game's stars — chose to jump to the Players' League for the 1890 season, and played for the Cleveland Infants. The American Association had long been considered inferior to the NL, but in that season Browning proved that he was indeed among the game's top hitters by winning his third batting title with a .373 mark. The league dissolved after its sole season, and Browning spent the remaining four years of his career bouncing around between franchises in the NL. He spent time with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1891) and Cincinnati Reds (1891–92), then was back with the Colonels, who had joined the NL in a league merger (1892–93), before ending his major-league career in 1894 with a handful of appearances for the St. Louis Browns and Brooklyn Bridegrooms in the National League. (He began the 1894 season playing minor- league ball for \\"Kelly's Killers\\" of Allentown, Pa. in the Pennsylvania State League. The team was managed by future Hall-of-Famer Mike \\"King\\" Kelly.) His last professional season was in 1896 with the Columbus Buckeyes in the Western League. In the years before 1893, among players with at least 2500 career at bats, his batting average of .341 ranked behind only Dan Brouthers (.343) and Dave Orr (.342), with his slugging mark of .467 trailing only those of Brouthers (.520), Orr (.502), Roger Connor (.488) and Sam Thompson (.468). His recognized career hit total through 1893 ranked 10th in major league history to that point. Brouthers, a five-time champion, was the only other major league player to win more than two batting titles in the 19th century. Personal life Browning was tormented for his entire life by mastoiditis, which can result in deafness, vertigo, facial palsy, and brain damage. As a result, he lost his hearing at a young age, and was faced with frequent bouts of crippling head pain. The deafness had led Browning to drop out of school at an early age, so that he went through life as a virtual illiterate, and in order to deaden the physical pain resulting from his condition, he began drinking heavily in his youth. The drinking quickly spiraled out of control; he often appeared on the field while drunk, and was suspended for the final two months of the 1889 season for drunkenness, along with other shorter suspensions at different times. He was unable to stop, however, frequently stating, \\"I can't hit the ball until I hit the bottle.\\" Browning was a man of eccentric personal habits, particularly in relation to his bats. He spoke to them, and gave each one a name, often that of a Biblical figure. In the belief that any individual bat contained only a certain number of hits, he would periodically \\"retire\\" bats, keeping vast numbers of the retired ones in the home he shared with his mother. These bats were 37 inches long and 48 ounces in weight, enormous even by the standards of the time. He also habitually stared at the sun, thinking that by doing so, he would strengthen his eyes. He also \\"cleansed\\" his eyes when travelling by train by sticking his head out the window in an effort to catch cinders in them. Browning also computed his average on his cuffs on a regular basis, and was not above announcing to all when his train arrived at a depot that he was the champion batter of the American Association. He remained a lifelong bachelor, though his affection for prostitutes was a matter of much discussion in the newspapers. He was the uncle of film director Tod Browning.Kleber, John. \\"Louis Rodgers 'Pete' Browning\\", in The encyclopedia of Louisville, University Press of Kentucky, 2001, p. 137. After his retirement as a player, Browning worked as a cigar salesman and owned a bar, which ultimately failed; but his physical condition continued to deteriorate due to the mastoiditis and resulting complications. He remained a popular Louisville figure until June 7, 1905, when he was declared insane and committed to a local asylum (Lakeland). A sister released him two weeks later, but a month after that, he was in the hospital, suffering from a general physical collapse. He died in Louisville on September 10 of that year at age 44. The specific cause of death was listed as asthenia (a weakening of the body), a cover-all medical term used by doctors of that time. However, he no doubt suffered from a wide variety of serious physical complaints. In addition to the mastoiditis, he was afflicted with cancer, advanced cirrhosis of the liver, alcohol-related brain damage, and according to some sources, paresis. Some sources erroneously report that he died in an insane asylum; he was in Lakeland Asylum a short time before he died. He is buried in historic Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville. Historical impact Browning was an important figure in baseball's history. In addition to his accomplishments as a player, which have made him a popular candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame, his legacy is expressed in the game in other ways as well. Browning is probably best remembered today as the inspiration behind the Hillerich & Bradsby company's popular \\"Louisville Slugger\\" line of baseball bats. He was the first player to purchase a bat from the company, and they adopted the name a few years later to honor his patronage and capitalize on his fame. Browning's decision to sign with Pittsburgh in 1891 is noteworthy, as this transaction helped cement the team's new nickname of \\"Pirates\\". When the Players' League collapsed, its members were supposed to return to their franchises from the prior season. Pittsburgh, though, signed several players who were theoretically under the control of other clubs, starting with second baseman Lou Bierbauer. Other franchises decried these acts of \\"piracy\\", and the name stuck. The strike by Browning and his Louisville teammates is also important in that it was the first labor action in what was ultimately a long series of disputes between players and management, prefacing the formation and collapse of the Players' League. In 1984, a new grave marker was dedicated for Pete Browning, one that correctly spelled his name and listed all his major baseball achievements. The new marker was the idea of Philip Von Borries, who wrote the copy for the new marker and who also co-designed the marker. The ceremonies, jointly held by the city of Louisville and the Hillerich & Bradsby Company, came during the company's centennial celebration of their famed Louisville Slugger bat (of which Browning is the namesake). There was a Browning's Restaurant & Brewery adjacent to Louisville Slugger Field. The Nineteenth Century Committee of the Society for American Baseball Research named Browning the Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend for 2009 — a 19th- century player, manager, executive or other baseball personality not yet inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

Founded in 1988, Motionhouse operates under the direction of husband and wife team Louise Richards and Kevin Finnan MBE and the company aims to create startling, passionate dance theatre that fuses images, action and dynamism to surprise, challenge and delight their audiences. Imagery, theatricality and immediate impact combine with modern, contemporary dance and a focus on accessibility. Motionhouse also draw on theatre, circus, acrobatics and film to create performance spectacle with meaningful and resonant content which speaks directly to people through imagery and physicality. In 2017 director Kevin Finnan MBE became first Visiting Professor of Dance at Birmingham City University’s Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. He has an MA in Contemporary Performing Arts from University College Bretton Hall and a PhD in Theatre from Warwick University. He is a Research Fellow at the University of Warwick and Associate Artist of Greenwich+Docklands International Festival. In 2013 he was made an honorary Doctor of Letters at the University of Warwick in recognition of the importance of his work and his service to the arts. He was awarded an MBE in 2013 for his services to dance Motionhouse performing their full-length piece; Scattered History Motionhouse was commissioned to produce a spectacular outdoor event which formed part of the opening weekend celebrations of the London 2012 Festival in the West Midlands. The Voyage was created in partnership with Sydney’s aerialists Legs On The Wall. The Voyage featured film from Logela Multimedia, a life-size oceangoing liner and a cast of hundreds. The Voyage was produced by Birmingham Hippodrome and was performed in Victoria Square, Birmingham from 21–24 June 2012. An enormous ship will sail into the centre of Victoria Square, Birmingham, docking itself beside the city’s Town Hall. High above the people who gather to look at this marvel, dancers and aerialists appear in the ship’s rigging – the voyage begins. The Voyage will be one of five large-scale events commissioned for the London 2012 Festival. The Voyage is a story that explores what this means for us all: departures and arrivals, hopes and fears, expectations and disappointments. Professional dancers and aerialists will join forces with a huge amateur choir, live musicians and over 140 community performers to transform the Square and tell the story. In the run up to The Voyage Motionhouse will be running a participatory project called Quest which offers young people from the West Midlands the chance to be part of the London 2012 celebrations. From March 2012 Motionhouse will be creating material with 8 community groups which they will then go on to perform in The Voyage. Motionhouse won the Audience Award in the National Dance Awards 2005, as well as winning the Audience Prize for the MiramirO Festival in 2009 and is currently on the GCSE syllabus for dance in England and Wales. The structure of Perfect is thematic rather than narrative and explores the concept of time. Motionhouse has produced 18 full-length, middle-scale touring productions and a series of dance spectacles in sights and spaces throughout the UK. The 2005 production Perfect won critical acclaim and is currently on the GCSE syllabus for dance in England and Wales. The structure of Perfect is thematic rather than narrative and explores the concept of time.PerfectED Education Pack, Motionhouse, 2009 Motionhouse currently employs eight professional dancers and in 2011 it toured in seven different countries throughout the world. In its first year of touring, Scattered, Motionhouse’s 18th theatre production opened the Sibiu International Theatre Festival in Romania where it was deemed the “revelation of the festival” by the event director. Scattered continues to tour into 2012 and beyond and completed its first international tour in 2011, taking in dates in Macau, Belgium and Portugal as well as a return visit to Romania. Tours of Scattered are planned for the China in autumn 2012 and Motionhouse has also been taken on by IMGA Artists who are currently representing the company in USA, Asia/Pacific and Europe and are building a tour of Scattered planned for the United States in spring 2013. The tour is set to continue into 2012 at various venues in the UK, Europe, China and USA. Motionhouse have 3 festival pieces in rep, Cascade, Underground and Chaser which are widely performed across the UK and Europe. Generally, these pieces require fewer dancers than the theatre touring pieces, are smaller and therefore more flexible and easier to tour and are usually shorter (lasting from fifteen to twenty five minutes). As a result, the company can perform at simultaneous festivals in different locations, performing more than once a day. Motionhouse’s 2008 piece Underground won the Audience Prize at the MiramirO Festival in Ghent, Belgium in 2009. In 2011, Motionhouse had the opportunity to reunite with some JCB diggers and create two new pieces in their Machine Dance collection. Waiting Game premiered on 3 March and is a playful and audacious trio of 2 dancers and a JCB digger which takes place in a familiar restaurant situation. Turning dining out on its head, the 2 dancers are waited on by a JCB - but the quality of the service leaves something to be desired! Traction followed in November, commissioned by Birmingham Bullring and with the number of diggers and dancers tripling the Machine Dance made a climactic celebration to launch a new development to the shopping centre complex. Traction is a stunning Transformers-esque performance that sees 6 dancers and 3 JCB diggers dancing together with extreme acrobatic partnering, animal-like strength and startling unison phrases. Traction is a high voltage celebration of the powerful harmony of humans and machines and is at once impossibly emotive and theatrically unforgettable, defying gravity and suspending disbelief. Motionhouse provides community education programs, as well as outreach and community work in its campaign for wider and more accessible dance education. Funding Motionhouse is a National Portfolio Organisation of Arts Council England and is regularly funded by Warwickshire County Council and Warwick District Council.[10] Following the 2010 Coalition Government's Comprehensive Spending Review Motionhouse have seen their funding cut from around £270k to £250k. On 30 March 2011 further funding decisions were announced by Arts Council England. In this round Motionhouse received a further cut to their funding of around 11% whereas 4 other West Midlands-based dace organisations all received significant uplifts and another Warwickshire based arts organisation, Live and Local, became part of the National Portfolio with a rise in funding of 80%. Productions *Charge (2015) -Inspired by the role of electricity in the human body, Charge, is a multi-media show about energy.

For decades it was recognizable by the white, ladder-like snake on the building's roof. This work of art was called \\"Starsteps\\" and was dismantled when ownership of the building changed hands in 2000. It was one of the Los Angeles landmarks that had previous landmark status in the late 20th century. Landmark status Metromedia Square was one of the L.A. landmarks that had previous landmark status in the late 20th century, until demolition in the first couple of years in the 21st century; 14 years before the demolition of the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, another last Los Angeles landmark demolished to make way for the Banc of California Stadium in 2016. History =Origins= The site was first known as the Nassour Studios, built in 1946 and opened January 1, 1947 by brothers William and Edward Nassour (1911–1962). Over 100 independent films were shot there under the Nassour Studio banner. Originally, there were four sound stages ranging in size from around to just over . Nassour's modern Art Deco-styled projection room and modern offices were located in the buildings fronting Sunset Boulevard. Dressing rooms were constructed adjacent to stages 1 and 2. An old converted two story apartment building located down the street on Van Ness housed producers and writers. The big stage (4) had removable panels that hid a water tank. It was used to film the jungle river scenes in Africa Screams (1949). The lot was very small (about four acres) so an underground facility for storage was necessary. A large freight elevator was installed for access. =A major television facility= In 1950 the Nassour brothers sold their studio to the Times Mirror Company, publisher of the Los Angeles Times.\\"KTTV moves; sets Nassour Studios for film making.\\" Broadcasting - Telecasting, March 13, 1950, pg. 53.\\"KTTV buys Nassour Studios; sale price $2 million.\\" Broadcasting - Telecasting, May 22, 1950, pg. 45. Times-Mirror was looking for a facility to permanently house KTTV (channel 11), its new television station (at the time, owned jointly with CBS) which commenced broadcasting the previous year. The facility was later renamed KTTV Studios. The New York City-based firm Metromedia purchased the property along with KTTV in 1963.\\"KTTV to Metromedia for $10 million plus.\\" Broadcasting, January 14, 1963, pg. 9.\\"FCC okays sale of KTTV(TV) Los Angeles.\\" Broadcasting, June 3, 1963, pg. 75.\\"Metromedia assumes KTTV(TV) operation.\\" Broadcasting, July 8, 1963, pg. 72. In 1967 Metromedia undertook an extensive renovation and expansion of the facility, which included a new office tower and building housing various Metromedia enterprises, including the Harlem Globetrotters, the Ice Capades, the Foster & Kleisler advertising firm and Wolper Productions, the latter of which was purchased by the company in 1964.\\"Metromedia acquires Wolper Productions.\\" Broadcasting, October 26, 1964, pg. 50.\\"Metromedia builds on both coasts.\\" Broadcasting, October 9, 1967, pg. 38.

Television producer Norman Lear moved into the property in 1973 and headquartered his company, Tandem Productions, in the building. Lear started videotaping his television series here in the fall of 1975, including but not limited to: All in the Family; Diff'rent Strokes; The Jeffersons; Maude; Good Times; Hello, Larry; One Day at a Time; and The Facts of Life. One of his other classic shows, Sanford and Son, remained taped at NBC Studios in Burbank; its 1980 revival, Sanford, was videotaped at Metromedia. Shows such as Diff'rent Strokes, The Facts of Life, One Day at a Time, and The Jeffersons later relocated to Universal City Studios by 1982. =Later incarnation= In 1986, Metromedia sold most of its television interests to News Corporation, and KTTV became a cornerstone station of the new Fox Broadcasting Company. As a result, the studios became the Fox Television Center, though Metromedia continued to own the building and the land on which it was situated, leasing the property to Fox and KTTV. The Fox Broadcasting Company launch announcement was made from the property, and on October 9, 1986, the flagship show was broadcast live, The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Shows like the Metromedia and then Fox- produced Small Wonder and NBC's Saved by the Bell as well as the sketch comedy series In Living Color, and the first season of MAD TV were among the last series to be taped at this complex. Ironically, very few Fox television shows were actually taped at the Fox Television Center. The direct-to-syndication seasons (1986-1990) of Mama's Family were also filmed here. KTTV and the Fox network operations moved to their own new building (the present-day Fox Television Center) in West Los Angeles in 1996, which is the corporate home of the Fox Television Stations group. Meanwhile, the radio stations' studios remained there, even long after they were no longer owned by Metromedia. KTWV, now owned by Entercom Media, moved to new studios in Culver City in 1997, and then Miracle Mile neighborhood on L.A.'s Wilshire Boulevard on February 18, 2013. KLAC eventually became acquired by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) and moved to studios shared with Clear Channel's other AM and FM stations, which are now located in Burbank. The Fox Broadcasting Company, which had maintained some business offices at the 20th Century Fox studios in Los Angeles' Century City neighborhood while at the Television Center, moved its complete base of operations to the Century City studio lot shortly after the KTTV move. This new facility, known as the Fox Network Center, is the home to the network's live studio productions, such as Fox NFL Sunday. Metromedia sold the land to the Los Angeles Unified School District in 2000. The building was demolished by the school district in 2003. Replacing the old studios is Helen Bernstein High School, a campus which opened in 2008.

Whitehall is a residential area on the northern outskirts of Dublin's inner city, located near the M1 motorway leading to Dublin Airport, Swords and Belfast, it's situated between the suburbs of Santry and Drumcondra. North of Whitehall, the M1 motorway begins at its junction with the M50, past the Dublin Port Tunnel's northern entrance. The area is adjacent to the major public Beaumont Hospital and to Dublin City University on Collins Avenue. Whitehall takes its name from a house named White Hall, formerly located to the south of the village on Drumcondra Road Upper. The area commonly known as Whitehall Cross, at the intersection of the Swords Road (R132) (north-south) and Collins Avenue (east- west), is in the townland of Clonturk, and was formerly the site of a public house called The Thatch, whose memory is preserved in the name of a nearby road. Education Whitehall College of Further Education is situated on the old site of Whitehall House. Whitehall College was originally named Whitehall House Secretarial School when it was established in 1970 but has since changed its name to Whitehall College of Further Education to reflects its provision of courses. The college has moved to Mobhi Road from its Swords Road building. Other most notable features in the area are Plunket College of Further Education, St. Aidan's Christian Brothers School (whose past pupils include the former Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern and the international footballer Liam Brady), and the Holy Child Girls national school, designed by Robinson and Keefe Architects. The Holy Child boys National School is a similar building designed by the same Architects. Margret Aylward School is a girls secondary school beside Ellenfield park and Whitehall church. Churches The Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Child, parish of Whitehall-Larkhill-Santry (often called Whitehall Church) is a large redbrick church designed by John Robinson of Robinson Keefe and Devane Architects which is a well-known landmark to travellers on the N1. The tower, when viewed from Home Farm, is carefully located to stand on the top of a hill on the axis of the road leaving the city. This church is similar in many respects to Galway Cathedral designed by the same Architect. Before the opening of the Church in Whitehall, the area was served by a temporary church in Larkhill, known as the Tin Church. Sporting National sporting interests are represented by Whitehall Colmcille GAA club from which former All Ireland medal winners Tommy Drumm, Paul Clarke, Paddy Moran and Declan McGrath emanated from. The club is the largest juvenile sporting body in the community here providing Gaelic football, ladies football, Hurling and Camogie to girls and boys from 4 yrs of age up to adult.

The series satirizes European variety shows. Overview The show stars Thomas Lennon as Meredith Laupin, Kerri Kenney as the former Mrs. (Agatha) Laupin, and Michael Ian Black as \\"your cool-ass pal\\" Johnny Blue Jeans. In addition to comedy sketches, the show featured musical guests and various performers, including Ben Stiller. Periodically, a troupe of women called “The Swimsuit Squad” would dance much like the “Fly Girls” on In Living Color. The show's premise was derived from a sketch from The State called \\"The Mr. and Former Mrs. Laupin Variety Program,\\" and the show featured many people who were a part of the comedy troupe. =Sketches= Though Mr. Laupin, the former Mrs. Laupin, and Johnny Blue Jeans were themselves characters, the show did not use recurring characters or feature impersonations. Often, the troupe would address or involve the audience directly; in one theme of this vein, Mr. Laupin and the former Mrs. Laupin would do an old-fashioned plug for their fake sponsor during actual airtime. One in particular had the former Mrs. Laupin asking consumers to ignore or fix errors on their sponsor's products, including a cereal, “Sweety Balls,” in which the second e was replaced with an a. The other common sketch theme was a game show with an odd premise, such as “Plant or Animal,” where an audience member was asked to attribute a few seconds-long recording to either an animal or Robert Plant. This proved more difficult than one might anticipate. Another sketch of this style was “Klingon or Galliano,” where an audience member was shown runway models in various outfits and was asked if they were wearing costumes for Klingons from the science fiction series Star Trek or made by fashion designer John Galliano. This also proved more difficult than one might anticipate. The participant's consolation prize of a tribble coat, presented by an allergic Johnny Blue Jeans, made light of Galliano's controversial use of fur. =Reunion= On January 29, 2011, at the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, California a two-show reunion of Viva Variety was held as part of the 10th annual San Francisco Sketchfest. Lennon, Kenney-Silver and Black reunited for a live, on-stage performance of Viva Variety, with a guest appearance by State alumnus Robert Ben Garant. These sold out shows included video highlights from the original show on the \\"jumbotron\\" and new, improvised material by the cast. Skits included: a game of \\"Thomas vs. George\\", where an audience member had to guess which Jefferson was being described, Johnny Blue Jeans ranked the Police Academy movies in order of cinematic importance, Mr. Laupin pretended to surf while letting inappropriate joke waves pass by, and the former Mrs. Laupin sold Perma-ham as only she can.

Evolution of home TV and stereo Stereo console (stereo radio, record changer and speakers integrated into one cabinet, typical of the late 1960s) A stereo console (or \\"console stereo,\\" as it was sometimes called) is a stereo system containing audio components (such as a stereo record changer and a stereo FM radio) housed into a stand-alone cabinet, as was popular in the 1960s and into the 1970s. A stereo consolette (as identified by one of its manufacturers from that period, Delmonico/Nivico) is a smaller, more compact stereo console that often stands on splayed legs. The corresponding term for console in British English is radiogram. During the 1970s, some stereo manufacturers began designing more lavish and flashy systems to coincide with the psychedelic and disco eras from that decade. Such as was the case when the New York stereo manufacturer Morse-Electro Products produced some of their units with a built- in light organ display. The multicolored lights in the display would flash to the rhythm of the music being played on the system. Stereo consoles would ultimately be replaced by high-fidelity component stereo systems with separate speakers (sometimes called \\"rack systems\\") in the late 1970s, which offered much higher performance without being attached to furniture or being tied to one brand of equipment. Some of these systems had speakers with removable covers, exposing the woofer and tweeter. Production of these systems continued throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s, until smaller, table-top or countertop units (such as the Bose Wave System) began dominating. A console television is a television set housed into a cabinet in the same manner as a stereo console. Production of console televisions lasted much longer than stereo consoles, with units manufactured throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s before being replaced by flat-screen televisions. Home entertainment centers Home entertainment centers may be attached to high-fidelity stereo or quadraphonic speakers. By the 2000s, the best sound systems were designed for home theater and movie sound. It typically includes more than just the left and right stereo channels. Television and VHS typically encodes extra channels onto the two main channels, while digital modes encode this information into the digital DVD source data, with center, two rear, and a subwoofer speakers. The difficulty is usually in wiring and placing the rear speakers and the necessity of buying a receiver that can decode the sound. As the size of video monitors has increased, rather than having a 20-inch TV surrounded by massive stereo equipment, it is common to have a very large flat or projection screen with a small and integrated DVD player / receiver and satellite or digital cable receiver underneath, with small remote speakers and a moderate sized subwoofer. The audio and video components have special connectors which are often hooked to a dedicated box. The items are then plugged into an electrical outlet strip, which should have a surge protector. Each component typically has its own remote control, though expensive universal remote controls are available that can learn or are programmed with most common equipment. The term \\"home entertainment center\\" may also refer to the complete package – the electronic components and the unit in which they are housed. The unit is often either an armoire or a self-contained unit (usually of wood and glass); they often contain dedicated areas (either drawers or other spaces) for storage of records, videotapes, CDs and/or DVDs. In many homes, an entertainment center is often placed in the living room, family room, recreation room, or bedroom. Perhaps the first example of a built-in entertainment center was created by Frank Lloyd Wright at his 1917 Hollyhock House in Los Angeles, California. Custom cabinetry and speakers may be built into or added to an existing house at some expense over free-standing furniture, and video and / or audio signals wired or wirelessly sent to other rooms in the home by dedicated cables, or over a local area network. The term \\"home entertainment center\\" was widely used in the 1980s. It is being replaced by home theater system for large rooms. While high fidelity previously required large turntables, tape decks and speakers, the changing technology of music formats have made small bookshelf systems, Bose desktop radios and iPod based speaker systems which can also produce music of high quality and serve as music entertainment systems by making large component systems again a niche high-end market.

The fleet was meant to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom, and was to be completed by 1948. Development of the plan began in 1938, but it reflected the evolution of the strategic thinking of the Oberkommando der Marine (Naval High Command) over the two decades following World War I. The plan called for a fleet centered on ten battleships and four aircraft carriers which were intended to battle the Royal Navy. This force would be supplemented with numerous long-range cruisers that would attack British shipping. A relatively small force of U-boats was also stipulated. When World War II broke out in September 1939, almost no work had been done on the new ships ordered under Plan Z. The need to shift manufacturing capacity to more pressing requirements forced the Kriegsmarine to abandon the construction program, and only a handful of major ships--all of which had been ordered before Plan Z--were completed during the war. Nevertheless, the plan still had a significant effect on the course of World War II, in that only a few dozen U-boats had been completed by the outbreak of war. Admiral Karl Dönitz's U-boat fleet only reached the 300 U-boats he deemed necessary to win a commerce war against Britain in 1943, by which time his forces had been decisively defeated. Naval construction under the Versailles Treaty , the first major warship built after World War I Following the end of World War I, the German armed forces became subject to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. For the new Reichsmarine, this meant it was limited to six pre-dreadnought battleships, six old light cruisers, 12 destroyers and 12 torpedo boats. A further two pre-dreadnoughts, two cruisers, and four destroyers and torpedo boats apiece could be kept in reserve. The first major ship to be built after the war was the light cruiser in the early 1920s. This was followed by a further three light cruisers of the : , and , and a further two ships that were modified versions of the Königsberg class, and . At the same time, the Germans created a dummy corporation, NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS), in the Netherlands to secretly continue development of submarines. This was in violation of Article 191 of the Treaty of Versailles, which prohibited Germany from possessing or building submarines for any purpose.Treaty of Versailles, Part V, Section II, Article 191 IvS built several submarines for foreign navies, including the Turkish , which was the basis for the Type I U-boat, and the Finnish , which was the prototype for the Type II U-boat. The Treaty also stipulated that Germany could replace its pre-dreadnought battleships after they reached twenty years of age, but new vessels could displace no more than . In response to these limitations, the Germans attempted to build a powerful heavy cruiser--classified as a panzerschiff (armored ship)--that outclassed the new heavy cruisers built by Britain and France. While British and French heavy cruiser designs were bound by the Washington Naval Treaty (and subsequent London Naval Treaty) to a caliber of on a displacement of 10,000 tons, the Germans chose to arm with six guns. The Germans hoped that by building a ship significantly more powerful than the Allies, they could force the Allies to admit Germany to the Washington treaty system in exchange for cancelling Deutschland, thereby abrogating the naval limitations imposed by Versailles. The French vehemently opposed any concessions to Germany, and therefore, Deutschland and two further units-- and --were built. In 1932, the Reichsmarine secured the passage of the Schiffbauersatzplan (\\"Replacement ship construction program\\") through the Reichstag. The program called for two separate production phases, the first from 1930 to 1936, and the second from 1936 to 1943. The latter phase was secretly intended to break the Versailles restrictions. The following year, Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany. He unilaterally withdrew from the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and began the systematic re- building of the armed forces. The prestige brought by the Panzerschiffe led to two improved vessels, the D class, to be ordered. These ships were cancelled and reordered as the battleships and , which were ships armed with nine 28 cm guns and much greater armor protection than their predecessors. In 1935, Hitler signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which permitted Germany to build up to 35 percent of the strength of the Royal Navy in all warship categories. The initial designs for two follow-on ships--the --initially called for a displacement of with guns, but to counter the two new, French s, the new ships were significantly enlarged, to a displacement of over and guns. Operational philosophies Erich Raeder, commander of the Kriegsmarine The postwar German navy was conflicted over what direction future construction should take. In September 1920, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) William Michaelis issued a memorandum laying out the goals of the new Reichsmarine; these goals emphasized coastal defense rather than significant expansion. The German Army viewed Poland as the primary future enemy, and the Navy assumed that in a conflict with Poland, France would support Poland. Thus, the French Navy would be the most likely opponent for the Reichsmarine; Britain was expected to remain neutral in such a conflict. The construction of warships through the mid-1930s was primarily directed against the perceived French threat. Any hypothetical U-boats would generally support the main fleet rather than embark on a commerce-raiding campaign, and any raiding would be done strictly according to cruiser rules. This view remained the established orthodoxy until the mid-1930s, when then-Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Karl Dönitz came to command the U-boat arm. Dönitz advocated a return to unrestricted submarine warfare and the adoption of wolfpack tactics to overwhelm convoy defenses. In the 1920s, the question arose over what to do with the cruisers that would presumably be abroad on training cruises when a war would break out. The high command decided that they should operate as independent commerce raiders. When Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Erich Raeder became the head of the Reichsmarine in 1928, he fully endorsed the concept of long-range surface raiders. This was in large part due to his service in World War I as the chief of staff to Vizeadmiral Franz von Hipper, where he saw the fleet rendered impotent by the crushing British naval superiority. By 1938, Hitler's aggressive foreign policy made conflict with Britain increasingly likely. He ordered that completion of and be expedited, along with six new H-class battleships yet to be laid down. These eight battleships would form the core of a new battle fleet capable of engaging the British Royal Navy. Hitler nevertheless assured Raeder that war would not come until 1948. Raeder meanwhile believed that Britain could be more easily defeated through the surface raider strategy he favored. The initial version of his plan was based on the assumption that the fleet should be centered on panzerschiffe, long-range cruisers, and U-boats to attack British commerce. These forces would tie down British naval power and allow a smaller number of battleships to operate in the North Sea. This first draft was called Plan X; a pared-down revision was renamed Plan Y, and the final version presented to Hitler was Plan Z. Hitler rejected Raeder's proposed construction plan, which led to a more balanced fleet that incorporated the battleships Hitler sought and was accepted on 1 March 1939. Raeder planned to use the battleships and aircraft carriers in task forces to support the panzerschiffe and light cruisers attacking British merchant traffic. The plan Graf Zeppelin at her launching The plan approved by Hitler called for a surface fleet composed of the following vessels, which included all new ships built in the 1920s and 1930s: { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Type ! scope=\\"col\\"  Projected ! scope=\\"col\\"  Completed - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Battleships  10  4 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Battlecruisers  3  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Aircraft carriers  4  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Panzerschiffe  15  3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Heavy cruisers  5  3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Light cruisers  13  6 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Scout cruisers  22  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Destroyers  68  30 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Torpedo boats  90  36 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Total ! scope=\\"row\\"  230 ! scope=\\"row\\"  82 } These figures included the four Scharnhorst- and Bismarck-class battleships already built or building, the three Deutschland- class panzerschiffe and the six light cruisers already in service. To complete the core of the Plan Z fleet, six H-class battleships, three O-class battlecruisers, twelve P-class panzerschiffe, and two s with two more of a new design, were to be built. The five ships of the fulfilled the mandate for heavy cruisers, while the M class of light cruisers would fulfill the requirement for light cruisers. The Spähkreuzer 1938 design would form the basis for the fleet scouts ordered in the program. On 27 July 1939, Raeder revised the plan to cancel all twelve of the P-class panzerschiffe. In the short time from the introduction of Plan Z to the beginning of war with the United Kingdom on 3 September only two of the plan's large ships, a pair of H class battleships, were laid down; material for the other four ships had started to be assembled in preparation to begin construction but no work had been done. At the time components of the three battlecruisers were in production, but their keels had not yet been laid down. Two of the M-class cruisers had been laid down, but they were also cancelled in late September. Work on was cancelled definitively in 1943 when Hitler finally abandoned the surface fleet after the Battle of the Barents Sea debacle. Impact on World War II U-36, a Type VII U-boat Since the plan was cancelled less than a year after it was approved, the positive effects on German naval construction were minimal. All of the ships authorized by the plan were cancelled after the outbreak of war, with only a few major surface vessels that predated the plan completed during the conflict. These included Bismarck and Tirpitz, along with the heavy cruisers Blücher and Prinz Eugen. Without the six H-class battleships or the four aircraft carriers, the Kriegsmarine was once again unable to meet the Royal Navy on equal terms. Most of the heavy ships of the Kriegsmarine were used as commerce raiders in the early years of the war. Two of the panzerschiffe, Deutschland and Graf Spee, were already at sea at the outbreak of war; the former found little success and the latter was ultimately trapped and forced to scuttle after the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939. From October 1940 to March 1941, Admiral Scheer went on her own raiding operation and captured or sank seventeen ships, which made her the most successful of the German capital ship surface raiders in the entire war. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau conducted Operation Berlin, a major sortie into the Atlantic in early 1941. Bismarck and Prinz Eugen went on the last Atlantic raiding mission, Operation Rheinübung, in May 1941. Bismarck sank the British battlecruiser but was herself sunk three days later. The loss of Bismarck led Hitler to prohibit further sorties into the Atlantic; the remaining capital ships were concentrated in Norway for use as a fleet in being and to threaten convoys to the Soviet Union on the Murmansk Run. Despite the fact that Plan Z produced no new warships in time for World War II, the plan represented the strategic thinking of the Oberkommando der Marine (OKM--\\"Naval High Command\\") at the time. Most significantly, the OKM favored surface combatants over the U-boats Dönitz needed for his submarine campaign in the North Atlantic, which left him with only a handful of submarines at the start of war. The two Scharnhorst-class battleships cost close to 150 million Reichsmarks apiece, and the two Bismarck-class ships cost nearly 250 million Reichsmarks each; for this amount of money, the Germans could have built more than a hundred additional Type VII U-boats. The shift to the submarine war was not definitively made until 1943, by which time the campaign had already been lost.

Bush while in France. The history of the unit can be traced to the early days of the Marine Corps. In the 18th and 19th centuries, military musicians (\\"field musics\\") provided a means of passing commands to Marines in battle. The sound of various drum beats and bugle calls that could be heard over the noise of the battlefield signaled Marines to attack the enemy or retreat. Through the 1930s, Marine Corps posts still authorized a number of buglers and drummers to play the traditional calls and to ring a ship's bell to signal the time. Until the 1960s, Marine Corps units sported unit drum and bugle corps within their respective rosters. \\"The Commandant's Own\\" The United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps, the only such formation within the Armed Forces today, was formed in 1934 at historic Marine Barracks Washington, to augment the United States Marine Band \\"The President's Own\\".

For this additional role, they were awarded the scarlet and gold breast cord by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which remains on the uniform. When the war ended, the United States Drum and Bugle Corps resumed performing at various military and public ceremonies. In the early 1950s, the unit gained considerable acclaim performing for an increasing number of civilian audiences. Originally their instrumentation was similar to the other drum and bugle corps of the era. It has evolved along with the civilian corps, although usually adapting trends after they have become established by civilian corps. Music composed specifically for their unique selection of instruments helped establish their reputation for excellence during this period. These factors also led to the unit's formal designation as \\"The Commandant's Own\\", a title noting their special status as musicians for the Commandant of the Marine Corps. In 1968, Truman Crawford, formerly of the United States Air Force Drum and Bugle Corps became musical arranger and instructor for The Commandant's Own. During his 30-year career he had a large impact on the D&B; comparable to that of John Philip Sousa on the United States Marine Band. The new rehearsal facility of \\"The Commandant's Own\\" at Marine Barracks Washington, is named Truman Crawford Hall in his honor.A History of Drum & Bugle Corps, Vol. 2; Steve Vickers, ed.; Drum Corps World, pub.; 2003 Training Like the United States Marine Band, prior to enlisting each potential member of the Drum and Bugle Corps, all must pass a competitive audition.

The United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps does not march in parades of state, but instead is held back in reserve by the Commandant of the Marine Corps who may order it anywhere since the corps serves under the Commandant's immediate command. Uniforms and instruments The field musicians of the United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps wear red and white uniforms with white gauntlets which cover the wrists and bear and play silver color brass instruments.

History Audio Two's trademark song \\"Top Billin'\\" launched the duo to popularity. The duo's debut single, \\"Make it Funky\\", was released in 1987, but it was the b-side, \\"Top Billin'\\", that became the chart hit. The beat — made by Milk Dee and produced by Daddy-O of StetsasonicInterview with Milk Dee at AllHipHop.com — and Milk Dee's lyrics would be sampled and referenced time and time again, even by the group itself: both the group's full-length debut, 1988's What More Can I Say? and its 1990 follow-up, I Don't Care: The Album, were titled after lines from the song. However, the duo would never recapture its initial success. The singles of its second album, \\"I Get the Papers\\" and \\"On the Road Again,\\" were only moderate hits. It was a time of rapid change in the hip hop market; gangsta rap was rising in popularity, and Audio Two found itself unsuccessfully struggling to maintain recording contracts and a fanbase. Audio Two did, however, pave the way for the duo's labelmate MC Lyte, who launched her career with the hit single \\"I Cram to Understand U (Sam),\\" which went to #1 on the Billboard Hip-Hop chart in 1989. Lyte's 1998 album Seven & Seven featured a remake of \\"Top Billin'\\" — with the original instrumental — this time a duet between her and Milk. It has been a widely circulated rumor that both members of Audio Two were brothers of MC Lyte, however this is untrue. In 1994, Milk released a solo EP titled Never Dated on Rick Rubin's American Recordings. While the EP was notable for its single \\"Spam,\\" a duet with the Beastie Boys' Adrock with drum programming by Mike D, aside from the devoted Beastie Boys fanbase the album generated little interest. Milk eventually rediscovered success by producing the singer Eamon, who recorded the 2004 hit \\"Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back).\\" In 2007, Milk Dee recorded a verse for a remix of \\"I Get Money\\" by 50 Cent, thanking all the music artists that sampled \\"Top Billin',\\" which earned him royalties. In recent years, Audio Two member Gizmo became a recording engineer under the name \\"You Can Ask\\" Giz. His audio work has appeared on albums by Donell Jones, Calvin Richardson, Jaheim and Tyrese, among others.

The King's Royal Regiment of New York was formed by exiled Loyalist leader, Sir John Johnson, from American refugees, fleeing rebel persecution,King's Royal Regiment of New York - Carleton to Barrington, 8th June 1776. The On-Line Institute for advances Loyalist Studies Retrieved July 4, 2015. the regiment served with distinction throughout the war, launching raids and relief missions into the Mohawk Valley of New York. The regiment was instrumental in the siege of Fort Stanwix, during the expedition of Colonel Barry St. Leger, down the Mohawk River Valley, in the summer of 1777, and saw action, that same year, in the Saratoga Campaign, at the Battle of Oriskany, Carleton' s Raid, in 1778, and the devastating raid on the Schoharie Valley, in 1780. Along with American Indian allies and fellow provincial regiments, such as Butler's Rangers, the regiment fought a series of low-level raiding campaigns, through the Mohawk Valley. This region was a major agricultural area of New York, and these raids were intended to interdict the supply of foodstuffs to General George Washington's army while pressuring the Revolution's political leaders in the region, who were actively persecuting Loyalist residents as traitors aiding and supplying British troops. The regiment eventually comprised two battalions. Following the war, the first battalion was disbanded in 1783 and the second battalion in 1784. Members of the regiment relocated to the British province of Quebec. They were granted land along the St. Lawrence River valley and Bay of Quinte, today within the province of Ontario in Canada.  Raising the regiment: 1776  On 19 May 1776, Sir John Johnson left his home at Johnson Hall in the Mohawk Valley and travelled with his family and approximately 200 retainers through the Adirondack Mountains to Montreal, Quebec. They arrived on 15 June, just days after Governor Sir Guy Carleton's army recaptured the city. Johnson soon left Montreal to chase the retreating Continental Army southwards down the Richelieu Valley towards Lake Champlain. He met Carleton at Fort Chambly, where the Governor authorized Johnson to raise the King's Royal Regiment of New York. Initially, the members of the regiment comprised Johnson's refugee retainers from his estates in the Mohawk Valley, but the steady stream of Loyalist refugees fleeing to Montreal provided a ready source of recruits for the King's Royal Yorkers.  St. Leger Expedition: 1777  Part of the British Army's strategy to defeat the Continental forces under General Washington involved invading New York from Canada along the traditional Lake Champlain and Lake George water route. A main army from Canada, under the command of Sir John Burgoyne, advanced southwards along this route towards Albany. A second army, under the command of Colonel Barry St. Leger, advanced from Carleton Island in the Saint Lawrence River to Oswego with the intention of descending the Mohawk River valley. St. Leger's army included a small force of regular British soldiers, a large American Indian contingent comprising Six Nations and Canadian Indian warriors, a contingent of Hessian soldiers, volunteers under Joseph Brant's command, and the King's Royal Yorkers under Johnson's command. St. Leger's army besieged Fort Stanwix (located in modern Rome, New York), which was defended by a sizable contingent of Continental Army troops. During the siege, a relief column of 800 men under the command of General Nicholas Herkimer and comprising New York militia advanced towards Fort Stanwix. On 6 August 1777, this relief force was ambushed by American Indian and King's Royal Yorkers at the Battle of Oriskany. During the battle, the relief column was decimated and suffered over 400 casualties, including Herkimer himself, who eventually died of wounds. Routed, the surviving American militia retreated from Oriskany. During the Oriskany engagement, the garrison of Fort Stanwix attacked the encampment of the Crown forces. Johnson and his family were nearly captured, and large quantities of material were seized. Having suffered heavy casualties during the battle, St. Leger's American Indian allies were demoralized by the loss of their camp. The Crown and Indian forces retreated back towards Lake Ontario when reports of another relief force under the command of Benedict Arnold was received.  Campaigns Into the New York valleys: 1778–1782  For the remainder of the Revolution, the King's Royal Yorkers formed an integral part of Canada's garrison. However, each year the regiment sent parties on raids into the Mohawk and neighbouring valleys for the purposes of rescuing beleaguered Loyalists and interfering with the ability of the Continental Army forces to use the region's crops as a source of food for Washington's army. These raids were generally launched from the Lake Champlain corridor or from Oswego, and caused a great deal of disruption. The militia of Northern New York never recovered from the disaster at Oriskany, and the region stood relatively defenseless. In 1780, a large raid in to the Schoharie Valley led by Sir John Johnson gave rise to the destruction of large numbers of farms and pitched battles between the raiders and the demoralized American militia. (Battle of Klock's Field)  Postwar  New York City remained in British hands until the end of the war, behind the protection of its large garrison and the Royal Navy. However, the inability of British commanders to defeat the Revolution led the war to drag on for eight years, resulting in the Continental Army's capture of two major British armies (Battle of Saratoga, Battle of Yorktown) and eroding the British political will to attempt a military solution. As a result, the government of Lord North collapsed and the new British government was formed from parliamentary advocates of a negotiated peace. The Treaty of Paris of 1783 ended the war but left little opportunity for Loyalists to return to their former homes. Municipal and state government in the new United States were held by supporters of Congress. Few of the former rebels were prepared to forget, no less forgive, the punishing raids by the Loyalist regiments in Canada. Still other Congressional sympathizers had enjoyed profit by selling land, homes and farms seized from Loyalists. Under the Treaty, the Loyalists were to be compensated for their losses by the State governments under the arbitration of the United States government. This compensation was never paid. Instead, the British government offered land grants in Canada to the refugees who had fled their homes during the War and those who left afterwards. In 1783, the 1st Battalion of the King's Royal Yorkers was disbanded and settled along the St. Lawrence Valley in the vicinity of Cornwall in modern Stormont and Dundas counties. The following year, the 2nd Battalion was disbanded and settled in modern Frontenac and Lennox and Addington counties. Sir John Johnson settled in Montreal and also held farms in Williamstown, Ontario and the seigneuries of Monnoir and Argenteuil in Quebec. He was buried in a family vault at Mont Saint-Gregoire, Quebec. Other officers of the regiment have known graves. Jeremiah French, a lieutenant in the second battalion, was buried at the Maple Grove Cemetery, west of Cornwall, Ontario. In 2004, a new gravestone was dedicated for French in the presence of several of his descendants and members of the recreated King's Royal Yorkers.  Legacy  In 1975, a living history regiment reenacting the King's Royal Yorkers was raised in Ontario. The reenactment King's Royal Yorkers are the largest and most active living history unit in Canada.

Written by Philip Yordan and Frank Burt, the film is about a stranger who defies a local cattle baron and his sadistic son by working for one of his oldest rivals. The film was adapted from a serial of the same title by Thomas T. Flynn, first published in The Saturday Evening Post in 1954, and thereafter as a novel in 1955. The Man from Laramie was one of the first Westerns to be filmed in CinemaScope to capture the vastness of the scenery. The film was also shot in Technicolor. This is the fifth and final Western collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart, the other four being Winchester '73, Bend of the River, The Naked Spure and The Far Country. Mann and Stewart also collaborated on three other films: Thunder Bay, The Glenn Miller Story and Strategic Air Command. The movie's theme song of the same name, written by Lester Lee and Ned Washington, was recorded in the United States by Al Martino and in the United Kingdom by Jimmy Young. Young's version topped the UK Singles Chart for four weeks in October 1955, while Martino's version (which did not chart in the U.S.) stalled at Number 19 that September. Plot Will Lockhart delivers supplies from Laramie to Coronado, an isolated western town. He immediately ends up tangling with the Waggomans, influential owners of the massive Barb Ranch. Lockhart is quietly searching for information about someone who sold repeating rifles to the Apaches; his brother, a green Army lieutenant, was one of many soldiers killed in an Apache attack on a far reach of the Barb Ranch. Patriarch Alec Waggoman is haunted by dreams of a stranger who intends to kill his adult son, Dave. He is also gradually losing his eyesight and cannot count on the immature and vicious Dave. Lockhart is told by Barbara Waggoman, Alec's niece, that he can collect salt for free and haul it away for freight but Dave Waggoman accuses him of stealing, shoots six of Lockhart's mules and burns his three wagons. Lockhart returns to town, engaging first Dave and then ranch foreman Vic Hansbro in a fistfight. Alec shows up and offers Lockhart restitution for his lost property. Sheriff Tom Quigby suggests that Lockhart then leave town to avoid trouble. Lockhart continues searching for the gun runner. Local drunk Chris Boldt tells him that he may know something, but is killed soon after being seen with Lockhart, leading Sheriff Quigby to briefly arrest Lockhart. Vic considers himself a second son to Alec and is engaged to marry Barbara. Alec depends on and respects Vic, but holds him responsible for the damage Dave caused to Lockhart's property and threatens to take it out of Vic's pay. Dave starts a gunfight and is shot in the hand by Lockhart. Lockhart is overpowered, and Dave shoots him through the hand with Lockhart's own gun. Afterwards, Vic rides after Dave and catches him trying to contact the Apaches to deliver 200 repeating rifles for which the Apaches have paid Vic and Dave in advance. Vic is forced to shoot and kill Dave in self-defense, and then lets Alec believe that Lockhart was responsible. Lockhart takes refuge with a rival rancher, Kate Canady, who wishes she and Waggoman, her long-ago fiancé before he married Dave's future mother, could declare a truce. Alec goes over some old bills and finds a bill for wire fence that is very overpriced. He suspects that it conceals a rifle purchase and sets out to discover for himself if Dave was both stealing from him and selling rifles to the Apaches. Vic is unable to talk him out of it, so just before they reach the wagon, the two scuffle and Alec is accidentally pushed off his horse and down a hill. Assuming the old man is dead, Vic rides away. Lockhart finds Alec alive and takes him to Kate to tend to his wounds. When he regains consciousness, Alec is able to tell Lockhart about Dave and Vic and the rifles. Lockhart finds Vic using a smoke signal to call for the Apaches to come for their rifles. Lockhart forces Vic to help him push the wagon off the hilltop and destroy the rifles, then finds he is unable to gun Vic down in cold blood. Vic rides away, but is intercepted and killed by the Apaches. Alec and Kate plan to get married. Barbara intends to leave Coronado and head back east. As Lockhart leaves town, he tells Barbara she will be passing through Laramie on the way and to ask anyone where to find Captain Lockhart, confirming that he is an officer in the U.S. Cavalry.

Mann quit the movie, feeling that Stewart was only making the film so he could play his accordion, something that enraged Stewart so much that the two didn't speak again.

They were the final ECW World Tag Team Champions, holding the titles until the promotion closed in 2001. History =Extreme Championship Wrestling= In December 1997, Doring and Roadkill formed together in an unlikely tag team. For six months, from April to October 1999, they were managed by Angelica (originally called \\"Miss Congeniality\\"), who was the onscreen girlfriend of Doring. At Heat Wave 1999, Doring proposed to her. Angelica, however, left ECW in late October 1999 to join the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), where she became more famously known as Lita. Her last appearance was on October 23, 1999. After the departure of Miss Congeniality, the team was managed by Elektra until she turned on them at Living Dangerously in 2000, costing them a match against CW Anderson and Billy Wiles. In storyline, her reasoning for betraying her team was to join the Dangerous Alliance. Doring and Roadkill quickly embarked on a two-year-long feud with Nova and Chris Chetti. This was followed by a series of feuds with The Impact Players (Lance Storm and Justin Credible), Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger, The Bad Street Boys (Joey Matthews and Christian York) and then Tommy Dreamer and Raven. The team won the ECW World Tag Team Championship on December 3, 2000 at the Massacre on 34th Street pay-per-view, defeating Tony Mamaluke and Little Guido. They held the title until ECW declared bankruptcy in March 2001. =Other promotions= After leaving ECW, Doring and Roadkill made appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and wrestled dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment.

The embracing nude couple depicted in the sculpture appeared originally as part of a group of reliefs decorating Rodin's monumental bronze portal The Gates of Hell, commissioned for a planned museum of art in Paris. The couple were later removed from the Gates and replaced with another pair of lovers located on the smaller right-hand column. Background The Gates of Hell, sculpture by Rodin, where the concept for the sculpture originated. The sculpture, The Kiss, was originally titled Francesca da Rimini, as it depicts the 13th-century Italian noblewoman immortalised in Dante's Inferno (Circle 2, Canto 5) who falls in love with her husband Giovanni Malatesta's younger brother Paolo. Having fallen in love while reading the story of Lancelot and Guinevere, the couple are discovered and killed by Francesca's husband. In the sculpture, the book can be seen in Paolo's hand. The lovers' lips do not actually touch in the sculpture, suggesting that they were interrupted and met their demise without their lips ever having touched. When critics first saw the sculpture in 1887, they suggested the less specific title Le Baiser (The Kiss). Rodin indicated that his approach to sculpting women was of homage to them and their bodies, not just submitting to men but as full partners in ardor. The consequent eroticism in the sculpture made it controversial. A bronze version of The Kiss ( high) was sent for display at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The sculpture was considered unsuitable for general display and relegated to an inner chamber with admission only by personal application. Small versions Rodin's method of making large sculptures was to employ assistant sculptors to copy a smaller model made from a material which was easier to work than marble. Once they had finished, Rodin himself would put the finishing touches to the larger version. Before creating the marble version of The Kiss, Rodin produced several smaller sculptures in plaster, terracotta and bronze. Large marble carvings =French commission= In 1888, the French government ordered the first large-scale marble version of The Kiss from Rodin for the 1889 Exposition universelle, but it was publicly displayed for the first time in the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1898. It was so popular that the company Barbedienne offered Rodin a contract to produce a limited number of smaller copies in bronze. In 1900 the statue was moved to the Musée du Luxembourg before being taken to its current location, the Musée Rodin, in 1918. =Warren's commission= In 1900, Rodin made a copy for Edward Perry Warren, an eccentric American collector who lived in Lewes in Sussex, England, with his collection of Greek antiquities and his lover John Marshall. After seeing The Kiss in the Salon de Paris, the painter William Rothenstein recommended it to Warren as a possible purchase, but The Kiss had been commissioned by the French government and was not available for sale. In its place, Rodin offered to make a copy and Warren offered half of its original price (10,000 francs, instead of 20,000), but Rodin would not lower the price. The contract for the commission included that \\"the genitals of the man must be complete.\\" A previous letter explained that \\"being a pagan and lover of antiquities\\", Warren hoped that the genitals of the man would be sculpted prominently in the Classical Greek tradition rather than modestly hidden. When the sculpture arrived in Lewes in 1904, Warren placed it in the stables at the back of his home, Lewes House, on School Hill, where it remained for a decade. It is not known whether this location was chosen due to the great size of the sculpture or because it did not fulfil Warren's expectations. In 1914 the sculpture was loaned to the Lewes town council and put on public display in the Town Hall. A number of puritanical local residents, led by headmistress Miss Fowler-Tutt, objected to the erotic nature of the sculpture. They were particularly concerned that it might encourage the ardour of the large number of soldiers who were billeted in the town at that time, and successfully campaigned to have the sculpture draped and screened from public view. It was returned to Warren's residence at Lewes House in 1917 where it remained stored in the stable for 12 years until Warren's death in 1928. The beneficiary of Warren's will, H. Asa Thomas, put the sculpture up for sale with Gorringes, the local auctioneers, but it failed to meet its reserve price and was withdrawn from sale. A few years later it was loaned to the Tate Gallery in London. In 1955 the Tate bought the sculpture for the nation at a cost of £7,500. In 1999 between 5 June and 30 October, The Kiss returned briefly to Lewes as part of an exhibition of Rodin's works. Its regular home is now the Tate Modern - however, in September 2007, the work was transferred to the Tate Liverpool, Albert Dock where it assumed pride of place for the duration of the celebrations surrounding both that city's 8th Centenary and Liverpool's European Capital of Culture status in 2008. It was on loan to Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki in Auckland, New Zealand until 16 July 2017. It was loaned to Christchurch Mansion in Ipswich, UK for the 'Kiss and Tell' exhibition running from November 2018 to April 2019. =Jacobsen's commission= The Kiss in marble at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. A third replica was commissioned in 1900 by Carl Jacobsen for his projected museum in Copenhagen, Denmark. The replica was made in 1903, and became part of the initial collection of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, inaugurated in 1906.Inventory Number MIN 609 =Other versions= The three larger marble versions were exhibited together at the Musée d'Orsay in 1995. A fourth copy, about in height – compared to for the copy in Paris – was made after the death of Rodin by sculptor Henri-Léon Gréber for the Rodin Museum of Philadelphia. A plaster cast can be found in the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes of Buenos Aires. A large numbers of bronze casts have been done of The Kiss. The Musée Rodin reports that the Barbedienne foundry alone produced 319. According to French law issued in 1978, only the first twelve can be called original editions. Cornelia Parker Bronze cast in Museo Soumaya, Mexico City In Spring 2003, artist Cornelia Parker intervened in The Kiss (1886) with the permission of the Tate Britain gallery, where it was exhibited at the time, by wrapping the sculpture in a mile of string. This was a historical reference to Marcel Duchamp's use of the same length of string to create a web inside a gallery in 1942.Image of Duchamp's Mile of string at University of Aberdeen Although the intervention had been endorsed by the gallery, many viewers of the sculpture felt it offensive to the original artwork, prompting a further, unauthorised, intervention, in which Parker's string was cut by Stuckist Piers Butler, while couples stood around engaging in live kissing. Popular culture The Kiss is said to have been the influence for the song \\"Turn Of The Century\\", found on the 1977 release of \\"Going For The One\\" by the British band Yes. The Kiss is figured into the plot of the All in the Family episode \\"Archie and The Kiss,\\" where Archie Bunker tries to make his daughter, Gloria, give back a reproduction of the sculpture she had been given by the Bunkers' friend, Irene Lorenzo. Archie expresses his disgust over the morality of the sculpture and sexuality in artwork. The statue is used for a Terry Gilliam animation in Monty Python's Flying Circus. The female extends her left leg straight out, and the male moves his right hand over it, covering holes with the fingers and playing her like an ocarina. The Kiss was part of a side story in Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney's debut novel The Nest, where the sculpture is stolen from the rubble of ground Zero after 9/11.(2016) In the original life- sized work, the male is in an aroused condition. In most American miniatures, this has been censored, and shows the male in a neutral gender.

It is the third largest motorway service area operator, behind Moto and Welcome Break and followed by Extra. History Roadchef was founded in July 1973 by Lindley Catering Investments and Galleon World Travel. In 1986, Patrick Gee, the managing director of the company, set up an employee benefit scheme to give ordinary workers shares in the company. On Gee's early death, Timothy Ingram Hill took over as managing director, having helped lead a management buyout of the company in 1983. Having been one of the original trustees of the employee benefit scheme, he set up a second scheme, to which he was the sole beneficiary, and secretly transferred the bulk of the employees' shares to the second schemehttps://www.pettfranklin.com/news/roadchef-decision.html, leaving ordinary workers with a much reduced scheme.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-31750485 Employee Benefit Compensation Action In May 1998, the company was sold to Japanese investors. It was later revealed that £29 million of shares that should have been distributed to ordinary workers through the employee ownership scheme (REBTL) had been transferred to Tim Ingram Hill, one of the management team. Tim Warwick, who worked as Roadchef's company secretary at the time of the transfer, blew the whistle on the transfer. A prolonged legal battle ensued, the courts declaring the transaction void and ordering Mr Ingram Hill to repay the profit he made from the shares he appropriated. Subsequently, the trustees of the scheme discovered that £10 million had been paid in tax on the appropriated shares by Mr Ingram Hill. This was recovered by the trustees, as the transfer had been declared legally void. However, HMRC continued to insist that a large amount of tax should be paid by the trustees, as the shares were in the possession of Mr Ingram Hill in 2003, when the government passed legislation to make such employee share schemes tax-free.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-54025566?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business&link;_location=live- reporting-story The trustees argued that the shares should not be taxed in any distribution to the ordinary workers, as the scheme clearly would have been included in the tax-free category, had Mr Ingram Hill not appropriated the shares for his own gain. The simple solution of retrospectively adding the Roadchef employee benefit scheme to the list of tax-free schemes was also pointed out by the trustees. It was reported in July 2019 by the Emloyee Benefit Trust's trustee that the ongoing dispute with HMRC is the only remaining obstacle to the distribution of the money to the ordinary workers, and that the current Roadchef management have been fully supportive of the process.http://www.esopcentre.com/wp- content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2019/06/newspad-July-2019-1.pdf An Early Day Motion was tabled in Parliament in September 2019 by Neil Gray MP, who has campaigned extensively on behalf of the staff, criticising HMRC for failing to resolve the dispute.

A large expansion occurred in 1998 when Roadchef agreed to purchase Blue Boar Group and Take A Break for £80 million and thus proceeded to integrate these acquisitions into an enlarged Roadchef Group. At the time, Blue Boar was the fourth largest operator of motorway services areas in the UK with three operational sites and one development site. The acquired Watford Gap site was the first motorway service area to be opened in the UK in 1959 and is one of the UK's best known sites. A few years ago (according to Google Finance), \\"Roadchef Motorways was one of the largest Motorway Services Area (MSA) operators in the UK, with 21 sites representing 24% of the market and serving some 60 million visitors each year.\\" In September 2014, it was announced that owners Delek Group were selling Roadchef to Antin Infrastructure Partners for £153 million.

Originally developed during the 1970s by French educator and philosopher Antoine de La Garanderie, mental management was developed in order for individuals to use their own mental activities and processes more effectively.  History  Developed during the 1970s, mental management theory has expanded on several previous academic dialogues. Having first emerged for educational purposes, the mental management approach has been developed on the research of French educator and philosopher Antoine de La Garanderie who identified distinct mental processes that support learning. His research builds on several previous theories, including the works on introspection by Jean Martin Charcot, Alfred Binet, Maine de Biran and Albert Burloud, who was La Garanderie's professor. Today, its studies are used in four domains systematically; individual functioning; education; therapy; and business.Günes, F. (2013). Zihin Yönetimi/Mental Management. Bartin Üniversitesi Egitim Fakültesi Dergisi, 2(2), 1. There have been developments over the past century that have combined original and newfound scientific techniques and studies to further our understanding of mental processes and hence, improve mental management. This includes the following activities and processes to manage the mind well: attention; retrieval; comprehension; thinking; and imagining. Managing the mind well involves maximising the effectiveness and efficiency of cognitive processes associated through applying deliberate approaches, processes and activities. The computer revolution of the 1950s led in turn to a ‘cognitive revolution’ in psychology during the 1960s and 1970s with the focus upon information processing (via analogies to computers and programs) leading to an interest in internal mental processes, rather than just in the overt human behaviour. This led to the development of the cognitive mental process model, which is compared to the behaviourist model to outline the distinction of the scope of cognitive psychology in which the components of mental management will be explored in more detail.  Theory  French philosopher and educator Antoine de La Garanderie's research led to creating awareness in individuals on their own mental activities and processes and to make them develop and use them effectively. His theory aimed to establish educational profiles based on the “mental gestures of learning” specific to each child.Plurilingua Publishing. (2019). Make Learning Fun!: Effective teaching methods for your child. According to him, each individual's understanding, memorising and reproducing techniques for information are differentiated. This concept can show the different cognitive mechanisms which play a part in thinking and learning, and ultimately make up mental management. The three main components of mental management include project; evocation; and mental gestures. By defining a project, the learning strategy will differ and the requirements will enable them to implement an effective and appropriate method. Evocation is the voluntary mental reconstruction procedure of all perceptions coming from the external world through senses.Mancinelli, C., Gentili, M., Priori, G., & Valitutti, G. (2004). Concept maps in kindergarten. In Concept maps: Theory, methodology, technology. Proceedings of the first international conference on concept mapping. Pamplona, Spain: Universidad pública de navarra. Evocation is the foundation stone of La Garanderie's theory, allowing individuals to reproduce what they learn at a later point in time. There are three specific profiles of evocation corresponding to a particular channel that the child uses to imagine the information: 1\\\\. Visual evocation includes the transformation of textual information into visual information, for example drawings, diagrams and the use of colour in underlining. 2\\\\. Auditory evocation includes oral or mental repetition of information, for example listening to lessons on an audio device. 3\\\\. Kinaesthetic evocation includes movements, feelings, smells and tastes, for example the use of gestures and movements to learn. Constituting mental management is the organisation, improvement and use of these activities and processes. = Cognitive psychology = Cognitive psychology is the study of the mind as an information processor.McLeod, S. (2015). Cognitive psychology. Retrieved 2 May 2020, from https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive.html It rose to great importance in the mid-1950s due to the dissatisfaction with the behaviourist psychological models. The emphasis of psychology shifted away from studying the mind in favour of understanding human information processing, relating to perception, attention, language, memory, thinking, and consciousness. The main concern of cognitive psychology is how information is received from the senses, processed by the brain and how this processing directs how humans behave. It is a multifaceted approach in which various cognitive functions work together to understand not only individuals and groups, but also society as a whole. = Behaviourist model vs. cognitive model = Mental Management falls within the cognitive model of psychology and needs to be distinguished from the behaviourist model, which considers mental processes to be unobservable and therefore akin to a ‘black box’. More specifically, the behaviourist model assumes that the process linking behaviour to the stimulus cannot be studied. It therefore describes the conceptualisation of psychological disorders in terms of overt behaviour patterns produced by learning and the influence of reinforcement contingencies. Treatment techniques associated with this approach include systematic de-sensitisation and modelling and focusing on modifying ineffective or maladaptive patterns. In contrast, the cognitive model represents a theoretical view of thought and mental operations, provides explanations for observed phenomena and makes predictions about behavioural consequences. Specifically, it describes the mental events that connect the input from the environment with the behavioural output. The approach assumes that people are continually creating and accessing internal representations (models) of what they are experiencing in the world for the purposes of perception, comprehension, and behaviour selection (action). Treatment techniques associated with this approach include cognitive behavioural therapy which involves defining, observing, analysing and interpreting patterns, and reframing these as more optimal ways of thinking.  Processes of mental management  There are five different processes of mental management, which La Garanderie distinguishes as different types of mental gestures. = Attention = In psychology, attention is defined as “a state in which cognitive resources are focused on certain aspects of the environment rather than on others and the central nervous system is in a state of readiness to respond to stimuli.\\"APA Dictionary of Psychology. (2020). Retrieved 12 May 2020, from https://dictionary.apa.org In mental management it describes the essential first step required to enable the subsequent step of retrieving memorized information. The gesture of attention is linked to the perception from our five senses and the evocation of the subject. For example, a parent or teacher can activate a child's attention with instructive phrases using the imperative tense. = Retrieval = Retrieval is defined by the American Psychology Association as \\"the process of recovering or locating information stored in memory. Retrieval is the final stage of memory, after encoding and retention.” These associated stages are dealt with on an implicit basis in mental management. Retrieval is distinguished by La Garanderie as the gesture of memorisation, which involves bringing back evocations for the purpose of reproducing them in the short-, medium-, and long-term. = Comprehension = Comprehension is defined as the “act or capability of understanding something, especially the meaning of a communication,” by the American Psychology Association. It involves making sense in a subjective sense which does not require the understanding to be correct. La Garanderie distinguishes comprehension as the gesture of understanding, which allows us to constantly shift between what is perceived and what is evoked in order to find the meaning of new information. = Thinking = The American Psychology Association defines thinking as a “cognitive behaviour in which ideas, images, mental representations or other hypothetical elements of thought are experienced or manipulated.” In the context of mental management, the thinking process also involves “self-reflection” which involves the “examination, contemplation and analysis of ones thoughts, feeling and actions”. Thinking, or the gesture of reflection, involves selecting the notions or theory that has already been learnt, and allow us to think through the task to be accomplished. = Imagining = Imagination is the faculty that produces ideas and images in the absence of direct sensory data, often by combining fragments of previous sensory experiences into new syntheses. It is a critical component of mental management as it captures the change involved in improving or optimising the mental processes. The gesture of creative imagination allows for an individual to invent new approaches based on what they already know. This allows individuals to make comparisons and develop responses to problems outside of a logical framework.  Measurement of mental processes  The measurement of mental processes can involve invasive or non-invasive ways to measure human activity in the brain, known as neuroimaging. Neuroimaging is defined as “a clinical specialty concerned with producing images of the brain by non-invasive techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.”Definition of MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. (2020). Retrieved 22 May 2020, from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ Computed tomography is “radiography in which a three-dimensional image of a body structure is constructed by computer from a series of plane cross-sectional images made along an axis.” Magnetic resonance imaging, commonly referred to as MRI, is “a noninvasive diagnostic technique that produces computerised images of internal body tissues and is based on nuclear magnetic resonance of atoms within the body induced by the application of radio waves.” These advances help to understand brain specificity, and therefore were able to contribute to theories of mental management processes. Through these methods of measuring mental processes, it was found that different parts of the brain are responsible for different mental processes, for example that the frontal lobe is responsible for abstract thinking.  Practical applications of mental management  The principles of mental management apply practically to many aspects in the real world, particularly in the areas of education and individual development. To develop the mental management processes in education, necessary knowledge, skills, methods and techniques are taught to students in order to help them understand how their minds work and to help them discover the ways to work their minds more efficiently in the education process. These teachings are carried out in three steps: (1) getting to know the mind; (2) developing skills; and (3) attaining mental independence. These practices are now being applied beyond education at an individual level in the context of self-improvement as well as in the work domain, including managers and leaders. Mental management theories were applied to a real-life case study in Mancinelli, Gentili, Priori, and Valituttis’ 2004 study on concept maps in kindergarten. The study's finding was that real learning is derived from the child's evocation, as defined by La Garanderie. Evocation is the voluntary mental reconstruction procedure of all perceptions coming from the external world through senses. The project concluded that the child builds meanings of their senses through evocation, with perception and evocation both key in specifying the information to learn from. Without such a mental activity, learning is partial and lacks important parts. Further findings showed that the observer's mental characteristics affect the contents derived by the child from observation. The interaction, perception and evocation processes unveil correct concepts and misconceptions. Utilising methods of La Garanderie's pedagogic dialogue, children were reached mentally and disclosed their thoughts on their experience. The child's thoughts were found to be guided by the project's success or failure and accordingly the child's thoughts divert from their infantile characteristics and progress and adjust slowly.

The Epic of Sundiata In the Epic of Sundiata, Naré Maghann Konaté (also called Maghan Kon Fatta or Maghan the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a divine hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konaté married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king.

The label ‘arabicised’ is due to the belief that Ishmael spoke Hebrew until he got to Mecca, where he married a Yemeni woman and learnt Arabic. Both genealogical lines go back to Sem, son of Noah, but only Adnanites can claim Abraham as their ascendant, and the lineage of Mohammed, the Seal of Prophets (khatim al-anbiya'), can therefore be traced back to Abraham. Contemporary historiography unveiled the lack of inner coherence of this genealogical system and demonstrated that it finds insufficient matching evidence; the distinction between Qahtanites and Adnanites is even believed to be a product of the Umayyad Age, when the war of factions (al-niza al-hizbi) was raging in the young Islamic Empire.\\" Muhammad claims descent from Ishmael through the Hashim tribe.

Adnan was the ancestor of the Adnani Arabs of northern, central and western Arabia and a direct descendant of Isma'il. It is not confirmed how many generations are between them; however, Adnan was fairly close to Isma'il. Isma'il had twelve sons who are said to have become twelve tribal chiefs throughout the regions from Havilah to Shur (from Assyria to the border of Egypt). Genealogists differ from which son of Isma'il the main line of descent came, either through his eldest son Nabut, or his second son Qedar who was the father of the North Arabian Qedarite tribe that controlled the region between the Persian Gulf and the Sinai Peninsula. Genealogists also differ in the names on the line of descent.

The exact interpretation of some of the canons (ii., iii., xvii.) is debated. Canon iv. is alleged to be in conflict with a decretal of Pope Siricius; and ii. and xviii. betray an inclination to resist the introduction of Roman customs. Canon XVI determines that a person who has been possessed by a demon cannot be ordained, and if they have been ordained, they must be deposed. Canon XXVI requires that married men must not be ordained deacons until they have sworn chastity. Canon XXVII requires that if an ordained deacon should have sex with his wife, then he should be deposed. These canons were confirmed at the Synods of Arles about 443. The canons of the first council are often cited in the modern debates over the ordination of women to the priesthood.

Herodicus () was a Greek physician of the 5th century BC, a native of Selymbria. The first use of therapeutic exercise for the treatment of disease and maintenance of health is credited to him, and he is believed to have been one of the tutors of Hippocrates. He also recommended good diet and massage using beneficial herbs and oils, and his theories are considered the foundation of sports medicine. He was specific in the manner that a massage should be given. He recommended that rubbing be initially slow and gentle, then subsequently faster, with the application of more pressure, which was to be followed by more gentle friction.Early American Manual Therapy (Version 5.0) - Chapter 1 History and Development of Mechanical Vibration Therapy , Accessed: October 6, 2008. \\"IN THE 5TH CENTURY HERODICUS advocated exercise for the treatment of disease and compelled his patients to have their bodies rubbed, he being a firm believer in the efficacy of massage. JOSEPH SCHREIBER, M. D., author of \\"Treatment of Massage and Exercise,\\" translated by Walter Mendelson, M. D., of New York, claims that Herodicus first laid down principles for rational, mechanical methods of treatment. HERODICUS, 484 B. C., was one of the first to refer to the manner of giving massage. He said friction should be gentle and slow at first, then rapid in combination with pressure, which was to be followed by gentle friction. Other advocates were Plato, Socrates, and Hippocrates, who said \\"rubbing can bind a joint that is too loose, and loosen a joint that is too rigid. Hard rubbing binds, soft rubbing loosens, much rubbing causes parts to waste, moderate rubbing makes them grow.\\" This is the earliest definite information relative to the effect of variations in the application of massage. These maxims should be remembered by those who use mechanical vibration for they well define its general therapeutic application. Hipppocrates also suggested the direction in which to apply massage the art of rubbing up, thereby assisting mechanical and physical processes, aiding circulation, relieving stasis and consequently quickening metabolic processes.\\" Herodicus is also described as a gymnastic-master (παιδοτρίβης) and a sophist. According to Plato, Herodicus recommended that his patients walk from Athens to Megara, a distance of a little more than 20 miles.

Hong Kong, 1953. Hsuan Hua (; April 16, 1918 - June 7, 1995), also known as An Tzu and Tu Lun, was a monk of Chan Buddhism and a contributing figure in bringing Chinese Buddhism to the United States in the 20th century. Hsuan Hua founded several institutions in the US. The Dharma Realm Buddhist AssociationDRBA Founder's Bio (DRBA) is a Buddhist organization with chapters in North America, Australia and Asia. The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas (CTTB) in Ukiah, California, is one of the first Chan Buddhist monasteries in America. Venerable Master Hsuan Hua founded Dharma Realm Buddhist University at CTTB. The Buddhist Text Translation Society works on the phonetics and translation of Buddhist scriptures from Chinese into English, Vietnamese, Spanish, and many other languages. Early life Hsuan Hua, a native of Shuangcheng County of Jilin (now Wuchang District, Harbin, Heilongjiang), was born Bai Yushu () on April 16, 1918. His parents were devout Buddhists. At an early age, Hua became a vegetarian like his mother, and decided to become a Buddhist monk. At the age of 15, he took refuge in the Three Jewels under the Venerable Chang Zhi. That same year he began to attend school and studied texts of various Chinese schools of thought, and the fields of medicine, astrology, and physiology. At 19 years of age, Hua became a monastic, under the Dharma name An Tzu. () Bringing Chinese Buddhism to the United States In 1959, Hsuan Hua sought to bring Chinese Buddhism to the West.Epstein, Ronald (1995). \\"The Venerable Master Hsuan Hua Brings the Dharma to the West.\\" In Memory of the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua, Volume One.

He instructed his disciples in America to establish a Buddhist association, initially known as The Buddhist Lecture Hall, which was renamed the Sino-American Buddhist Association before taking its present name: the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association. Hsuan Hua traveled to Australia in 1961 and taught there for one year, returning to Hong Kong in 1962. That same year, at the invitation of American Buddhists, he traveled to the United States; his intent was to \\"come to America to create Patriarchs, to create Buddhas, to create Bodhisattvas\\".Prebish, Charles (1995). \\"Ethics and Integration in American Buddhism\\". Journal of Buddhist Ethics, Vol. 2, 1995. =San Francisco= Hsuan Hua resided in San Francisco, where he built a lecture hall. Hsuan Hua began to attract young Americans who were interested in meditation. He conducted daily meditation sessions and frequent Sutra lectures. At that time, the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union, and Hsuan Hua embarked on a fasting period for thirty-five days to pray for an end to the hostilities and for world peace. In 1967, Hsuan Hua moved the Buddhist Lecture Hall back to Chinatown, locating it in the Tianhou Temple. =First American Sangha= In 1968, Hsuan Hua held a Shurangama Study and Practice Summer Session. Over thirty students from the University of Washington in Seattle came to study the Buddha’s teachings. After the session was concluded, five young Americans (Bhikṣu Heng Chyan, Heng Jing, and Heng Shou, and Bhikṣuṇīs Heng Yin and Heng Ch'ih) requested permission to take full ordination. Venerable Hsuan Hua lectured on the entire ' in 1968 while he was in the United States. These lectures were recorded in an eight-part series of books containing the sutra and a traditionally rigorous form of commentary that addresses each passage. It was again lectured by the original translator monks and nuns of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas at Dharma Realm Buddhist University in the summer of 2003. Vision of American Buddhism With the founding of his American Sangha, Hsuan Hua embarked on his personal vision for Buddhism in the United States: * Bringing the true and proper teachings of the Buddha to the West and establishing a proper monastic community of the fully ordained Sangha here * Organizing and supporting the translation of the entire Buddhist canon into English and other Western languagesEpstein, Ronald (1969). “The Heart Sūtra and the Commentary of Tripiṭaka Master Hsüan Hua.” Master’ Thesis, University of Washington.Epstein, Ronald (1975). “The Śūraṅgama-sūtra with Tripiṭaka Master Hsüan-hua’s Commentary An Elementary Explanation of Its General Meaning: A Preliminary Study and Partial Translation.” Ph.D. Dissertation. University of California at Berkeley. * Promoting wholesome education through the establishment of schools and universities =Hosting ordination ceremonies= Because of the increasing numbers of people who wished to become monks and nuns under Hsuan Hua's guidance, in 1972 he decided to hold ordination ceremonies at Gold Mountain Dhyana Monastery. Two monks and one nun received ordination. Subsequent ordination platforms have been held at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in 1976, 1979, 1982, 1989, 1991, and 1992, and progressively larger numbers of people have received full ordination. Over two hundred people from countries all over the world were ordained under him. =Theravada and Mahayana traditions= Having traveled to Thailand and Burma in his youth to investigate the Southern Tradition of Buddhism, Hsuan Hua wanted to bridge what he perceived as a rift between the Northern (Mahayana) and Southern (Theravada) traditions. In an address to Ajahn Sumedho and the monastic community at Amaravati Buddhist Monastery on October 6, 1990, Hsuan Hua stated:Hsuan Hua. The Shurangama Sutra with Commentary, Volume 7. 2003. p. 261 On the occasion of the opening ceremony for the Dharma Realm Buddhist University, Hsuan Hua presented Venerable K. Sri Dhammananda of the Theravada tradition with an honorary Ph.D. He also donated a major piece of the land that would become Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery, a Theravada Buddhist monastery in the Thai Forest tradition of Ajahn Chah, located in Redwood Valley, California. Hsuan Hua would also invite Bhikkhus from both traditions to jointly conduct the High Ordination. =Chinese and American Buddhism= From July 18 to the 24th of 1987, Hsuan Hua hosted the Water, Land, and Air Repentance Dharma Assembly, a centuries-old ritual often seen as the \\"king of dharma services\\" in Chinese Buddhism, at the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas and invited over seventy Buddhists from mainland China to attend. This was the first time the service was known to have been held in North America. On November 6, 1990, Hsuan Hua sent his disciples to Beijing to bring the Dragon Treasury () edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon back to CTTB, furthering his goal of bringing Buddhism to the US. Death On June 7, 1995, Hsuan Hua died in Los Angeles at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His sudden passing came as a shock to most of his disciples. =Funeral= Hsuan Hua's funeral lasted from June 8 to July 29. On June 17, Hsuan Hua's body was taken from southern to northern California, returning to the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas. All major services during the funeral were presided over by Venerable Ming Yang, abbot of Longhua Temple in Shanghai and a longtime friend of Hsuan Hua's. On July 28, monks from both Theravada and Mahayana traditions hosted a memorial ceremony and cremation. More than two thousand followers from the United States, Canada, and various Asian and European countries, came to CTTB to take part in the funeral service. Letters of condolences from Buddhist monks and dignitaries, including from President Bush, were read during the memorial service. A day after the cremation, July 29, Hsuan Hua's ashes were scattered in the air above the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas by two disciples, Heng Sure and Heng Chau, one of Master Hua's first disciples, from a hot air balloon. After the funeral, memorial services commemorating Hsuan Hua's life were held in various parts of the world, including Taiwan, China, and Canada. His śarīra (relics) were distributed to many of his temples, disciples and followers.

He won five consecutive ICC Umpire of the Year awards between 2004 and 2008, and was generally considered to have been the best umpire in the world during his time.Taufel is Umpire of Year again Cricinfo. Retrieved September 2008 He announced his retirement from international cricket on 26 September 2012, after the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 final. He subsequently worked as the ICC's Umpire Performance and Training Manager until October 2015.  Playing career  Taufel played for Cammeray Cricket Club in the Northern Suburbs Cricket Association as a fast-medium bowler. After the 1990–1991 season he won the club's best and fairest award, was leading wicket-taker and had the lowest bowling average in the association. His career was cut short by a back injury. Umpiring career Despite initially having no intention of becoming an umpire, he agreed to go along with a friend to an umpiring course. After he passed the subsequent exam he began umpiring grade cricket. He quickly progressed through the ranks and made his first-class debut in 1995, aged just 24. =International cricket= Taufel stood in his first One Day International (ODI) on 13 January 1999 in the match between Australia and Sri Lanka at Sydney when he was 27 years old. He umpired his first Test match in December 2000 – the Boxing Day Test between Australia and West Indies at Melbourne. He became a member of the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires in 2002. He was chosen to umpire at the 2003 Cricket World Cup.Simon Taufel : Australian Cricket Umpire Statistics Taufel has been named the top umpire of the year five times, and in August 2006 the ICC's annual umpire review officially ranked second for accuracy (behind Darrell Hair), and top overall. He umpired in the final of the 2004 Champions Trophy. At the 2006 Champions Trophy he umpired a semi-final, but could not umpire the final because Australia had reached the final. In January 2007 he became the youngest umpire to stand in 100 ODIs, and in April 2007 took charge of the World Cup semi-final between New Zealand and Sri Lanka, again being ineligible for the final which featured Australia. He umpired alongside Aleem Dar in the final of the 2011 Cricket World Cup between Sri Lanka and India, gaining the opportunity to do so after Australia were knocked out by India in the Quarter Finals. On 3 March 2009, Taufel was one of the officials caught in the attack on the Sri Lanka cricket team by terrorists in Lahore, Pakistan. He along with Chris Broad criticised the Pakistan security forces' response to the incident. Taufel quit international cricket after the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, at which he was umpiring at the time.

Biography  Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau was born in Paris in 1700, the son of Alexandre Duhamel, lord of Denainvilliers. In his youth he developed a passion for botany, but at his father's wish he studied law from 1718 to 1721. After inheriting his father's large estate, he expanded it into a model farm, where he developed and tested new methods of horticulture, agriculture and forestry. The results of this work, he published in numerous publications. Commission by the French Academy of Sciences in 1728 Duhamel investigate the saffron cultivation in Gâtinais. In the following years continued to investigate physiological problems of crops. He also investigated growth of the trees in cooperation with Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon. From 1740 he also started focusing on meteorological problems, in particular their impact on agricultural production. In 1738 he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences, and served three times as its president. He was appointed Inspector-General of the Marine in 1739, and made scientific studies of shipbuilding, the conservation of wood, the paramedical and fair of sailors, etc. In 1741 he co-founded a school of Marine science, which in 1765 became the Ecole des Ingénieurs- Constructeurs, the forerunner of the modern Ecole du Génie Maritime. He was also involved in the foundation of the \\"Académie de marine de Brest\\", on 31 July 1752. Following the work of Réaumur, in 1757 he released the Description des Arts et Métiers and opposed the writers of the Encyclopédie. His fondness for concrete problems, experimentation and popularization made him one of the forerunners of modern agronomy and silviculture. In 1767, du Monceau was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died in Paris on 13 August 1782.  Work  From \\"Traité général des pesches\\" = Horticultural experiments in plant physiology = Having been requested by the French Academy of Sciences to investigate a disease which was destroying the saffron plant in Gâtinais, he discovered the cause in a parasitical fungus which attached itself to the roots. This achievement gained him admission to the French Academy of Sciences in 1738. From then on until his death he busied himself chiefly with making experiments in plant physiology. Having learned from Sir Hans Sloane that madder possesses the property of giving colour to the bones, he fed animals successively on food mixed and unmixed with madder; and he found that their bones in general exhibited concentric strata of red and white, while the softer parts showed in the meantime signs of having been progressively extended. From a number of experiments he was led to believe himself able to explain the growth of bones, and to demonstrate a parallel between the manner of their growth and that of trees. Along with the naturalist Buffon, he made numerous experiments on the growth and strength of wood, and experimented also on the growth of the mistletoe, on layer planting, on smut in corn, and others. He was probably the first, in 1736, to distinguish clearly between the alkalis, potash and soda. = Meteorological observations = From the year 1740 on he made meteorological observations, and kept records of the influence of the weather on agricultural production. For many years he was inspector-general of the marine, and applied his scientific experience to the improvement of naval construction. = About the division of labour = In his additions to lArt de lÉpinglier (The Art of the Pin-Maker, 1761), Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau wrote about the \\"division of labour\\": :There is nobody who is not surprised of the small price of pins; but we shall be even more surprised, when we know how many different operations, most of them very delicate, are mandatory to make a good pin. We are going to go through these operations in a few words to stimulate the curiosity to know their detail; this enumeration will supply as many articles which will make the division of this labour... The first operation is to have brass go through the drawing plate to calibrate it. This text is believed to have inspired Adam Smith for his famous work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations published in 1776. = Criticism by the Encyclopedists = Illustration of the Encyclopédie (vol 2b-181) article \\"Rope\\", that Duhamel wrote. Following the work of René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, in 1757 Duhamel released the Descriptions des Arts et Métiers and opposed the writers of the Encyclopédie. The Encyclopédistes didn't take this for granted, Criticised him on occasion. For example, Denis Diderot (1767) recalled: :This Duhamel has invented an infinity of machines which serve no purpose, has written and translated a multitude of books on agriculture, of which it is not known if they have any useful result, that is still awaited.Denis Diderot. Oeuvres complètes de Diderot: revues sur les éditions originales, comprenant ce qui a été publié à diverses époques et les manuscrits inédits, conservés à la Bibliothèque de lErmitage, notices, notes, table analytique, Volume 11. Garnier frères, 1767. p. 366 :- Denis Diderot, 1767. Diderot seems to forget his debt to Duhamel du Monceau for the Encyclopédie, including the articles \\"Agriculture,\\" \\"Rope,\\" \\"Pipe\\" and \\"Sugar.\\" The succession of Grandjean Fouchy, perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, clash sees supporters of Condorcet, led by d'Alembert, and those of the astronomer Bailly, led by Count de Buffon. In 1773, the appointment of Condorcet as deputy Grandjean Fouchy sees the triumph of the party of the philosophers against the use of naval officers linked to Duhamel. But in January 1775, supporters of Bailly, including Patrick D'Arcy and Jean-Charles de Borda, both naval officers make up a commission to monitor the work of the Secretary, that Condorcet considered censorship. To be elected, he must give up the pension ECU 1000 and submit an application in proper form to respect the rules of Académie2. Condorcet would later refer to this episode: : \\"Though he loved many innovations in science and devoted his life to introduce useful ones in the arts, he didn't like them in politics and even less in the statutes of the academies\\" :- Marquis de Condorcet, 1738Marquis de Condorcet.

In 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. A collection of ten of King's films was released as a collection representing various stages of his life. King's work was also the focus of a retrospective at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2007 New York City's Museum of Modern Art hosted a retrospective of his work.\\"MoMA retrospective celebrates veteran filmmaker Allan King\\". CBC News, April 24, 2007. In 2009, there were similar tributes to King's work at Vancouver's Pacific Cinematheque and the Vancouver International Film Centre \\"Rudy Buttignol reminisces about Canadian documentary great Allan King\\". The Georgia Straight, September 16, 2009. King married three times: first to Phyllis April King in 1952, then to screenwriter Patricia Watson in 1970, and finally to screenwriter Colleen Murphy in 1987. He collaborated with both Watson and Murphy on film projects. He wrote Who Has Seen the Wind with Watson in 1976 and directed Murphy's screenplay for Termini Station in 1989. Pre-eminent documentarian For his films, King used the documentary technique cinema-verite. He ran Allan King Films Limited in Toronto. King described his style as \\"actuality drama – filming the drama of everyday life as it happens, spontaneously without direction, interviews or narrative.\\" He said that he wanted to \\"serve the action as unobtrusively as possible\\" by becoming very familiar with both the environment and the people he filmed by paying particular attention to movement patterns, routines, and light quality. Warrendale Warrendale was a film about emotionally- disturbed children who lived in a Toronto institution with the same name. Warrendale used an experimental \\"holding\\" technique of safely restraining children who lost control because of fear, rage, or grief. The therapy was designed to push children to verbalize their emotions so that they would learn to identify and deal with their emotions, and it was also supposed to replace drugs or other techniques. The film was not an exposé of holding and neither chastised nor applauded the school's approach, but it was instead an absorbing, empathetic glimpse of children in distress. Unlike Frederick Wiseman, who spent only a short time exploring an institution before he began filming, King spent much time with subjects beforehand so that he would develop trust with his subjects. King spent four weeks at Warrendale with 12 children and another two weeks there with his camera crew before filming began. The crew had complete access to all aspects of the home/school situation at Warrendale, including one meeting in which the top school administrator gently admonished a counselor for using holding at an inappropriate time. King lit the entire home and replaced dark paneling in a hallway with lighter paneling to improve the lights. Filming lasted eight weeks. He said that getting to know people before filming and staying with situations for a significant amount of time were essential \\"because in order for anything significant to occur in action or drama the subjects must make a huge leap of faith in the filmmaker.\\" The film's pivotal moment was the counselors breaking the news to the children that their cook, Dorothy, had died suddenly. (Although the death had happened early during the filming, King made it the film's climax.) The children with emotional illnesses often believed that their thoughts and feelings caused trauma and tragedy. Filming was intimate during both the tensest and the most tender moments, with the camera sometimes inches from pained faces as the children screamed and cried, all while they were being restrained by counselors. Upon seeing Warrendale, director Jean Renoir wrote, \\"Allan King is a great artist. His remarkable work exposes one of the most suspenseful action I have ever seen on a screen.\\" The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which commissioned the film, refused to show it because the children often swore and uttered such words as \\"fuck\\" and \\"bullshit,\\" which were not then permitted on Canadian television. Instead, it allowed King to show the film in cinemas. Shown in the Parallel Section at the Cannes Film Festival in 1967, the film won the Prix d'art et d'essai and also shared BAFTA's Best Foreign Film Award with Michaelangelo Antonioni's Blowup and the New York Critics' Circle Award (1968) with Luis Buñuel's Belle de Jour. A Married Couple Despite censorship, King continued to push cultural taboos. In 1969, he directed A Married Couple, which explored a crisis in a real marriage and the issue of choice. The New York Times ' critic Clive Barnes described A Married Couple as \\"quite simply one of the best films I have ever seen.\\" The film was issued by the Criterion Collection. Other genres During more than 50 years of filmmaking, King worked in every film genre except animation, creating an enormous and diverse portfolio. To support his documentaries, King also directed episodic television and feature films. His first dramatic feature film, Who Has Seen the Wind (1976), based on the novel by W. O. Mitchell, won the Grand Prix at the Paris International Film Festival and the Golden Reel Award for the highest-grossing Canadian film of the year. Many television dramas that he directed won top awards. In 2003, he produced the documentary, Dying at Grace, a docudrama about five people in their final days at the Palliative Care Unit of the Salvation Army Toronto Grace Health Centre as they came to terms with their deaths. It won awards at film festivals in Toronto and Berlin. Death King died from brain cancer on June 15, 2009, at 79, in his home in Toronto.\\"Canadian documentary maker Allan King dies at 79\\".

The Good Guys was founded in 1973 by Ron Unkefer on Chestnut Street, San Francisco. By 2006, all of the company's stores had closed. WOW!

Tower's founder Russell Solomon reportedly liked the end result and two more WOW! Multimedia Superstores were opened, one in Long Beach, CA, where Neil Diamond played at the grand opening and another opened in Thousand Oaks, CA. By 2006, Tower was bankrupt and Good Guys was being consolidated into CompUSA and thus all of these stores closed. Re-launch After all The Good Guys stores closed, CompUSA began marketing all California and Hawaii stores as CompUSA with The Good Guys Inside in response to Best Buy's new marketing campaign with Magnolia Inside. However, this marketing campaign was dropped in an attempt to further separate CompUSA from the Good Guys name, and assist in launching its new Home Entertainment sections in select locations. The Good Guys name once again no longer existed in 2008 when CompUSA closed its remaining stores. Extended warranties on televisions purchased through The Good Guys or CompUSA can still be accessed through General Electric Extended Warranties.

It covers an area of and is located in the subtropical Inner Terai lowlands of south- central Nepal in the districts of Nawalpur, Parsa, Chitwan and Makwanpur. In altitude it ranges from about in the river valleys to in the Churia Hills. In the north and west of the protected area the Narayani-Rapti river system forms a natural boundary to human settlements. Adjacent to the east of Chitwan National Park is Parsa National Park, contiguous in the south is the Indian Tiger Reserve Valmiki National Park.

History Since the end of the 19th century Chitwan – Heart of the Jungle – used to be a favorite hunting ground for Nepal's ruling class during the cool winter seasons. Until the 1950s, the journey from Kathmandu to Nepal's south was arduous as the area could only be reached by foot and took several weeks. Comfortable camps were set up for the feudal big game hunters and their entourage, where they stayed for a couple of months shooting hundreds of tigers, rhinoceroses, leopards and sloth bears.Gurung, K. K. (1983). Heart of the Jungle: the Wildlife of Chitwan, Nepal. André Deutsch, London. In 1950, Chitwan's forest and grasslands extended over more than and was home to about 800 rhinos. When poor farmers from the mid-hills moved to the Chitwan Valley in search of arable land, the area was subsequently opened for settlement, and poaching of wildlife became rampant. In 1957, the country's first conservation law inured to the protection of rhinos and their habitat. In 1959, Edward Pritchard Gee undertook a survey of the area, recommended creation of a protected area north of the Rapti River and of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of ten years. After his subsequent survey of Chitwan in 1963, this time for both the Fauna Preservation Society and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, he recommended extension of the sanctuary to the south. By the end of the 1960s, 70% of Chitwan's jungles had been cleared, malaria eradicated using DDT, thousands of people had settled there, and only 95 rhinos remained. The dramatic decline of the rhino population and the extent of poaching prompted the government to institute the Gaida Gasti – a rhino reconnaissance patrol of 130 armed men and a network of guard posts all over Chitwan. To prevent the extinction of rhinos the Chitwan National Park was gazetted in December 1970, with borders delineated the following year and established in 1973, initially encompassing an area of .Adhikari, T.

When the first protected areas were established in Chitwan, Tharu communities were forced to relocate from their traditional lands. They were denied any right to own land and thus forced into a situation of landlessness and poverty. When the Chitwan National Park was designated, Nepalese soldiers destroyed the villages located inside the boundary of the park, burned down houses, and beat the people who tried to plough their fields. Some threatened Tharu people at gun point to leave. In 1977, the park was enlarged to its present area of . In 1997, a bufferzone of was added to the north and west of the Narayani-Rapti river system, and between the south- eastern boundary of the park and the international border to India. The park's headquarters is in Kasara. Close by the gharial and turtle conservation breeding centres have been established. In 2008, a vulture breeding centre was inaugurated aiming at holding up to 25 pairs of each of the two Gyps vultures species now critically endangered in Nepal - the Oriental white-backed vulture and the slender-billed vulture. Climate Chitwan has a tropical monsoon climate with high humidity all through the year. The area is located in the central climatic zone of the Himalayas, where monsoon starts in mid June and eases off in late September. During these 14–15 weeks most of the 2,500 mm yearly precipitation falls – it is pouring with rain. After mid-October the monsoon clouds have retreated, humidity drops off, and the top daily temperature gradually subsides from ±36 °C / 96.8 °F to ±18 °C / 64.5 °F. Nights cool down to 5 °C / 41.0 °F until late December, when it usually rains softly for a few days. Then temperatures start rising gradually. Vegetation Seed of kapok, the silk cotton tree The typical vegetation of the Inner Terai is Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests with predominantly sal trees covering about 70% of the national park area. The purest stands of sal occur on well drained lowland ground in the centre. Along the southern face of the Churia Hills sal is interspersed with chir pine (Pinus roxburghii). On northern slopes sal associates with smaller flowering tree and shrub species such as beleric (Terminalia bellirica), rosewood (Dalbergia sissoo), axlewood (Anogeissus latifolia), elephant apple (Dillenia indica), grey downy balsam (Garuga pinnata) and creepers such as Bauhinia vahlii and Spatholobus parviflorus. Seasonal bushfires, flooding and erosion evoke an ever-changing mosaic of riverine forest and grasslands along the river banks. On recently deposited alluvium and in lowland areas groups of catechu (Acacia catechu) with rosewood (Dalbergia sissoo) predominate, followed by groups of kapok (Bombax ceiba) with rhino apple trees (Trewia nudiflora), the fruits of which rhinos savour so much. Understorey shrubs of velvety beautyberry (Callicarpa macrophylla), hill glory bower (Clerodendrum sp.) and gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica) offer shelter and lair to a wide variety of species. Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands cover about 20% of the park's area. More than 50 species are found here including some of the world's tallest grasses like the elephant grass called Saccharum ravennae, giant cane (Arundo donax), khagra reed (Phragmites karka) and several species of true grasses. Kans grass (Saccharum spontaneum) is one of the first grasses to colonise new sandbanks and to be washed away by the yearly monsoon floods.Shrestha, B. K., Dangol, D. R. (2006). Change in Grassland Vegetation in the Northern Part of Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal. Scientific World, Vol. 4, No. 4: 78–83. Fauna Basking mugger crocodile Chital stag The wide range of vegetation types in the Chitwan National Park is haunt of more than 700 species of wildlife and a not yet fully surveyed number of butterfly, moth and insect species. Apart from king cobra and rock python, 17 other species of snakes, starred tortoise and monitor lizards occur. The Narayani-Rapti river system, their small tributaries and myriads of oxbow lakes is habitat for 113 recorded species of fish and mugger crocodiles. In the early 1950s, about 235 gharials occurred in the Narayani River. The population has dramatically declined to only 38 wild gharials in 2003. Every year gharial eggs are collected along the rivers to be hatched in the breeding center of the Gharial Conservation Project, where animals are reared to an age of 6–9 years. Every year young gharials are reintroduced into the Narayani-Rapti river system, of which sadly only very few survive. =Mammals= Chitwan National Park is home to 68 mammal species. The \\"king of the jungle\\" is the Bengal tiger. The alluvial floodplain habitat of the Terai is one of the best tiger habitats anywhere in the world. Since the establishment of Chitwan National Park the initially small population of about 25 individuals increased to 70–110 in 1980. In some years this population has declined due to poaching and floods. In a long-term study carried out from 1995 to 2002 tiger researchers identified a relative abundance of 82 breeding tigers and a density of 6 females per . Information obtained from camera traps in 2010 and 2011 indicated that tiger density ranged between 4.44 and 6.35 individuals per . They offset their temporal activity patterns to be much less active during the day when human activity peaked. Indian leopards are most prevalent on the peripheries of the park. They co-exist with tigers, but being socially subordinate are not common in prime tiger habitat. In 1988, a clouded leopard was captured and radio- collared outside the protected area. It was released into the park, but did not stay there. Chitwan is considered to have the highest population density of sloth bears with an estimated 200 to 250 individuals. Smooth-coated otters inhabit the numerous creeks and rivulets. Bengal foxes, spotted linsangs and honey badgers roam the jungle for prey. Striped hyenas prevail on the southern slopes of the Churia Hills.Jnawali, S. R., Baral, H. S., Lee, S., Acharya, K. P., Upadhyay, G. P., Pandey, M., Shrestha, R., Joshi, D., Lamichhane, B. R., Griffiths, J., Khatiwada, A. P., Subedi, N. and Amin, R. (compilers) (2011). The Status of Nepal’s Mammals: The National Red List Series. Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, Kathmandu, Nepal. During a camera trapping survey in 2011, wild dogs were recorded in the southern and western parts of the park, as well as golden jackals, fishing cats, jungle cats, leopard cats, large and small Indian civets, Asian palm civets, crab-eating mongooses and yellow-throated martens. Rhinoceros: since 1973 the population has recovered well and increased to 544 animals around the turn of the century. To ensure the survival of the endangered species in case of epidemics animals are translocated annually from Chitwan to the Bardia National Park and the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve since 1986. However, the population has repeatedly been jeopardized by poaching: in 2002 alone, poachers killed 37 individuals in order to saw off and sell their valuable horns. Chitwan has the largest population of Indian rhinoceros in Nepal, estimated at 605 of 645 individuals in total in the country as of 2015. From time to time wild elephant bulls find their way from Valmiki National Park into the valleys of the park, apparently in search of elephant cows willing to mate. Gaurs spend most of the year in the less accessible Churia Hills in the south of the national park. But when the bush fires ease off in springtime and lush grasses start growing up again, they descend into the grassland and riverine forests to graze and browse. The Chitwan population of the world's largest wild cattle species has increased from 188 to 368 animals in the years 1997 to 2016. Furthermore, 112 animals were counted in the adjacent Parsa Wildlife Reserve. The animals move freely between these parks.Bison population increasing in Chitwan National Park (2016). https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/bison- population-increasing-cnp/ Apart from numerous wild boars also sambar deer, red muntjac, hog deer and herds of chital inhabit the park. Four-horned antelopes reside predominantly in the hills. Rhesus monkeys, hanuman langurs, Indian pangolins, Indian porcupines, several species of flying squirrels, black-naped hares and endangered hispid hares are also present. =Birds= Every year dedicated bird watchers and conservationists survey bird species occurring all over the country. In 2006 they recorded 543 species in the Chitwan National Park, much more than in any other protected area in Nepal and about two-thirds of Nepal's globally threatened species. Additionally, 20 black-chinned yuhina, a pair of Gould's sunbird, a pair of blossom-headed parakeet and one slaty-breasted rail, an uncommon winter visitor, were sighted in spring 2008. Especially the park's alluvial grasslands are important habitats for the critically endangered Bengal florican, the vulnerable lesser adjutant, grey-crowned prinia, swamp francolin and several species of grass warblers. In 2005 more than 200 slender-billed babblers were sighted in three different grassland types. The near threatened Oriental darter is a resident breeder around the many lakes, where egrets, bitterns, storks and kingfishers also abound. The park is one of the few known breeding sites of the globally threatened spotted eagle. Peafowl and jungle fowl scratch their living on the forest floor. Apart from the resident birds about 160 migrating and vagrant species arrive in Chitwan in autumn from northern latitudes to spend the winter here, among them the greater spotted eagle, eastern imperial eagle and Pallas's fish-eagle. Common sightings include brahminy ducks and goosanders. Large flocks of bar-headed geese just rest for a few days in February on their way north. As soon as the winter visitors have left in spring, the summer visitors arrive from southern latitudes. The calls of cuckoos herald the start of spring. The colourful Bengal pittas and several sunbird species are common breeding visitors during monsoon. Among the many flycatcher species the paradise flycatcher with his long undulating tail in flight is a spectacular sight.

The board appoints a chief executive officer who has responsibility for day-to-day operations, including hiring of employees. The NES purchases their power from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federally owned utility which serves Tennessee and parts of six surrounding states. In 2016, the sources of electricity purchased by the NES from TVA included 39.8% nuclear, 25.8% coal-fired, 21.5% natural gas-fired, 9.7% hydroelectric power, and 3.2% from wind and solar. History In 1938, the Tennessee Electric Power Company, the investor-owned utility for the Nashville area since 1922, sued the Tennessee Valley Authority for selling power in Nashville. TEPCO lost the suit, and was broken up in 1939. TVA bought TEPCO's assets for $79 million, while the city of Nashville took over TEPCO's power generation and distribution network and created the Electric Power Board of Nashville to run it. The Board adopted Nashville Electric Service as its operating name, and TEPCO's 500 employees became employees of NES.

(also known as Carson's) is an online retailer founded in 1854 as an American department store, which grew to over 50 locations, primarily in the Midwestern United States. Sold to the holding company of Bon-Ton in 2006, but still operated under the Carson name, the entire Bon-Ton collection of stores, including Carson's, went into bankruptcy and closed in 2018. BonTon's intellectual property was quickly sold while in bankruptcy, and the new owners reopened shortly afterwards as online retail. The Carson Pirie Scott name is associated with the Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building designed by Louis Sullivan, built in 1899 for the retail firm Schlesinger & Mayer, and expanded and sold to Carson Pirie Scott in 1904, and occupied by them for more than a century. History =Beginnings= Carson Pirie Scott logo used between 1946 through 1978. Carson Pirie Scott Logo used from 1978 through the company's sale to Bergner in 1989. The box design and \\"& Co.\\" suffix was dropped in 1986; this later variant of the logo could still be found on older store signage through the company's end. Final Carson Pirie Scott logo before the name was shortened, which adopted the red insignia and font of Bergner's. The chain began in 1854 when Scotsmen Samuel Carson and John Pirie first clerked in the Murray's dry goods store in Peru, Illinois - then opened their own store in LaSalle followed by one in Amboy. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed 60% of the store's stock. John Edwin Scott operated a dry goods store in Ottawa, Illinois. He later moved up to Chicago and became the first partner of Samuel Carson and John T. Pirie in the ownership of a dry goods store, well known today as Carson Pirie Scott & Co. Two of John Scott's sons, Robert L. and Frederick H., were members of the department store firm. In 1961, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. greatly expanded in Illinois by purchasing the 20 unit Block & Kuhl chain headquartered in Peoria. In 1980, to diversify its business, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. borrowed $108 million to buy Dobbs Houses, Inc., an airline caterer and owner of the Toddle House and Steak 'n Egg Kitchen restaurant chains. These were sold in 1988, as was the County Seat clothing chain. In 1989, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. was acquired by P.A. Bergner & Co. (founded in Peoria), who operated the Bergner's, Charles V. Weise, Myers Brothers and Boston Store chains. =Bergner's bankruptcy= In 1991, P.A. Bergner & Co. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; upon emerging from bankruptcy in 1993, it became a NASDAQ publicly traded company, changing its operating name to Carson Pirie Scott & Co. One year later, the company commenced trading on the NYSE under the CRP symbol. =Acquisition by Proffitt's/Saks= By 1998, Carson Pirie Scott & Co. ownership was held by Proffitt's, Inc., (later renamed Saks Incorporated to reflect the acquisition of Saks Fifth Avenue). The Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, and Boston Store chains, along with Younkers and Herberger's nameplates, eventually operated as Saks' Northern Department Store Group (NDSG), based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In late 2005, however, the group was put up for sale as Saks Incorporated tried to refocus itself primarily on its core Saks Fifth Avenue stores. =Sale to The Bon-Ton and store closings= Carson's and its associated stores became part of The Bon-Ton Stores Inc. in a $1.1 billion deal completed on March 6, 2006. The group's merchandising and marketing base remained in Milwaukee. Bon-Ton converted Elder-Beerman stores in Indiana and Michigan to the newly shortened Carson's name in 2011 and 2012. The chain expanded into Metro Detroit in 2013 with the conversion of three Parisian stores. Bon-Ton announced on April 17, 2018 that they would cease operations and began liquidating all 267 stores after two liquidators, Great American Group and Tiger Capital Group, won an auction for the company. The bid was estimated to be worth $775.5 million. This included all remaining Carson's stores after 164 years of operation. According to national retail reporter Mitch Nolen, stores closed within 10 to 12 weeks. =Reopening= The intellectual property of Bon-Ton, including Carson's, was quickly sold in bankruptcy to CSC Generation, and online retail was reopened. The new owners, based in Merrillville, Indiana were also exploring opening new store locations. On October 29, 2018; Under this new ownership and using the same company and stores' names, Bon-Ton started announcing it would reopen the Evergreen Park, Illinois Carson's store on November 24 (Black Friday)–one of Bon-Ton's first brick-and-mortar stores to reopen. Bon-Ton has also announced plans to open brick-and-mortar Carson's stores in Bloomingdale, Lombard and Orland Park. The only location that wound up opening was in Evergreen Park, the company never followed through in Orland Park and Lombard.

His stories, appearing under the pen name, \\"Nessmuk\\" popularized self-guided canoe camping tours of the Adirondack lakes in open, lightweight solo canoes and what is today called ultralight camping or ultralight backpacking. Canoeing had been popularized by Scottish lawyer John MacGregor in the 1860s, but the typical canoe trip of the day employed expert guides and heavy canoes. Sears, who was tall and had a , solo canoe built by J. Henry Rushton of Canton, New York. He named it the Sairy Gamp (the name of a Dickens character) and in it he completed a journey through the central Adirondacks. He was 62 years old and in frail health (tuberculosis and asthma) at the time. William Henry Harrison Murray's Adventures in the Wilderness, published in 1869, had praised the Adirondacks as having a healthy atmosphere for consumptives and Verplanck Colvin's enthusiastic writing about the Adirondack wilderness had further inspired the trip. The Sairy Gamp was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution and is now on loan to the Adirondack Museum. He grew up the eldest of ten children in South Oxford (now Webster), Massachusetts. He took his pen name from a Native American who had befriended him in early childhood. He was fascinated by the few books about Native Americans his family possessed, which left him with an abiding interest in forest life and adventure. A period of factory labor while still a child left him with a fondness for the writing of Charles Dickens. At age twelve he started working in a commercial fishing fleet based on Cape Cod and at nineteen he signed on for a three-year voyage on a whaler headed for the South Pacific; it was the same year (1841) that Herman Melville shipped out of the same port bound for the same whaling grounds. On his return, his family moved to Wellsboro, Pennsylvania where he was to live for the rest of his life. However, he continued traveling for adventure, from the upper Midwest and Ontario to an Amazon tributary in Brazil (in 1867 and again in 1870). Sears wrote Woodcraft, a book on camping, in 1884, that has remained in print ever since. A book of poems, Forest Runes, appeared in 1887. He died at his home in Pennsylvania seven years later.

All planets, comets, and asteroids in the Solar System, and the Sun itself are in such orbits, as are many artificial probes and pieces of debris. The moons of planets in the Solar System, by contrast, are not in heliocentric orbits, as they orbit their respective planet (although the Moon has a convex orbit around the Sun). The barycenter of the Solar System, while always very near the Sun, moves through space as time passes, depending on where other large bodies in the Solar System, such as Jupiter and other large gas planets, are located at that time. A similar phenomenon allows the detection of exoplanets by way of the radial-velocity method. The helio- prefix is derived from the Greek word \\"ἥλιος\\", meaning \\"Sun\\", and also Helios, the personification of the Sun in Greek mythology. The first spacecraft to be put in a heliocentric orbit was Luna 1 in 1959. An incorrectly timed upper-stage burn caused it to miss its planned impact on the Moon.  Trans-Mars injection  Trans-Mars injection diagram. A = Hohmann transfer orbit. B = Conjunction mission. C = Opposition mission A trans-Mars injection (TMI) is a heliocentric orbit in which a propulsive maneuver is used to set a spacecraft on a trajectory, also known as Mars transfer orbit, which will place it as far as Mars's orbit. Every two years, low-energy transfer windows open up, which allow movement between planets with the lowest possible energy requirements. Transfer injections can place spacecraft into either a Hohmann transfer orbit or bi-elliptic transfer orbit. Trans-Mars injections can be either a single maneuver burn, such as that used by the NASA MAVEN orbiter in 2013, or a series of perigee kicks, such as that used by the ISRO Mars Orbiter Mission in 2013.ISRO successfully sends Mars orbiter into sun-centric orbit.Orbiter successfully placed in Mars Transfer Trajectory.

The then Commissioner of Bilaspur objected to it on the ground that as per the Flag Code of India, a private citizen was not permitted to fly the Indian flag except on certain days. Jindal filed a petition before the High Court arguing that no law could forbid Indian citizens from flying the national flag and, furthermore, the Flag Code of India was only a set of executive instructions from the Government of India and therefore not law. While he went out to court against the objections of the government officials, he did not remove the flag from the factory and kept flying it with respect and dignity. The High Court allowed the petition and held the Flag Code of India was not a valid restriction on the right to freedom of expression under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. The High Court observed that, according to Article 19(2), the only valid limitations on this right were those that were contained in statute. In cases concerning the regulation of the flying of the national flag, such limitations could be found in the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950 or the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act 1971. The Union of India filed an appeal against this decision to the Supreme Court on the basis that whether citizens were free to fly the national flag was a policy decision, and could not be subject to court interference. Supreme Court was pleased to grant leave and stay the operation of the impugned judgment. The flag continued to fly as Naveen's lawyer said \\"it would not be contempt of court since the judgement had only been stayed\\". The matter then came up for hearing before the Supreme Court which observed that prima facie they see no reason why citizens cannot express patriotism by displaying the national flag. The court also observed that restrictions on flying of national flag only on certain days by private citizens seemed unsustainable. The Supreme Court on 23 January 2004 dismissed the Civil Appeal No. 2920 of 1996 arising out of SLP No. 1888 of 1996 filed by Union of India against the judgment and order dates 22 September 1995 of Delhi High Court and held that flying the national flag was symbol of expression that came within the right to freedom of expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.http://www.the- laws.com/Encyclopedia/Browse/Case?CaseId=004002801000 Jindal has been strongly advocating to mark 23 January as the \\"National Flag Day\\". While India observes Armed Forces Flag Day on 7 December, it does not have a National Flag day. Controversies Revelations in September 2012 alleged the involvement of him and his company in the alleged Coalgate scam. His company allegedly gained by making and selling power at high prices. The coal blocks allotted to Jindal Power Limited (JPL) in 1998, during the BJP ruled NDA regime, were followed by allocations under the UPA, which have culminated in making the Jindal Group the largest beneficiary of coal block allocations. It has reserves of 2,580 million metric tonnes of coal, while the second largest beneficiary in the private sector has just 1,500 million metric tonnes. It was alleged that despite having the cheapest coal, Jindal sold power at higher prices – Rs 3.85 per unit in 2011–2012, compared to Lanco's Rs 3.67 and NTPC's Rs 2.20. The previous year, JPL had sold power at an even higher rate of Rs 4.30 per unit. The combination of cheap coal and high power prices explains why Jindal posted Rs 17.65 billion as profits, or 60% of its revenues, while Lanco made a profit of just Rs 1.55 billion, just 12% of its revenues. In an exclusive interview with Headlines Today editor Rahul Kanwal, Jindal explained how JSPL's profitability was because of its efficiency. The Supreme Court in its August 2014 judgement pulled up the Central Government's arbitrary allocation policy for coal blocks. The court order did not implicate any private company including Jindal Steel and Power Limited of any wrongdoing. The CBI filed chargesheet in alleged coal scam on 11 June 2013 and the investigation is on the way. It also filed a chargesheet in coal block allocation in Jharkhand on 29 April 2015. The Chhattisgarh High Court directed police to file a rape complaint against Naveen Jindal and his associate in January 2015. However, the probe highlighted that the allegations were fake. Subsequently, an F.I.R was registered against Zee Group Chairman Subhash Chandra and his son Punit Goenka for falsely grafting false charges against Jindal. =Sting against Zee News= On 25 October 2012 Jindal held a press conference in which he showed video evidence where it was clear that some officials of Zee News tried to extort a sum Rs 1 billion from Jindal in return for not running the story of Jindal being involved in the Coal scam. Jindal filed a case against Zee News management and its editors for extorting money. Two Zee News editors Sudhir Choudhary and Samir Ahluwalia were sent to jail and later released on bail. Jindal has petitioned the court to cancel the bail of the two editors. It was said in the petition that the accused has been using Zee news and other media of Zee group to constantly target Jindal and his companies through misinformation and reports. Patiala House court on 6 June 2015 issued notices to the editors Chaudhary and Ahluwalia asking ‘why their bails should not be cancelled’ in the case.

Traditionally an independent village in County Durham, it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead on 1 April 1974. The population taken at the 2011 Census of the Gateshead ward (Crawcrook and Greenside) had increased to 8,841. Location Crawcrook lies midway between Prudhoe in Northumberland and Ryton, also in Tyne and Wear. Local politics In local government, Crawcrook is located in the 'Crawcrook, Greenside and Clara Vale ward'. The ward is at the far west of the borough and borders Northumberland. The Crawcrook and Greenside ward is served by three Labour councillors, Jack Graham, Helen Hughes and Kathleen McCartney. Crawcrook is located within the parliamentary constituency of Blaydon. Its current MP is Labour's Liz Twist. History At the turn of the twentieth century, and in common with the nearby areas of Greenside, Clara Vale and Stargate, Crawcrook was a village with a vibrant coal industry. With major pits such as Emma and Clara, as well as several smaller pits, Crawcrook became a major coal mining centre. However the coal industry collapsed in the village during the 1950s and 1960s. As has happened to a number of other northern English villages employment in tertiary industries has replaced the coal industry. However, Crawcrook's coal mining heritage is still evident; a number of the old miners' homes still exist in the surrounding area, including Clifford Terrace and Morgy Hill near to Crawcrook's main street, and the Simpson Memorial Home in nearby Barmoor. Old wagonways used to transport coal are also still present, although they are now maintained as footpaths. During the 1970s and 1980s, with the creation of the Kepier Chare and Westburn private housing estates, Crawcrook grew significantly in size and became largely suburbanised and is being used increasingly as a commuter village for the conurbation of Tyneside. Amenities and Transport links Unlike many villages of a similar semi-rural character, Crawcrook has maintained its broad range of amenities. Crawcrook main street has several shops including a library, a co-operative food store and two petrol stations. It also has a selection of independent shops including a family run freezer centre/bargain store, which in October 2015 was renovated into a One Stop Store which is still family run, A greengrocers, A butchers, Three gentlemen's barbers, two hairdressing salons, a tanning salon, a number of pubs, a chiropodist, a doctor's surgery, which was rebuilt with a new pharmacy right next door, two veterinary practices and a restaurant. There are also several churches in the village from a number of denominations including Catholic, Pentecostal, Church of England and Methodist. After the closure of Kepier Chare school, the village now has only two primary schools; St Agnes Roman Catholic school and Emmaville school. During 2007, Emmaville school was extended to allow former pupils from Kepier Chare to attend there. In 2009 St Agnes Roman Catholic School relocated to the former Kepier Chare school. There is also a separate private nursery located next to the Doctor's Surgery. The area is also well served by public transport, with regular bus links to Hexham, the MetroCentre, Gateshead and Newcastle Upon Tyne as well as nearby towns and villages such as Ryton, Prudhoe, Chopwell, High Spen and Clara Vale. Crawcrook has its own village park, located in the Garden House Estate area of the village. Created in the 1950s it consists of toddler play equipment, a tennis court/five a side football area, and a bowling green. Other recreational facilities nearby include four golf courses, Tyneside golf club at Ryton, Ryton golf club at Clara Vale, Close House golf club in Wylam, and Prudhoe golf club in Prudhoe. Golf courses slightly further away include Whickham golf club, at Whickham, Garesfield golf club at High Spen and Stocksfield golf club in Stocksfield. Education There are two primary schools in the village. St Agnes RC school, the school of Crawcrook's Roman Catholic parish, and Emmaville primary school. Both schools perform exceedingly well compared to other schools in the Gateshead Local Education Authority and nationally. There was a third school, Kepier Chare school. However, in 2007 it was closed with some pupils transferred to Emmaville school or other local schools In 2010 St Agnes RC school relocated to the former Kepier Chare and is to date still there. Surrounding Area Within less than a mile of Crawcrook's main street and its residential areas, lies farmland and rich countryside, particularly to the west and north of the village. To the west of the village these include farmland and Sled Lane, with its woodland and ponds; Bradley Gardens, a Victorian walled garden and, to the north, more farmland as well as the meadows between Crawcrook and Wylam. Other notable features of Crawcrook's environment include its landed estates, in particular Bradley Hall, and its sand quarries, that have partly encroached on some of its countryside to the north-west of the village. Further down the Tyne valley there are picturesque villages and towns such as Prudhoe, Stocksfield and Corbridge. There are quite a few churches in Crawcrook, one Methodist, one Anglican, and one Roman Catholic (St Agnes). References External links * Census 2001 Summary of the Crawcrook and Greenside Ward.

Paul, 373 U.S. 132 (1963), was a 1963 decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court declined to invalidate a California law that imposed minimum fat content standards on avocados sold in the state, including those imported from other states.. The law prohibited the sale of avocados that did not contain at least 8% oil by weight. Florida, a major avocado producer, employed, for wholesale marketing purposes, a federal standard unrelated to oil content. Most Florida avocados that were marketable at home failed to meet the California standard, because they were a different variety from those sold in California, with a lower fat content. Accordingly, Florida avocado growers brought this suit, arguing (unsuccessfully) that the California law (1) was preempted by federal law, (2) violated equal protection, and (3) unduly burdened and interfered with their right to engage in interstate commerce. The case is widely used in law school casebooks on constitutional law and federal jurisdiction as illustrative of preemption issues.See. e.g., 410 (3d ed. 2006). Background California avocado (Haas) Florida avocado (West Indian) This is a comparison of a West Indian avocado (left) with a Mexican avocado (right) – human hand shows sizes. There are three principal races or groups of avocado: Mexican, Guatemalan and West Indian, named for the areas where they were originally cultivated. Mexican avocados have foliage with an anise scent and small fruits about the size of a plum, with black or purple smooth skin. Guatemalan avocados have larger, blackish-green, rough-skinned fruits. The West Indian avocado has the largest fruits, up to 2 lbs (1 kg), with smooth light green skin. Mexican avocados have the highest oil content; West Indian the lowest. The important cultivars now in commercial production are mostly hybrids between these three original races., Persea americana. In 1925, California enacted a law requiring that \\"all avocados, at the time of picking, and at all times thereafter, shall contain not less than 8 percent of oil, by weight of the avocado excluding the skin and seed.\\"This is now § 792 of California's Agricultural Code. In 1925, practically all the avocados in the United States came from California. The purpose of this legislation was to prevent the marketing of immature avocados, which never ripen properly, but decay or shrivel up and become rubbery and unpalatable. The effect of marketing immature avocados is to antagonize consumers; this increases future sales resistance against buying avocados. In 1925, most of the avocados grown in California were, as they are at the present time, from trees derived from Mexican varieties (e.g. Haas avocados). Such avocados contain at least 8% oil when mature. The Florida avocado growers, however, mostly cultivate West Indian, Guatemalan, and hybrid varieties, which may reach maturity and be acceptable and reach their prime for marketing prior to reaching an 8% oil content, or they may never reach that level of oil content.373 U.S. at 160-61. All members of the Court agreed that there is no health issue; the question is \\"a purely economic one.\\"373 U.S. at 137 n.4, 168-69. The Florida avocado growers objected to the California law because it severely restricts the access of Florida growers to the California market.The Florida growers alleged, at an earlier stage of this case, that California officials had consistently condemned Florida avocados as unfit for sale in California, \\"thus requiring [the Florida growers]—to prevent destruction and complete loss of their shipments—to reship the avocados to and sell them in other States.\\" . While California's avocado maturity standard is provided by statute, Florida's is set by a marketing order under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), a New Deal measure creating a regime of self-government for farmers, designed to \\"promote orderly competition among the South Florida growers\\" of avocados. The marketing orders for avocados are drafted by the South Florida Avocado Administrative Committee, which consists entirely of representatives of the growers concerned. The Secretary of Agriculture invariably adopts the Committee's recommendations for avocado maturity dates, sizes, and weights.373 U.S. at 150-51. =Proceedings in district court= Because the Florida avocado growers sued to enjoin the enforcement against them of the California law because it was unconstitutional, the case was brought before a three-judge district court. The growers challenged the constitutionality of the statute on three grounds: :(1) that, under the Supremacy Clause, the California standard must be deemed displaced by the federal standard for determining the maturity of avocados grown in Florida; :(2) that the application of the California statute to Florida-grown avocados denied appellants the Equal Protection of the Laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and :(3) that its application unreasonably burdened or discriminated against interstate marketing of Florida-grown avocados in violation of the Commerce Clause.373 U.S. at 134-35. At the initial stage of the case, the three-judge district court dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, finding that there was not a current justiciable case or controversy. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court held that the suit was one for a three-judge court and presented a justiciable controversy to be tried on the merits.Jacobsen, 362 U.S. at 85-86. After a trial, the three-judge court denied an injunction against the enforcement of § 792 on the ground that the proofs did not establish that its application to Florida avocados violated any provision of the Federal Constitution. The District Court held for several reasons that the Supremacy Clause did not operate to displace § 792: (1) no actual conflict existed between the statute and the federal marketing orders; (2) neither the AAA nor the marketing orders occupied the field to the exclusion of the state statute, and (3) Congress had not ordained that a federal marketing order was to give a license to Florida producers to \\"market their avocados without further inspection by the states\\" after compliance with the federal maturity test. Rather, the court observed, \\"[t]he Federal law does not cover the whole field of interstate shipment of avocados,\\" but, by necessary implication, leaves the regulation of certain aspects of their distribution to the States. Further, the District Court found no violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because the California statute was applicable on identical terms to Florida and California producers, and was reasonably designed to enforce a traditional and legitimate interest of the State of California in the protection of California consumers. The District Court concluded, finally, that § 792 did not unreasonably burden or discriminate against interstate commerce in out-of-state avocados—that the 8% oil content test served, in practice, only to keep off California grocers' shelves fruit which was unpalatable because prematurely picked. This holding rested, in part, on the conclusion that mature Florida fruit had not been shown to be incapable of attaining 8% oil content, since only a small fraction of Florida avocados of certain varieties in fact failed to meet the California test.373 U.S. at 134–36. Both parties then appealed to the Supreme Court. Ruling of the Supreme Court =Majority opinion= Justice Brennan delivered the majority opinion Justice William J. Brennan delivered the 5-4 opinion of the Court, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren, and Justices John Marshall Harlan II, Potter Stewart, and Arthur J. Goldberg. Supremacy Clause issues The Florida avocado growers' main challenge was under the Supremacy Clause, because some avocados that satisfy the standard set by the AAA marketing order do not satisfy the California 8% oil test. The Court began by putting aside two issues that it considered beside the point. First, \\"a federal license or certificate of compliance with minimum federal standards [does not] immunize[] the licensed commerce from inconsistent or more demanding state regulations.\\"373 U.S. at 141. (To this, the dissent responded that Gibbons v. Ogden is to the contrary.See 373 U.S. at 178 n.21.) Second, it is incorrect to claim that \\"the coexistence of federal and state regulatory legislation should depend upon whether the purposes of the two laws are parallel or divergent.\\" The proper test, the Court said, \\"is whether both regulations can be enforced without impairing the federal superintendence of the field, not whether they are aimed at similar or different objectives.\\" And preemption should be found only when there are \\"persuasive reasons—either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained.\\"373 U.S. at 142. The Court then outlined the different ways preemption occurs. First, a holding of federal exclusion of state law \\"is inescapable, and requires no inquiry into congressional design where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.\\" This would occur, for example, if the federal marketing order forbade the marketing of any avocado testing more than 7% oil, while the California test excluded from the State any avocado measuring less than 8% oil. \\"As to those Florida avocados of the hybrid and Guatemalan varieties which were actually rejected by the California test, the District Court indicated that the Florida growers might have avoided such rejections by leaving the fruit on the trees beyond the earliest picking date permitted by the federal regulations, and nothing in the record contradicts that suggestion.\\"373 U.S. at 142-43. (The dissent pointed out, however, that doing this would shorten the marketing window for those avocados, contrary to the federal scheme. Therefore, \\"inevitable collision between the two schemes of regulation\\" is present.373 U.S. at 176.) Another basis for preemption would be whether \\"the nature of the subject matter, namely, the maturity of avocados, or any explicit declaration of congressional design to displace state regulation require § 792 to yield to the federal marketing orders.\\" The Court said this is not a subject requiring national uniformity. On the contrary, as a regulation of food, \\"the maturity of avocados is a subject matter of the kind this Court has traditionally regarded as properly within the scope of state superintendence,\\" because it is regarded as a matter of \\"peculiarly local concern.\\" The majority distinguished between pre- and post-commerce federal regulation; it said that regulation of standards of the picking, processing, and transportation of agricultural commodities in commerce as properly a field of comprehensive federal regulation, but it should not displace \\"state control over the distribution and retail sale of those commodities in the interests of the consumers of the commodities within the State.\\" Thus a state such as Florida could not prohibit exportation in commerce of federally certified avocados, but another state such as California may regulate their marketing in that state. At least: \\"Such a displacement may not be inferred automatically from the fact that Congress has regulated production and packing of commodities for the interstate market.\\"373 U.S. at 144-45. The Court found it immaterial that this was an economic rather than health and safety measure: \\"neither logic nor precedent invites any distinction between state regulations designed to keep unhealthful or unsafe commodities off the grocer's shelves and those designed to prevent the deception of consumers.\\"373 U.S. at 146. The Court then turned to whether Congress intended that the AAA scheme should displace state law. \\"The settled mandate governing this inquiry, in deference to the fact that a state regulation of this kind is an exercise of the historic police powers of the States, is not to decree such a federal displacement \\"unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\\" There must be \\"an unambiguous congressional mandate to that effect,\\" but the Court concluded, \\"We search in vain for such a mandate.\\" Nothing in the AAA or its legislative history disclosed a \\"comprehensive congressional design.\\"373 U.S. at 147-49. Finally the Court expressed skepticism about the truly federal nature of the scheme: > The regulations show that the Florida avocado maturity standards are drafted > each year not by impartial experts in Washington or even in Florida, but > rather by the South Florida Avocado Administrative Committee, which consists > entirely of representatives of the growers and handlers concerned. It > appears that the Secretary of Agriculture has invariably adopted the > Committee's recommendations for maturity dates, sizes, and weights. Thus, > the pattern which emerges is one of maturity regulations drafted and > administered locally by the growers' own representatives, and designed to do > no more than promote orderly competition among the South Florida growers.373 > U.S. at 150-51. The Court added in a footnote at this point that the avocado > marketing agreement was undertaken chiefly as a \\"self-help program.\\" Id. > n.17. The Court therefore concluded that Congress did not intend \\"to oust or displace state powers to enact the regulation embodied in § 792.\\" Rather: \\"The most plausible inference from the legislative scheme is that the Congress contemplated that state power to enact such regulations should remain unimpaired.\\"373 U.S. at 152. Equal Protection Clause The Court affirmed the district court's conclusion that the state standard does not work an irrational discrimination as between persons or groups of persons.\\" While \\"it may well be\\" that arguably superior tests of maturity could be devised than the 8% oil test, this possibility does not make the state's choice \\"either arbitrary or devoid of rational relationship to a legitimate regulatory interest.\\" That is not a question for the courts to decide, and \\"it is sufficient that, on this record, we should conclude, as we do, that oil content appears to be an acceptable criterion of avocado maturity.\\"373 U.S. at 152. Undue burden on interstate commerce The Court insisted that \\"the present record permits no inference that the California statute had a discriminatory objective.\\" Nor has it been shown that \\"notwithstanding a legitimate state interest in some form of regulation,\\" § 792 \\"exceeded the limits necessary to vindicate that interest\\"; or that § 792 was \\"an illegitimate attempt to control the conduct of producers beyond the borders of California.\\" Nonetheless, the record was inadequate. Much of the proof was directed to other issues than those that would be probative on these points, and the court and parties left it uncertain what evidence entered the record. Therefore, a remand on the Commerce Clause issue was necessary for a new trial on this issue.373 U.S. 152-56. California's cross-appeal California cross-appealed on the ground that the district court should have dismissed the action for want of equity, rather than for lack of merit. The contention is that there was no justiciable controversy and an insufficient showing of injury (there must be an irreparable injury) to the Florida growers to invoke the district court's equity jurisdiction. The Court rejected both arguments. First, in the earlier appeal, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen, the Court had held that, because of the Florida growers' allegations that California officials had consistently condemned Florida avocados as unfit for sale in California, \\"thus requiring [the Florida growers]—to prevent destruction and complete loss of their shipments—to reship the avocados to and sell them in other States.\\" Thus it was evident that \\"there is an existing dispute between the parties as to present legal rights amounting to a justiciable controversy which appellants are entitled to have determined on the merits.\\" Second, even on the present inadequate and ambiguous record, the Florida growers demonstrated sufficient injury to warrant at least a trial of their allegations. It was conceded that the State, in objecting to the growers' proffered evidence, did not dispute the claim that some shipments of Florida avocados had, in fact, been rejected by California for failure to comply with the oil content requirement, to at least the extent of as much as 6.4% of the total shipments of Florida avocados into California. That is enough to warrant a trial on the merits. Furthermore, the case is not moot. It is clear that the California officials will continue to enforce the statute against the Florida-grown avocados, for the State's answer to the complaint declared that these officials \\"have in the past and now stand ready to perform their duties under their oath of office should they acquire knowledge of violations of the Agricultural Code of the State of California.373 U.S. 157-59. =Dissenting opinion= Justice Byron White Justice Byron White filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, and Tom C. Clark. The four-justice dissent addressed only the preemption issue: \\"Since we in the minority have concluded that the Agricultural Adjustment Act and regulations promulgated thereunder leave no room for this inconsistent and conflicting state legislation, we reach only the Supremacy Clause issue.\\"373 U.S. at 160. The dissent invoked the same legal standard for preemption as the majority: > The ultimate question for the Court is whether the California law may > validly apply to Florida avocados which the Secretary or his inspector says > are mature under the federal scheme. We in the minority believe that it > cannot, for, in our view, the California law \\"stands as an obstacle to the > accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of > Congress.\\" Hines v. Davidowitz.373 U.S. at 165. But it reached the opposite legal conclusion: > The central and unavoidable fact is that six out of every 100 Florida > avocados certified as mature by federal standards are turned away from the > California markets as being immature, and are excluded from that State by > the application of a maturity test different from the federal measure. > Congress empowered the Secretary to provide for the orderly marketing of > avocados, and to specify the quality and maturity of avocados to be > transported in interstate commerce to any and all markets. Although the > Secretary determined that these Florida avocados were mature by federal > standards and fit for sale in interstate markets, the State of California > determined that they were unfit for sale by applying a test of the type > which the Secretary had determined to be unsatisfactory. We think the state > law has erected a substantial barrier to the accomplishment of congressional > objectives.373 U.S. at 166. The dissent asserted that the Secretary of Agriculture: > has promulgated a comprehensive and pervasive regulatory scheme for > determining the quality and maturity of Florida avocados, pursuant to the > statutory mandate to \\"effectuate orderly marketing of such agricultural > commodities.\\" He prescribes in minute detail the standards for the size, > appearance, shape, and maturity of avocados. Inspection procedures and, for > violation of the regulations, criminal and civil sanctions are provided. No > gap exists in the regulatory scheme which would warrant state action to > prevent the evils of a no-man's land . . . No aspects of avocado maturity > are omitted under the federal regulations. Any additional state regulation > to \\"supplement\\" federal regulation would pro tanto supplant it with another > scheme, thereby compromising to some degree the congressional policy > expressed in the Act.373 U.S. at 166-67. Both the California and Secretary's regulatory scheme have the same purpose, a purely economic one—to protect against the marketing of immature avocados, which would antagonize consumers and thus harm the industry. But the California scheme uses one test and the Secretary's scheme uses another. The result is to interfere with national marketing of agricultural products, contrary to the stated purposes of the AAA: > It is declared that the disruption of the orderly exchange of commodities in > interstate commerce . . . destroys the value of agricultural assets which > support the national credit structure . . . and burden[s] and obstruct[s] . > . . commerce. > > It is declared to be the policy of Congress . . . to establish and maintain > such minimum standards of quality and maturity and such grading and > inspection requirements for agricultural commodities . . . as will > effectuate . . . orderly marketing. . . .373 U.S. at 170 (quoting 7 U.S.C. > §§ 601, 602). It may be, as the majority suggests, White went on, that \\"local conditions of soil, climate, and the like\\" might call for different rules at the production end of the stream of commerce, but uniformity at the market end of the flow of commerce can be necessary to prevent burdens on commerce in agricultural produce: > It may not obstruct or burden commerce to admit avocados into commerce on > diverse bases in different parts of the country; any individual grower in > that situation would face but one standard. But it does burden commerce and > frustrate the congressional purpose when each grower faces different > standards in different markets. To slip from permissible nonuniformity at > one end of the stream of commerce to permissible nonuniformity at the other > end thus is to read the statute too casually and gloss over the > congressional purpose, which expressly was to facilitate marketing in and > transportation to \\"any and all markets in the current of interstate > commerce.\\"373 U.S. at 170-71. The dissent saw a clear case of conflict between the state and federal regulatory schemes: > The conflict between federal and state law is unmistakable here. The > Secretary asserts certain Florida avocados are mature. The state law rejects > them as immature. And the conflict is over a matter of central importance to > the federal scheme. The elaborate regulatory scheme of the marketing order > is focused upon the problem of moving mature avocados into interstate > commerce.373 U.S. at 173. Because the Secretary of Agriculture adopted one avocado maturity test and California adopted a different one, the state test must give way to the federal one. It is not this Court's duty to decide which test is better. \\"Neither California nor this Court has any place second-guessing the wisdom of Congress or its delegate,\\" the Secretary of Agriculture. The majority \\"ignores the plain words of the statute in concluding that the California law does not frustrate the federal scheme.\\"373 U.S. at 175. The dissent concluded: > The conclusion is inescapable that the California law is an obstacle to the > accomplishment and execution of the congressional purposes and objectives, > and that the California law and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as > supplemented by the regulations promulgated thereunder, cannot be > reconciled, and cannot consistently stand together. The Court should not > allow avocados certified as mature under the federal marketing order to be > embargoed by any State because it thinks that they are immature.373 U.S. at > 177-78. Subsequent developments After the remand, and a decade later, a three- judge federal district court decided J.R. Brooks & Son, Inc. v. Reagan.J.R. Brooks & Son, Inc. v. Reagan, No. C-71-1311 SC, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15732 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 18, 1973). Brooks is a Florida agricultural firm that claims to be \\"the premier grower, packer and shipper of tropical produce grown in Florida\\" and \\"the largest grower of Florida avocados.\\" Brooks Tropicals - company profile. Reagan was now the principal defendant because he was state governor. The court found that \\"the California 8 percent oil content requirement has been maintained and applied against Florida-grown avocados, as the result of pressure from the California avocado industry, for the purpose . . . of excluding competition from Florida avocados in California markets,\\" and the statute has been \\"maintained and applied to operate, and in fact has operated, as an embargo against Florida-grown avocados\\" with the effect that it \\"has caused higher avocado prices to California consumers by preventing the sale of competitive Florida fruit.\\"J.R. Brooks & Son, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15732, at *8. The court also found that the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture's regulations governing Florida avocado maturity \\"effectively keep [...] immature Florida avocados out of the channels of commerce.\\" Moreover, these regulations \\"provide a better index of maturity than does an 8 percent oil content requirement.\\"J.R. Brooks & Son, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15732, at *11. \\"Absent the 8 percent oil content requirement, Florida shippers of avocados would market substantial quantities of West Indian varieties of avocados in California,\\" but even though they are in fact mature they will not pass the California 8 percent test.J.R. Brooks & Son, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15732, at *14. The effect is that the California statute \\"as applied to Florida avocados, discriminates in favor of California avocado growers and shippers and against Florida avocado growers and shippers\\" and \\"arbitrarily and unreasonably burdens interstate commerce in Florida avocados by imposing a standard which is irrational as applied to Florida avocados.\\"J.R. Brooks & Son, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15732, at *19. The court accordingly concluded: > Were it not for the United States Supreme Court decision in Florida Avocado > Growers v. Paul, we would conclude that: the application of [the relevant > section of the] California Agricultural Code . . . to Florida avocados > previously certified as mature under the Federal Marketing Order, violates > the Supremacy Clause. The application of the California statute to Florida > avocados discriminates against Florida avocados and unreasonably burdens > interstate marketing of Florida avocados in violation of the Commerce > Clause.J.R. Brooks & Son, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15732, at *21. The court therefore held that California could no longer enforce its law requiring 8 percent oil content \\"with respect to avocados grown in Florida and shipped to California in interstate commerce.\\"Id. Commentary =O'Neil= Robert M. O'Neil, who had been Justice Brennan's law clerk at the time of the Avocado decision, analyzed the case in a 1975 article.Robert M. O'Neil, State Consumer Protection in a Federal System, [1975] L.J. 715. O'Neil asserted: > Federal regulation of one end of a stream of commerce did not inherently > require the states to keep their hands off the other end. The Court did not > distinguish between protecting consumers against wasting money on immature > produce and protecting health or safety. In fact, the Court seems to have > deliberately declined a clear invitation to establish a hierarchy of state > regulatory interests. Thus, by implication, preventing deception is as > constitutionally valid a purpose as preventing disease in event of a > federal-state conflict.Id. at 720. O'Neil compared the Avocado case with the Head case. decided during the same term of Court, in which Justice Brennan had concurred separately. In that case, a radio station challenged a New Mexico law forbidding the advertising of eyeglass prices, arguing that the law was in unconstitutional conflict with the regulatory authority of the Federal Communications Commission. The majority held that Congress could not have intended its grant of authority to the FCC to supplant all the detailed state regulation of professional advertising practices. According to O'Neil, \\"Justice Brennan, who wrote the majority opinion in the Avocado case, offered a . . . different view\\" in a separate concurring opinion. He disagreed that the FCC regulatory scheme did not address advertising practices. \\"Thus, preemption could not be avoided because of any lack of federal authority in the field.\\" Rather, it was avoided by the teachings of the Avocado case. These were: * The field of retail advertising, was not one that required exclusive federal superintendence, because a broadcaster could comply with both federal and state law. * There was no clear evidence of federal intent to preempt the field; FCC regulation of broadcasting was confined to certain specific facets of licensee conduct, with the implication that other facets should remain open to state regulation. * Finally, the operation of the state law did not threaten the federal superintendence of the field. It was a general law forbidding certain advertising in all media, not just radio. \\"Such legislation, whether concerned with the health and safety of consumers, or with their protection against fraud and deception, embodies a traditional state interest of the sort which our decisions have consistently respected.\\"O'Neil, at 722. O'Neil concluded that of the few preemption cases since 1963: > None of these has shed more light on consumer protection issues than the > Avocado and Head cases. Meanwhile, lower federal and state courts, faced > with regulatory conflicts in the consumer area, have looked to Avocado for > guidance.Id. =Deutsch= Jan Deutsch, who had been the law clerk of Justice Potter Stewart at the time of the Avocado and Head decisions, wrote at length about the Avocado case.Jan G. Deutsch, Precedent and Adjudication, 83 L.J. 1553 (1974), Deutsch emphasized the difference between the majority's and dissent's respective views of the contexts of the two regulatory schemes, and in particular the legitimacy of each scheme. The majority opinion insists, \\"[T]he present record permits no inference that the California statute had a discriminatory objective.\\"See 373 U.S. at 153. At the same time, the majority questioned the legitimacy of the AAA marketing order scheme because: > [T]he Florida avocado maturity standards are drafted each year not by > impartial experts in Washington or even in Florida, but rather by the South > Florida Avocado Administrative Committee, which consists entirely of > representatives of the growers and handlers concerned. It appears that the > Secretary of Agriculture has invariably adopted the Committee's > recommendations for maturity dates, sizes, and weights. Thus the pattern > which emerges is one of maturity regulations drafted and administered > locally by the growers' own representatives, and designed to do no more than > promote orderly competition among the South Florida growers.373 U.S. at > 150-51. On the other hand, the dissent defends the legitimacy of the AAA scheme: > It is suggested that the regulations involved here are \\"simply schemes for > regulating competition among growers . . . initiated and administered by the > growers and shippers themselves.\\" From this proposition, it is in some way > reasoned that \\"the self-help standards of this marketing program\\" should not > be deemed to preclude application of state law which conflicts with and > interferes with the operation of the comprehensive federal marketing > program. The \\"simply\\" part of the proposition overlooks, however, the fact > that these are the Secretary's regulations, promulgated under congressional > authority. It also overlooks the Secretary's extensive supervisory powers, > and his statutory duty under 7 U.S.C. § 602(3) to insure that regulations be > carried on \\"in the public interest.\\" And no case has been cited to us which > indicates that the delegation to the regulatees of the power to propose > regulations in the first instance violates any provision of general law.373 > U.S. at 177 n.20. The state legislature rubber-stamping the demands of the California avocado industry and the Secretary of Agriculture rubber-stamping the proposals of the Florida avocado industry thus appear to present a pot and kettle in a relative blackness contest. Deutsch concludes by asking a question that was never answered: given the findings of the 1973 remand decision in Brooks v. Reagan about blatant state protectionism for its domestic avocado industry and that the California 8% oil law \\"arbitrarily and unreasonably burdens interstate commerce in Florida avocados by imposing a standard which is irrational as applied to Florida avocados,\\" what could the Court say on the appeal of the Brooks case to justify its 1963 decision?The question was never answered because there was no appeal to the Supreme Court. =WSJ 2016= A June 2016 article in the Wall Street Journal describes the current state of the Avocado War between Florida and California.Erin Ailworth, Lowly Guacamole! Florida's 'SlimCado' Lands With a Thud, (June 3, 2016). J.R. Brooks (now Brooks Tropicals LLC), the successful plaintiff in the remand after the Supreme Court opinion, established the trademark \\"SlimCados\\" to designate several different Florida avocado varieties that it markets. Brooks promotes the lower fat content of Florida avocados as a desirable diet feature in \\"trying to compete with California's Hass variety, which accounts for 95% of the American avocado market and 80% of global demand.\\" However, according to the Journal, \\"the oversize SlimCados look like a guacamole lover's dream,\\" because their weight is up to six times that of a Hass, but \\"their different taste has left many disappointed, making them the avocado some foodies love to hate.\\" The Journal quotes one detractor of Florida avocados as complaining, \\"I've never felt so betrayed by a piece of food in my life,\\" because the Florida \\"avocado's innards were watery, producing a soupy guacamole that lacked the rich, creamy flavor she craved.\\" References Further reading *Robert M.

In the comics, Deacon Frost was depicted as a tall, white-haired, late middle-aged gentleman with red eyes, and wearing 1860s Germany period clothing. His doppelgänger sported an accent and attire that suggested a Southern preacher. The character appeared in the 1998 film Blade, portrayed by Stephen Dorff. Publication history Deacon Frost first appeared in The Tomb of Dracula #13 (October 1973), and was created by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan. Fictional character biography Deacon Frost was allegedly a scientist looking for the key to immortality. For one of his experiments, he kidnapped a young woman in order to inject his victim with the blood of a recently killed vampire. The girl's fiancé broke into the lab, and (in the resulting scuffle) Frost was accidentally injected with the blood himself. The result was that Frost became a vampire but (due to the unusual method of becoming one) he was endowed with a unique characteristic; anyone he turned into a vampire would generate a doppelgänger. He could create an unlimited number of doppelgängers by biting each doppelgänger, and they would all be under his mental control. Frost intended to use this ability to contend for the position of Lord of Vampires, a position that was presently held by Dracula. Frost is the vampire responsible for the death of Blade's mother; Blade's initial mission is to exact revenge against her killer. It was also Frost who turned Hannibal King into a vampire. Blade and King (while initially distrusting each other) eventually teamed up to fight Frost's army of doppelgangers of Blade and King. The two of them managed to defeat and apparently destroy Frost in his underground hideout, stabbing him twice and leaving his body to be consumed as his hideout exploded. Many years later, Blade encountered a vampire that called itself Deacon Frost. This vampire had a different appearance and personality to the original, and was later identified as being a doppelgänger. The doppelgänger attempted to summon a powerful demon, only to be devoured by said creature. In a later one-shot story set in New Orleans, Frost was encountered yet again, but he appeared as he did in The Tomb of Dracula. He also confirmed that the previous encounter was indeed an imposter (as Blade suspected) who was created using science and magic. Blade and King, with the help of Brother Voodoo, foiled Frost's attempt to gain control of Garwood Industries through Donna Garth (daughter of Simon Garth the Living Zombie). Frost escaped this encounter vowing revenge. More recently, Frost appeared at the summons of Dracula to defend the Lord of Vampires as he underwent a magical ritual, only to be staked by Blade. Other versions = Earth-9991 = While roughhousing, two boys enter the parking garage where Frost is located with his latest creation, a monster called the White Worm. Frost sics the White Worm on the children, then flees when he senses the approach of Blade. =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate version of Deacon Frost appears with a youthful appearance. He has been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to convince Blade to join Nick Fury's Black ops team.Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates #2 In other media =Television= * Deacon Frost appears in Marvel Anime: Blade, voiced by Tsutomu Isobe in the Japanese version and by JB Blanc in the English Dub. This version is the leader of an organization he created called Existence (the symbol of the organization being a bat with DNA threads), whose membership comprises hordes of vampires, most of which have been genetically altered by his science to make them more powerful, and humans who have been deceived into helping them in exchange for fulfilling their own desires. Frost is known as the four-fanged vampire and famed as powerful even by vampire standards. With his organization greatly spreading its influence in Asia, this puts him in conflict with the council of pure-blood vampires who have ruled Europe for many centuries. While responsible for many tragedies surrounding Blade and others, Frost suffered his own tragic event while human. Having witnessed his son Edgar killed by a vampire and further infuriated by corrupt police that were not looking into the case, Frost decided to research vampires with the help of many vampire hunters he hired with the purpose of turning himself into a stronger breed of vampire. This ultimately motivates Frost's goal to wipe out the old vampire race, then rule the world with a race of genetically altered vampires created from Blade's own Daywalker blood. Deacon Frost has done experiments on the Mandurugo, the Manananggal, and the Sundel bolong. By the end of the series, Frost drinks the blood in his daywalking vampires to assume a stronger form, but is slain moments after in a final showdown with Blade, using his mother's and Makoto's silver weapons. =Film= Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost / La Magra in the 1998 film Blade. * Deacon Frost appeared as the main antagonist of the 1998 film Blade, portrayed by Stephen Dorff. This depiction was a younger and more updated version for the 1990s while retaining his upstart ambitions. His main objective was to become the vampire God La Magra and rid the world of humans, believing the planet belongs to the vampire race. After killing the House of Erebus' leaders as part of the ritual, Blade and Karen Jenson spoiled Frost's plans. Despite their efforts however, Frost managed to complete the ritual and be one with La Magra, engaging Blade in a sword battle. During the fight, Blade managed to gain the upper hand, cutting off Frost's right arm and then proceeded to cut him in half, only for Frost's top half to re-connect and regrow his right arm. But after a stand-off, Frost was finally killed by Blade's use of EDTA darts which caused him to explode. * In October 2008, Blade director Stephen Norrington was confirmed to be developing on a prequel trilogy to Blade, featuring Stephen Dorff reprising his role as Deacon Frost. However, in 2012 the rights for Blade returned to Marvel Studios. =Video games= Deacon Frost appears as the main antagonist on the Blade table in Marvel Pinball.

This can help to reduce the recoil induced in the body of the firearm so long as the subsequent motion of the breechblock is retarded in some manner - either by a spring, or by back- pressure against a piston attached to the breechblock provided by tapping the expelled propellant gases. The motion of the breech and/or the expansion of the expelled gases can also be used to power a case-ejection mechanism and/or reloading mechanism. If the ammunition is caseless, the time required to expel the previous case is removed from the cycle time of an automatic firearm and a higher rate of fire can be obtained than with normal ammunition. The Heckler & Koch G11 Assault rifle uses caseless ammunition, but has a rotating breech, not a floating breech. However, the barrel, breech and magazine as a whole 'float' within the housing of the weapon.

Over time, the optical density, color balance, lustre, and other qualities of a print will degrade. The rate at which deterioration occurs depends primarily on two main factors: the print itself, that is, the colorants used to form the image and the medium on which image resides, and the type of environment the print is exposed to. Inkjet prints For inkjet prints, pigment-based inks last generally longest when used with specific paper types, whereas dye-based inks can be optimal on more types of paper. Ink-jet paper types include swellable paper, porous paper, and cotton rag paper. Chromogenic color prints (silver halide prints) The longevity of images on chromogenic color photographic papers depends on the temperature and relative humidity of the storage environment, and on the total light exposure they receive. Older chromogenic papers undergo more rapid fading compared to modern materials. For example, Fujifilm's Crystal Archive papers have a quoted longevity of sixty years dark storage. The stability of coupler-incorporated chromogenic prints has steadily increased since their introduction by Kodak in 1942. Very significant advances in stability were made in case of Kodak prints in 1954, 1958, and in the early 1980s. These changes can often be used for the dating of color prints, and can be correlated with manufacturing changes documented in the technical literature. Monochrome prints In general, black-and-white prints using either silver or carbon-based media may last longer than some colour prints. Some black-and- white prints are produced using ink-jet printers, or colour photographic paper using the RA 4 process. =Gelatin silver prints= To achieve a long lifespan, gelatin silver prints must be thoroughly fixed and washed. Besides rendering the image insensitive to further light exposure, fixer converts undeveloped silver salts in the emulsion into products that can easily be washed away. Effective fixing and washing removes all unexposed silver salts and leaves only a small amount of residual fixer. Any significant quantity of fixer (thiosulphate) left in the print after washing will cause the image to deteriorate over time. Many other factors play a critical role in the long- term stability of gelatin silver prints. The temperature and relative humidity of the storage environment, and the air pollutants to which a silver image is exposed are three of the most important factors. Toning can increase the longevity of silver-based prints by replacing or coating the metallic silver with more inert metals such as gold, silver sulphide or selenium.  Silverprint article on print longevity  Accessed 5 September 2008 =Platinum, palladium and other inert metals= Images composed of more inert metals, like platinum, palladium and gold are less prone to decay than those in silver. Amateur Photographer's Dictionary of Photography said \\"Owing to the chemically inert nature of platinum, a print so made is far more permanent than any print having a silver image can be\\". Indeed, the Victoria and Albert Museum's Conservation Journal states that \\"...the majority of the deterioration seen in such prints is usually associated with the supports, which are often yellowed and brittle, rather than the actual image.\\" Environmental factors Environmental factors that hasten the deterioration of a print include exposure to heat, ozone and other pollutants, water or humidity, and high levels of light. Though light-induced fade often gets the most publicity, greater than 90 per cent of consumer prints are stored in the dark where the effects of heat, humidity, and/or pollutants can dominate. Research and standards Much research into image permanence has been carried out by Wilhelm Imaging Research, Inc.http://www.wilhelm- research.com/index.html Wilhelm Imaging Research, Inc. website  Accessed 5 September 2008 Another resource is Aardenburg Imaging & Archives. Some film companies and printer manufacturers are researching ways to increase the lifetime of their prints. The International Organization for Standardization has developed standards for keeping photographs, defined in ISO 18920. Those standards have yet to be extended to digital print output, though the organization has signaled its intent to provide such standards.

The eight lotuses in the upper register represent the eight provinces of British India. The words in the middle are in Devanagri script and read Vande Mataram \\"[We] Bow to thee Mother [India]\\", the slogan of the Indian National Congress. The design was adopted in 1914 as the emblem of the Berlin Committee (later known as the Indian Independence Committee). The original \\"Flag of Indian Independence\\" raised by Cama in Stuttgart is now on display at the Maratha and Kesari Library in Pune. Bhikaiji Rustom CamaBhikhai- (with aspirated -kh-) is the name as it appears in the biographies. Another common form is Bhikai- (with unaspirated -k-), as it appears on the postage stamp. The name is also frequently misspelled 'Bhikha-' (with missing -i-), which is a male name (unlike the feminine Bhikhai-). (24 September 1861 – 13 August 1936) was one of the prominent figures in the Indian independence movement. Bhikaiji Cama was born in Bombay (now Mumbai) in a large, well-off Parsi family. Her parents, Sorabji Framji Patel and Jaijibai Sorabji Patel, were well known in the city, where her father Sorabji—a lawyer by training and a merchant by profession—was an influential member of the Parsi community. She was invited to hoist the flag over the parliament in Germany. Like many Parsi girls of the time, Bhikhaiji attended Alexandra Girls' English Institution.. Bhikhaiji was by all accounts a diligent, disciplined child with a flair for languages. On 3 August 1885, she married Rustom Cama, who was the son of K. R. Cama. Her husband was a wealthy, pro-British lawyer who aspired to enter politics. It was not a happy marriage, and Bhikhaiji spent most of her time and energy in philanthropic activities and social work. Activism In October 1896, the Mumbai Presidency was hit first by famine, and shortly thereafter by bubonic plague. Bhikhaiji joined one of the many teams working out of Grant Medical College (which would subsequently become Haffkine's plague vaccine research centre), in an effort to provide care for the afflicted, and (later) to inoculate the healthy. Cama subsequently contracted the plague herself but survived. As she was severely weakened, she was sent to Britain for medical care in 1902. She was preparing to return to India in 1908 when she came in contact with Shyamji Krishna Varma, who was well known in London's Indian community for fiery nationalist speeches he gave in Hyde Park. Through him, she met Dadabhai Naoroji, then president of the British Committee of the Indian National Congress, and for whom she came to work as private secretary. Together with Naoroji and Singh Rewabhai Rana, Cama supported the founding of Varma's Indian Home Rule Society in February 1905. In London, she was told that her return to India would be prevented unless she would sign a statement promising not to participate in nationalist activities. She refused. That same year Cama relocated to Paris, where—together with S. R. Rana and Munchershah Burjorji Godrej—she co-founded the Paris Indian Society. Together with other notable members of the movement for Indian sovereignty living in exile, Cama wrote, published (in the Netherlands and Switzerland) and distributed revolutionary literature for the movement, including Bande Mataram (founded in response to the Crown ban on the poem Vande Mataram) and later Madan's Talwar (in response to the execution of Madan Lal Dhingra).. These weeklies were smuggled into India through the French colony of Pondichéry. On 22 August 1907, Cama attended the second Socialist Congress at Stuttgart, Germany, where she described the devastating effects of a famine that had struck the Indian subcontinent. In her appeal for human rights, equality and for autonomy from Great Britain, she unfurled what she called the \\"Flag of Indian Independence\\".\\"This flag is of India's independence. Behold, it is born. It is already sanctified by the blood of martyred Indian youth. I call upon you, gentlemen, to rise and salute the flag of Indian independence. In the name of this flag, I appeal to lovers of freedom all over the world to cooperate with this flag in freeing one-fifth of the human race.\\" It has been speculated that this moment may have been an inspiration to African American writer and intellectual W. E. B. Du Bois in writing his 1928 novel Dark Princess. Cama's flag, a modification of the Calcutta Flag, was co-designed by Cama, and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, and would later serve as one of the templates from which the current national flag of India was created. In 1909, following Madan Lal Dhingra's assassination of William Hutt Curzon Wyllie, an aide to the Secretary of State for India, Scotland Yard arrested several key activists living in Great Britain, among them Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. In 1910, Savarkar was ordered to be returned to India for trial. When the ship Savarkar was being transported on docked in Marseilles harbour, he squeezed out through a porthole window and jumped into the sea. Reaching shore, he expected to find Cama and others who had been told to expect him (who got there late) but ran into the local constabulary instead. Unable to communicate his predicament to the French authorities without Cama's help, he was returned to British custody. The British Government requested Cama's extradition, but the French Government refused to cooperate. In return, the British Government seized Cama's inheritance. Lenin reportedly invited her to reside in the Soviet Union, but she did not accept. Influenced by Christabel Pankhurst and the Suffragette movement, Bhikhaiji Cama was vehement in her support for gender equality. Speaking in Cairo, Egypt in 1910, she asked, \\"I see here the representatives of only half the population of Egypt. May I ask where is the other half? Sons of Egypt, where are the daughters of Egypt? Where are your mothers and sisters? Your wives and daughters?\\" Cama's stance with respect to the vote for women was, however, secondary to her position on Indian independence; in 1920, upon meeting Herabai and Mithan Tata, two Parsi women outspoken on the issue of the right to vote, Cama is said to have sadly shaken her head and observed: \\"'Work for Indian's freedom and [i]ndependence. When India is independent women will not only [have] the right to [v]ote, but all other rights.'\\". Exile and death With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, France and Britain became allies, and all the members of Paris India Society except Cama and Singh Rewabhai Rana left the country (Cama had been advised by fellow-socialist Jean Longuet to go to Spain with M.P. Tirumal Acharya and Rana were briefly arrested in October 1914 when they tried to agitate among Punjab Regiment troops that had just arrived in Marseilles on their way to the front. They were required to leave Marseilles, and Cama then moved to Rana's wife's house in Arcachon, near Bordeaux. In January 1915, the French government deported Rana and his whole family to the Caribbean island of Martinique, and Cama was sent to Vichy, where she was interned. In bad health, she was released in November 1917 and permitted to return to Bordeaux provided that she report weekly to the local police. Following the war, Cama returned to her home at 25, Rue de Ponthieu in Paris. Cama remained in exile in Europe until 1935, when, gravely ill and paralysed by a stroke that she had suffered earlier that year, she petitioned the British government through Sir Cowasji Jehangir to be allowed to return home. Writing from Paris on 24 June 1935, she acceded to the requirement that she renounce seditionist activities. Accompanied by Jehangir, she arrived in Bombay in November 1935 and died nine months later, aged , at Parsi General Hospital on 13 August 1936. Legacy Cama on a 1962 stamp of India Bikhaiji Cama bequeathed most of her personal assets to the Avabai Petit Orphanage for girls, now the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls'High School, which established a trust in her name. Rs. 54,000 (1936: £39,300; $157,200) to her family's fire temple, the Framji Nusserwanjee Patel Agiary at Mazgaon, in South Bombay.. Several Indian cities have streets and places named after Bhikhaiji Cama, or Madame Cama as she is also known. On 26 January 1962, India's 11th Republic Day, the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department issued a commemorative stamp in her honour. In 1997, the Indian Coast Guard commissioned a Priyadarshini-class fast patrol vessel ICGS Bikhaiji Cama after Bikhaiji Cama. The high rise office complex in the posh location of South Delhi which accommodates big shot companies such as Jindal Group, SAIL, GAIL, EIL etc. are also named as Bhikaji Cama Place. This is a tribute to her. Following Cama's 1907 Stuttgart address, the flag she raised there was smuggled into British India by Indulal Yagnik and is now on display at the Maratha and Kesari Library in Pune. In 2004, politicians of the BJP, India's political party, attempted to identify a later design (from the 1920s) as the flag Cama raised in Stuttgart.. The flag Cama raised – misrepresented as \\"original national Tricolour\\" – has an (Islamic) crescent and a (Hindu) sun, which the later design does not have. Further reading . * .

Description A simple unadorned example from St Marys Church, Grendon, Northants The Easter Sepulchre is an arched recess generally in the north wall of the chancel, in which from Good Friday to Easter day were deposited the crucifix and sacred elements in commemoration of Christ's entombment and resurrection. It was generally only a wooden structure, which was placed in a recess or on a tomb. Distribution The Easter Sepulchre is only found in England and Wales, the practice having been peculiar to the Sarum Rite. However, there is a ruin presumed to be an Easter sepulchre at Kildrummy in north-east Scotland. Use Easter Sepulchre, Holcombe Burnell Church, Devon. Detail of central sculpted relief showing Christ stepping out of the tomb with sleeping guards The Easter Sepulchre contained the Blessed Sacrament of the altar, the Host. Following the doctrine of the Real Presence, i.e. that Jesus is physically present within in the Host, on Good Friday the Host was taken from the tabernacle where it had been placed following the Maundy Thursday celebration of the Last Supper and, wrapped in linen cloths, 'buried' in the Easter sepulchre which was found on the north wall of the sanctuary. Cut into the wall, it was sometimes ornately carved but within it was a wooden frame on which was hung a cloth pall often embroidered with scenes from the Passion. Candles were lit around the sepulchre, burial clothes adorned it, and parishioners stood guard until early Easter morning at the first Mass. The Host was brought out, in imitation of Jesus having arisen out of the tomb, and was placed again in the tabernacle in the centre of the Church. Like Roods and their lofts, Easter Sepulchres were the object of iconoclastic fury by the Reformers and few are left.

The Indian Home Rule movement was a movement in British India on the lines of Irish Home Rule movement and other home rule movements. The movement lasted around two years between 1916–1918 and is believed to have set the stage for the independence movement under the leadership of Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak to the educated English speaking upper class Indians. In 1921 All India Home Rule League changed its name to Swarajya Sabha.  Flag  Home Rule flag Five red and four green horizontal stripes. On the upper left quadrant was the Union Flag, which signified the Dominion status that the movement sought to achieve. A crescent and a seven-pointed star, both in white, are set in top fly. Seven white stars are arranged as in the Saptarishi constellation (the constellation Ursa Major), which is sacred to Hindus.  Background  Indian home rule movement began in India in the background of World War I. The Government of India Act (1909) failed to satisfy the demands of the national leaders. However, the split in the congress and the absence of leaders like Tilak, who was imprisoned in Mandalay meant that nationalistic response was tepid. By 1915, many factors set the stage for a new phase of nationalist movement. The rise in stature of Annie Besant (who was of part Irish origin and a firm supporter of Irish Home Rule Movement), the return of Tilak from exile and the growing calls for solving the split in congress began to stir the political scene in India. The Ghadar Mutiny and its suppression led to an atmosphere of resentment against British rule. In context of World War I Most Indians and Indian political leaders had been divided in their response to World War I and the Indian soldiers fighting on behalf of the British Empire against Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The latter's involvement irked India's Muslims, who saw the Sultan as the Caliph of Islam. Many Indian revolutionaries opposed the war, while moderates and liberals backed the war. The issue divided India's political classes and left the increasing demand for self-government going nowhere. Besant however declared, \\"England's need is India's opportunity\\". As editor of the New India newspaper, she attacked the colonial government of India and called for clear and decisive moves towards self-rule. As with Ireland, the government refused to discuss any changes while the war lasted. This set the stage for the movement.  Foundation  Between 1916 and 1918, when the war was beginning, prominent Indians like Joseph Baptista, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, G. S. Khaparde, Sir S. Subramania Iyer ,Satendra Nath Bose And the leader of the Theosophical Society, Annie Besant, decided to organise a national alliance of leagues across India, specifically to demand Home Rule, or self-government within the British Empire for all of India. Tilak founded the first home rule league at the Bombay provincial congress at Belgaum in April,1916.India's struggle for Independence, Bipan Chandra, p161 then after this Annie Besant founded second league at Adyar Madras in September 1916. While Tilak's league worked in areas like Maharashtra (excluding Bombay city), Karnataka, Central provinces and Berar, Annie Besant's league worked in the rest of India.The members of Servants of India Society were not allowed to join the movement. The move created considerable excitement at the time, and attracted many members of the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League, who had been allied since the 1916 Lucknow Pact. The leaders of the League gave fiery speeches, and petitions with hundreds of thousands of Indians as signatories were submitted to British authorities. Unification of moderates and radicals as well as unity between Muslim League and Indian National Congress was a remarkable achievement of Annie Besant. The government arrested Annie Besant in 1917 and this led to nationwide protests. The movement actually spread out and made its impact in the interior villages of India. Many moderate leaders like Muhammad Ali Jinnah joined the movement. The League spread political awareness in new areas like Sindh, Punjab, Gujarat, United Provinces, Central provinces, Bihar, Orissa and Madras, which all sought an active political movement. The pressure of the movement, especially after Annie Besant's arrest, led to the Montague's declaration on 20 August 1917 which stated that \\"progressive realization of responsible government in India\\" was the policy of the British government.India's struggle for Independence, Bipan Chandra, p168 During this time various meetings were held in Nellore, Kurnool, Bellary, Cuddapah, Kakinada, Rajahmundry and Vizagapatnam. In Kurnool a prominent leader, Raja Sir P. V. Madhava Rao of Panyam has supported the home rule league. The speech given by him in a meeting held in kurnool is highlighted here in which he thrashed the British Government saying the (bulk of) bureaucracy has failed to understand the needs of the people and the requirements of time. Later after the completion of meeting's in Madras Presidency many prominent leaders gave support to the league under the leadership of Annie Besant.  Decline  Hind Swaraj\\" - \\"Indian Home Rule\\" in translation. The copyright legend on this first edition bears these words: \\"No Rights Reserved\\". The Movement was also left leaderless once Tilak left for England to pursue a libel case he had filed against Valentine Chirol and Annie Besant was largely satisfied by the promise of Reforms. Its further growth and activity were stalled by the rise of Mahatma Gandhi and his Satyagraha art of revolution: non-violent, but mass- based civil disobedience. Gandhi's Hindu lifestyle, mannerisms and immense respect for Indian culture and the common people of India made him immensely popular with India's common people. His victories in leading the farmers of Champaran, Bihar and Kheda, Gujarat against the British authorities on tax revolts made him a national hero. After the Montagu Declaration, also known as the August Declaration, the league agreed to suspend its expansion of the movement. After this the moderate candidates gave up the membership of league. The league believed that the British government will gradually reform the administration and local representative system by ushering participation of local Indians.  Dissolution  In 1920, the All India Home Rule League merged with Congress which elected Mahatma Gandhi as its president. Several leaders of Home Rule Movement played an important role in the national movement when it entered a truly mass movement phase under the leadership of Gandhi.

It lies south of the province capital, in the lower territory called \\"Bassa Bergamasca\\". It's also part of the geographic area named \\"Gera d'Adda\\", included among the rivers Fosso Bergamasco to the North, Adda to the West and Serio to the East. With approximately 30,000 inhabitants, the comune is now the second most populous town in the province. It is rarely called \\"The tractor town\\" for the presence of the SAME Deutz-Fahr headquarters or seldom \\"The town of courtyards\\" for their preponderant presence in the Old Town. It is subdivided in five main quartiers: Old town, West zone, North zone, the recent built East zone and the PIP (Industrial Zone). Northward lie four frazioni (subdivisions): Geromina, Castel Cerreto, Battaglie and Cascina Pezzoli; once the village of Castel Rozzone was also a frazione of Treviglio. The coat of arms is composed of a crenellated tower, which represents the city with its Ghibelline past; flanked by two golden lions rampant, for its free and valiant citizenry and topped by an eagle, symbol of the privileges obtained by the Holy Roman Empire, which is holding a pig aloft, symbol of the achieved prosperity. History The area where Treviglio lies was firstly inhabited by Celtic tribes, in particular Insubres. During the conquest of the Cisalpine Gaul (Gallia Cisalpina) by the Romans a castrum was built to guard an important trading crossway and the near villages. Afterward a Roman settlement was founded and grew through trade and local goods manufacture. After the arrival of the Lombards the territory was included in the Fara Gera d'Adda (Fara which was an administrative division of the Lombard system) and, after the fall of the Kingdom of the Lombards it became part of the Holy Roman Empire. Treviglio was founded in the Early Middle Ages as a fortified town, unifying three preexisting settlements: Cusarola (Celtic), Pisignano (Roman) and Portoli (Lombard). Thus the original town was divided into three districts, called 'portae' (Latin for \\"gates\\"), each headed toward one of the settlements: \\"Porta Torre\\" to the village of Cusarola; \\"Porta Zeduro\\" (named originally \\"Zelute\\") to Portoli and \\"Porta Filagno\\" to that of Pisignano. The first official document found citing the new town dates back to November 964 D.C. Around the year 1000 Treviglio harbored the inhabitants of Oriano, a commune near Brescia, which had been destroyed in the course of the struggle between Arduin of Ivrea and Henry II who were warring for the Imperial crown. During the wars that had taken place in Northern Italy the city of Treviglio grew harboring refugees in the new fourth district of \\"Porta Nova\\", originally called \\" Porta Oriano\\". The Rozzoni family, at that time powerful, tried in vain a coup d'état, and was as a consequence temporarily exiled in its property near Treviglio, \\"Castel Rozzone\\" (in Italian \\"Rozzoni's Castle\\") that nowadays is a village independent from the city itself. In 1167 Treviglio joined the first Lombard League, which had the aim of preserving local jurisdiction and droit de régale, a purpose that was achieved with the victory over emperor Frederick I 'Barbarossa', at the Battle of Legnano. Treviglio sent soldiers to help the League winning the decisive battle.↵The Statute, a copy of which dated 1392 is currently housed in the city's museum, describes a government held by sixty Consuls- initially twenty each for everyone of the original ethnic communities, thereafter fifteen for each district - these remaining in office for six months. The leading member of the Council and chief of Treviglio was the Chancellor (Cancelliere), similar to an actual mayor. This statute also required that no noble could be allowed to live within the city walls - and therefore to be elected Consul - so as to prevent their possible involvements in the power strifes of the town and the town involvement in their struggles for power. In 1395 Treviglio gained formal autonomy from the Empire, which it held as a \\"Separate Land of the Duchy of Milan\\", excepting several brief Venetian occupations (1431-1433; 1448–1453 and 1499–1509). These occupations are mentioned in The Betrothed, a renowned Italian novel by Alessandro Manzoni. At the last withdrawal in 1509, the city was burnt down by the departing Venetian troops. The French king Louis XII who witnessed the event, claimed to vindicate it in the subsequent Battle of Agnadello. On 28 February 1522 General Odet de Foix Viscount of Lautrec, leading the French army through Northern Italy on its way to the South, came to punish the town for the insolence shown by denying supplies to the French troops and resisting them. The chronicles tell of the general refusing the surrender of the city and the appeals of mercy of the parish priest and of the Duke of Milan himself; therefore - so the story - the inhabitants took refuge in the churches and, when the French troops entered the town, a fresco of Our Lady in front of which the inhabitants were praying, appeared to weep. Warned of this portentous event, the General did check the building and its walls to verify the veracity of the miracle and, finally persuaded, deposed helmet and sword at the feet of the fresco and left the city. Helmet and sword are still preserved in the Sanctuary, built with donations of the Treviglio's families only, and in which was transferred the miraculous fresco over which were added, crowns forged with the jewels of the virgins of Treviglio. This episode is celebrated every year with a re-enactment, an historical parade and a novena (nine days of prayers). A popular song about the event is still famous in the town. After many long years of war, the French sold Treviglio to the Spaniards, albeit the town was formally still under the aegis of the Holy Roman Empire. During this last domination the town as well as the whole region, knew an initial period of prosperity followed by a gradual decline, aggravated in the 17th century by an epidemic of plague. The Spanish period ended transforming Treviglio in fief and auctioning it off to meet the debts of the Duchy [ of Milan ], but the town people fiercely opposed the measure and, after losing a lawsuit against the Senate of Milan, self-taxed themselves to reclaim the fief and its independence. After the French Revolution in 1796, Treviglio became part of the Transpadane Republic, the following year of the Cisalpine Republic and, in 1805, of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. It was during these years that many of the religious buildings were looted and a detailed official map of the town was drawn. The local dialect - like almost everywhere in Lombardy - preserves words and sounds, reminiscent of the frequent French occupations After the Congress of Vienna the town was included in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, then temporarily attached to the Kingdom of Sardinia during the first Italian War of Independence and, finally, the town joined the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. On 17 December 1915 Benito Mussolini married in civil union Rachele Guidi in Treviglio, after the future Duce had recovered in the local hospital. With a Presidential Decree of January 8, 1960, Treviglio was declared a City, as promised by King Victor Emanuel II in 1860, due to its historical involvement in the achievement of the Italian Independence. Survived family names dating back to Treviglio are Bornaghi, Facchetti, Butinone (and variants), Carioli, Gatti (and variants), Manenti and Rozzoni. Others, like Aresi, Cortesi, Conti, Colombo, Merisi and Monzio Compagnoni; are very widespread, but originate from neighboring villages or others places. For instance, Merisi is from Caravaggio and Aresi from Brignano Gera d'Adda. Main sights * Palazzo Municipale (Town Hall), finished in 1300. It was restored in 1582 and received another floor in 1873. It has an elegant portico. * Basilica of San Martino, built in 1008 over the pre- Romanesque church of the Assunta. In 1482 it was remade in Lombard-Gothic style. The current façade, in the Baroque style, is from 1740. The interior has works by Gian Paolo Cavagna, Camillo Procaccini and other, but its most notable feature is the polyptych of Madonna with Saints by Bernardo Zenale and Bernardino Butinone (1485), considered one of the masterworks of 15th century Lombard art. The bell tower (a former civic tower) dates to the early 11th century. The bell tower is open and accessible every weekend. * Sanctuary of Madonna delle Lacrime (1619). Named after Our Lady of Tears who saved, with her prodigious tears, the city from destruction by the French troops, led by General Odet de Foix, on 28 February 1522. It has been restored in 2019–2020. * Silva Palace * Galliari Palace * Gothic House * Semenza House * Baccherra House * House of the square * Bar Milano, sited in Manara's square, is the city's historical cafe. Founded in 1896, still it retains the original furniture of the century and a counter in Art Nouveau style. It's told that Thomas Mann once visited it on his way to meet his brother in Palestrina. * Church of San Carlo (17th century). * Relief of the Gatta (\\"Kitty\\") in Manara's square, is a trophy of the medieval feud between Treviglio and the near town of Caravaggio, now remembered only by the annual bowling tournament. * TNT (\\"Teatro Nuovo Treviglio\\", Italian for \\"New Theater of Treviglio\\") in Garibaldi's square. * The Filodrammatici (Old Theater). * Ariston Multisala Cinema The old city is composed primarily by courtyards tenements, most of them open to the public twice a year. Many are also the sacred shrines, real places of worship boasting ancient traditions. On festive occasions the bell tower and the town squares are decorated with projections of images and animations. Economy Agriculture and trade were prominent in the economy of Treviglio from its beginning to today and, until the 20th century, there was a flourishing craft sector producing furniture and silk; then the swift industrial development and the relocation of that production made way to the mechanical (in particular the SDF, Bianchi bicycles), electrical and chemical industries which are still active. The flow of the necessary capital for the establishment of new local enterprises, promoted the growth of the local bank, BCC (Credit Union) and of insurances agencies. During the economic crisis many local enterprises were forced to close or were acquired by larger companies and their production transferred to Eastern Europe or Asia. The local bank undertook an expansion effort that weakened it and the local government focused on the development of services, tourism and trade. The town attracts people from the surrounding villages with its services, while the Old Town boasts artisan food shops, cafes and fashion shops which are very appreciated.  Culture and education  Treviglio has a central library, located in an adapted cloister, and four peripheral ones with more than 75,000 items, of which 10,000 are antique books, the library system is integrated in the Sistema Bibliotecario Integrato della Bassa Pianura Bergamasca (in English: Integrated Library System of the Lower Bergamo Plain) that group in its management thirty-one municipalities; from 2010 there is also available a free media library. The town hosts two historical museum, two picture gallery, one scientific museum and two tiny natural protected areas. All cultural activities are led by several historical and scientific associations. There are two local newspapers, Il popolo cattolico (Catholic people) and Il Giornale di Treviglio (Treviglio's Journal). There are at least three linguistic centers; seven kindergartens (both public and private); ten elementary schools (both public and private); four junior high schools (both public and private) and thirteen senior high schools (both public and private), including lyceums and technical schools, offering 23 different courses of study.  Sport  Treviglio has a public sport center and a public pool; a tennis center, several fields for soccer, basketball and volleyball and gyms (both public and private). The town is represented in many disciplines, among those football, basketball, volleyball, athletics and rugby; with remarkable achievements in the regional context and beyond. There are also schools of mountain climbing, cycling, BMX, motorcycle, equitation, diving, water polo, swimming, pilates, martial arts, artistic gymnastics and modern and classic dance. = Football Teams = * G.S.D.

Today the town has two railway stations. The Treviglio Central Station (known as Treviglio Centrale) is on the Milan–Venice line, the Treviglio-Cremona and the Treviglio–Bergamo line; on this last lies also the West Station. From 2009, the Central Station is also terminus for the lines S5 and S6 of the suburban train service of Milan. The city can be reached by car with State Roads N.11 (Milano-Brescia) and N.42 (from Bergamo, to Lodi and Crema); directly with the highway A35 (called BreBeMi, initials of the main cities connected through it: Brescia, Bergamo and Milan) and also the Provincial Roads 128, 129, 136, 141, 142 and State Road 472 which links Treviglio with the city of Lodi.

The taxonomy is highly complex and it often includes C. canivetii, C. auriceps, C. forficatus, C. assimilis, C. gibsoni and C. melanorhynchus from north-western South America and Central America as subspecies. It is a bird of savanna, scrub, cultivation and similar semi-open woodland. In the Amazon, where generally uncommon and more localized than in the northern part of its range, it mainly occurs at forest edge and in várzea. The female lays her eggs in a small cup nest, similar to that of the ruby-topaz hummingbird, placed on a horizontal tree branch. Incubation is 13 days with a further 18 days to fledging. The blue-tailed emerald is 7.5 cm (3 in) long and weighs 2.6 g. The black bill is relatively short and straight. The male has a brilliant green plumage, with white thighs and a dark metallic blue tail (clearly forked in the northern part of its range; slightly so in the central and southern part). The female average smaller than the male and also differ by the grey-white underparts, a blackish ear patch, a short white supercilium/post-ocular streak and white- tipped outer tail feathers. Blue-tailed emeralds feed on insects and nectar. The song is a pleasant twittering, and the call of this species is a pebbly tsip.

It may loosely be thought of as a generalization of the gravitational potential of Newtonian gravitation. The metric captures all the geometric and causal structure of spacetime, being used to define notions such as time, distance, volume, curvature, angle, and separation of the future and the past. Notation and conventions Throughout this article we work with a metric signature that is mostly positive (); see sign convention. The gravitation constant G will be kept explicit. This article employs the Einstein summation convention, where repeated indices are automatically summed over. Definition Mathematically, spacetime is represented by a four-dimensional differentiable manifold M and the metric tensor is given as a covariant, second-degree, symmetric tensor on M, conventionally denoted by g. Moreover, the metric is required to be nondegenerate with signature . A manifold M equipped with such a metric is a type of Lorentzian manifold. Explicitly, the metric tensor is a symmetric bilinear form on each tangent space of M that varies in a smooth (or differentiable) manner from point to point. Given two tangent vectors u and v at a point x in M, the metric can be evaluated on u and v to give a real number: :g_x(u,v) = g_x(v,u) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. This is a generalization of the dot product of ordinary Euclidean space. Unlike Euclidean space - where the dot product is positive definite - the metric is indefinite and gives each tangent space the structure of Minkowski space. Local coordinates and matrix representations Physicists usually work in local coordinates (i.e. coordinates defined on some local patch of M). In local coordinates x^\\\\mu (where \\\\mu is an index that runs from 0 to 3) the metric can be written in the form :g = g_{\\\\mu u} dx^\\\\mu \\\\otimes dx^ u . The factors dx^\\\\mu are one-form gradients of the scalar coordinate fields x^\\\\mu. The metric is thus a linear combination of tensor products of one-form gradients of coordinates. The coefficients g_{\\\\mu u} are a set of 16 real-valued functions (since the tensor g is a tensor field, which is defined at all points of a spacetime manifold). In order for the metric to be symmetric we must have :g_{\\\\mu u} = g_{ u\\\\mu} , giving 10 independent coefficients. If the local coordinates are specified, or understood from context, the metric can be written as a symmetric matrix with entries g_{\\\\mu u}. The nondegeneracy of g_{\\\\mu u} means that this matrix is non-singular (i.e. has non-vanishing determinant), while the Lorentzian signature of g implies that the matrix has one negative and three positive eigenvalues. Note that physicists often refer to this matrix or the coordinates g_{\\\\mu u} themselves as the metric (see, however, abstract index notation). With the quantities dx^\\\\mu being regarded as the components of an infinitesimal coordinate displacement four-vector (not to be confused with the one-forms of the same notation above), the metric determines the invariant square of an infinitesimal line element, often referred to as an interval. The interval is often denoted :ds^2 = g_{\\\\mu u}dx^\\\\mu dx^ u . The interval ds^2 imparts information about the causal structure of spacetime. When ds^2 < 0, the interval is timelike and the square root of the absolute value of ds^2 is an incremental proper time. Only timelike intervals can be physically traversed by a massive object. When ds^2=0, the interval is lightlike, and can only be traversed by light. When ds^2 > 0, the interval is spacelike and the square root of ds^2 acts as an incremental proper length. Spacelike intervals cannot be traversed, since they connect events that are outside each other's light cones. Events can be causally related only if they are within each other's light cones. The components of the metric depend on the choice of local coordinate system. Under a change of coordinates x^\\\\mu \\\\to x^{\\\\bar \\\\mu}, the metric components transform as :g_{\\\\bar \\\\mu \\\\bar u} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial x^\\\\rho}{\\\\partial x^{\\\\bar \\\\mu}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^\\\\sigma}{\\\\partial x^{\\\\bar u}} g_{\\\\rho\\\\sigma} = \\\\Lambda^\\\\rho {}_{\\\\bar \\\\mu} \\\\, \\\\Lambda^\\\\sigma {}_{\\\\bar u} \\\\, g_{\\\\rho \\\\sigma} . Examples =Flat spacetime= The simplest example of a Lorentzian manifold is flat spacetime, which can be given as R4 with coordinates (t,x,y,z) and the metric :ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 = \\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} dx^{\\\\mu} dx^{ u}. \\\\, Note that these coordinates actually cover all of R4. The flat space metric (or Minkowski metric) is often denoted by the symbol η and is the metric used in special relativity. In the above coordinates, the matrix representation of η is :\\\\eta = \\\\begin{pmatrix}-c^2&0&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&1&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0&1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0&0&1\\\\end{pmatrix} (An alternative convention replaces coordinate t by ct, and defines \\\\eta as in .) In spherical coordinates (t,r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi), the flat space metric takes the form :ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\\\\Omega^2 \\\\, where :d\\\\Omega^2 = d\\\\theta^2 + \\\\sin^2\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\phi^2 is the standard metric on the 2-sphere. =Black hole metrics= The Schwarzschild metric describes an uncharged, non-rotating black hole. There are also metrics that describe rotating and charged black holes. Schwarzschild metric Besides the flat space metric the most important metric in general relativity is the Schwarzschild metric which can be given in one set of local coordinates by :ds^{2} = -\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{2GM}{rc^2} \\\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{2GM}{rc^2} \\\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\\\Omega^2 where, again, d\\\\Omega^2 is the standard metric on the 2-sphere. Here, G is the gravitation constant and M is a constant with the dimensions of mass. Its derivation can be found here. The Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric as M approaches zero (except at the origin where it is undefined). Similarly, when r goes to infinity, the Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric. With coordinates :\\\\left(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\\\\right)=(ct, r, \\\\theta, \\\\varphi) \\\\,, we can write the metric as :g_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\\\\right) & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{2GM}{r c^2}\\\\right)^{-1} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & r^2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & r^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,. Several other systems of coordinates have been devised for the Schwarzschild metric: Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates, Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates, Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates, and Lemaître coordinates. Rotating and charged black holes The Schwarzschild solution supposes an object that is not rotating in space and is not charged. To account for charge, the metric must satisfy the Einstein Field equations like before, as well as Maxwell's equations in a curved spacetime. A charged, non-rotating mass is described by the Reissner–Nordström metric. Rotating black holes are described by the Kerr metric and the Kerr–Newman metric. =Other metrics= Other notable metrics are: *Alcubierre metric, *de Sitter/anti-de Sitter metrics, *Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, *Isotropic coordinates, *Lemaître–Tolman metric (aka Bondi metric), *Peres metric, *Rindler coordinates, *Weyl−Lewis−Papapetrou coordinates, *Gödel metric. Some of them are without the event horizon or can be without the gravitational singularity.  Volume  The metric g induces a natural volume form (up to a sign), which can be used to integrate over a region of a manifold. Given local coordinates x^\\\\mu for the manifold, the volume form can be written :\\\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\det [g_{\\\\mu u}]}\\\\,dx^0\\\\wedge dx^1\\\\wedge dx^2\\\\wedge dx^3 where \\\\det[g_{\\\\mu u}] is the determinant of the matrix of components of the metric tensor for the given coordinate system. Curvature The metric g completely determines the curvature of spacetime. According to the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry, there is a unique connection ∇ on any semi-Riemannian manifold that is compatible with the metric and torsion-free. This connection is called the Levi-Civita connection. The Christoffel symbols of this connection are given in terms of partial derivatives of the metric in local coordinates x^\\\\mu by the formula :\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda {}_{\\\\mu u} = {1 \\\\over 2} g^{\\\\lambda\\\\rho} \\\\left( {\\\\partial g_{\\\\rho\\\\mu} \\\\over \\\\partial x^ u} + {\\\\partial g_{\\\\rho u} \\\\over \\\\partial x^\\\\mu} - {\\\\partial g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\over \\\\partial x^\\\\rho} \\\\right) = {1 \\\\over 2} g^{\\\\lambda\\\\rho} \\\\left( g_{\\\\rho\\\\mu, u} + g_{\\\\rho u,\\\\mu} - g_{\\\\mu u,\\\\rho} \\\\right) (where commas indicate partial derivatives). The curvature of spacetime is then given by the Riemann curvature tensor which is defined in terms of the Levi-Civita connection ∇. In local coordinates this tensor is given by: :{R^\\\\rho}_{\\\\sigma\\\\mu u} = \\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho {}_{ u\\\\sigma} \\\\- \\\\partial_ u\\\\Gamma^\\\\rho {}_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma} \\\\+ \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho {}_{\\\\mu\\\\lambda}\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda {}_{ u\\\\sigma} \\\\- \\\\Gamma^\\\\rho {}_{ u\\\\lambda}\\\\Gamma^\\\\lambda {}_{\\\\mu\\\\sigma}. The curvature is then expressible purely in terms of the metric g and its derivatives. Einstein's equations One of the core ideas of general relativity is that the metric (and the associated geometry of spacetime) is determined by the matter and energy content of spacetime. Einstein's field equations: : R_{\\\\mu u} - {1\\\\over 2}R g_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4} \\\\,T_{\\\\mu u} where the Ricci curvature tensor : R_{ u \\\\rho} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {R^{\\\\mu}}_{ u\\\\mu \\\\rho} and the scalar curvature : R \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ g^{\\\\mu u}R_{\\\\mu u} relate the metric (and the associated curvature tensors) to the stress–energy tensor T_{\\\\mu u}. This tensor equation is a complicated set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the metric components. Exact solutions of Einstein's field equations are very difficult to find.

If morphisms in a category are viewed as analogous to functions, then morphisms in a multicategory are analogous to functions of several variables. Multicategories are also sometimes called operads, or colored operads.  Definition  A (non-symmetric) multicategory consists of * a collection (often a proper class) of objects; * for every finite sequence (X_i)_{i \\\\in n} of objects (for von Neumann ordinal n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}) and object Y, a set of morphisms from (X_i)_{i \\\\in n} to Y; and * for every object X, a special identity morphism (with n = 1) from X to X. Additionally, there are composition operations: Given a sequence of sequences ((X_{ij})_{i \\\\in n_j})_{j \\\\in m} of objects, a sequence (Y_j)_{j \\\\in m} of objects, and an object Z: if * for each j \\\\in m, fj is a morphism from (X_{ij})_{i \\\\in n_j} to Yj; and * g is a morphism from (Y_j)_{j \\\\in m} to Z: then there is a composite morphism g(f_j)_{j \\\\in m} from (X_{ij})_{i \\\\in n_j, j \\\\in m} to Z. This must satisfy certain axioms: * If m = 1, Z = Y0, and g is the identity morphism for Y0, then g(f0) = f0; * if for each j \\\\in m, nj = 1, X_{0j} = Y_j, and fj is the identity morphism for Yj, then g(f_j)_{j \\\\in m} = g; and * an associativity condition: if for each j \\\\in m and i \\\\in n_j, e_{ij} is a morphism from (W_{hij})_{h \\\\in o_{ij}} to X_{ij}, then g\\\\left(f_j(e_{ij})_{i \\\\in n_j}\\\\right)_{j \\\\in m} = g(f_j)_{j \\\\in m}(e_{ij})_{i \\\\in n_j, j \\\\in m} are identical morphisms from (W_{hij})_{h \\\\in o_{ij}, i \\\\in n_j, j \\\\in m} to Z.  Comcategories  A comcategory (co-multi-category) is a totally ordered set O of objects, a set A of multiarrows with two functions \\\\mathrm{head}:A\\\\rightarrow O, \\\\mathrm{ground}:A\\\\rightarrow O^\\\\%, where O% is the set of all finite ordered sequences of elements of O. The dual image of a multiarrow f may be summarized f:\\\\mathrm{head}(f) \\\\Leftarrow \\\\mathrm{ground}(f). A comcategory C also has a multiproduct with the usual character of a composition operation. C is said to be associative if there holds a multiproduct axiom in relation to this operator. Any multicategory, symmetric or non-symmetric, together with a total-ordering of the object set, can be made into an equivalent comcategory. A multiorder is a comcategory satisfying the following conditions. * There is at most one multiarrow with given head and ground. * Each object x has a unit multiarrow. * A multiarrow is a unit if its ground has one entry. Multiorders are a generalization of partial orders (posets), and were first introduced (in passing) by Tom Leinster., Example 2.1.7, page 37  Examples  There is a multicategory whose objects are (small) sets, where a morphism from the sets X1, X2, ..., and Xn to the set Y is an n-ary function, that is a function from the Cartesian product X1 × X2 × ... × Xn to Y. There is a multicategory whose objects are vector spaces (over the rational numbers, say), where a morphism from the vector spaces X1, X2, ..., and Xn to the vector space Y is a multilinear operator, that is a linear transformation from the tensor product X1 ⊗ X2 ⊗ ... ⊗ Xn to Y. More generally, given any monoidal category C, there is a multicategory whose objects are objects of C, where a morphism from the C-objects X1, X2, ..., and Xn to the C-object Y is a C-morphism from the monoidal product of X1, X2, ..., and Xn to Y. An operad is a multicategory with one unique object; except in degenerate cases, such a multicategory does not come from a monoidal category. Examples of multiorders include pointed multisets , integer partitions , and combinatory separations . The triangles (or compositions) of any multiorder are morphisms of a (not necessarily associative) category of contractions and a comcategory of decompositions. The contraction category for the multiorder of multimin partitions is the simplest known category of multisets.  Applications  Multicategories are often incorrectly considered to belong to higher category theory, as their original application was the observation that the operators and identities satisfied by higher categories are the objects and multiarrows of a multicategory. The study of n-categories was in turn motivated by applications in algebraic topology and attempts to describe the homotopy theory of higher dimensional manifolds. However it has mostly grown out of this motivation and is now also considered to be part of pure mathematics. The correspondence between contractions and decompositions of triangles in a multiorder allows one to construct an associative algebra called its incidence algebra. Any element that is nonzero on all unit arrows has a compositional inverse, and the Möbius function of a multiorder is defined as the compositional inverse of the zeta function (constant-one) in its incidence algebra.  History  Multicategories were first introduced under that name by Jim Lambek in \\"Deductive systems and categories II\\" (1969). He mentions (p. 108) that he was \\"told that multicategories have also been studied by [Jean] Benabou and [Pierre] Cartier\\", and indeed Leinster opines that \\"the idea might have occurred to anyone who knew what both a category and a multilinear map were\\".

Formerly on Washington, D.C.'s 630 WMAL and host of The Chris Core Show from 9 a.m. to 11:45 a.m. EST, Marc Fisher of The Washington Post calls Core \\"a rare talker who gets the complexities of this region.\\" The program was one of the highest rated shows in the competitive drive time slot prior to being moved, mostly unchanged, to its morning slot. The show covered a wide variety of topics ranging from politics, the Global War on Terrorism, local and current affairs, show business, and others, until its cancellation on February 29, 2008. It was a \\"call in\\" type show where listeners were encouraged to call the show with their opinions. Core has maintained that he is neither a Democrat nor a Republican. The show often featured prominent local and national politicians who frequently called the show unsolicited. Core treated callers with respect regardless of their political stance. His show allowed people on both sides of an issue to express their opinions and allowed listeners to form their own opinions. Core also from time to time kept a caller on the line to discuss the topic at hand with other callers. Early life and education Core grew up in the small town of Clinton, Iowa. In 1971 Core graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in political science and theater and minor in Spanish. Three years later, he began his career at WMAL doing news and sports on the weekends. In 1976, Core replaced Ed Meyer as veteran news talker Bill Trumbull's cohost on the afternoon program \\"Two for the Road\\". Within a few years the name of the show was changed to The Trumbull and Core Show. Eventually this became The Chris Core Show. Brooke Stevens filled in as co-host following Bill Trumbull's retirement in 1996, prior to leaving the station in 2000. He currently resides in Chevy Chase, Maryland, with his wife, Anne, and his daughter, Tabitha. Career On February 29, 2008, Core was dismissed from WMAL after working for the station for over 33 years, as part of a broad shakeup at the station's parent company, Citadel Broadcasting. Core was dismissed following that day's show, leaving him without the opportunity to say goodbye to his audience. Core expressed hope to one day return to the air on a different station. WMAL host Chris Plante replaced Core in WMAL's morning lineup. In 2008, Core was hired as a feature commentator on Washington DC's news radio station WTOP. His commentary, \\"Core Values,\\" can be heard at 3:40, 6:10, and 8:40 pm. His commentaries can also be downloaded from the radio station's website. He starred in a commentary-style TV show, Chris Core Talks, on D.C.'s local CW station. He also serves as a guest host on XM Radio (Channel 130) \\"POTUS\\".  Awards and recognition  Core received the RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award in 2009, and was named one of three top radio personalities by readers of The Washington Times in their 2002 Readers' Choice awards; he was recently named one of the Top 100 Talk Show Hosts in the country by Talkers Magazine for the second year in a row.

He may write reportage, but he is open about who is reporting and how he feels about what he is reporting. One of the most interesting aspects of this material for the reader is the emergent relationship between observer-writer and subject. By revealing his attitudes to the subject he reveals much of himself. Vonnegut's association with the short story was far from over, however, and he later prepared and introduced a new collection, Welcome to the Monkey House (1968), which included eleven of the twelve stories from Canary in a Cathouse and fourteen others.

Biography Smith was born in Dwight, Illinois, in Livingston County He served as a United States Congressman from 1919 to 1921. Career Smith first ran for the Republican primary nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1920. In that first year of suffrage, women's votes were counted separately from men's in Illinois. He was beating William B. McKinley by 27,000 votes after the male votes were counted, but once the female votes were counted, McKinley had won by 11,000 votes. McKinley went on to win the general election as well. In 1921, Smith became the chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission, which oversaw utilities in the state. He prepared to run again for the Senate in 1926. At the time, Illinois had no campaign finance laws and Smith collected the unprecedented amount of $400,000 from several wealthy executives who ran public utilities, including $125,000 from Samuel Insull. In 1926 he defeated McKinley in the Republican primary for the Senate. Smith went on to win the general election held in November of that year, although Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck & Company had offered him $550,000 stock to withdraw.Ascoli, P. M. (2016). Julius Rosenwald the man who built Sears, Roebuck and advanced the cause of black education in the American South. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. McKinley, whose lame duck term would normally have extended until March 1927, died in December 1926, so Illinois Governor Len Small (R) appointed Smith to fulfill the rest of McKinley's term, a fairly common practice when the incumbent senator has died or otherwise ceased to serve. But when Smith presented his credentials as the newly appointed Senator, the U.S. Senate voted to not allow him to qualify as a senator, based upon alleged fraud and corruption in his campaign for the full term. In a new special election he tried again to qualify as the elected Senator in March 1927, but was again denied. He finally resigned his seat on February 9, 1928.Frank Lloyd Wright Library, Frank L.

Sturlunga saga (often called simply Sturlunga) is a collection of Icelandic sagas by various authors from the 12th and 13th centuries; it was assembled in about 1300. It mostly deals with the story of the Sturlungs, a powerful family clan during the Age of the Sturlungs period of the Icelandic Commonwealth. Sturlunga saga covers the history of Iceland between 1117 and 1264.\\"Sturlunga saga\\", Rudolf Simek and Hermann Pálsson, Lexikon der altnordischen Literatur, Kröners Taschenausgabe 490, Stuttgart: Kröner, 1987, , pp. 339-41 It begins with Geirmundar þáttr heljarskinns, the legend of Geirmundr heljarskinn, a regional ruler in late 9th-century Norway, who moves to Iceland to escape the growing power of King Harald Finehair.Jan de Vries, Altnordische Literaturgeschichte, Volume 2 Die Literatur von etwa 1150 bis 1300; die Spätzeit nach 1300, Grundriss der germanischen Philologie 16, 2nd ed. Berlin: de Gruyter, 1967, OCLC 270854789, p. 308 The more historical sagas commence in 1117 with Þorgils saga ok Hafliða. Other sagas included in the collection are Sturlu saga, Prestssaga Guðmundar Arasonar, Guðmundar saga biskups, Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar, Þórðar saga kakala, Svínfellinga saga and Íslendinga saga, composed by Sturla Þórðarson, which constitutes almost half of the compilation and covers the period 1183-1264. The compiler assembled the components in chronological order, added þættir including Geirmundar þáttr and Haukdæla þáttr and genealogies, and endeavoured to combine them into a single work, usually replacing the beginning and the ending with a linking passage.Sverrir Tómasson, \\"Old Icelandic Prose\\", in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. Daisy Neijmann, Histories of Scandinavian Literature 5, Lincoln, Nebraska / London: University of Nebraska, 2006, , pp. 64–173, 84-85. In some cases he broke up sagas to achieve chronological order.For details of all the components, see de Vries, pp. 308-13. The compilation is often thought of as constituting a genre of sagas, the samtíðarsögur or 'contemporary sagas'. Sturlunga saga is the main source of Icelandic history during the 12th and 13th centuries and was written by people who experienced the internal power struggle which ended in Iceland's loss of sovereignty and submission to Norway in 1262-64; the descriptions of wounds in Íslendinga saga are so detailed that they may be based on eyewitness accounts used in compensation claims.Sverrir, p. 85. It is also indispensable for the details of social history which it contains. Indirect evidence suggests that it was compiled by Þórðr Narfason (d. 1308),de Vries, p. 313. who may also have written Geirmundar þáttr and Haukdæla þáttr and possibly also Sturlu þáttr. The work is preserved in somewhat differing versions in two defective Western Icelandic parchments dating to the second half of the 14th century, the Króksfjarðarbók and the Reykjafjarðarbók (AM 122 a fol. and AM 122 b fol.), and in 17th- century paper manuscripts derived from these. The former also contains material from Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar; the latter contains interpolations from Þorgils saga Skarða and also contains Sturlu þáttr and two sagas which are not usually counted as part of Sturlunga saga, Jartegna saga Guðmundar biskups and Arna saga biskups.

It rises near Bungalow Farm on Cannwood Lane, south-west of Witham Friary, flows north through Blatchbridge to the town of Frome, and continues in a generally northerly direction to join the Bristol Avon at Freshford, below Bradford on Avon. The river is approximately in length, comprising 15 km from its source to the confluence with Maiden Bradley Brook, 10 km through Frome to the confluence with the Mells River, and 18 km to the Avon. Below Frome the river passes close to Beckington, Rode, Tellisford, Farleigh Hungerford and Iford Manor. The name Frome comes from the Old British word ffraw meaning fair, fine or brisk and describing the flow of the river. The name was first recorded in 701 when Pope Sergius gave permission to Bishop Aldhelm to found a monastery \\"close to the river which is called From\\" (Latin: \\"juxta fluvium qui vocatur From\\").Annette Burkitt, Flesh and Bones of Frome Selwood and Wessex, 2017, The Hobnob Press, p341  Weirs and bridges  There are many weirs on the river. Several stretches, particularly below Farleigh Hungerford, are used for coarse fishing and some trout fishing. There are many bridges on the river. In the centre of Frome, the first bridge perhaps appeared in the 14th century. A later 16th-century bridge was widened in the 18th century and buildings were built across it. It remains one of only three bridges in England that have buildings across them; the others are the Pulteney Bridge in Bath and the High Bridge in Lincoln. Other significant bridges include that at Wallbridge in Frome, dated 1634, upstream of the Frome bridge. Downstream are Rode bridge, a turnpike bridge from around 1777; Tellisford bridge, a packhorse bridge probably from the 17th century; Iford bridge, circa 1400; and Freshford bridge, 16th century. Ruins of a drying house, Willow Vale, Frome  Mills  Over the centuries, the river provided power to mills, at first for the grinding of flour. Later, as local industries developed, there were mills for fulling, dyewood grinding (with associated dyehouses) and grist for animal feed or brewing. In the 18th and early 19th century, there were more than 30 mills along the Frome and its tributaries, the Mells and Rodden Brook, from Freshford to four miles south of Frome. Some of the structures can still be seen today: Tellisford, Rode, the upstream mill at Wallbridge, Frome and Blatchbridge. Others have vanished. In Frome a large complex of factory buildings for the woollen industry, with associated workers' cottages in Innox Hill, was established at Spring Gardens by the Sheppard family; these have now disappeared. The Town Mill stood just upstream of Frome bridge; all that is left are linked buildings: a semi-ruinous drying house and buildings for warehousing, dyehouses and storage, most converted to residences. The last textile mill, Tuckers, further downstream at Wallbridge, closed in 1956.  Incidents  On 2 May 1932, five boys, one of them on his 10th birthday, were watching floodwater from part of an old mill just upstream from the main bridge in Frome. The old masonry collapsed; the youngest boy, aged 9, was pulled out by friends. A police constable dived in to save the others; the waters took him through the arches of the main bridge but then his cape was caught up by branches and he was pulled out. The next day four bodies were retrieved at Welshmill. The police officer was awarded the King's Police Medal for Bravery for his attempt to save their lives. In January 2013, a policeman rescued a man from the river near the Cheese & Grain in the centre of Frome; he pulled the unconscious man from the freezing water and up the steep banks to save his life. The constable was awarded a Royal Humane Society Bravery Award. In May 2016, the director of Cross Keys Farm Ltd, Frome, pleaded guilty to causing an unpermitted water discharge into the River Frome. The farm released slurry which killed at least 1,700 fish in the river, and caused considerable damage to its ecosystem. The stretch of river immediately downstream from the farm was a popular swimming, fishing, and canoeing site; these activities were ceased under health concerns. In order to protect the ecosystem, hydrogen peroxide was sprayed into the river to restore oxygen levels for fish, animal, and plant life. The director of the farm was fined more than £22,000.

Ganassa's real name was probably Alberto NaseliHartnoll 1983, \\"Ganassa, Zan\\" pp. 313–314. (also spelled Naselli). He was known for playing zanni, comic servant roles, hence his stage name, and is one of the first actors believed to have played the zanni subtype known as Harlequin (Arlecchino in Italian), which subsequently became one of the most important leading roles in Commedia dell'arte plays.Senelick 1995b, p. 472. Ganassa is first mentioned in 1568 as the leader of a troupe in Mantua. After his troupe had performed in Paris in 1571, they were invited by Charles IX of France to take part of the festivities surrounding the marriage of the King of Navarre (later Henry IV) to Charles's sister Marguerite de Valois in August 1572.Baschet 1882, pp. 24–26. From 1574 to 1584 Ganassa performed in Spain during the reign of Philip II, where he exerted considerable influence on early Spanish professional theatre. He was so popular that the authorities in Seville withdrew the troupe's license: workers were neglecting their jobs in order to see the plays. Ganassa is mentioned numerous times by Lope de Vega, who may have based his comic servant gracioso on Commedia dell'arte types. The gracioso later became a stock character of Spanish comedia. During this period, it was common for theatre companies to set up their stages right before a performance and take down everything immediately after. Ganassa recognized what a burden this would be and donated to the city of Madrid to create a theatre known as Corral de la Pacheca, which is the first ever permanent theatre in Madrid. Ganassa guaranteed himself tenancy in this theatre by a 9–10-year lease from its owner, Isabel Pacheco, by persuading the Cofrades. Ganassa also donated again to the Cofrades in 1582 to help build the second permanent theatre space of Madrid, the Corral del Príncipe. References Notes Sources * Banham, Martin, editor (1995).

It is to be distinguished from another River Frome in Gloucestershire, the Bristol Frome, and the nearby River Frome, Herefordshire. The river is approximately long. Course The Stroud Frome rises from several springs at Nettleton (about a mile southeast of Birdlip)Source - Nettleton springs and in springs at Climperwell Farm (southwest of Brimpsfield). The two branches meet in Miserden Park, just south of Caudle Green and Syde. The Frome continues to meander its way south to Sapperton, then west to Brimscombe where it turns northwest towards Stroud. The river flows through Stroud, past the Frome Banks nature reserve, then through Ebley and Stonehouse where it goes under the M5 motorway, and past Saul to enter the River Severn at Upper Framilode.Mouth - Upper Framilode At Caudle Green the eastern side of the valley rises to the North Sea/Atlantic watershed, approximately one mile to the east. The Frome basin shares a length of this watershed feeding into the River Thames to the east (via the River Churn) and the Severn to the West (via the Frome). The Golden Valley in Autumn Stroudwater Canal Below Sapperton the Frome runs adjacent to the Thames and Severn Canal which is now disused, although undergoing restoration. This joins the Stroudwater Navigation (Stroudwater Canal) at Wallbridge. The Stroudwater Navigation is fed by the Slad Brook and the Painswick stream. Changes to water drainage to reduce flooding, carried out by the Severn River Board in 1957 and 1958, resulted in the Randwick brook (the Ozlebrook) discharging into the canal route instead of passing under it by way of a siphon beneath Foundry Lock. The Stroudwater Navigation runs parallel to the Frome for most of its length westwards from Stroud, and was an important and essential part of Stroud's growth as a town. At one time there was an access route for craft to enter the Frome in Dudbridge meadows, and to reach Kimmins Mill. The canal was a thriving thoroughfare for trade, putting Stroud on the map during the industrial revolution. At Stonehouse the river was part of a novel, ill-fated, scheme by John Kemmett and others, in the 1760s, to create a canal without locks. Goods would be carried on boats in containers, each capable of holding about one ton, and the containers would be transferred from one level to the next by cranes erected wherever there was a mill weir. The scheme proved to be too costly, and was abandoned after about of river had been improved. Golden Valley The valley from Chalford to Stroud, known as the Golden Valley, is one of the Stroud Five Valleys; it carries the railway line and the Thames and Severn Canal to the Sapperton Tunnels under the Cotswolds. The Sapperton Valley nature reserve is one of several in the area.

It lies halfway between the town of Clifden and the city of Galway. Irish is the predominant spoken language. The District Electoral Division of Turlough, Rosmuc, state that Rosmuc is the most strongly Irish-speaking area in the country. The townland of Rosmuck is part of the civil parish of Kilcummin.Placenames Database of Ireland - townland of Rosmuck  History and etymology  It is estimated that people first settled in Rosmuc in AD 400, one hundred years before Naomh Briocán (Saint Briocán) brought Christianity to the area. It is believed that the name 'Ros Muc' comes from the old Irish \\"the peninsula of rounded hills\\", ros meaning \\"promontory  headland\\" and muc meaning \\"rounded hills\\" or \\"pig\\" as in the rounded hills on the horizon surrounding the district look like the rounded backs of farm animals. The Irish word for peninsula is leithinis and seems to have a slightly different connotation than the meaning of ros.  Population  The population of Rosmuc is estimated to be around four hundred fifty people. For the past thirty years there has been a decline in the population, this is mainly due to emigration, although the tide of emigration has subsided in recent years due to the robust nature of the Irish economy.  Irish language  There are 557 people living in the Ros Muc ED and 87% are native Irish speakers. According to an analysis of the census a total of 91.9% of adults over nineteen years old said they spoke Irish on a daily basis. The area has many literary figures, notably Irish revolutionary and education/language activist Patrick Pearse (Pádraig Mac Piarais)  (An Ṗiarsaċ) who had a summer residence there in the early 1900s (now a National Monument/Heritage Site open to the public), and who set many of his short stories in the area. Another writer was the prolific Pádraic Ó Conaire, who wrote 26 books, 473 stories, 237 essays and 6 plays partly set in the region, including M'asal Beag Dubh (My Little Black Donkey) and the novella Deoraíocht (Exile). The area is recognised as one of the strongest remaining Gaeltacht areas in South Connemara. Pádraig Pearse, who was involved in the 1916 revolution in Dublin had a cottage in Rosmuc where he wrote many of his pieces. It was in Rosmuc that he wrote the oration given at the grave of Ó Donnabháin Rosa (O'Donovan Rossa) in 1915, which included the immortal words \\" ... but, the fools, the fools, the fools! — They have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.\\" Rosmuc has had a long term relationship with Coláiste na bhFiann as it provides host accommodation for students learning Irish during the summer months.  Gaelic sports  An association football team is based in Rosmuc, called Cumann Sacar Naomh Briocain (affiliated with the FAI and playing in the Galway district league) Naomh Briocain also has players from neighbouring parishes, most notably Cill Chairain, Carna and Letir Mor. The youth teams up to minors are called \\"Carna Caiseal Na Piarsaigh\\". It has a mixture of players from Rosmuc, Camus,Kilkerrin and Carna. Their under 12s team won the double in 2015 and their league and reaching the final of the other one only to lose out to An Spidéal. Rosmuc along with its neighbours Camus and An Sraith Salach have a GAA Football between them called Na Piarsaigh. The village is the birthplace of a former president of the Gaelic League, Proinsias Mac Aonghusa.

Former residents Pearse's Cottage Rosmuc's most famous and historic landmark is Pearse's Cottage, which attracts up to ten thousand visitors each year. It was April 1903 when P.H. Pearse (Irish: Pádraig Mac Piarais) first came to Rosmuc as an examiner for Conradh na Gaeilge. Rosmuc and its people made an impression on him, and he decided to build a holiday home there. He bought a site from Jeanín Mhichíl Grealish - a spot with views of Loch Eiliúrach. Máirtín Labhráis Nee and Tom Labhráis Nee built a two-bed roomed-thatched cottage for him. Bartley Mannion did the carpentry work on the cottage.

It is considered a Ghanaian musical style. In the 1980s, reggae music was gaining popularity worldwide and was carrying with it a growing popularity for other forms of world music that were easy to dance to. Highlife music, often fused with reggae, gained a wider audience in Europe and North America at this time. During the late 1970s-early 1980s, there was a massive exodus of Ghanaians such as Seidu Mohammed to foreign lands. One of the countries that attracted Ghanaians was Germany, with many making the cities of Berlin, Düsseldorf and Hamburg their second home. Burger-Highlife was born when Ghanaian musicians in Germany started collaborating with German musicians and producers. They created a crossover music style from highlife, disco and funk music. This creation of a cross-cultural fertilization between two nations and two different cultures bears all the significant hallmarks of co-operation. People from different cultural backgrounds came together, exchanged thoughts, ideas and hopes and by doing so, they created something new and exciting that had an instant appeal and a lasting impact on Ghana and the Ghanaian and other communities worldwide.

Shell money usually consisted of whole or partial sea shells, often worked into beads or otherwise shaped. The use of shells in trade began as direct commodity exchange, the shells having value as body ornamentation. The distinction between beads as commodities and beads as money has been the subject of debate among economic anthropologists.Davies 1994, Mauss 1950, Trubitt 2003 Shell money has appeared in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia. The most familiar form may be the wampum created by the Indigenous peoples of the East Coast of North America, ground beads cut from the purple part of marine bivalve shells. The shell most widely used worldwide as currency was the shell of Cypraea moneta, the money cowry. This species is most abundant in the Indian Ocean, and was collected in the Maldive Islands, in Sri Lanka, along the Malabar coast, in Borneo and on other East Indian islands, and in various parts of the African coast from Ras Hafun to Mozambique. Cowry shell money was an important part of the trade networks of Africa, South Asia, and East Asia. 1742 drawing of shells of the money cowry, Cypraea moneta North America Antiquities of the southern Indians, particularly of the Georgia tribes (1873) On the east coast of North America, Indigenous peoples of the Iroquois Confederacy and Algonquian tribes, such as the Shinnecock tribe, ground beads called wampum, which were cut from the purple part of the shell of the marine bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria, more commonly known as the hard clam or quahog.Geary, Theresa Flores. The Illustrated Bead Bible. London: Kensington Publications, 2008: 305. . White beads were cut from the white part of the quahog or whelk shells. Iroquois peoples strung these shells on string in lengths, or wove them in belts. The shell most valued by the Native American tribes of the Pacific Coast from Alaska to northwest California was 'Dentalium', one of several species of tusk shell or scaphopod. The tusk shell is naturally open at both ends, and can easily be strung on a thread. This shell money was valued by its length rather than the exact number of shells; the \\"ligua\\", the highest denomination in their currency, was a length of about 6 inches. Farther south, in central California and southern California, the shell of the olive snail Olivella biplicata was used to make beads for at least 9,000 years. The small numbers recovered in older archaeological site components suggest that they were initially used as ornamentation, rather than as money.Hughes and Milliken 2007 Beginning shortly before 1,000 years ago, Chumash specialists on the islands of California's Santa Barbara Channel began chipping beads from olive shells in such quantities that they left meter-deep piles of manufacturing residue in their wake; the resulting circular beads were used as money throughout the area that is now southern California.Arnold and Graesch 2001 Starting at about AD 1500, and continuing into the late nineteenth century, the Coast Miwok, Ohlone, Patwin, Pomo, and Wappo peoples of central California used the marine bivalve Saxidomus sp. to make shell money.Chagnon 1970; Milliken et al. 2007:117; Vayda 1967. Africa A print from 1845 shows cowry shells being used as money by an Arab trader In western Africa, shell money was usual legal tender up until the mid 19th century. Before the abolition of the slave trade, large shipments of cowry shells were sent to some of the English ports for reshipment to the slave coast. The shells of Olivella nana, the sparkling dwarf olive sea snail were harvested on Luanda Island for use as currency in the Kingdom of Kongo. They were even traded north as far as the Kingdom of Benin. In the Kongo they were called nzimbu or zimbo.Jan Hogendorn and Marion Johnson, The Shell Money of the Slave Trade (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 19. As the value of the cowry was much greater in West Africa than in the regions from which the supply was obtained, the trade was extremely lucrative. In some cases the gains are said to have been 500%. The use of the cowry currency gradually spread inland in Africa. By about 1850 the German explorer Heinrich Barth found it fairly widespread in Kano, Kuka, Gando, and even Timbuktu. Barth relates that in Muniyoma, one of the ancient divisions of Bornu, the king's revenue was estimated at 30,000,000 shells, with every adult male being required to pay annually 1,000 shells for himself, 1,000 for every pack-ox, and 2,000 for every slave in his possession. In the countries on the coast, the shells were fastened together in strings of forty or one-hundred each, so that fifty or twenty strings represented a dollar; but in the interior they were laboriously counted one by one, or, if the traders were expert, five by five. The districts mentioned above received their supply of kurdi, as they were called, from the west coast; but the regions to the north of Unyamwezi, where they were in use under the name of simbi, were dependent on Muslim traders from Zanzibar. The shells were used in the remoter parts of Africa until the early 20th century, but then gave way to modern currencies. The shell of the large land snail, Achatina monetaria, cut into circles with an open center was also used as coin in Benguella, Portuguese West Africa. Asia Chinese shell money, 16-18th century BCE Money Cowry; Length 2.6 cm; Palou Tello, Batu Islands, Indonesia In China, cowries were so important that many characters relating to money or trade contain the character for cowry: 貝. Starting over three thousand years ago, cowry shells, or copies of the shells, were used as Chinese currency.\\"Money Cowries\\" by Ardis Doolin in Hawaiian Shell News, NSN #306, June, 1985 The Classical Chinese character for \\"money/currency\\", 貝, originated as a pictograph of a cowrie shell.References listed at http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/貝 . Cowries were formerly used as means of exchange in India. In Bengal, where it required 3840 to make a rupee, the annual importation was valued at about 30,000 rupees. In Southeast Asia, when the value of the Siamese tical (baht) was about half a troy ounce of silver (about 16 grams), the value of the cowrie ( bia) was fixed at Baht. In modern Thailand, it refers to interest paid for the use of money borrowed or deposited; bia wat is a military pension.Royal Institute Dictionary (1982) In Orissa, India, cowry (popularly known as kaudi) was used as currency until 1805 when it was abolished by the British East India Company and rupee was enforced. This was one of the causes of the Paik Rebellion in 1817. Oceania and Australia Papua New Guinea shell money In northern Australia, different shells were used by different tribes, one tribe's shell often being quite worthless in the eyes of another tribe. In the islands north of New Guinea the shells were broken into flakes. Holes were bored through these flakes, which were then valued by the length of a threaded set on a string, as measured using the finger joints. Two shells are used by these Pacific islanders, one a cowry found on the New Guinea coast, and the other the common pearl shell, broken into flakes. In the South Pacific Islands the species Oliva carneola was commonly used to create shell money. As late as 1882, local trade in the Solomon Islands was carried on by means of a coinage of shell beads, small shells laboriously ground down to the required size by the women. No more than were actually needed were made, and as the process was difficult, the value of the coinage was satisfactorily maintained. Although rapidly being replaced by modern coinage, the cowry shell currency is still in use to some extent in the Solomon Islands. The shells are worked into strips of decorated cloth whose value reflects the time spent creating them. On the Papua New Guinea island of East New Britain, shell currency is still considered legal currency and can be exchanged for the Papua New Guinean kina. Middle East In parts of West Asia, Cypraea annulus, the ring cowry, so-called because of the bright orange- colored ring on the back or upper side of the shell, was commonly used. Many specimens were found by Sir Austen Henry Layard in his excavations at Nimrud in 1845–1851.

The band is considered among the pioneers of hardcore punk, particularly in the Midwest region. Like most hardcore bands, Negative Approach was little known in its day outside of its hometown. It is now idolized in the Detroit rock underground and the punk subculture, considered to be one of the elite bands of the \\"old school\\" era, and continues to be influential. Negative Approach initially broke up in 1984 with singer John Brannon moving on to the Laughing Hyenas, and later Easy Action, but the band has reformed as of 2006 and continues to tour sporadically. Biography =Main career (1981-1983)= Negative Approach was formed in August 1981 in Detroit, Michigan by Brannon and Pete Zelewski, supposedly after seeing a Black Flag/Necros show. The first NA lineup consisted of Brannon on vocals, Rob McCulloch on guitar, Pete Zelewski on bass and Zuheir Fakhoury on drums. Not long after, Zelewski left the band to form the Allied and was replaced by McCulloch's brother Graham. Fakhoury was later replaced by Chris \\"Opie\\" Moore. The lineup of Brannon/McCulloch/McCulloch/Moore would remain unchanged until NA disbanded. John Brannon. NA's first gig was in the basement of Necros drummer Todd Swalla's mother's home. Soon after, they recorded a demo, and followed that up with an appearance on the Process of Elimination compilation 7\\" EP, released on Meatmen frontman Tesco Vee's fledgling Touch and Go label, named after his fanzine of the same name. The comp also featured the Meatmen and Necros, among others. NA, the Meatmen and Necros then embarked on the Process of Elimination tour. Although this \\"tour\\" consisted of a mere three shows (Boston, New York City and Washington, DC), it is cited as being a key event in the early spread of hardcore. The first proper Negative Approach studio release came in 1982 with their self-titled 7\\" EP, also on Touch and Go. It contained \\"Can't Tell No One,\\" \\"Ready to Fight\\" and \\"Nothing\\", the latter considered by many to be the quintessential NA song. The following year saw the release of the Tied Down album, also venerated as a hardcore classic. The classic lineup fell apart in 1983. Rob McCulloch claims that the band had grown weary of the group's reputation for writing negative lyrics but that Brannon was not comfortable writing differently. Also, McCulloch stated that Brannon's involvement with Larissa Stolarchuk from L-Seven was another source of tension for the group. The band regrouped long enough to record the Tied Down albumP, then split for good. Afterwards, Brannon assembled a new lineup with members Kelly Dermody (guitar), Dave (bass) and Mike McCabe (drums). This version of Negative Approach played a series of live shows throughout 1984 which featured some new songs, such as \\"Obsession\\", \\"Tunnel Vision\\", \\"Kiss Me Kill Me\\" and a cover of \\"I Got a Right\\" by the Stooges. This lineup was documented on the Live at the Newtown Theater bootleg 7\\" and some live tracks recorded at Boston's Paradise Rock Club that appeared on the Total Recall CD collection. The new lineup split during the first week of their tour in support of Tied Down, playing their last show in Memphis. =Post-breakup (1983-2006)= Brannon with Easy Action at Mac's Bar, Lansing, Michigan on November 8, 2008 Brannon went on to front the punk blues band Laughing Hyenas with his girlfriend Stolarchuk (then calling herself \\"Larissa Strickland\\"), and sings for Easy Action. In 2008, Brannon recorded vocals for two songs on Vitamin X's album Full Scale Assault, recorded by Steve Albini. Moore moved out from behind the drums to front alt-rock act Crossed Wire along with Rob McCulloch. After Crossed Wire, McCulloch attended college and has not pursued a career in music, although he maintains a home recording studio. Moore later embarked on a respected solo career as a roots-oriented singer and songwriter. His band Moore & Sons, featuring Lambchop member Dennis Cronin, signed to the UK's Triumphant Sounds/Drawing Room label. Graham McCulloch moved to Washington, DC and joined the Meatmen, before forming Earth 18 with John \\"Bubba\\" Dupree (formerly of Void). Earth 18 released several albums and toured the US, opening for Nitzer Ebb. After Earth 18 disbanded, McCulloch played for several years in Mother May I. =Reunion (2006-present)= On May 2006, it was announced that Brannon and Moore would play a Negative Approach reunion show of sorts, for Touch and Go's 25th anniversary show on September 9, 2006, as well as two later shows in the UK (London on December 7 and at All Tomorrow's Parties on December 10). Despite repeated efforts by Rob and Graham McCulloch to be a part of the reunion and have the classic NA lineup play, Brannon refused. It was instead announced that Harold Richardson (of Easy Action) and Ron Sakowski (formerly of Easy Action, Laughing Hyenas and Necros) would complete the lineup. Negative Approach closed out the No Fun Fest in Brooklyn, New York on May 20, 2007. Thurston Moore played guitar on two songs at the start of their set. The band did a brief reunion tour in the northeast United States in April 2008, performing in Brooklyn and Providence. They also played the wedding of Anal Cunt founder Seth Putnam. The band did a lengthier tour of Europe in June 2008, and later that year, a concert in Los Angeles. In 2009, they played a string of shows in the U.S. From left: Richard Bowser of Violent Apathy, Scott Boman of the Degenerates and Spite, and John Brannon of Negative Approach. Picture taken at the St. Andrews Hall show on July 31, 2010On July 31, 2010, Negative Approach played a book release party for Tony Rettman's Why Be Something That You're Not at St. Andrew's Hall in Detroit with other bands reflecting the formative years of the Midwest hardcore scene such as Tesco Vee's Hate Police, Sorcen, Violent Apathy and Hellmouth. The book was titled after a Negative Approach song, and included interviews with artists from the Detroit hardcore scene. The tour also featured the signing of the book Touch and Go: The Complete Hardcore Punk Zine '79–'83 written by Vee and Dave Stimson and edited by Steve Miller. In 2010, Brannon discovered several unreleased Negative Approach recordings, including the lost 1984 sessions of unreleased studio tracks. After meeting Brannon, Curtis Casella of Taang! Records offered to release the recordings, which include \\"Friends of No One\\", \\"Cargo Cult\\" \\"Kiss Me Kill Me\\", \\"Obsession\\", \\"Genocide\\" and a studio version of \\"I Got a Right\\". The tapes were brought to Jim Diamond to restore and preserve. In November 2011, Taang! released the recordings on the Nothing Will Stand in Our Way album, around the time that the band played the Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin with former Swirlies drummer Anthony DeLuca manning the kit in place of Moore. This lineup toured extensively throughout 2012 including a month in the U.S. with Off! and a month in Europe with Punch. Influences and style Negative Approach's musical style was based on Detroit proto-punk icons the Stooges. Of the Stooges' guitarist Ron Asheton, John Brannon said, \\"So much of what NA stands for; our sound and lyrics were based on the music which he helped to create.\\" NA were also influenced by high-octane British hardcore punk (especially Discharge) and Oi! music (Blitz, 4-Skins, Sham 69, etc.), although from the start, their sound and demeanor were considerably more aggressive and brutal than that of their influences. NA's brand of hardcore was savage and nihilistic, exuding frustration, pessimism, and rage. This was personified in vocalist Brannon, an intimidating and intense young man with a shaved head, piercing stare, and belligerent attitude. His vocal style and stage presence set the standard for those that followed.

It was released on February 22, 1994, by Flipside. The album shows a strong folk influence, consisting of home recordings, studio recordings, live performances, field recordings, sound collages, and abstract noise experiments. A lo-fi recording of largely anti-commercial nature, Stereopathetic Soulmanure is Beck's third official recording, the first two being Golden Feelings and A Western Harvest Field by Moonlight. Beck would soon return with the mostly acoustic One Foot in the Grave and Mellow Gold before recording his major label follow-up Odelay (1996). As of July 2008, Stereopathetic Soulmanure has sold over 146,000 copies in the United States.

He got his first camera from his father, who bought it from Goldblatt's brother, who had brought home a damaged German Contax camera when he came back from serving in World War II. Though his first photographs were not groundbreaking, he enlisted help from a wedding photographer: \\"He would drape several cameras around my neck so that I looked very professional, and my job was to ensure that no guest with a good camera got a good picture . . . I would have to bump or walk in front of them at the critical moment so that my boss was the only person who ended up with good photographs.” A couple years later in 1963, as his skill developed, he sold the clothing shop that he had taken over on the death of his father in 1962, and became a full-time photographer. He documented developments in South Africa through the period of apartheid until it ended in the 1990s. However he was still making photographs up until his death in 2018. Throughout his years as a photographer, Goldblatt never saw himself as an artist, and he was uncomfortable being seen as one. Many agree that he was a documentarian more than he was an artist. Goldblatt had an innovative approach to documentary photography.Bester, Rory. “David Goldblatt’s Making Visible: Photographic Strategies of Rumination, Orchestration and Circulation.” Social Dynamics, vol. 36, no. 1, Mar. 2010, pp. 153–165. EBSCOhost, . He made a life of photographing the issues that went beyond the events of apartheid and documented the conditions that led to them. Goldblatt was never comfortable with the fine art world. He went to exhibition openings but secretly hated the attention they threw upon him. He got around the label of artist by simply calling himself a photographer. He said: \\"I am a self-appointed observer and critic of the society into which I was born, with a tendency to giving recognition to what is overlooked or unseen.\\" Goldblatt's photography was not obviously politically charged. He claimed he was not an activist, unlike the majority of his friends and other photographers during this time.Goldblatt, David, and Jonathan Cane. “David Goldblatt.” Aperture, no. 220, 2015, pp. 108–121. JSTOR. He in turn was looked down upon and disrespected for not involving himself in activism, on which he commented: \\"I wasn't prepared to compromise what I regarded as my particular needs.\\" During Apartheid, Goldblatt in his work The Transported of KwaNdebele documented the excruciatingly long and uncomfortable twice-daily bus journeys of black workers who lived in the segregated \\"homelands\\" northeast of Pretoria. The conditions had not changed that much for workers by 2007: \\"The bulk of people who live there still have to travel to Pretoria by road. It's still a very long commute for them every day – two to eight hours. . . . It will take generations to undo the consequences of Apartheid.\\" After apartheid, Goldblatt continued to photograph within South Africa, particularly its landscapes. In the work Goldblatt created during apartheid he never photographed in colour. Goldblatt observed that: \\"the use of colour during apartheid would have been inappropriate. It would have enhanced the beautiful and the personal, whereas black and white photographs to more effectively documented the external dramatic contradictions that defined this earlier period.\\" In the 1990s he began working in colour, in a sense adapting to the digital age. \\"I’ve found the venture into color quite exciting . . . largely because new technology has enabled me to work with color on the computer as I have done with black and white in the darkroom.\\" It was only after working on a project involving blue asbestos in north-western Australia, and \\"the resulting disease and death\\", that he \\"got hooked on doing work in color [because] You can’t make it blue in black and white.\\" This was coupled with new developments in digital scanning and printing. Only when Goldblatt was able to achieve the same \\"depth\\" in his colour work that he had previously achieved in his black and white photography did he choose to explore this extensively. Collections and publications Goldblatt's work is held in major museum collections worldwide. Interest in Goldblatt's work increased significantly after a travelling exhibition of 51 years of his work (Barcelona, 2001), and the eleventh Documenta (Kassel, 2002). The former, which opened in the AXA Gallery in New York in 2001, offered an overview of Goldblatt's photographic oeuvre from 1948 to 1999. At Documenta, two projects were shown: black-and-white work depicting life in the middle-class white community of Boksburg in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as examples of later colour work from the series Johannesburg Intersections. Goldblatt's book South Africa: The Structure of Things Then, published in 1998, offers an in-depth visual analysis of the relationship between South Africa's structures and the forces that shaped them, from the country's early colonial beginnings up until 1990. Influences Goldblatt was inspired by photography in magazines such as Life, Look and Picture Post, which helped him with things such as captioning his photographs. Goldblatt also cited writers and visual artists as his major influences, among them Jillian Becker, Guy Tillim, Herman Charles Bosman, Nadine Gordimer, Njabulo Ndebele, Ivan Vladislavic and playwright Barney Simon. Herman Charles Bosman specifically helped inspire Goldblatt in his second photo essay titled The South African Tatler. Goldblatt helped influence the work of the photographer Santu Mofokeng as they studied together during the time of apartheid.Firstenberg, Lauri. “Representing the Body Archivally in South African Photography.” Art Journal, vol. 61, no. 1, Mar. 2002, pp. 58–67. . Together they helped reinvent documentary and conceptual modes of photography, which led them to prominence and influence within documentary photography. Later life After founding the Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg in 1989,https://marketphotoworkshop.co.za/about/ Goldblatt turned no photographer, struggling or famous away from his door. He was always accessible to everyone no matter what, even in his later life. Goldblatt died on 25 June 2018 in Johannesburg from cancer.David Goldblatt, Acclaimed South African Photographer, Dies at 87 He had created photographs up until his death. He was survived by his wife, Lily Goldblatt and his children Steven, Brenda and Ronnie; and two grandchildren. Publications * On the Mines. With Nadine Gordimer.

A binary tree is the special case where m = 2, and a ternary tree is another case with m = 3 that limits its children to three. Types of m-ary trees * A full m-ary tree is an m-ary tree where within each level every node has either 0 or m children. * A complete m-ary tree is an m-ary tree which is maximally space efficient. It must be completely filled on every level except for the last level. However, if the last level is not complete, then all nodes of the tree must be \\"as far left as possible\\". * A perfect m-ary tree is a full m-ary tree in which all leaf nodes are at the same depth. Properties of m-ary trees * For an m-ary tree with height h, the upper bound for the maximum number of leaves is m^h. * The height h of an m-ary tree does not include the root node, with a tree containing only a root node having a height of 0\\\\. * The height of a tree is equal to the maximum depth D of any node in the tree. * The total number of nodes N in a perfect m-ary tree is \\\\sum_{i=0}^h m^i = \\\\frac{m^{h+1} - 1}{m-1}, while the height h is :: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\frac{m^{h+1} - 1}{m-1} \\\\geq N > \\\\frac{m^h - 1}{m-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & m^{h+1} \\\\geq (m - 1) \\\\cdot N + 1 > m^h \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & h+1 \\\\geq \\\\log_m \\\\left((m - 1) \\\\cdot N + 1\\\\right) > h \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & h \\\\ge \\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\log_m ((m - 1) \\\\cdot N + 1) - 1\\\\right\\\\rceil. \\\\end{align} :By the definition of Big-Ω, the maximum depth ::D = h \\\\ge \\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\log_m ((m - 1) \\\\cdot N + 1) - 1\\\\right\\\\rceil =O(\\\\log_m n) = O(\\\\log n/\\\\log m) * The height of a complete m-ary tree with n nodes is \\\\lfloor \\\\log_m ((m-1)\\\\cdot n) \\\\rfloor. * The total number of possible m-ary tree with n nodes is C_n = \\\\frac{1}{(m-1)n+1} \\\\cdot \\\\binom{m \\\\cdot n}{n} (which is a Catalan number) .  Traversal methods for m-ary trees Traversing a m-ary tree is very similar to binary tree traversal. The pre-order traversal goes to parent, left subtree and the right subtree, and for traversing post-order it goes by left subtree, right subtree, and parent node. For traversing in-order, since there are more than two children per node for m > 2, one must define the notion of left and right subtrees. One common method to establish left/right subtrees is to divide the list of children nodes into two groups. By defining an order on the m children of a node, the first \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\rfloor \\\\\\\\} nodes would constitute the left subtree and \\\\\\\\{\\\\lceil \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\rceil, \\\\dots , m\\\\\\\\} nodes would constitute the right subtree. Convert a m-ary tree to binary tree An example of conversion of a m-ary tree to a binary tree.m=6 Using an array for representing a m-ary tree is inefficient, because most of the nodes in practical applications contain less than m children. As a result, this fact leads to a sparse array with large unused space in the memory. Converting an arbitrary m-ary tree to a binary tree would only increase the height of the tree by a constant factor and would not affect the overall worst-case time complexity. In other words, O(\\\\log_m n)\\\\equiv O(\\\\log_2 n) since \\\\log_2 m \\\\cdot \\\\log_m n =\\\\frac{\\\\log m}{\\\\log 2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\log n}{\\\\log m} = \\\\log_2 n. First, we link all the immediate children nodes of a given parent node together in order to form a link list. Then, we keep the link from the parent to the first (i.e., the leftmost) child and remove all the other links to the rest of the children. We repeat this process for all the children (if they have any children) until we have processed all the internal nodes and rotate the tree by 45 degrees clockwise. The tree obtained is the desired binary tree obtained from the given m-ary tree. Methods for storing m-ary trees =Arrays= An example of storing a m-ary tree with m=3 in an array m-ary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an implicit data structure in arrays, and if the tree is a complete m-ary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index i, its c-th child in range {1,...,m} is found at index m\\\\cdot i+c, while its parent (if any) is found at index \\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{i-1}{m} \\\\right \\\\rfloor (assuming the root has index zero, meaning a 0-based array). This method benefits from more compact storage and better locality of reference, particularly during a preorder traversal. The space complexity of this method is O(m^n). =Pointer-based= Each node would have an internal array for storing pointers to each of its m children: Pointer-based implementation of m-ary tree where m=4. Compared to array-based implementation, this implementation method has superior space complexity of O(m\\\\cdot n). Enumeration of m-ary trees Listing all possible m-ary trees are useful in many disciplines as a way of checking hypothesis or theories. Proper representation of m-ary tree objects can greatly simplify the generation process. One can construct a bit sequence representation using the depth-first search of a m-ary tree with n nodes indicating the presence of a node at a given index using binary values. For example, the bit sequence x=1110000100010001000 is representing a 3-ary tree with n=6 nodes as shown below. 3-ary tree with bit sequence of 1110000100010001000 and Simple Zero Sequence of 004433 The problem with this representation is that listing all bit strings in lexicographic order would mean two successive strings might represent two trees that are lexicographically very different. Therefore, enumeration over binary strings would not necessarily result in an ordered generation of all m-ary trees. A better representation is based on an integer string that indicates the number of zeroes between successive ones, known as Simple Zero Sequence. S= s_1, s_2, \\\\dots , s_{n-1} is a Simple Zero Sequence corresponding to the bit sequence 10^{s_1}10^{s_2}\\\\ldots 10^{s_{n-1}}10^j where j is the number of zeroes needed at the tail end of the sequence to make the string have the appropriate length. For example, 1110000100010001000 \\\\equiv 10^0 10^0 10^4 10^4 10^3 \\\\equiv 00433 is the simple zero sequence representation of the above figure. A more compact representation of 00433 is 0^2 4^1 3^2, which is called zero sequence, which duplicate bases cannot be adjacent. This new representation allows to construct a next valid sequence in O(1). A simple zero sequence is valid if \\\\sum_{i=1}^{i=j} s_i \\\\le (m-1)j \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\forall j \\\\le n-1. , that is to say that number of zeros in the bit sequence of a m-ary tree cannot exceed the total number of null pointers (i.e., pointers without any child node attached to them). This summation is putting restriction on n-1 nodes so that there is room for adding the n^th without creating an invalid stracture (i.e. having an available null pointer to attached the last node to it). The table below shows the list of all valid simple zero sequences of all 3-ary trees with 4 nodes: center Starting from the bottom right of the table (i.e., \\"000\\"), there is a backbone template that governs the generation of the possible ordered trees starting from \\"000\\" to \\"006\\". The backbone template for this group (\\"00X\\") is depicted below, where an additional node is added in the positions labeled \\"x\\". center Once one has exhausted all possible positions in the backbone template, a new template will be constructed by shifting the 3rd node one position to the right as depicted below, and the same enumeration would occur until all possible positions labeled \\"X\\" is exhausted. center Going back to the table of enumeration of all m-ary trees, where m=3 and n=4, we can easily observe the apparent jump from \\"006\\" to \\"010\\" can be explained trivially in an algorithmic fashion as depicted below: center The pseudocode for this enumeration is given below: Procedure NEXT(s_1,s_2,\\\\dots,s_{n-1}) if s_i = 0 for all i then finished else i \\\\gets max\\\\\\\\{i  s_i > 0\\\\\\\\} s_i \\\\gets s_i - 1 if i s_i \\\\gets (i+1)\\\\cdot(m-1)-\\\\sum s_j end if for j \\\\gets i+2, i+3, \\\\dots, n-1 s_j \\\\gets k-1 end if end = Loopless enumeration = A generation algorithm that takes O(1) worst-case time are called loopless since the time complexity cannot involve a loop or recursion. Loopless enumeration of m-ary trees is said to be loopless if after initialization, it generates successive tree objects in O(1). For a given a m-ary tree T with a being one of its nodes and d its t^{th} child, a left-t rotation at a is done by making d the root node, and making b and all of its subtrees a child of a, additionally we assign the m-1 left most children of d to a and the right most child of d stays attached to it while d is promoted to root, as shown below: center Convert an m-ary tree to left-tree for i = 1 \\\\dots n : for t = 2 ... m: while t child of node at depth i e 1: L-t rotation at nodes at depth i end while end for end for A right-t rotation at d is the inverse of this operation. The left chain of T is a sequence of x_{1}, x_{2}, \\\\dots, x_{n} nodes such that x_1 is the root and all nodes except x_{n} have one child connected to their left most (i.e., m[1]) pointer. Any m-ary tree can be transformed to a left-chain tree using sequence of finite left-t rotations for t from 2 to m. Specifically, this can be done by performing left-t rotations on each node x_i until all of its m-1 sub-tree become null at each depth. Then, the sequence of number of left-t rotations performed at depth i denoted by c_i defines a codeword of a m-ary tree that can be recovered by performing the same sequence of right-t rotations. Let the m-1 tuple of c_1, c_2, \\\\dots ,c_{m-1} represent the number of L-2 rotations, L-3 rotations, ..., L-m rotations that has occurred at the root (i.e., i=1).Then, c_{(i-1)(m-1)+t-1} is the number of L-t rotations required at depth i. Capturing counts of left-rotations at each depth is a way of encoding an m-ary tree. Thus, enumerating all possible legal encoding would helps us to generate all the m-ary trees for a given m and n. But, not all c_i sequences of m non-negative integers represent a valid m-ary tree. A sequence of (n-1) \\\\dot (m-1) + 1 non-negative integers is a valid representation of a m-ary tree if and only if \\\\sum_{i=j}^{n} \\\\sum_{t=2}^{m} c_{(i-1)(m-1)+t-1} \\\\qquad \\\\le n-j \\\\qquad , \\\\forall j \\\\in 0 \\\\dots n. Lexicographically smallest code-word representation of a m-ary with n nodes is all zeros and the largest is n-1 ones followed by m-1 zero on its right. Initialization c[i] to zero for all i from 1 to n \\\\dot (k-1) p[i] set to n-1 for i from 1 to n sum \\\\gets 0 j \\\\gets m-1 Termination Condition Terminate when c[1] = n-1 Procedure NEXT sum \\\\gets sum + 1 - c[j+1] c[j] \\\\gets c[j]+1 if p[q[j > p[q[j+1 +1 then p[q[j \\\\gets p[q[j+1 +1 end if p[q[j+c[j ] \\\\gets p[q[j c[j+1] \\\\gets 0 if sum = p[q[j then j \\\\gets j-1 else p[n] \\\\gets sum j \\\\gets m-1 end if end Application One of the applications of m-ary tree is creating a dictionary for validation of acceptable strings. In order to do that, let m be equal to the number of valid alphabets (e.g., number of letters of the English alphabet) with the root of the tree representing the starting point. Similarly, each of the children can have up to m children representing the next possible character in the string. Thus, characters along the paths can represent valid keys by marking the end character of the keys as \\"terminal node\\". For example, in the example below \\"at\\" and \\"and\\" are valid key strings with \\"t\\" and \\"d\\" marked as terminal nodes. Terminal nodes can store extra information to be associated with a given key. There are similar ways to building such a dictionary using B-tree, Octree and/or trie. center See also * Branching factor * Left-child right-sibling binary tree * Binary tree References * External links * N-ary trees, Bruno R.

He has worked in the music business as a producer, talent manager and record executive. He has been involved in the careers of a variety of recording artists and performers throughout his career.  Life and career  Medina was born in East Los Angeles of Dominican parents into a poor family. The death of his mother and abandonment by his father resulted in him being placed into a number of foster homes, which he repeatedly ran away from before he and his siblings were taken in by his aunt. In his early teenage years Medina dealt joints and amphetamines. A critical event in his childhood was the befriendment of a wealthy white teenager, whose family in Beverly Hills allowed him to live in a refurbished garage behind their property. Medina then attended Beverly Hills High where he met Kerry Gordy and was a successful student. Medina's experiences of transferring to this wealthy environment is the loose basis for the 1990 Will Smith show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Medina started his career with the group Apollo, who released their self-titled debut on Gordy/Motown in 1979. Medina was the lead singer, other members included Kerry Gordy (keyboards), Cliff Liles (bass), Lenny Greene (drums) and Larry Robinson (guitar). Medina co-wrote three of the seven tracks, including “Astro Disco,” for which they are best known. The album was produced by Ray Singleton, former wife of Motown founder Berry Gordy. At age 24, Medina became the head of A&R; for Motown, working as a protégé to Berry Gordy. Under Gordy, Medina wrote and produced for legendary Motown acts such as The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, Billy Preston, Rick James and Teena Marie. Medina then moved on to Warner Bros. Records, where executive Mo Ostin tasked him to build and cultivate the careers of the company's urban artists as VP/GM of its urban-music division. While there, Medina collaborated with artists such as Ray Charles, Babyface, Prince, Chaka Khan, Madonna, Paul Simon and Fleetwood Mac. He also worked with Naughty by Nature, Queen Latifah, De La Soul, Biz Markie, Kool G. Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Roxanne Shanté, and Monie Love. After leaving Warner Bros., Medina and longtime friend Jeff Pollack formed Medina/Pollack Entertainment, which grew into a full service management and production company. They masterminded a variety of projects, including Booty Call, Above the Rim, and Maid in Manhattan. In early 2009, Benny Medina formed another company called the Medina Company.  Management clients  Medina is best known for managing actress/singer/dancer Jennifer Lopez. Along with Lopez and then-head of Sony Music, Tommy Mottola, Medina launched Lopez's pop music career in 1999, after which he and Lopez worked intensively together building a dominant film, music, fragrance and clothing empire. In 2003, at the height of her popularity, Lopez and Medina had a public falling out, and split. They remained in contact with each other, and unofficially reunited during late 2007. As of 2008, Medina officially resumed his role as Lopez's manager, and is also a godparent to her twin children. Other clients were also managed by Medina to lesser extents, including Tyra Banks, whom Medina helped to create a largely successful television and fashion career. Medina managed Sean \\"P. Diddy\\" Combs and aided in the launch of the Sean John apparel and fragrance empire. He has also managed singer Mariah Carey, one of the biggest stars in the world of Tommy Mottola (his close colleague while working with Lopez) before being let go in September 2008. Medina was also dismissed by actress/recording artist Brandy (fired him in 2004), and R&B; singer Usher (who fired him in 2008). Medina also managed singer-songwriter Vanessa Daou from 1996-1998 while the artist was signed to Krasnow Entertainment/MCA Records. When Daou chose to leave with label head Bob Krasnow and find a way out of her contractual obligations to MCA in 1998, Medina and his company Handprint Entertainmant, along with Daou, co-released the artist's internet- only album release 'Plutonium Glow'. Sexual assault allegations In November 2017, actor Jason Dottley accused Medina of attempting to rape him in December 2008. Dottley stated the event happened at Medina's Los Angeles mansion after Medina gave Dottley and fellow actor T. Ashanti Mozelle a tour of the home. Dottley stated in an interview with The Advocate that Anthony Rapp's recent sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey inspired him to come out with his \\"shameful secret.\\" Through his attorneys Howard Weitzman and Shawn Holley, Medina said in a statement, \\"Benny Medina categorically denies the allegation of attempted rape.\\" Personal life Medina is gay. In March 2007, he was ranked as one of Out.coms Top 50 Gays, coming in at spot 48.Oxfield, Jesse, Idov, Michael (4 March 2007), ‘Out’ Ranks the Top 50 Gays; Anderson Is No. 2 , New York Magqazine.

Early life and education Speer was born in Key West, Florida and graduated from Stetson University in Deland, Florida and from Stetson University College of Law in Gulfport, Florida. Career Speer left his job as an assistant state attorney two years after being hired in 1965.http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/home-shopping-pioneer-roy-speer- dies-at-80/1246908 Early in his legal career, Speer worked for the State of Florida in Tallahassee as a Special Assistant Attorney General. He also worked as Assistant Trial Staff Counsel for the U.S. Labor Relations Board. During this period, Speer developed a working relationship with A. Jay Cristol who is now Senior Federal Judge of the Southern Federal Bankruptcy Court. After leaving Tallahassee, he became a chief lobbyist for the City of St. Petersburg, specializing in water rights and laws. Later, Speer was appointed Assistant State Attorney for Pinellas County by Governor Haydon Burns. He then practiced law with John DeVito and Elizabeth A. Kovachevich, who is now a Senior Federal Judge. He dated Elizabeth A. Kovachevich in law school.http://tbo.com/news/business/hsn-co-founder-roy-speer-dies-at-age-- 470593 Speer established his first of many business partnerships with Estlon and JoAnn Pippin, experienced single-family homebuilders in Pasco County, Florida. They formed Tahitian Homes, Inc. and proceeded to build homes in western Pasco County. Later, Speer expanded his real estate development activities into a large multi-corporation company called Lanbanque, Inc. In order to supply utilities to his ever-expanding real estate projects, Speer and the Pippins established Aloha Utilities, Inc. which was the largest private water and sewer utility in Pasco County. During a slow-down in the real estate business, Speer spent three years in Europe, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait formulating TACET (Technology and Capital Exchange Trust). Speer was also involved in growing vegetables in Puerto Rico; he owned a beautician school, restaurants, lounges, a marina, marine dredging, data processing services, multi-level marketing of vitamins and cosmetics, cement block manufacturing, country-western music publishing and recording studios, telecommunications companies, a high-end boutique shop, general insurance agency, internet connection and data center, a walk-in medical clinic, wholesale gasoline and diesel fuel distribution operation, a travel agency, home security monitoring, mail order medical and diabetic supply company, a Big & Tall men's clothing store, an AM radio station, a mobile medical screening company, a book publishing company, a warehouse fulfillment and distribution company, an advertising media consulting firm, television stations, mobile home parks, a 225 room hotel in Nassau, Bahamas, a 500,000 square foot commercial warehouse complex in Las Vegas, and a five-star 23 story resort hotel and residences on Ft. Lauderdale Beach. In early 1980, Speer formed U.S. Hydrocarbons Drilling and Development, Inc., and oil and gas drilling exploration operation in southeastern Texas. Within a few years the world market price of oil decreased drastically causing the business to fail. There were numerous Texas banks supported by Speer's personal guarantee. The banks forced him into bankruptcy. Over the next four years Speer successfully emerged from bankruptcy with all unpaid claims fully satisfied. Speer founded the Roy M. Speer Foundation in 1986. The foundation has donated to the Dr. Parker Mahan Facial Pain Center at the University of Florida College of Dentistry, Pasco County YMCA Family Center, The Florida Orchestra, Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Presidential Prayer Team, Hurricane Relief Fund, New Port Richey's Super Playground, Billy Graham Crusade, and local Christian churches. =Home Shopping Network= During this tumultuous and intense period of significant litigation when most other business men would have become extremely wary of risky speculations, Speer forged ahead. In 1982, he and Bud Paxson formed Home Shopping Network to sell merchandise on television using a local cable network. This developed as an offshoot of an AM radio program. This became an ideal platform for Speer to apply his years of legal and business expertise. The effort created a completely new industry - retail merchandising through television. When the local venture expanded dramatically, they acquired access on a satellite channel in 1985, enabling the company to sell merchandise throughout the United States from the Clearwater facility. On May 13, 1986, Home Shopping Network went public on the American Stock Exchange. Within five years, the company would achieve over one billion dollars in annual net sales, a testament to Speer's vision and leadership. The success of this venture was so impressive that the Harvard M.B.A. Program assigned its students to analyze and critique the company's success. In 1993, Speer was charged in a class-action suit that alleged he improperly accepted compensation from vendors; that the Company paid Nando DiFilippo, former executive vice-president, general counsel and secretary of the Company, to prevent him from disclosing such vendor bribes; and that the Company had failed to properly disclose certain related party transactions in its filings with the SEC. Also in 1993, another suit was brought against Speer alleging a breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Company and its stockholders by failure to exercise due care and diligence in the management and administration of the affairs of the Company. The suit challenged the validity of a license agreement with Richard Speer (Roy Speer's son) pursuant to which the Company was given the exclusive rights to certain software and alleges that the Company wrongfully made payments to Richard Speer pursuant to a computer services agreement which was allegedly terminated. The suit alleged that the Company wrongfully made payments to Richard Speer of $3,502,000, $3,286,000 and $3,084,000 during the Company's 1992, 1991 and 1990 fiscal years, respectively, pursuant to the agreement. Merchandise that is unsuitable for sale via the Company's programs or outlet stores was sold by Richard Speer, who received a commission of 15% on the amount realized upon disposition. Richard Speer received $1,469,000, $1,615,000 and $1,427,000 and through this arrangement during the Company's 1992, 1991 and 1990 fiscal years, respectively. The suit also alleged that this 15% commission was commercially unreasonable. The suit alleged that the above-described arrangements would not have been entered into by the Company with an unrelated third party and that Roy and Richard Speer owned undisclosed interests in unspecified firms which sell merchandise to the Company. Speer settled all claims with the Plaintiffs before they ever went to trial.HOME SHOPPING NETWORK INC Form:10-K Filing Date:3/29/1994 He resigned from the Home Shopping Network in 1993.HighBeamhttp://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-04-08/business/9404081039_1_alan- gerson-executives-wandler Personal life Speer married Lynnda Short on July 22, 1960 at Calvary Baptist Church in Clearwater, Florida.

It is considered one of the most influential skate videos, as director Spike Jonze's format is frequently cited as its definitive filming template. Video Days is the first movie/video directed by Spike Jonze and stars Mark Gonzales, Rudy Johnson, Jason Lee, Guy Mariano and Jordan Richter. Legendary professional skateboarder Danny Way was briefly on Blind Skateboards from 1990–1991 and shot some footage for Video Days. However, he soon quit Blind, returning to his original team H-Street Skateboards and his footage for Video Days was omitted. A brief shot of Way can be seen during Mark Gonzales' part in this video. Synopsis The film starts off with footage of all 5 skaters driving around in a Blue Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency accompanied to the song \\"Low Rider\\" by War; this car becomes the central theme for the video. Each skater's name is introduced while riding in the car which is then followed by footage of them performing a trick. The car then drives along a road until out of frame which then reveals a sunset overlooking a forest. Guy Mariano's name is displayed in white writing in front of a black background thus beginning his part. Then footage of Guy performing several tricks is shown before the accompanied song (\\"I Want You Back\\" by Jackson 5) starts playing. Guy Mariano continues to primarily skate in places such as schools, car parks and streets. His part ends with him sliding a rail and being in disbelief about it. Jordan Richter's name is then displayed while the accompanying song (\\"My War\\" by Black Flag) starts playing. Jordan then proceeds to skate primarily half-pipes and vert-based skateparks (with some footage of him skating in car parks). His part ends abruptly after he performs a no handed air and the song ends. Mark Gonzales' name is then displayed; then footage of the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is shown with Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) saying \\"We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams\\". The accompanying song (\\"Traneing In\\" by John Coltrane) starts playing. Mark then proceeds to skate a wide variety of locations including car parks, streets, ditches, basketball courts, half pipes and plazas. Short and silent snippets of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory do appear throughout this part. The part ends when Mark frontside boardslides a rail and then loses his board. Then footage of a young British girl saying \\"I hope you've enjoyed the skateboarding and everything else, that's all folks, goodbye. And this is from...\\", she then gives a confused look to someone off camera. Then footage is shown of all five skaters riding in the Blue Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency interacting with various \\"Support our troops\\" protesters on the sidewalk. Jason Lee yells to the protesters the infamous line \\"No War for Heavy Metal!\\". Rudy Johnson's name is displayed while the accompanying song (\\"Just Like Heaven\\" by Dinosaur Jr.) starts playing. Rudy then skates such locations as streets, car parks, plazas and Embarcadero (in San Francisco). Rudy's part ends abruptly as he performs an Ollie one foot to lipslide on a rail and almost runs into the camera. Jason Lee's name is displayed before he addresses the camera and says \\"You know I'll give you a hundred bucks and I'll take you out to Benihana's if you slide that 75 foot handrail\\". He then pulls a face at the camera and says \\"I'll give you 600 tries, I'll be back next week\\". Then he proceeds to skate when the accompanying song (\\"The Knife Song\\" by Milk) comes on. He skates various car parks, plazas, streets, schools etc. in his part. About 3/4 of the way through his part the song changes to \\"Real World\\" by Hüsker Dü. Then a newspaper reading \\"AMERICA GOES TO WAR: COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE GULF CRISIS\\" is shown, then Jason Lee proceeds to sing a song that goes: : \\"There's a war outside of your window : It's destroying our world : So take the hand of a boy and a girl : And walk down the street and sing a happy song to make the make the world better : Peace on Earth : Environment : Religion and pray to God\\" His part then fades to black. Then a voice is heard which says \\"There's a liquor right there, dude, so pull over, it's a yellow sign\\". Then \\"Lowrider\\" by War is played again as several shots of all 5 skaters drinking alcoholic beverages while riding in their signature Blue Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency. The car then drives onto a narrow dirt road where it slowly starts to lose control. The car then falls off the dirt road and rolls down a big hill where it then crashes into a pile of rocks. The credits then roll, with each skater performing a trick in slow motion, with \\"Cancion mixteca\\" by Ry Cooder playing and with \\"(birthdate-1991)\\" under the name of each skater (except for Rudy Johnson which the number 1-900-810-3611 is displayed). Reception Video Days has had a positive feedback from critics and is considered an important part in skateboarding history and culture. Trashfilter.com has praised Video Days stating that \\" 'The best skate video of all time? Really?' When you take into a number of factors into account, then you soon realise that it's a deserving title. The story behind the first video from the Blind skateboard team back in 1991 is a much-fabled tale. But strip everything back to the raw skating within and it still holds its legendary status\\". Thrasher has inducted 3 out of the 5 skateboarding parts (Jason Lee, Mark Gonzales and Guy Mariano) in Video Days into their \\"classics\\" video section. Thrasher has praised Video Days saying \\"The Blind guys didn't set out to make skate history in 1991, and that makes this video's legendary status even better.\\" Huck writer Jay Riggio both praised and described his history with Video Days stating \\"The video was almost too much to take in. From the mind-blowing skating to the documented personalities of my heroes, absorbing it in small intervals was my only option. I can’t go as far as to say that I recognized the genius of Video Days off the bat, nor can I say that I even placed much importance on Spike Jonze’s onscreen credit back then – I had only recognized his name from photo credits in skate mags. All I knew was that Video Days made me want to skate like never before. There was magic in it that to this day seems difficult to place.\\" SkimTheFat reviewer \\"Thrashathon\\" rated Video Days 5 stars (out of stars) stating \\"Video Days has become a standard for skate videos for the last 10 years and will continue for the next 10. The street skating is amazing and still fires me up to this day. It features some of the all-time best skaters, and skating that is excellent even when compared with today's standards. Throughout the 360 flips, handrails, gaps, manual variations, and bluntslides, the eclectic soundtrack fully complements the video. I would highly recommend watching this video over all other videos.\\" Jason Lee's impromptu song at the end of his part caught the attention of Clerks director Kevin Smith, who would later cast Lee in Smith's follow-up film Mallrats, thus launching Lee's acting career. Although the car crash at the end was not intended to be serious, at the time, many people thought the team had actually died.. In popular culture * Video Days is shown playing in the background during a scene in the controversial 1995 film, Kids. * As part of Thrasher Magazine's King of the Road 2011, Team Dekline were issued a challenge in Los Angeles stating \\"Skate This Spot from Video Days\\" (Jason Lee and Rudy Johnson can be seen skating this spot in Video Days). * During Jason Lee's opening monologue in Season 31, Episode 5 of Saturday Night Live he explains to the audience that he was a professional skateboarder before he became an actor; subsequently footage of his part in Video Days was shown. 20th Anniversary Reunion For their February/March 2011 issue, Skateboarder Magazine organized a reunion photo shoot with all 5 skaters to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Video Days. Skateboarder Magazine's photographer John Bradford quoted on skateboardermag.com \\"To tell you the truth I was a little jealous of Jaime Owens when he told me he’d be shooting the Video Days guys for the article. He’s usually the one holding everything together down in the office while photographers like me and Mehring are out and about shooting what needs to be shot. Plus, I’m of an age where I grew up in the ’90′s (like Jaime), and can vividly remember the earth figuratively shaking when Video Days first dropped. I have a 2 decade old nervous tick of starting to whistle the John Coltrane song from Gonz’ part, which often reminds me of how many times I watched it before and after school, and on the weekends before I went skating… so I of course started drooling over the shoot when I first heard it was coming together. Anyway I digress. As the shoot happened I tagged along to be a fly on the wall (and to help out where I could) while these dudes all got together for the first time in many years to reminisce about how they innocently and unwhittingly (sic) changed skateboarding forever. My jealousy of Jaime instantly faded and the day became one of my favorite days of my career to date, just given who was in the room and what they were all collectively there to celebrate.\\" A 3 part \\"Behind the Scenes\\" video series was then uploaded onto skateboardermag.com, one of which had an interview with Guy Mariano about the early days of Blind Skateboards and Video Days. Soundtrack The soundtrack includes many types of music, including rock, jazz, pop and punk.

He served in the French Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War and was one of the leaders of the Revolt in the Vendée against the revolutionary regime. His nephew Athanase-Charles- Marie Charette de la Contrie was a noted military leader and grandson of Charles X the last king of France. Life =Early activities= A nobleman born in Couffé, arrondissement of Ancenis, Charette served in the French Navy under Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte, notably during the American War of Independence, and became lieutenant de vaisseau. He notably served on the 74-gun Hercule, under Puget-Bras. Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, he quit the Navy in 1789 and emigrated to Koblenz (Trier) in 1792 (a common move for royalist aristocrats). He soon returned to France to live at his property in La Garnache, and became one of the royalist volunteers who assisted in defending King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from physical harm during the mob attack on Tuileries Palace (the Journée du 10 août); arrested in Angers, he was released through the intervention of Charles François Dumouriez. =Vendée War= In 1793, the Revolt in the Vendée against the French First Republic broke out, and the peasant fighters asked Charette to be their leader. He joined Jacques Cathelineau following the taking of Saumur in June 1793 and fought in most of the battles of the Catholic and Royal Army. On 19 September 1793, he participated in the victorious Battle of Tiffauges. Afterwards he and Louis Marie de Lescure had marched on Saint-Fulgent to pursue Jean-Baptiste Kléber, who had escaped. Charette won another victory over the Republicans at the First Battle of Noirmoutier. Some of the captured soldiers took part in the Machecoul Massacres and a quarter of them were executed for retribution by Charette's troops, against his orders. After the parting of the Vendean leaders in September 1793, he and his men retreated. He became the leader of the Lower Vendée, and successfully used guerrilla warfare against the Republican troops, capturing a Republican camp in Saint- Christophe-du-Ligneron, near Challans, but ran out of supplies and was decisively attacked by the troops of Nicolas Haxo. Trapped in the , Charette, with the fellow leader Couëtus was informed of an escape route by a local to the isle. Leaving behind all guns, ammunition, horses, refugees and the wounded, Charette, Couëtus and their men swam through the marshes to Châteauneuf. By a chance stroke of luck, Charette met up with the army of Joly, and both he and Charette retaliated by circling Haxo, gaining back supplies and distracting the Republican army from the refugees.Fighting the French Revolution by Rob Harper, pgs. 220-225 Haxo later attacked the Isle of Noirmoutier, with Louis Turreau, which had been taken by Charette the month before, and after promising life to the inhabitants if they surrendered, against Haxo's command Turreau killed most men, women and children on the isle at the steps of the local church (La chapelle de la Pitié), including D'Elbée who had taken refuge there after sustaining 14 wounds at the battle of Cholet. After this, Charette's army returned and collected reinforcements; Revolutionary brutality and the 'Infernal Columns' sent by the Convention to destroy the Vendée forced many peasants to join Charette's army for merely safety.Fighting the French Revolution, Rob Harper, pgs. 291-296 Charette won a victory at Saint-Fulgent, only to be chased into hiding in the forest of Grala.La Vendée historique, pgs. 413-414 He emerged from it to attack the 'Brouzils'; he was wounded in the arm but kept on until the end of the fight. After obtaining food for his starving army, Charette was brought to La Morière, a convent near Machecoul, to recover from his wound; he was only able to rest there for a few days when his location was betrayed and the Republicans surrounded the convent. Warned, he was able to escape, but the nuns and a large number of the refugees who had come with Charette's army and had hidden in the church were massacred. The Capture of Charette, by Louis Joseph Watteau, 1796 =Defeat= Execution of General Charette, in Nantes, March 1796, by Julien Le Blant On 17 February 1795, after being introduced to it by his sister, Charette signed the Treaty of La Jaunaye with the emissaries of the National Convention, which included freedom of religion guarantees and excluded the conscription of local peasants from the levée en masse. The republicans soon reneged on the terms of the treaty, and their parole, repudiating the guarantees of religious freedom; and they began conscripting peasants once again. They also murdered thousands of royalist prisoners including the Bishop of Dol. Charette and his men returned to the fight again in July and moved to help the planned invasion at Quiberon by French royalist emigrés with assistance from the British Royal Navy. The Count of Artois, the Bourbon successor to the throne of France, made him Lieutenant General and gave orders to prepare for a royal return which, however, did not eventuate. Charette remained loyal to the old dynasty and the Catholic religion, as did his men and most of the Vendean and Breton peasantry. He, and all the loyal royalists, later refused to join the liberal Orléanists. After the failure of the Quiberon expedition, Charette and his men were pursued by General Lazare Hoche. Charette was wounded but escaped. However, due to lack of munitions he was eventually captured outside La Chabotterie and taken to Nantes for a trial. He was sentenced to death by a republican court and then taken to the town square in procession for a public execution by firing squad.George J. Hill, The Story of the War in La Vendée and the Little Chouannerie (New York: D. & J. Sadlier & Co. n.d.), pp. 222-227. A plaque has been erected and still stands upon the place where he was shot. Today, memorial ceremonies continue to take place there. According to a contemporary writing in Walker's Hibernian Magazine, it was Charette who said, by way of extenuating the number of deaths for which he was responsible, \\"Omelets are not made without breaking eggs.\\"\\"Some particulars respecting the Capture and Death of Charette, the famous Royalist General of La Vendée; with sketches of his character.\\" Walker's Hibernian Magazine, 1796, p. 410. Charette was described by Napoleon as a great character and military leader who \\"betrays genius\\".Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases, The Memorial of Saint Helena, Volume VII, p. 237 Depictions in films and popular culture Death mask of François de Charette Charette is a character in the episode \\"The Frogs and the Lobsters\\" of the Hornblower film/television series. Charette is a royalist general in exile who, with the support of the British Royal Navy, attempts and fails to rally the surviving royalists and raise an army in France to restore the king to power. Unlike his real-life counterpart here he is slain in battle defending a captured fortification. He is also fluent in English in the television adaptation. Charette has been since 2018 the lead character and his life story is depicted in the production of Le Dernier Panache (“The Last Plume”), at the French theme park, Puy Du Fou.

The Cowpasture River is a chief tributary of the James River in western Virginia in the United States. It is long.U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 Course The Cowpasture rises in northeastern Highland County and flows generally southwestwardly, initially between Bullpasture Mountain and Shaws Ridge through a narrow valley floor near the George Washington National Forest. It is joined in eastern Highland County by Shaws Fork and gains breadth but has little depth. At Summers Mountain (a high point along Bullpasture Mountain) the river passes through a narrow gorge before entering a broad valley in Bath County, where at the community of Williamsville it collects the Bullpasture River, which greatly adds to its volume. For from this confluence the Cowpasture is joined by many small streams, and flows in increasingly wide bends in eastern Bath County. Downstream of the community of Millboro Springs the river becomes deep enough for year-round boating; there are several boat launch sites along the river in Bath County. In eastern Alleghany County the Cowpasture is joined by Simpson Creek and shortly enters Botetourt County, where it joins the Jackson River to form the James River near the town of Iron Gate. History The Native Americans had named the river Walatoola, which means \\"winding waters\\", describing the great bends in the river. However, when British settlers arrived in the 1720s they named it the Cowpasture. There is an interesting story about how the Cowpasture and neighboring rivers the Bullpasture River and Calfpasture River came to be so named. It is said that the Shawnee once had stolen a herd of settlers' cattle and were driving them westward into the mountains. The calves naturally tired first; they were left behind at the river which is now the Calfpasture. The cows were driven on farther, but they, too, had to be abandoned, the valley in which they were left became the valley of the Cowpasture. The bulls, being somewhat hardier, were still able to continue westward; they finally were left at the river which is known as the Bullpasture. Topography The Cowpasture flows through valley and ridge topography of shale, limestone, and sandstone. Because of the limestone there are a great number of sinkholes and caves. During extended dry periods the upper courses of the river will entirely dry up and only flow beneath the river bed through the limestone caves. Wildlife Because the Cowpasture is bordered by George Washington National Forest, Highland Wildlife Management Area, and several Wilderness Areas, there is an abundance of wildlife. There are many bald eagles which nest along the river, and there are also river otters, which have been reintroduced. With the abundance of wildlife there are also many hunt camps along the river.

It is a continuation of the Shining series. Comprising three separate but overlapping storylines, Shining Force III was released in three volumes. Camelot Soft also issued a Premium Disc featuring artwork, a character model viewer, and additional battles as a giveaway for players who sent in proof of purchase for all three volumes. In North America and Europe, only the first volume was released. Gameplay Like earlier Force games in the Shining series, Shining Force III is a turn- based tactical role-playing game. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, do not count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed. As is typical for an RPG, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Each character has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A character can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level. Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader (Synbios in Scenario 1, Prince Medion in Scenario 2 and Julian in Scenario 3), or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Return. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although the leader's death results in the player losing half of their money. Shining Force III also possesses an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by its leader, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle. Plot Scenario 1 features Synbios, a young lord from the Republic of Aspinia. Aspinia was once a part of the Empire of Destonia, but seceded after a war of independence spearheaded by some of the more democratic-minded nobles. They opposed Emperor Domaric's totalitarian policies, which disenfranchised a large number of people, creating a huge disparity between the wealthy and the poor. Tensions remained between Aspinia and Destonia after the secession, marked by occasional border disputes. As the game begins, Synbios is part of a military force representing Aspinia at a peace conference in the neutral city of Saraband. Due to manipulation by outside forces - later discovered to be connected with a religious cult known as the \\"Bulzome Sect\\" - full-scale war breaks out again between Aspinia and Destonia. The majority of the game's storyline covers this conflict as well as Synbios and his team's fight against the Bulzome sect. Throughout the game Synbios has periodic encounters with Medion, Destonia's youngest prince, who also recognizes the truth behind the war. Although on opposite sides of the war, the two work together to identify the real threat. Medion's role is portrayed in more detail in Scenario 2. Scenario 2 features Medion, Prince of Destonia, and youngest of three sons of Emperor Domaric. Although loyal to his father and his country, he senses that there are other forces at work beneath the tensions between Aspinia and Destonia. He attends the conference in Saraband on behalf of Destonia, along with his brothers Arrawnt and Mageron. As discovered in Scenario 1, much of this influence comes from the Bulzome sect, as well as collaborating separatist factions within both Destonia and Aspinia. Medion works parallel to Synbios of Aspinia, often disposing of rogue Aspinian elements to spare Synbios's force from fighting against its own countrymen. At the end of the game, Medion is forced to battle with Synbios' force when Julian steps in to stop them. Scenario 3 stars Julian, a mercenary who appears as a secondary character in both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father. Julian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny. Scenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 & 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some \\"overlap\\". Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict. Development The game was announced in September 1997. Reception Next Generation reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"it's a worthy upgrade to a game series that's already proven itself.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Like Saturn itself, Shining Force III will end up being an effort that was underproduced, underrated, but fun as hell.\\" References External links *Official site of Camelot Software Planning (Japanese) Category:Role-playing video games Category:Camelot Software Planning games Category:Episodic video games Category:Sega video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Sega Saturn-only games Category:Shining (series) Category:Strategy video games Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:1997 video games Category:Video games scored by Motoi Sakuraba ","title":"Shining Force III"},{"id":"2145344","text":"Manorbier Castle () is a Norman castle in Manorbier, southwest of Tenby, Wales. It was founded in the late 11th century by the Anglo-Norman de Barry family. The castle was part of a mesne lordship under the control of the medieval Earls of Pembroke. Construction Manorbier is a rectangular enclosure castle that has curtain walls and round and square towers. It stands on a natural coastal promontory and has no external moat. The main entrance to the inner ward is a tower gateway that was defended by a portcullis, roof embrasures and a heavy iron/wood door. A postern gate provided access to the beach and the sea. The southeast tower is round; the northeast is angular. The castle's domestic ranges, which were completed in the 1140s, included kitchens, apartments and a Great hall. Windows replaced the arrowslits in the domestic range. A chapel with elaborate vaulting and plaster-work was built . Some of the original medieval frescoes survive. Earthworks completed an outer ward. There was no barbican. A bridge across a neck ditch linked the inner and outer wards.  History  The land was granted to Odo de Barri, a Norman knight, at the end of the 11th century. Initially, he constructed a motte-and- bailey castle on the site which had a wooden keep defended by a palisade and earthworks embankments. In the early part of the 12th century, William de Barri, Odo's son, used locally-quarried Limestone to strengthen the fortification. In 1146 Gerald of Wales, the great 12th-century scholar known as Geraldus Cambrensis was born at the castle. He was the fourth and youngest son of William de Barri, who was related on his mother's side, to the legendary Welsh princess Nest ferch Rhys. Gerald wrote of his birthplace: > In all the broad lands of Wales, Manorbier is the most pleasant place by > far. In the castle's history, it was only attacked twice; both were minor skirmishes. In 1327, Richard de Barri assaulted Manorbier in a dispute over family succession. Then 300 years later during the English Civil War, the castle was seized in 1645 by Parliamentarian forces. It was then slighted to prevent further military use by the Royalists. Through the 17th and 18th centuries, Manorbier fell into decay. However, in 1880 the castle was partially restored by J.R.Cobb, a tenant who carried out repairs to the buildings and walls. Present day Viewed from the northeast The castle is privately owned and is open to the public together with the gardens, the dovecote and the mill. The castle is a wedding venue. A part has been converted into a holiday cottage.

The software is used to view either live or recorded statistics covering metrics such as CPU load averages or network utilization for many nodes. Ganglia software is bundled with enterprise-level Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Level (RHEL) or the CentOS repackaging of the same. Ganglia grew out of requirements for monitoring systems by Berkeley (University of California) but now sees use by commercial and educational organisations such as Cray, MIT, NASA and Twitter. Ganglia It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It relies on a multicast-based listen/announce protocol to monitor state within clusters and uses a tree of point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to federate clusters and aggregate their state. It leverages widely used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on over 500 clusters around the world. It has been used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.Ganglia Monitoring System The ganglia system comprises two unique daemons, a PHP-based web front-end, and a few other small utility programs. = Ganglia Monitoring Daemon (gmond) = Gmond is a multi-threaded daemon which runs on each cluster node you want to monitor. Installation does not require having a common NFS filesystem or a database back-end, installing special accounts or maintaining configuration files. Gmond has four main responsibilities: # Monitor changes in host state. # Announce relevant changes. # Listen to the state of all other ganglia nodes via a unicast or multicast channel. # Answer requests for an XML description of the cluster state. Each gmond transmits information in two different ways: * Unicasting or Multicasting host state in external data representation (XDR) format using UDP messages. * Sending XML over a TCP connection. =Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad)= Federation in Ganglia is achieved using a tree of point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to aggregate the state of multiple clusters. At each node in the tree, a Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad) periodically polls a collection of child data sources, parses the collected XML, saves all numeric, volatile metrics to round-robin databases and exports the aggregated XML over a TCP socket to clients. Data sources may be either gmond daemons, representing specific clusters, or other gmetad daemons, representing sets of clusters. Data sources use source IP addresses for access control and can be specified using multiple IP addresses for failover. The latter capability is natural for aggregating data from clusters since each gmond daemon contains the entire state of its cluster. =Ganglia PHP Web Front-end= The Ganglia web front-end provides a view of the gathered information via real-time dynamic web pages. Most importantly, it displays Ganglia data in a meaningful way for system administrators and computer users. Although the web front-end to ganglia started as a simple HTML view of the XML tree, it has evolved into a system that keeps a colorful history of all collected data. The Ganglia web front-end caters to system administrators and users. For example, one can view the CPU utilization over the past hour, day, week, month, or year. The web front-end shows similar graphs for memory usage, disk usage, network statistics, number of running processes, and all other Ganglia metrics. The web front-end depends on the existence of the gmetad which provides it with data from several Ganglia sources. Specifically, the web front-end will open the local port 8651 (by default) and expects to receive a Ganglia XML tree. The web pages themselves are highly dynamic; any change to the Ganglia data appears immediately on the site. This behavior leads to a very responsive site, but requires that the full XML tree be parsed on every page access. Therefore, the Ganglia web front-end should run on a fairly powerful, dedicated machine if it presents a large amount of data. The Ganglia web front-end is written in PHP, and uses graphs generated by gmetad to display history information. It has been tested on many flavours of Unix (primarily Linux) with the Apache webserver and the PHP5 module.

The Bull Lake glaciation began about 200,000 years ago and ended about 130,000 years ago, and was concurrent with the Illinoian Stage of the Quaternary Ice Age.Fullerton, David S.; Colton, Roger B.; and Bush, Charles A. \\"Limits of Mountain and Continental Glaciations in Northern Montana and North-Western North Dakota, U.S.A.\\" In Quaternary Glaciations: Extent and Chronology. Part II: North America. Jim Rose, ed. San Diego, Calif.: Elsevier, 2004. There is disagreement over these time frames, however, and further research is necessary. This glacial period was identified by geologist Eliot Blackwelder.Kelsey, Joe. Climbing and Hiking in the Wind River Mountains. Evergreen, Colo.: Chockstone Press, 1994; Balckwelder, Eliot. \\"Post-Cretaceous History of the Mountains of Central Western Wyoming.\\" Journal of Geology. 23 (1915): 214-15. The glacial period draws its name from Bull Lake in Wyoming in the United States, where well-preserved moraines from this glacial period were first described. Although Blackwelder originally believed the Bull Lake glaciation occurred during the early Wisconsin Glaciation (the last major advance of glaciers in the North America), new data generated and described by geologist Gerald M. Richmond in the 1940s and 1960s more accurately dated the glacial period to the Illinoian Stage.Richmond, Gerald M. Geology of the Northwest End of the Wind River Mountains, Sublette County, Wyoming.

The Bull Lake glaciation was a local glaciation. It did not cover the entire North American continent but rather just the eastern slopes of the southern Rocky Mountains. Generally speaking, it extended from northwestern Montana south to the San Juan Mountains in Colorado.Pierce, Kenneth L. \\"Pleistocene Glaciations of the Rocky Mountains.\\" Development in Quaternary Science. 1 (2003). The Bull Lake glaciation has three periods—Early, Middle and Late—punctuated by periods of relative warmth (during which glaciers retreated).Elias, Scott.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1996; Richmond, Gerald M. \\"Appraisal of the Future Climate of the Holocene in the Rocky Mountains.\\" Quaternary Research. 2:3 (November 1972): 315-322. The Bull Lake glaciation is generally considered to be much less extensive than the preceding glaciations. However, the reach of the glaciers varied from place to place, extending further in some areas than others. Bull Lake moraines remain relatively undisturbed, indicating that glacial periods which came later were only about 90 percent as extensive as the Bull Lake glaciation. The Bull Lake Glaciation was followed by a warm interglacial period that lasted about 60,000 years. The Pinedale Glaciation, another local glacial period, occurred after this warm period.

After being canceled, the U.S. Air Force selected the J52 to power the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. The engine was designed with several unique features for this application, including a \\"conical centerbody mounted in the intake\\" and a \\"variable central plug ... in the nozzle\\".Quotations from Flight, 1961, Then, in 1958, the US Navy selected the engine to power what became the A-6 Intruder. The J52-P-6 model, designed for the YA2F-1 (YA-6A) Intruder, had a unique nozzle that could be angled downward at 23 degrees for STOL takeoffs; this was not used on production A-6s.

Operational history B-52F takeoff with J52-powered AGM-28 Hound Dog missiles In 1960, U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC) developed procedures so that the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress could use the Hound Dog's J52 engine for additional thrust while the missile was located on the bomber's two pylons. This helped heavily laden B-52s fly away from their airbases faster, which would have been useful in case of nuclear attacks on the bases.

Life Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 16, 1852, Soden was educated at the University of Tübingen. In 1881 he was appointed as the minister at Dresden-Striesen and in 1887 he became minister of the Jerusalem Church in Berlin. In 1889 he also became a privatdozent, a form of tutor, in the University of Berlin, and four years later was appointed as an extraordinary professor of divinity. He fought for a more presbyterian and democratic constitution in the congregations of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. II of the congregations of the Jerusalem's Church and the New Church) in Berlin- Kreuzberg, south of the Hallesches Tor. Soden introduced a new notation of manuscripts and also developed a new theory of textual history. He believed that in the 4th century there were in existence three recensions of the text of the New Testament, which he distinguished as K, H and I. After establishing the text of I, H and K, Soden reconstructed a hypothetical text, I-H-K, which he believed to have been their ancestor. He then tried to show that this text was known to all the writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries Soden died in a railway accident in Berlin on January 15, 1914. His descendant Wolfram von Soden became a noted Assyriologist. Works His most important book is Die Schriften des neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt / hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte (4 vols., Berlin: Glaue, 1902-1910); certainly the most important work on the text of the New Testament which had been published since Westcott and Hort's The New Testament in the Original Greek.

The series ran for three seasons totaling 66 episodes. Season one was filmed in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; due to tax breaks the production was eligible for under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Season two was filmed in Eilat, Israel. Season three was filmed in Pretoria, South Africa, with some sequences shot in Mauritius. Plot The plot revolves around private investigator, Nick Slaughter, an ex-DEA agent, who after arriving in the fictional resort town of Key Mariah, Florida, and setting up a detective agency there, meets up with local tourist agent, Sylvie Girard, to solve a variety of different cases.

Rupert Series overview Popularity in Serbia Nick Slaughter portrayed in Serbian comic \\"Strip protest\\", by Aleksa Gajić, released during the 1996–97 students' protests against Slobodan Milošević's regime. The series was particularly popular in Serbia, where it gained cult status. In a tumultuous social environment – with a UN trade embargo imposed on the country and civil war raging nearby – Nick Slaughter's character became a tongue-in-cheek role model, particularly among urban youth, and eventually a symbol of opposition politics. During the 1990s, the series was broadcast on four Serbian television stations – TV Politika (1992–93), NS+ (1993–94), RTS 3K (1994–95), and RTV Pink (1996–97) – and rerun numerous times. Aside from its dry humor and exciting plot, the show was extremely well received because its idyllic tropical island atmosphere was an absolute contrast to mid-1990s Serbia. The reruns in the then-isolated country made the show immensely popular, turning it into a minor national cultural phenomenon. The notion of Nick Slaughter being a widely received hero in Serbia probably began in the Belgrade suburb of Žarkovo where, now-legendary, graffiti \\"Sloteru Niče, Žarkovo ti kliče\\" (\\"Nick Slaughter, Žarkovo hails you\\", which rhymes in Serbian) appeared. Soon afterward during the massive months-long protests throughout winter 1996–97 against the alleged election fraud perpetrated by Slobodan Milošević and his party at the November 1996 local elections, the slogan \\"Slotera Nika, za predsednika\\" (\\"Nick Slaughter for President\\", also rhymes in Serbian) became popular on banners and badges as a symbol of opposition to the regime. Another popular slogan was \\"Svakoj majci treba da je dika, koja ima sina k'o Slotera Nika\\" (\\"Every mother should be proud to have a son like Nick Slaughter\\"). Serbian punk band Atheist Rap paid a tribute to the series' protagonist in the song \\"Slaughteru Nietzsche\\" with its graffiti-based chorus \\"Sloteru Niče, Srbija ti kliče\\" (\\"Nick Slaughter, Serbia hails you\\") on their 1998 album II liga zapad. In 2008, Rob Stewart performed the song with the band on stage. A river restaurant named Tropical Heat (in Serbian: \\"Тропска врелина\\") on the beach along Sava river in Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia (summer 2009) Many local bars, taverns, and summer patios in Serbia were (re)named Tropical Heat in honour of Nick Slaughter and the popular TV show. They were usually located along the rivers, to resemble \\"The Key Mariah Spirit\\". Apparently, no one associated with the show was aware of its extraordinary popularity in Serbia until December 2008 when Canadian actor Rob Stewart who played Nick Slaughter in the series accidentally discovered it by stumbling upon a Facebook fan group named \\"Tropical Heat/Nick Slaughter\\" with some 17,000 (mostly Serbian) followers. After familiarizing himself with the cause and the circumstances of his Serbian fame, the mostly unemployed 48-year-old Stewart, along with a filmmaker friend Marc Vespi and his sister Liza, decided to attempt to make Slaughter Nick for President, a documentary about it. To that end, they contacted the band Atheist Rap and it was soon arranged for Rob to appear on stage as their guest at the To Be Punk Festival in Novi Sad on June 6. By late March 2009 the news was leaked to Serbian press and several media outlets carried items that Rob Stewart would be coming to Serbia in May or early June as guest of Atheist Rap in order to film a documentary on his character's popularity in the country during the 1990s. Stewart and his partners contacted Srđa Popović, former activist of Otpor!, the Serbian student movement that played a significant role in eventually bringing down Milošević. On June 3, 2009, Stewart arrived in Belgrade to a hero's welcome with enormous media attention afforded to his visit. With Atheist Rap and Popović as their hosts and guides through Serbia, and in between the documentary shooting schedule, Stewart made the media rounds, appearing on talk shows (Piramida and Fajront Republika), giving interviews, and making public appearances such as planting of the maple trees in Žarkovo with John Morrison, Canadian ambassador to Serbia. As a result of their June 2009 stay in Belgrade and Novi Sad, a six- minute documentary promo was put together and entered in the Roma Fiction Fest in Rome, Italy on July 8, 2009 under the \\"work in progress\\" section. Movie sequel Two episodes of the show were re-edited into a feature-length film, Criss Cross. IMDb states this received a release in 2001. Home media Tango Entertainment released the complete series on DVD on January 8, 2008 in a 9-disc set entitled Tropical Heat: Sweating Bullets Complete series.

It was about a mile in circumference and was flanked with towers.Universal geography:Volume 4 By Conrad Malte-Brun The town served as the base of the Roman Catholic missionaries to Ethiopia during the 16th and 17th centuries. Bernhard Lindahl identifies Fremona with the modern settlement of Endiet Nebersh, located 10 kilometers from Adwa.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 27 September 2007)  History  Fremona was originally called \\"Maigoga\\" (mai, Tigrinya \\"water,\\" and guagua, \\"noisy\\") because of the two rocky streams that ran through the community. The origin of the name is uncertain but it is very old, appearing on Aksumite inscriptions; it was not renamed by the Jesuit missionaries. It was there that bishop Andrés de Oviedo died and was buried in 1577, and his tomb became a shrine to the local Catholics. When the Jesuit Manuel de Almeida visited Fremona in 1624, he found that it had been improved with \\"seven or eight bastions with high curtain walls, two courtyards, one of which adjoins the houses, where a good stone tank has been made, and another were a beautiful church was now being built of stone and lime.\\" He adds that due to the rarity of firearms in Ethiopia at the time, \\"with twenty or thirty muskets, a small cannon and the sons of the Portuguese manning them, [it] was held in Ethiopia to be a unique and impregnable place.\\"Translated in C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford, Some Records of Ethiopia, 1593-1646 (London: Hakluyt Society, 1954), p. 186. It was here that the Catholic priests, patriarch and bishop were exiled, after Emperor Fasilides condemned Catholicism and restored to official status the traditional beliefs of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in 1634. At the time, Jerónimo Lobo states that the town had 400 inhabitants. After the Catholic missionaries were banished from Ethiopia, Fremona was eventually abandoned; the details are unknown. The Ethiopian historian Richard Pankhurst cites a taxation report from 1697 that mentions Fremona under its old name Maigoga.Richard K.P.

The butterfly, whose life cycle depends on the wild blue lupine flower (Lupinus perennis), was classified as an endangered species in the United States in 1992. This subspecies of Plebejus melissa was first identified and described by novelist Vladimir Nabokov. The name originates from Karner, New York (located half-way between Albany and Schenectady) in the Albany Pine Bush, where it was first discovered. In the novel Pnin, Nabokov describes a score of Karner blues without naming them. Lupine blooms in late May. There are two generations of Karner blues per year, the first in late May to mid June, the second from mid- July to mid-August. Local conservation efforts, concentrating on replanting large areas of blue lupine which have been lost to development (and to fire suppression, which destroys the open, sandy habitat required by blue lupine), are having modest success at encouraging the butterfly's repopulation. The Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin is home to the world's largest population of Karner blues, which benefit from its vast area of savanna and extensive lupine. In May 2000, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Karner blue as being locally extinct in Canada. In 2012, after an unusually hot and dry year, the Karner blue was extirpated in the Indiana Dunes National Park. Description The male and female of this small (wingspan of about one inch) butterfly are different in appearance. The topside of the male is silvery or dark blue with narrow black margins. The female is grayish brown, especially on the outer portions of the wings, to blue on the topside, with irregular bands of orange crescents inside the narrow black border. The underside of both sexes is gray with a continuous band of orange crescents along the edges of both wings and with scattered black spots circled with white. Distribution and habitat The Karner blue butterfly occurs in portions of eastern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. Reintroductions have been initiated in Ohio and New Hampshire. The Karner blue butterfly appears extirpated from Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maine, and Ontario. Although Karner blue butterflies are characteristic of oak savannas (Quercus spp.) and pine barrens (Pinus spp.) habitats, they also occur in frequently disturbed areas such as rights-of-way, old fields, and road margins. In east-central New York, Karner blue butterflies occurred in 3 rights-of-way habitat types: wild lily-of-the- valley-starflower (Maianthemum canadensis-Trientalis borealis), sweetfern- whorled yellow loosestrife (Comptonia peregrina-Lysimachia quadrifolia), and blackberry-sheep sorrel (Rubus spp. Rumex acetosella). An index of Karner blue population size was highest in the wild lily-of-the-valley-starflower type. In this habitat, mosses (Bryophyta, 6.9%), wild lily-of-the-valley (4.4%), grasses (Poaceae, 4.4%), and starflower (2.1%) had the highest cover. Coverage in the sweetfern-whorled yellow loosestrife type was dominated by grasses (40.9%), sweetfern (12.1%), mosses (9.4%), and whorled yellow loosestrife (5.2%). In the blackberry-sheep sorrel type, the dominants included grasses (22.7%), northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris, 5.0%), other blackberries (4.8%), and sheep sorrel (4.3%). =Wild lupine= Several studies have found a positive relationship between measures of wild lupine and Karner blue butterfly abundance. However, available evidence suggests that senescent wild lupine is a poor larval food source. The effects of other phenological stages are more ambiguous. In west-central Wisconsin, Karner blue butterfly abundance was negatively associated with the abundance of reproductive lupine and positively related with the frequency of immature wild lupine. However, a feeding trial found that Karner blue butterfly fed 1st year wild lupine had one of the lowest survival rates observed and significantly longer larval durations than larvae fed older wild lupine that did not flower, was flowering, had recently flowered, or was grown in shade and was in seed. In addition, on sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, the number of 1st flight oviposition sites on nonreproductive and reproductive wild lupine was similar. Many other factors may influence the quality of wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) as a Karner blue butterfly food resource. At Indiana Dunes National Park, wild lupine with Karner blue butterfly feeding damage had significantly larger leaves and longer and thicker stems than plants without feeding damage. In addition, larval length was positively associated with wild lupine height in central Wisconsin. Higher nitrogen concentrations in wild lupine leaves resulted in significantly shorter larval durations in a feeding trial. In 1995, in west-central Wisconsin, significantly more Karner blue butterfly larvae were observed in oak-pine barren plots where mildew infection was delayed compared to areas where wild lupine were infected earlier. However, in a feeding trial larval duration of Karner blue butterflies fed mildew-infected wild lupine was not significantly different from treatments that resulted in the shortest larval durations. Karner blue butterfly fed water-stressed wild lupine had significantly longer larval durations than many treatments including larvae fed flowering wild lupine, shade-grown wild lupine in seed, or mildew-infected wild lupine. Although Karner blue butterflies have been shown to benefit from their association with ants, wild lupine with Karner blue butterfly larvae in the Allegan State Game Area in Michigan were not detectably closer to ant hills than wild lupine without caterpillars. =Canopy cover= Due to effects of environmental variation and differing requirements among life stages, broods, and sexes, Karner blue butterflies require a mosaic of sun and shade.Lane, Cynthia P. (1999). Benefits of heterogeneous habitat: oviposition preference and immature performance of Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). St. Paul, MN: University of Minnesota, Dissertation Adult Karner blue butterflies' preference for open, sunny areas has been well documented. Increased lupine and nectar abundance, higher temperatures allowing for longer activity periods, and ease of finding mates have been suggested as possible reasons for adult preference of open areas. Adult Karner blue butterfly females are more likely to use shaded habitats than males. Avoiding harassment by males and compromising between greater amounts of wild lupine in open areas and better quality of wild lupine in shaded areas (see below) have been suggested as possible reasons for increased occurrence of females in shade. Differences between broods have also been observed. In west-central Wisconsin, abundance of spring adults positively correlated with decreasing canopy cover, while correlation with summer adults was very weak. At Indiana Dunes National Park, cover at late summer oviposition sites was significantly higher than at late spring oviposition sites. In Wisconsin and Minnesota, late spring oviposition sites occurred in partial and closed habitats significantly more than expected based on the number of nectar flowers and the cover and number of wild lupine stems, while summer oviposition sites did not differ significantly from expected. The different brood responses to shade may be due to the direct impact of varying environmental conditions over the course of the season on Karner blue butterflies (see section \\"Temperature\\") and the associated effects on wild lupine (see below). Larvae in shaded habitat apparently have an advantage over those in open areas. The increase in larvae in shaded habitats is likely due to effects of shade on wild lupine. Shade-grown wild lupine has been shown to provide higher quality larval resource than sun-grown lupine. Several reasons for this have been suggested. An often cited reason for the dependence of larvae, especially 2nd-brood larvae, on shaded habitat is the possibility of early senescence of wild lupine in open areas resulting in a lack of larval food. Shade-grown wild lupine being more nutritious, possibly due to nitrogen content limiting photosynthesis to a greater extent in open areas, was one of several explanations. The size of wild lupine has been positively associated with Karner blue butterfly larval length and amount of feeding damage. In addition, there may be shade-related effects on Karner blue butterflies that are related to the density of wild lupine. Wild lupine are typically more abundant in open areas than in shade. Mildew infection of wild lupine may be increased in denser wild lupine patches. Lower mildew infection rates in shadier areas have been reported. However the implications of mildew infection on Karner blue butterfly are uncertain (see section \\"Wild lupine\\"). It has also been suggested that the low density of wild lupine in shadier habitats could provide better larval habitat due to the increased search effort required by predators. This trade-off between lupine quality and quantity is another reason heterogeneous habitat is important for Karner blue butterfly. On sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, canopy cover did not have a significant (p>0.06) effect on total numbers of ants, parasitoids, or predators. However, certain species did show trends across canopy cover categories. For instance the ant Formica nitidiventris was only seen in open (≤15% cover) areas, while another ant, Dolichoderus plagiatus was only observed in areas with a dense canopy (≥76% cover). Parasitoids in the genera Phaeogenes and Orthostigma were all seen in closed habitats, while 90% of damsel bugs (Nabicula subcoleoptrata), a potential predator, were observed in open areas. Closed habitats had insignificantly (p=0.116) more parasitoids on average than partial (16%–75% cover) and closed habitats. =Nectar species= Nectar availability is likely to influence Karner blue butterfly abundance. In a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin, the frequency that Karner blue butterflies stayed in an area between recaptures was significantly (p<0.05) positively related to percent cover of nectar flowers such as Canadian horseweed (Conyza canadensis var. canadensis) and spotted beebalm (Monarda punctata). Preliminary results from a study in southeastern Minnesota suggest that openings where Karner blue butterflies were detected tended to have more flowering nectar species. In Michigan, more Karner blue butterflies were observed on sites with more nectaring plants, especially butterfly milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa). As discussed in Canopy cover, nectar species increase in open habitats. For instance, at Fort McCoy in west-central Wisconsin, all the nectar species listed for Karner blue butterflies require either full or partial sun.Leach, Mark K. (1993). \\"Status and distribution of the Karner blue butterfly at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin: final report on a two-year study\\". [Madison, WI]: The Nature Conservancy, Wisconsin Chapter. [Prepared for: U.S. Army, Fort McCoy Military Reservation, Natural Resource Management Division, Fort McCoy, WI]. Unpublished report on file at: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory, Missoula, MT In addition, treatments such as cutting with or without herbicides, herbicide application alone, or mowing at varying intervals resulted in a significant (p<0.01) increase in the number and cover of nectar species. See section \\"Food habits\\" for species that Karner blue butterflies use as nectar sources. Other habitat characteristics: Although Schweitzer asserts that the presence of litter is important to Karner blue butterflies in some years, abundance in a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin was negatively (p<0.05) related with average litter cover.Bidwell, Andrew D. (1995). Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) dispersal and habitat disturbance at Fort McCoy Military Reservation, Wisconsin. Stevens Point, WI: University of Wisconsin, Thesis In west-central Wisconsin, the amount of Karner blue butterfly larval feeding damage increased with grass cover. A review suggests that grass cover may provide roosting sites for Karner blue butterflies and that 5% cover of tall grass would most likely meet this need. =Disturbance= Karner blue butterflies may be associated with disturbance. Although results may have been biased by a significant (p=0.009) positive correlation (r=0.2173) between patch area and number of disturbances (such as burning, vehicle traffic, and thinning and clearing), patches in a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin occupied by Karner blue butterflies had a greater frequency of disturbance than unoccupied patches (p≤0.0125). In the same area, the abundance of the Karner blue butterfly spring brood was positively related to trails, and the percent of lupine stems with larval feeding damage was significantly (p<0.05) greater in areas disturbed by military vehicle traffic. =Temperature= Karner blue butterflies are directly affected by temperature. A laboratory investigation of temperature on Karner blue butterfly found that flight typically begins at 76 °F (24.6 °C) for females and 80 °F (26.4 °C) for males (p=0.25). Signs of heat stress started at 96 °F (35.6 °C) for females and 98 °F (36.8 °C) for males (p=0.25). In pine-oak barrens in Wisconsin, observation rates of Karner blue butterflies increased significantly (p=0.000) with increasing temperature. The effect of temperature can influence the occurrence of Karner blue butterflies in habitats of varying canopy cover. The lower temperatures occurring in partial and shaded habitats of Wisconsin and Minnesota meant that 1st-flight females only had access to these areas for a few hours a day. In contrast, these females could access open habitats an average of 10.5 hours a day. The percent of adults in habitats of varying canopy categories was significantly (p=0.0001) influenced by temperature, with butterflies, especially females, increasing in partial (15-75%) and shaded (>75%) habitats with increasing temperature. In addition, 80% (n=45) of 1st-flight ovipositions when temperatures were cool (68-79 °F, 20-26 °C) were in sun, while only 40% (n=17) of 1st-flight ovipositions in hot temperatures (86-97 °F, 30-36 °C) occurred in the sun. The same trend was observed in 2nd-flight ovipositions. In cool temperatures 65% (n=11) of ovipositions occurred in the sun, while in hot temperatures only 40% (n=37) occurred in the sun. Temperature also influences Karner blue butterfly phenology and brood success. Weather had strong influence on Karner blue butterfly phenology at Fort McCoy in west-central Wisconsin. In a cool year the 2nd-brood flight began 6 June, while in a warmer year adults were 1st detected on 22 May. In addition, compared to the previous year the flight of the 2nd-brood during the hot year was shortened by 20 days. At Indiana Dunes National Park, evidence suggests that cool winters negatively impact 1st-brood populations and cool summers positively affect 2nd-brood populations. A review suggests that the cover provided by snowpack protects Karner blue butterfly eggs from hatching prematurely or being overheated by direct sunlight. Therefore, short periods of continuous snow cover due to site conditions or mild winters could result in decreased occurrence or smaller populations of Karner blue butterflies. =Landscape effects= Karner blue butterflies are dependent on heterogeneous habitat as it provides the varied requirements of different Karner blue butterfly broods, sexes, and life stages over a wide range of environmental conditions. Research at Indiana Dunes National Park led to recommendations for canopy openings for adult males and nectaring of both sexes, as well as areas with 30-60% cover for ovipositing females. In the Allegan State Game Area, wild lupine patches occupied by Karner blue butterflies had higher density of edge habitats that unoccupied wild lupine patches. In west-central Wisconsin the importance of shaded habitat led to a recommendation that 20% to 40% of Karner blue butterfly habitat provide shaded lupine and that 1/3 have >60% canopy cover with succession in these dense areas allowed to progress to complete closure. Maxwell also suggests avoiding any management that would result in habitat homogenization. The Karner blue butterfly recovery team mentions the importance of a wide range of aspects, hydrology, microtopography as well canopy cover (0-90%) in conserving the Karner blue butterfly. However, Karner blue populations can persist in relatively homogenous habitats. For instance, a population has persisted at the Saratoga Airport in New York in open habitat maintained by regular mowing. More information on the habitat characteristics, environmental conditions, and/or geographic variability in habitat requirements that facilitate Karner blue butterfly's persistence in these areas is needed. Size of habitat patches can also influence Karner blue butterfly abundance (see section \\"Wild lupine\\"). At the Allegan State Game Area, wild lupine patches occupied by Karner blue butterflies were larger than unoccupied patches. This was also the case at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. In addition to the effect of amount of wild lupine, a review suggests that it is easier to maintain Karner blue butterfly habitat in larger patches. Lane notes the need to find a balance between having patches of different required habitats within the activity range of Karner blue butterflies and having open areas large enough that they do not become shaded too quickly. Canopy openings with diameters of at least 82 feet (25 m) were recommended based on research at Indiana Dunes National Park, and research in Wisconsin and Minnesota led to a recommended opening size of 1.5 times the height of adjacent trees. According to a review, subpopulations in habitat patches of less than 0.25 ha (0.62 acres) are vulnerable to extirpation. =Dispersal= Given their typically short dispersal distance, the spatial arrangement of habitat is important to the conservation of the Karner blue butterfly. Distance between the various types of habitat required by Karner blue butterflies is likely an influential landscape attribute. Lane suggests that suitable Karner blue butterfly habitat occurs in areas where open and closed canopies occur within a 590-foot (180 m) diameter. Maxwell recommends considering the amount of shaded wild lupine habitat within the dispersal distance of Karner blue butterfly when reducing overstory. Many investigators stress the importance of habitat patches being closely spaced. For instance, at sites in west-central Wisconsin, the average distance from an occupied wild lupine patch to another occupied patch was significantly (p=0.002) shorter (709 feet, 216 m) than to an unoccupied patch (1,155 feet, 352 m). Wild lupine patches in the same area that were occupied by Karner blue butterflies were also surrounded by a relatively low percentage of unoccupied patches. In addition, wild lupine patches in the Allegan State Game Area that were occupied by Karner blue butterflies were closer to other occupied patches than wild lupine patches without Karner blue butterflies. This led to the recommendation that habitat patches be within 230 feet (70 m) of each other. Isolation of habitat patches has been suggested as a reason for lack of Karner blue butterfly presence on sites in New York. In addition, studies of Karner blue butterfly dispersal have led to recommended distance between patches of ≤980 feet (300 m) to allow for dispersal and management units no wider than 1,300 to 1,600 feet (400–500 m) to improve recolonization of treated areas. The presence of dispersal corridors may assist with Karner blue butterfly dispersal. Karner blue butterflies appear to disperse further in open habitats (see section \\"Timing of major life history events\\"). However, there is uncertainty regarding what constitutes a corridor or a barrier to dispersal. Creation of corridors with both lupine for larvae and nectar species for adults may be useful in connecting habitat patches. Life history and reproduction Karner blue butterflies have two broods per year, following wild lupine (Lupinus perennis) phenology quite closely. Eggs laid by Karner blue butterflies in late summer overwinter and hatch in mid- to late April. Development from egg through four larval instars and pupation takes from 25 to 60 days. The average lifespan of adult Karner blue butterflies has been reported at between 3 and 5 days. The first Karner blue butterfly flight generally occurs sometime between mid-May and mid-June, with males typically appearing earlier than females. First flight females lay the vast majority of their eggs on wild lupine. These eggs develop into the adults of the second Karner blue butterfly flight, which generally occurs in July and August. Although always near a wild lupine plant, second brood females lay more eggs on grasses, other plants, and litter than 1st brood females. The 2nd flight is typically two to four times the size of the first flight. However, the first flight of Karner blue butterflies can be larger than the second. Timing and size of both flights can exhibit substantial variation, depending on local weather conditions among other factors. A wide range of values related to Karner blue butterfly recruitment have been reported. Adult Karner blue sex ratios vary from 1 male to 1.44 females to 2 males to 1 female. Wild caught Karner blue butterfly females have been observed to lay from 7.7 to 83 eggs on average. Reported percentages of eggs that reach adulthood under controlled conditions vary from 21.4% to 75.2%. In the wild, loss of eggs may be substantial. Karner blue butterflies do not typically move very far, with males usually moving further than females, with most studies showing average distances moved by individual butterflies of well under . Ecology =Food habits= Wild lupine is the sole larval food source of the Karner blue butterfly. Adult Karner blue butterflies obtain nectar from several native and nonnative species. Karner blue butterflies have been reported feeding on the nectar of 41 different species in a single study in west-central Wisconsin. Broods differ significantly in the species used for nectaring, likely due to differences in their phenology. Several blackberries have been documented as food sources for the spring brood, while spotted beebalm, white sweetclover (Melilotus alba), and flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), are widely cited sources of nectar in the summer. Common cinquefoil (Potentilla simplex) is used as a nectar species for both broods. Karner blue butterflies' preferred nectar species may include butterfly weed in New York and Michigan and lyrate rockcress (Arabis lyrata), lanceleaf tickseed (Coreopsis lanceolata), white sweetclover, and northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris) at Indiana Dunes National Park. Differences in nectar species used between male and female Karner blue butterflies and across locations have been reported. Other often mentioned nectar sources include New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), wild lupine, goldenrods (Solidago spp.), and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa). =Predators= Spiders and many insects are the major predators of Karner blue butterflies. The seven-spotted lady beetle is one of the few confirmed predators of Karner blue butterfly larvae. Paper wasps (Polistes spp.), spined soldier bugs, and ants (Formica spp.) have been observed removing larvae, and the ant Monomorium emarginatum has been seen chewing on Karner blue butterfly eggs. There is currently no explanation for the removal of larvae or chewing of eggs by some of the same ant species that tend larvae. Other potential predators of Karner blue butterfly larvae include green lacewings, soldier beetles, and damsel bugs. Predators of adult Karner blue butterflies include dragonflies, robber flies, ambush bugs (Phymatidae) and spiders, such as crab spiders. Assassin bugs (Reduviidae) are also likely predators of adult Karner blue butterflies. Other likely predators include white-tailed deer and birds. Incidental predation of Karner blue butterfly eggs, larvae, and pupae by white-tailed deer grazing on wild lupine can be substantial. Wasps are the most commonly reported parasitoids of Karner blue butterflies. A tachinid fly, Aplomya theclarum, has also been listed as a Karner blue butterfly parasite. Two wasps, one from the family Trichogrammatidae and another tentatively identified as a member of the family Eulophidae, are suspected to parasitize Karner blue butterfly eggs. = Mutualism with ants = Karner blue butterfly larvae benefit from a facultative, mutualistic relationship with several ant species. In pitch pine-bear oak (Pinus rigida-Quercus ilicifolia) habitat in New York, significantly more larvae tended by ants survived (67%) than untended larvae (38%). The 19 ant species tending Karner blue butterfly larvae were from the subfamilies Formicinae, Myrmicinae, and Dolichoderinae, which are the most common in the area. The species of ant is likely to influence the degree of benefit gained by Karner blue butterfly larvae. At sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, ant tending rates increased significantly with increasing larval age. The Karner blue larvae also has fine hairs on it to protect itself. In a study of the effect of different experimental feeding treatments, Karner blue butterfly larvae tended by ants had one of the shortest observed larval durations and gained the most weight for the amount of lupine eaten.  Management considerations  thumbalt=Large brown sign with pictures of blue butterflies next to a trail through oak savanna Trail signage regarding the Karner blue at Miller Woods in Indiana Dunes National Park. According to reviews, habitat loss through direct conversion to other land uses and through succession are considered the major causes of the decline of the Karner blue butterfly. At the time of this writing (2006), two reviews summarize the recent status of Karner blue butterfly across its range. Recovery criteria are addressed by, while Christenson and Lentz discuss lessons learned developing a statewide Habitat Conservation Plan for Wisconsin. Articles that address Karner blue butterfly sampling methodology include. Swengel found that surveys for Karner blue butterfly adults appeared more efficient than those for larvae. Evidence of different catchability and/or detectability of male and female Karner blue butterflies led King to suggest calculating male and female population sizes separately. General descriptions of Karner blue butterfly rearing methods and translocation/ reintroduction techniques are available. A wide variety of management techniques can be compatible with maintaining Karner blue butterfly populations when attention is paid to implementing them at appropriate times and at intensities, scales, and frequencies that Karner blue butterflies can tolerate. For example, mowing can maintain open areas with little to no detrimental effect on Karner blue butterflies on sites where burning is impractical or in areas too small to support populations of Karner blue butterflies likely to survive a burn. On restored oak savanna sites in south- central Wisconsin, no significant (p=0.924) differences were detected between Karner blue butterfly densities on sites burned in summer, sites mowed in August, and control sites. Mowing with a blade height >4 inches (10 cm) should be performed annually or biennially in the fall or winter and clippings should be left in place. Effects of mowing, burning, and other management techniques and land uses on the average number of Karner blue butterflies observed per survey hour are included in. Recommendations on the use of a wide range of management techniques such as thinning, rotational grazing, and planting of wild lupine and/or nectar species can be found in. According to reviews and general field observations, management activities that are typically harmful to Karner blue butterflies include management that increases deer and/or grouse populations, close-cropped grazing, frequent or poorly-timed mowing, plowing, use of herbicides that kill lupine or nectar plants, and use of pesticides that are detrimental to Karner blue butterflies, ants they associate with, or pollinators of species they use for nectar. Information on the impacts of an insecticide on Karner blue butterflies and some herbicides on Karner blue butterflies as well as lupine and nectar species are available. According to the Karner blue butterfly recovery plan, management activities that can have a detrimental effect should be timed to allow at least 2 generations between repeat treatments and, if possible, critical subpopulations should be divided into discrete management units. =Nectar= Given the wide range of nectar species used by Karner blue butterfly (see section \\"Food habits\\"), planting several often used or preferred nectar species is favored over selecting 1 or 2 specific species. Species selection should attempt to provide nectar sources in both open and partially shaded conditions throughout the growing season despite yearly variation in environmental conditions. Planting nonnative nectar sources is discouraged due to their potential impacts on native food sources, especially wild lupine. =Heterogeneity= Heterogeneity is an important feature of Karner blue butterfly habitat. Specific recommendations regarding the spatial arrangement of the various required habitat types and Karner blue butterfly habitat patches are discussed in Landscape effects. Creation and rotation of management units should incorporate this information as well as data on Karner blue butterfly movement (see section \\"Timing of major life history events\\"). Bidwell recommends management units be a maximum of 1,300 to 1,600 feet (400–500 m) wide to improve recolonization from neighboring areas. Depending on the available and surrounding habitat, managing for heterogeneity could mean implementing a wide range of techniques.

Kisekae is short for \\"kisekae ningyou\\"; a Japanese term meaning \\"dress-up dolls\\". Unlike \\"computer art\\" which creates or displays traditional art via a computer, KiSS uses the computer as the medium, allowing the art to be not only animated, but also interactive. Availability KiSS is an Open standard which has to some extent been implemented on many platforms, including several PDAs. It has also been implemented in Java and on the web. History KiSS originated in Japan in 1991 with \\"dolls\\" based on shōjo manga characters. The original dolls, a series of simple, static images, could be moved about and layered on top of one another to look as if the doll image was wearing the clothing. Using computer graphics had the advantage over traditional paper dolls in allowing multiple layers to move in unison, including visually separate pieces, giving an illusion of depth not possible with physical paper. The initial viewer software was designed for NEC PC-9800 series using a palette of 16 colours to display the doll. Shortly after, an enhanced standard was put forward (General Specification 2 known as 'KiSS/GS2') which included support for VGA cards and 256 or multiple 16 colour palettes. This standard is still the basis of KiSS, but several additional specifications have been incorporated into viewers since then, in particular \\"French KiSS\\", generally called FKiSS, for controlling interactivity and animation and \\"Cherry KiSS\\" (i.e. CKiSS) for 32-bit \\"true\\" colour support. By the late 1990s KiSS had spread from the Japanese BBS communities internationally via the Internet with artists creating \\"dolls\\", programmers creating support tools, and fans appearing worldwide. Note that although KiSS sets are often referred to generically as 'dolls' they are not confined to dress-up — in fact they can be anything and there are \\"build-your-own\\" faces, wedding cakes, dollhouses, battleships, as well as puzzles, games and much more. Nonetheless such \\"unusual\\" sets are sometimes referred to as aberrant KiSS. Format A KiSS set consists of many files of a number of different formats. These are packaged for distribution as a single set or 'doll' in LZH format (a preferred archive format in Japan) which viewer programs can read as a whole to obtain the individual files. Most files are 'cel' files which are raw, uncompressed graphics data analogous to animation cels. KiSS/GS2 specification cels also require a KCF (KiSS Colour File) as a palette, but CKiSS specification cels do not. A KCF also can control background colour and contain multiple palettes that can be swapped for lighting and colour change effects. All KiSS binary files (KCF, standard and CKiSS cels) since KiSS/GS2 share a common 32 byte binary header record identifying the size, type and format of KiSS data they contain. A configuration file is also required to control field size, layering, cel position, use of palettes, and interaction and animation events. In addition Midi files for music and WAV files for sound clips may be used, and generally some form of text documentation is included by the artist. =Expansions= KiSS sets are allowed to acquire resources from other KiSS sets by a process called 'Expansion'. This allows new versions of a doll without incorporating the original cells into the new set, meaning that earlier versions did not have to be replaced, and different artists could add to the doll without confusion as to who the original artist was. This dates from some of the earliest viewers, but the details of loading an expansion set remain somewhat viewer dependent. Extensions A number of features have been added to KiSS but never formally incorporated into the main KiSS format. For compatibility and to hide them from viewers that don't support them they are disguised as comments in the configuration file. Each type of extension (except user grouping) was initially introduced in Japan, however all (except Cherry KiSS) have later been extended by international viewers. =French KiSS= 'French' KiSS (or 'FKiSS') is an event driven scripting language created as an experimental add-on to the KiSS/GS2 specifications. It was introduced in Japan to allow animation and greater interactivity in KiSS. It was the first extension, and intended only for testing but it proved so popular that it became entrenched as is. All FKiSS directives appear preceded in the first column of their configuration line by: ;@ The \\";\\" normally indicates the beginning of a comment, which originally hid the directive if a viewer didn't handle FKiSS although it is now standard in all viewers. FKiSS itself has been extended several times: * 'FKiSS2' was first implemented by a group of international programmers creating viewers for alternate platforms. It adds collision detection, relative movement and some simple condition tests. This Level of FKiSS is supported by all but the very oldest viewers. This was the last Level supported in Japan. * 'FKiSS3' added variables, math and flow control, making it more nearly a full scripting language. * 'FKiSS4' simplifies and extends FKiSS capabilities, particularly with support for user groupings, but there are so far few viewers that support it. =Initialization Tags= These are additions to the cell definitions to control start up properties. They appear as a comment at the end of the cell definition that immediately starts with a % and a code. The first (%t - to control initial transparency) was added when the first level of FKiSS was finalized. Other properties added with FKiSS4 include display status (%u), clickability (%g) and offset overrides (%x and %y). =Pragmas= These are comment added to the configuration to suggest to the viewer program how best to automatically display the set. Originally used in Japan to indicate other KiSS sets of which the current one is an expansion (;INCLUDE -- i.e. where to find referenced resources not included in the set), later viewers use them to indicate optimal settings for the set being loaded (;HINT). =Cherry KiSS= Commonly called 'CKiSS', this is an extension to the binary data header record, and unlike other extensions makes no changes to the configuration file. It is a specification allowing a cell file to contain raw 24-bit colour data and an 8 bit alpha channel for variable transparency. CKiSS cells tend to use a lot of disk space compared to palette-based cels, and do not compress well, so they are used sparingly by most artists. =Groupings= User groupings were added along with FKiSS4 to simplify controlling large numbers of cells (or uniquely identify specific cells) for testing and animation. Creating KiSS There are many programs on most platforms which can convert from standard graphics formats (most commonly BMP, GIF or PSD files) to KiSS cel and KCF files, allowing the artist to create the original images with any freeware or proprietary graphics program. In addition, GIMP is a fully featured graphics program which can open and save CEL files directly, leaving no need for conversion. The configuration file is written with a text editor (standard as part of any Operating System software). Once the basic files are created a KiSS viewer is used to display and fine tune the set, then an archiver with LZH capability is used for packaging. All the software needed is freely available on the internet, as are detailed tutorials for KiSS creation. Community The modern KiSS community on the internet resembles the dolling community with which there is a degree of overlap, though the two are distinct and each is protective of its own art. However, since KiSS art is more specialized the KiSS community is centralized around the largest archive of dolls on the internet, the BiG KiSS Page. Unfortunately in recent years bandwidth costs have forced the BKP to allow most doll downloads by subscription only, which has had negative impacts on the size of the active community. Because being able to dress a doll implies being able to undress as well there has always been a subgenre of 'adult' KiSS which exists independently of the main community.

Previous theories suggested that each molecule was only ten nucleotides long. * He provided William Astbury with well prepared samples of DNA for Astbury's pioneering structural measurements. * In 1936, in his doctoral thesis in chemistry, presented at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, he first studied genetic material inside a cell with an ultraviolet microscope to determine the nucleic acid content of cellular structures such as the nucleus and nucleolus using the Feulgen reaction to stain the DNA. * He worked with Jack Schultz in Stockholm from 1937–1939 on protein synthesis is cells and published the work in 1939, where he independent of Jean Brachet, working out the same problem using a different technique, found that cells making proteins are rich in ribonucleic acids RNA, implying that RNA is required to make proteins. This was summarised in his book 'Cell Growth and Cell Function' (1950). * He received a personal professorship from the Swedish state in 1944. * He became head of the newly created department for cell research and genetics at the Medical Nobel Institute, at the Karolinska, in 1945. * He was the first to study the giant chromosomes found in insect larvae. * He studied the role of the nucleolus in protein synthesis. * He examined the relationship between the quantity of heterochromatin (chromosomes with few genes) and the rate of growth of cancer cells. * In 1969 when working at the Karolinska Institute, he (with Lore Zech) found that a stain (quinacrine mustard) caused chromosomes to show light and dark lateral bands along their length. This banding method permits the accurate identification of all 22 autosomes and the X and Y chromosomes. This technique highlighted slight structural abnormalities and specific identification of the extra chromosomes involved in conditions such as Down's syndrome (see also cytogenetics).

She won seven Wimbledon Women's Singles titles and a gold medal at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Tennis In 1900 Douglass made her singles debut at Wimbledon and, after a bye in the first round, lost her second round match to Louisa Martin. Three years later, she won her first of seven ladies singles titles. On 6 April 1907 she married Robert Lambert Chambers and was thereafter known by her married surname Lambert Chambers. In 1908 she won the gold medal in the women's singles event at the 1908 Summer Olympics after a straight-sets victory in the final against compatriot Dora Boothby. She wrote Tennis for Ladies, which was published in 1910. The book contained photographs of tennis techniques and contained advice on attire and equipment. In 1911 Lambert Chambers won the women's final at Wimbledon against Dora Boothby 6–0, 6–0, the first player to win a Grand Slam singles final without losing a game. The only other female player to achieve this was Steffi Graf when she defeated Natalia Zvereva in the 1988 French Open final. In 1919 Lambert Chambers played the longest Wimbledon final up to that time: 44 games against Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen. Lambert Chambers held two match points at 6–5 in the third set but eventually lost to Lenglen 8–10, 6–4, 7–9. Lambert Chambers only played sporadic singles after 1921 but continued to compete in doubles until 1927. She made the singles quarter-finals of the US Open in 1925 and, from 1924 to 1926, she captained Britain's Wightman Cup team. In the 1925 Wightman Cup edition she played, at the age of 46, a singles (against Eleanor Goss) and doubles match and won both. In 1928 she turned to professional coaching. Lambert Chambers was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981. She died in Kensington, London.

He made his first appearance at Temesvar in 1851, and after engagements at Hermannstadt and Graz came in the winter of 1855-1856 to Königsberg in Prussia. His first performance was so successful that he was engaged by Heinrich Laube for the Burgtheater in Vienna, making his first appearance as Mortimer in Schiller's Maria Stuart. Under Laube's careful tuition he developed within three years into an actor of the first order, excelling both in tragedy and comedy; and in 1882, after twenty-five years of brilliant service at the Court Theatre, he was given a patent of nobility. In 1884 he became manager-in-chief of the theatre; and in 1887-1888 acted as artistic advisor. He visited the United States in 1885, and again in 1899 and 1902, achieving great success.

On the final night of Spittoono XXXVII, it was announced from the stage that a new sponsor has agreed to assume the project, so Spittoono lives. The RPAA announced on September 8, 2017, that $18,000 was being donated to a dozen charities, raised during the year's event.

Recovery's program is based on self-control, self-confidence, and increasing one's determination to act. Recovery deals with a range of people, all of whom have difficulty coping with everyday problems, whether or not they have a history of psychiatric hospitalization. It is non-profit, secular, and although it uses methods devised by Low, most groups are currently led by experienced non- professionals.  History  Previous Recovery Logo In 1937, Abraham Low, a neuropsychiatrist, was on the faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and participants in Recovery were limited to those who had been hospitalized in the Psychiatric Institute at the University. At that time, Recovery Inc. was an entity of the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of Illinois Research and Education Hospital. The original thirty- seven founding members had recovered their mental health after receiving insulin shock treatments at the Institute. Low began the groups as part of an attempt to improve the patient's care following discharge from his hospital. In the early years of the organization he encouraged members to advocate for improvements in social policies regarding state mental health regulations. Following backlash from the medical community to these efforts, Low disbanded the group in 1941. His patients, however, asked to be trained to teach Recovery's methods to others and in 1942 Low began to teach members to lead groups in their homes. The organization separated from the Psychiatric Institute in 1942, operating out of private offices in Chicago. New membership at this time was drawn largely from patients in Low's private psychiatry practice. During the first years following its separation Low remained in close contact with all Recovery groups and received regular reports from group leaders. As the membership and number of meetings grew, it made this level of cooperation with the groups untenable. In 1952, Low allowed expansion of Recovery outside of Illinois, giving control of local groups to former patients who had become group leaders. Following Low's death in 1954, Recovery transitioned completely from a professionally run treatment adjunct, to a peer-run self-help group. Effective January 1, 2007 Recovery, Inc. formally changed its name to Recovery International. On January 1, 2008 Recovery International merged with The Abraham Low Institute and provisionally renamed the new organization Recovery International / The Abraham Low Institute (RI/TALI). On January 1, 2009, Abraham Low Self-Help Systems was incorporated to umbrella several new programs, and the group continues operations as Recovery International and Abraham Low Self-Help Systems in various states and internationally.  Fundamental concepts  = Symptoms = The causes and classification of mental illnesses are considered irrelevant in the Recovery method. Recovery members are simply viewed as people who have developed disturbing symptom-reactions leading to ill-controlled behavior. Symptoms are threatening sensations; including feelings, impulses, and obsessive thoughts. The phrase, \\"symptomatic idiom\\" describes the mental association of danger with symptoms. The symptomatic idiom implies that there is an impending catastrophe of physical collapse, mental collapse, or permanent handicap. In the first instance, for example, a person may consider heart palpitations as signaling that sudden death is imminent, or that a painful headache is caused by a brain tumor; phobias, compulsions, and ruminations would eventually cause a mental collapse. The fear of permanent handicap insists that there is no cure or relief for one's mental illness and that recovery is impossible. = Temper = Temper is a combination of a feeling and a judgment about oneself or others. The feeling is related to one of the two types of temper, fear or anger. The judgment is that one has been wronged by another, or that one has done something wrong. \\"Fearful temper\\" arises from thoughts that one has made a mistake (has done something wrong) which in turn causes feelings such as fear, shame and inadequacy. \\"Angry temper\\" results from the belief that one has been wronged which in turn creates feelings of indignation and impatience. There is a two-way relationship between temper and symptoms. Symptoms induce emotions such as fear and anger, which in turn induce temper, which increases the intensity of the symptoms. \\"Temperamental lingo\\" describes language related to judgments of right and wrong, and the use of defeatist language when discussing symptoms. When discussing symptoms, temperamental lingo includes the use of adjectives such as \\"intolerable,\\" \\"uncontrollable,\\" \\"unbearable,\\" and similar language that places an emphasis on the dangerous and fatalistic implications of feelings, impulses, or thoughts. = Will = Free will is fundamental to Recovery's method. The subconscious, as it is known in psychoanalysis, as well as viewpoints emphasizing unconscious motivations, drives, and instincts are considered to be self-defeating. Recovery considers adults as capable of behaving based on deliberate plans, settled decisions, reasoned conclusions and firm determinations. Will gives adults the ability to accept or reject thoughts and impulses. Recovery members achieve mental health by training their Wills to reject self-defeating thoughts and impulses, countering them with self-endorsing thoughts and wellness-promoting actions. =External and Internal Environment= Recovery distinguishes between the External Environment, the realities of a situation, and the Internal Environment, one's own subjective feelings, thoughts, impulses, and sensations. Two components of the Internal Environment, thoughts and impulses, can be directly controlled by Will. Control of thoughts and impulses allows indirect control over sensations and feelings. For instance, thoughts of insecurity and anxiousness can be replaced with thoughts of security. Similarly, a feeling of fear can be disposed by removing the associated belief of danger (symptomatic idiom). While the Internal Environment can be changed with cognitive reframing, changing one's External Environment may or may not be possible. = Nervousness = Recovery focuses on treating former mental patients, sometimes referred to as postpsychotic persons, as well as psychoneurotic persons. The latter group is most often referred to as \\"nervous\\" or \\"nervous patients\\". Recovery members may refer to themselves as \\"nervous patients\\" regardless of whether they are being treated by a physician or other professional. Sociologist Edward Sagarin described this as a compromise between the term neurotic and the more colloquial phrase \\"nervous breakdown\\".  Common techniques  Recovery encourages members to cognitively reframe their experiences using several techniques. Spotting, reframing defeatist language, self-endorsement and creating Examples are the most commonly cited in scholarly reviews of Recovery. = Spotting = Spotting is an introspective relabeling of thoughts and symptoms. When a thought arises related to angry temper, fearful temper, or associating danger with a symptom it must be spotted and reframed. Members practice spotting and reacting appropriately to the distressing thought or symptom. = Reframing language = Recovery developed its own language for labeling psychiatric symptoms and responding to them. This language is centered around two concepts, \\"authority\\" and \\"sabotage.\\" It is suggested that members rely on the authority of a physician's diagnosis with respect to their symptoms. For instance, if a member self-diagnoses a headache as being caused by a brain tumor, but a physician has diagnosed it otherwise, then the member is said to be sabotaging the physician's authority. This is similarly true for the member's prognosis, if a member despairs that their condition is hopeless, but a physician has found the prognosis to be good, this is also sabotage of the physician's authority. Using the physician's perspective to reframe defeatist thoughts is intended to help members recognize that they have not lost control, and their situation can be coped with. = Self-endorsement = Members practice self-endorsement of every effort made to use a Recovery method, no matter how small and regardless of the outcome. In this way, similar subsequent efforts will require less work and are more likely to be successful. Similarly members are taught to change their behavior in \\"part acts\\" (small steps), to simply \\"move their muscles\\" to complete tasks, however small, to eventually complete larger overwhelming tasks. = Creating Examples = The Example format was created by Low as a means to allow Recovery to function as a stand-alone lay self-help group that would not require professional supervision. Members create Examples by following a four-part outline, each part requiring a description. # Details of an event that caused distress. # The symptoms and discomfort that the event aroused. # How Recovery principles were utilized to cope with the event. # How the member would have behaved in response to the event before joining Recovery. Examples are a formalized way to practice the Recovery program. A successful outcome is not required to create an Example, as all attempts at practicing Recovery methods are endorsed.  Meetings  = 1937–1952 = During the first fifteen years of Recovery, Low required members to attend classes and meetings for at least six months at a cost of ten dollars per month, not including the membership dues of two dollars per year. Members would meet at least three days a week and on Wednesdays take part in panel discussions as panelists or audience members held at a private home. Panel discussions would consist of three to four panelists with considerable experience in Recovery discussing a topic from Low's literature, focusing on spotting and conquering symptoms. Dr. Low would address the audience at the end of each panel discussion summing up the discussion and correcting any misinformation given about Recovery. Every Thursday Low would conduct a group psychotherapy class for Recovery members. No meetings were held between Saturday and Wednesday. Commonly, novice members would have a \\"setback,\\" a relapse of psychiatric symptoms, during this time. As setbacks were considered unavoidable, the novice members were assigned to a more experienced member to call or visit should they need assistance. If the assistance provided by the experienced member was not helpful, they could contact a chairperson in their area (a member who functioned like the physician's deputy), and if that was still not satisfactory they could contact the physician, Dr. Low. = 1952–Present = At the meetings, members share examples from their lives that caused nervous symptoms, the thoughts that occurred just beforehand, how they spotted them and reacted to them. Other members offer alternative ways of looking at the situation and suggest how to better handle similar symptoms in the future. Meetings range in size from 6 to 30 members and follow a rigid schedule to ensure adherence to Recovery methods. Each meeting has a leader in a permanent position; leadership duties do not rotate from meeting to meeting. Each meeting is split into five parts. Members introduce themselves by first name only, as is practiced in Alcoholics Anonymous. Reading of Recovery literature The beginning of a meeting is generally reserved for reading from Recovery literature. Members take turns reading sections of a chapter or article. Group leaders will often call on new members during this period, or members who are hesitant to volunteer. After finishing a paragraph a group leader will often ask a member if they experienced any symptoms while reading the literature and will endorse them for the efforts to continue reading despite feelings of discomfort or fear of making mistakes. Presentation of Examples Only members who have read Mental Health Through Will Training are allowed to participate in this portion of the meeting. Those participating form a \\"panel\\" although they are usually seated face-to-face around a table. The group leader reminds the members that examples should be constructed around day-to-day events as Recovery is a non- professional organization and cannot help people with major problems. This statement is qualified, however, with Low's opinion that the majority of a nervous patient's problems are related to \\"trivial\\" incidents. Rather than being a limitation of Recovery's program, this is intended to be a novel treatment approach. A day-today trivial event may generalize to other problems experienced by the member. Discussion of trivialities is less threatening than complex problems, making a discussion of coping mechanisms possible. A survey of groups in Chicago in 1971 and 1977 found that most examples presented were stories of successful application of the Recovery method, less than ten percent represented \\"problem examples\\" where the application was not successful. Group participation After an Example has been given, the meeting is opened for \\"group spotting\\". During this period other members of the panel are allowed to comment on the Example based on Recovery principles. This group leader usually makes the first comments, and if there are no volunteers to continue, he or she may call on panel members to provide commentary. Comments not based on Recovery's concepts or not related to the example are stopped by the group leader. Comments are either classed as positive, praise for application of a Recovery method, or negative, related to an instance where a method was not applied. An Example rarely passes without mention of additional Recovery techniques that could be applied to it. This serves as a constant reminder that Recovery's method can never be practiced perfectly; members can always learn from experience and benefit from group practice. For example, a person may experience \\"lowered feelings\\" (depression) because they are aiming for a perfect performance. Trying to be perfect or trying to appear perfect leads one to feel down if one makes even the slightest mistake. All improvements, no matter how small, are acknowledged and members are encouraged to endorse themselves for their efforts—not for their successes. Longstanding members are encouraged to share their success with the Recovery methods to help newcomers. Low saw the sharing of successes by veteran members as an essential component of meetings, as it demonstrates that distressing sensations can be endured, impulses can be controlled, and obsessions can be checked. Question and answer Following the panel presentation, about fifteen minutes are set aside for a question and answer period. Any member may ask a question of the panel during this time, newcomers are especially encouraged to participate. Discussion, however, must be limited to the Examples given and related Recovery concepts. Discussion questioning Recovery's method is not allowed. Discussion of psychological theories outside of Recovery is similarly discouraged. In a case where a member brings up a disagreement between his physician and a Recovery concept, he or she is told that the panel is not qualified to provide an answer not related to the Examples presented. Members are expected to follow the advice of their professional; Recovery is not intended as a substitute for psychiatric services, but a self-directed program that can be used as an adjunct to professional treatment, or alone when professional treatment is not available. Mutual aid meeting The formal meeting ends with the question and answer period, and an informal \\"mutual-aid\\" gathering usually follows. During this time refreshments are usually served. Members may speak freely with one another and discuss problems or ask for advice, although there is an attempt to keep the discussion within the bounds of Recovery concepts. By convention, discussion of problems are limited to five minutes in an attempt to discourage self-pity and complaining.  Demographics  The results here are from a 1960 survey of groups in Chicago and Michigan. 1,875 surveys were sent; the results are based on the 779 that were returned. =Meeting attendance and tenure= The 1960 survey of members found participation in Recovery to be a regular and long-term activity. About one-third of the respondents had been in Recovery for less than a year, another third had been in Recovery for one to two years, and another third had participated for two years or more. Most members reported attending meetings weekly, although one-third reported that they no longer needed to attend meetings to function adequately. Observation of meetings in Chicago during 1971 and 1977 found the average member attended only about 37% of meetings, and also found that it was common for newcomers to only attend one meeting and never return. Recovery does not have a graduation or discharge procedure for members. There is a conflicting goal in Recovery in that while it is intended to rehabilitate members, it also needs to sustain itself to continue this goal, creating a potential danger that rehabilitation of members may be subverted by efforts to maintain the organization's membership. Professional treatment goals, however, generally emphasize the importance of adherence to therapeutic practices. The concern is more commonly that patients will not follow through with them, rather than that they will never stop practicing them. =Socioeconomic status= According to the 1960 survey, most Recovery respondents are middle-aged, middle-class, female and married with an employed spouse. A survey of members from 1971 and 1977 estimated the mean age of members to be 49 years, and found that most of them were lower middle-class or working class. In contrast, studies of similar groups found most members had never been married, but similar to a specific study of Emotions Anonymous that found most of the members were middle class. Other studies of self-help groups for people with serious mental illness found most of the members were unemployed, while others found members to be predominately working class. A ratio of two (or more) females for every male is common in studies of self-help groups for persons with serious mental illness. =Hospitalization= The 1960 survey found few members with extensive histories of treatment for mental illness prior to joining Recovery. Half of the respondents reported no previous hospitalization, and about one- fifth had never been treated professionally for a mental illness. Members who reported being hospitalized reported very few instances of short duration. More recent studies have shown that in self-help groups for serious mental illness, approximately 60% (55–75%) of members had been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons. =Reasons for joining Recovery= Most respondents to the 1960 survey reported having heard of Recovery in the lay press, and joined at the suggestion of a friend or relative. Just one-tenth of the respondents reported having been referred by a physician. They reported joining because of psychological symptoms (fears, delusions, and \\"nerves\\"), psychosomatic symptoms (tremors and heart palpitations) and also out of curiosity to see if the organization would help. A survey of members from 1971 and 1977 also found that most members were self-referred.  Organizational structure  From 1952 to 2008, Recovery was run from its office in Chicago by a twelve-member Board of Directors, a number of committees, organization officers, and a full-time paid administrative staff. The Board of Directors was elected at Recovery's annual meeting and served for a period of three years. Authority from the Board of Directors was passed to Area Leaders then to Assistant Area Leaders, District Leaders, and lastly to Group Leaders. Leaders are trained to run Recovery meetings, but are not considered experts or authorities. Policies and practices of Recovery were made by the Board of Directors.  Family participation  In the early years of Recovery, an event was held on Saturday afternoons at Recovery's office in Chicago for Recovery members as well as their relatives and friends. Later, family and friends of members were allowed to attend meetings, although not to participate. In 1943 Low published a book, Lectures to Relatives of Former Patients to help assist them with the recovery effort; this information was later reprinted in Peace Versus Power in the Family: Domestic Discord and Emotional Distress in 1967.  Effectiveness  : For more details on this topic, see Self-help groups for mental health: Effectiveness In 1945, Abraham Low found the average member improved considerably after the first or second week in the program as it existed at that time. However, members were required to lose their major symptoms within two months of membership and class attendance. If they did not, this was taken as an indication that the member was still sabotaging the physician's efforts. A 1984 study found that following participation in Recovery, former mental patients reported no more anxiety about their mental health than the general public. Members rated their life satisfaction levels as high, or higher, than the general public. Members who had participated two years or more reported the highest levels of satisfaction with their health. Members who participated for less than two years tended to still be taking medication and living below the poverty level with smaller social networks. A 1988 study found that participation in Recovery decreased members' symptoms of mental illness and the amount of psychiatric treatment needed. About half of the members had been hospitalized before joining. Following participation, less than 8% had been hospitalized. Members' scores of neurotic distress decreased, and scores of psychological well-being for longstanding members were no different from members of a control group in the same community. Long-term members were being treated with less psychiatric medication and psychotherapy than newer members.

Introduction  It is part of the basic framework of the American legal system that the U.S. Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of questions of federal law but the state courts are the ultimate arbiters of the laws of each state. See, e.g., Hortonville Joint School District No. 1. v. Hortonville Education Ass’n, 426 U.S. 482, 488 (1976) (“We are, of course, bound to accept the interpretation of [State] law by the highest court of the State.”). Thus, generally speaking, the U.S. Supreme Court has the authority (“jurisdiction”) to review state court determinations of federal law, but lacks jurisdiction to review state court determinations of state law. See 28 U.S.C. § 1257. This general rule is simple to apply in cases clearly involving only one body of law. If that law is federal, then the U.S. Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the state court judgment; if it is state law, then it does not. However, because litigants can (and often do) raise federal claims in state courts, many cases are not so simple, and this general rule breaks down. Indeed, state courts often dismiss cases raising federal claims because they fail to comply with state-law procedures, and in some cases federal and state law are not clearly distinct; instead they are intertwined. The adequate and independent state ground doctrine provides certain exceptions to this general rule and guides the U.S. Supreme Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over these complex cases.  Doctrine  The adequate and independent state ground doctrine states that when a litigant petitions the U.S. Supreme Court to review the judgment of a state court which rests upon both federal and non-federal (state) law, the U.S. Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over the case if the state ground is (1) “adequate” to support the judgment, and (2) “independent” of federal law. See Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1038 (1983) (“It is, of course, incumbent upon this Court to ascertain for itself whether the asserted non-federal ground independently and adequately supports the judgment.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296 U.S. 207, 210 (1935) (“[W]here the judgment of a state court rests upon two grounds, one of which is federal and the other non- federal in character, our jurisdiction fails if the non-federal ground is independent of the federal ground and adequate to support the judgment.”); Murdock v. City of Memphis, (\\"[W]hether there exist other matters in the record actually decided by the State court which are sufficient to maintain the judgment of that court, notwithstanding the error in deciding the Federal question. In [that case] the court would not be justified in reversing the judgment of the State court.\\"). The “adequacy” prong primarily focuses on state court dismissals of federal claims on state procedural grounds, as procedural requirements are by definition logically antecedent. Antecedent state-law grounds (i.e., state rules of procedure) are adequate to support a judgment unless they (1) are arbitrary, unforeseen, or otherwise deprive the litigant of a reasonable opportunity to be heard, see, e.g., Staub v. City of Baxley, 355 U.S. 313, 319-20 (1958), or (2) impose an undue burden on the ability of litigants to protect their federal rights, see, e.g., Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 138 (1988). The “independence” prong focuses on decisions where the state and federal rules are not clearly distinct. If it is not \\"apparent from the four corners” of the opinion that the judgment rests on an independent state law rule, then, unless it is “necessary or desirable” to obtain clarification from the state court itself, the Supreme Court will presume that the decision rested in part on federal law, thereby rendering it reviewable. Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1040 & n.6. Furthermore, when federal law limits the states’ ability to change the definition of state- created legal interests, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review the state court’s characterization of the law both before and after the change. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court routinely reviews state court determinations of state property law to determine whether a litigant has been deprived of “property” within the meaning of the Due Process clause.

Founded on 8 March 1948 in Łódź (Lodz), it is the most prominent institutions of higher education in the city. History Until 1958, the school existed as two separate schools: one for actors and the other for filmmakers. The schools and the Polish cinema industry were moved from Warsaw to the nearby city of Łódź after World War II. This move was initially seen as a temporary measure, thus the name of the actors' school was The National Higher School of Theatre in Warsaw with seat in Łódź. Its creator and the first rector was the renowned Polish actor Leon Schiller, current namesake of the school. In 1949, it was divided into two branches; one actually moved to Warsaw and the other one remained in Łódź under the directorship of Kazimierz Dejmek (since 1950). The years leading up to the merger in 1958 were those in which notable artists of the Polish Film School created the reputation of the Łódź Film School as the most liberal and least Communist institution of higher education in Poland. Among the most notable alumni of that period were Andrzej Munk, Janusz Morgenstern, Andrzej Wajda, and Kazimierz Kutz. In 1954, they were joined by Roman Polanski. After 1958, the school became one of the most notable cultural think-tanks of Poland, with many outsiders and artists not supported by the Communist authorities joining it. Various discussion clubs and relative liberty of speech promoted by the new rector, Jerzy Toeplitz, added to its value. For instance, two of the students of the university (Jerzy Matuszkiewicz and Witold Sobociński) became the first jazz musicians in Poland after World War II to be allowed by the authorities to organize a concert. Kirk Douglas visited the school in 1966. His visit was documented in the self- titled documentary Kirk Douglasy. After the events of March 1968, the period of liberty came to an end. Toeplitz was fired, as were most of the tutors. However, with the advent of Edward Gierek and his regime, the school once again started to bloom. The School has three Oscar-winning alumni: Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda, and Zbigniew Rybczyński, while alumnus Krzysztof Kieślowski was nominated for an Oscar. Both Polanski and Wajda won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 and 1981, respectively.

The IWPS have been working on its restoration since 1968 The Bugsworth Basin Heritage Trust (BBHT), formerly known as the Inland Waterways Protection Society (IWPS), is a British organisation founded in 1958 to work for the restoration of the canal system. Its members carried out surveys of canals and produced reports in support of their retention when much of the canal network was under threat. Following official support for use of the canals for leisure activities in 1967, the Society have concentrated their efforts on the restoration and operation of Bugsworth Basin, located at the southern end of the Peak Forest Canal, which was one of the first canals that they surveyed in 1958. Background Following the nationalisation of much of the canal network in 1948, and despite official attitudes which often saw the canals only as commercial highways, there had been some progress towards using them for pleasure cruising. On 17 March 1954, the Minister of Transport announced in Parliament that the British Transport Commission would be considering the plight of the network. A Board of Survey, under the chairmanship of Lord Rusholme, prepared the report, which was published in April 1955. This divided the existing canals into three groups. Group 1, consisting of the River Trent, the River Severn, the River Lee Navigation, the River Weaver, the Aire and Calder Navigation and the southern part of the Grand Union Canal, should be retained and improved. This group included just of waterway. A further were included in group 2. This group included most of the narrow canals that still had significant commercial traffic and some wide canals such as the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The report suggested that attempts to increase the commercial traffic on these canals should be made, but that they should be relegated to group 3 if the traffic did not appear. Group 3 canals, which covered all the rest, should be considered for disposal to organisations other than the British Transport Commission or closed. The group included of canal, but about one third of them were already closed, having been abandoned as a result of the LMS General Powers Act of 1945. This approach was considered by the Bowes Committee, which published their report, entitled The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Inland Waterways (Cmnd 486) in July 1958. This proposed two groups of waterways, Class A and Class B, that were similar to the groups 1 and 2 of the 1954 report, and that all other canals should be developed for purposes that did not include navigation, or should be eliminated. Organisation Amidst fears that there might be little of the canal network left unless urgent action was taken, a number of canal enthusiasts in the East Midlands formed the Inland Waterways Protection Society on 21 April 1958. It was initially a breakaway movement from the Inland Waterways Association (IWA), which at the time was undergoing radical reorganisation to become a non-profit distributing company limited by guarantee. The president was Sir Geoffrey Lowles, who was still a member of the IWA council at the time, and had opposed the reorganisation. Teddy Edwards was its waterways consultant, and Mrs Bessie Bunker of Sheffield became its secretary. She was accused by Robert Aickman, the chairman of the IWA, of being the founder of the new society, and although she rejected the idea, she did admit that it would probably not have been formed without her. By the time the Bowes Report was published in July, the IWPS was ready to Act, and immediately started to visit and review the Class C waterways, so that they would have facts to argue the case for retention, and could produce informed reports on their condition. During 1958, they succeeding in covering the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Chesterfield Canal. Reports on the Pocklington Canal, the Macclesfield Canal and the Peak Forest Canal followed in early 1959, and other canals were surveyed subsequently. In February 1959, the government admitted that the implementation of the Bowes Report would require extensive legislation, and set up the Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee (IWRAC) to assist in the redevelopment of Class C waterways. Its members included several who were sympathetic to the restoration movement, including the author Tom Rolt. In May 1959 the IWPS organised a protest cruise on the Chesterfield Canal, to try to convince the authorities that it should be retained, and in the following month presented their first report to the IWRAC. It gave detailed arguments for the restoration of the Pocklington Canal, when the Advisory Committee were considering whether it should be filled in and abandoned. Similar reports concerning the future of the Dudley Canal, the Stourbridge Canal and the Titford Branch Canal were presented to the IWRAC in August. Members also began to campaign for the Cromford Canal, with the Leawood Pump House, to be retained. Members made a survey of the Ashton Canal during the winter of 1959/60, and began inspecting the Peak Forest Canal in February 1960. This included an assessment of Bugsworth Basin, at the terminus of the canal. Together with an inspection of the Caldon Canal, this work enabled them to present reports on all three canals to IWRAC, which included detailed assessments of ways in which they might be restored both economically and successfully. A forward-looking report for a new canal route between Leeds and London, which would include parts of the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Chesterfield Canal, was presented to the IWRAC on 7 April 1960, and another protest cruise was held on the Chesterfield Canal on 30 April 1960. Despite the work of the society, and recommendations by the IWRAC that they should be retained, the British Transport Commission announced to Parliament in November 1961 that the Chesterfield Canal, the upper Erewash Canal, the Buckingham Branch and the Dudley Canal and Dudley Tunnel would be closed. Both the IWPS and the Inland Waterways Association protested. Ernest Marples, the minister of transport, stated that \\"the canals are not viable in their present form,\\" and that a proposed authority to oversee them \\"may well involve the closure of canals and their conversion or disposal if, thereby, the burden on the tax payer can be relieved.\\" As the threats to the network persisted, the initial campaigning by the IWPS was in many cases assisted by local societies representing individual waterways. Thus the Retford and Worksop Boat Club was formed in February 1962 to campaign for the Chesterfield Canal, and the Marple Residents Association worked to get Marple aqueduct repaired and the Peak Forest Canal reopened, In 1962, responsibility for the canals passed to a new body, the British Waterways Board, and the IWRAC was abolished. There was considerable debate in the House of Lords as to whether they canals were public or private rights-of-way. If they were private, like the railways, then there was only a responsibility to maintain them for the safety of the public, but if they were public, then there was a responsibility to maintain them for navigation. Ultimately, it was decided that they were public rights-of-way, and this fact was enshrined in the Transport Act 1962. Meanwhile, the IWPS continued to make tours and inspections of canals under threat. Their survey of the Chesterfield Canal in 1964 revealed significant problems at the Chesterfield end. A confectionery factory had been built over the terminal basin, the section from Killamarsh to Spinkhill bridge was dry, and High Moor lock house had been demolished and the rubble pushed into the lock chamber. It would be another three years before officials finally recognised that the canal network had a future besides use for commercial carrying. A White Paper called British Waterways: Recreation and Amenity was presented to Parliament in September 1967. The Minister for Transport, Barbara Castle, announced that the Government now realised that pleasure cruising was not a pastime confined to the rich, that the British Waterways Board would have a duty to ensure that the canals were suitable for powered pleasure boats, and that of the network would be retained. Restoration The Peak Forest Canal was one of the first canals surveyed by the newly formed IWPS. At its southern end, the canal splits into two. The line to Whaley Bridge was originally a branch, and the line to Bugsworth Basin was the main line, although this designation has now been reversed. The name of the village has been changed to Buxworth, which is supposedly more desirable, although the basin retains the original spelling. The Bugsworth line was last used for commercial traffic in 1922, and was abandoned in 1925. Since 1968, the main aims of the IWPS have been the restoration and operation of Bugsworth Basin. The society became a non-profit limited company in 1982, and the rift with the Inland Waterways Association, which resulted in the formation of the society in 1958, was resolved in 1995, when the society re-affiliated to the IWA. On 14 September 1968, the IWPS received permission from British Waterways to commence restoration of Bugsworth Basin. In 1970, the IWPS was awarded a Bronze Plaque under the Countryside Awards Scheme of the European Conservation Year. On 6 September 1975, the Entrance Basin was re-watered and boats passed into it for the first time in more than 30 years. However, the canal was found to be leaking and it had to be drained shortly afterwards. On 18 April 1982, the Entrance Basin was re-watered again to admit boats but the canal was found to be still leaking and it had to be drained once more. In November 1998, a greater area of Bugsworth Basin was re-watered and boats entered again. In April 1999 there was a celebration of the return of boats but once again the canal was found to be leaking and it had to be drained. Following an extensive geological survey of the ground, which included the drilling of core sample for analysis, DewPitchmastic commenced work on sealing the canal in December 2003. In addition to this work, GallifordTry, the omnibus contractor for British Waterways, cleared and then sealed part of the Entrance Canal, to make it watertight, as it was also leaking. The latter work was completed just in time for the Official Opening of Bugsworth Basin on Easter Saturday 2005. Following this successful opening of Bugsworth Basin, the IWPS is still working with British Waterways and others to secure the long-term future of Bugsworth Basin. The IWPS is supported by British Waterways, High Peak Borough Council Derbyshire County Council, the Inland Waterways Association, English Heritage, English Nature, the Waterways Trust, the East Midlands Development Agency, Awards for All, and the Countryside Agency.

These are the second largest Kazakhstani proven reserves after ChevronTexaco's TengizChevroil. Estimated production is of oil per day. In 2005, PetroKazakhstan was acquired by China National Petroleum Corporation and then in 2006 transferred to PetroChina. Origins - Hurricane  Formerly known as Hurricane Hydrocarbons Ltd. the company was founded in 1981 and initially operated in Western Canada. It changed to a more international focus and grew after making several major oil and gas finds in Southern Kazakhstan, in 1991 becoming a partner in a JV to develop the Kyzylkiya, Aryskum, Maibulak and South Kumkol fields. In 1996 it purchased Yuzhneftegaz from the Kazakh government, making it one of the largest players in the country. However the company ran into severe problems in the late 1990s. All the company's oil went through refineries owned by Central Asian Industrial Holdings N.V. (CAIH), a Dutch-registered offshore affiliate of Kazkommertsbank (KKB) Kazakhstan's leading banking group, which used their monopoly to charge high prices. At the same time oil prices plunged. In 1999 the company was forced into receivership and almost broken up. The company was saved by Bernard Isautier, a board member who had long been involved in the Canadian oil industry and in Central Asia. He became CEO and negotiated a merger with Central Asian Industrial Holdings N.V. From mid-October 1999 to 2000 Hurricane acquired 88.4% of OJSC Shymkentnefteorgsintez (now PetroKazakhstan Oil Products LLP) which owns the 160,000 bpd Shymkent Oil Refinery, the most modern of the country's three refineries (commissioned 1985). In doing so Isautier put 30% of Hurricane's stock in CAIH's hands.Publication: APS Review Downstream Trends - history of Shimkent refinery Date: Sunday, March 11, 2007 \\"Bernard Isautier, chairman of Hurricane, then said of the deal: \\"It was the only way to save the company\\". He admitted that the loss of a 30% stake to CAIH was \\"a very stiff price to pay\\". Hurricane was shocked again in April 2002, when CAIH announced a hostile takeover bid. CAIH's offer was for 18.4m shares of Hurricane, enough to give it control, for $6.66 a share. \\"This offer is totally inadequate. The price is extremely low\\", said Isautier, noting that an independent appraisal by J.S. Harold put the value at $11.36 per share.\\" This eventually made the investors in both companies very wealthy, especially Isautier who had demanded no salary and was at first only paid in stock options. The rapid increase in the stock's value made Isautier by far the most generously compensated executive in Canada in 2004.  Renamed PetroKazakhstan  In 2003 Hurricane was renamed PetroKazakhstan to reflect that its entire operations are in that country. In the following years Hurricane/PetroKazakhstan saw considerable conflict with the government of Kazakhstan, including a fine for anti-competitive behaviour and protests of its environmental and labour record reportedly organized by government agents. In June 2005 PetroKazakhstan announced that it had been approached for a possible takeover or merger, sending stock prices up significantly. The most frequently mentioned possible suitor was a branch of India's ONGC. The stock quickly fell back down when the government of Kazakhstan announced that it would demand the right to acquire PetroKazakhstan prior to any merger, in part because India would have to export their oil through Russia, thus increasing Kazakhstan’s dependence on Russia. CNPC and PetroChina On 21 August 2005 China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), agreed to buy the company for US$4.18 billion via CNPC International Ltd. (CNPCI), a 100% subsidiary of China National Oil & Gas Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC). This made the PetroKazakhstan deal the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company. PetroKazakhstan was delisted in Kazakhstan, Toronto, New York, London and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges. As part of the deal with CNPC, on 15 October 2005, according to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan On Subsoil Use, CNPC agreed to sell back 33% of the shares of PetroKazakhstan Inc. to KazMunaiGas (KMG), a transaction which was completed on 5 July 2006. Further on 6 July 2007 KMG bought back a 50% share in PetroKazakhstan subsidiary PetroKazakhstan Oil Products LLP [PKOP) thereby allowing the Kazakh government to regain an equal share of the nation's most modern oil refinery. In 2006 CNPC transferred its remaining 67% of shares to China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Company (CPECC), a 50/50 joint venture with its own listed subsidiary PetroChina,August 2006 CEI.gov.cn who currently manage and operate the company.PetroChina press release August 2006 See also * Shanghai Cooperation Organization - of which Kazakhstan and China are both members References External links *PetroKazazhstan company site *China Ups the Ante in Its Bid for Oil Category:Defunct oil companies Category:Oil companies of Canada Category:Oil and gas companies of Kazakhstan Category:Companies based in Calgary Category:Energy companies established in 1981 Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1981 Category:Non-renewable resource companies disestablished in 2006 Category:1981 establishments in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Category:2000s disestablishments in Kazakhstan Category:Defunct companies of Alberta Category:Defunct companies of Kazakhstan Category:Companies formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Canadian companies disestablished in 2006 Category:Canadian companies established in 1981 ","title":"PetroKazakhstan"},{"id":"2145524","title":"Setting Sons"},{"id":"2145530","text":"Michael Scanlon (also known as Sean Scanlon) is a former communications director for Rep.

Abramoff was accused and later pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges of wire fraud, stemming from a forged wire transfer showing a non-existent down payment used to obtain financing for the purchase. Scanlon and Tribal lobbying As of September 11, 2000, Scanlon was one of the lobbyists assigned to Abramoff's team lobbying on behalf of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. After Abramoff left Preston Gates and went to Greenberg Traurig in January 2001, Scanlon formed his own public relations firm, Capitol Campaign Strategies (along with the dummy organizations American International Center, Atlantic Research Analysis, and Scanlon Gould Public Affairs). Abramoff and Scanlon used the firm to bilk tribal clients for millions of dollars in fees. Abramoff directed clients to use Scanlon's firm for political campaign services, without disclosing his own relationship with Scanlon. Scanlon's firm would then only perform part of the campaign services billed for, and would split the excess money received with Abramoff in a scheme known to the two as \\"Gimme Five\\". Private communications revealed as a result of the Congressional enquiry into Scanlon and Abramoff's consulting business demonstrate a contemptuous attitude to both clients and supporters. Indian Clients were referred to as \\"troglodytes\\" and \\"monkeys\\", while Christian Conservatives were called gullible \\"wackos\\" who could be manipulated to vote on demand: Scanlon also emailed colleagues, saying: Criminal charges On November 18, 2005, in a one-count criminal information filed by the US Justice Department, Scanlon was charged with conspiring with another lobbyist, who was identified only as \\"Lobbyist A\\", believed to be Abramoff. That same day Scanlon agreed to testify against Abramoff in any future criminal case involving his ex-partner. On November 21, 2005, in proceedings before Federal District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress and other public officials. Under the plea agreement, Scanlon will repay $19.6 million to his former Indian tribe lobbying clients. Fictional portrayals Scanlon was portrayed by Barry Pepper in the 2010 film Casino Jack.

A deal with the devil (also known as a pact with the devil) is a cultural motif in European folklore, best exemplified by the legend of Faust and the figure of Mephistopheles, as well as being elemental to many Christian traditions. According to traditional Christian belief about witchcraft, the pact is between a person and Satan or a lesser demon. The person offers their soul in exchange for diabolical favours. Those favours vary by the tale, but tend to include youth, knowledge, wealth, fame, or power. It was also believed that some people made this type of pact just as a sign of recognising the minion as their master, in exchange for nothing. Nevertheless, the bargain is considered a dangerous one, as the price of the Fiend's service is the wagerer's soul. The tale may have a moralising end, with eternal damnation for the foolhardy venturer. Conversely, it may have a comic twist, in which a wily peasant outwits the devil, characteristically on a technical point. The person making the pact sometimes tries to outwit the devil, but loses in the end (e.g., man sells his soul for eternal life because he will never die to pay his end of the bargain. Immune to the death penalty, he commits murder, but is sentenced to life in prison). Great achievements might be credited to a pact with the devil, from the numerous European Devil's Bridges to the violin virtuosity of Giuseppe Tartini and Niccolò Paganini to the \\"crossroad\\" myth associated with Robert Johnson. The \\"Bargain with the devil\\" constitutes motif number M210 and \\"Man sells soul to devil\\" motif number M211 in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature.Stith Thompson, Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, 2nd ed. (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1955-58), vol. 5, pp. 39-40. Synopsis Saint Wolfgang and the Devil (1471-1475) by Michael Pacher. It was usually thought that the person who had made a pact also promised the demon to kill children or consecrate them to the devil at the moment of birth (many midwives were accused of this, due to the number of children who died at birth in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance), take part in Witches' Sabbaths, have sexual relations with demons, and sometimes engender children from a succubus, or an incubus in the case of women. The pact can be either oral or written.McNeill, Brian. \\"Dealing with the Devil: Professor Explores Contracts with the Prince of Darkness in Popular Culture\\", University of Virginia, School of Law, July 26, 2012 An oral pact may be made by means of invocations, conjurations, or rituals to attract the demon; once the conjurer thinks the demon is present, he/she asks for the wanted favour and offers his/her soul in exchange, and no evidence is left of the pact. But according to some witch trials, even the oral pact left evidence, the Witches' mark, an indelible mark where the marked person had been touched by the devil to seal the pact. The mark could be used as a proof to determine that the pact was made. It was also believed that on the spot where the mark was left, the marked person could feel no pain. A written pact consists in the same forms of attracting the demon, but includes a written act, usually signed with the conjurer's blood (although sometimes it was also alleged that the whole act had to be written with blood; meanwhile some demonologists defended the idea of using red ink instead of blood and others suggested the use of animal blood instead of human blood). These acts were presented often as a proof of diabolical pacts, though critics claim there is no proof of whether they were authentic, written by insane persons believing they were actually dealing with a demon, or just were fake acts presented by the tribunals. Usually the acts included strange characters that were said to be the signature of a demon, and each one had his own signature or seal. Books like The Lesser Key of Solomon (also known as Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis) give a detailed list of these signs, known as diabolical signatures. The Malleus Maleficarum discusses several alleged instances of pacts with the Devil, especially concerning women. It was considered that all witches and warlocks had made a pact with one of the demons, usually Satan. According to demonology, there is a specific month, day of the week, and hour to call each demon, so the invocation for a pact has to be done at the right time. Also, as each demon has a specific function, a certain demon is invoked depending on what the conjurer is going to ask. In the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus is offered a series of bargains by the devil, in which he is promised worldly riches and glory in exchange for serving the devil rather than God. After Jesus rejects the devil's offers, he embarks on his travels as the Messiah.Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13 (see Temptations of Christ). Theophilus of Adana, servant of two masters The predecessor of Faustus in Christian mythology is Theophilus (\\"Friend of God\\" or \\"Beloved of God\\") the unhappy and despairing cleric, disappointed in his worldly career by his bishop, who sells his soul to the devil but is redeemed by the Virgin Mary. His story appears in a Greek version of the 6th century written by a \\"Eutychianus\\" who claims to have been a member of the household in question. A 9th-century Miraculum Sancte Marie de Theophilo penitente inserts a Virgin as intermediary with diabolus, his \\"patron\\", providing the prototype of a closely linked series in the Latin literature of the West.Representative examples of the Latin tradition were analysed by Moshe Lazar, \\"Theophilus: Servant of Two Masters. The Pre-Faustian Theme of Despair and Revolt\\" in Modern Language Notes 87.6, (Nathan Edelman Memorial Issue November 1972) pp. 31–50. In the 10th century, the poet nun Hroswitha of Gandersheim adapted the text of Paulus Diaconus for a narrative poem that elaborates Theophilus' essential goodness and internalizes the seduction of good and evil, in which the devil is magus, a necromancer. As in her model, Theophilus receives back his contract from the devil, displays it to the congregation, and soon dies. A long poem on the subject by Gautier de Coincy (1177/8–1236), entitled Le miracle de Théophile: ou comment Théophile vint à la pénitence provided material for a 13th-century play by Rutebeuf, Le Miracle de Théophile, where Theophilus is the central pivot in a frieze of five characters, the Virgin and the bishop flanking him on the side of good, the Jew and the devil on the side of evil.  Alleged diabolical pacts in history  Urbain Grandier's alleged diabolical pact Pope Sylvester II and the devil in an illustration of c. 1460. * An extensive legend of a supposed devilish pact was focused on the character of Pope Sylvester II (946–1003), a prominent and skilled scholar and scientist in his lifetime, who had studied mathematics and astrology in the then Muslim-occupied cities of Córdoba and Seville. According to the legend, spread by William of Malmesbury and Cardinal Beno, Sylvester II had also learned sorcery, using a book of spells stolen from an Arab philosopher.Brian A. Catlos, Infidel Kings and Unholy Warriors (New York, NY: Farrar, Straus And Giroux, 2014), 83. He had a pact with a female demon called Meridiana, who appeared after he had been rejected by his earthly love, and with whose help he managed to ascend to the papal throne (another legend tells that he won the papacy by playing dice with the devil). * The Icelandic priest and scholar Sæmundur Sigfússon (1056–1133) was credited in Icelandic folklore with having made pacts with the devil and managing by various tricks to get the better of the deal. For example, in one famous story Sæmundur made a pact with the devil that the devil should bring him home to Iceland from Europe on the back of a seal. Sæmundur escaped a diabolical end when, on arrival, he hit the seal on the head with the Bible, killing it, and stepping safely ashore.Gísli Sigurðsson, 'Icelandic National Identity: From Romanticism to Tourism', in Making Europe in Nordic Contexts, ed. by Pertti J. Anttonen, NIF Publications, 35 (Turku: Nordic Institute of Folklore, University of Turku, 1996), pp. 41–76 (p. 52). (see Sæmundr fróði#Icelandic folklore). * According to a medieval legend associated with the Codex Gigas, the scribe was a monk who broke his monastic vows and was sentenced to be walled up alive. In order to avoid this harsh penalty he promised to create in one night a book to glorify the monastery forever, including all human knowledge. Near midnight, he became sure that he could not complete this task alone so he made a special prayer, not addressed to God but to the fallen angel Lucifer, asking him to help him finish the book in exchange for his soul. The devil completed the manuscript and the monk added the devil's picture out of gratitude for his aid. * Notable supposed deals with the devil were struck between the 15th and 18th centuries. The motif lives on among musicians until the 20th century: * Johann Georg Faust (1466/80 – 1541), whose life was the origin of the Faust legend. * John Fian (executed on January 27, 1591), A doctor and school teacher who was declared as a notorious sorcerer. He confessed to have a compact with Satan during the North Berwick witch trials in Scotland which he confessed to King James as the trial proceedings were taking place but later promised that he would renounce his compact with Satan and vow to lead the life of a Christian. The next morning, he confessed that the devil came to him in his cell dressed all in black and holding a white wand, demanding Fian continue his faithful service, according to his first oath and promise that he made. Fian testified that he renounced Satan to his face saying \\"Get thee behind me, thou Satan, and start pushing, for I have listened too much to thee, and by the same thou hast undone me, in respect whereof I will utterly undo you.\\" He confessed that the devil then answered \\"That once ere thou die thou shall be mine.\\" The devil afterwards broke the white wand, and immediately vanished from his sight. He then was given a chance to lead the life he promised but the same night he stole a key to his cell and escaped. He was eventually captured and tortured until his execution. * Urbain Grandier (1590 – 1634), 17th-century French priest, who was tried and burned at the stake for witchcraft. One of the documents presented at his trial was a diabolical pact he supposedly signed, which also bears what are supposed to be the seals of several demons, including that of Satan himself. * Christoph Haizmann (1651/2 – 1700), 17th-century painter from Bavaria, allegedly signed two pacts to be a \\"bounden son\\" to the devil in 1668. * Bernard Fokke, 17th- century captain for the Dutch East India Company, renowned for his uncanny speed from the Dutch Republic to Java, which led to legends that he was in league with the devil. He is also alleged to be the model for the ghostly captain of the Flying Dutchman.Eyers, Jonathan (2011), Don't Shoot the Albatross! Nautical Myths and Superstitions, A&C; Black, * Jonathan Moulton (1726 – 1787), 18th-century brigadier general of the New Hampshire Militia, alleged to have sold his soul to the devil to have his boots filled with gold coins when hung by the fireplace every month. *Giuseppe Tartini (8 April 1692 – 26 February 1770), Venetian violinist and composer, who believed that his Devil's Trill Sonata was inspired by the devil's appearance before him in a dream. *Niccolò Paganini (27 October 1782 – 27 May 1840), Italian violinist, who may not have started the rumour but played along with it. *Philippe Musard (1793 – 1859), French composer and, more importantly, orchestra leader, whose wild conducting and sensuous concerts generated the rumor while a celebrity in Paris in the 1830s. *Tommy Johnson (1896 – 1 November 1956), blues musician. *Robert Johnson (8 May 1911 – 16 August 1938), blues musician, who legend claims met Satan at a crossroads and signed over his soul to play the blues and gain mastery of the guitar. Metaphorical use of the term The term \\"a pact with the devil\\" (or \\"Faustian bargain\\") is also used metaphorically to condemn a person or persons perceived as having collaborated with an evil person or regime. An example of this is the Nazi-Jewish negotiations during the Holocaust, both positively and negatively. Under Jewish law, the principle of pikuach nefesh (\\"saving life\\") is an obligation to compromise one's principles in order to preserve human life. However, Rudolf Kastner was accused of negotiating with the Nazis to save a select few at the expense of the many. According to some, the term served to inflame public hatred against Kastner, culminating in his assassination.

The film was written by Stevan Bulajić and Veljko Bulajić, and directed by Veljko Bulajić. It is based on the true events of World War II. The Battle of the Neretva was due to a strategic plan for a combined Axis powers attack in 1943 against the Yugoslav Partisans. The plan was also known as the Fourth Enemy Offensive and occurred in the area of the Neretva river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Battle of Neretva is the most expensive motion picture made in the SFR Yugoslavia.Bitka na Neretvi It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the year after Sergei Bondarchuk (playing the role of Martin in Neretva) won the honour for War and Peace. The score for the English-speaking versions was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Its soundtrack was released by Entr'acte Recording Society in 1974. It was re-released on Southern Cross Records on CD. One of the original posters for the English version of the movie was made by Pablo Picasso, which, according to Bulajić, the famous painter agreed to do without payment, only requesting a case of the best Yugoslav wines.

Battle of Neretva was the first of a series of huge state-sponsored World War II film productions. It had a staggering budget approved by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. Different sources put it anywhere between $4.5 million and $12 million. Global stars such as Sergei Bondarchuk, Yul Brynner, Franco Nero, Orson Welles, etc. flocked to communist Yugoslavia attracted by the huge sums of money being offered. Shot over 16 months with funds put up in largest part by over 58 self-managed companies in Yugoslavia, the movie featured a combined battalion of 10,000 Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) soldiers. Four villages and a fortress were constructed for the film and destroyed. Several JNA-inventory Soviet T-34 tanks, touched up to look like German Panzers, met the same fate. A railway bridge over the Neretva in Jablanica was destroyed. Director Bulajić's justification for demolishing the bridge rather than getting the shots in studio was that it would become a tourist attraction. The bridge was thus blown but because none of the footage was usable due to the billowing smoke that made it impossible to see anything, it was decided that the bridge should be repaired and destroyed again. The problem with the excessive smoke occurred again and the scenes of the bridge being blown up in the film were shot using a table-size replica at a sound stage in Prague. The Yugoslav public was updated on the shooting progress via pieces in the country's print media.Glumci na služenju vojske!;Plavi vjesnik, July 1968Najveći honorari Bati i Ljubiši!;Plavi vjesnik, July 1968 Reception Sergei Bondarchuk and Orson Welles at the premiere in Sarajevo on 29 November 1969.

Junior hockey leagues in the United States and Canada are considered amateur (with some exceptions) and operate within regions of each country. In Canada, the highest level is major junior, and is governed by the Canadian Hockey League, which itself has three constituent leagues: the Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and the Western Hockey League. The second tier is Junior A, governed nationally by the Canadian Junior Hockey League and is composed of several regional leagues. In the United States, the top level is Tier I, represented by the United States Hockey League. Tier II is represented by the North American Hockey League. There are several Tier III and independently sanctioned leagues throughout the country. A limited number of teams in the Canadian major junior leagues are also based in the United States. In Europe, junior teams are often sponsored by professional teams, and act as development and feeder associations for those organizations. In Canada, junior hockey is one level above minor ice hockey, the level of ice hockey played by youth. It is often called \\"youth hockey\\" in the United States, so as to not to be confused with minor league professional hockey. Canada Junior hockey in Canada is broken into several tiers, and players aged 16–20 at the beginning of the season are eligible. Hockey Canada is enacting rules designed to limit the number of 16-year-olds allowed to play junior hockey, preferring most remain at the midget level. =Major junior= Major junior hockey is overseen by the Canadian Hockey League (CHL), which acts as the governing body for its three constituent leagues: *Quebec Major Junior Hockey League - operating in Quebec and Atlantic Canada with 18 teams *Ontario Hockey League - operating in Ontario, Pennsylvania, and Michigan with 20 teams *Western Hockey League - operating in Western Canada, Washington, and Oregon with 22 teams The CHL currently places a cap of three 20-year-old-or-over players per team, commonly known as \\"overage players\\". The CHL also allows up to four 16-year-olds on each roster. While fifteen-year-old players were formerly permitted to play a limited number of games per season at the CHL level, they are now permitted to play only if they are deemed exceptional by the CHL. , seven players have qualified under this rule: centre John Tavares in 2005, defenceman Aaron Ekblad in 2011, centre Connor McDavid in 2012, defenceman Sean Day in 2013, centre Joe Veleno in 2015, centre Shane Wright in 2019, and forward Connor Bedard in 2020. CHL teams are currently permitted two \\"imports\\" (players from outside Canada or the US, generally from Europe or Russia) each, though this cap is expected to be reduced to one within a couple of seasons. Due to paying players stipends and allowing junior players that have signed entry-level contracts with the NHL, all CHL teams are considered professional by the NCAA; thus any player who plays a game at the Major Junior level loses his eligibility to play for universities in the United States. The player retains eligibility for Canadian universities however, and all three leagues have programs in place to grant scholarships for any player who plays in these leagues provided he does not turn professional once their junior career ends. Many of the National Hockey League’s (NHL) top prospects play in the CHL. The champion of each league competes in an annual tournament with a predetermined host team for the Memorial Cup, Canada's national major junior championship. Up until 1970, the leagues that were classified as Major Junior and \\"Junior A\\" today were both part of Junior A. In 1970 they were divided into \\"Tier I Junior A\\" or \\"Major Junior A\\" and \\"Tier II Junior A\\". In 1980, the three Major Junior A leagues opted for self-control over being controlled by the branches of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and became Major Junior hockey, Tier II Junior A became the top tier of hockey in the CAHA and became Junior A hockey. =Junior A= Junior A (junior AAA in Quebec) hockey is one level below the CHL. Junior A was referred to as Tier II Junior A in the 1970s, until what was called Major Junior A broke away from their regional branches in 1980 and formed the Canadian Hockey League, becoming Major Junior hockey. At that time, the term Tier II was dropped from what is now Junior A hockey. It is governed by the Canadian Junior Hockey League, which oversees eleven constituent leagues across Canada. The national championship is the Centennial Cup. Junior A teams are considered amateur by the NCAA, thus players intending to go to American universities tend to choose this route rather than play in the CHL. Junior A teams tend to play in much smaller markets than CHL teams, and thus play to smaller crowds. =Junior B, C, D= Junior B (junior AA in Quebec) was created in 1933, to differentiate between teams eligible for Memorial Cup competition and those who were not. The major championships across Canada are the Sutherland Cup in Southern Ontario, the Barkley Cup in the Ottawa District, the Coupe Dodge in Quebec, the Don Johnson Cup in the Atlantic Provinces, and the Keystone Cup which represents all of Western Canada, from British Columbia to Northwestern Ontario. Junior C (junior A in Quebec) generally consists of local competitions, but is considered competitive in some regions, and serve as seeding or farm-teams for Junior B teams. Ontario Junior C Hockey has 6 rounds of best-of-seven playoffs (up to 42 games per team) for the Clarence Schmalz Cup which was first awarded in 1938. The Ontario Junior C playoffs are played for between 6 of the Province's 7 different regional leagues. In Quebec and West of Manitoba, Junior C hockey tends to be an extension of the local minor hockey system and is sometimes called Juvenile or House League. In Ontario, Manitoba, and the Maritimes, Junior C is run independently of minor hockey systems, though with the same mostly recreational purpose. Junior D was popular in the 1960s and 1970s in dense population centers, but fell off in the early 1990s. In Quebec, Junior D is now known as Junior B and is run strictly by minor hockey associations. The last Junior D league was the OHA's Southern Ontario Junior Hockey League, the result of the merger of the Northern, Western, and Southern Junior D leagues in the late 1980s. The SOJHL moved to Junior C league in 2012. United States As in Canada, junior hockey in the United States is subdivided into several levels with most being sanctioned by USA Hockey. Currently, 13 American teams play in the Canadian junior system, with eight in the Canadian Hockey League and five in junior A leagues. The CHL includes four teams in Washington and one in Oregon in the Western Hockey League, and two teams in Michigan and one in Pennsylvania in the Ontario Hockey League. At junior A level, two teams in the Superior International Junior Hockey League are in Minnesota and Wisconsin, one team in the British Columbia Hockey League is from Washington, one in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League is from Michigan, and one in the Ontario Junior Hockey League is from New York. =Tier I= The United States Hockey League (USHL) is currently the only Tier I league in the country, consisting of teams in the central and midwestern United States. The USHL provides an alternative to major junior hockey for kids who want to play in the NCAA before entering a professional league such as the NHL. While playing in the USHL, all player expenses are paid for by the team; no membership or equipment fees are charged. Unlike major junior teams, the professional leagues draft significantly less directly from the USHL teams and the free-college stipend does not exist. For most of its existence the USHL was considered inferior in quality of play to the major junior levels. But it continued to improve and as of 2019 about 21% of NHL players had played USHL in their career. Between 80 and 90 percent of USHL players continued into NCAA hockey, with 33% advancing to the NHL as of 2019. =Tier II= Currently, the North American Hockey League is the only USA Hockey-sanctioned Tier II league in the United States. The NAHL consists of teams spread across the western two thirds of the United States with a significant concentration of teams in the central and southwestern parts of the United States, although the league began to expand to east coast as of 2015. In October 2016, the Tier III United States Premier Hockey League, a league predominately located on the east coast, applied to USA Hockey for approval of a Tier II league to begin in the 2017–18 season, however, the league was denied that December and decided to operate its Tier II league independently. The NAHL, like the USHL, provides young players an alternative to major junior hockey, although the skill level is considered significantly lower than major junior hockey and typically filled with those who would not or did not make the roster of a Tier I team. Unlike Tier I, the NAHL does not pay for all players' expenses, such as room and board, but there is no tuition cost to the player as in Tier III. =Tier III = In addition to paying for room and board, players at the Tier III level pay a fee or tuition, commonly ranging from $4,000 to $9,500. This is for all accounts and purposes an amateur level, although some players go directly to NCAA Division I schools. Most Tier III players are looking to increase their skills in hopes to move up to Tier I or II, while other players go directly to NCAA Division III, ACHA and CHF schools. Prior to July 2011, USA Hockey split Tier III into Junior A and B divisions. USA Hockey currently has three sanctioned Tier III leagues: * Eastern Hockey League – two divisions (EHL and EHL Premier) * North American 3 Hockey League  Independent leagues (Canada and US)  Some leagues that refer to themselves as Junior A also operate outside the control of the Hockey Canada and USA Hockey, typically due to restrictions from the governing bodies over player recruitment and finances. While a league can claim to be comparable to Junior A leagues, due to the lack of regulation the actual level of play may vary. In addition to independent leagues, there are also independent teams, such as the Jamestown Jets, although these usually result from league problems or other disputes. These leagues are often referred to as \\"outlaw\\" leagues due to their lack of sanctioning or oversight from an outside governing body. = AAU = The Amateur Athletic Union returned to sanctioning the sport of ice hockey in 2011. Prior to the 2011–12 season, the Western States Hockey League became the first large-scale junior league to exit USA Hockey in favor of the AAU. In 2012, the AAU formed the United Hockey Union for managing its hockey leagues and held a championship tournament in 2013 and 2014. Currently all junior hockey leagues under the UHU umbrella operate under a similar pay-to-play USA Hockey Tier III and Hockey Canada's Junior A structure, although the WSHL is considered Tier II within the UHU hierarchy. The UHU announced that starting in 2017 it would launch a free-to-play Tier I league called the Central One Hockey League; however, plans for the league were later called off and the people behind the C1HL launched the non-sanctioned USA Central Hockey League in 2018. One of the main reasons that some teams and leagues have chosen the AAU is for the looser player import restrictions. In most USA Hockey sanctioned leagues, each team is limited to a maximum of four non-US citizen players (with a loophole for non-US citizens that have been registered USA Hockey members for three seasons). However, under AAU sanctioning, teams may have up to 14 non-North American players (meaning players from Canada and the United States are not counted as imports in either country). The increased import limit has led to more competitive teams where it was more difficult to recruit local talent. It also allows more European players opportunities to play in the junior level of North American hockey leagues that would be normally be limited under Hockey Canada and USA Hockey restrictions.  UHU junior leagues  * Canadian Premier Junior Hockey League * Western States Hockey League – Tier II status =Self sanctioned leagues= Other leagues have their own guidelines for team and player restrictions with no outside oversight by a governing body. Since 2006, the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League has operated as an independent league in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. The league widely recruits players from outside of North America. In late 2016, the United States Premier Hockey League, an organization composed of several USA Hockey Tier III junior as well as many youth hockey leagues, applied for a Tier II league. The Tier II status was denied in December 2016 but the USPHL moved forward with the new league anyway, creating the National Collegiate Development Conference. In response, the USPHL has removed all their junior level leagues (the NCDC and the Tier III-level Premier and Elite Divisions) from USA Hockey sanctioning since the 2017–18 season. Europe Russia vs. United States at the alt=In-game action photo In Europe, junior teams are usually associated with a professional team, and are used by professional teams to develop their own prospects. One example of this is the J20 SuperElit league in Sweden or the Minor Hockey League in Russia. Such leagues are sometimes dubbed major junior hockey leagues. The lack of an amateur draft in Europe means that the onus is on the teams to sign the most talented young players they can get, and the presence of an affiliated junior team provides a place for young players who are not yet ready for the rigours of the professional game to develop. However, not all players on a European junior team are necessarily the property of their professional club, and may elect to sign elsewhere. At the World Hockey Summit in 2010, nations in Europe expressed concern about the number of junior players leaving to play in North America, despite the improved talent level and the increasing popularity of the IIHF Ice Hockey World Junior Championships. Slavomir Lener, a director with the Czech Ice Hockey Association, felt that junior-aged players were enticed to play in North America before maturation, with had a negative effect on the development of the player and the European system. He stated that of the 527 Czech Republic players who went to North American junior hockey, only 22 of them played more than 400 NHL games. He sought to establish a European system that was competitive enough to deter players from entering into the CHL Import Draft.

Its flights were operated by other local airlines. History The airline was established in 2003 and started operations on 2 October 2003. It was created by the Argentinian government after Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas (LAPA) folded. It was owned by the Federal planning ministry (40%), ministry of economy (40%) and Intercargo (20%). This airline was created in 2003 to absorb the workers of two small bankrupt private airlines, LAPA and Dinar Líneas Aéreas. The company does not actually have any planes of its own. Later on it helped Southern Winds Airlines, another private carrier, to keep afloat by providing its routes and staff in exchange for using Southern Winds' fleet. Southern Winds continued to fly under their colours. Yet another Argentine airline, Aerovip, was also absorbed over those same years. In March 2005, the Chilean flagship airline LAN Airlines reached an agreement with the Argentine government to absorb all workers at Argentina's state carrier LAFSA. LAN took over LAFSA's routes and agreed to help Southern Winds for at least 90 days as well. It was at this point that LAN Argentina began. Since then, Southern Winds has completely disappeared with LAN Argentina replacing LAFSA and Southern Winds. The remarkable fact is that LAFSA never had any airplanes, but it would keep the structure that was not absorbed by LAN Argentina,Diego Cabot, \\"Insólito: Lafsa, que nunca voló en 9 años, sigue pagando sueldos\\", La Nación, 12 May 2012 (in Spanish). even with people in charge with clients, a marketing manager, pilots and copilots.

Lying in repose differs from the more formal honor of lying in state, which is generally held at the principal government building of the deceased person's country and often accompanied by a guard of honour. United States In the United States of America, \\"lying in state\\" is generally considered to be when one's body is placed in the rotunda of the United States Capitol. When the deceased person is placed in another location, like the Great Hall of the Supreme Court, they lie in repose, as was the case following the deaths of Justices Antonin Scalia in February 2016 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September 2020. The remains of presidents who die in office generally lie in repose in the East Room of the White House while those of a deceased former president generally lie in repose in his home state. However, as an example to the contrary, when the body of John F. Kennedy lay in repose, the term meant \\"private\\" as opposed to a public lying in state. The body of Babe Ruth lay in repose in Yankee Stadium. The body of singer Israel Kamakawiwo'ole lay in repose in the state capital building of Hawaii in 1997. Not everyone eligible to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda does so. For instance, the body of former President Richard Nixon lay in repose at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California, Senator Edward Kennedy's body lay in repose at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, and Senator Robert Byrd's body lay in repose in the Senate chamber at the Capitol. Canada In Canada, when deceased governors general and prime ministers lie anywhere outside of the Centre Block of Parliament Hill, they lie in repose. In the Hall of Honour, the Senate, or the foyer of the House of Commons, they lie in state. At the provincial, territorial or local levels, current and former politicians may lie in state or repose in government buildings.

They formed in 1978 in Whitley Bay, England, and were active until 1987. The band reformed in 1999 and continue to record and perform. The name is derived from Pan Tang, a fictional archipelago in Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melniboné fantasy series whose wizards keep tigers as pets. Biography =Early days, 1978–1983= The Tygers of Pan Tang were formed by guitarist Robb Weir (born Robert Mortimer Weir, 1958), Richard \\"Rocky\\" Laws (bass), Jess Cox (vocals) and Brian Dick (drums). They played in working men's clubs and were first signed by local independent label Neat Records before MCA gave them a major record deal. After several singles, they released their first album, Wild Cat, in 1980. The album reached No. 18 in the UK Album Chart in the first week of its release. Subsequently John Sykes (formerly of Streetfighter, later in Badlands, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, and Blue Murder) was added as second guitarist. Jess Cox had a falling out with the others and quit, to be replaced by Persian Risk vocalist Jon Deverill. This lineup released Spellbound in 1981. Sykes quit after the release of the third album, Crazy Nights, to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's band. He was replaced by ex-Penetration guitarist Fred Purser, who had to learn the set in two days before touring. Tygers of Pan Tang's fourth album, The Cage, was released in 1982. The band then had a dispute with MCA, who were reluctant to promote the band unless they agreed to record more cover versions (following the band's hit with \\"Love Potion No. 9\\"). The band tried to terminate their contract, but MCA's release terms exceeded what other record companies were willing to pay to acquire the band. In frustration, the group chose to disband. Jess Cox released his solo album Third Step in 1983. John Sykes later achieved success with Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake. Songs for a new album were demoed by the same line-up which completed the previous album. It was supposed to be called Square One. The label did not approve the material and, in consequence this line-up disbanded. Songs from this aborted album were issued in 2018 under the name Purser Deverill. =Reformation, 1985–1987= In 1985, Jon Deverill and Brian Dick reformed the band with Steve Lamb (formerly of Sergeant) on guitar, Neil Sheppard on guitar, and ex-Warrior, ex-Satan member Clin Irwin on bass. Dave Donaldson later replaced Clin Irwin. Meanwhile, Robb Weir and Jess Cox formed the spin-off band Tyger-Tyger. The reformed Tygers of Pan Tang released The Wreck-Age in summer 1985 through Music for Nations, and Burning in the Shade in 1987, through Zebra Records. Burning in the Shade received poor reviews and they disbanded again. Various compilations and live albums were produced by the band's two first labels, Neat Records and MCA. =Latter days, 1999–present= During the 1998 Wacken Open Air festival, Jess Cox joined on stage with Blitzkrieg, playing three old Tygers songs. The audience's response was positive, and a year later, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tygers of Pan Tang and the 10th Wacken Open Air, the band was invited to play on the main stage. Brian Dick and Rocky were unable to join the band, but the Tygers (now Jess Cox and Robb Weir, backed up by Blitzkrieg guitarist Glenn S Howes, bassist Gavin Gray, and drummer Chris Percy) did perform. Recordings of their performance resulted in the Live at Wacken album. In 2000, Robb Weir reformed the band as the only original member. The other musicians were Tony Liddell (vocals), Dean Robertson (lead guitar), Brian West (bass), and Craig Ellis (drums). They released Mystical through Z-Records. They toured in several festivals, but eventually were dropped by Z-Records in 2002, due to poor record sales. The band went on to produce the split album The Second Wave: 25 Years of NWOBHM with Girlschool and Oliver/Dawson Saxon on Communique Records, and in 2004 released Noises in the Cathouse with new singer Richie Wicks who although a singer by trade was at the time still playing bass in Angel Witch. Later that year, Richie Wicks left and was replaced by Italian vocalist Jacopo Meille. Wicks later joined Shadowkeep, appearing on their 2008 album The Hourglass Effect, before leaving in 2009. As of 2010, he was the vocalist in Heavenly Hell, a Dio-era Black Sabbath tribute band, and in 2013 he commenced fronting the band Black, White & Purple with fellow ex-Angel Witch guitarist Keith Herzberg and current Praying Mantis drummer Gary MacKenzie, along with Shadowkeep's ex-bassist Mark Fielden. Jon Deverill went on to work as an actor under the name of Jon De Ville, and as of October 2007 was performing in 'The Sound of Music' at the London Palladium with television star Connie Fisher. In October 2007, the band issued a limited edition five track EP titled Back and Beyond, which featured reworkings of three Tygers songs from the early 1980s, along with two new tracks taken from their forthcoming album. Animal Instinct was released on 19 May 2008, the first with vocalist Jacopo Meille. On 2011 bassist Gavin Gray return in the band to replace Brian West. On 15 July 2011 it was announced that Tygers Of Pan Tang have signed an agreement with Rocksector Records for the worldwide release of their next studio album, with a current working title of \\"Ambush\\", provisionally planned for February/March 2012. The album came out on 24 September. In January 2013, the band announced via their official website that guitarist Dean Robertson had left the band, and that they had begun the search for a replacement. The following month, the band announced Micky Crystal as their new guitarist. In 2015, Jess Cox formed “Jess Cox’s Tygers of Pan Tang” and made festival appearances across Europe, as well as a tour of South America. In April 2020, it was announced that Micky Crystal had left the band. Shortly after, an interview emerged online where Crystal stated he had left due to poor management and that he was being used to write songs, claiming that Robb Weir had little, to no involvement, in the band's 2019 album, Ritual. He also went on to quote John Sykes, who had also expressed similar feelings after he had left the band. In May 2020, the band announced via Facebook that they would be holding auditions for a new guitarist. In July 2020, the band announced via its official website that it would be releasing a remaster of its 2012 album Ambush, to be released via Mighty Music later that year.

Lowenstern is based in Brooklyn, New York. In his early years, he performed in various ensembles representing a wide range of musical genres, including The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Steve Reich and Musicians, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, The Klezmatics, John Zorn, and Billband. In 1991 he won the second prize at the International Gaudeamus Competition in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He has created well over 40 compositions for bass clarinet, both solo and with electronics. His works explore the possibilities of large ensembles of bass clarinets (done by multi-tracking), live looping using Cycling 74's Max software (of which he was an early beta tester in 1990) and, more recently, Ableton Live. His style has evolved from his early years of \\"academic\\" electronic classical music into popular idioms, including funk, jazz and pop. Between October 2006 and January 2012, a segment of his playing with Billband has been used as the theme for the National Public Radio segment \\"Science Out of the Box,\\" which airs on the Weekend All Things Considered program. He has been a featured guest on the In C episode of RadioLab, two episodes of The Clarineat podcast, and numerous other radio and podcast interviews. He is affiliated with Vandoren and Selmer, the latter of whom developed a custom all-black bass clarinet in partnership with Lowenstern in 2015. Lowenstern holds degrees from the Eastman School of Music, an Artist's Certificate from the Sweelinck Conservatorium Amsterdam, and an M.M. and D.M.A. from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In 1989, he received a Fulbright grant to study in Amsterdam with bass clarinet virtuoso Harry Sparnaay. In addition to Sparnaay, Lowenstern's teachers have included Charles Neidich, Richard MacDowell, and John Bruce Yeh. Lowenstern has, in the past, served on the faculties of New York University and the Juilliard School, and is now on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music, teaching bass clarinet in their Contemporary Performance Program. He served as bass clarinetist of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra from 1999 until his retirement from orchestral playing in 2005. He appears on over sixty CDs, including seven solo recordings. Michael's website, earspasm, has been an online resource for bass clarinetists since 1997. While initially a promotional website for Lowenstern's music and performing career, it now features an online shop and a popular Dear Abby mailbag, where Lowenstern answers clarinet and bass clarinet players' questions. Since 2011, Lowenstern has been producing educational videos on YouTube, and has over 150 in his catalog on the platform. A few of his videos have created some controversy in the clarinet world, and he is often the subject of intense debate on the long-established Clarinet Pages of Woodwind.org References External links * Earspasm Music *YouTube Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Bass clarinetists Category:American male composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:Musicians from Chicago Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:Manhattan School of Music faculty Category:Contemporary classical music performers Category:Stony Brook University alumni Category:21st-century clarinetists Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Michael Lowenstern"},{"id":"2145582","text":"A Stolen Life is a 1946 American drama film starring Bette Davis, who also produced it. The film, based on the 1935 novel \\"A Stolen Life\\" by Karel Josef Benes, and was directed by Curtis Bernhardt. Among the supporting cast are Glenn Ford, Dane Clark, Peggy Knudsen, Charlie Ruggles, and Bruce Bennett. The movie is a remake of a 1939 British film Stolen Life starring Elisabeth Bergner and Michael Redgrave. It was nominated for Best Special Effects (William C. McGann; Special Audible Effects by Nathan Levinson) at the 19th Academy Awards, but lost to Blithe Spirit. The second time Davis played twin sisters was in Dead Ringer (1964). Plot Kate Bosworth (Bette Davis) is a sincere, demure artist who misses her boat to an island off New England, where she intends to meet her twin sister Patricia (also Davis) and her cousin Freddie (Charlie Ruggles). She persuades Bill Emerson (Glenn Ford) to take her home in his boat. Later, their relationship grows while she paints a portrait of Eben Folger (Walter Brennan), the old lighthouse keeper, and Kate is very much in love. However, her sister Pat, a flamboyant, man-hungry manipulator, fools Bill when she first meets him pretending to be Kate. Pat then pursues him on a trip out of town, and when they return, they announce to Kate their intention to marry. A heartbroken Kate focuses on her work with a rude but very talented artist named Karnock (Dane Clark), but rejects his romantic overtures. Bill eventually goes to Chile, allowing Kate to spend some time with her sister, whom she hasn't seen since the marriage. When the two go sailing, a sudden storm washes Pat overboard and she drowns, her wedding ring coming off in Kate's hands while trying to save her. Kate passes out and is washed ashore in the boat. When she regains consciousness, she is mistaken for Pat. Bill is about to return, so Kate decides to assume her late sister's identity. To her surprise, she learns that Bill is angry at Pat for her many affairs and in no mood to continue the marriage. Cousin Freddie has guessed the truth and insists that Kate must reveal to Bill her real identity. When she does, Bill realizes that Kate is the one he truly loves.

It is in the Dublin 7 postal district. History James Collins' 1913 book Life in Old Dublin notes that \\"Centuries ago (Stoneybatter) was called Bothar-na-gCloch\\". In Joyce's Irish names of places we find the following interesting information as to the original name of the place: \\"Long before the city had extended so far, and while Stoneybatter was nothing more than a country road, it was -- as it still continues to be -- the great thoroughfare to Dublin from the districts lying west and north-west of the city; and it was known by the name of Bothar-na- gCloch (Bohernaglogh), i.e. the road of the stones, which was changed to the English equivalent, Stoneybatter or stony road\\". Stoneybatter is the main location for events in the Tana French novel \\"The Trespasser\\" and the area is mentioned in the Irish folk song \\"The Spanish Lady\\". In recent years the area has become known as an example of an area undergoing gentrification. Local street names =Viking names= Apart from the striking artisan dwellings, the area is also known for the prominent Viking street names. For example, there is Viking Road, Olaf Road, Thor Place, Sitric Road, Norseman Place, Ard Ri Road, Malachi Road, Ostman Place, Ivar Street, Sigurd Road and Harold Road. At the time of the Norman invasion, the Vikings, Ostmen or Austmenn (men of the East) as they called themselves, were exiled to the north of the Liffey where they founded the hamlet of Ostmenstown later to become Oxmantown. =Other street names= The northern end of Stoneybatter derives its name of Manor Street, bestowed in 1780, from the Manor of Grangegorman in which it was located. During the reign of Charles II (1660-1680), the Manor was held by Sir Thomas Stanley, a knight of Henry Cromwell and a staunch supporter of the Restoration. The short thoroughfare in Stoneybatter called Stanley Street is named after him.Cosgrave, Augustine Dillon, and Carm, O., 'North Dublin City' in Dublin Historical Record, 23(1) (June, 1969), p.7.Ball, Francis Elrington, A History of County Dublin, Volume 6 (Dublin, 1920).

The story is the penultimate arc of Grant Morrison's run as writer on the X-Men, and features the return of Magneto and the death of Jean Grey again. Plot Coming off the heels of the \\"Assault on Weapon Plus\\" storyline, Jean Grey, Beast, and Emma Frost leave the X-Mansion while Xorn forces the newest member of the \\"Special Class\\", Dust, to attack Professor X and destroy Cerebra. Confronting Xavier, Xorn imprisons Dust in a jar to keep her from helping the professor, and then removes his mask, to reveal that he is Magneto in disguise. Magneto, enjoying the lack of progress Xavier has made in improving mutantkind's lot since his \\"death\\" (partly due to his manipulations), has begun to teach his militant anti-human philosophy to the Special Class while indulging in the mutant-power enhancing drug Kick, supplied to him by his helper, Esme of the Stepford Cuckoos. He also reveals that he (Magneto) has been responsible for restoring Xavier's mobility via reprogramming the nanite Sentinels inserted into Xavier's body by Cassandra Nova and shuts them down and places the once more crippled Xavier in a glass tank, in a state of suspended animation. Magneto, surrounded by his followers and original Brotherhood member Toad, takes over New York City. Magneto lays waste to the city and engages in multiple acts of mass murder, killing thousands of humans trapped in the city. Magneto also reveals his grand scheme: reversing Earth's magnetic field and remake the planet as \\"Planet X\\" in which mutants, the possessors of the \\"X-gene\\", ruled over ordinary humans. Meanwhile, in space, Jean Grey and Wolverine are stranded on Asteroid M as Magneto has sent it hurling into the sun just as the two recognize the base. Wanting to end her suffering, Wolverine stabs Jean. Her seeming death allows her to be connect with the Phoenix Force, though in full control over her powers this time, and escape with Logan back to Earth. They rescue Beast and Emma Frost, whose jetcraft was destroyed by Magneto, stranding the two at sea on the wreckage of the ship. Meanwhile, Cyclops and Fantomex organize a resistance group with help from the remaining Stepford Cuckoos, and are joined by Beak, who rejects Magneto when the latter, in part due to his drug addiction and loss of sanity, starts killing humans by the hundreds. In the final showdown, Xavier is freed and the New X-Men unite to fight Magneto. As Magneto murders Esme, Cyclops tells the grieving Emma that he's decided upon which woman (Jean or Emma) he loves but is interrupted by Magneto's attack and responds in kind, destroying his helmet as Fantomex frees Xavier. Desperate for protection against Xavier's telepathy, Magneto grabs his \\"Xorn\\" mask and puts it on. Having realized that Xorn is Magneto or at least believes himself to be Magneto, the X-Men attempt to unbalance him by calling him Xorn as they attack, complete with them begging \\"Xorn\\" to tell them why \\"he\\" betrayed the X-Men. Magneto, whose sanity is slipping due to excessive \\"Kick\\" usage, begins to rant furiously that he is not Xorn, but Magneto as a crowd of Magneto's supporters gather alongside Xavier and Jean Grey. Jean orders Magneto to address his angry army, who are furious at Magneto for the way that he has failed to address the lack of food and water for his makeshift army of Manhattan mutants since taking over the island. Magneto (who removes the \\"Xorn\\" mask) tries to calm them down, but the crowd doesn't recognize him due to his optic blast damaged face. At that point Xavier explains that Magneto, with his murderous rampage, has lost all credibility with the masses. Xavier admits that in death, Magneto had finally gained legitimacy amongst humans and mutants alike as a true figure for change in society but that his return and the mass murders he committed had caused the world to label Magneto as a fraud. Xavier opines that the days of him and Magneto as the sole ideologies of mutantkind was over and that it was time for mutantkind to come up with their own opinions and theories of their place in the world. Magneto falls over and Jean Grey approaches him, only to be hit by a lethal electro-magnetic pulse. As Jean falls to the ground dying, Magneto (putting the Xorn helmet back on) defiantly cries out for someone to kill him; Magneto would rather be dead than judged by the mutant masses as a fraud. Wolverine, now berserk at the sight of Jean dying, uses his claws to decapitate Magneto. Dying, Jean is held tightly by Cyclops as the two reconcile. With her dying breath, Jean begs Cyclops to move on with his life and not waste his remaining days mourning her, as she tells Scott, \\"All I ever do is die on you...\\" The final pages of the issue cut to 150 years into the future, where a \\"Phoenix Egg\\" is found on the moon by an astronaut, offering a segue into the final arc of Morrison's X-Men run, the future based \\"Here Comes Tomorrow\\". Behind the scenes A controversial scene in which Magneto prepares to lead humans into the crematoriums. Art by thumb Grant Morrison had intended Xorn to be the real Magneto. However, Marvel reversed several of Morrison's decisions after the \\"Planet X\\" arc, and reintroduced Magneto (in Chris Claremont's new Excalibur book), establishing that Magneto had survived the destruction of Genosha, and had remained there since. Marvel also introduced a new Xorn (in Chuck Austen's X-Men), establishing that the new Xorn was the brother of the original and that the original had been possessed by some (unknown) force, widely believed to be Sublime, a conscious, highly evolved and intelligent bacteria colony. Austen explained Marvel's reasoning for the retconning, stating that \\"Marvel saw value in Magneto not being a mass-murderer of New Yorkers.\\" Morrison has expressed surprise at the various retcons and explanations for the events of the story that emerged after his departure from Marvel. During an interview, Morrison said \\"Here's how to explain what happened – XORN was NEVER REAL, he was a DISGUISE for MAGNETO who went MAD ON DRUGS and DIED...but we know he always COMES BACK, somehow, so expect a dramatic return sooner or later, True Believers!\\" When asked to comment on his characterization of Magneto, Grant Morrison responded: \\"What people often forget, of course, is that Magneto, unlike the lovely Sir Ian McKellen, is a mad old terrorist twat. No matter how he justifies his stupid, brutal behaviour, or how anyone else tries to justify it, in the end he's just an old bastard with daft, old ideas based on violence and coercion. I really wanted to make that clear at this time.\\" Morrison also stated that the arc was intended as a statement on the rigidly elastic nature of the status quo in franchise comics, and that the arc had taken such dark leanings because \\"my loved ones were dying all around me\\" at the time of writing.

He served as the captain of the New Zealand team in its first seven Test matches. Lowry family Lowry's father, Thomas Henry Lowry, a graduate of Cambridge University, inherited the Lowry property, Okawa, of 20,000 acres,Francis, p. 25. in the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island. He married Helen (\\"Marsie\\") Watt, daughter of James Watt, \\"one of the richest men in New Zealand\\", in 1897.Francis, p. 23. He was a keen cricketer, who played one first-class match for Hawke's Bay and constructed a cricket ground, \\"The Grove\\", on his property, which is still in use.Francis, p. 25. He helped the Hawke's Bay Cricket Association bring out leading English professionals, including Albert Trott and Jack Board, to coach local players.Francis, p. 31. He also developed the Lowry property, which had been largely a sheep and cattle farm, into one of New Zealand's leading racehorse studs. His most prominent success was the mare Desert Gold, who won her first 19 races and finished with 36 wins from 59 starts.Francis, pp. 128–29. Thomas Henry and Marsie had five children between 1898 and 1904:Francis, p. 25. Tom, Jim (who won a tennis Blue at Cambridge University before returning to run part of Okawa),Francis, p. 157. Ralph (Rugby union Blue at Cambridge, another Lowry farmer, and the author of the book Taihape, Be Happy, Die Happy),Francis, p. 157. Gertrude (known as \\"Beet\\") (who married Tom's Cambridge University friend Percy Chapman, who captained the English Test cricket team)Francis, pp. 55–67. and Marion (who married Reg Bettington, Oxford University cricket captain and later medical specialist in New Zealand).Francis, pp. 68–80. Early life Lowry was educated at home until he was 10, when he was enrolled at Heretaunga School for boys in Hastings, where he received cricket coaching from Jack Board.Francis, pp. 31–32. He moved to his father's old school, Christ's College in Christchurch, in 1912.Francis, p. 33. There he captained the cricket first XI in 1915 and 1916 and the Rugby first XV in 1916, as well as winning the school's heavyweight boxing title. His cricket coaches at Christ's College were three New Zealand representatives, James Lawrence, Harold Lusk and Tom Carlton.Francis, p. 34. He also won prizes for Greek, Latin and English.Francis, p. 33. Aiming to join the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, Lowry learned to fly in Auckland in 1917 and 1918. He then went to England, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Air Force in February 1919, three months after the end of the war.Francis, pp. 37–39. Cambridge University and early cricket career While in Auckland, Lowry played club cricket and was selected to play for Auckland against Wellington in January 1918 as a wicket-keeper. Auckland lost, but Lowry scored 28 and 10 (only one Auckland player scored more) and made two catches and a stumping. He stayed in England after being demobilised. His family arrived in England in 1920 in order that the three boys should go to Cambridge and the two girls to finishing school.Francis, p. 40. Before starting his first term at Jesus College, Cambridge, Lowry toured North America with the Incogniti cricket team in August and September 1920, a team that included the 19-year-old Douglas Jardine. Despite his clear cricketing skills, Lowry struggled to establish himself in what was then an excellent first-class side in his first two years at Cambridge, and did not earn his Blue. He did, however, play some games for Somerset, although his qualification to do so was obscure. The story is told that his birthplace was said to be Wellington, without mentioning that it was not the Somerset market town but the city in New Zealand; in fact, this was how Somerset had skirted the regulations for Peter Randall Johnson before World War I.Francis, p. 44. In 1922–23 Lowry was selected to tour with Archie MacLaren's MCC side to Australia and New Zealand. In the three matches against New Zealand he made 54, 61, 13 and 130, his first century in first-class cricket, in 167 minutes. In 1923 he began the season by scoring 161 in 170 minutes for Cambridge University against Lancashire, finally clinching his place in the university side. In his most productive season, playing for Cambridge, Somerset, and the Gentlemen at Lord's, he scored 1564 runs at an average of 35.54. Lowry was captain of Cambridge in 1924, leading them to victory in the annual match against Oxford University at Lord's. Digby Jephson wrote of his captaincy: \\"There was no fuss – no needless shifting of a well- placed field, no hesitation. One could feel in the pavilion the strong magnetic influence of one man over ten.\\"Digby Jephson writing in The Cricketer, quoted in Francis, p. 54. He again toured North America with the Incogniti after the English season. Although Lowry achieved his BA degree in history, he was more interested in the extracurricular activities that Cambridge University life offered than in study. He used to employ a cramming tutor in third term to make up for the work he had not done in first and second terms.Francis, pp. 41–42. Return to New Zealand The family returned to New Zealand late in 1924, all three brothers having got their Cambridge degrees. Tom bought two farms, of 2700 acres and 6000 acres, not far from Okawa, which he farmed until 1944, when his father died and Tom inherited Okawa.Francis, p. 81. Playing in a local cricket match for Moawhango against Taihape in December 1924 Lowry took 9 for 6, including four wickets in successive balls. Although he had played no first-class cricket in the 1924–25 season, Lowry was selected in the New Zealand team that toured Australia in 1925–26. He played in all four first-class matches, and scored 123 against South Australia in only 90 minutes.Francis, p. 81. The New Zealand Cricket Council decided to send a team for a full-season tour of England in 1927. Lowry at last made his Plunket Shield debut in 1926–27, playing for Wellington, and finished at the top of the Shield averages with 257 runs at 64.25. Although he was not captain of Wellington, he was selected to captain the New Zealand side on its most important tour so far. Tour of England, 1927 The first first-class match was against the MCC at Lord's. In a high- scoring draw, Lowry scored 106 and 63 not out. The first victory came in the sixth match, when Lowry scored 105 \\"at a run-a-minute\\" and the New Zealanders easily beat Sussex.Francis, p. 87. Six players, including Lowry, scored over 1000 runs on the tour. Lowry came third in both aggregates and averages, with 1277 runs at 38.69.Francis, p. 92. While the team's batting performed well, the bowling, apart from the leg-spinners Bill Merritt and Roger Blunt, was often ineffective. Lowry used frequent bowling changes in order to unsettle the batsmen. Although he was the team's reserve wicket-keeper, he often brought himself on for a few overs of his medium pace. His specialty was a surprise full toss at the batsman's chest.Francis, p. 91. He took 15 wickets on the tour as well as making 20 catches and five stumpings. The team played 26 first-class matches, winning seven, losing five and drawing 14.Francis, p. 94. Test captain In 1927–28 Lowry scored 317 runs at 63.40 in the Plunket Shield, coming second in the national aggregates and averages and helping Wellington to the championship. In the last match of the competition he made 181, his highest score, in a 276-run victory over Auckland. He captained New Zealand in the two representative matches against the touring Australian team in 1927–28. He took over the captaincy of Wellington in 1928–29, scoring 251 runs at 50.20, and leading the team to second place. In the lead-up to New Zealand's first Test series against England in 1929–30 he led Wellington to victory in the Plunket Shield, scoring 255 runs at 42.50. In the First Test Lowry was out for a second-ball duck in the first innings, but top-scored in the second with 40, the last batsman out as New Zealand tried unsuccessfully to set England a challenging target. The other three Tests were drawn. Lowry again top-scored in the Fourth Test, scoring 80 and adding 100 for the seventh wicket with Herb McGirr to take the side to safety. Lowry scored 272 runs at 47.33 in the 1930–31 Plunket Shield, but Wellington finished third. Tour of England, 1931 Lowry was appointed to captain the New Zealand team to tour England in 1931. At a time of financial difficulty for New Zealand cricket he was also asked to manage the side, and was given only 14 players for the four- month tour.Francis, p. 101. Early in the tour the New Zealanders beat a strong MCC side by an innings. New Zealand batted first, Lowry scoring a brisk century. Rain allowed only 106 overs on the first two days, and Lowry declared before the third and final day began. Ian Cromb then took 6 for 46 with his pace bowling to dismiss MCC for 132, but when Lowry enforced the follow-on with only 170 minutes of play left, he gave the ball instead to the leg- spinner Bill Merritt, who proceeded to take 7 for 28 in nine overs and dismiss MCC for 48.R.T. Brittenden, Great Days in New Zealand Cricket, A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1958, pp. 74–79. The only scheduled Test resulted in a high- scoring and close-fought draw after Lowry declared New Zealand's second innings. In response to public demand the English cricket authorities added two more Tests.Francis, p. 106. In the Second Test, however, the New Zealanders were overwhelmed by an innings. Lowry top-scored in the first innings with a defiant 62 on a difficult wicket, an innings which the New Zealand journalist Budge Hintz described as \\"an exhibition of pluck and determination as inspiring as the game can provide\\".Quoted in Francis, p. 107. The Third Test was washed out after only three hours' play.Francis, p. 107. It was Lowry's last Test. In the tour overall Lowry scored 1290 runs at 31.46, coming fourth in both aggregates and averages, made 29 catches and six stumpings, as well as taking 15 wickets at 18.26 with what Wisden called \\"his weird bowling theories\\".Quoted in Francis, p. 103. After the tour, Pelham Warner said Lowry was \\"the best skipper to tour England since the Australian Monty Noble in 1909\\".Quoted in Francis, p. 112. R.C. Robertson-Glasgow said Lowry was \\"a remarkable cricketer, strong, versatile, courageous, original, and a leader in a thousand\\".Quoted in Francis, p. 5. After Test cricket Lowry announced his retirement from international cricket after the tour. He led Wellington to another Plunket Shield victory in 1931–32 but made only 53 runs himself in three matches. He captained Wellington twice more in 1932–33, then retired. In 1933 Lowry married a neighbour, Margot Russell, one of three daughters of General Sir Andrew Hamilton Russell, the commander of the New Zealand Division in World War I. They had two girls and two boys: Ann (born in 1934), Tom (1936), Pat (1938) and Carol (1943).Francis, pp. 114–17. Lowry continued to play club cricket. In a minor match in Taihape in December 1933 his team needed 69 runs to win in 18 minutes, and they won by 10 wickets, Lowry scoring 67 not out. In 1935–36 he captained a team from Rangitikei in a Hawke Cup match, top-scoring in both innings.Manawatu v Rangitikei 1935–36. cricketarchive.co.uk He was asked to manage the 1937 team to tour England, doubling as reserve wicket-keeper.Francis, p. 118. Margot travelled with him. While on tour they were invited to attend the coronation of George VI in Westminster Abbey.Francis, p. 119. In 12 matches Lowry scored 409 runs at 27.26 and made eight catches and 12 stumpings.New Zealanders batting and fielding 1937. cricketarchive.co.uk He scored his last first-class century, 121, with 18 fours and a six, against Nottinghamshire.Francis, p. 122. Lowry later served as President of the New Zealand Cricket Council between 1950 and 1953.Francis, p. 148. Jack Phillipps, a New Zealand cricket administrator from the 1920s to the 1960s, said Lowry was New Zealand's best captain in that period: \\"If you put 11 players through a gate on to a cricket field and Tom Lowry was one of them, I think most people would say, 'Well, there's the skipper.' He had that sort of air of command about him.\\"Quoted in Francis, p. 155. In 1996, Lowry was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.Tom Lowry. New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame Horse breeding and racing Having been too young to fight in World War I, Lowry tried to enlist in the army at the outbreak of World War II but at 41 he was rejected on physical grounds.Francis, p. 141. In 1942 he inherited the 80,000-acre Darr River Downs station near Longreach in Queensland. When Lowry took over Okawa in 1944 he carried on the racehorse stud that his father had developed. He imported the stallion Faux Tirage from England at a cost of 25,000 pounds. Among Faux Tirage's progeny was Straight Draw, which won the 1957 Melbourne Cup.Francis, p. 130. Lowry liked single-syllable names for his horses: three of his most successful horses were Key, Mop and Game.Ten Champion New Zealand Breeders Retrieved 22 February 2014. Game won 26 races, and Key won 19 as a three-year- old. Other prominent Lowry horses included Froth, Rover, Humber, Knave and Hot Drop.Francis, pp. 130–32. Lowry helped to form the New Zealand Thoroughbred Breeders Association in 1948 and served as its president from 1951 to 1965.NZTBA website Retrieved 22 February 2014. Since Tom Lowry's death Okawa has been run by his son Tom, and grandson, also Tom. Since its founding the property has been run by five generations of Tom Lowrys.Francis, p. 158.

Born in New York, he became a lawyer and politician in North Carolina in the 1760s. He first came to fame as the focus of hatred of the Regulators, and led anti-Regulator militia in the War of the Regulation. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, he was driven from his home in New York, and joined the British Army, recruiting other Loyalists. He served during campaigns in New England and the South. At the end of the war in 1783 he became a United Empire Loyalist, settling in Nova Scotia. St Mary Abbots Church Fanning was appointed lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia not long after his arrival, and helped oversee the resettlement of other Loyalist refugees in the province. In 1786 he was appointed lieutenant governor of Saint John's Island, which was renamed Prince Edward Island during his tenure. He served in that post until 1813. He retired to London, where he died in 1818. Life Edmund Fanning was born in the Town of Southold on Long Island in the colony of New York to Captain James Fanning and Hannah Smith. Nova Scotia Governor John Parr believed Fanning was, like Parr, a Protestant Irishman, and was from Ulster and owned great estates there.Memoir of Governor John Parr, page 56 He graduated from Yale College in 1757. He then moved to the Province of North Carolina in 1761 where he read law with Attorney-General Robert Jones and settled in Hillsborough. Sibley's Harvard Graduates, Volume XIV, pages 160 and 161. He held several local political posts and became a protégé of colonial governor William Tryon. Fanning came into conflict with the leaders of the Regulator movement. He, along with lawyer Francis Nash, was charged with extorting money from the local residents, but was fined only a small fine. After several riots, the movement was crushed by the army of North Carolina militia led by Tryon at the Battle of Alamance on May 16, 1771. Fanning followed Tryon to New York as his personal secretary. At the start of the American Revolutionary War, revolutionaries drove Fanning from his home, forcing him to seek refuge aboard in the New York harbor. After being commissioned a colonel by General William Howe, Fanning raised a regiment of Loyalists named the King's American Regiment on Staten Island, New York. He was wounded twice during the war and was credited with saving Yale from destruction by British forces during a destructive raid against New Haven led by Tryon. Fanning was granted an honorary law degree in 1803 as thanks for this action. He was later appointed to the office of surveyor general, which he retained until he fled, with other Loyalists, to Nova Scotia in 1783. Fanning became lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia in that same year, serving as deputy to Governor John Parr. On November 30, 1785 he married Phebe Maria Burns. In 1786, he was appointed lieutenant governor of St. John's Island (which was later renamed Prince Edward Island) by the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, a post which he held for almost 19 years, resigning in 1805. Prince Edward Island's Government House, the official residence of the lieutenant governor, is often referred to as \\"Fanningbank\\" on the island, though Fanning never dwelt there. He was promoted to general of the British Army in 1808. He retired to London in 1813 and died there in 1818. Despite having several children, Fanning had no grandchildren. He had two daughters, Lady Wood, who lived near London with her mother; the other daughter married a Captain Bentwick Cumberland, a nephew of Lord Bentwick, and lived in Charlotte's Town, Prince Edward Island. He also had several prominent nephews, including the like-named explorer Edmund Fanning, the war hero Nathaniel Fanning, and the celebrated attorney John Wickham. A great nephew was James Fannin.

The name, a portmanteau of \\"sporty\\" and \\"coupe,\\" was pronounced \\"scoop\\". In the UK and other countries it is known as an \\"S Coupé\\". It was sold in the US from December 1988 through 1995. An 81 horsepower, 1.5L Mitsubishi sourced I4 engine provided power to the front wheels via a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Several changes came for 1993, when Scoupes got a facelift, including the current Hyundai \\"H\\" logo, new flush headlamps plus body-colored side moldings and redesigned front sheetmetal, taillights, and rear bumper. The Base and LS models came with a new and improved, In-house manufactured, 1.5L 12-valve, direct-port fuel- injected engine, called \\"Alpha\\". The 1,495 cc Alpha, with a bore and an stroke, produced at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm in naturally aspirated form, with a 10:1 compression ratio, and at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm when turbocharged, with a 7.5:1 compression ratio. Turbos came only with 5-speed manual shift, while Base and LS models could have an optional 4-speed automatic. The Australian spec S-Coupe GT Turbo has been road tested by several Australian magazines, returning times of 9.2-9.3 secs for 0–100 km/h and 16.8 secs for the 0–400 m dash. Facelifted rear of Hyundai Scoupe Hyundai says the Scoupe was the first production application for Garrett Automotive Products' T15 turbocharger, which was new for the early 1990s. The turbo unit includes water-cooled bearings and housings and an integral wastegate. The naturally aspirated Alpha boasts a 14% increase in power over its 1.5L Mitsubishi-designed predecessor, and the turbo produces 42% more power. The GT's EPA was city, and highway. The 1988-92 \\"Base\\" models achieved city and Hwy for Manual Trans, and city and for Automatic. For 1993 the Scoupe received a facelift and Hyundai's first internally developed engine. The 1993-95 \\"Base\\" Alpha 1.5 engine models achieved city Hwy for Manual Trans and City and for Automatic. The car was replaced by the Tiburon in 1996. This car made an appearance on BBC Top Gear Series 13 Episode 2 as Richard Hammond's car for the challenge where the presenters are finding the perfect car for a 17-year-old driver. Scoupe Turbo The Scoupe GT (LS Turbo in the USA 115 HP) was Hyundai's first attempt at a sports car and featured South Korea's first domestically designed engine with a cast-iron block and crankshaft. The engine contains an aluminum head, aluminum pistons and titanium connecting rods. A special compact heatproof ceramic combustion chamber design with central spark plug location was incorporated to optimize engine efficiency. The engine utilizes a Robert Bosch GmbH electronic engine control system and a knock sensor.

Garter encircled arms of Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland, KG, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel. Charles Cecil John Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland KG (16 May 1815 – 3 March 1888, in Belvoir Castle), styled Marquess of Granby before 1857, was an English Conservative politician. Background and education Manners was the third but eldest surviving son of John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland and Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle. John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland and Lord George Manners were his younger brothers. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, earning an MA in 1835. Political career Entering politics as Member of Parliament for Stamford in 1837, Manners became known as a voluble, if not particularly talented, protectionist. He briefly held office as a Lord of the Bedchamber to Prince Albert from 1843 to 1846. Following the resignation of Lord George Bentinck from the leadership of the protectionists in the House of Commons at the beginning of 1848, Granby (as he was then known) became leader on 10 February 1848, as Benjamin Disraeli was unacceptable to Lord Derby, the overall leader of the party, and the majority of the rank and file. Granby resigned on 4 March 1848, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without an actual leader in the Commons for the remainder of the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by the triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and J. C. Herries. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851. He also declined to join the First Derby Ministry in 1852, and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire instead. Granby succeeded to the dukedom of Rutland on the death of his father in 1857. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1867. He also succeeded his father as Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire, which post he held until his death on 4 March 1888, at the age of 72. Personal life Rutland never married. He had cherished a passion for Mary Anne Ricketts, later Lady Forester, but his father forbade the two to marry. He was also devoted to Lady Miles, wife of Sir Philip Miles, and scandalised society by leaving her his 120 ft yacht, Lufra, in his will. He was succeeded in the dukedom by his brother John.

Hush first appeared in Batman #609 (January 2003) as part of the 12-issue storyline Batman: Hush. He was created by Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee. A former friend of Batman, the character serves as a criminal foil personality to him. The character has been portrayed in live-action as a kid by Cole Vallis and Gordon Winarick in Gotham, and by Gabriel Mann in the television series Batwoman which marks the first live-action appearance of the Hush persona. Warren Christie portrays the character disguised as Bruce Wayne. Publication history Hush resurfaced in Batman: Gotham Knights, and later in Detective Comics and Batman: Streets of Gotham. He was also the architect behind several of the events of Batman Eternal. Fictional character biography =Origin= Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Elliot was a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne, and was also born into a wealthy family. The two boys often played a Stratego- esque minifigure game together, and Tommy taught Bruce to think like his opponents and to use their abilities against them in order to win, which proved useful years later when he became Batman. Thus, as a child, Tommy exhibits a genius level intellect due to his capability to think and plan strategically. Tommy despised both his abusive father and his frail, submissive mother, who came from poverty and willingly endured every abuse dealt to her and her son to keep her lavish lifestyle. For all their failings, however, Tommy's parents made sure he was well-educated, in particular teaching him about the philosophy of Aristotle, which he often quotes. Driven by his desire for independence and wealth, Tommy severed the brake line of his parents' car, causing a crash that killed his father and injured his mother; his mother, however, was saved in an emergency operation by Dr. Thomas Wayne, which enraged young Elliot. While at a summer camp with Bruce, Tommy attacked a boy and ended up in a psychiatric ward; he blamed Bruce and his mother for his outburst. He is released by an intern named Jonathan Crane, who becomes the villain Scarecrow. During the next few years, Tommy tended to his mother. When Bruce's parents were murdered, Tommy resented him for inheriting the Wayne family fortune, just as he had hoped to do with his parents' money. Shortly before Bruce returned to Gotham City, Tommy befriended a young woman named Peyton Riley (who would later become the second Ventriloquist) – a relationship of which his mother never approved. When Tommy's mother recovered from cancer, she disowned him, subsequently cutting him off from the Elliot family fortune in retaliation for his continuing relationship with Peyton. As a result, Tommy murdered her by smothering her with a pillow, while Peyton killed their lawyer and destroyed Mrs. Elliot's new will. As far as the rest of the world was concerned, his mother had died of a household accident. Finally the sole recipient of his family's fortune, Tommy abandoned Peyton and began traveling the world, as Bruce had. Although he went on to Harvard University and became a successful surgeon, Tommy continued to harbor an irrational grudge towards his childhood friend. At some point in his career, Edward Nygma, also known as the Riddler, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and eventually hijacked one of Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pits to regain his health. During this mystical treatment, which renders the participant temporarily insane, the Riddler experienced an unexpected epiphany: he realized that Bruce Wayne was Batman. Soon afterwards, the Riddler attempted to sell Tommy the secrets of his newfound revelation in exchange for a large cash sum. Tommy, by this time having discovered Nygma's criminal background, instead offered to pay him to kill Bruce. Realizing that they shared a common hatred for Wayne, Tommy and the Riddler decided to pool resources to bring him down. To this end, Elliot created for himself the persona of \\"Hush\\". Riddler said that the name started out as a joking reference to the need to keep Tommy's identity secret, but became a more permanent alias when Scarecrow started to sing the lullaby \\"Hush, Little Baby\\". =Hush character arc= In their attempt to destroy Batman, Hush and the Riddler manipulated several other villains into unwillingly helping them. These included the Joker, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Killer Croc and Clayface. They even manipulated some of Batman's closest allies (Superman, Huntress, and Catwoman) against the Dark Knight, utilizing such methods as Poison Ivy using her pheromones to control the Man of Steel and Catwoman and Hush's seemingly benevolent funding of Huntress's vigilante activities. Part of their plot included fooling Bruce into believing the Joker had murdered Tommy; Clayface shapeshifted into Tommy's corpse in order to create this illusion. Cover to Batman: Hush Vol. 2 (December 2003). Pencils by Jim Lee. With these villains as their pawns, Hush and the Riddler set up an elaborate plot against Batman. Jason Todd, who was believed to be dead for years, entered the pact with the villains and gave them insights on how Batman thought. Using the shapeshifting abilities of Clayface, they created a decoy of the former Robin; Hush collaborated with Riddler, Todd, and Clayface to use the Dark Knight's guilt over his ward's apparent death against him at Todd's gravesite.Batman #617–618 (September–October 2003). DC Comics.Batman Annual (vol. 1) #25 (March 2006). DC Comics.Red Hood: The Lost Days #6 (January 2011). DC Comics. Around this time, Hush cured the disfigured Harold Allnut, a longtime associate of Batman. In return, Harold 'bugged' the Batcave with several devices that altered Batman's mind, but nevertheless remained loyal to the Caped Crusader; he was certain that Batman would triumph over whatever followed. Hush then killed Harold in front of Batman, and immediately engaged the Dark Knight in battle. Batman was at first disoriented by Hush's quoting of Aristotle, prompting him to briefly wonder if Hush is Maxie Zeus. He noticed that Hush used Deadshot's two-gun fighting style, and theorized that he was either the assassin himself or one of his protégés. When Tommy finally revealed himself to a worn-out Batman, the Dark Knight was saved only by the intervention of Harvey Dent, whose Two-Face persona had been unwittingly wiped out by Tommy when he repaired Dent's disfigured face. Once again on the side of the law, Dent shot Hush twice, throwing him off a bridge. Although Batman was sure that Hush was his childhood friend Thomas Elliot, he was not able to unmask him.Batman #619 (November 2003). DC Comics. =Hush Returns= Still out to destroy Batman and determined not to let the rest of the villains get in his way, Hush quickly carved out a niche for himself, beating his former accomplice the Riddler to within an inch of his life. Hush even drives the Joker out of the city, thus proving to the Clown Prince that Hush can be a threat to him. He also temporarily killed Poison Ivy during a failed attempt to recruit her. Hush Returns. Cover to Batman: Gotham Knights #60 (December 2004). Pencils by Jae Lee. Following a short-lived alliance with JLA nemesis Prometheus, Hush began to torment Bruce Wayne with help from Clayface. Exploiting the latter's shapeshifting abilities, Hush was briefly able to shed doubt on his true identity and had Alfred Pennyworth framed for murder, using samples taken from the new Clayface to infect Alfred with a virus that would allow Elliot to control him. Hush also attempted to analyse samples taken from Clayface with the goal of duplicating Clayface's shape-shifting abilities for himself without the usual side-effects such as loss of a default human form, eventually attempting to perfect this analysis by releasing Cassius Payne from prison, reasoning that samples from Cassius would be more useful as he is the only 'pure' Clayface... the only one who was never human in the first place. After Clayface realised that he was being manipulated, he provided Batman with a sample of himself to find a cure for Alfred's condition despite knowing that this would not leave Batman with time to cure him, and also ensured that Alfred's name would be cleared by ensuring that his final appearance after death would be a form whose fingerprints so closely resembled Alfred's that the detectives would assume that they had made a mistake (The aforementioned events occur in issue #50–55 and #61–72). =Payback= The Joker eventually returned to Gotham City with an army of trained pigeons and retaliated (in Batman: Gotham Knights #73–74). He captured Hush and kept him sedated for three weeks, during which time he implanted a pacemaker into his body, effectively gaining control of his heart. At the Joker's mercy and unable to remove the device himself, Hush turned to the one man he felt he could trust (or rather, predict): Bruce Wayne. Bruce consented to help Hush on the condition that he allow himself to be treated in, and confined to, Arkham Asylum. Hush agreed, and then immediately escaped after being told that the surgery had been a success. He was intercepted by Batman before he could confront the Joker and demanded that Batman allow him to kill the Joker. Batman seemed to agree and began to leave, but then revealed that he had tricked Hush – the pacemaker was still in his body, and he had been allowed to escape from Arkham. At that moment, the Joker arrived, and Hush begged Batman not to leave him. The issue (and the Batman: Gotham Knights series) ended unresolved. Hush returned in the later Man-Bat miniseries,Man-Bat #1–5 (June–October 2006). DC Comics. and is later shown remembering how painful it was to remove the pacemaker alone, and how the time between Gotham Knights and Heart of Hush was mostly spent recovering from the damage suffered, confirming that Batman did desert Hush at the conclusion of \\"Payback\\". =\\"Heart of Hush\\"= Hush returned in Detective Comics #846-#850, in the story \\"Heart of Hush\\", which tied together with \\"Batman R.I.P.\\". In this arc, set a few nights before the events depicted in \\"R.I.P.\\", Hush was portrayed in a slightly different thematic fashion than in his prior appearances. His past as a surgeon was made into a major aspect of his modus operandi. In the first issue, Hush revealed that his return was hastened when he began to hear whispers of the Black Glove's upcoming attack on Batman. Believing that it was his right and his right alone to kill Batman, Hush sought to beat the Black Glove to the punch. In the second part, Hush teamed up with the Scarecrow. He performed routine plastic surgery on his own face, only later revealing the result was nigh identical to Bruce Wayne.Detective Comics #849 (December 2008). DC Comics. Hush then ambushed and subdued Catwoman after she scratched off a portion of his facial bandages, recoiling in horror at what she saw. He then cut out her heart, putting her on life support supplied by Mr. Freeze, and delivered her to Gotham General Hospital. To himself, Hush thought about how he had begun formulating his plan after Batman had abandoned him. While Catwoman was left in Doctor Mid-Nite's care, Batman squeezed the location of Hush's headquarters from Scarecrow. Hush ambushed Batman by showing him the room containing Catwoman's heart, alive and pumping, at which time he pumped Batman with a paralyzing gas. He then confessed to Batman his plan: using his newfound resemblance to Bruce, he would kill and disfigure him to steal his identity, eliminating those who knew him best and would regularly interact with Bruce, and then he would retire with the Wayne fortune, reasoning that the other heroes would accept that Batman had earned the right to end his career. However, Batman was able to stave off the effects of the paralysis gas, recover Catwoman's heart, and warn Alfred of Hush's deception. Although Alfred disarmed Elliot, Hush managed to get into the Batcave where he nearly killed Batman, but Alfred's continuing interference and the arrival of Nightwing and Robin turned the tide. Hush retreated on the Whirly-Bat (a one- man helicopter), but his bandages became tangled in the rotor and it exploded. Batman, Nightwing, and Robin could find no trace of Hush, save some bloody bandages, and concluded that he was dead. Catwoman, not taking chances and seeking some form of closure for her predicament and current condition (Doctor Mid-Nite made it clear that it was unlikely that she would ever regain her physical prowess), had Oracle, Holly Robinson, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn and Slam Bradley track down Hush's secret bank accounts and stashes of cash and cut them off. Hush, wounded but alive, limped off to plot his next move. Later, posing as Bruce Wayne, Hush traveled to Australia and Vietnam looting the cash accounts of Wayne Enterprises' subsidiaries. He was captured by Catwoman, who knew perfectly well he was not the real Bruce Wayne. She brought him to Nightwing and Robin, who kept him contained in a secret safe house. Hush, still wearing Bruce's appearance, decided to fake his surrender, waiting for the right moment to escape. =Batman reborn= In Streets of Gotham, Batman's biological son Damian Wayne visited Hush in his cell as the new Robin, and they played chess. When Damian left to deal with a new crisis, Hush surmised that Firefly was behind the attack. He noted how Gotham City had fallen apart in Batman's absence, and pondered how to use the current situation to his advantage.Batman: Streets of Gotham #1 (August 2009). DC Comics. Hush faked experiencing spontaneous combustion, and when Alfred arrived at his cell to assist, Hush overpowered him and escaped. He then re- emerged as Bruce Wayne, claiming that he would donate a billion dollars a month to Gotham City until the financial crisis was over. Dick and Damian, along with the Outsiders and assorted other superheroes, explained to Hush that they would always watch and control him- with the other heroes acting as a 'board of directors' intended to 'supervise' his financial dealings- and that someone will always be ready to take him down if he steps out of line. With no other option available to him, Hush reluctantly agreed to play Dick Grayson's puppet, posing as Bruce Wayne, and thus keeping the public from realizing that Bruce was dead.Batman: Streets of Gotham #4 (November 2009). DC Comics. Though this ruined his original plan to sap the Wayne fortune, Hush did not allow it to halt his scheming altogether. Hush had appeared, notably as a member of the Gotham Shield Committee, around Gotham quite frequently, often attempting to make connections. When Ra's al Ghul arrived in Gotham, promising to ruin the Wayne family in retaliation against Red Robin, he immediately sought out Hush.Batgirl vol. 3 #8 (March 2010). DC Comics. Faced with the prospect of Hush using Ra's al Ghul's support to turn on the Bat- family again, Tim Drake activated a contingency plan set in place by Wayne himself to transfer controlling interest in Wayne Enterprises to Drake \\"if something should happen\\". This left Hush with no official standing in the company.Red Robin #12 (May 2010). DC Comics. =\\"House of Hush\\"= Hush reappeared in Streets of Gotham for the story arc \\"House of Hush\\" beginning in #14.Batman: Streets of Gotham #14 (July 2010). DC Comics. He attempted to push the boundaries of his new role as Bruce Wayne, such as recommending that convicted criminals be allowed back on the streets. However, this plan backfired when the criminal Jane Doe—a woman who lost her face in an accident and had resorted to cutting off the faces of others—became obsessed with 'Bruce Wayne' after he had her released. She infiltrated his life by taking the face of his new assistant, and subsequently cut off Elliot's new face with the intention of becoming Bruce Wayne herself. Batman caught her and Hush, and they were both sent to Arkham. During the events of Batman: Gates of Gotham, Hush was freed from Arkham by a new villain named the Architect. As this happened, Red Robin, Nightwing, and Blackbat realized that the Elliot family was connected to a series of bombings that destroyed three historical Gotham bridges. Nightwing found Hush, who had been betrayed by the Architect and strapped to a bomb, but was forced to sacrifice Wayne Tower to save his life.Batman: Gates of Gotham #1 (July 2011). DC Comics. =The New 52: \\"Batman Eternal\\"= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Hush first appears in issue twenty-one of Batman Eternal as the apparent mastermind behind Commissioner Gordon's downfall and Carmine Falcone's return. After injecting Alfred with fear toxin, Hush was seen communicating with Jason Bard about taking control of Gotham.Batman Eternal #21 (August 2014). DC Comics. In issue twenty-six, a slightly revised origin for Hush was revealed; he was still Tommy Elliott, a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne, but in this version, his parricide is explicitly described as a way for him to get closer to Bruce (who had started distancing himself from Tommy after the death of his own parents) rather than as a way for him to receive his inheritance.Batman Eternal #26 (October 2014). DC Comics. Hush turned public opinion against Wayne Enterprises by blowing up one of Batman's hidden weapon caches (known to be connected to Wayne Enterprises after the events of Batman Incorporated) below Gotham, killing an unknown number of civilians, policemen and military personnel. He was able to enter the cache with DNA taken from Alfred Pennyworth.Batman Eternal #32 (November 2014). DC Comics. After having blown up another weapon cache and having been shot through the shoulder with a grappling hook by Julia Pennyworth, Hush gave up his location to Batman to face him in a final showdown. They met and fought in a weapon cache below the Martha Wayne Foundation hospital, which Hush had rigged to explode as a backup plan. Batman defeated Hush, but was then informed that the government had seized control of Wayne Enterprises and its holdings due to its involvement in the catastrophic explosions around Gotham. Hush then taunted Batman, stating, \\"Maybe you're right Bruce, maybe I'm not you. But right now, who would want to be?\\"Batman Eternal #34 (November 2014). DC Comics. Hush was then kept as prisoner in the Batcave, but broke out with the help of the then unknown mastermind behind the current threat. Hush proceeded to sabotage the equipment of several members of the Batman Family via the Batcomputer as they fought various villains, including crashing the Batwing with Batman still in it. He was then returned to captivity after having been ambushed by Alfred Pennyworth, Alfred harshly informing Hush that he was hardly going to be locked up in his own home.Batman Eternal #47. DC Comics. =DC Rebirth= After DC Comics' new line-wide relaunch Rebirth, Hush first appeared in a single-panel cameo in issue 19 of Batman (vol. 3), wherein he is an inmate at Arkham Asylum and beaten up by Bane.Batman #19 (March 2017). DC Comics. Then, in the one-shot Batman: Prelude To The Wedding: Nightwing vs. Hush #1, Hush is \\"tipped off\\" to Batman's upcoming wedding by the Joker. Hush attempts to attack Batman's bachelor party, causing a disaster to distract Superman and then attacking Batman and Nightwing. In the course of the confrontation, Hush's attack disrupts a dimensional gate Superman had provided that was intended to take Batman to a peaceful pocket universe, resulting in Hush and Nightwing being trapped in an in-between place for individuals who have lost all sense of individual identity. As Hush's rants affirm his inability to forge a life for himself outside of an obsession with Bruce Wayne, he reveals that he has given himself plastic surgery to look like Dick Grayson to try and recapture his old friendship with Bruce. Nightwing, despite feeling some sympathy for Hush, nevertheless leaves him behind in the pocket dimension while he escapes back home.Batman: Prelude To The Wedding: Nightwing vs. Hush #1 (June 2018). DC Comics. However, in Batman #70, Hush is apparently back in Arkham Asylum as he is one of several villains Batman beats up during his escape after having been captured and subjected to mental torture by Scarecrow, The Flashpoint Batman and Bane.Batman #70 (June 2019). DC Comics. Later, Hush is shown to be a member of Bane's police force after he had taken control over the institutions of Gotham. Hush duels with Batman, but loses.Batman #80 (October 2019).

Before even his teenage years, he was already operating on a high level of sociopathy, going so far as severing the brake line of his parents' car to gain independence from them and inherit the Elliot family fortune. When Bruce Wayne's parents died and he inherited the Wayne family fortune, as well as independence, from them - the very two things Tommy sought to gain from his parents' death - Tommy developed an irrational hatred for his childhood friend, spawned from the fact Bruce's father Thomas Wayne was the one who operated on and saved his mother, foiling the young Elliot's plan of parricide, and that via the death of his parents', Bruce had gained everything he wanted. This deep-rooted hatred would then carry on into Tommy's adulthood, resulting in him adopting his Hush persona. Elliot also seems to be obsessed with mystery and subterfuge, preferring to operate from the shadows and having cast doubts over his own identity and motivations several times. =Skills and abilities= Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Elliot has spent most of his life honing his skills enough to be a match for the Dark Knight. One of the finest surgeons in Gotham City, Thomas Elliot has an incredible, genius-level intellect and is also a master planner, with tactical skills rivaling those of the Caped Crusader. Hush's greatest asset is his talent for thinking like his opponents and for using their abilities against them. Ironically, Bruce Wayne learned his strategic skills from Elliot in childhood before their respective parents' deaths. Hush is an expert marksman, able to shoot two batarangs out of the air and set off C4 explosive using twin M1911 .45 caliber pistols, his weapons of choice. While not possessing the kind of martial arts training that Bruce Wayne acquired, Hush has proven his ability to fight hand-to-hand; he shows expertise and competence, being able to fight almost on par with Batman. He has performed breakthrough medical operations, such as removing Harold Allnut's hunchback and giving him the ability to speak, repairing Harvey Dent's face, inventing a virus which accelerates Killer Croc's devolution, and tearing out Catwoman's heart without doing any lasting damage. Hush is also able to perform plastic surgery on himself, using minimal anesthetic and sheer force of will. He's implied to have removed the pacemaker installed on his own heart by himself, and has shown the ability to grant himself the appearance of someone else, such as Bruce Wayne, using only a long series of planned surgeries on his own face, with the aid of a simple mirror. Thomas Elliot previously had access to the vast resources of his family fortune, putting him on par with Bruce Wayne in wealth, and so he is able to fund his more expensive plans. He is also able to buy the cooperation of the main villains in Gotham, like Mr. Freeze. However, since the \\"Heart of Hush\\" storyline, Catwoman has tapped his resources, reducing him to poverty. He then put in motion a plan to use his newfound resemblance to Bruce Wayne to leech off the Wayne fortune, cutting off the Batman Family from it as well. This plan was thwarted when he underestimated his foes, finding himself merely a puppet of the Batman Family and their allies as he serves to create the impression that Bruce Wayne is still alive. Other versions =Batman Beyond= The 2010 Batman Beyond miniseries revealed that Bruce Wayne's last fight with Hush occurred on a rainy night and consisted primarily of a rooftop chase. As a last-minute means of escape, Elliot dove into an open window, only to be shot by the homeowner who mistook him for an invader. With Batman severely injured and not on good terms with the police, he left Hush's body without examining it himself. Bruce seemed initially satisfied with the official police identification of the body as Elliot's. However, he later admits suspecting that Hush's skill for strategy and plastic surgery could have fabricated the entire scenario. Some time after the events of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Terry McGinnis discovers the former Signalman murdered in a manner reminiscent of Two-Face's M.O. He subsequently tracks the murderer to a hospital where an aged Jervis Tetch is being held and finds a bandaged man standing over a badly injured nurse. The man flees as Terry rushes over to the nurse, who says the man uttered a single word, \\"Hush\\".Batman Beyond #1 (June 2010). DC Comics. Returning to the cave, Terry learns what happened in Bruce's last fight with Hush. Terry soon discovers that the reformed villain, Armory, has been killed with sharpened umbrellas (the Penguin's weapon of choice). Attempting to stay ahead of their foe, Terry and Bruce search out the Calendar Man (Julian Gregory Day). Upon confronting Day, Terry is suddenly ambushed by Hush, who broke in beforehand.Batman Beyond #2 (July 2010). DC Comics. During Terry's fight with the new Hush, it is revealed that this Hush is not only capable of matching the current Batman in a fight, but is also aware of Bruce Wayne's identity as Batman. He regards Terry as an impostor with no understanding of what it means to be Batman. He also regards his murders of Batman's rogues gallery as orphaning Batman all over again by killing his enemies as the only loving family he has had. Hush escapes by throwing the Calendar Man out the window with a bomb attached to Day's chest. Terry chooses to try and save Day, but fails. Confirming that Tim Drake was under constant physical and psychological observation since his time as the Joker, Terry eliminates Drake as a suspect and proceeds to confront Dick Grayson. Meanwhile, Hush is revealed to have hired the new Catwoman to plant a tracking device on Batman, before proceeding to strangle her as part of his vendetta. A brief scene with Amanda Waller and a woman identified as Doctor Reid suggests a connection between Project Cadmus and Hush. However, Waller insists that they keep their knowledge of this Hush quiet.Batman Beyond #3 (August 2010). DC Comics. Using the new Bat-Wraith (a robot designed to replace Terry as Batman), Bruce intervenes in Hush's attempt to kill Catwoman. Hush demonstrates a knowledge of Bruce's old methods—including his equipment trials with Alfred and his habit of making the logo on his chest heavily armoured—and manages to shut down the robot. Hush then proceeds to attempt to hack the Bat- Wraith, which forces Bruce to use the self-destruct. Terry subsequently attempts to trap Hush by posing as current Bat-foe Mad Stan, only to be defeated and exposed by Hush's use of Shriek's technology. Hush unmasks himself, appearing to be a bitter and enraged Dick Grayson.Batman Beyond #4 (September 2010). DC Comics. He spares Bruce and Terry so that they can witness him in action saving Gotham. Bruce then directs the new Catwoman on how to treat Terry's injuries. The new Hush is subsequently revealed as a clone of Grayson. Waller, determined to provide the world with a Batman, cloned Grayson based on DNA and memory readings taken after Grayson's last fight as Nightwing. Waller believed that Grayson was more stable than Bruce and would therefore be easier to control. Doctor Reid also reveals herself to be the granddaughter of the original Hush (Nora Elliot before her marriage), seeking to atone for her grandfather's sins.Batman Beyond #5 (October 2010). DC Comics. Hush sends a transmission to the Batcave, revealing that he has taken control of the Bat-Wraiths. He threatens to destroy Gotham in order to save it by setting off bombs along a fault line and triggering a new earthquake. The wounded Terry is aided by Dick Grayson despite Bruce and Terry's concerns about his old injuries. They are joined by Catwoman who is seeking revenge for Hush's attack on her. The three track down Hush, but are unable to convince him that he is merely a clone. The group is only able to defeat him when Bruce temporarily overrides Hush's control of the Bat-Wraiths. Hush is then accidentally impaled and killed on a Bat-Wraith when Terry throws him off of the real Grayson, the clone being impaled by a Bat-Wraith coming out of a pit that it had previously fallen into before both fall back into the pit. Terry grimly notes that the lack of a body means they can only think the clone is dead rather than being sure of it. Waller later had Reid taking the blames for Hush's actions in order to continue her work.Batman Beyond #6 (November 2010).

Thinking that he was truly Bruce Wayne, Ratcatcher tried to kill him but was disappointed when Hush's bandages came off and his scars were revealed. Two Gotham cops tried to help Hush also believing that he was Wayne, but were overwhelmed by Ratcatcher's rats. Arkham Knight, who'd been following Hush, saved him from Ratcatcher and both of them escaped before Batman showed up. In a safehouse, Hush was patched up and given a sample of Clayface mud that would heal his surgery scars on the proviso that he would not reveal his new face again until the plan was ready. In other media =Television= Animation *Hush was originally going to be featured in a planned DTV set on the animated series The Batman, along with that universe's versions of Riddler, Catwoman, Joker, Clayface, Mr. Freeze and Penguin. The project was later scrapped by DC and The WB. There is some sketch art of Hush in Legions of Gotham. Hush was also going to be introduced in the episode \\"Rumors\\", written by Joseph Kuhr. DC did not like the idea, and the villain Rumor (voiced by Ron Perlman) was created in his place. Live-action *Tommy Elliot makes his live-action debut in the television series Gotham, portrayed by Cole Vallis in season 1 and by Gordon Winarick in season 4. He is a student at Bruce Wayne's school Anders Preparatory Academy. Tommy Elliot first appears in the episode \\"The Mask\\", where he makes fun of Bruce's recently deceased mother and then beats Bruce up. With Alfred Pennyworth's encouragement after training him how to fight, Bruce later shows up at Tommy's door and beats him to a pulp with his father's old watch. Alfred ends Bruce's attack and advises Tommy not to talk about anything negative about Bruce's parents next time he sees him. Bruce and Alfred then leave Tommy's residence. In the episode \\"A Day in the Narrows\\", Tommy no longer causes problems for Bruce and has repented for what he did to him claiming that he acted like a jerk the last time they interacted. Bruce joins Tommy, Grace Blomdhal, Brant Jones and Emma Hsueh for a night on the town, where Bruce buys a nightclub and gets Tommy, Grace and Emma, but not Grant, into the club. In the episode \\"Let Them Eat Pie\\", after Bruce cuts his camping trip with Alfred short, he invites Tommy and some friends for a party at Wayne Manor, until Alfred shows up and ends the party. Tommy tries to defend Bruce, but Bruce breaks it up and tells him and his friends to wait for him outside. *Hush appears in Batwoman portrayed by Gabriel Mann as Tommy Elliot/Hush and by Warren Christie when posing as Bruce Wayne. Tommy debuts in episode \\"Down Down Down\\", his childhood friendship with Bruce Wayne is intact here, but Tommy is depicted as a real estate mogul with a grudge against Wayne Enterprises. He leaves Kate an invitation to a gala celebrating the purchase of a building overlooking Wayne Tower. This gala is attended by Jacob Kane and his family. When Kate figures out that Tommy stole a rail gun from a Wayne Enterprise facility, he states to Kate that he figured out Batman's identity thanks to someone who 'riddled' him the identity. He tampers with the elevators that Kate's family, Sophie Moore, Tyler and some waiting staff members are on in order to draw out Batman, where he drops the elevator containing the waiting staff as a warning. After redesigning her bat-suit, Batwoman confronts Tommy and fights him while saving the elevators from being dropped. Before Tommy can take advantage of Batwoman's occupied state, he is knocked out by Alice. When Tommy is arrested and states that they can't keep him in jail, Kate states that he is en route to Arkham Asylum where he can't buy his way out of. In the episode \\"A Narrow Escape,\\" Tommy crashes Dr. M. Butler's therapy session with Alice, Mouse, and some other patients as he rants about having taught Bruce Wayne all he knows; where he also insults a patient who thinks she's a cat and another, Magpie, a myna instead. In the hall, Alice provokes Tommy to stab her (to acquire a shank) causing him to be placed in solitary confinement. It was discovered by Batwoman and Luke Fox that Crows operative Miguel Robles was contracted/paid by Tommy to steal Lucius Fox's journal which led to Lucius' accidental killing and Reggie Harris' being framed for murder. In the episode \\"If You Believe in Me, I'll Believe in You,\\" Alice and Mouse, now under the disguise of Arkham Dr. Butler, visit Tommy to inform him that the Crows will be coming to see if he is worthy of a trial. They cut a deal with him to obtain Lucius Fox's journals back from the hands of Tommy's money launderer Johnny Sabatino, revealing they're able to disguise Tommy with the face of anyone he desires. Alice and Mouse facilitate his escape by switching disguises/faces with an unnamed inmate to pose as Tommy who's supposedly hung himself. When Sabatino refuses to release the journal, Alice has Magpie released to steal it from him. By the end of the first season, Alice works on a new face for Hush that resembles the face of Bruce Wayne. =Film= *Hush appears in Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants, voiced by Dave B. Mitchell. He appears as an inmate at Arkham Asylum who claims he does not belong there and needs to be released to an uncaring Penguin, who just walks by him. *According to some concept art, Hush was originally planned to be featured in The Lego Batman Movie. *Hush features as the main antagonist in the 2019 animated film Batman: Hush, voiced by Geoffrey Arend.https://www.dccomics.com/blog/2018/07/20/batman-hush-is-getting-an- animated-movie In the film, Hush is revealed to be Riddler after using the Lazarus Pit to revitalize himself after brain cancer. As a side effect, he finds he knows the answer to Batman’s identity: Bruce Wayne. As Hush, he targets Batman’s close friends and loved ones by sending multiple villains after them. By the end of the film, the side effects of the Pit begin to wear off allowing Batman to taunt and defeat him although is killed by Selina. **Tommy Elliot voiced by Maury Sterling also is featured in the film as Bruce's oldest friend and the operator of Riddler's brain tumor. Similar to the comic story, Elliot was seen shot outside the opera with the Joker holding a gun, but instead is killed by Hush. His body was later seen in the climax where Batman mourns him while saving Catwoman from Hush. *The Jason Todd version of Hush appears in one of the alternate storylines in the interactive film Batman: Death in the Family. If the viewer has Jason cheat death after his assault from the Joker, he is traumatized by the incident and views himself as a victim of Batman's crusade. He runs away from home and becomes a violent vigilante waging a war on Batman and Gotham's criminal underworld. He wears the same Robin outfit he wore when disguised as Hush in the Batman: Hush storyline. The bandages on his face cover up his burn scars from the warehouse explosion caused by the Joker that nearly killed him. =Video games= Lego Batman *Hush is a playable character in Lego Batman: The Videogame. He can be unlocked after rescuing all the civilian hostages throughout the game. He uses two handguns as weapons, and can build objects and shoot faster than other characters. When left idle, he raises his hand to his mouth and makes a \\"hush\\" expression. He is also unlockable through the \\"Villain Hunt\\" minigame in the Nintendo DS version. *Hush appears in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, voiced by Nolan North. He appears as a boss fight and an unlockable playable character. *Nolan North reprises his role as Hush in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. Batman: Arkham *While Hush does not make a direct appearance in Batman: Arkham Origins, he is mentioned by Alfred as having called to invite Bruce over for a celebration with alcohol, following a successful surgery that he performed on a pair of conjoined twins (the Abramovici brothers). Alfred also states that during the call Elliot was slurring his words and was \\"none too pleased\\" to learn that Bruce could not join him that night, to which Bruce replies, \\"that's Tommy\\", signifying friendship and a familiarity with Elliot's personality. Bruce agrees to call him back later, unaware of his old friend's vendetta. In Bane's hideout, there are newspapers that state the \\"Identity Thief\\" has struck again, foreshadowing the events in Arkham City. *While Hush does not physically appear in the video game Batman: Arkham Asylum, Thomas Elliot's name is featured on an asylum schedule inside Arkham's old medical building. The notice in question seems to indicate that Elliot works double shifts at the facility. *Hush appears in the Batman: Arkham City, side mission \\"Identity Theft\\", voiced by Kevin Conroy. Initially part of an independent medical team working inside Arkham City to service the prisoners, he was implicated in the theft of aid supplies. Prior to being confronted, Elliot reportedly removed his face. Over the course of the game's storyline, Hush resurfaces as a serial killer who dissects his victims' faces before brutally murdering them – earning the moniker 'Identity Thief' from the Gotham press. Although these actions were written off by Arkham City's private security force as the product of gang disputes, Batman proves more diligent in his investigation – allowing players to track his quarry to a crude surgery theatre. It is revealed that Hush is now mimicking Bruce Wayne down to the smallest detail, having used Arkham City inmates as \\"donors\\" for his facial reconstruction. Elliott, apparently ignorant to Wayne's double identity, remains at large, warning that he will continue seeking revenge on his childhood acquaintance. *Kevin Conroy reprises his role as Hush in Batman: Arkham Knight, where he is the focus of the Most Wanted side mission \\"Friend in Need\\". Although he is not seen in costume, he appears disguised as Bruce Wayne. During the midst of Scarecrow's takeover of Gotham City, Hush impersonates Bruce Wayne (following the events of Batman: Arkham City where his face was grafted to look identical to Wayne) and enters Wayne Tower. He captures Lucius Fox to bypass the retina scan to steal his former friend's fortune. When confronted by Batman, the Dark Knight reveals his identity of Bruce Wayne to Hush. When Hush turns his gun on Batman during the confusion, the Caped Crusader disarms him and Lucius Fox slams a glass jar onto his face, before Batman knocks him out. As Batman cannot take Hush to the Gotham City Police Department, he tells Lucius Fox to lock him up in Wayne Tower's vault. Batman then contacts Alfred stating that Hush has been detained and will be brought to trial once Scarecrow's takeover is thwarted. Other games *Hush appears in DC Universe Online, voiced by J.

It was developed and published by Square Enix. It is the eighth game of the Mana series and the third entry in the World of Mana subseries, following the release of Children of Mana nine months prior and Friends of Mana two months prior. Set in a high fantasy universe, Dawn of Mana follows a young hero, Keldric, as he journeys to close a portal to a land of darkness that has been opened in the base of the Tree of Mana and is corrupting the world. While it contains some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles of the series to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to reset to his base abilities with each new zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component. Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and produced by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script was written by Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito. It is the final game in the series to direct development by Square Enix. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide by the end of 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music as beautiful and lush, they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and frustrating, and the story trite. Gameplay Keldric using the whip to throw one enemy at another. The lower left corner show his level, health, and items, the lower right shows Faye's level and mana, as well as the equipped spell and number of pebbles, while the upper right shows the map. Unlike previous games in the Mana series, Dawn of Mana takes place in a full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous games in the series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip can grab and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player. The combat system in Dawn of Mana is called the Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, including enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up to a maximum of four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible. The game is divided into eight chapters and a prologue; at the end of each chapter, the player is graded on their performance, and all of their statistics and medals are reset. The only items which carry over between chapters are emblems, which are given to the player for achieving high scores in a chapter or defeating hidden monsters. High scores are achieved by defeating more enemies, and defeating enemies with high Panic meters. In addition to the main game is a challenge arena, accessible through the main menu, where Keldric can fight timed battles against powerful foes. Keldric can fight alongside AI-controlled pets in these challenges, found in eggs throughout the game. The challenge arena also contains a shop, which contains emblems, eggs, and bonuses like extra music or higher game difficulties, which can be bought with money dropped by enemies throughout the game. Plot Dawn of Mana opens on the fictional island of Illusia, a place where the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a continent composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them. Keldric and Faye, with the help of the great beast, Flammie, force the Lorimarian army to leave the village. They chase after Stroud, catching up to him at the coast. There they free Ritzia, only to be attacked by Stroud, wielding the other part of the key—the Sword of Mana. Keldric is thrown off of Stroud's airship, and the Lorimarians invade Illusia again. Stroud opens the portal, and a wave of dark energy is released, transforming the Tree, turning the people of Illusia into monsters called Grimlies, and releasing dark monsters from Mavolia. Keldric and Faye flee, and head for Fa'Diel. A year of wandering later, the dark energy has begun to affect other countries in Fa'Diel. Keldric discovers in Jadd that Ritzia plans to release the Mavolian energy to cover the whole world. He and Faye journey back to Illusia, only to discover Ritzia seemingly possessed and saying that it is their destiny to rule the world. After she runs away, Keldric meets a masked stranger who tells him that he was the one to close the portal centuries ago, sealing up the Maiden who had opened it, Anise, inside. He also reveals that Stroud is Keldric's older brother. When Keldric and Faye reach the portal, they find Stroud and Ritzia fighting. Stroud is trying to prevent Ritzia, possessed by Anise, from destroying the world, but is being mutated by the dark energy. Keldric defeats the mutated Stroud, and then fights Ritzia. Realizing that the only way to close the portal is to defeat Anise, he is forced to kill Ritzia along with her. The spirits of Ritzia and Faye then merge with the Tree of Mana, the portal is sealed, and Illusia is restored. Development In 2003, Square Enix began a drive to begin developing \\"polymorphic content\\", a marketing and sales strategy to \\"[provide] well-known properties on several platforms, allowing exposure of the products to as wide an audience as possible\\". The first of these was the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, and Square Enix intended to have campaigns for other series whereby multiple games in different genres would be developed simultaneously. In early 2005, Square Enix announced a \\"World of Mana\\" project, the application of this \\"polymorphic content\\" idea to the Mana franchise, which would include several games across different genres and platforms. These games, as with the rest of the series, would not be direct sequels or prequels to one another, even if appearing so at first glance, but would instead share thematic connections. The third release in this project and the eighth release in the Mana series was announced in September 2005 as Seiken Densetsu 4, the first 3D game in the series, though no other details were given in favor of promoting the first game, Children of Mana. Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and produced by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script was written by Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato. The main objective of the development team was to convert the entire Mana world into a 3D environment, rather than just starting from scratch graphically and adding new elements to the gameplay. Ishii had previously wanted to make the 1999 PlayStation game Legend of Mana a 3D game, but the console had been unable to handle his vision of the player interacting with natural shaped objects in a full 3D world. He wanted to create a Mana title that could explore \\"the feeling of touch\\" in a game. After seeing the Havok physics engine in a demo of Half-Life 2 at E3 in 2004, Ishii decided to use the system in Dawn to give players a visual link between environments, objects, and characters. He hoped the physics engine and 3D graphics would allow him \\"to create a world where players utilize a variety of actions to alter the world and the objects contained within\\". Although Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, he has also asserted in an interview that Dawn is set ten years before Children of Mana, which depicts the aftermath of the \\"cataclysm\\" of Dawn. =Music= The score for Dawn of Mana was composed by Kenji Ito, while Tsuyoshi Sekito and Masayoshi Soken contributed numerous tracks and Grammy Award-winning musician and film composer Ryuichi Sakamoto wrote the theme song, \\"Dawn of Mana\\". Tracks originally composed for earlier games in the series by Ito, Hiroki Kikuta, and Yoko Shimomura were also arranged for Dawn of Mana by the main three composers. Sekito focused on the game's boss themes, while Soken worked on other battle music. Ito had previously composed the music for the first game in the Mana series, Final Fantasy Adventure (1991), as well as its 2003 remake Sword of Mana, and for the 2006 Children of Mana. This was the first soundtrack in the Mana series to feature work by Sekito, Soken, or Sakamoto, though Sekito and Soken had worked for Square Enix previously on other titles. The music of the game covers a range of styles, including rock, classical, and orchestral. Sakamoto drew inspiration for the theme song from the image of the Mana tree shown at the title screen of the game. The album Seiken Densetsu 4 Original Soundtrack -Sanctuary- collects 106 tracks from Children of Mana on four discs and is nearly four and a half hours in length. It was published by Square Enix on January 24, 2007. A promotional album, Breath of Mana, was released along with preorders of the game in Japan on December 21, 2006. The thirteen-minute disc contains five orchestral and piano songs, all composed by Ito, three of which did not appear on the full soundtrack album. Reception Dawn of Mana sold over 229,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006, ten days after release, and was the top-selling PlayStation 2 title in Japan during its release week. As of November 2008 it had sold over 340,000 copies in Japan. The game sold 70,000 copies in North America by November 2007. Upon its release, Dawn of Mana received generally poor reviews over a wide range, with numerical scores that range from 30 to 80 out of 100. Reviewers praised Dawn of Mana's graphics and character design; GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd called it colorful and \\"pretty\\", and praised the particle effects, while a reviewer for GameTrailers noted the \\"gorgeous in-game cinematics\\". Gabe Graziani of GameSpy also called out the cinematics in his review, calling them \\"beautifully rendered and animated\\" and the highlight of the game. IGN's Jeff Haynes liked the scale and variety of the 3D environments and called out the character models as worthy of praise. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, described the level design as \\"chaotic\\" despite the \\"charming, candy-coated graphics\\". Joe Juba and Matt Miller of Game Informer said that the environments are \\"pretty bland\\", but praised the rest of the graphics heavily. Michael Beckett of RPGamer said that \\"Dawn of Mana's visual style is highly impressive\\" and especially praised the character design and color palette. The music was also praised; VanOrd called it \\"the highlight of the sound design\\" and the GameTrailers reviewer claimed that Dawn of Mana had a \\"lush soundtrack filling every moment of the game\\". Beckett also praised the music, and noted the callbacks in the largely orchestral score to previous games in the Mana series. The gameplay was heavily criticized by reviewers such as Fitch of 1UP.com, who disliked both the way the character abilities reset with every new area and the \\"inane\\" and \\"mundane\\" system for collecting emblems, criticisms echoed by GameSpot's VanOrd. The GameTrailers review added that the way the character's levels and abilities reset in each area \\"zaps the sense of accomplishment from the game as a whole\\". Haynes of IGN also found issues with the targeting system for attacking enemies at range, finding it ineffective, and also criticized the leveling system and the game's map. Graziani of GameSpy felt the targeting system was one of the worst parts of Dawn of Mana, along with the camera system—a complaint also raised by Haynes. Both Fitch and VanOrd focused their criticisms of the controls on the Havok physics engine, which they felt was poorly utilized and left the player feeling out of control—unable to aim when throwing objects or easily control the character during the game's jumping sections. Juba of Game Informer felt that the physics engine left the controls \\"laughably uncooperative\\". The game's story was also not seen as a highlight; Graziani called it \\"trite\\" and \\"fan service\\", while Fitch deemed it \\"a bit of a Neverending Story rip-off\\", though a charming one. Beckett of RPGamer called it \\"a somewhat trite tale of boy chases girl\\" and noted \\"a general lack of closure to the story\\". Juba of Game Informer, however, deemed it an \\"interesting plot\\". Both the GameTrailers review and VanOrd praised the \\"charm\\" of the characters, though VanOrd noted that they were making up for an unoriginal plot. Overall, several reviewers felt that Dawn of Mana was a divergence from the rest of the series that did not add as much as it took away; even the notably high-scoring Japanese Famitsu review felt that the change in gameplay would confuse fans and other players.

The story is set before the first seven books in the series, and follows the early days of the title character's journalism career. Fletch scores his first big interview, only to have the subject turn up dead in the newspaper's parking lot. He investigates, beginning his dual profession of journalist and investigator. A film adaptation of the novel has been in development for some time with a number of different persons attached. Plot summary During what is effectively a prequel, Fletch has only been at the News-Tribune as a junior reporter for a short time and Frank (his editor) is losing respect for his new employee. Frank moves Fletch to a different section of the newspaper more than once, but Fletch continues to cause trouble. When Fletch is to run the story of local lawyer Donald Habeck, who requests an interview in order to announce that he is giving 5 million dollars to a local museum, the lawyer turns up dead in the News-Tribune parking lot. Unsurprisingly Frank takes Fletch off the story and gives it to an experienced reporter who has been with the paper for years. Fletch is now charged with investigating a whorehouse—which he does. However, he is not about to give up on the Habeck story, the circumstances of which seem mighty suspicious, especially when Fletch starts to suspect that the legal firm Habeck worked for is one of the most crooked firms around.

Background Dr. Shazia Khalid is married to Khalid Zafar, a pipeline engineer. In 2005 Dr. Shazia was an employee of Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and working at the company's Sui hospital for the past 18 months while living alone in accommodation provided by PPL. Security services for the entire facility was provided by the Defence Services Group (DSG).The Dr. Shazia Case Press Statement Joint Action Committee for People's Rights She had taken the job only after PPL had also promised a job for her husband. The job, however, never materialised.Another Face of Terror Rape On the night of 2 January and in the early morning hours of 3 January 2005, Dr. Shazia was awoken by somebody pulling her hair. She was then strangled with a cord, threatened, blindfolded, pistol-whipped, beaten and repeatedly raped by a masked intruder, at Sui, Dera Bugti, in the heavily guarded government-owned natural gas plant. She was severely injured in the attack but managed to cut her hands free of the cord and sought help from a nurse, Sakina, at the nearby nursing hostel. Sakina then informed the administration of PPL and the DCMO; the medical staff on duty, Dr Mohammad Ali, Dr Irshad, Dr Saima Siddiqui, nurse Firdous and Salimullah visited Dr. Shazia. Her pleas to contact her husband (who was working in Libya at the time) and her family were ignored.Rape victim under pressure to keep mum Instead of treating her medically, officials were said to have drugged her into unconsciousness with sedatives for three days to keep her quiet and then transferred her to a psychiatric hospital, Asghar Psychiatric Hospital, in Karachi.kristof.html Another Face of Terror House arrest Her husband, Khalid, in Libya at the time, rushed back to Pakistan to be reunited with his wife. With his support, Shazia reported the crime.Shazia Khalid – Twice Violated Following the report, for a period of 2 months, she was put under house arrest in a house in Karachi under the \\"unofficial protection\\" of the police, army and Musharraf officials and was not allowed access to doctors, lawyers or visitors of her choice.Musharraf’s Rape Cover-Up In addition, the crime scene and anything that could be considered as evidence, including the clothes of Dr. Shazia, were tampered with or destroyed. When her family was informed some days later, Dr. Shazia and her family were told to keep quiet and dissuaded to register the rape case or speak to the media by the PPL Company representatives, who denied the rape to the media.Shazia Khalid and the fight for justice in Pakistan Her husband Khalid said, his grandfather demanded that Khalid divorce her, because he felt, her rape had rendered her a stain on the family honour. Khalid refused. So the grandfather assembled a mob to kill Shazia.I am not expecting justice: Dr Shazia Her case led to a violent uprising by the Bugti tribe in Baluchistan province, disrupting the supply of gas to much of the country for several weeks. By some accounts, up to 10,000 soldiers and police were brought in to quell the rebellion. As the Pakistani authorities attacked the Bugti, President Musharraf promised that the tribesmen would \\"not know what hit them.\\" and attacks on the Bugti tribesmen were intensified.Musharraf’s Rape Cover-Up An unusual development occurred, when the then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf entered the controversy, stating on national television, that the accused officer, named as Captain Hammad, was \\"not guilty\\", which led to criticism of Musharraf, a military man himself.Sherry points out loopholes in Dr Shazia’s rape probe Both politicians as well as Pakistani human rights lawyer, Asma Jahangir voiced their criticism and concerns following the statement.Land, Gold and Women Part 2: The case of Shazia Khalid Threats In an interview with the BBC, Dr. Shazia said that she was threatened many times. \\"I cannot tell you how many times I was threatened. My life was made impossible. I am still terrified.\\" \\"My whole career was destroyed, as was my husband's.

She applied for asylum in Canada, where she has relatives, but her application was refused. In August 2005 New York Times columnist Nicholas D. Kristof wrote several articles about Dr. Shazia's story and urged readers to write to the Canadian minister of citizenship and Immigration asking the Canadian government to reconsider. As of 26 September 2005, Dr. Shazia was still stranded in the UK awaiting the result of her application for asylum in the UK. She expressed great regret in being forced to leave her country, her adopted son and family, her career and life behind for a future unknown.

It is a member of Notoungulata, one of several now extinct orders of hoofed mammals indigenous to South America. It was among the largest and last members of its order, and was probably the most common large hoofed mammal in South America of its time.  Taxonomy  Skeletal diagram Toxodon was one of the last members of Notoungulata, a group of ungulates that had been part of the fauna of South America since the Paleocene. Toxodon was a member of Toxodontidae a large bodied group including similar, vaguely rhinoceros like forms. Charles Darwin was one of the first to collect Toxodon fossils, after paying 18 pence for a T. platensis skull from a farmer in Uruguay. In The Voyage of the Beagle Darwin wrote, \\"November 26th - I set out on my return in a direct line for Monte Video. Having heard of some giant's bones at a neighbouring farm-house on the Sarandis, a small stream entering the Rio Negro, I rode there accompanied by my host, and purchased for the value of eighteen pence the head of the Toxodon.\\" Since Darwin discovered that the fossils of similar mammals of South America were different from those in Europe, he invoked many debates about the evolution and natural selection of animals. In his own words, Darwin wrote down in his journal, \\"Lastly, the Toxodon, perhaps one of the strangest animals ever discovered: in size it equaled an elephant or megatherium, but the structure of its teeth, as Mr. Owen states, proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the Gnawers, the order which, at the present day, includes most of the smallest quadrupeds: in many details it is allied to the Pachydermata: judging from the position of its eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was probably aquatic, like the Dugong and Manatee, to which it is also allied. How wonderfully are the different Orders, at the present time so well separated, blended together in different points of the structure of the Toxodon!\\" Analysis of collagen sequences obtained from Toxodon as well as from Macrauchenia found that South America's native notoungulates and litopterns form a sister group to perissodactyls, making them true ungulates. This finding has been corroborated by an analysis of mitochondrial DNA extracted from a Macrauchenia fossil, which yielded a date of 66 Ma for the time of the split with perissodactyls. = Evolution = In 2014, a study identifying a new species of toxodontid resolved the phylogenetic relations of the toxodontids, including to Toxodon. The below cladogram was found by the study:  Description  Toxodon was about in body length, with an estimated weight up to and about high at the shoulder and resembled a heavy rhinoceros, with a short and vaguely hippopotamus-like head. Because of the position of its nasal openings, it is believed that Toxodon had a well-developed snout. Toxodon possessed a large, barrel shaped body. It had short stout legs with plantigrade feet with three functional relatively short toes. The hind limbs are longer and raised higher than the front limbs, giving a sloped appearance to the body. Like horses, it had a stay apparatus allowing the knees to be passively locked while standing.Shockey BJ. 2001. \\"Specialized knee joints in some extinct, endemic, South American herbivores\\" Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 46:277–88 The vertebrae were equipped with high apophyses, which most likely supported the massive weight and muscles as well as its powerful head. Toxodon had broad jaws which were filled with bow shaped teeth and incisors. The teeth of Toxodon have no roots and are ever-growing (euhypsodont) like those of rodents and lagomorphs, and often exhibit enamel hypoplasia.  Palaeobiology  Toxodon skull in front view It was initially believed to have been amphibious, but after examining the proportions of the femur and tibia, as well as the position of its head, below the top of the spinal column, palaeontologists realized that it had features similar to terrestrial animals such as elephants or rhinoceroses. The fossils are also usually found in arid and semi-arid areas, typically an indication of a primarily terrestrial life. Toxodon would have had a very unusual gait, due to its peculiar proportions. It may have galloped to escape predators, but like a rhino, it probably relied more on its size as protection against predators. Toxodon is believed to have been ecologically plastic, with its diet varying according to local conditions, with an almost totally C3 browsing diet in the Amazon rainforest, mixed feeding C3 in Bahia and the Pampas to almost completely C4 dominated grazing diet in the Chaco.  Extinction  Toxodon became extinct at the beginning of the Holocene as part of the Quaternary extinction event, alongside almost all other large animals in South America. Previous mid-Holocene dates are now thought to be in error. Remains from the Arroyo Seco 2 site in the Pampas have been interpreted to be the result of butchery, suggesting that human hunting was a contributing factor to extinction. Restoration of T. platensis Toxodon skull, Zoologisk Museum, Copenhagen  Distribution  Restoration of Toxodon platensis Toxodon has a wide distribution in South America during the Late Pleistocene, extending from the Pampas into the Amazon rainforest.

The Stellar was launched in July 1983. The Stellar was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, but the chassis from the Cortina Mk V was kept. Technology 1985 Hyundai Stellar 1986 Hyundai Stellar with larger bumpers (Europe). 1987 Hyundai Stellar CXL (Canada) 1989 GSL exported to Sri Lanka The engine and transmission were licensed from Mitsubishi Motors. Engines available were 1.4 L (4G33, same as the Hyundai Pony) and 1.6 L (4G32) inline-fours until 1986, using either a KM119 4- or 5-speed manual or a Borg-Warner 03-55L 3-speed automatic) and a 2.0 L engine for 1987. Trim levels included L (base), GL/CL/SL, and CXL/GSL. The CXL/GSL featured power windows, locks and mirrors; remote fuel door, remote trunk, premium sound system, full instrumentation (speed, tach, fuel, water temp, volts, and oil pressure), headlamp washers and available air conditioning, a rather surprising list of features for the year and type of car. The Stellar's Ford genes and conventional design led many British observers to compare it with the then recently discontinued Cortina - where conservative buyers were scared off by the Sierra's radical styling, a fact played upon by Hyundai's advertising agency with print advertisements depicting a jelly/jello mold shaped like the Sierra, above a picture of the Stellar. Like the Cortina, the Stellar also has wishbone suspension up front with a coil sprung live rear axle. As well as being comparable to the Cortina, which had been Britain's best selling car, it also found favour with buyers due to its competitive asking price, which meant that it was priced comparably to a smaller Escort rather than a Sierra. It was sold in Britain from June 1984 until the arrival of the Lantra during 1991. It was the second Hyundai model to be imported to Europe, two years after the launch of the smaller Pony. For 1987, the car was refreshed with the name changed to Stellar II (or Stellar 2.0 in Canada) in many markets. Changes included a 2-way catalytic converter, new instrument cluster, larger 2.0 L Mitsubishi 4G63 engine (SOHC with eight valves) with a feedback two-barrel carburetor, higher output alternator, larger headlights and restyled taillights. The front double wishbone suspension was changed to a MacPherson strut design, along with larger brake calipers, as well as a two-piece driveshaft. The Stellar had the option of riding on several types of aluminum alloy wheels, and was equipped standard with Michelin all-season tires (Canada). Also that year, an automatic transmission (Borg Warner 03-71) with overdrive was available as an option. In the domestic Korean market, this was the first of their cars to be sold as the Sonata. In Europe, the Stellar II is sometimes referred to as the Stellar Prima. This was only limited to the new 2.0 GSL model, thus differing from the continued 1.6 models. The 2.0 GSL \\"Prima\\" received new, larger bumpers, restyled lights and updated dashboard, while the 1.6 GSL kept the original design which was also continued for the 1.6 SL and 1.6 L. The 1.4 models were discontinued for the 1987 model year. The Stellar was not available in the United States due to strict emission standards there, but it was available in Canada and other countries. In addition, the Stellar was the only inexpensive four-cylinder powered rear-wheel drive sedan after the Toyota Corolla shifted to front-wheel drive in 1984 and the Daihatsu Charmant was discontinued in 1987. The Stellar was replaced in Canada and Europe by the Hyundai New Sonata for 1992. In the Korean domestic market, the lower end of the Stellar lineup can be considered as having been replaced by the Sonata. The Stellar (along with the Pony) would be Hyundai's last rear-wheel drive cars for North America until the 2009 Genesis.

Early life Griffin played high school baseball at El Monte High School in California, graduating in 1965, where he achieved All-Pacific League, All-Valley, and All-California Interscholastic Federation honors. He also lettered in basketball, football and track. Professional career Griffin was drafted in the 21st round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft by the California Angels, and played in their minor league organization until his call-up in 1970. After 18 games with the Angels, in which he hit .127 with four RBI in 62 games, he was traded to the Red Sox in a six-player trade that sent popular outfielder Tony Conigliaro to the Angels. Griffin was the Red Sox' regular second baseman from 1971 until mid-1975. He was not a particularly good hitter, posting modest batting averages with few walks and very little power, but instead he was an excellent fielder, winning a Gold Glove Award in 1972. In June 1975, the Red Sox acquired veteran second baseman Denny Doyle from the Angels, and for the rest of the season, the left-handed-hitting Doyle was the Red Sox's primary second baseman, with the right-handed-hitting Griffin starting only against left- handed pitchers. Griffin did not appear in the American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, and made only one brief appearance in the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Griffin suffered numerous injuries during his professional career. On April 30, 1974, Griffin was beaned by a Nolan Ryan fastball, knocking him unconscious. The beaning left him with a concussion and temporary hearing loss. On August 30, 1975, he was beaned again, this time by Oakland's Dick Bosman. Griffin experienced hearing and equilibrium problems, but recovered very quickly. This time he had been wearing an ear flap with his protective helmet. Griffin played only sparingly in 1976, and was released after playing in only five games in 1977. Later life After baseball, Griffin worked in construction. First with his father in the 1970s, and later for Buddy LeRoux in the 1980s. On July 27, 2016, Griffin died after a long illness. Personal life Griffin had two children, Natalie and Chad, and six grandchildren.

It is a prequel of the NES Ninja Gaiden trilogy. Plot Set three years before the events of the first Ninja Gaiden (NES), the player controls Ryu Hayabusa, who must save New York City from the forces of Emperor Garuda, a servant of Jaquio. Garuda's minions include the cyborg \\"Spider\\", kickboxer Gregory and his manager Jack, former military commander Colonel Allen, and the Japanese nobleman . Gameplay Screenshot of the game's First Act. Ninja Gaiden Shadow features simplified play mechanics compared to those used in the NES trilogy. In contrast to the variety of ninja arts and power-ups available in the NES games, Ryu only has a basic sword attack and a Fire Wheel attack that can be replenished for up to five uses. While Ryu cannot stick to or climb walls like in the NES games, he can hang onto railings and move underneath them like in Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom, and use both his sword attack and the Fire Wheel art while hanging onto railings. Unique to this installment, is Ryu being equipped with a grappling hook that allows him to latch onto hard-to-reach railings. Like in the NES versions, Ryu can find health potions, fire wheel stocks, and extra lives by destroying item containers.

It is situated between Houthem and Berg en Terblijt. History The name Geulhem was first mentioned in an act dating from 1360. The interpretation of the name is \\"hamlet on the river Geul\\". At the centre of Geulhem is its oldest building - the Geulhemmer watermill. This watermill existed before 1306. Geulhem is situated partially in a valley and partially on a hillside known as the Geulhemmerberg. Places of interest Geulhemmergroeve tunnels near Geulhem, The Netherlands. Next to the Geulhemer watermill, which is now in use as a cafe, one finds himself in the environs of an underground network of corridors under the \\"Geulhemmerberg\\" hill. In the past, parts of this network were used as cave dwellings due to marl excavation. Part of the cave dwellings were restored and can be viewed on a group tour. At the entrance of the Geulhemmercave there is a marlstone statue of a 'block breaker' - the craftsman who, in the past, excavated blocks of marlstone with the help of primitive tools. In Geulhem there is also a romantic castle - Castle Geulzicht - which was built at the end of the nineteenth century and is now in use as a hotel. It was developed by the architect Henri Reek and commissioned by Zuyderhoudt; its design is in the English Neo-Gothic style. Geulhem is a much loved holiday destination due its closeness to the sloped woods and the availability of many different hotels.

He was first elected to Scarborough Township council following World War II, and was elected reeve of the township in 1956, unseating eight-term incumbent Oliver Crockford. After being defeated by Albert Campbell in the following year's election, he went on to return to Scarborough council and served on the Board of Control when the township became a borough and then a city in 1983. Although he was a relatively conservative, pro-development mayor, Harris' political roots were in the labour movement, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the New Democratic Party.

The guéridon originated in France towards the middle of the 17th century. The supports for early guéridons were often modeled on ancient Egyptian and Greek as well as various African human traditional figures (inspired by caryatids). While often serving humble purposes, such as to hold a candlestick or vase, the guéridon could be a high-style decorative piece of court furniture. By the time of Louis XIV's death in 1715, there were several hundred guéridons at Versailles, and within a generation they had taken an infinity of forms: columns, tripods, termini and mythological figures. Some of the simpler and more artistic forms were of wood carved with familiar decorative motives and gilded. Silver, enamel, and indeed almost any material from which furniture can be made, have been used for their construction. A variety of small occasional tables are now called guéridons in French.

Burgers. Burgers studied in Leiden under Paul Ehrenfest, where he obtained his PhD in 1918. He is credited to be the father of Burgers' equation, the Burgers vector in dislocation theory and the Burgers material in viscoelasticity. Jan Burgers was one of the co-founders of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) in 1946, and was its secretary-general from 1946 until 1952. In 1931 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in 1955 he became foreign member.  Early life and education  Burgers was born in Arnhem, Netherlands. There he attended both primary and secondary school. He attended Leiden University from 1914 until 1917. Burgers became a Doctor of Mathematical and Physical Sciences in 1918, writing a thesis entitled \\"Het Atoommodel van Rugherford-Bohr\\" (The Model of the Atom according to Rutherford and Bohr).  Career  Jan Burgers took his first position out of graduate school as Conservator at the Physical Laboratory of the Teyler's Stichting Foundation. From September 1918 until October 1955, Dr. Burgers was professor of Aerodynamics and Hydrodynamics at the Delft University of Technology. He was also secretary of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Shipbuilding (1921-1924) and later the department's chairman (1929-1931). Burgers also worked with scientists including Theodore von Karman, L. Prandt, R. von Mises, G.I. Taylor and W.F. Durand, and Paul Ehrenfest. Jan Burgers researched fluid dynamics, worked on the theory of turbulence, and explored what came to be known as the Burgers' equation. He also studied crystallography with his brother Wilhelm G. Burgers. Burgers and his wife, Anna immigrated to the United States in 1955 where Burgers accepted a position of research professor at the Institute for Physical Dynamics and Applied Mathematics (now the Institute for Physical Science and Technology) at the University of Maryland, College Park. Burgers continued his interest in fluid dynamics while at the University of Maryland, and was recognized for his studies in gas dynamics, plasma physics, shock waves, and related phenomena.

Hier. p. 570, where it is called Salamembria. near the southern end of the wall built by Anastasius I Dicorus for the protection of his capital.Procopius, de Aed. 4.9. According to Strabo, its name signifies \\"the town of Selys;\\" from which it has been inferred that Selys was the name of its founder, or of the leader of the colony from Megara, which founded it at an earlier period than the establishment of Byzantium, another colony of the same Greek city-state.Scymn. 714. In honour of Eudoxia, the wife of the emperor Arcadius, its name was changed to Eudoxiupolis or Eudoxioupolis (Εὐδοξιούπολις), which it bore for a considerable time; but the modern name of its site, Silivri, shows that it subsequently resumed its original designation. Respecting the history of Selymbria, only detached and fragmentary notices occur in the Greek writers. In Latin authors, it is merely named; although Pliny the Elder reports that it was said to have been the birthplace of Prodicus, a disciple of Hippocrates. It was here that Xenophon met Medosades, the envoy of Seuthes II, whose forces afterwards encamped in its neighbourhood. When Alcibiades was commanding for the Athenians in the Propontis (410 BCE), the people of Selymbria refused to admit his army into the town, but gave him money, probably in order to induce him to abstain from forcing an entrance. Some time after this, however, he gained possession of the place through the treachery of some of the townspeople, and, having levied a contribution upon its inhabitants, left a garrison in it.Plutarch, Alc. 30; Selymbria is mentioned by Demosthenes in 351 BCE, as in alliance with the Athenians; and it was no doubt at that time a member of the Byzantine confederacy. According to a letter of Philip II of Macedon, quoted in the oration de Corona,Demosthenes, de Corona, p. 251, ed Reiske. it was blockaded by him about 343 BCE; but others consider that this mention of Selymbria is one of the numerous proofs that the documents inserted in that speech are not authentic.See, e.g., Newman, Class. Mus. vol. i. pp. 153, 154. Selymbria had a small, but significant mint, researched by Edith Schönert-Geiß.

This location is referred to as the place where Ishmael is laid to rest. It was also at this location that the path of Lehi's journey changed from a southern to an eastern direction before continuing toward the coast and the land () Bountiful. (See Archaeology and the Book of Mormon.) Some LDS archaeologists believe that they have located the site of Nahom as a settlement and tribal area known anciently and still today as \\"NHM\\" (see below). Critics doubt the link between Nahom and NHM, as well as having other criticisms. Nahom in the Book of Mormon In , Lehi receives the Liahona and his group departs from the Valley of Lemuel. After traveling for four days in \\"nearly a south-southeast direction\\" they make camp in a place they name \\"Shazer.\\" They continue to travel in the \\"same direction\\" for \\"many days\\" with the Liahona as a guide (). Verses 34 and 35 read: In the next four verses, the dissenters plot to kill Lehi and Nephi, but the threat is not carried out. The next verse reports that Lehi's group has resumed their journey and changed the direction of their travel \\"eastward\\" (). Nahom in archaeology LDS scholars have proposed a specific location for Nahom based on archaeological evidences, which overrides previous speculation. Others give a linguistical reason for which the proposed location does not match the Nahom descriptions given in the Book of Mormon. =Ancient frankincense trails= Some scholars believe that Lehi's group followed the ancient frankincense trails in the northern part of Yemen at times during the initial leg of their journey .Reynolds states: \\"Nibley and others note that this simple travel account fits well with what is now known of the ancient trade routes that carried frankincense from Oman and Yemen northward to the Mediterranean markets.\\" The location of NHM is near the main junction of these ancient trails at a point where the trails veer to the east. According to the Book of Mormon, prior to their arrival at Nahom, the travelers had been moving in a \\"south-southeast\\" direction (). It was at this location \\"Nahom\\" that the Book of Mormon states that the travelers made a significant change in direction \\"eastward\\" before continuing their journey toward the coast. The location of NHM and the eastward change in direction have been used by LDS scholars to assist in determining a plausible location for the coastal location referred to by Nephi as Bountiful. =Proposed location of Nahom= In 1976, it was originally speculated by Lynn M. Hilton that Nahom might correlate with the location of the village of Al Qunfudhah, Tanomah, in Saudi Arabia . In 1978 Ross T. Christensen noted the existence of a location in Yemen called \\"Nehhm\\" on an early map produced by Carsten Niebuhr as the result of a scientific expedition sent out by King Frederick V of Denmark . After doing extensive research over several years at the site in Yemen, the location of Nahom was associated with the existing location and tribal name NHM (usually vocalized as NIHM or NEHEM or NAHM) by Warren and Michaela Aston in 1994 . LDS scholars now consider the location and tribal area of NHM in the Jawf Valley in Yemen (15° 51' 0\\" North, 44° 37' 0\\" East, GPS coordinates 15.88, 44.615) to be the only plausible location for the place referred to as Nahom in the Book of Mormon. LDS scholars consider NHM to be one of the locations in the Arabian peninsula that they believe confirms Book of Mormon historicity in the Old World . Terryl Givens states that the discovery of the altars \\"may thus be said to constitute the first actual archaeological evidence for the historicity of the Book of Mormon.\\" This conclusion is based upon archaeological evidence and inscriptions recently found on altars at a specific location in Yemen which appear to correlate with the \\"place called Nahom\\" described in the book of 1 Nephi ,. Nahom is one of only a very few locations mentioned in the Book of Mormon that the text implies had been named prior to contact with the Lehite travelers, in contrast to Lehi's normal application of the Middle Eastern practice of naming locations after family members . Although the actual location of NHM is plausible when compared to Lehi's purported route, his change of direction on the Arabian peninsula, the timeframe (~600 BC) matching the archaeological dates, and the ancient burial ground found there, one non-LDS author has suggested a valid reason why Nahom and NHM may not represent the same location: the pronunciation of NHM is unknown . Altars The Bar'an temple in Marib ( east of San'a in Yemen) was excavated by a German archaeological team led by Burkhard Vogt. Before excavation began, all that was visible at the Bar'an site were six columns projecting above the sand. The temple structure and many of the altars were found to be well preserved by the sand and desert climate . One of the artifacts discovered at this location was an inscribed altar which has been dated to the seventh or sixth centuries BC. According to the inscription, the altar was donated to the temple by \\"Bi'athtar, son of Sawad, son of Naw'an, the Nihmite\\" . The first altar discovered was removed from the Bar'an site and placed in a traveling exhibit which began touring Europe in October 1997. Since that time, two additional altars bearing the same inscription mentioning NHM have been identified at the same temple site . Each of the altars is constructed of solid limestone. All three contain a dedication inscription, which is carved around all four sides of the altars in the South Arabian script of that period, and each bears the name of their donor: Bi'athar . The first altar was dated to between the seventh and sixth centuries B.C by French researcher Christian Robin . Since Naw'um of the tribe of Nihm was the grandfather of Bi'athar, it is estimated that the Nihm tribal name must be at least two generations older than the altars themselves . Nahom and linguistics =Meaning of the name NHM= Vowels in Hebrew are spoken but not written.Introduction to Hebrew Vowels Therefore, roots in Semitic languages such as Hebrew or Arabic utilize only the consonants and not the vowels .Roper states: \\"In Semitic languages such as Hebrew or Arabic, it is the consonants and not the vowels that have lexical value. The vowels have nothing to do with the meaning of the root. Thus it makes little difference whether the name is spelled Nehem, Nehm, Nihm, Nahm, or Naham—the root is the same.\\" Some of the variant names based upon the Semitic root NHM found in both Arabic and Hebrew texts are Nahum, Naham, Nihm, Nehem and Nahm . The root NHM has different meanings. The South Arabian root NHM is related to stone cutting. The Hebrew root NHM is found repeatedly in the Bible and relates to sorrow, hunger, consoling, and mourning .Referring to the root for Naham, Damrosch states \\" It appears twenty-five times in the narrative books of the Bible, and in every case it is associated with death. In family settings, it is applied in instances involving the death of an immediate family member (parent, sibling, or child); in national settings, it has to do with the survival or impending extermination of an entire people. At heart, naham means \\"to mourn,\\" to come to terms with a death.\\" Scholars consider this root appropriate when used to refer to a place of burial and the expression of mourning . This theory is corroborated by a huge area of ancient burial tombs at 'Alam, Ruwayk, and Jidran about north of Marib that were examined by a French team at approximately the same time that the Bar'an excavation was completed. This burial complex is the largest such burial area known anywhere in Arabia . =Early references to NHM= The name NHM denotes both a tribal region and a location in the southern part of Arabia . In 1763 a German surveyor and mapmaker named Carsten Niebuhr produced a map which contained the place name \\"Nehhm\\" at a location approximately twenty-five miles northeast of the Yemen capital Sana'a . In 1792 Robert Heron published a two- volume translation of Niebuhr's first work titled Niebuhr's Travels through Arabia and Other Countries in the East . Niebuhr explained in his book: \\"I have had no small difficulty in writing down these names; both from the diversity of dialects in the country, and from the indistinct pronunciation of those from whom I was obliged to ask them.\\"Niebuhr, Travels through Arabia, 1:35. Niebuhr circles the boundaries of this area of Nehhm on the map; it covers an area of approximately . There is no evidence, however, that Joseph Smith had access to these materials before the publication of the Book of Mormon. Likewise, there is also no evidence that he or one of his acquaintances did not have access to these sources. .Roper states that \\"no American geographical sources published before 1830 mention the site Nahom, although we now know that it is an authentic ancient place name, which occurs only once in the entire region, and that in a location consistent with Nephi's description. Joseph Smith could not have learned about Nahom from early nineteenth-century sources,\\" although it does not preclude the possibility that he or one of his acquaintances learned about them from sources published outside of America. =Link between Nahom and NHM= In the Book of Mormon, Nahom is one of the few locations mentioned in the Book of Mormon that was not named by Lehi, thus suggesting that this was a pre-existing place name. The Book of Mormon states that Ishmael, the patriarch of the family that left with Lehi's, was buried \\"in the place which was called Nahom.\\" It was also at Nahom that the travelers made a significant change in the direction of their travel from \\"south-southeast\\" to \\"nearly eastward.\\" Jeff LindsayFoundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies Criticisms of connection Known criticisms include the following : *The fact that the Book of Mormon does not explicitly mention contact with outsiders during Lehi's journey. *It is suggested that the pronunciation of NHM is unknown and may not relate to Nahom at all. *It has been suggested that Joseph Smith simply created the name Nahom as a variant of the Biblical names Naham (1 Chron. 4:19), Nehum (Ne. 7:7) and Nahum (Na. 1:1), although this fails to account for the plausible placement of the actual location of NHM relative to the description of Lehi's journey in the Book of Mormon narrative. It has been said that the link between Nahom and Nehhm, as spelled in Niebuhr's work, is invalid because the vowels between the names Nahom and Nehhm do not match, stating that \\"only three of the five letters in Nehhm agree with the spelling Nahom. The second letter in Nehhm is e rather than a, and the fourth letter is h instead of o. The variant spellings of Nehem, Nehm, Nihm, Nahm and Naham, do not really help to solve the problem.\\" Some indicate that modern vowel variance is to be expected because Hebrew does not have written vowels.name=\\"Introduction to Hebrew Vowels\\" The current pronunciation of the location and tribal area is said to be Nihm or Nehem or Nahm rather than Nahom. One critic states that the time from Ishmael's death to now (~2600 years) is not long enough to account for the change in pronunciation, although scholars indicate that historical variation in root pronunciation (possibly due to Arabic influence) may allow for this change.\\"The exact equivalency of the root letters cannot be assured. It is probable that the term Nahom was spelled with the rasped or fricative Hebrew letter for 'h' (het or chet) whereas the name Nihm, both in modern Arabic and in the ancient Sabaean dialect, is spelled with a softer, less audible h sound.\\" See G. Lankester Harding, An Index and Concordance of Pre- Islamic Arabian Names and Inscriptions (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1971), 81, 602. Dating of NHM LDS apologists argue that the NHM does indeed date to Lehi's time. The inscriptions on \\"small votive altars given to the Bar'an Temple near Marib by a certain Bicathar of the tribe of Nihm\\" date to \\"seventh and sixth centuries BC\\".http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1082&index;=5 Lehi's family is believed to have left Jerusalem in the sixth century.

She left school at thirteen, and worked in a range of unskilled jobs before gaining her Intermediate Certificate at TAFE. She moved to Lismore at the age of 24, and began working as the co-ordinator of a women's refuge. She also established a domestic violence liaison committee with the local police, which was the first of its kind outside Sydney. She later gained a teaching qualification at the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education, and taught for a period before deciding to retrain as a lawyer and gaining a degree by correspondence from Macquarie University. Political career She ran as the Labor candidate for the seat of Lismore at the 1991 state election, but was defeated by incumbent National Party MP Bill Rixon. Four years later, she contested and won preselection for the eighth and last winnable position on the Labor ticket for the Legislative Council at the 1995 state election. Labor's victory at the election thus saw her comfortably elected, albeit on preferences, on election day. Saffin was associated with the Socialist Left faction of the party throughout her term, and was involved in advocating for progressive causes both inside and outside of parliament. She took a particular interest in the fate of East Timor and Burma, and was an official observer for the International Commission of Jurists at the 1999 independence referendum in East Timor. She was actively involved in feminist causes, and was one of only two Australian representatives at the Global Forum of Women Political Leaders in Manila in 2000. She also worked as an anti-nuclear campaigner, being involved in the campaigns against French nuclear testing in the Pacific and uranium mining at Jabiluka. She attempted to gain Labor preselection for a second term before the 2003 state election, but missed out on one of her faction's three winnable positions, forcing her out of politics. Saffin had met East Timorese foreign minister José Ramos-Horta a number of times as an MP, and in 2004, having left politics, she moved to East Timor to take up a position as Ramos-Horta's chief political and legal advisor. She served in the role for three years assisting in the rebuilding of the country, staying with Ramos-Horta through his election first to Prime Minister and then President in 2007. She resigned in early 2007, choosing to return to Australia for \\"family reasons\\" and contest preselection for the National Party held federal seat of Page, based around her home town of Lismore. She faced a difficult preselection contest against right faction candidate and local mayor Ian Tiley, but emerged successful. Saffin then faced a difficult contest in the general election against new National Party candidate Chris Gulaptis, with previous member Ian Causley having decided to retire at the election. Causley had held the seat with a 5.5% margin, which saw the possibility of victory initially considered unlikely. However, as Labor continued to poll well in the seat, they began to supply more resources to the campaign, with the party's assistant secretary declaring Page to be a \\"target seat\\" in September. She campaigned heavily on industrial relations, health and housing affordability, and received a 2PP swing of 7.8%, beating the Nationals candidate on Greens preferences. This resulted in Page being one of the first seats nationally to be declared on election night. On 21 March 2013 she resigned as Government Whip after an attempt to replace Prime Minister Julia Gillard with the previous Prime Minister Kevin Rudd failed. The attempt foundered when Rudd unexpectedly announced that he would not contest the position. Saffin had indicated support for Rudd. Saffin was defeated at the 2013 election against Nationals candidate Kevin Hogan. She defeated him at the 2010 election, improving her vote. However she then suffered a 7.2% swing against her in 2013. At a TAFE rally on 23 September 2015, with Labor's Shadow Minister for Vocational Education, Sharon Bird, Janelle Saffin announced that she would again contest the federal seat of Page at the 2016 election. She was subsequently defeated by Kevin Hogan. On 22 April 2018 Saffin won preselection to contest the NSW State seat of Lismore, which she won on 23 March 2019.

Following secret promises made by the Allies in the 1915 Treaty of London, Italy entered the war aiming to annex the Austrian Littoral, northern Dalmatia, and the territories of present-day Trentino and South Tyrol. Although Italy had hoped to gain the territories with a surprise offensive, the front soon bogged down into trench warfare, similar to that on the Western Front in France, but at high altitudes and with very cold winters. Fighting along the front displaced much of the local population, and several thousand civilians died from malnutrition and illness in Italian and Austrian refugee-camps.Petra Svoljšak (1991). Slovene refugees in Italy during the First World War (Slovenski begunci v Italiji med prvo svetovno vojno), Ljubljana. Diego Leoni – Camillo Zadra (1995), La città di legno: profughi trentini in Austria 1915–1918, Trento-Rovereto 1995. The Allied victory at Vittorio Veneto in November 1918, the disintegration of Austria-Hungary and the Italian capture of Trento, Bolzano and Trieste ended the military operations. Italy also refers to the Great War as the \\"Fourth War of Independence\\", which completed the last stage of Italian unification. Finally on November 3, 1918, the Austro-Hungarian high command asked armistice in the name of an Empire which (de facto and de jure) no longer existed during the negotiations. History =Pre-war period= A pro-war demonstration in Bologna, 1914. While being a member of the Triple Alliance which consisted of Italy, Austria-Hungary and Germany, Italy did not declare war in August 1914, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature and therefore Austria-Hungary's aggression did not obligate Italy to take part. Moreover, Austria-Hungary omitted to consult Italy before sending the ultimatum to Serbia and refused to discuss compensation due according to article 7 of the Alliance. Italy had a longstanding rivalry with Austria- Hungary, dating back to the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, which granted several regions on the Italian peninsula to the Austrian Empire. More importantly, a radical nationalist political movement, called Unredeemed Italy (Italia irredenta), founded in the 1880s, started claiming the Italian-inhabited territories of Austria-Hungary, especially in the Austrian Littoral and in the County of Tyrol. By the 1910s, the expansionist ideas of this movement were taken up by a significant part of the Italian political elite. The annexation of those Austrian territories that were inhabited by Italians became the main Italian war goal, assuming a similar function to the issue of Alsace-Lorraine for the French. However, of around 1.5 million people living in those areas, 45% were Italian speakers, while the rest were Slovenes, Germans and Croats. In northern Dalmatia, which was also among the Italian war aims, the Italian-speaking population was only around 5%. In the early stages of the war, Allied diplomats secretly courted Italy, attempting to secure Italian participation on the Allied side. Set up between the British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey, the Italian Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino and the French Foreign Minister Jules Cambon, Italy's entry was finally engineered by the Treaty of London of 26 April 1915, in which Italy renounced her obligations to the Triple Alliance. On 23 May, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. =Campaigns of 1915–1916= Italian soldiers listening to their General's speech During the Italo-Turkish War in Libya (1911–1912), the Italian military suffered equipment and munition shortages not yet repaired before Italian entry into the Great War. At the opening of the campaign, Austro-Hungarian troops occupied and fortified high ground of the Julian Alps and Karst Plateau, but the Italians initially outnumbered their opponents three-to-one. Battles of Isonzo in 1915 L/45 M. 16 naval guns An Italian offensive aimed to cross the Soča (Isonzo) river, take the fortress town of Gorizia, and then enter the Karst Plateau. This offensive opened the first Battles of the Isonzo. At the beginning of the First Battle of the Isonzo on 23 June 1915, Italian forces outnumbered the Austrians three- to-one but failed to penetrate the strong Austro-Hungarian defensive lines in the highlands of northwestern Gorizia and Gradisca. Because the Austrian forces occupied higher ground, Italians conducted difficult offensives while climbing. The Italian forces therefore failed to drive much beyond the river, and the battle ended on 7 July 1915. Despite a professional officer corps, severely under-equipped Italian units lacked morale. Also many troops deeply disliked the newly appointed Italian commander, general Luigi Cadorna. Moreover, preexisting equipment and munition shortages slowed progress and frustrated all expectations for a \\"Napoleonic style\\" breakout. Like most contemporaneous militaries, the Italian army primarily used horses for transport but struggled and sometimes failed to supply the troops sufficiently in the tough terrain. Two weeks later on 18 July 1915, the Italians attempted another frontal assault against the Austro-Hungarian trench lines with more artillery in Second Battle of the Isonzo. In the northern section of the front, the Italians managed to overrun Mount Batognica over Kobarid (Caporetto), which would have an important strategic value in future battles. This bloody offensive concluded in stalemate when both sides ran out of ammunition. The Italians recuperated, rearmed with 1200 heavy guns, and then on 18 October 1915 launched Third Battle of the Isonzo, another attack. Forces of Austria-Hungary repulsed this Italian offensive, which concluded on 4 November without resulting gains. The Italians again launched another offensive on 10 November, the Fourth Battle of the Isonzo. Both sides suffered more casualties, but the Italians conquered important entrenchments, and the battle ended on 2 December for exhaustion of armaments, but occasional skirmishing persisted. After the winter lull, the Italians launched the Fifth Battle of the Isonzo on 9 March 1916, and captured the strategic Mount Sabatino. But Austria-Hungary repulsed all other attacks, and the battle concluded on 16 March in poor weather for trench warfare. The Asiago offensive Following Italy's stalemate, the Austrian forces began planning a counteroffensive (Battle of Asiago) in Trentino and directed over the plateau of Altopiano di Asiago, with the aim to break through to the Po River plain and thus cutting off the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Italian Armies in the North East of the country. The offensive began on 15 May 1916 with 15 divisions, and resulted in initial gains, but then the Italians counterattacked and pushed the Austro-Hungarians back to the Tyrol. Later battles for the Isonzo The Austro-Hungarian supply line over the Vršič pass, October 1917 Later in 1916, four more battles along the Isonzo river erupted. The Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, launched by the Italians in August, resulted in a success greater than the previous attacks. The offensive gained nothing of strategic value but did take Gorizia, which boosted Italian spirits. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth battles of the Isonzo (14 September – 4 November) managed to accomplish little except to wear down the already exhausted armies of both nations. The frequency of offensives for which the Italian soldiers partook between May 1915 and August 1917, one every three months, was higher than demanded by the armies on the Western Front. Italian discipline was also harsher, with punishments for infractions of duty of a severity not known in the German, French, and British armies. Shellfire in the rocky terrain caused 70% more casualties per rounds expended than on the soft ground in Belgium and France. By the autumn of 1917 the Italian army had suffered most of the deaths it was to incur during the war, yet the end of the war seemed to still be an eternity away. This was not the same line of thought for the Austrians. On 25 August, the Emperor Charles wrote to the Kaiser the following: \\"The experience we have acquired in the eleventh battle has led me to believe that we should fare far worse in the twelfth. My commanders and brave troops have decided that such an unfortunate situation might be anticipated by an offensive. We have not the necessary means as regards troops.\\" =Tunnel warfare in the mountains= A mine gallery in the ice at Pasubio Trenches at the mount Škabrijel in 1917 From 1915, the high peaks of the Dolomites range were an area of fierce mountain warfare. In order to protect their soldiers from enemy fire and the hostile alpine environment, both Austro-Hungarian and Italian military engineers constructed fighting tunnels which offered a degree of cover and allowed better logistics support. Working at high altitudes in the hard carbonate rock of the Dolomites, often in exposed areas near mountain peaks and even in glacial ice, required extreme skill of both Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners. Beginning on the 13th, later referred to as White Friday, December 1916 would see 10,000 soldiers on both sides killed by avalanches in the Dolomites. Numerous avalanches were caused by the Italians and Austro- Hungarians purposefully firing artillery shells on the mountainside, while others were naturally caused. In addition to building underground shelters and covered supply routes for their soldiers like the Italian Strada delle 52 Gallerie, both sides also attempted to break the stalemate of trench warfare by tunneling under no man's land and placing explosive charges beneath the enemy's positions. Between 1 January 1916 and 13 March 1918, Austro-Hungarian and Italian units fired a total of 34 mines in this theatre of the war. Focal points of the underground fighting were Pasubio with 10 mines, Lagazuoi with 5, Col di Lana/Monte Sief also with 5, and Marmolada with 4 mines. The explosive charges ranged from to of blasting gelatin. In April 1916, the Italians detonated explosives under the peaks of Col Di Lana, killing numerous Austro-Hungarians. =1917: Germany arrives on the front= The Battle of Caporetto The Italians directed a two-pronged attack against the Austrian lines north and east of Gorizia. The Austrians checked the advance east, but Italian forces under Luigi Capello managed to break the Austrian lines and capture the Banjšice Plateau. Characteristic of nearly every other theater of the war, the Italians found themselves on the verge of victory but could not secure it because their supply lines could not keep up with the front-line troops and they were forced to withdraw. However, the Italians despite suffering heavy casualties had almost exhausted and defeated the Austro- Hungarian army on the front, forcing them to call in German help for the much anticipated Caporetto Offensive. The Austrians received desperately needed reinforcements after the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo from German Army soldiers rushed in after the Russian offensive ordered by Kerensky of July 1917 failed. The Germans introduced infiltration tactics to the Austrian front and helped work on a new offensive. Meanwhile, mutinies and plummeting morale crippled the Italian Army from within. The soldiers lived in poor conditions and engaged in attack after attack that often yielded minimal or no military gain. On 24 October 1917 the Austrians and Germans launched the Battle of Caporetto (Italian name for Kobarid). Chlorine-arsenic agent and diphosgene gas shells were fired as part of a huge artillery barrage, followed by infantry using infiltration tactics, bypassing enemy strong points and attacking on the Italian rear. At the end of the first day, the Italians had retreated to the Tagliamento River. When the Austrian offensive routed the Italians, the new Italian chief of staff, Armando Diaz ordered to stop their retreat and defend the fortified defenses around the Monte Grappa summit between the Roncone and the Tomatico mountains; although numerically inferior (51,000 against 120,000) the Italian Army managed to halt the Austro-Hungarian and German armies in the First Battle of Monte Grappa. =1918: The war ends= Second Battle of the Piave River (June 1918) Austro-Hungarian trench in Ortler Alps, 1917 Advancing deep and fast, the Austrians outran their supply lines, which forced them to stop and regroup. The Italians, pushed back to defensive lines near Venice on the Piave River, had suffered 600,000 casualties to this point in the war. Because of these losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so-called 99 Boys (Ragazzi del '99); the new class of conscripts born in 1899 who were turning 18 in 1917. In November 1917, British and French troops started to bolster the front line, from the 5 and 6 divisions respectively provided. Far more decisive to the war effort than their troops was the Allies economic assistance by providing strategic materials (steel, coal and crops – provided by the British but imported from Argentina – etc.), which Italy always lacked sorely. In the spring of 1918, Germany pulled out its troops for use in its upcoming Spring Offensive on the Western Front. As a result of the Spring Offensive, Britain and France also pulled half of their divisions back to the Western Front. The Austrians now began debating how to finish the war in Italy. The Austro-Hungarian generals disagreed on how to administer the final offensive. Archduke Joseph August of Austria decided for a two-pronged offensive, where it would prove impossible for the two forces to communicate in the mountains. The Second Battle of the Piave River began with a diversionary attack near the Tonale Pass named Lawine, which the Italians repulsed after two days of fighting. Austrian deserters betrayed the objectives of the upcoming offensive, which allowed the Italians to move two armies directly in the path of the Austrian prongs. The other prong, led by general Svetozar Boroević von Bojna initially experienced success until aircraft bombed their supply lines and Italian reinforcements arrived. The Italian front in 1918 and the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. Italian troops landing in Trieste, 3 November 1918 The decisive Battle of Vittorio Veneto (October–November 1918) To the disappointment of Italy's allies, no counter-offensive followed the Battle of Piave. The Italian Army had suffered huge losses in the battle, and considered an offensive dangerous. General Armando Diaz waited for more reinforcements to arrive from the Western Front. By the end of October 1918, Austro-Hungary was falling apart. Czechoslovakia, Croatia, and Slovenia proclaimed their independence and troops started deserting, disobeying orders and retreating. Many Czechoslovak troops, in fact, started working for the Allied Cause, and in September 1918, five Czechoslovak Regiments were formed in the Italian Army. By October 1918, Italy finally had enough soldiers to mount an offensive. The attack targeted Vittorio Veneto, across the Piave. The Italian Army broke through a gap near Sacile and poured in reinforcements that crushed the Austrian defensive line. On 31 October, the whole front began to collapse and the Italian Army launched a full scale attack. On 3 November, 300,000 Austrian soldiers surrendered, at the same day the Italians entered Trento and Trieste, greeted by the population. On 3 November, the military leaders of the already disintegrated Austria-Hungary sent a flag of truce to the Italian commander to ask again for an armistice and terms of peace. The terms were arranged by telegraph with the Allied authorities in Paris, communicated to the Austrian commander, and were accepted. The Armistice with Austria was signed in the Villa Giusti, near Padua, on 3 November, and took effect at three o'clock in the afternoon of 4 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the Habsburg Monarchy and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. =Casualties= Italian military deaths numbered 834 senior officers and generals, 16,872 junior officers, 16,302 non-commissioned officers, and 497,103 enlisted men, for a total of over 531,000 dead. Of these, 257,418 men came from Northern Italy, 117,480 from Central Italy, and 156,251 from Southern Italy.Ministry of War and later Ministry of Defence: Albo d’Oro [Roll of Honour], 28 vols., Rome 1926–1964. =Occupation of northern Dalmatia and Tyrol= By the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact.Paul O'Brien.

His inventions include the \\"Kwikurent\\" device for the rapid charging of a car battery, and a machine to balance car wheels while they spin. He founded Hunter Engineering Company in 1946. For his \\"dramatic impact on the development of the automobile and the automotive industry\\" he was inducted posthumously into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan, US. Kwikurent Lee Hunter, Jr., was a 23-year-old St. Louis architecture student, found himself frequently confronted with car battery failure in his Packard convertible automobile. In 1936, it took several days to recharge a car battery. Hunter sought to find a better, faster way to recharge batteries. With the help of a former Washington University electrical engineering professor, Hunter began developing a new design. His quick charge battery recharger was based on a diverter pole generator. He put this new product on the market and during the Great Depression, the Lee Hunter, Jr., Manufacturing Co. sold the $497 Kwikurent charger as fast as the company could make them. Hunter Engineering After serving in both the United States Army Corps of Engineers and Ordnance Corps during World War II, Hunter returned to St. Louis in 1946 and reopened his business under the name of Hunter Engineering. Lee Hunter also laid the foundation for a global distribution base for Hunter products. In 1955 Hunter developed a new wheel alignment system called 'Lite- A-Line', which became the industry standard. In 1962, Hunter's 'Tune-Align' became the first mechanical alignment system capable of compensating for wheel run-out, a major factor affecting wheel alignment precision. Hunter Engineering continued to expand its export markets and in 1964 was named by the U.S. Department of Commerce as a winner of the E-Award for excellence in the development of export trade. Automotive Hall of Fame Nearly 50 years after Lee Hunter founded Hunter Engineering Company, he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan. In this shrine of automotive history, Lee Hunter shares the spotlight with automotive industry giants like Henry Ford, Louis Chevrolet, Walter P. Chrysler and Soichiro Honda. The Hall of Fame places Hunter among “individuals who have made a dramatic impact on the development of the automobile and the automotive industry”. He is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

The term how derives from the Old Norse word haugr meaning a hill and a mound, so Greenhow literally means 'Green's hill or mound'. History It is situated about west of Pateley Bridge on the road heading towards Grassington, and is mainly in the civil parish of Bewerley. However, the western end of the village lying to the west of Kell Dyke, commonly known as Craven Cross, lies within the civil parish of Appletreewick in Craven. It is one of the highest villages in Yorkshire, at an altitude of between , and one of the few villages in the United Kingdom lying at over . Greenhow is an old mining village that was a major supplier of lead. Sir Stephen Proctor bought the Manor of Bewerley, including the mineral rights in 1597. He was also responsible, as part of a settlement with John Armitage over disputed land, for the founding of the actual village of Greenhow. Prior to this date the only settlement recorded on the Hill itself was Kell House, where monks of Fountains Abbey lived while guarding the abbey's lead interests. In 1613, an agreement sought to protect the Greenhow miners' rights: \\"…there may be cottages erected for the miners and mineral workmen upon the said waste … and also for the keeping of draught oxen and horses for the maintenance of the mines, always leaving the tenants sufficient common\\". Joseph Kipling, the grandfather of Rudyard Kipling was the minister at the Methodist Chapel at Greenhow and Rudyard himself is known to have visited the village. There is a 'Kiplings Cottage' next door to the 'Miners Arms', but it is not known whether his grandfather actually lived there. The church in the village (St Mary's) is reputedly the highest parish church in England still in use, though services are now only fortnightly on Sunday evenings plus major feast times. Coldstones Quarry To the east of the village is Coldstones Quarry, operated by Hanson. The quarry is unusual in that it is located on high ground and is not easy to observe from above like most other quarries in the Yorkshire Dales. The quarry produces of limestone aggregate per year, with most being used in West and North Yorkshire. Small amounts of fluorspar are also won from the limestone which is sent to Derbyshire for processing. A large public artwork, The Coldstones Cut, has been created by the artist Andrew Sabin, and was opened in 2010. Greenhow Hill The name Greenhow Hill is also applied to a section of the B6265 road which runs between Pateley Bridge and Grassington through the village of Greenhow. The road has a very steep descent into Pateley Bridge from Greenhow (between 16 and 19%) and has been the setting for many accidents, especially for people on bicycles. This stretch of road is very popular with cyclists; it was part of the 2016 Tour de Yorkshire and is part of the Way of the Roses bike trail. Greenhow Hill (), is also the summit point between Nidderdale to the east and Wharfedale to the west.

It is part of the Town of Kittery, in York County. History Appledore Island was originally settled by Europeans in the colonial era, when the ease of transport by water made farming on island economically efficient. A church was established in 1640. Near 1700, the entire settlement on this island moved to Star Island in New Hampshire to escape taxes imposed by Massachusetts (of which Maine was then a province). The heyday of the island was the artists salon that thrived there in the late 19th century, before the advent of artists' colonies as we know them today. Celia Thaxter reigned over an impressive group of friends who were also the leading artists, musicians, and writers of the day. These included Edward MacDowell and his wife; American pianist William Mason, son of Lowell Mason, who played the grand piano in her salon daily; and John Knowles Paine, America's first serious composer of note. Childe Hassam painted Celia's magnificent garden in a style similar to Monet's Giverny paintings. This rarefied atmosphere ended with Thaxter's death in 1894. The hotel burned in 1914, bringing down the final curtain on this heyday in American arts. A charming small original daybook from this time period was re-published in part, in 1992, titled The Isles of Shoals Remembered, by Caleb Mason, author page here: http://www.dontrowden.com/ Today, the island is home to Shoals Marine Laboratory, run cooperatively by Cornell University and the University of New Hampshire since the early 1970s.Robinson, J. Dennis, Around Appledore Island (describing island, including copious photos). Appledore Island is owned predominantly by the Star Island Corporation. The most prominent feature on the island is a World War II concrete observation tower built to hold a radar installation. The dome intended to hold the radar no longer exists, and the radar unit was never installed.  Geology  The maximum elevation of Appledore is about 80 feet above sea level. The majority of the island has a metamorphic makeup, with gneiss being the most prevalent. The formation of the island is thought to be characterized by 5 major geological events, namely formation of the Rye Complex of Maine and New Hampshire, intrusion of diorites, Acadian orogeny, diabase dikes, and glaciation. Evidence of these events can be seen in glacial scarps, evidence of abrasion, presence of dikes, glacial plucking, and more. For example, glacial plucking contributed to the whaleback shape of the island which is resultant of rock drumlin cliff faces.

Nicknamed \\"Monty\\", he played his entire career in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the Boston Red Sox from 1970 to 1979. He batted and threw right- handed and also played six games at first base. But he occasionally jokes that he is \\"amphibious\\", meaning he is ambidextrous, as he writes left-handed. Montgomery signed for the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1962 and played for seven of their minor league affiliates until 1970, when the Red Sox promoted him to the major leagues. There, he served as the team's backup catcher behind future Hall of Fame member Carlton Fisk. He spent the next nine years with the Red Sox and played his last game on September 9, 1979. Montgomery is most famous for being the last major league player to bat without wearing a batting helmet. Personal life Montgomery was born on April 16, 1944, in Nashville, Tennessee. Baseball played a huge role in his family; his father frequently took part in sandlot ball, while his brother Gerald played for several minor league affiliates of the Boston Red Sox. Montgomery attended Nashville's Central High School. Although he actively participated in three sports, he was most inclined to baseball, playing in the outfield, at first base and pitching. Upon his graduation from high school. Montgomery was signed by George J. Digby, a renowned scout who worked for the Boston Red Sox organization. Professional career =Minor leagues= Montgomery began his professional baseball career for the Olean Red Sox, a minor league baseball team that were members of the New York–Penn League. Playing both third base and the outfield, he batted .273, enough to earn him a promotion to the Class-A Waterloo Hawks of the Midwest League in the following season. It was here that Montgomery was encouraged by manager Len Okrie to switch positions to catcher, in order to improve his chances of being promoted into the major leagues. =Boston Red Sox (1970–1979)= In , Major League Baseball made it compulsory for all players to wear batting helmets, although active players like Montgomery were allowed to continue batting without one per a grandfather clause. Montgomery opted to utilize this privilege, choosing to strengthen the inside of his cap with protective lining instead. Consequently, Montgomery was the last major league player to bat without wearing a batting helmet when he played his final game on September 9, 1979. In 387 career games, he compiled a .258 batting average with 23 home runs and 156 runs batted in. Post-playing career After his playing career, Montgomery spent fourteen seasons (1982 through 1995) as the color commentator for Red Sox telecasts on WSBK-TV. Montgomery now owns and operates Big League Promotions which manufactures game boards using professional sports licensing. He has also served as a color analyst for telecasts of the minor-league Pawtucket Red Sox and Portland Sea Dogs on NESN and Cox Sports.

Family Bentinck was born into the prominent Bentinck family, the fifth child and third son of William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland and Henrietta (née Scott). His mother was the daughter, and along with her two sisters, the heiress, of the rich General John Scott of Fife. Bentinck was known by the name George, as at the time all the men in his family were given the first name William. He was educated privately and grew up on his father's Welbeck Abbey estate in Nottinghamshire and at Fullarton House, near Troon, Ayrshire, where his father was developing the docks. Early career Statue in Cavendish Square, London In 1818, Bentinck and his older brother John joined the army, but personal conflicts derailed his military career. As an officer in the 9th Lancers, he called his superior officer, Captain John Ker, a \\"poltroon\\", in February 1821. Ker levelled charges against Bentinck of \\"inattention to duty and contemptuous, insubordinate and disrespectful behaviour.\\" Bentinck requested an inquiry into the charges and was ultimately cleared. However, the incident would not die and in May 1821, in Paris, Bentinck and Ker were prepared to duel. Bentinck's uncle George Canning, interceded and stopped the event. Bentinck returned to England and exchanged regiments, with the plan of going to India. In May 1822, he was assigned as aide-de-camp to Canning, who had accepted the position of Governor-General of India. Instead, Canning became foreign secretary after The Marquess of Londonderry committed suicide. Canning requested both George and John be his non-stipendiary private secretaries \\"to wean them from their too great zeal in the chase and too great idleness in every other respect.\\" John declined, joining the Life Guard Regiment, but George accepted the position. In 1824, the death of their eldest brother, Henry, the Marquess of Titchfield, caused another change of plans. John became the Marquess of Titchfield and George took his place in the Life Guards, \\"it being the duke of Portland's wish that he should now take to the army as his profession.\\" Once again conflicts arose; in July 1825, Bentinck engaged a junior officer in a bloodless duel over an incident related to the mess accounts. Bentinck then left the regiment and took half-pay with the rank of major. In 1828, he ran unopposed as the Whig representative for King's Lynn before moving over to join the Conservative Party (via the Derby Dilly parliamentary faction) by about 1835–6. Bentinck held King's Lynn until his death. Horse racing Before his interest in active politics in the 1840s, Bentinck was far better known for his interest in \\"the Turf.\\" He was a notorious gambler, often losing substantial amounts. Bentinck owned several successful racehorses and his stable, which he established at Goodwood, was renowned for its quality. During the 1845 season, it was estimated that he had won more than £100,000.Macintyre (n.d.) Bentinck made strenuous efforts to eliminate fraud in the sport (although his own behaviour in fixing odds was not always scrupulous). In 1844, having exposed the winner of the Derby as a fraud, he proposed a set of rules to cover horse racing. By a series of legal actions he also limited the corruption involved in making and settlement of bets, deriving from outdated legislation. He is also credited with inventing the flag start at a race meeting at Goodwood. Prior to that races had been started by the starter shouting. Although something of a \\"self-appointed vigilante\\", he is now seen as a great innovator and reformer of the sport. Though he was an \\"aristocratic dandy\\" who wore a new silk scarf every day, Bentinck's volatile temper again got him in trouble. He nearly lost his life in a duel over an unpaid debt. He fired his pistol in the air as his opponent, Squire Osbaldeston, an expert marksman, was flustered and missed, shooting Bentinck cleanly through the hat. Despite his success in horse racing, his father reportedly strongly disapproved of this activity, and the duke was delighted when his son returned to \\"the more elevated occupations of political society.\\" To commit himself to his political career, in 1846, Bentinck sold his entire stables and racing team for the bargain price of £10,000.MacIintyre (n.d.) Leader of the Protectionists Bentinck first became prominent in politics in 1846 when he, with Disraeli, led the protectionist opposition to the repeal of the Corn Laws. Until he rose to speak against their repeal, he had not spoken a word in 18 years in Parliament. Historians see Bentinck's participation as vital, for the majority of those who opposed repeal were country gentlemen, who were far more likely to follow the son of a Duke than Disraeli, an Anglicized Sephardic-Jewish literary figure, then of dubious repute. The Bentinck-Disraeli relationship culminated in Bentinck offering to provide a £25,000 loan for Disraeli's purchase of Hughenden Manor in 1848.Blake (1998 paperback) pp251-3 Although Bentinck and Disraeli did not prevent the repeal of the Corn Laws, they did succeed in forcing Peel's resignation some weeks later over the Irish Coercion Bill.Blake (1998 paperback) pp241-2 The Conservative Party broke in half; some hundred free- trade Peelites followed Peel, while 230 protectionists formed the new Conservative Party, with Stanley (later the Earl of Derby) as overall leader. Bentinck became leader of the party in the House of Commons.Blake (1998 paperback) p248 He unsuccessfully led calls upon the government of Lord John Russell to alleviate suffering in Ireland arising from the Great Famine of Ireland by investing in a substantial railway construction programme. Bentinck resigned the leadership in 1848, his support of Jewish emancipation being unpopular with the bulk of the party, and was succeeded by the Marquess of Granby.Blake (1998 paperback) pp261-2 Death and legacy Memorial to Bentinck on the path where he died, near Worksop On 21 September 1848, Bentinck left his father's home at Welbeck Abbey at 3 pm, intending to walk through \\"The Dukeries\\" to Thoresby Hall to dine with Charles Pierrepont, 2nd Earl Manvers. A search party was sent to look for him when he did not arrive at Thoresby, and his body was ultimately found at 9 p.m. He was aged 46. Initial reports stated it appeared he died of \\"apoplexy,\\" but it is believed he died of a heart attack. Although there were rumours of suicide (or even murder), his autopsy clearly showed emphysema and congestion of the lungs.MacIntyre (n.d.) Bentinck, who was unmarried (there were rumours that he and his brother Lord Henry were, in the phraseology of the time, \\"woman haters\\"),\\"Sporting Notes\\", Sporting Times, 14 December 1907 was buried in the Duke of Portland vault at Marylebone Old Church in London. He is commemorated with a statue in London's Cavendish Square Gardens, a memorial close to the spot where he died near Worksop, and a large gothic memorial by Thomas Chambers Hine erected in Mansfield. Charles Greville (who had once been a partner of Bentinck in a horse-racing syndicate) wrote of him after his death: \\"He brought into politics the same ardour, activity, industry and cleverness which he had displayed on the turf . . . having once espoused a cause and espoused a party, from whatever motive, he worked with all the force of his intellect and a superhuman power of application in what he perceived to be the interest of that party and that cause . . . [However] I have not the least doubt that, for his own reputation and celebrity, he died at the most opportune period; his fame had probably reached its zenith, and credit was given him for greater abilities than he possessed.\\" The Department of Manuscripts and Special Collections at the University of Nottingham holds the correspondence and personal papers of Lord George Bentinck, as part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection.

It was released by SuperEgo Records on May 3, 2005. It is a concept album, telling the story of two characters who run off with each other to escape their problems, but end up in more trouble than either of them could have imagined. The album reflects Mann's own boxing in its story and illustrations. The title is derived from a move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to \\"forget\\" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album won the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for Mann and Gail Marowitz (art directors). Reception The album so far has a score of 70 out of 100 from Metacritic based on \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Prefix Magazine gave the album a score of seven out of ten and said it has \\"Enough bending guitar licks to satisfy the yuppiest of thirtysomething businessmen and enough mellow ballads to satisfy your Dixie Chicks-loving mom.\\"Prefix Magazine review Trouser Press gave it a positive review and said, \\"Some of the songs are immediately engrossing... Others mostly carry the story forward while allowing Mann to indulge her career-long taste for vintage keyboard orchestration, coolly elegant pop arrangements and displays of tart wordplay.\\"Trouser Press review E! Online gave it a B− and said it \\"reveals how straight-up dull Mann's country-tinged songs can be.\\" Other reviews are very average, mixed or negative: Mojo gave it three stars out of five and called it \\"an unfussy affair\\". Blender gave it two stars out of five and said of Mann, \\"If she doesn't follow commercial formulas, she's following creative ones, and selling herself short in the process.\\" The A.V.

They get the idea that they can escape their problems by running off together and travelling across the United States. However, their relationship begins to fray as John's addiction to alcohol comes to light. In Vegas, John leaves Caroline to try to get help (\\"Goodbye Caroline\\") but resists treatment (\\"I Can't Get My Head Around It\\") and finally Caroline gives up on trying to help John (\\"I Can't Help You Anymore\\"). However, the album's final song indicates that everything works out somehow, although much later. \\"It's a character study and a relationship study,\\" Mann says Bonus track The Japanese edition of The Forgotten Arm contains a bonus track (\\"Who Knows\\"). This minute-long track acts as an epilogue to the story of Caroline & John, with the following lyrics: :He's always pulled through before, but that's no comfort now. :Who knows in a Holy War, what's winning anyhow? :Who knows? :Who knows? :Who knows? :Who knows? :You only hope that someone shows, who knows.

Richmond was founded in 1972, by British educator Cyril Taylor. The university maintains two campuses in Greater London, in Richmond Hill and Kensington. The university awards US degrees from the American state of Delaware, where Richmond is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Until 2018, Richmond's UK degrees were awarded by the Open University; but from the 2018/2019 academic year, Richmond has been able to grant its own UK degrees, after receiving Taught Degree Awarding Powers from the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.ECE Connection - UK degree-awarding powers granted to Richmond, The American International University in London (United Kingdom) This mean that all students at Richmond gain both a UK and US degree studying one programme. History Richmond was founded in 1972 by the social entrepreneur and politician Cyril Taylor, chairman of the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS), as Richmond College, The American College in London. It began teaching on the site of the former Richmond Theological College, part of the University of London, founded in 1843 as a Methodist theological college. AIFS had been previously using the college site for a number of years for their London study abroad programmes. AIFS purchased half of the college's 10 acre site for £300,000 (equivalent to £3.82 million in 2015), including the majority of its buildings and front lawns, to form a new American liberal arts college.Cyril Taylor. 2013. Sir Cyril: My Life as a Social Entrepreneur. Stroud: Amberley. A second campus was opened on St Albans Grove and Ansdell Street in Kensington in 1978 for third and fourth year students as well as the college's US Study Abroad Programme. In its early years Richmond served mainly to house study abroad programmes to US students, however this changed in 1981 when Richmond obtained a licence to award US undergraduate degrees from the Washington DC Board of Education and formal accreditation from the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges (now the Middle States Commission on Higher Education). With this it became a fully accredited independent liberal arts university. Following the closure of the Washington DC Board of Education, Richmond gained a licence to award degrees in Delaware, which continues to be used for its US degrees. An expansion of the university's Kensington campus on Young Street was officially opened in March 1988 by Diana, Princess of Wales. In 1995 AIFS spun-off the university as a non-profit educational institution. Richmond inaugurated its first postgraduate degree in 1998 with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. From 1996 to 2018 Richmond issued British degrees validated by the Open University. In May 2018, the University was granted Taught Degree Awarding Powers in the UK, enabling students to receive two degree certificates, from the US and UK. In December 2019 the university president, Lawrence Abeln, resigned after filing a complaint with the Charity Commission against the Cyril Taylor Charitable Foundation, the main financial backers of the university. In January 2020 financial problems caused by the dispute with the foundation led the board of trustees to suspend recruitment of students for the spring term. In March 2020 the university signed an agreement with the Hong Kong based China Education Group (CEG), giving Richmond students access to internships and exchange programs across CEG's universities and institutes in China and Australia as well as expanding Richmond's international marketing and recruitment. The partners said the deal would \\"secure the long-term future of the university\\". Organization =Governance= The board of trustees is responsible for the stewardship of the university's assets, strategic decision-making and ensuring compliance with its objectives. The board is chaired by Roger King, a former vice- chancellor of the University of Lincoln. The current president of Richmond, since December 2019, is Phil Deans. Richmond had an average of 163 staff, including 83 academic staff, 68 management and administrative staff and 12 technical staff, during the year ending 30 June 2017. In the financial year ending 30 June 2017, Richmond (including the UK charity the Richmond Foundation, which is controlled by the university) had a total income of £35.7 million (including a one-off donation of £10 million from Cyril Taylor) and total expenditure of £25.2 million  Academics  =Constituent schools= Richmond, The American International University in London is composed of three constituent schools: *Richmond Business School *Richmond School of Communications, Arts & Social Sciences (CASS) *Richmond School of Liberal Arts =Curriculum= Richmond offers a range of majors and minors at undergraduate level in business, economics, political science, international relations, media, the arts and humanities. Standard degrees are four-years long though may be completed earlier through transfer credits from US Advanced Placement classes, UK A and AS Levels, the International Baccalaureate and other similar qualifications. All undergraduate programmes at Richmond follow a broad, US liberal arts approach to education, combined with the British system of specialisation. In addition it offers a range of postgraduate degrees including Master of Business Administration (MBA), Luxury Brand Management, International Relations, Art History & Visual Culture and Advertising & Public Relations. Richmond's Business School is an accredited higher education partner of the Chartered Management Institute. The University's BA psychology degree is accredited in partnership with the British Psychological Society. =Accreditation= Richmond is a \\"recognised body\\" that can award UK degrees, subject to regular inspection by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) and regulation by the Office for Students. The last QAA inspection was in May 2016, which led to the award of taught degree awarding powers (following Richmond's addressing of concerns raised in the report) for a six year period from 17 May 2017 to 16 May 2024. Prior to this, Richmond's UK degrees were validated by the Open University. Richmond is accredited in the US State of Delaware by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, an accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education. Richmond is licensed to award US Associate in Arts, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts and Master of Business Administration degrees by the Department of Education in the State of Delaware. Campuses Main building, Richmond Hill campus The university is split between two main campuses in the Greater London area: the Richmond campus, located near the crest of Richmond Hill and approximately from Richmond station, and the Kensington campus, located between Kensington High Street and Cromwell Road. Richmond's library facilities across both the Hill and Kensington Campuses include over 60,000 books and DVDs, 39,000 e-journal titles and 36,000 newspapers and newswires. =Richmond Hill= The Richmond campus is the primary residence of undergraduate students in their first two years of study and its main building is a major symbol for the university.

He was later also MP for Appleby. He enjoyed the patronage of John Lambert, who he served under during the First English Civil War, which helped his parliamentary career, but also later led to his downfall when the Royalists regained power in 1660. Life and career Adam Baynes was the eldest son of Robert Baynes and Joan Brown, of Knostrop Hall, east of Leeds, where his family had resided since at least the middle of the sixteenth century. He was baptised on 22 December 1622 in Leeds. During the First English Civil War, Baynes joined the Parliamentarian army, serving under Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax. After initially serving as a captain in the infantry, he raised a cavalry troop, and subsequently fought at the battles of Adwalton Moor and Marston Moor. He subsequently served as an officer under John Lambert, who had command of the northern brigade from August 1647. Baynes was moved to London, where he acted as the brigade's financial agent, purchasing lands, soldier's debts and estates for his fellow officers. He purchased the Holdenby House estate for himself in 1650, though he was criticised for the personal profits he made from the transactions. He married Martha () in July 1650, and the pair had sixteen children, ten of whom outlived Baynes. The patronage of Lambert helped Baynes to gain election to the First Protectorate Parliament in 1654, and he was returned again two years later to the Second Protectorate Parliament. He was described as \\"an army agent of some influence at Whitehall\\",The Story of English Towns - Leeds J. S. Fletcher, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1919 and was generally sympathetic towards Quakers. After Lambert was removed from his position by Oliver Cromwell, Baynes also left his position, though it is unclear if he was removed or resigned. In 1659, Leeds did not have a seat in Parliament, and Baynes was instead elected as an MP for Appleby. Baynes continued to support Lambert in the House of Commons, opposing the vote to make Richard Cromwell the second Lord Protector. The dissolution of The Protectorate in 1659 allowed Baynes to return to the Army, but a year later the Royalist favouring Convention Parliament had him arrested and had to forfeit the crown lands he had purchased. He kept most of his Holdenby estate and received an appointment as \\"crown receiver for the manor of Leeds\\". He suffered financial issues in the mid-1660s, and was sent to the Tower of London in 1666 for \\"treasonable practices\\". He died around 5 January 1671, and left \\"houses, coalpits, and a 'considerable colliery'\\" to his family.

Usually sold as a white or tan powder, heptachlor is one of the cyclodiene insecticides. In 1962, Rachel Carson's Silent Spring questioned the safety of heptachlor and other chlorinated insecticides. Due to its highly stable structure, heptachlor can persist in the environment for decades. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has limited the sale of heptachlor products to the specific application of fire ant control in underground transformers. The amount that can be present in different foods is regulated.Robert L. Metcalf \\"Insect Control\\" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. Synthesis Analogous to the synthesis of other cyclodienes, heptachlor is produced via the Diels-Alder reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene and cyclopentadiene. The resulting adduct is chlorinated followed by treatment with hydrogen chloride in nitromethane in the presence of aluminum trichloride or with iodine monochloride. Compared to chlordane, it is about 3–5 times more active as an insecticide, but more inert chemically, being resistant to water and caustic alkalies. Metabolism Soil microorganisms transform heptachlor by epoxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction. When the compound was incubated with a mixed culture of organisms, chlordene (hexachlorocyclopentadine, its precursor) formed, which was further metabolized to chlordene epoxide. Other metabolites include 1-hydroxychlordene, 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene, and heptachlor epoxide. Soil microorganisms hydrolyze heptachlor to give ketochlordene. Rats metabolize heptachlor to the epoxide 1-exo-1-hydroxyheptachlor epoxide and 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene. When heptachlor epoxide was incubated with microsomal preparations form liver of pigs and from houseflies, the products found were diol and 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene. The metabolic scheme in rats shows two pathways with the same metabolite. The first involves following scheme: heptachlor → heptachlor epoxide → dehydrogenated derivative of 1-exo-hydroxy-2,3-exo- epoxychlordene → 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene. The second involves: heptachlor → 1-exo-hydroxychlordene → 1-exo-hydroxy, 2,3-exo-epoxychlordene → 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene. California Environmental Protection Agency (1999). Public Health Goal for Heptachlor and Heptachlor Epoxide In Drinking Water - Office of Environment Health Hazard Assessment, California Environmental Protection Agency. (retrieved on April 04, 2009). Environmental impact Heptachlor is persistent organic pollutant (POP). It has a half life of ~1.3-4.2 days (air), ~0.03-0.11 years (water), and ~0.11-0.34 years (soil). One study described its half life to be 2 years and claimed that its residues could be found in soil 14 years after its initial application. Like other POPs, heptachlor is lipophilic and poorly soluble in water (0.056 mg/L at 25 °C), thus it tends to accumulate in the body fat of humans and animals. Heptachlor epoxide is more likely to be found in the environment than its parent compound. The epoxide also dissolves more easily in water than its parent compound and is more persistent. Heptachlor and its epoxide absorb to soil particles and evaporate.ATSDR, (2007). Heptachlor and Heptachlor Epoxide - Fact Sheet . Toxicity of heptachlor and related derivatives The range of oral rat values are 40 mg/kg to 162 mg/kg. Daily oral doses of heptachlor at 50 and 100 mg/kg were found to be lethal to rats after 10 days. For heptachlor epoxide, the oral LD50 values ranging from 46.5 to 60 mg/kg. With rat oral of LD5047mg/kg, heptachlor epoxide is more toxic. A product of hydrogenation of heptachlor, β-dihydroheptachlor, has high insecticidal activity and low mammalian toxicity, rat oral LD50>5,000mg/kg. Human impact Humans may be exposed to heptachlor through drinking water and foods, including breast milk. Heptachlor epoxide is derived from a pesticide that was banned in the U.S. in the 1980s. It is still found in soil and water supplies and can turn up in food. It can be passed along in breast milk. The International Agency for Research on Cancer and the EPA have classified the compound as a possible human carcinogen. Animals exposed to heptachlor epoxide during gestation and infancy are found to have changes in nervous system and immune function. Exposure to higher doses of heptachlor in newborn animals leads to decreased body weight and death. The U.S. EPA MCL for drinking water is 0.0004 mg/L for heptachlor and 0.0002 mg/L for heptachlor epoxide. The U.S. FDA limit on food crops is 0.01 ppm, in milk 0.1 ppm, and on edible seafoods 0.3 ppm. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has limit of 0.5 mg/m3 (cubic meter of workplace air) for 8-hour shifts and 40-hour work weeks. An ATSDR report in 1993 found no studies with respect to death in humans after oral exposure to heptachlor or heptachlor epoxide. Chemical properties The octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) of heptachlor is ~105.27. Henry's Law constant is 2.3 · 10−3atm-m3/mol and the vapor pressure is 3 · 10−4mmHg at 20 °C.EPA, (2002).

The Grove Press (New York) published Beckett's English translation in 1964. An advance text of his English translation of the third part appeared in the 1962 issue of the Australian literary journal, Arna.Beckett, Samuel, How it is. Extract from Comment c'est, translated from the French by the author, in Arna 1962, Faculty of Arts Society, University of Sydney L'Image, an early variant version of Comment c'est, was published in the British arts review, X: A Quarterly Review (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form. “L’Image”, X: A Quarterly Review, ed. David Wright & Patrick Swift, Vol. I, No. 1, November 1959 Beckett Exhibition Harry Ransom Centre University of Texas at Austin The novel is a monologue by the narrator as he crawls through endless mud, recalling his life separated into three distinct periods.  Synopsis  The title is Beckett's literal translation of the French phrase, comment c'est (how it is), a pun on the French verb commencer or 'to begin'. The text is divided into three parts: \\"before Pim\\" - the solitary narrator journeys in the mud-dark until he encounters another creature like himself thereby forming a \\"couple\\". His journey is abundant with recollections from his life above, including reminiscences of a woman and of his parents. \\"with Pim\\" - the narrator is motionless in the mud-dark until he is abandoned by Pim. \\"after Pim\\" - the narrator returns to his earlier solitude but without motion in the mud-dark. He postulates that there must be several others like him and Pim. As the attempted explanation however requires a constant accumulation of ad hoc hypotheses, he acknowledges the wish for a simpler explanation. Only the mud and the obscurity remain certainties. In a letter (April 6, 1960) to Donald McWhinnie of the BBC Radio Drama Company, Beckett explained his strange text as the product of a \\" 'man' lying panting in the mud and dark murmuring his 'life' as he hears it obscurely uttered by a voice inside him... The noise of his panting fills his ears and it is only when this abates that he can catch and murmur forth a fragment of what is being stated within... It is in the third part that occurs the so-called voice 'quaqua', its interiorisation and murmuring forth when the panting stops. That is to say the 'I' is from the outset in the third part and the first and second, though stated as heard in the present, already over.\\" James Knowlson, Damned to Fame, Bloomsbury, 1996, pp. 461-62.  Theme  The theme may be the struggle of form to emerge from formlessness using Leopardi's sense of the world as mud (E fango è il mondo) and therefore, a kind of purgatory, as well as Dante's image of souls gulping mud in the Stygian marsh of the Inferno (Canto VII, 109–126, in Palma's translation): :Set in the slime, they say: 'We were sullen, with :no pleasure in the sweet, sun-gladdened air, :carrying in our souls the fumes of sloth. :Now we are sullen in this black ooze' – where :they hymn this in their throats with a gurgling sound :because they cannot form the words down there.Dante Alighieri, Inferno, translated by Michael Palma, W. W. Norton & Company, 2002, p. 77 Dante's Belacqua and his foetal position also are referenced in How It Is and the following quotation is an example of the work's unpunctuated, dense, and poetic style: :the knees drawn up the back bent in a hoop the tiny head near the knees curled round the sack Belacqua fallen over on his side :tired of waiting forgotten of the hearts where grace abides asleepSamuel Beckett, How It Is, John Calder Publishers, 1964.  Influence  Jean-Luc Godard's 1962 short film \\"La Paresse\\" begins and ends with shots of Eddie Constantine and Nicole Mirel reading Beckett's work as well as of the text itself. The novel served as inspiration for Miroslaw Balka's 2009 work, How It Is, in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. The character of the 'Angsal', the mysterious angel in Jerry Hunter's mud-soaked novel Ebargofiant (Y Lolfa, 2014) is an intertextual reference.

This design placed the bellows vertically and underneath the reeds, and served as the model for the suction operated American-style reed organ.Robert F. Gellerman The American Reed Organ and the Harmonium The Vestal Press, New York. 1996. p.19 By the early 1870s they were considered the largest and most important manufacturer of reed organs, employing about 500 and producing as many as 200 instruments a week. Mason & Hamlin supplied organs to several prominent composers, notably Franz Liszt, whose name the company applied to their patented selective sustain mechanism for organs comparable to the sostenuto in pianos. Mason & Hamlin began manufacturing pianos in 1883. Initially they built only upright pianos featuring a patented method of tuning and maintaining string tension which they marketed as the screw stringer and intended as an improvement over the traditional system with tuning pins.\\"Improved Upright Pianos\\" The Manufacturer and Builder vol.16, no. 12, December 1884 pp.282-283 In 1895, the piano department was completely reorganized by Richard W. Gertz, an independent piano designer from Germany who had created new scales for them earlier that year. Gertz was elected secretary of the company in 1903, and president in 1906,Alfred Dolge Pianos and their Makers vol.2, Covina Publishing Company, Covina CA. 1913. pp.144-150 and had patented the company's Tension Resonator, a device fastened to the perimeter of the wooden structure of pianos meant to prevent their sounding boards from flattening. This was first included in their grands in 1900. The firm advertises that it is currently used in all Mason & Hamlin pianos.Piano Specifications Mason & Hamlin website (accessed October 11, 2008) = 20th century = By the turn of the 20th century, the Golden Age of the Piano was in full force and the most illustrious concert artists of the day aligned themselves with piano manufacturers including Sergei Rachmaninoff whose 1924 recording of his Second Piano Concerto was made using a Mason & Hamlin. Composer Maurice Ravel said of Mason & Hamlin pianos, \\"While preserving all the qualities of the percussion instrument, the Mason & Hamlin pianoforte also serves magnificently the composer's concept by its extensive range in dynamics, as well as quality of tone.

In 1932 it became part of Aeolian-American when the two companies merged, which consolidated the control of more than twenty brands of pianos; Mason & Hamlin, which had been at the former Hallet, Davis & Company piano factory in Neponset, Massachusetts, was moved to a separate plant at the Aeolian-American complex in East Rochester, New York at this time. During this time the company began sponsoring the Mason and Hamlin Prize piano competition. Piano manufacturing ceased in the United States in 1942 under authority of the War Production Board due to the Second World War, and Mason & Hamlin production shifted to military gliders.\\"Mason & Hamlin\\", Grove Music Online, 2007. Accessed June 2, 2007. Ownership of Mason & Hamlin changed hands several times during the post-war era, becoming part of the Sohmer piano company in 1985. Over the decades, the designs of the pianos were altered to the extent that they had little in common with the \\"classic\\" Mason & Hamlin pianos of the pre-Depression era . In 1989, Seattle businessman Bernard \\"Bud\\" Greer purchased the Sohmer company, which also held the George Steck, Knabe, and Mason & Hamlin names, technical specifications, and manufacturing equipment. He moved these to a piano factory in Haverhill, Massachusetts, which he had recently purchased from piano manufacturer Santi Falcone—from whom he also purchased the Falcone manufacturing specifications and naming rights. He named the new enterprise the Mason & Hamlin Companies. Greer's goal was to resurrect the Mason & Hamlin pianos of the pre-Depression era by returning to the original specifications—including Gertz's scale designs—and use of materials. A few changes were made, including the use of Renner action parts and slightly longer keys. From 1990 to 1994, approximately 600 pianos were manufactured, mostly Model A and BB grands, along with a few Model 50 uprights. Greer sold the company in 1995 to Premier Pianos, which continued production at a reduced pace until selling the company in 1996. =Today= In 1996, Mason & Hamlin was acquired by Burgett, Inc., which also owns PianoDisc, a maker of reproducing piano systems of the same name. Mason & Hamlin pianos are still manufactured in Haverhill, Massachusetts, and distributed throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. Mason & Hamlin is a member of NAMM, the International Music Products Association and Piano Manufacturers Association International. Each Mason & Hamlin piano includes a Tension Resonator, which is a system of steel rods under moderate tension, anchored to the wooden structure on the opposite side of the sounding board from the strings and iron frame. In grand pianos these rods fan out from one or two central hubs and are attached at intervals around the rim and to the belly rail; the model 50 upright has a rod stretched between the case sides. The manufacturer claims that this adds strength and rigidity to the rim by locking the rim into its permanent shape and which in turn preserves the \\"crown\\" of the soundboard. Fine, Larry.

It was released 30 August 2005. The album was recorded in late 2004 with producer Tore Johansson in Malmö, Sweden and mixed by Dave Sardy in Los Angeles. It is the final album to feature guitarist Andy Duncan, who left shortly after recording finished. As of January 12, 2007, the album had sold 198,045 units. After the band's performance at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, their album moved up to #2 on the iTunes Music Store album sales charts (as of September 3, 2006). Their album sold 8,250 units in the following week, a 95% increase over the prior week, rocketing from #87 to #69 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the highest position ever achieved by any OK Go album until the release of Of the Blue Colour of the Sky five years later. On November 7, 2006, OK Go released a deluxe limited edition CD/DVD of the album. The DVD contains their videos (dancing and playing instruments), a video from 180 fans doing the \\"A Million Ways\\" dance for a YouTube contest, previously unseen footage, and a behind- the-scenes look of their treadmill rehearsals for the video and for the VMAs. Track listing :\\"9027 km\\" is a 35-minute track on the US version of the album that is not included on the cover sleeve. It is a low-grade recording of frontman Damian Kulash's sleeping girlfriend. After parting with the label, Kulash would later admit that was a hasty recording that he made before submitting the final album to the record label. The track was added to pad out the CD and thereby prevent their label from using the extra space to add DRM software, which would limit transfer of the music from the CD. Kulash justified the inclusion of this track to the label as an old \\"love note\\" recording sent from his girlfriend while he was away recording the album and that it would have to be included in its entirety as his artistic license. He later reported that the label could have easily uncovered the truth - that the track was a hasty addition - because there were faint sounds of fireworks in the background of the recording, dating the recording to the 4th of July just before it was submitted. The name of the track is based on the distance between Malmö, Sweden and Los Angeles, California (9027 kilometers), where Kulash and his girlfriend were respectively based during the production of the album. Reception Oh No has received positive reviews, and holds an aggregated 64 out of 100, based out of 14 critics, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\".

Dubbed by TBS as a \\"first of its kind broadband gaming network\\", the service provided users with classic arcade video games and game- related video content. The service was acquired by French online video game service Metaboli in 2008 as a wholly owned subsidiary aiming to create a global games service. The service remained active until October 2015, where it was quietly shut-down by its parent-company. Features GameTap was conceived primarily as an online subscription rental service, competing against mail-based services like GameFly. GameTap offered two subscription levels: a Premium subscription with access to the entire content library, and a Classic subscription with access to older console and arcade games running in emulation. GameTap also sold games via the online distribution method. GameTap initially offered a limited selection of games for free play without a subscription, but this option was discontinued. Originally, GameTap was designed to offer not only video games, but a complete media hub (GameTap TV), taking advantage of the TBS catalog as well as offering original video content, including the animated series Revisioned: Tomb Raider and new episodes of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. GameTap TV has since been discontinued. Most multiplayer games can be played by two users on the same computer while many others not originally intended to be played outside of a LAN may be played over the internet by using a VPN client such as Hamachi. A limited number of games have been enhanced with an online leaderboard and challenge lobby, adding internet multiplayer to games that previously could only be played face to face. Every Monday GameTap holds a leaderboard tournament with a different game each week. =GameTap Originals= GameTap has funded the development of a number of titles, with the games subsequently premiering as GameTap exclusives. Such games include Sam & Max Season One and Myst Online: Uru Live. On February 7, 2007, GameTap announced their third original game, Galactic Command: Echo Squad, from independent developer 3000AD. The four-part episodic game is a space combat title formerly planned for launch in the Summer of 2007. However, it suffered from constant delays, and in early 2008, GameTap announced that it had canceled its deal with 3000AD. \\"It was a good game, it was very solid, but as we were going through, it ended up not being the right title for our audience,\\" says Ricardo Sanchez. \\"It was a tough call. I think it’s one of the strongest games [Derek] ever made. We put a lot of effort into it...I honestly think it's one of Derek’s strongest games.\\" On May 15, 2007, PC Gamer magazine premiered the first look at GameTap's newest original game, American McGee's Grimm, a 24 part episodic series by game designer American McGee. History GameTap launched on October 17, 2005 with over 300 games and had grown to over 1,000. The service was the idea of Turner employee Blake Lewin. The initial list of game licensees included Activision, Atari, Intellivision Lives!, Midway, Namco, Sega, and Taito. After its inception, more companies licensed their software, including: Eidos Interactive, G-Mode, Ubisoft, Codemasters, Vivendi Games, Konami, Electronic Arts, Capcom, Take-Two Interactive, Interplay and SNK Playmore. On 1 May 2007, GameTap revised its business model to utilize three different service levels: Visitor, Green, and Gold. The Visitor and Green levels were free, had access to a limited selection of games, and were supported by advertising. Green members registered with the site and received access to a few more games. Gold members were essentially identical to paid subscribers as before. On November 29, 2007, GameTap announced that as of December 11, over 70 games would be removed from their catalog, many of them Electronic Arts or Interplay titles, likely due to expiration of the two-year licensing agreement with those companies. On January 10, 2008 a GameTap staff member announced the return of the Humongous Games license which restored popular games such as the likes of Putt Putt and Pajama Sam back to the library. On August 6, 2008, Turner Broadcasting announced they were looking to sell GameTap. On September 24, 2008, Time Warner sold the service to Paris- based Metaboli. Turner continued to handle GameTap's operations during the transition period, which lasted until 2009. After the transition, the service became available to non-US/Canadian residents. On March 31, 2009, GameTap Player was replaced by the plug-in after saying goodbyes to their players, GameTap's business model was again changed - into a GameTap Plug-In; the service was then handled through the website. The subscription levels were changed to Free Pack (selected handful of games for free), a new Classic Pack (reduced-price version of the full service which does not include Windows games), and Premium Pack (the Gold membership). However, due to technical issues, many features offered previously were disabled during the migration. Users with 64-bit versions of Windows could only play games that are marked as 64-bit compatible. GameTap was working on encrypting the rest of their Windows catalog with Yummy encryption to make them 64-bit compatible. On October 14, 2010, the American office of Metaboli was shut down and all operations moved to Paris, thus cutting all ties with original Turner employees. Reception GameTap was criticized for its cancellation process, which required customers to contact live support personnel; such calls were noted by reviewers to be deliberately protracted by support staff in an effort to retain subscribers.\\"VC&G; Review: GameTap\\", Vintage Computing and Gaming, http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/97, visited June 23, 2006 References External links * GameTap official site - Archived * List of Games in GameTap Service * GameTap design blog Category:Online video game services Category:Multi-emulators Category:Turner Broadcasting System Category:MacOS games Category:Windows games Category:Internet properties established in 2005 Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2015 ","title":"GameTap"},{"id":"2145951","text":"Brian Barry, 1980s Brian Barry, (7 August 1936 – 10 March 2009) was a moral and political philosopher.

The city, founded in 1607, was named by Mughal Emperor Jehangir himself - the city's first name is recorded in the Emperor's autobiography, the Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, in which he refers to the town as Jehangir pura. The city then came to be known by its current name, which derives from Jehangir's nickname Shekhu that was given to him by his mother, wife of Akbar the Great.District Profile: Central Punjab- Sheikhupura  History  The Sheikhupura Fort was established in 1607. = Mughal = Mughal Emperor Jahangir laid the foundations of Sheikhupura in 1607 near the older town of Jandiala Sher Khan, an important provincial town during the early to middle Mughal era. He also erected the nearby Hiran Minar, Sheikhpura's most renowned site, between 1607 and 1620 as a monument to his beloved pet deer, Mansiraj, at a time when the area served as a royal hunting ground for the Mughal Emperor. Jehangir laid the foundation of the Sheikhupura Fort in 1607, which is situated in the city's centre. = Sikh = Following the collapse of Mughal authority, the city came under the control of the Bhatti tribe. The tribe struggled to maintain control of the area, as bandits and Sikhs began encroaching upon the area. In 1797, the Durrani king Shah Zaman briefly seized the city and fortress during his campaign to capture Lahore. The city's fort then was captured by the Sikh bandit, Inder Singh. Sheikhupura was then captured from the Bhattis by the forces of Lehna Singh in 1799. Sheikhupura thus came under the rule of the Sikh Sukherchakia Misl state under Lehna Singh's ally, Ranjit Singh, forcing the Bhatti tribe to retreat to Pindi Bhattian and Jalalpur. Sheikhupura then changed hands several more times, before finally being captured by Ranjit Singh in 1808. Sheikhupura remained under suzerainty of the Sikh Empire until 1847, when the British seized control of the area. The British imprisoned the last Queen of the Sikh Empire, Maharani Jind Kaur, at the Sheikhpura Fort for ten months until 1848 before ultimately condemning her to exile abroad. = British = Following establishment of British colonial rule, Bhatti possessions that had been seized by the Sikhs were restored. The large area between the Chenab and Ravi rivers were initially consolidated into a single district with Sheikhupura serving as its first headquarters, until 1851. The area around Sheikhupura attained District status in 1919, with M.M.L. Karry serving as its first administrator. = Partition = On the eve of the Partition of British India, Sikhs made up 19% of the district's population. Despite the area's Muslim majority, Sikhs had hoped that the boundary commission would award the area to India, given the proximity of Sheikhupura to the city of Nankana Sahib - revered as the birthplace of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak. The city was spared the large-scale rioting that engulfed Lahore earlier in 1947, and the city's Sikh population did not shift to India before the Radcliffe Line that demarcated the border of the newly independent states of Pakistan and India was announced. The Sikh population had not made arrangements to leave and remained trapped in the city until 31 August 1947. The city's Sacha Sauda refugee camp hosted upwards of 100,000 Sikh refugees who had come to the city after fleeing nearby Gujranwala and other surrounding areas earlier that year. Fierce violence erupted in the city, and an estimated 10,000 people were killed in Sheikhupura between 16 August and 31 August in communal rioting between Sikhs and Muslims. Education The overall literacy rate of Sheikhupura is 43.6% which is increasing day by day.https://www.ilmkidunya.com/colleges/colleges-in-sheikhupura.aspx Following are some of the notable educational institutes of the city: *Hajvery University, Sheikhupura Campus *University of Central Punjab, Sheikhupura Campushttps://cps.ucp.edu.pk/campus-fac?campus_id=MzQ= *Punjab College of Science *The Superior College *Lahore Grammar School *Beaconhouse School System *The City School Demographics According to the 1998 Pakistan Census, the population of Sheikhupura city was recorded as 280,263.

Set within this frame can be louvers (both operable or fixed, horizontal or vertical), solid panels, fabric, glass and almost any other item that can be mounted within a frame. Shutters may be employed for a variety of reasons, including controlling the amount of sunlight that enters a room, to provide privacy, security, to protect against weather or unwanted intrusion or damage and to enhance the aesthetics of a building. Depending on the application, and the construction of the window frame, shutters can be mounted to fit within the opening or to overlap the opening. The term window shutter includes both interior shutters, used on the inside of a house or building, and exterior shutters, used on the outside of a structure. On some styles of buildings it is common to have shutters to cover the doors as well as the windows. Interior shutters Modern interior wooden window shutters Interior shutters are typically divided into narrow units hinged accordion-style so that two or more units cover each side of a window opening when closed. Operable louvered shutters have louvers (or louvres in British usage), or slats, controlled by a tilt bar or rod to adjust the louver position and keep them in a uniform position, to control light, visibility and airflow. Shutters with operable louvers are described variously as traditional shutters, California shutters, or plantation shutters. Plantation shutters, typical of warmer climates like Florida, South Africa, the Mediterranean or Australia, typically have only two shutters per window and wide louver blades. Other interior shutters use stationary louvers that do not rotate (fixed louvers); solid raised or flat panels; fabric inserts; or tinted glass. Shutters can be configured in a single tier unit that has one shutter top to bottom of a window opening as well as multiple tiers. Multiple tier units feature separate shutters on each tier which allows the top shutters to be opened independently from the bottom shutters. Café-type shutters refer to shutters that only cover the lower portion of a window. Full height shutters can be made with a horizontal divider rail which separates the upper and lower portions of the shutter. With operable louvered shutters this gives greater control as the louvers above the divider rail can be operated independently from the louvers below the divider rail. Interior shutters can be constructed from numerous woods, which can be painted or stained, and a variety of synthetic materials. Interior shutters that are made to close tolerances are preferable for the best possible fit. When louvers or tilt bar (rod) become damaged, replacement kits for these damaged parts may be ordered online and are easy to install. In the UK, most interior shutters historically were paneled. Exterior shutters Brightly colored shutters in Romania One side shutters in Poland Shutters are frequently seen in French-influenced architecture. The old town of Dinkelsbühl, Germany, completely consists of houses with colored exterior shutters. Exterior shutters were originally constructed for light control, privacy, security and protection from the elements. Functional shutters hinge on each side of a window or at the top and swing closed when necessary and can also be mounted on tracks applied to the face of the building. Fixed and operable louvers shed rain, allow air transfer, filter direct sunlight, protect from small flying debris, and provide privacy. Operable louvered shutters allow for greater control of light and ventilation. Solid panels and board-and-batten shutters are generally used for security or protection during severe weather. Non-functional shutters are merely used to enhance the appearance of a building. Functional shutters have traditionally been constructed from solid woods that have proven to endure outside elements but have also been mass-produced in woods less suitable to the outdoors like pine. Finishing wood shutters is recommended for extended life. Composite shutters offer advantages over wood shutters such as resistance to twisting, splitting, and rotting. However, PVC shutters are often hinged with three or more hinges and painted with vinyl-safe paint to keep from bowing in the sun and can require additional hardware. Fiberglass shutters are more dimensionally stable than PVC. Certain hardwoods currently used for exterior shutters, specifically Spanish cedar, Honduran mahogany and teak, are resistant to rot and decay, and far more durable than a softer wood like untreated pine. Because of the tannin in these woods they are also not prone to problems from insects. Pressure treatment with wood preservative makes pine, cedar and other types of wood suitable for exterior shutters. Non-functional exterior shutters can be constructed from wood, vinyl, fiberglass or other synthetic materials. Non- functional shutters can be simply screwed or bolted directly to the building, with spacers or other hardware to prevent water accumulating against the wall. Fiberglass, a material widely used for boat hulls, is not prone to rotting or twisting, is dimensionally stable and has low expansion and contraction. It is a reinforced plastic, unlike vinyl or PVC, so fiberglass shutters do not have a tendency to warp or sag. Its strength is comparable to aluminum; however, it does not suffer from corrosion and electrolysis. Exterior shutters in France, notably in Paris, are frequently made of steel and are configured in multiple narrow full-length panels, allowing them to fold open and fit inconspicuously against the recesses at the sides of the window. Some exterior shutters in Italy, such as in towns along the Adriatic coast, slide on rollers into pockets in the wall at each side of the window. In Germany and other parts of Europe, rolling exterior shutters on tracks have become ubiquitous, although they lack the decorative value of traditional shutters. When open, these type shutters roll up into boxes concealed in the thickness of the wall above the window. They are typically raised and lowered manually, such as by a rolling pull made of flat nylon cord, but they can be equipped with electric operating mechanisms. These shutters allow some light in the room when not fully lowered, but wholly block light when completely closed. Variations include frame extensions that allow the closed shutter to swing out like an awning or Bermuda shutter. An exterior hurricane shutter or storm shutter is used to protect windows and doors in a building against the effects of high winds, rain, and flying objects during a hurricane, or as a security shutter over an opening. They can be made of a variety of materials such as fiberglass, steel, aluminum, wood or composite wood and can be installed in tracks to be quickly opened and closed manually or with motorized controls. The track-mounted storm shutters in America are of German design and are frequently of German manufacture. The walls of American houses are typically too thin to conceal the boxes that hold the shutters when open, so the boxes are visible on the exterior above the windows. There are also high-impact-resistant plastics that can be applied to new or existing wood shutters that provide hurricane protection.

Starring Kirby, it is the fifth installment in the Kirby series and the third game under the Kirby's Dream Land name. Although the first two games were largely unrelated, Dream Land 3 features many similar characters to Dream Land 2. Dream Land 3 was followed by Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards in 2000. Kirby's Dream Land 3 was the last SNES game published by Nintendo in North America. Problems with the game's PAL conversion prevented it from being released in Europe and Australia for many years; it was eventually released for the Virtual Console in those regions in the form of an import from North America on July 24, 2009 for the Wii and on July 25, 2013 for the Wii U. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console in North America on January 5, 2009 for the Wii and on May 8, 2013 for the Wii U and in Japan on April 28, 2009 for the Wii and on May 8, 2013 for the Wii U. It was also included as part of the 2012 Wii compilation Kirby's Dream Collection and the Nintendo Switch Online SNES game service. Plot Kirby and Gooey are on a fishing trip, when suddenly, Dark Matter appears and shatters the planet's rings. He then possesses various Dream Landers, including King Dedede. Kirby and Gooey team up with Rick, Coo, and Kine, as well as new characters Pitch, ChuChu, and Nago. Two endings exist for the game, based on whether the player has collected all the Heart Stars. If the player has not collected all the stars, Kirby and his friends fight King Dedede, who is possessed by Dark Matter. Once Dedede is defeated once, Dark Matter begins to reveal himself, and Kirby must fight Dedede for a second consecutive time. After Dark Matter is defeated, Kirby and Gooey set off on the journey home, only to pause hesitantly at several points along the way. At the end of the credits, the camera pans up to focus on a huge, shadowed orb with one massive eye. This mysterious figure is Zero, the ultimate leader of the Dark Matter Army. If the player has collected all the stars, the player proceeds to fight Dedede as normal. However, Dark Matter then emerges and flies into the atmosphere, with Kirby in hot pursuit, armed with a weapon called the Love-Love Stick, assembled from all the Heart Stars he collected during his journey. After a climactic battle with Dark Matter, Zero himself emerges, leading to a long and difficult battle. After Zero is defeated, peace is finally restored to the universe. Gameplay The game's platforming mechanics are very similar to most other Kirby games, as is Kirby's skillset. Kirby is able to jump, duck, slide, fly (by inflating himself), as well as perform his signature move: inhaling enemies. When Kirby inhales an enemy, it can be spit back out as a projectile, or swallowed. Normally this has no effect on Kirby, although specific enemies grant Kirby copy abilities, a staple of the Kirby games. Copy abilities replace Kirby's standard inhaling move with a special attack, depending on the enemy Kirby ate. For example, swallowing a fire-based enemy allows Kirby to become a fireball. Zero is the game's secret and true final boss; defeating him is key in achieving the best ending. Zero takes the form of a giant eye with a red iris, and is responsible for leading the Dark Matter invasion of Dreamland. Zero is famous for being a rare example of graphic violence in a first-party Nintendo game – Zero fights Kirby by opening cuts on his sclera and shooting blood out of the cuts at him, as well as summoning small Dark Matters to use as projectiles. When his health is drastically weakened, his iris rips out from the rest of his body, with blood flying everywhere as it does so. The ruined body, complete with a vicious gash to its front from where the eye burst out trails away, and the final phase of the fight begins, which involves Zero ramming Kirby to injure him. Although he is eventually defeated, Zero reappears in Kirby 64 as '02' (pronounced zero two), retaining his ability to spit blood and his motif as a giant eye. As a reference to his previous fight with Kirby, 02 wears two large plasters on the top of his 'head', covering the wound left from his iris bursting out of his body. =Kirby's allies= At any time during play, Kirby can summon Gooey—a blue, long-tongued blob first seen in Dream Land 2. Doing so costs Kirby two hit points. When controlled by the computer or also a second human player, Gooey's abilities are similar to Kirby's: He can swallow enemies using his long tongue, then either spit them out or copy their abilities to a limited extent. Gooey's tongue is also capable of obtaining items similarly to Kirby's inhale, though it is also capable of grabbing stars, which Kirby would need to touch in order to obtain. Kirby can also inhale Gooey and swallow him, reclaiming his two hit points. In addition to Gooey, Kirby can team up with any one of his six other Animal Friends, three of which were introduced in the previous game in the series. This friend mechanic allows Kirby to be ridden, carried or rolled, enabling new team-based abilities, as well as variations of Kirby's copy abilities. The friends Kirby can team up with are: * Rick the Hamster, who can only jump once but can stomp on enemies, run faster, doesn't slide on ice, and can scale walls. * Coo the Owl, who can fly quickly (even against strong gusts of wind) and can let Kirby inhale in mid-air. * Kine the Ocean Sunfish, who can only jump once but can stomp on enemies, swim more efficiently in water (even against strong currents), and can let Kirby inhale underwater. * Nago the Calico Cat, who can stomp on enemies and triple-jump. * Pitch the Bird, who has more versatile copy ability variants than the other Animal Friends, but cannot fly against strong winds like Coo can and is much more limited in flying due to his small size, only being able to fly like how Kirby can float. * Chuchu the Octopus, who can only float for a limited time before gradually descending, but is able to cling to and walk across ceilings and can grab items with her tentacles (identically to Gooey's tongue; in both cases, this function is only usable without an ability as it replaces Kirby's inhale ability). Numerous puzzles in the game make use of the Animal Friends' different gameplay styles, and usually require the player to master them in order to be completed. For example, one mission that has Kirby escort Rick to the end of the level features numerous high walls to scale and large gaps bridged by enemies to stomp on, and another mission makes Kirby use the Clean ability with Pitch to water some flowers. In many other cases, however, the Animal Friends serve as a supplement to the gameplay with the purpose of aiding the player. Additionally, each world features one Heart Star mission requiring that Kirby escort an Animal Friend to an acquaintance of theirs at the end of the level. Visuals Kirby's Dream Land 3 uses a mode of the SNES termed \\"pseudo high- resolution\\" (which allows for color blending between two adjacent pixels) to blend dithered sprites. The cartridge also takes advantage of SA-1 technology to process game data at a faster rate, which was necessary for the large number of bitmaps and special effects used by faster releases. Reception Kirby's Dream Land 3 received mixed to positive reception from both critics and fans. IGN gave Dream Land 3 a fairly positive review of the Virtual Console re-release, \\"It's not Super Star. But once you get past that, you can appreciate Dream Land 3 for what it is -- a direct, numbered follow-up to the series that started on the Game Boy.\\" Nintendo Life initially gave the game a 6 out of 10, criticizing the lack of difficulty but praising the stylized graphics. However, a different reviewer for the same website gave the Virtual Console re-release a 7 out of 10, calling Dream Land 3 a \\"lovable gaming experience\\" and a \\"worthy sequel.\\" Notes References External links *Kirby's Dream Land 3 Profile – Nintendo (Archive) *Kirby's Dream Land 3 at MobyGames *Kirby's Dream Land 3 at IGN Category:1997 video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Kirby (series) platform games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Alien invasions in video games Category:Nintendo games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with alternate endings Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Nintendo Switch Online SNES games ","title":"Kirby's Dream Land 3"},{"id":"2145975","text":"Anton Alexander von Werner (9 May 18434 January 1915) was a German painter known for his history paintings of notable political and military events in the Kingdom of Prussia.Fulbrook, Mary and John Breuilly (1997) German History Since 1800 \\"Oxford University Press US\\". 640 p. . One of the most famous painters of his time, he is regarded a main protagonist of the Wilhelmine Period. Biography Werner was born in Frankfurt (Oder) in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg, the son of a carpenter. His family originally came from East Prussia and was ennobled (von) in 1701. He began an apprenticeship as a decorative painter in 1857 and from 1860 onwards studied painting at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. One year later, he pursued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe, where he studied with Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, Ludwig des Coudres, Adolf Schroedter, and Karl Friedrich Lessing. In Karlsruhe, Werner met with artists like Eduard Devrient, Johannes Brahms and Clara Schumann, Paul Heyse, and the Norwegian painter Hans Gude. The author Joseph Victor von Scheffel, who became a close friend, introduced him to Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden, and Werner illustrated several printed editions of Scheffel's works. Werner visited Paris in 1865 and again from March 1867 to July 1868, preparing the International Exposition of 1867. He was strongly influenced by the history paintings of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Eugène Delacroix, Ernest Meissonier, and Léon Cogniet whom he also met personally. Having obtained a travelling scholarship upon the exhibition of his early works at the International Exposition, he moved to Italy in 1868 and stayed with Anselm Feuerbach in Rome until November 1869. On his return to Baden, he received several state commissions. This work in turn cites: *Kunst für Alle, vol. i *Knackfuss, Künstler-Monographieen, No. 9 The Proclamation of the German Empire (3rd version; 1885) Upon the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Werner was sent with the staff of the 3rd Corps d'Armée under the command of Prince Frederick William of Prussia in October 1870. In January 1871, he was summoned to the Prussian headquarters in VersaillesBiographie:Anton von Werner, 1843-1915, \\"German Historical Museum\\" accessed on May 2, 2006. and commissioned to immortalize the proclamation of the German Empire at the Hall of Mirrors. This painting marked Werner's final breakthrough, he became acquainted with numerous German federal princes he portrayed, met with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke, as well as with Emperor Wilhelm I. Afterwards he returned to Berlin, now the German capital, and married Malwine Schroedter, daughter of his tutor Adolf Schroedter in August 1871.Dr. Joachim Reinhardt, Anton von Werner \\"Dr. Joachim Reinhardt\\" accessed on May 2, 2006. In Berlin, Werner designed a large velarium stretching over the Unter den Linden boulevard at the triumphant arrival of the victorious German troops. He received further public commissions to create the mural decorations in the portico of the Victory Column, whereby he used his velarium as a cartoon for an innovative stained glass mosaic. He continued to commemorate the Franco-Prussian War in several commissioned paintings. In 1873 Werner was appointed professor at the Berlin Academy. His career reached its peak when he became, in 1875, director of the Academy. After 1888, while in William II's court, Werner tutored the emperor to become a painter. In 1909, he succeeded Hugo von Tschudi in directing the Nationalgalerie in Berlin.Malyon, John. ART / 4 / 2Day \\"Estate of Bernard Safran\\". accessed on May 2, 2006. He died in Berlin in 1915 and was interred at the Alter Zwölf-Apostel-Kirchhof in the Schöneberg neighborhood of Berlin. Works Crown Prince Frederick Wilhelm contemplating the corpse of French general Abel Douay, 1888) Im Etappenquartier vor Paris (A Billet Outside Paris; 1894) Unveiling of the Richard Wagner Monument in the Tiergarten (1908) Werner's more important works include The Capitulation of Sedan, Proclamation of the German Empire at Versailles, Moltke before Paris, Moltke at Versailles, The Meeting of Bismarck and Napoleon III, Christ and the Tribute Money, William I visiting the Tombs, The Congress of Berlin, and some decorations executed in mosaic for the Berlin Victory Column. Werner's work is chiefly interesting for the historic value of his pictures of the events of the Franco-Prussian War.

It is an improvement of the earlier exploding-bridgewire detonator; instead of directly coupling the shock wave from the exploding wire, the expanding plasma from an explosion of a metal foil drives another thin plastic or metal foil called a \\"flyer\\" or a \\"slapper\\" across a gap, and its high-velocity impact on the explosive (for example, PETN or hexanitrostilbene) then delivers the energy and shock needed to initiate a detonation. Normally all the slapper's kinetic energy is supplied only by the heating (and hence expansion) of the plasma (the former foil) by the current passing through it, though constructions with a \\"back strap\\" to further drive the plasma forward by magnetic field exist too. This assembly is quite efficient; up to 30% of the electrical energy can be converted to the slapper's kinetic energy. The initial explosion is usually caused by explosive vaporization of a thin metal wire or strip, by driving several thousand amperes of electric current through it, usually from a capacitor charged to several thousand volts. The switching may be done by a spark gap or a krytron. Usually the construction consists of an explosive booster pellet, against which a disk with a hole in the center is set. Over the other side of the disk, there is a layer of an insulating film, for example, Kapton or PET film, with a thin strip of metal (typically aluminum or gold) foil deposited on its outer side. A narrowed section of the metal then explosively vaporizes when a current pulse passes through it, which shears the mylar foil and the plasma ball pushes it through the hole, accelerating it to very high speed. The impact then detonates the explosive pellet. Diagram of slapper and EBW detonators initiating detonation. (A) Slapper detonator's pellet or flyer impacts a wider area of surface on the explosive output charge, and even though energy is lost to the sides of the area impacted, a cone of explosive is efficiently compressed. (B) EBW detonators only initiate a single point, and energy is lost in all directions, making the energy transfer less efficient. Advantages over explosive-bridgewire detonators include: * The foil does not come in contact with the explosive, which reduces the risk of corrosion of the foil or chemical reactions between the foil and explosive producing unstable compounds, and secondarily further reduces the risk of accidental electrical ignition of the explosive. * The energy to fire the detonator is quite low * The slapper pellet impacting an area of explosives rather than a single point as in an EBW is more reliable and efficient at initiating detonation. * The explosive can be pressed to higher density * Very insensitive explosives can be initiated directly. In a variant called laser detonator the vaporization can be caused by a high-power laser pulse delivered over-the-air or coupled by an optical fiber; this is reportedly used as a safety detonator in some mining operations and quarries. Typically a 1-watt solid-state laser is used. The slapper detonators are frequently used in modern weapon designs and aerospace technology.

Pearson of Leeds In photography, a shutter is a device that allows light to pass for a determined period, exposing photographic film or a photosensitive digital sensor to light in order to capture a permanent image of a scene. A shutter can also be used to allow pulses of light to pass outwards, as seen in a movie projector or a signal lamp. A shutter of variable speed is used to control exposure time of the film. The shutter is constructed so that it automatically closes after a certain required time interval. The speed of the shutter is controlled by a ring outside the camera, on which various timings are marked. Camera shutter The 1911 Cyclopedia of Photography divides shutters into \\"roller- blind\\" and \\"diaphragm\\" types, corresponding roughly to the modern focal-plane and leaf types. Camera shutters can be fitted in several positions: *Leaf shutters are usually fitted within a lens assembly (central shutter), or more rarely immediately behind (behind-the-lens shutter) or, even more rarely, in front of a lens, and shut off the beam of light where it is narrow. *Focal- plane shutters are mounted near the focal plane and move to uncover the film or sensor. Behind-the-lens shutters were used in some cameras with limited lens interchangeability. Shutters in front of the lens, sometimes simply a lens cap that is removed and replaced for the long exposures required, were used in the early days of photography. Other mechanisms than the dilating aperture and the sliding curtains have been used; anything which exposes the film to light for a specified time will suffice. The time for which a shutter remains open (exposure time, often called \\"shutter speed\\") is determined by a timing mechanism. These were originally pneumatic (Compound shutter) or clockwork, but since the late twentieth century are mostly electronic. Mechanical shutters typically had a Time setting, where the shutter opened when the button was pressed and remained open until it was pressed again, Bulb where the shutter remained open as long as the button was pressed (originally actuated by squeezing an actual rubber bulb), and Instantaneous exposure, with settings ranging from 30\\" to 1/4000\\" for the best leaf shutters, faster for focal-plane shutters, and more restricted for basic types. The reciprocal of exposure time in seconds is often used for engraving shutter settings. For example, a marking of \\"250\\" denotes 1/250\\". This does not cause confusion in practice. The exposure time and the effective aperture of the lens must together be such as to allow the right amount of light to reach the film or sensor. Additionally, the exposure time must be suitable to handle any motion of the subject. Usually it must be fast enough to \\"freeze\\" rapid motion, unless a controlled degree of motion blur is desired, for example to give a sensation of movement. Most shutters have a flash synchronization switch to trigger a flash, if connected. This was quite a complicated matter with mechanical shutters and flashbulbs which took an appreciable time to reach full brightness, focal-plane shutters making this even more difficult. Special flashbulbs were designed which had a prolonged burn, illuminating the scene for the whole time taken by a focal plane shutter slit to move across the film. These problems were essentially solved for non-focal-plane shutters with the advent of electronic flash units which fire virtually instantaneously and emit a very short flash. When using a focal-plane shutter with a flash, if the shutter is set at its X-sync speed or slower the whole frame will be exposed when the flash fires (otherwise only a band of the film will be exposed). Some electronic flashes can produce a longer pulse compatible with a focal-plane shutter operated at much higher shutter speeds. The focal-plane shutter will still impart focal-plane shutter distortions to a rapidly moving subject. Cinematography uses a rotary disc shutter in movie cameras, a continuously spinning disc which conceals the image with a reflex mirror during the intermittent motion between frame exposure. The disc then spins to an open section that exposes the next frame of film while it is held by the registration pin. =Focal-plane shutter= A focal-plane shutter. The plastic curtains travel vertically. A focal-plane shutter is positioned just in front of the film, in the focal plane, and moves an aperture across the film until the full frame has been exposed. Focal-plane shutters are usually implemented as a pair of light-tight cloth, metal, or plastic curtains. For shutter speeds slower than a certain point (known as the X-sync speed of the shutter), which depends on the camera, one curtain of the shutter opens, and the other closes after the correct exposure time. At shutter speeds faster than the X-sync speed, the top curtain of the shutter travels across the focal plane, with the second curtain following behind, effectively moving a slit across the focal plane until each part of the film or sensor has been exposed for the correct time. The effective exposure time can be much shorter than for central shutters, at the cost of some distortion of fast-moving subjects. Focal plane shutters have the advantage over central leaf shutters of allowing the use of interchangeable lenses without requiring a separate shutter for each lens. (Leaf shutters behind the lens also allow interchanging the lens using a single shutter.) They have several disadvantages as well: * Distortion of fast-moving subjects: although no part of the film is exposed for longer than the time set on the dial, one edge of the film is exposed an appreciable time after the other, so that a horizontally moving shutter will, for example, elongate or shorten the image of a car speeding in the same or the opposite direction to the shutter movement. * They are noisier, which is a detriment to candid and nature photography. * Their more complex mechanical structure causes a shorter life-span than other shutter designs. * If a focal-plane shutter camera is left with sunlight falling on the lens (and the mirror up for an SLR), it is possible to burn a hole in the closed curtain of a non- metal shutter. * Camera shake due to the impact of the larger curtains starting and stopping rapidly. Camera designers have learned to overcome SLR mirror-slap by including a mirror lock-up feature in some cameras. This removes the camera-shake from the large slapping mirror inside the camera, but does not prevent camera-shake caused by the shutter mechanism itself. Mirror- lock-up introduces yet another problem: with the mirror locked-up out of the way the optical viewfinder cannot be used for focussing, framing, or exposure metering. Newer DSLR cameras include a \\"live preview\\" where the image from the main imaging sensor is displayed directly on an LCD display, so it is still possible to focus (manually or in newer models by contrast detection) and frame. This prevents most camera shake from the focal-plane shutter, as instead of a first curtain an electronic shutter is used. =Simple leaf shutter= thumbright250pxSimple leaf shutter 1\\\\. Shutter plate 2\\\\. Aperture covered by leaf shutter 3\\\\. Aperture during exposure 4\\\\. Leaf blade 5\\\\. Catch mechanism 6\\\\. Butterfly spring A simple leaf shutter is a type of camera shutter consisting of a mechanism with one or more pivoting metal leaves which normally does not allow light through the lens onto the film, but which when triggered opens the shutter by moving the leaves to uncover the lens for the required time to make an exposure, then shuts. Simple leaf shutters have a single leaf, or two leaves, which pivot so as to allow light through to the lens when triggered. If two leaves are used they have curved edges to create a roughly circular aperture. They typically have only one shutter speed and are commonly found in basic cameras, including disposable cameras. Some have more than one speed. Shutters for newer digital cameras are a combination of electronic and mechanical timings. Some cameras employ a 100% electronic shutter, created by turning on and off the imaging sensor's signals. Digital cameras that can also take video implement this method for their video modes. For single-frame photography then either mechanical or mechanical and electronic methods are used. = Rotating shutter =  Hemispheric  The shutter plate consisted of a part of a sphere integrated to rotate behind the lens. It was a type of shutter found on the Photosphere and other cameras. =Diaphragm shutter= One diaphragm shutter opening over another in an Akarex camera Entries in Cassell's Cyclopedia of Photography, 1911. The terminology diaphragm shutter has since fallen from common use. A diaphragm or leaf shutter (as distinct from the simple leaf shutter above) consists of a number of thin blades which briefly uncover the camera aperture to make the exposure. The blades slide over each other in a way which creates a circular aperture which enlarges as quickly as possible to uncover the whole lens, stays open for the required time, then closes in the same way.Sidney Ray, Scientific Photography and Applied Imaging, Oxford: Focal Press, 1999 The larger the number of blades, the more accurately circular is the aperture. Flash synchronization is easily achieved with a pair of contacts that close when the shutter is fully open. Ideally the shutter opens instantaneously, remains open as long as required, and closes instantaneously. This is essentially the case at slower speeds, but as speeds approach their maximum the shutter is far from fully open for a significant part of the exposure time. Effectively the shutter acts as an additional aperture, and may, for example, cause vignetting or increase depth of field, undesirable if shallow focus is being used creatively. The term diaphragm shutter has also been used to describe an optical stop with a slit, near the focal plane of a moving-film high-speed camera.Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Macmillan, 1957 A few types and makers of leaf shutters became very well known. The early Compound shutter had a pneumatic mechanism, with a piston sliding against air resistance in a cylinder. They were quieter at slow speeds than clockwork, but potentially very inaccurate. More accurate clockwork mechanisms then replaced the airbrake, and the German Compur, and the later Synchro-Compur, became virtually the standard quality shutter. Later the Japanese Copal shutter was widely adopted in quality equipment. The German Prontor and Japanese Seikosha shutters were also widely used. Up and Down with Compur: The development and photo-historical meaning of leaf shutters, by Klaus-Eckard Riess, translated by Robert \\"The Professor\\" Stoddard gives a detailed history and technical description of leaf shutters. The company Compur Monitor was still in business , but made only gas detection systems. =Central shutter= A central shutter is not a type of shutter as such, but describes the position of the shutter: it is typically a leaf shutter (or simple leaf shutter), and located within the lens assembly where a relatively small opening allows light to cover the entire image. Leaf shutters can also be located behind, but near, the lens, allowing lens interchangeability. The alternative to a central or behind-the- lens shutter is a focal-plane shutter. Interchangeable-lens cameras with a central shutter within the lens body require that each lens has a shutter built into it. In practice most cameras with interchangeable lenses use a single focal plane shutter in the camera body for all lenses, while cameras with a fixed lens use a central shutter. Many medium-format and most large- format cameras, however, have interchangeable lenses each fitted with a central shutter. A few interchangeable-lens cameras have a behind-the-lens leaf shutter. Large-format press cameras often had a focal-plane shutter. Some had both a focal-plane shutter (for lens interchangeability) and a lens with central shutter (for flash synchronisation); one shutter would be locked open. Film cameras, but not digital cameras, with a central shutter and interchangeable lenses often have a secondary shutter or darkslide to cover the film and allow changing lens in mid-roll without fogging the film. The main advantages of central and behind-the-lens leaf shutters compared to a focal-plane shutter are: * Flash synchronization is possible at all speeds because the shutter opens fully, unlike a focal-plane shutter sliding a slit relatively slowly across the film for a short effective exposure. * Small size is possible as the shutter is placed where the bundle of rays is narrow, either inside or just behind the lens. * Many versions have no connection between the cocking mechanism and the film advance mechanism, making multiple exposures possible (this can be a disadvantage, as multiple exposures can be produced accidentally if the photographer forgets to advance the film). * Usually much quieter. * More realistic photographs in high speed panning-- lateral focal plane shutters compress or elongate the image in such cases. * Longer shutter life. Some disadvantages of the central shutter are: * For an interchangeable lens system, each lens has to have a shutter built into it. * All leaf shutter speeds are limited by the speed at which the leaves can move: typically 1/500th of a second for a high-specification diaphragm shutter and 1/125th of a second for a simple leaf shutter. * Some versions may have no connection between the cocking mechanism and the film advance mechanism, making accidental multiple exposures a common problem, although this is a feature of camera manufacture rather than the shutter itself. =Electronic shutter= Digital image sensors (both CMOS and CCD image sensors) can be constructed to give a shutter equivalent function by transferring many pixel cell charges at one time to a paired shaded double called frame transfer shutter. If the full-frame is transferred at one time, it is a global shutter. Often the shaded cells can independently be read, while the others are again collecting light.Electronic shuttering: Rolling vs Global shutter Motionvideoproducts Extremely fast shutter operation is possible as there are no moving parts or any serialized data transfers. Global shutter can also be used for videos as a replacement for rotary disc shutters. Image sensors without a shaded full-frame double must use serialized data transfer of illuminated pixels called rolling shutter. A rolling shutter scans the image in a line-by-line fashion, so that different lines are exposed at different instants, as in a mechanical focal-plane shutter, so that motion of either camera or subject will cause geometric distortions, such as skew or wobble.Shutter Operations for CCD and CMOS Image Sensors Kodak (PDF) Today, most digital cameras use combination of mechanical shutter and electronic shutter or mechanical shutter solely. Mechanical shutter can accommodate up to 1/16000 seconds (for example the Minolta Dynax/Maxxum/α-9 film camera had a maximum of 1/12000, a record in its era, and the later digital Nikon D1 series were capable of 1/16000), while electronic shutter can accommodate at least 1/32000 seconds, used for many superzoom cameras and currently many Fujifilm APS-C cameras (X-Pro2, X-T1, X100T and others). Shutter lag Shutter lag is the time between the shutter release being pressed and the exposure started. While this delay was insignificant on most film and some digital cameras, many digital cameras have significant delay, which can be a problem with fast- moving subjects as in sports and other action photography. Release lag of a bridge camera such as the 2010 Pentax X90 is a relatively short 1/50 s, or 21 milliseconds (ms). The Canon 50d dSLR is specified at 131 ms lag. In many cases autofocus (AF) lag is the root cause of shutter lag. Lower-cost cameras and low-light or low-contrast situations will make the effect more pronounced and it is in these cases that AF lag is more noticed. Most AF systems use contrast to determine focus; in situations where contrast is low, the speed at which the camera can determine the best focus can be quite noticeable. Since most modern cameras will not activate the shutter until autofocus is complete, the result is shutter lag. In these cases, the photographer can switch to manual focus to avoid the delay that is attributable to the AF function. Shutter cycle A shutter cycle is the process of the shutter opening, closing, and resetting to where it is ready to open again. The life-expectancy of a mechanical shutter is often expressed as a number of shutter cycles. Projector shutter In movie projection, the shutter admits light from the lamphouse to illuminate the film across to the projection screen. To avoid flicker, a double-bladed rotary disc shutter admits light two times per frame of film. There are also some models which are triple-bladed, and thus admit light three times per frame (see Persistence of vision). Shutters are also used simply to regulate pulses of light, with no film being used, as in a signal lamp.

He was arrested, later killed and cremated at the Dachau concentration camp. Early life Gerlich was born in Stettin, Pomerania, and grew up as the eldest of the three sons of wholesale and retail fishmonger Paul Gerlich and his wife Therese. In Autumn 1889, Gerlich was enrolled in the Marienstiftungymnasium (Our Lady's Grammar School) and graduated from his senior class there in 1901. In 1902 he began his studies at the University of Munich, and first majored in mathematics and natural sciences before switching to history. At the university, he was an active member of the Free Student Union (or sometimes translated as Free Student Association from the German word Freistudentenschaft). He wrote his doctoral dissertation \\"The Testament of Henry VI\\" and completed it in 1907. On 9 October 1920, he married Sophie Botzenhart, born Stempfle, in Munich. Career After completing his studies with a doctorate, Gerlich became an archivist. He also began to contribute political articles that were anti-socialist and national-conservative in the publications Süddeutsche Monatshefte, which was edited by Paul Nikolaus Cossmann, and Die Wirklichkeit (in 1917). In 1917, he also became active in the German Fatherland Party (Deutsche Vaterlandspartei) and after it was dissolved in the Anti-Bolshevist League (Antibolschewistische Liga) (1918/19). In 1919, he published the book Communism as the Theory of the Thousand Year Reich (Der Kommunismus als Lehre vom Tausendjährigen Reich), where Gerlich compared communism with the phenomenon of redemption religion. A whole chapter in the work is devoted to denouncing antisemitism, which had gained ground because of the leading positions of many Jews in the Revolution and founding of the Soviet Union and Bavarian Soviet Republic. During those years, Gerlich's political views became more liberal. In 1920, he was nominated as candidate to the Bavarian Landtag and German Reichstag for the left-liberal German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei). =Editor-in-chief of the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten= From 1920 to 1928 he was editor in chief of the Münchner Neueste Nachrichten (MNN), a predecessor to today's Süddeutsche Zeitung in that its circulation was one of the largest in southern Germany.Peter Langer: Paul Reusch und die Gleichschaltung der „Münchner Neuesten Nachrichten\\" 1933 in: Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte 2005, Heft 2, S. 203 (online) As editor, Gerlich opposed Nazism and Hitler's Nazi Party as \\"murderous\\". In the early 1920s, he had seen proof of Nazi tyranny already in Munich. Once a conservative nationalist, after the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch Gerlich decisively turned against Hitler and became one of his fiercest critics. Other critics of the Nazis at MNN were later arrested within days of Gerlich, such as: Fritz Buechner, who followed Gerlich as the editor of the MNN, Erwein Freiherr von Aretin, who was domestic editor at the MNN, and Cossmann, who wrote for the MNN, all of whom had steered the MNN to support a return of the monarchy. =Friendship with Therese Neumann= By 1927, he had befriended Therese Neumann, a Catholic mystic from Konnersreuth, Bavaria, who supported Gerlich's resistance activities. Initially, he wanted to expose her stigmatism as a fraud, but Gerlich came back a changed man and later converted from Calvinism to Catholicism in 1931. From that year until his death, his resistance became inspired by the social teachings of the Catholic Church. =The Straight Path newspaper= Gerlich returned in November 1929 to his job at the Bavarian National Archives. A circle of friends that had developed around Neumann gave rise to the idea of founding a weekly political newspaper to dispute the left and right political extremism in Germany. Supported by a wealthy patron, Prince Waldburg-Zeil, Gerlich was able to take over the weekly newspaper Sunday Illustrated (Der Illustrierte Sonntag), which was renamed The Straight Path (Der Gerade Weg) in 1932. In this newspaper, Gerlich opposed Communism, National Socialism and antisemitism. The dispute with the growing Nazi movement became the central focus of Gerlich and his later writing. At the end of 1932 the circulation of the weekly was over 40,000 readers. Gerlich once wrote \\"National Socialism means: Enmity with neighbouring nations, tyranny internally, civil war, world war, lies, hatred, fratricide and boundless want.\\"Der gerade Weg, 31 July 1932  Arrest and death at Dachau  After the Nazis seized power on 30 January 1933, Gerlich was arrested March 9, 1933 and held at the Dachau concentration camp, where he died on 30 June 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives. His death was officially announced days after his arrest, and the announcement was published in the international press at the time. He was cremated, ashes given to his wife. Fictional portrayals Gerlich was portrayed in the TV movie Hitler: The Rise of Evil by actor Matthew Modine. In the film, as he dictates a front-page article that warns of the danger that Hitler poses, Gerlich finishes with the words: \\"The worst thing we can do, the absolute worst, is to do nothing\\". This line is inspired by a quote often incorrectly attributed to Edmund Burke: \\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\\" References External links *Fritz Gerlich memorial website www.gerlich.com * Category:1883 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Writers from Szczecin Category:People from the Province of Pomerania Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Calvinism Category:German Roman Catholics Category:German people who died in Dachau concentration camp Category:German Fatherland Party politicians Category:German journalists Category:German male journalists Category:Executed German Resistance members Category:German Servants of God Category:Imprisoned journalists Category:Victims of the Night of the Long Knives Category:German people executed in Nazi concentration camps Category:German male writers Category:Murdered male writers Category:20th- century journalists ","title":"Fritz Gerlich"},{"id":"2145996","text":"240px A what-not is a piece of furniture derived from the French étagère, which was exceedingly popular in England in the first three-quarters of the 19th century.

Its original, pre-colonial usage related to reciprocal help given in neighbours' fields or freely-given agricultural labour as thanks for a benefit. In colonial times, between 1891 and 1962, it generally meant agricultural labour given in lieu of a cash rent, and generally without any payment, by a tenant on an estate owned by a European. Thangata was often exploited, and tenants could be forced to work on the owners' crops for four to six months annually when they could have cultivated their own crops. From the 1920s, the name thangata was extended to situations where tenants were given seeds to grow set quotas of designated crops instead of providing cash or labour. Both forms of thangata were abolished in 1962, but both before and after independence and up to the present, the term has been used for short- term rural casual work, often on tobacco estates, which is considered by workers to be exploitative. Thangata in Malawi =Origins and meaning= The term \\"thangata\\" has had several meanings in Malawi in the last 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use was very different from its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was \\"help\\" or \\"to assist\\", in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from those in their community who had benefited. This was also called thangata: although the term was first recorded with this meaning in 1921, the practice is believed to have existed for many centuries before then. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In the last two or three decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata. =In early colonial Nyasaland= Modern-day view of a tea plantation near Mulanje The 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, and local chiefs sought to gain European protection from their enemies by granting the settlers what they probably considered was only a right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured legal ownership of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could impose on tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In the early years of the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months' labour a year at this time. Before 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needs much labour, particularly for weeding and gathering, to achieve a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton, it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners' interpretations of their conditions. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year, for thangata labour rent and Hut tax. Much of this labour was demanded in the growing season, leaving tenants with little time to grow their own food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to remain. In this situation thangata came to mean forced labour. =Attempted reform and opposition= The Nyasaland High Court in 1903 exempted the original inhabitants of estates from thangata and gave them some security. Legislation allowing other tenants to pay rent rather than thangata, and to receive cash wages if they performed more than the required thangata was enacted in 1908, but not implemented. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, in December 1914, the Nyasaland government introduced a Nyasaland Defence Ordinance, requiring men to serve as porters in support of local armed forces. This service was equated with thangata, as those conscripted were forced to work on something that did not benefit them. The harshness of thangata, including the conscription of porters was at least one of the reasons underlying the 1915 uprising led by John Chilembwe. Following this revolt, a new attempt to abolish thangata in favour of cash rent was made, but it failed because of the political influence of the estate owners that opposed the measure. The thangata system was a bar to progress and impoverished people by limiting the amount of time they could work for themselves. There was no place for crafts or skills in thangata: ot reduced all tenants to unskilled manual labour, and was likened to a form of serfdom. Even after Chilembwe's revolt, the labour obligation on many estates was only slightly modified, sometimes amounting to six months for thangata and rent. When the Ormsby-Gore East African Commission visited Nyasaland in 1924, it was highly critical of the treatment of all Africans resident on private estates tenants supplying their labour, contrary to the exemption from thangata offered to those who were occupants when the original certificates of title certificates were granted. The commission suggested that, even though recent immigrants were not entitled to the same protection, they should be treated in the same way as the original residents and excused from thangata. However, local administrators were subject ti settler pressure and, although some abuses were curtailed, others such as equating a month of thangata to 30 days (or five weeks of six days' work), and requiring the wives of absent migrant workers, widows and single women to work in breach of custom, persisted. However, by 1918 most cotton, and by 1925 most tobacco, was not grown on estates by direct labour, but by smallholders on Crown lands. As the demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, the owners claimed that, as they had insufficient work for their tenants to meet their thangata obligations, they had become rent-free squatters. =In later colonial Nyasaland= Some smaller estates failed, but others were saved from collapse by a scheme first adopted by one large owner, The British Central Africa Company Ltd. Instead using of direct labour, it issued seeds to tenants so they could grow cotton and tobacco under supervision, and sell their crops to the planters at low prices. This system was formalised in legislation, the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, which modified thangata by allowing rents to be paid in cash, in a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The true value of the crop, usually tobacco, given in lieu of rent greatly exceeded the nominal cash rent, and some landlords refused to accept cash when it was offered. Estate landlords also benefited from restrictions on smallholders growing tobacco on Crown lands, who might otherwise have competed with the estate tenants. Although the estates now largely acted as brokers for their tenants' produce, and the name thangata, sometimes \\"tobacco thangata\\" after its commonest form was applied to rent in kind, the older form of labour thangata persisted on tea estates, and elsewhere if the owner wished to grow crops through direct labour. It was estimated that about 9% of Malawi's Africans lived on estates in 1911: in 1945, it was about 10%. In the latter year, the number of residents on estates was about 173,000 in 49,000 families.Nyasaland Superintendent of the Census, (1946). Report on the Census, 1945, Zomba, Government Printer, pp. 15-17. In the 1940s and early 1950s, there were tensions between estate owners and tenants over evictions and the tenants' wish to sell produce of their choice in local markets, not through the owner. The expansion of tea-planting led to a shortage of African labour, which became acute after 1945. The British Central Africa Company Ltd had formerly relied on labour tenants for most of its workforce, but in 1946 its local Manager complained that the company was unable to enforce unpopular thangata agreements or Sunday working although it had threatened many tenants with eviction. There was a further crisis in 1952–1953 when the British Central Africa Company tried to increase tenants' rents substantially, against the advice of the Nyasaland government. A number of tenants resisted the increase, and the company issued eviction notices to them. The tenants' resistance included clearing land for cultivation on the undeveloped parts of the company's estates and refusing to pay taxes or attend courts. Riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, and attempts to quell rioting led to eleven dead and seventy-two injured. The tensions were lessened by government purchases of the land of former estates for resettlement, so by 1962, the number of estate residents had been reduced to 9,000 families. In 1962, the 1928 Ordinance was replaced by a 1962 Africans on Private Estates Ordinance that granted tenants security of tenure and abolished all forms of thangata requiring labour or the production of amounts if designated crops, replacing them with cash rents.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, London, Pall Mall Press, pp. 128-30, 188. Although tenants had produced tobacco on many estates in the Southern Region, by 1935, 70% of the national tobacco crop was grown in the Central Region, which had fewer freehold estates. At first, this tobacco was grown by Africans on Crown land, later on leasehold land where the leases of former Crown land had been granted to Europeans. These leaseholders engaged African sharecroppers under contract to grow one annual tobacco crop at a time, the \\"visiting tenant\\" system. The \\"visiting tenant\\" system had some similarities to estate tenancies in the Shire Highlands (called thangata, whether the rent was satisfied in labour or produce), but it was distinct, as the visiting tenants had permanent homes away from the places where they grew their crop. Like estate tenants, visiting tenants were underpaid for their crop because they were forced to sell it to the landowner.J McCracken, (1984) Share-Cropping in Malawi: The Visiting Tenant System in the Central Province c. 1920-1968, in Malawi: An Alternative Pattern of Development, Edinburgh 1984, University of Edinburgh pp. 37-8, 41-2. Although it was originally distinct from thangata, in 1963 shortly before independence, Hastings Banda, who was Minister of Agriculture, fiercely attacked the visiting tenant system and equated it to the hated thangata. Despite this rhetoric, when thangata was abolished in 1962, a temporary exemption was given for visiting tenants in the Central Region. However, using the term thangata to apply to the visiting tenant system for political purposes both extended its meaning to a situation to which it had not previously applied and made its meaning less clear. =In post-colonial Malawi= By the late 1960s, politicians of the ruling Malawi Congress Party were involved in tobacco growing on the former European estates that the colonial government had bought, and which were sold or leased to the party elite after independence. Further elite-run estates were later created on what had previously been communal lands. By 1990, there were 675,000 registered estate tenants with little security, and another 580,000 \\"squatters\\" lived on surplus land with no security, who formed a pool of casual labour. Few tenants or squatters grew all their own food and most relied on casual paid labour or food-for-work arrangements on the estates to supplement what they could grow.L A H Msukwa, (1994) Food Policy and Production: Towards Increased Household Food Security, Zomba, University of Malawi Centre for Social Research pp 25-6. The preferred term for short-term rural casual work paid for in cash or in kind (usually food) is ganyu. The term \\"Ganyu\\" is said to derive from the Portuguese \\"ganho\\" (sometimes spelled \\"ganyao\\") meaning something gained or a bonus.N Webster and L Engberg- Pedersen, (2002). In the Name of the Poor: Contesting Political Space for Poverty Reduction, Zed Books. It originally denoted food or beer given as appreciation for neighbours when they worked on another's fields, then the work a poor person did for food or cash for more prosperous neighbour. Today tobacco estates are the largest employers of ganyu workers. These may stay for the growing season like visiting tenants, or travel in daily. Larger estates may pay the minimum cash wage; smaller estates usually only give food. These arrangements are sometimes called thangata, as in the 2007 documentary \\"Thangata: social bondage and big tobacco in Malawi\\".M. Whiteside, (1999). Ganyu Labour in Malawi and its implications for Livelihood Security Interventions pp. 6-7.\\"Thangata: social bondage and big tobacco in Malawi\\" Similar systems Of all the countries in Southern and Central Africa, Nyasaland was the most notorious for the duration of thangata and its importance to the colonial economy. Labour tenancy and sharecropping continued to exist in other less developed parts of Southern and Central Africa in the 20th century, but without the same social and political impact as in Nyasaland. In much of South Africa and Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, the growth of the money economy led rapidly to waged employment rather than labour in lieu of rent, and in North-Eastern Rhodesia estate agriculture was less dominant and land reasonably plentiful. In early Natal, the shortage of capital caused landowners to extract rent from African tenants in the forms of produce or labour, and this applied in Zululand until the early 20th century. However, in central Natal, employment for wages took over in the last third of the 19th century. African tenant farmers on European-owned estates in Matabeleland in the early colonial period could either pay rent or provide labour in lieu of rent, but after 1910, it was more usual for these estates to employ Africans for wages. The system that is probably closest to thangata is the institution that was called ubureetwa in Rwanda. Although there were few European landowners, the traditional leaders who controlled access land were from the dominant Tutsi group. After the Europeans occupation, they were able to manipulate what had previously been freely-given labour into an unpaid agricultural labour obligation. As Rwanda had a mobile population, chiefs could allocate land to clients outside the community that had a traditional claim to use the land, in a clear parallel to the Mozambican migrants on Nyasaland estates. These Rwandan incomers were prepared to agree to accept a heavy burden of labour for access to land.The colonial administration in Rwanda gave a legal status to ubureetwa and, up to the 1950s, resisted abolishing it or commuting it to cash. In the Congo Free State, forced labour, amounting to virtual slavery, was widely used by the government on public works and to compel Africans to gather ivory or wild rubber. Although forced labour in the Belgian Congo was abolished in theory in 1908, from 1917 the government a system of forced cultivation of cotton, coffee and rice began to be imposed on the peasant population, who were required to use their own land for one or more if these designated crops. On Belgian-owned estates, a Labour Code introduced in 1922 allowed employers to physically discipline their workers, so supposedly free labour was turned into a system of forced labour. However, neither the peasants nor estate workers were tenants, so the system was rather different from thangata.

He is the younger brother of Tony Conigliaro; Billy and Tony were Red Sox teammates in 1969 and 1970. Career Conigliaro was born in Revere, Massachusetts, and played high school baseball in nearby Swampscott. In the 1965 Major League Baseball draft—the first-ever MLB draft—Conigliaro was selected by the Boston Red Sox with the fifth overall pick, becoming the first player ever drafted by the team. Conigliaro played in the minor leagues during the 1965 to 1968 seasons, then made his MLB debut with Boston in April 1969. Conigliaro showed great promise as a hitter in his years in Boston, with 16 doubles and 18 home runs in 1970, and 26 doubles and 11 home runs in 1971. He finished 8th in the American League in doubles in 1971, his most productive year in the majors. In 1970, he was 10th in American League in being hit by pitches, with seven. His most memorable game may have been on July 4, 1970, when both Billy and his brother Tony homered against the Cleveland Indians. Conigliaro was part of a ten-player blockbuster that sent him, George Scott, Jim Lonborg, Ken Brett, Joe Lahoud and Don Pavletich from the Red Sox to the Milwaukee Brewers for Tommy Harper, Marty Pattin, Lew Krausse and minor-league outfielder Pat Skrable on October 10, 1971.\\"Red Sox, Brewers in 10‐Player Deal,\\" United Press International (UPI), Sunday, October 10, 1971. Retrieved April 13, 2020 Billy, who idolized his older brother Tony, had been highly critical of the Red Sox for trading his brother to the California Angels, especially after Tony's remarkable 36 home runs during the 1970 season after his famous \\"beaning\\" incident in 1967. Unhappy in Milwaukee, Conigliaro announced his retirement from baseball in the middle of the 1972 season. He came back to baseball in 1973 as a part-time player with the eventual World Champion Oakland Athletics, making brief appearances in that season's American League Championship Series and the World Series. Once again, Billy became disgruntled with ownership—this time in Oakland—and retired at the conclusion of that season. He attempted a comeback with Oakland several years later, but ultimately retired for good after being assigned to their Triple-A affiliate on what was to be a \\"temporary\\" basis.

Starting operating in the North Sea from 1972, the company expanded to operate in most marine areas open for explorations, until Geco was incorporated into Geco- Prakla, with Schlumberger Limited as the solely owner from 1993. History The company started as Geoteam-Computas Ltd. A.S on December 13, 1972. The name was shortly afterwards changed to Geophysical Company of Norway, most commonly referred to as Geco. Anders Farestveit was the founder and the first CEO. The main focus was marine seismic surveys, including developing and equipping seismic vessels and conducting seismic surveys on customer requests. Geco was merged with the competing Norwegian geophysical company at that time, Statex (owned by Statoil and Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk) effective from January 1, 1978. Ownership after the merger was shared between Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk and Det Norske Veritas. Geco retained its identity and name, but extended its service portfolio and global market share from 1978. Besides seismic surveys, the company offered data processing services and interpretation services. The company was spending its earnings in the area of technology research and development. They succeeded in offering a first commercial available 3D seismic interpretation workstation, \\"Charisma\\" software, from 1983. Development of a first digital streamer cable, named \\"Nessie\\", was completed and in operation from 1984. The company enjoyed strong expansion until 1985, when there was a global crisis in the oil industry. In the summer of 1986 Schlumberger Limited purchased first 50%, then in 1988 the entire company. This brought about a merger with Merlin Geophysical (Seismic Profilers), who had been purchased by Schlumberger a year earlier. Mergers with other geophysical companies followed, including Delft Geophysical, Prakla-Seismos (founded in 1963 by merger of Seismos GmbH (founded 1921) and Gesellschaft für Praktische Lagerstättenforschung (Prakla) GmbH (founded 1937)) and Seismograph Services Ltd (owned at the time by Ratheon and based in Holwood Park, Keston, Kent, UK). Following the merger with Prakla-Seismos in 1993, the company was renamed Geco-Prakla. In 2001, Geco-Prakla was joined with the Western Geophysical division of Baker Hughes in a joint venture named WesternGeco. Schlumberger retained 70% ownership in the venture; Baker Hughes owned the remaining 30%. In April 2006 Schlumberger acquired the 30% interest from Baker Hughes for $2.4 billion. Now, this company doesn't exist anymore. All of its assets, employees, and legal identities belong to Schlumberger. References * På dypt vann - Et høyteknologisk eventyr. Halvor Kr. Bjerke, 1989.

Margaret L. Anderson argues that he was \\"Imperial Germany's greatest parliamentarian\\" and bears comparison with Irishmen Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell \\"in his handling of party machinery and his relation to the masses.\\" He entered politics during the revolutionary years of 1848 and 1849 in the Protestant Kingdom of Hanover, where his legal and political skills overcame the handicap of near blindness and being in an unpopular minority. He supported Hanoverian independence (\\"particularism\\") and was loyal to monarchism. He was not a Liberal but they admired his opposition to the king's reactionary policies and his strong support for an independent judiciary and the rights of the accused. He served in 1851 and 1862 as minister of justice. When Prussia absorbed Hanover and then set up the German Empire in 1871, Windthorst dealt with the new state of affairs and became a leader of the all-Catholic Centre Party. It won over 80% of the Catholic vote in a new nation that was one-third Catholic. He opposed Bismarck's harassment of minorities such as Catholics, Hanoverian Guelphs, Poles, Danes, and Alsatians. He argued for natural law as the basis of political rights. He perfected the arts of opposition, forming alliances that could win majorities. The Centre party became what Anderson calls \\"a liberal party manque.\\" That is, it kept its distance from the anti-Catholic National Liberal Party but championed the rights of minorities, the powers of parliament, and the rule of law against Bismarck's moves. In the 1870s, he was a vigorous enemy of the Bismarck's Kulturkampf, which persecuted the Catholic Church in Prussia in an effort to destroy papal control. Bismarck eventually lost, but it was Pope Leo XIII who negotiated with Bismarck in the end, cutting out Windthorst. Biography Windthorst was born at Kaldenhof manor in the present-day municipality of Ostercappeln, in the lands of the former Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück, which had been secularised to the Electorate of Hanover under the Protestant Welf dynasty in 1803. The growth-restricted boy was raised in a Roman Catholic family, which for some generations had held important posts in the bishopric's civil service. Windthorst became a half-orphan at the age of ten, when his father died in 1822. He was educated at the Gymnasium Carolinum, an endowed school at Osnabrück which he left with excellent Abitur exams, and from 1830 studied law at the universities of Göttingen and Heidelberg. Influenced by the rise of liberalism during the Vormärz era and the 1832 Hambach Festival as well as by the Catholic theologian Georg Hermes, Windthorst tried to bring his Catholic confession in accordance with the ideals of liberty, civil rights and national unity. Memorial at Kaldenhof In 1836, Windthorst settled down as an advocate in Osnabrück: his abilities soon procured him a considerable practice, and he was appointed president of the Catholic consistory in 1842. Though socially disadvantaged, the Catholics had remained loyal to the ruling House of Hanover during the 1837 insurrection of the Göttingen Seven against King Ernest Augustus, and in 1848 Windthorst received an appointment at the supreme court of appeal (Oberappellationsgericht) for the Kingdom of Hanover at Celle. The March Revolution opened for him—as for so many of his contemporaries—the way to public life and though he failed to gain a mandate for the Frankfurt Assembly, he was elected representative for his native district in the second chamber of the reformed Hanoverian parliament in 1849. He belonged to what was called the Greater German party, and opposed the project of reconstituting Germany under the leadership of the Kingdom of Prussia. He defended the government against the liberal and democratic opposition; and, at this time, he began his struggle against the secularization of schools, which continued throughout his life. In 1851, he was elected president of the chamber and, in the same year, minister of justice, the first Catholic who had held so high an office in Hanover. As minister, he carried through an important judicial reform—which had been prepared by his predecessor—but had to retire from office because he was opposed to the reactionary measures for restoring the influence and privileges of the nobility. Though he was always an enemy to liberalism, his natural independence of character prevented him from acquiescing in the reactionary measures of the king. In 1862, he again was appointed minister, but with others of his colleagues, he resigned when the king refused his assent to a measure for extending the franchise. Windthorst took no part in the critical Austro-Prussian War; contrary to the opinion of many of his friends, after the annexation of Hanover by Prussia, he accepted the fait accompli, took the oath of allegiance, and was elected a member both of the Prussian parliament and of the North German diet. At Berlin, he found a wider field for his abilities. He acted as representative of his exiled king in the negotiations with the Prussian government concerning his private property, and opposed the sequestration, and for the first time was placed in a position of hostility to Otto von Bismarck. He was recognized as the leader of the Hanoverians and of all those above who opposed the revolution. He took a leading part in the formation of the party of the Center in 1870–1871, but he did not become a member of it, for he feared that his reputation as a follower of the king of Hanover would injure the party; that is, until the leaders formally requested that he join them. Memorial at the Meppen Windthorst school After the death of Hermann von Mallinckrodt (1821-1874) in 1874, Windthorst became leader of the party and maintained that position until his death. It was chiefly owing to his skill and courage as a parliamentary debater and his tact as a leader, that the party held its own and constantly increased in numbers during the great struggle with the Prussian government. He was especially exposed to the attacks of Bismarck, who attempted, personally, to discredit him and to separate him from the rest of the party. And, he was by far the ablest and most dangerous critic of Bismarck's policy. The change of policy in 1879 led to a great alteration in his position: he was reconciled to Bismarck and even sometimes attended receptions at Bismarck's house. Never, however, was his position so difficult as during the negotiations which led to a repeal of the May laws. On the background of rising anti-Semitism, he stood up for the Jews and enforced the expulsion of anti-Semitic members from the Center Party. In 1887, Bismarck appealed to the Pope to use his authority to order the Center to support the military proposals of the government. Windthorst took the responsibility of keeping the papal instructions secret from the rest of his party and of disobeying the instructions. In a great meeting at Cologne in March 1887, he defended and justified his action, and claimed for the Center full independence of action in all purely political questions. In the social reform, he supported Bismarck, and as the undisputed leader of the largest party in the Reichstag, he was able to exercise influence over the action of the government after Bismarck's retirement. His relations with the emperor William II became very cordial, and in 1891 he achieved a great parliamentary triumph by defeating the School bill and compelling Gossler to resign. Death and legacy Rebuilt Marienkirche, Hanover Windthorst died of pneumonia, on 14 March 1891, in Berlin. Two days before, Emperor Wilhelm II paid him a visit at his deathbed. He was buried in the Marienkirche in Hannover, which had been erected from the money subscribed as a testimonial to him. The church was destroyed by bombing raids which occurred from July 1943-March 1945 during the Second World War, though his grave was spared, and reconstructed in 1953/4. His funeral was a most remarkable display of public esteem, in which nearly all the ruling princes of Germany joined, and was a striking sign of the position to which, after twenty years of incessant struggle, he had raised his party. According to historian Golo Mann, Windthorst was one of the greatest of German parliamentary leaders: no one equaled him in his readiness as a debater—his defective eyesight compelling him to depend entirely upon his memory. It was his misfortune that nearly all his life was spent in opposition, and he had no opportunity of showing his abilities as an administrator. He enjoyed unbounded popularity and confidence among the German Catholics, but he was in no way an ecclesiastic: he was at first opposed to the Vatican decrees of 1870, but quickly accepted them after they had been proclaimed. He was a very agreeable companion and a thorough man of the world, singularly free from arrogance and pomposity—owing to his small stature, he was often known as \\"die kleine Excellenz\\". Windthorst married Juliane (Julie) Sybille Caroline Engelen (12/09/1805 Oedingberge26/01/1898, Hanover) on May 29, 1839: of his four living children, three died before him. They were Maria (26/09/18412/02/1933), Anna (12/04/184319/03/1867), Julius (15/11/184418/11/1872), and Eduard (7/07/184624/04/1860).

It has about 6,000 inhabitants. It is the centre of the rural Hustopečsko region, known for fruit and wine growing. Geography The town is situated in the historic Moravia region, within the southern foothills of the Ždánice Forest range. The town centre is located about northwest of the district capital Břeclav. In the northeast, the D2 motorway runs from Brno to the border with Slovakia. History Hustopeče was first mentioned in a 1247 deed, at the time when the Czech Přemyslid dynasty ruled the Margraviate of Moravia. From the 11th century onwards, the area around Mikulov and Znojmo had been settled by German colonists in the course of the Ostsiedlung movement, mainly descending from the Austrian lands in the southwest. Local nobles and feudal lords were followers of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. When in 1306 the male line of the Přemyslids became extinct, Hustopeče passed to Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia; she granted the estates to the Cistercian nuns in Brno. In 1572 Emperor Maximilian II officially vested Hustopeče with town privileges. During the 16th century, it developed as an important trade centre on the route from Prague to Hungary. It also became a centre of radical Anabaptists and the Hutterite movement. Upon the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburg rulers enacted several Counter-Reformation measures to enforce the return of the citizens to the Catholic faith. The town was repeatedly looted and burned during the Thirty Years' War; in 1643 and 1645, it was devastated by Swedish troops under Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson. During the Great Turkish War and the 1683 Battle of Vienna, Hustopeče was occupied by Ottoman forces. Hustopeče in 1909 In 1756 the Piarists established a first gymnasium here. On 18 July 1894, Hustopeče received access to a Lokalbahn branch line to Šakvice and the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway from Vienna to Prague. Until 1918, Auspitz – HustopečeKlein types Hustopec but this is probably an error. (Auspitz until the mid-19th century) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austrian side after the Compromise of 1867), in the district with the same name, one of the 34 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Cisleithanian Margraviate of Moravia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den österreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 According to a 1910 census, most of its inhabitants were ethnic Germans. After World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, large parts of the South Moravian region were claimed by the newly established Republic of German-Austria; nevertheless, according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain, Hustopeče and it surroundings passed the First Czechoslovak Republic. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, it was occupied by Nazi Germany and incorporated into Reichsgau Niederdonau as one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. After World War II, Hustopeče returned to Czechoslovakia and the remaining German- speaking population was expelled according to the Beneš decrees. Sights St. Wenceslaus Church The town skyline was dominated by the Gothic parish church dedicated to Saint Wenceslaus and Agnes of Bohemia, built in the late 12th century. Though renovated several times, its high steeple collapsed in 1961, which damaged the church's structure greatly. One year later, the Communist government ordered the building to be torn down. After the Velvet Revolution, a new futuristic church was built on the site of the old one between 1990 and 1994, and was designed by L. Kolka. The new St. Wenceslaus' church has a high steeple ( including its cross). Sport Each year in late January, Hustopeče is host to the world's best high jumpers competing in the Moravia High Jump Tour.

Rasmus B. Anderson transl. (1897) Chicago: Scott, Foresman & Co. (1901). found in the Flateyjarbók manuscript,Lindow (2002:280-281). which was written and compiled by two Christian priests, Jon Thordson and Magnus Thorhalson,Rasmus B. Anderson, Introduction to the Flatey Book. Norræna Society, London (1908). \\"The priest Jon Thordson wrote the story of Erik Vidforle and both the Olaf Sagas; but the priest Magnus Thorhalson wrote what follows and also what goes before, and revised the whole, thus dedicating the work: \\"May God Almighty and the Virgin Mary bless both the one that wrote and the one that dictated!\\" in the late 14th century. The narrative begins 24 years after the death of Fróði, and takes place in the 9th and the 10th centuries. It is a composite tale containing a story of how Freyja acquired a necklace from the Dwarves, how that led to a bloody war, and how Olaf Tryggvason brought peace to the land. The story parallels elements of earlier stories such as Heimskringla (euhemerization of gods), parts of the poem Lokasenna (Loki's accusation of Gefjun sleeping with a boy for a necklace), parts of the Húsdrápa poem (Loki stealing the necklace Brísingamen), and the eternal battle Hjaðningavíg (various earlier sources). In the end of the story, the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that was traditionally to endure until Ragnarök. The story has been described as \\"post- classical\\" due to elements such as the descriptor of Loki as \\"cunning\\" without apparent irony, featuring Freyja and Loki as court retainers, and the open representation of Freyja's sexuality that it features. 19th century scholar Benjamin Thorpe referred to Freyja's role in the tale as \\"rather awkward\\".Thorpe (1866:63). Synopsis =Freyja and the Dwarves= Freyja in the Dwarfs' Cave, illustration by Louis Huard The tale begins in Asia, and a land called Asialand, saying that Odin was the King there; and relates that Freyja was the daughter of Njord and Odin's concubine, whom Odin loved very much. Then it introduces four dwarves named Álfrigg, Dvalinn (Dwalin), Berlingr and Grérr and since they were dwarves they were skilled craftsmen and lived in a large stone. But in those days, they mingled more with people than they do today. One day, Freyja saw that the Dwarves were making a beautiful collar and she offered them both gold and silver in exchange for it. But, the Dwarves would only sell it to her in exchange for one night each with her. Freyja agreed and after four nights with the Dwarves, she returned with the beautiful collar. =Loki= Loki is then introduced and reveals that he was the son of Fárbauti and his wife Laufey, who was called needle because she was so slender. Loki became very popular with Odin because of his gift for providing information. When Loki told Odin of Freyja's collar, Odin asked him to fetch the collar or never to return, so Loki transformed himself into a fly and found a way into Freyja's bower. When he found her, he saw that she had the collar on and lay on her back. He turned into a flea and bit her whereupon she turned so he could unlock the collar and steal it. Then he returned to Odin and gave him the collar. When Freyja woke up, she learned that Odin had got hold of the collar and asked to have it back. Odin said that he knew how she had acquired the collar and that he would only let her have it back on the condition that she enchanted two kings and twenty subordinate kings so that they would fight each other every night, die and rise again, until a Christian lord entered the battle and defeated them all. Freyja promised that so would be done and got the collar back. =King Erling and Sörli= King Erlingr was a king of Oppland and he had a queen and the sons Sörli and Erlendr. Sörli and Erlendr went pillaging as Vikings as soon as their age permitted and one day they began to fight Sindri Sveigisson, the grandson of Haki at Elfarsker (the islands outside modern Gothenburg ). The battle ended with the death of both Sindri and Erlendr, after which Sörli sailed into the Baltic sea (Eystra salt) to harry. =Sörli kills king Halfdan= The king of Denmark was called Halfdan and he resided in Roskilde (Hróiskelda) and was married to Hvedna the old. Their sons were named Högni and Hakon and they were great warriors. When Sörli arrived in Denmark he saw a great longship, which king Halfdan was about to board in order to attend a royal meeting. Sörli decided to kill the king and appropriate the great ship, in spite of his marshal Sævar's warnings about Högni and Hakon. Halfdan fought heroically, but was slain and Sörli sailed away with the dragon ship. Sörli later learnt that Högni had returned from an expedition and was moored at Odense, and so he sailed to meet Högni and tell him about his father's demise. He wanted to offer Högni and Hakon recompensation and to become foster-brethren, but the two brothers would have none of it. After a battle in which Hakon, Sævar and Erlingr died, and finally Sörli fell. However, Högni healed Sörli and agreed to enter sworn brotherhood. After some time Sörli died in the East, an event for which there is a poem . When Högni learnt of this he went east, won many victories and finally became king there with twenty kings as paying vassals. He was famous from the land of the Finns to Paris. =Hedinn and Högni= In Serkland, there was a king named Hjarandi, who had a son named Hedinn. This son was a great sea-king and he pillaged all over the Mediterranean until twenty kings paid tribute to him. One day he met a beautiful woman sitting on a chair who called herself Göndul. She told him of Högni, and agitated him to test his strength against the northerner. Hedinn took three hundred men, and sailed both a summer and a winter until he arrived in Denmark in spring. When the two men met they tested each other's strength and entered sworn brotherhood. As Hedinn was unmarried, Högni betrothed him to his daughter Hildr, his only child. Hildr's mother was Hervor, the daughter of Hjörvard who was the son of of the Hervarar saga. Hedinn soon met Göndul again, who asked him about what had happened since the last time. She gave him a magic potion and told him to crush Högni's wife with the prow of his ship and to kidnap Hildr. He did so, and Göndul then gave him a new horn to drink, and he fell asleep. In his dream, he heard Göndul reveal that she was a valkyrie and that she put him, Högni and their men under spells according to the wishes of Odin. Högni hunted Hedinn and found him on an island named Hoy. Hedinn offered to give everything back to Högni and to sail away to Serkland and never come back. Högni, however, declared that nothing could atone the betrayal that Hedinn had committed. The two armies started to fight and even though they cut each other all over, they stood still fighting and fighting for 143 years, so strong were the spells of Göndul, until Olaf Tryggvason arrived at the island. =Deliverance= Olaf and his crew grew concerned about the number of men who went to the island but never came back. Ivar Gleam-bright took his sword that he had got from Thorstein, the son of Iron-shield, the former owner, and went into the island. There he met a big and bloodied man of sorrowful contenance. It was Hedinn who told Ivar of the curse. Hedinn said that in order to be delivered from the curse, a Christian army had to fight with them, and every man who was slain by a Christian would remain dead. However, Hedinn advised Ivar not to look Högni in the face because Högni wore the Horror helmet (ægishjálmr). Instead Hedinn would fight Högni and Ivar would kill Högni from the behind. Ivar did so, and killed all the men until only Hedinn was left and was slain. Ivar went to see Hildr, but she had vanished. Ivar went to see the king in the morning and told everybody of the event. The king and the men followed him to the battle ground, but everything had vanished and there was nothing to be seen. Only the blood on Ivar's sword testified to what had taken place.

He filled those roles on NBC's The Today Show from January 15, 1973, after starting part-time in 1970, until his retirement on November 11, 2010. He is known for his frequent use of puns, his oversized handlebar moustache and fuzzy hair, and for wearing colorful bowties. Early life and education According to his official MSNBC bio, > Shalit was born in a New York hospital on March 25, 1926, and eight days > later, arrived in Newark, New Jersey, in company of his mother. In 1932, he > accompanied his family when they moved to Morristown, New Jersey.

Born to Jewish parents, Shalit attended Morristown High School, where he wrote a humor column for the school newspaper.Morristown at a glance , Gannett Company. Accessed January 27, 2008. \\"Poet Joyce Kilmer once taught at Morristown High School, and film critic Gene Shalit got his start writing a humor column, 'The Korn Krib,' for the high school newspaper.\\" Shalit wrote for The Daily Illini for six years at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (1943–1949). Career Shalit, according to a New York Times Magazine interview of Dick Clark, was Clark's press agent in the early 1960s. Shalit reportedly \\"stopped representing\\" Clark during a Congressional investigation of payola. Clark never spoke to Shalit again, and referred to him as a \\"jellyfish\\", an informal term for \\"a person without strong resolve or stamina\\". Shalit has been involved in reviewing the arts since 1967 and has written for such publications as Look magazine, Ladies' Home Journal (for 12 years), Cosmopolitan, TV Guide, Seventeen, Glamour, McCall's, and The New York Times. From 1970 to 1982 he had a daily essay on NBC Radio \\"Man About Anything\\", that was carried on more stations than any other NBC network radio feature. In 1986, Shalit hosted a videocassette and laserdisc collection from MCA Home Video, Gene Shalit's Critic's Choice Video. Four images (five on the laserdisc covers) of Shalit appeared in a filmstrip on the front of the box with his reviews on the back. Titles included Touch of Evil, Destry Rides Again, Double Indemnity and The Ipcress File. Shalit announced that he would leave The Today Show after 40 years, effective November 11, 2010. Of his decision, he was quoted as saying: \\"It's enough already\\". He has largely been reclusive since his retirement, only appearing once for Willard Scott's retirement in 2015. =Brokeback Mountain review controversy= Shalit was criticized by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for his review of Brokeback Mountain in which he referred to Jake Gyllenhaal's character as a \\"sexual predator\\": GLAAD said Shalit's \\"baseless branding of Jack as a 'sexual predator' merely because he is romantically interested in someone of the same sex is defamatory, ignorant, and irresponsible\\" and that he \\"used the occasion to promote defamatory antigay prejudice to a national audience.\\" His gay son, Peter Shalit, wrote a letter to GLAAD defending his father and said GLAAD had defamed him by \\"falsely accusing him of a repellent form of bigotry.\\" Written works Shalit has written and edited various books.  * Personal life Shalit married Nancy Lewis. For much of his career, he lived in Leonia, New Jersey. Shalit's children include the artist and entrepreneur Willa Shalit. Another child is Peter Shalit, a physician and recognized authority on gay men's health and living with HIV. His daughter Emily died of ovarian cancer in 2012.  Cameo appearances and popular culture  Shalit guest-starred as the voice, and was portrayed in the form, of a fish food critic named \\"Gene Scallop\\" in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"The Krusty Sponge\\". He has been parodied in several episodes of Family Guy in cutaway gags. In \\"Brian Sings and Swings\\", Shalit mugs Peter in a cutaway and makes threats using several movie title puns (\\"Don't Panic Room ... I'm not going to William Hurt you. I only want your Tango & Cash. So just Pay it Forward and we'll all be Happy Gilmore!\\"), which only serves to confuse Peter. In \\"The Book of Joe\\", Peter haunts Shalit and his fictional wife Joanne (who is identical to Shalit himself with a large moustache) by pretending to be the ghost of Roger Ebert. In another episode, Peter obtains the power of transformation and while in the form of Britney Spears he kisses Justin Timberlake and then turns into Shalit, exclaiming to a horrified Timberlake, \\"I'm Gene Shalit now! BYE!\\". In \\"Big Man on Hippocampus\\", Peter reads aloud a review that was supposedly written by Shalit. Another reference is when Peter is being told that all white people look alike, in reply a cutout of Gene Shalit's face is placed over Peter's as he asks \\"We all look alike do we!?\\" Shalit also voiced his own likeness in three episodes of the animated series The Critic. A Muppet character based on him appeared in The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence (1975).

Career  {align=right  } Snyder moved to New York in 1904 after working in Chicago plugging musical compositions. In 1907, Snyder had his first musical composition published and the following year set up his own music publishing business in New York City. He gave Irving Berlin his first break in 1909 when he hired him as a staff writer for his company and the two eventually became business partners. In 1914, Ted Snyder became one of the founding members of ASCAP. Snyder's growing name as a top-line composer led to his compositions being used in stage plays with the first to make it to Broadway in 1908. Following his teaming up with Irving Berlin, the two were hired to perform and sing their music in the 1910 musical Up and Down Broadway. Snyder would become widely known to a later generation through hits such as 1921's \\"The Sheik of Araby\\" recorded by several artists including Duke Ellington (in 1932Duke Ellington recording sessions, 1930–1934 ), Benny Goodman (in 1937), and The Beatles (in 1962, Decca Audition). The most notable of Snyder's works is \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\" written in 1923 in collaboration with Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\" became a No.1 hit on the UK Singles Chart for Connie Francis in 1958 and went to No. 4 on the American Billboard charts. In 2000, it was named one of the Songs of the Century by the Recording Industry Association of America.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1917 to 1936, and again from 1941 to 1945. Boivin, a Franco-Manitoban and the son of farmer Wilfred Boivin, was first elected to the Manitoba legislature for the constituency of Iberville in a by-election held on November 1, 1917. Boivin initially served as a member of the Conservative Party, which was the dominant party among Manitoba's francophone community at the time. Many Franco-Manitobans shifted away from the Conservative Party after the end of World War I. Boivin was returned as an independent candidate in the 1920 provincial election, and subsequently affiliated himself with the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM). He was easily re-elected as a UFM candidate in the 1922 provincial election. The UFM won the 1922 election, and formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Boivin served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's administration, and was re-elected as a pro-government independent candidate in the elections of 1927 and 1932. Prior to the 1932 election, the Progressive Party of Manitoba joined with the Manitoba Liberal Party to form a \\"Liberal- Progressive\\" alliance. This alliance was made permanent after the election, though it did not always prevent Liberals and Progressives from running against one another in specific constituencies. Boivin was challenged by a pro-government Liberal named John Lamont in the 1936 election, and lost by 132 votes. Again campaigning as a pro-government independent candidate, Boivin challenged Lamont in the 1941 provincial election and won without difficulty. Though he still supported the Liberal-Progressive government, Boivin sometimes sided with the small opposition caucus in legislative debates after 1941. He retired from the assembly in 1945.

U.S. Army troops in Europe, spring 1945, with artillery shells labeled as \\"Easter eggs for Hitler\\". Field artillery is a category of mobile artillery used to support armies in the field. These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, short range, long range, and extremely long range target engagement. Until the early 20th century, field artillery were also known as foot artillery, for while the guns were pulled by beasts of burden (often horses), the gun crews would usually march on foot, thus providing fire support mainly to the infantry. This was in contrast to horse artillery, whose emphasis on speed while supporting cavalry units necessitated lighter guns and crews riding on horseback. Whereas horse artillery has been superseded by self-propelled artillery, field artillery has survived to this day both in name and mission, albeit with motor vehicles towing the guns, carrying the crews and transporting the ammunition. Modern artillery has also advanced to rapidly deployable wheeled and tracked vehicles and precision delivered munitions capable of striking targets at ranges between 15 and 300 kilometers. Types *Field guns – capable of long range fire *Gun howitzers – capable of high or low angle fire with a long barrel *Howitzers – capable of high angle fire *Infantry support guns – directly support infantry units (mostly obsolete) *Gun mortars – breech-loaded mortars capable of high or low angle fire. *Mortars – weapons that fire projectiles at an angle of over 45 degrees to the horizontal, modern versions being lightweight with fin- stabilized explosive ammunition *Mountain guns – lightweight weapons that can be moved through difficult terrain (mostly obsolete) *Multiple rocket launchers – mobile rocket artillery launchers History =Early modern era = An illustration of a bronze \\"thousand ball thunder cannon\\" from the 14th- century Ming Dynasty book Huolongjing. The cannon is an early example of pre- modern mobile battlefield artillery. American artillery crew during the Revolutionary War. Early artillery was unsuited to the battlefield, as the extremely massive pieces could not be moved except in areas that were already controlled by the combatant. Thus, their role was limited to such functions as breaking sieges.A History of Warfare. Keegan, John, Vintage 1993 Following the beginning of the gunpowder era, the first field artillery came into being as metallurgy allowed thinner cannon barrels to withstand the explosive forces without bursting. However, there was still a serious risk of the constant changes of the battlefield conspiring to leave behind slow-moving artillery units – either on the advance, or more dangerously, in retreat. Artillery units were particularly vulnerable to assault by light cavalry, which were frequently used in this role. Only with a number of further inventions (such as the limber, hitched to the trail of a wheeled artillery piece equipped with trunnions), did the concept of field artillery really take off.\\\\ The medieval Ming dynasty Chinese invented mobile battlefield artillery during the early part of the fourteenth century at the time when gunpowder and the primordial cannon were first being adopted in the West. One of the earliest documented uses of field artillery is found in the 14th-century Ming Dynasty treatise Huolongjing. The text describes a Chinese cannon called a \\"thousand ball thunder cannon\\", manufactured of bronze and fastened with wheels. The book also describes another mobile form of artillery called a \\"barbarian attacking cannon\\" consisting of a cannon attached to a two-wheel carriage. = 20th century = Before field artillery batteries generally fired directly at visible targets measured in distances of meters and yards. Today, modern field batteries measure targets in kilometers and miles and often do not directly engage the enemy with observed direct fire. The hundredfold increase in the range of artillery guns in the 20th century has been the result of development of rifled cannons, improvements in propellants, better communications between observer and gunner, and technical improvements in gunnery computational abilities. Most field artillery situations require indirect fire due to weather, terrain, night-time conditions, distance, or other obstacles. These gunners can also rely upon a trained artillery observer, also called a forward observer, who sees the target and relays the coordinates of the target to their fire direction center, which in turn translates those coordinates into: a left-right aiming direction; an elevation angle; a calculated number of bags of propellant; and finally a fuze with a determined waiting time before exploding (if necessary) to be set, which is then mated to the artillery projectile now ready to be fired.  Field artillery team  Modern field artillery (i.e. post-World War I) has three distinct sections: All batteries have a Fire Support Man (Forward Observer), Fire Direction Control (FDC), and Cannoners (Gunner). The FOs are forward with the infantry (in support role) where they can see the targets and Call For Fire (CFF) upon them. They call the FDC on the radio and transmit a request for fire in the format of CFF. The FDC calculates the CFF and send a deflection and elevation to the gun line. The gun line cranks the specified elevation and deflection on the howitzers, punch the artillery shell followed by the bag (powder). Depending on the CFF, the gunline will fire the round when they are ready or when the FO calls and tells them to fire. The FO spots the round and sends a correction back to the FDC and the process starts all over again until its done. The batteries are many kilometres behind the FLOT (Forward Line of Troops). They plan a location where they can be Fire Capability for some certain amount of time and do multiple fire missions before needing to displace. In normal operations the FOs locate targets and transmits the CFF to the FDCs. They can also calculate \\"defensive fire\\" tasks. These are pre‑planned missions, typically just in front of or upon one's own positions, designed with the intention of either suppressing potential attacks (where fire is dropped just in front of a friendly position), or in dropping fire on a recently abandoned or overrun position to prevent the enemy from consolidating there. Because the calculations have already been done, the fire can be called down very quickly when it is needed. =Reconnaissance and advance party= The advance party consists of the battery commander, his driver, first sergeant, gunnery sergeant, FDC guide, gun guides, and communications representatives. Initially the Party looks to find suitable positions for an artillery unit to perform fire missions from. Then they perform what is known as route reconnaissance. The primary purpose of this reconnaissance is to determine the suitability of the route of the units movement. Items to be analyzed include possible alternate routes, cover, concealment, location of obstacles, likely ambush sites, contaminated areas, route marking requirements, and the time and distance required to traverse the route. Several factors are taken into consideration. Once a location is determined and having arrived at the new position the advance party conducts a security sweep and prepares the position for occupation. The purpose of the advance party security with METT-T and the absence of enemy troops, mines, booby traps, NBC hazards, and so on. If these threats or conditions are present in the proposed position area, the advance party breaks contact with any enemy forces or marks minefield and hazards and moves on to find another position area. The battery commander can coordinate for additional assets, or augment the advance party with internal assets, to provide the additional ability to clear areas of small enemy forces, obstacles, and minefields. Natural cover must be used to the maximum. Security is continuous throughout advance party operations. Once a location is determined to be safe the advance party prepares the position for eventual howitzer emplacement. This consists of several procedures such as escorting each howitzer to its prepared position, setting up communications, providing the unit with its initial azimuth of fire, and providing each gun with an initial deflection. In the case of the U.S. Army, this entire process is covered in U.S. Army Field Manual 6-50 Chapter 2.U.S. Army Field Manual 6-50 Chapter 2 = Forward observer = Because artillery is an indirect fire weapon, the forward observer (FO) must take up a position where he can observe the target using tools such as binoculars and laser rangefinders and call back fire missions on his radio or telephone. The FO usually establishes a covered and concealed observation post (OP) on the ground, from which he can see the enemy. However, he may also be airborne—this was one of the first uses of aircraft in World War I. He must take great care not to be observed by the enemy, especially if in a static position. Discovery of an FO does not only jeopardize his personal safety; it also hampers the ability of the battery to lay fire. Using a standardized format, the FO sends map references and bearing to target, a brief target description, a recommended munition to use, and any special instructions such as \\"danger close\\" (the warning that friendly troops are within 600 meters of the target when using artillery, requiring extra precision from the guns). The FO and the battery iteratively \\"walk\\" the fire onto the target. The Fire Direction Center (FDC) signals the FO that they have fired and the FO knows to observe fall of shot. He then signals corrections. These are normally of the form of left/right of the bearing line and distance along it, for example \\"right 50 add 100\\" (distance in meters). When the fire is good enough the FO signals \\"target on, fire for effect\\". If the mission requires a walking barrage, he may continue sending correction orders. The FO may be called upon to direct fire for close air support and/or naval artillery in addition to field artillery based howitzer and infantry-embedded mortar units. The U.S. Army Field Manual describing the duties and responsibilities is FM 6‑30, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Observed Fire. Calling in and adjusting artillery fire on a target visible to a forward observer but not to the soldiers manning the guns, themselves =Fire direction center = Typically, there is one FDC for a battery of six guns, in a light division. In a typical heavy division configuration, there exist two FDC elements capable of operating two four-gun sections, also known as a split battery. The FDC computes firing data—fire direction—for the guns. The process consists of determining the precise target location based on the observer's location if needed, then computing range and direction to the target from the guns' location. These data can be computed manually, using special protractors and slide rules with precomputed firing data. Corrections can be added for conditions such as a difference between target and howitzer altitudes, propellant temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even the curvature and rotation of the Earth. In most cases, some corrections are omitted, sacrificing accuracy for speed. In recent decades, FDCs have become computerized, allowing for much faster and more accurate computation of firing data. The FDC at the battalion level is responsible for recording friendly and enemy positions, tracking available battery munitions, and determining the optimal response for engaging a target identified by the FO. =Command post= In most Artillery Batteries the Command Post (CP) controls the firing of the guns. It is usually located at the battery center so as to be able to communicate easily with the guns. The CP should be well camouflaged, but the CPO (Command Post Officer) should be able to see all the guns with ease. Gun markers are sometimes placed in front of the CP to remind the CPO which gun is in which position. The CPO is assisted by two \\"Acks\\"—i.e., assistants—who operate the fire data computers. The GPO (Gun Position Officer) and CPO work at the plotter to ensure that the data calculated by the Acks is accurate and safe. The CP signaller is contact with the OP, or Observation Post, where the Forward Observer Officer (FOO), works with the OP team to identify targets and call-back fire data. In recent years headset radios have become common for communication between the CPO and gun detachment commanders. =Firing Unit= The final piece of the puzzle is the firing unit itself. The FDC will transmit a warning order to the guns, followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuze setting, bearing, elevation, and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect (FFE). Elevation (vertical direction) and bearing orders are specified in mils, and any special instructions, such as to wait for the observer's command to fire relayed through the FDC. The crews load the howitzers and traverse and elevate the barrel to the required point, using either hand cranks (usually on towed guns) or hydraulics (on self- propelled models).  Counter-battery fire  Fire aimed at disabling or destroying enemy guns is known as counter-battery fire. Removing the threat posed by enemy artillery is an important objective on the battlefield. Most of the time enemy batteries are too far away for the infantry to engage, so it falls to artillery to do this job. The battery uses a variety of techniques to calculate the position of the enemy battery, then can lay fire upon it. If possible, a FO can access a position to call fire on enemy guns directly; either on the ground or in the air, or a battery can be located using counter- battery radar, which can be used to observe the fall of enemy shells and thus calculate their trajectory. A correctly calculated trajectory will reveal the location from which the shell was fired, which information can then be passed on to a friendly battery command post as a fire mission. = Defenses against counter-battery fire = To defend against counter battery fire there are two points of attack: either remove the enemy's ability to observe or make his observations irrelevant/obsolete. To remove the ability to observe one must attack the observation assets. Because most counter-battery radar is active, the location can be determined electronically from listening to the beams. If one suspects one's position is being observed by a covert FO then a mission, either artillery or infantry, will be raised to deal with this threat. Alternatively one can choose to make their observations obsolete by repeatedly moving the guns: hence self-propelled guns. Ordinary towed guns can take a while to emplace and re-limber and are not armoured, so they are vulnerable to counter battery fire and take a while to engage when at a new location. Self- propelled guns do not suffer from these restrictions. They can drive up, drop their trails, fire and move on. Because of their armour they are less vulnerable to counter-battery fire. However, this armor is light by comparison to that of a tank, so it protects only from light fire (e.g., machine guns) and shrapnel. Another disadvantage of self-propelled guns is that they tend to be equipped with lighter, less accurate guns. Depending on the nature of the battle being fought, either or both of these drawbacks could prove a severe restriction. However, this is not necessarily true of modern self-propelled guns such as the German PzH 2000\\\\. This has a 155 mm main armament that can with assisted firing charges reach 60 km, has a maximum speed of 67 km/h (41 mph) on road surface and 45 km/h (28 mph) off-road, and has a fully computerised fire-control system that enables it to fire-move-fire before the enemy can pin it down for counter-battery fire. It has a rate of fire of 10 rounds per minute. Parent battalion and U.S. Army brigade/USMC regimental FDCs FDCs also exist in the next higher parent battalion that \\"owns\\" two to four artillery batteries. Once again, an FDC exists at the U.S. Army brigade or USMC regimental level that \\"owns\\" the battalions. These higher level FDCs monitor the fire missions of their subordinate units and will coordinate the use of multiple batteries or even multiple battalions in what is called a battalion or brigade/regimental mission. In training and wartime exercises, as many as 72 guns from 3 battalions may all be coordinated to put \\"steel on the target\\" in what is called a \\"brigade/regimental time on target\\" or brigade/regimental TOT for short. The rule is \\"silence is consent\\", meaning that if the lower unit does not hear a \\"cancel the mission\\" (don't shoot) or even a \\"check firing\\" (cease firing) order from the higher monitoring unit, then the mission goes on. Higher level units monitor their subordinate unit's missions both for active as well as passive purposes. Higher-level units may also get involved to coordinate artillery fire across fire support coordination boundaries (often parallel lines on maps) where one unit can not fire into without permission from higher and/or adjacent units that \\"own\\" the territory.

It appeared in early November 1572 and was independently discovered by many individuals. The remnant of the supernova has been observed optically but was first detected at radio wavelengths; it is often known as 3C 10, a radio-source designation, although increasingly as Tycho's supernova remnant. Historic description Star map of the constellation Cassiopeia showing the position (labelled I) of the supernova of 1572; from Tycho Brahe's De nova stella The appearance of the Milky Way supernova of 1572 belongs among the more important observation events in the history of astronomy. The appearance of the \\"new star\\" helped to revise ancient models of the heavens and to speed on a revolution in astronomy that began with the realisation of the need to produce better astrometric star catalogues (and thus the need for more precise astronomical observing instruments). It also challenged the Aristotelian dogma of the unchangeability of the realm of stars. The supernova of 1572 is often called \\"Tycho's supernova\\", because of Tycho Brahe's extensive work De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa stella (\\"Concerning the Star, new and never before seen in the life or memory of anyone\\", published in 1573 with reprints overseen by Johannes Kepler in 1602, and 1610), a work containing both Tycho Brahe's own observations and the analysis of sightings from many other observers. Tycho was not the first to observe the 1572 supernova, although he was probably the most accurate observer of the object.Blast From The Past: Astronomers Resurrect 16th-Century Supernova ScienceDaily (Dec. 4, 2008) Almost as accurate were his European colleagues, such as Wolfgang Schuler, Thomas Digges, John Dee, Francesco Maurolico, Jerónimo Muñoz, Tadeáš Hájek, or Bartholomäus Reisacher.De mirabili Novae ac splendidis stellae, Mense Nouembri anni 1572, primum conspectæ, ac etiam nunc apparentis, Phœnomeno In England, Queen Elizabeth had the mathematician and astrologer Thomas Allen, come and visit \\"to have his advice about the new Star that appeared in the Cassiopeia to which he gave his Judgement very learnedly\\", as the antiquary John Aubrey recorded in his memoranda a century later.Oliver Lawson Dick, ed., Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts, 1949, s.v. \\"Thomas Allen\\" p. 5. In Ming dynasty China, the star became an issue between Zhang Juzheng and the young Wanli Emperor: in accordance with the cosmological tradition, the emperor was warned to consider his misbehavior, since the new star was interpreted as an evil omen.Science and Civilization in China, v.3 pp.425-6; cf. 1587, a Year of No Significance. The more reliable contemporary reports state that the new star itself burst forth soon after November 2, and by November 11 it was already brighter than Jupiter. Around November 16, 1572, it reached its peak brightness at about magnitude −4.0, with some descriptions giving it as equal to Venus when that planet was at its brightest. The supernova remained visible to the naked eye into early 1574, gradually fading until it disappeared from view. The supernova Light curve of Tycho's supernova, reconstructed from historical observations (via the Open Supernova Catalog) The supernova was classified as type I on the basis of its historical light curve soon after type I and type II supernovae were first defined on the basis of their spectra. The X-ray spectrum of the remnant showed that it was almost certainly of type Ia, but its exact classification continued to be debated until the detection of a light echo in 2008 gave final confirmation that it is a normal type Ia. The classification as a type Ia supernova of normal luminosity allows an accurate measure of the distance to SN 1572. The peak absolute magnitude can be calculated from the B-band decline rate to be . Given estimates of the peak apparent magnitude and the known extinction of magnitudes, the distance is kpc. Supernova remnant  The distance to the supernova remnant has been estimated to between 2 and 5 kpc (approx. 6,500 and 16,300 light-years), with recent studies suggesting a narrower range of 2.5 and 3 kpc (approx. 8,000 and 9,800 light-years). =Initial radio detection= The search for a supernova remnant was negative until 1952, when Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard reported a radio detection at 158.5 MHz, obtained at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. This was confirmed, and its position more accurately measured in 1957 by Baldwin and Edge using the Cambridge Radio Telescope working at a wavelength of . The remnant was also identified tentatively in the second Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources as object \\"2C 34,\\" and more firmly as \\"3C 10\\" in the third Cambridge list (Edge et al. 1959). There is no dispute that 3C 10 is the remnant of the supernova observed in 1572–1573. Following a 1964 review article by Minkowski, the designation 3C 10 appears to be that most commonly used in the literature when referring to the radio remnant of B Cas, although some authors use the tabulated Galactic designation G120.7+2.1 and many authors commonly refer to it as Tycho's supernova remnant. Because the radio remnant was reported before the optical supernova-remnant wisps were discovered, the designation 3C 10 is used by some to signify the remnant at all wavelengths. Tour of Tycho's Supernova Remnant =The X-ray observation= An X-ray source designated Cepheus X-1 (or Cep X-1) was detected by the Uhuru X-ray observatory at 4U 0022+63. Earlier catalog designations are X120+2 and XRS 00224+638. Cepheus X-1 is actually in the constellation Cassiopeia, and it is SN 1572, the Tycho SNR. =Optical detection= WISE infrared image is the remnant of SN 1572. Expansion of Tycho's Supernova Remnant from 2000-2015 The supernova remnant of B Cas was discovered in the 1960s by scientists with a Palomar Mountain telescope as a very faint nebula. It was later photographed by a telescope on the international ROSAT spacecraft. The supernova has been confirmed as Type Ia, in which a white dwarf star has accreted matter from a companion until it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit and explodes. This type of supernova does not typically create the spectacular nebula more typical of Type II supernovas, such as SN 1054 which created the Crab Nebula. A shell of gas is still expanding from its center at about 9,000 km/s. A recent study indicates a rate of expansion below 5,000 km/s. The companion star In October 2004, a letter in Nature reported the discovery of a G2 star, similar in type to our own Sun and named Tycho G. It is thought to be the companion star that contributed mass to the white dwarf that ultimately resulted in the supernova. A subsequent study, published in March 2005, revealed further details about this star: Tycho G was probably a main-sequence star or subgiant before the explosion, but some of its mass was stripped away and its outer layers were shock-heated by the supernova. Tycho G's current velocity is perhaps the strongest evidence that it was the companion star to the white dwarf, as it is traveling at a rate of 136 km/s, which is more than four times faster than the mean velocity of other stars in its stellar neighbourhood. This find has been challenged in recent years. The star is relatively far away from the center and does not show rotation which might be expected of a companion star. In Gaia DR2, the star was calculated to be light-years away, on the lower end of SN 1572's possible range of distances, which in turn lowered the calculated velocity from 136 km/s to only 56 km/s. In literature In the ninth episode of James Joyce's Ulysses, Stephen Dedalus associates the appearance of the supernova with the youthful William Shakespeare, and in the November 1998 issue of Sky & Telescope, three researchers from Southwest Texas State University, Don Olson and Russell Doescher of the Physics Department and Marilynn Olson of the English Department, argued that this supernova is described in Shakespeare's Hamlet, specifically by Bernardo in Act I, Scene i. The supernova inspired the poem \\"Al Aaraaf\\" by Edgar Allan Poe. The protagonist in Arthur C. Clarke's 1955 short story \\"The Star\\" casually mentions the supernova. It is a major element in Frederik Pohl's spoof science article, \\"The Martian Star-Gazers\\", first published in Galaxy Science Fiction Magazine in 1962.

Plot Eveready Harton (the name being a pun on \\"ever-ready hard-on\\") is sleeping. When two flies are found buzzing around his comically oversized penis, he shoots at them, causing the penis to detach and run in fear. Harton calls his penis back and begins looking around, watching dogs, snakes and birds all having sex and a woman masturbating. He puts a wheel underneath his now-hard penis and heads toward the woman. She asks Harton to lick her nipples, which he does; as he does, the nipple begins squirting breast milk, which Harton swallows. Meanwhile, the woman's vagina comes to life and starts fondling Harton's penis, and Harton begins the act of penetration—only to find that he cannot get his penis in, since her vagina is full of junk. Once he clears that out, he penetrates several times before being bit by a crab, which causes the penis to again detach, shriek in pain and run off. Harton runs after the penis, which finally rids itself of the crab by ejaculating on it and reattaches. Seeing the head of another beautiful woman sticking out from a pile of sand, Harton jumps on it and immediately starts humping it—only to realize he has inadvertently given anal to an old man already on top of the woman. Harton attempts to run away, but his penis is stuck in the old man's rectum, causing the old man to be dragged along behind. After some effort, he gets the penis out and hammers it straight. From there, Harton witnesses a farmer having sex with his donkey and challenges the farmer to a sword fight between their penises; Harton bites the other's penis, which goes limp. As Harton makes his move on the donkey, it runs away, causing Harton's penis to get hair stuck in it. In resignation, he sticks his penis into a fence hole, where a cow begins to lick the penis as the cartoon ends. History Eveready Harton According to Karl F. Cohen's 1998 book, Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons and Blacklisted Animators in America, rumor held that U.S. film labs refused to process the film, and it had to be developed in Cuba. The artists are unknown, but a widespread rumor states that a group of famous animators created the film for a private party in honor of Winsor McCay. Disney animator Ward Kimball gave the following account of the history of the short: > The first porno-cartoon was made in New York. It was called \\"Eveready > Harton\\" and was made in the late 1920s, silent, of course—by three studios. > Each one did a section of it without telling the other studios what they > were doing. Studio A finished the first part and gave the last drawing to > Studio B [...] Involved were Max Fleischer, Paul Terry and the Mutt and Jeff > studio. They didn't see the finished product till the night of the big show. > A couple of guys who were there tell me the laughter almost blew the top off > the hotel where they were screening it. When a copy of the short was screened in San Francisco in the late 1970s, the program notes attributed the animation to George Stalling, George Canata, Rudy Zamora, Sr., and Walter Lantz. The short circulated informally, shown only at small underground festivals or parties, until 2002 when it was included in the theatrically released compilation The Good Old Naughty Days.

It was originally built as a tithe barn for the estate of Culloden House, and in 1746 it was used by the Jacobite army as accommodation on the night before the Battle of Culloden. During the 19th century it was used as a blacksmith's workshop, before being taken over by the East Church of Inverness as a mission station in the early 20th century. When it was granted the status of a church extension charge in the 1970s, the congregation erected a new church called \\"the New Barn\\" (designed with architectural \\"barn metaphors\\") which is joined to the old building; the historic building (the \\"Old Barn\\") today serves as the church hall. Interesting architectural features of the Old Barn include the slit windows for defensive purposes and the parallel doors which can create a wind tunnel required for winnowing.

Through the memories of the book's narrator, Norman Clay, an American journalist of Spanish and Indian descent, Michener provides plenty of historical background, including a depiction of the fictitious Indian civilization that once flourished on city's periphery. The story focuses on bullfighting, but also provides insight into Mexican culture. The reader follows the bulls from their breeding to their \\"sorting\\" to the pageantry and spectacle of the bullring, where picadors and banderilleros prepare the bull for the entrance of the matador with his red cape. .

For a given prime number p, the Steenrod algebra A_p is the graded Hopf algebra over the field \\\\mathbb{F}_p of order p, consisting of all stable cohomology operations for mod p cohomology. It is generated by the Steenrod squares introduced by for p=2, and by the Steenrod reduced pth powers introduced in and the Bockstein homomorphism for p>2. The term \\"Steenrod algebra\\" is also sometimes used for the algebra of cohomology operations of a generalized cohomology theory. Cohomology operations A cohomology operation is a natural transformation between cohomology functors. For example, if we take cohomology with coefficients in a ring, the cup product squaring operation yields a family of cohomology operations: :H^n(X;R) \\\\to H^{2n}(X;R) :x \\\\mapsto x \\\\smile x. Cohomology operations need not be homomorphisms of graded rings; see the Cartan formula below. These operations do not commute with suspension—that is, they are unstable. (This is because if Y is a suspension of a space X, the cup product on the cohomology of Y is trivial.) Steenrod constructed stable operations :Sq^i : H^n(X;\\\\Z /2) \\\\to H^{n+i}(X;\\\\Z /2) for all i greater than zero. The notation Sq and their name, the Steenrod squares, comes from the fact that Sq^n restricted to classes of degree n is the cup square. There are analogous operations for odd primary coefficients, usually denoted P^i and called the reduced p-th power operations: :P^i \\\\colon H^n(X;\\\\Z /p) \\\\to H^{n+2i(p-1)}(X;\\\\Z /p) The Sq^i generate a connected graded algebra over \\\\Z /2, where the multiplication is given by composition of operations. This is the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. In the case p > 2, the mod p Steenrod algebra is generated by the P^i and the Bockstein operation \\\\beta associated to the short exact sequence :0 \\\\to \\\\Z /p \\\\to \\\\Z /p^2 \\\\to \\\\Z /p \\\\to 0. In the case p=2, the Bockstein element is Sq^1 and the reduced p-th power P^i is Sq^{2 i}. Axiomatic characterization showed that the Steenrod squares Sq^n\\\\colon H^m \\\\to H^{m+n} are characterized by the following 5 axioms: #Naturality: Sq^n \\\\colon H^m(X;\\\\Z /2) \\\\to H^{m+n}(X;\\\\Z /2) is an additive homomorphism and is functorial with respect to any f\\\\colon X\\\\to Y. so f^*(Sq^n(x)) = Sq^n(f^*(x)). #Sq^0 is the identity homomorphism. #Sq^n(x) = x \\\\smile x for x \\\\in H^n(X;\\\\Z /2). #If n> \\\\deg(x) then Sq^n(x) = 0 #Cartan Formula: Sq^n(x \\\\smile y) = \\\\sum_{i+j=n} (Sq^i x) \\\\smile (Sq^j y) In addition the Steenrod squares have the following properties: *Sq^1 is the Bockstein homomorphism \\\\beta of the exact sequence 0 \\\\to \\\\Z/2 \\\\to \\\\Z/4 \\\\to \\\\Z/2 \\\\to 0. *Sq^i commutes with the connecting morphism of the long exact sequence in cohomology. In particular, it commutes with respect to suspension H^k(X;\\\\Z /2) \\\\cong H^{k+1}(\\\\Sigma X;\\\\Z /2) *They satisfy the Ádem relations, described below Similarly the following axioms characterize the reduced p-th powers for p > 2. #Naturality: P^n: H^m(X,\\\\Z /p\\\\Z ) \\\\to H^{m+2n(p-1)}(X,\\\\Z /p\\\\Z ) is an additive homomorphism and natural. #P^0 is the identity homomorphism. #P^n is the cup p-th power on classes of degree 2n. #If 2n > \\\\deg(x) then P^n(x) = 0 #Cartan Formula:P^n(x \\\\smile y) = \\\\sum_{i+j=n} (P^i x) \\\\smile (P^j y) As before, the reduced p-th powers also satisfy Ádem relations and commute with the suspension and boundary operators. Ádem relations The Ádem relations for p=2 were conjectured by and established by . They are given by :Sq^i Sq^j = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\lfloor i/2 \\\\rfloor} {j-k-1 \\\\choose i-2k} Sq^{i+j-k} Sq^k for all i,j>0 such that i< 2j. (The binomial coefficients are to be interpreted mod 2.) The Ádem relations allow one to write an arbitrary composition of Steenrod squares as a sum of Serre–Cartan basis elements. For odd p the Ádem relations are :P^{a}P^{b} = \\\\sum_i (-1)^{a+i}{(p-1)(b-i)-1 \\\\choose a-pi} P^{a+b-i}P^i for aP^{a}\\\\beta P^{b} = \\\\sum_i (-1)^{a+i}{(p-1)(b-i) \\\\choose a-pi} \\\\beta P^{a+b-i}P^i+ \\\\sum_i (-1)^{a+i+1}{(p-1)(b-i)-1 \\\\choose a-pi-1} P^{a+b-i}\\\\beta P^i for a\\\\le pb. =Bullett–Macdonald identities= reformulated the Ádem relations as the following identities. For p=2 put :P(t)=\\\\sum_{i\\\\geq 0}t^i\\\\text{Sq}^i then the Ádem relations are equivalent to :P(s^2+st)\\\\cdot P(t^2)=P(t^2+st)\\\\cdot P(s^2) For p > 2 put :P(t)=\\\\sum_{i\\\\geq 0}t^i\\\\text{P}^i then the Ádem relations are equivalent to the statement that : (1+s\\\\text{Ad} \\\\beta)P(t^p+t^{p-1}s+\\\\cdots+ts^{p-1})P(s^p) is symmetric in s and t. Here \\\\beta is the Bockstein operation and (\\\\operatorname{Ad} \\\\beta) P = \\\\beta P - P\\\\beta. Computations =Infinite Real Projective Space= The Steenrod operations for real projective space can be readily computed using the formal properties of the Steenrod squares. Recall that :H^*(\\\\mathbb{RP}^\\\\infty;\\\\Z /2) \\\\cong \\\\Z /2[x], where \\\\deg(x) = 1. For the operations on H^1 we know that :\\\\begin{align} Sq^0(x) &= x \\\\\\\\\\\\ Sq^1(x) &= x^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ Sq^k(x) &= 0 && \\\\text{ for any } k>1 \\\\end{align} Using the operation :Sq := Sq^0 + Sq^1 + Sq^2 + \\\\cdots we note that the Cartan relation implies that :Sq\\\\colon H^*(X) \\\\to H^*(X) is a ring morphism. Hence :Sq(x^n) = (Sq(x))^n = (x + x^2)^n = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n {n \\\\choose i} x^{n+i} Since there is only one degree n+i component of the previous sum, we have that :Sq^i(x^n) = {n \\\\choose i}x^{n+i} Construction Suppose that \\\\pi is any degree n subgroup of the symmetric group on n points, u a cohomology class in H^q(X,B), A an abelian group acted on by \\\\pi, and c a cohomology class in H_i(\\\\pi,A). showed how to construct a reduced power u^n/c in H^{nq-i}(X, (A \\\\otimes B \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes B)/\\\\pi), as follows. # Taking the external product of u with itself n times gives an equivariant cocycle on X^n with coefficients in B \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes B. #Choose E to be a contractible space on which \\\\pi acts freely and an equivariant map from E \\\\times X to X^n. Pulling back u^n by this map gives an equivariant cocycle on E \\\\times X and therefore a cocycle of E/\\\\pi \\\\times X with coefficients in B \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes B. #Taking the slant product with c in H_i(E/\\\\pi, A) gives a cocycle of X with coefficients in H_0(\\\\pi, A \\\\otimes B \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes B). The Steenrod squares and reduced powers are special cases of this construction where \\\\pi is a cyclic group of prime order p=n acting as a cyclic permutation of n elements, and the groups A and B are cyclic of order p, so that H_0(\\\\pi, A \\\\otimes B \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes B) is also cyclic of order p. The structure of the Steenrod algebra (for p=2) and (for p>2) described the structure of the Steenrod algebra of stable mod p cohomology operations, showing that it is generated by the Bockstein homomorphism together with the Steenrod reduced powers, and the Ádem relations generate the ideal of relations between these generators. In particular they found an explicit basis for the Steenrod algebra. This basis relies on a certain notion of admissibility for integer sequences. We say a sequence :i_1, i_2, \\\\ldots, i_n is admissible if for each j, we have that i_j \\\\ge 2i_{j+1}. Then the elements :Sq^I = Sq^{i_1} \\\\cdots Sq^{i_n}, where I is an admissible sequence, form a basis (the Serre–Cartan basis) for the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. There is a similar basis for the case p>2 consisting of the elements :Sq_p^I = Sq_p^{i_1} \\\\cdots Sq_p^{i_n}, such that :i_j\\\\ge pi_{j+1} :i_j\\\\equiv 0,1\\\\bmod 2(p-1) :Sq_p^{2k(p-1)} = P^k :Sq_p^{2k(p-1)+1} = \\\\beta P^k Hopf algebra structure and the Milnor basis The Steenrod algebra has more structure than a graded \\\\mathbf{F}_p-algebra. It is also a Hopf algebra, so that in particular there is a diagonal or comultiplication map :\\\\psi \\\\colon A \\\\to A \\\\otimes A. induced by the Cartan formula for the action of the Steenrod algebra on the cup product. It is easier to describe than the product map, and is given by :\\\\psi(Sq^k) = \\\\sum_{i+j=k} Sq^i \\\\otimes Sq^j :\\\\psi(P^k) = \\\\sum_{i+j=k} P^i \\\\otimes P^j :\\\\psi(\\\\beta) = \\\\beta\\\\otimes1+1\\\\otimes\\\\beta. These formulas imply that the Steenrod algebra is co-commutative. The linear dual of \\\\psi makes the (graded) linear dual A_* of A into an algebra. proved, for p = 2, that A_* is a polynomial algebra, with one generator \\\\xi_k of degree 2^k-1, for every k, and for p > 2 the dual Steenrod algebra A_* is the tensor product of the polynomial algebra in generators \\\\xi_k of degree 2p^k-2 (k\\\\ge 1) and the exterior algebra in generators τk of degree 2p^k-1 (k\\\\ge 0). The monomial basis for A_* then gives another choice of basis for A, called the Milnor basis. The dual to the Steenrod algebra is often more convenient to work with, because the multiplication is (super) commutative. The comultiplication for A_* is the dual of the product on A; it is given by :\\\\psi(\\\\xi_n) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\xi_{n-i}^{p^i} \\\\otimes \\\\xi_i. where ξ0=1, and :\\\\psi(\\\\tau_n) = \\\\tau_n\\\\otimes 1 + \\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\xi_{n-i}^{p^i} \\\\otimes \\\\tau_i if p>2 The only primitive elements of A* for p=2 are the \\\\xi_1^{2^i}, and these are dual to the Sq^{2^i} (the only indecomposables of A). Relation to formal groups The dual Steenrod algebras are supercommutative Hopf algebras, so their spectra are algebra supergroup schemes. These group schemes are closely related to the automorphisms of 1-dimensional additive formal groups. For example, if p=2 then the dual Steenrod algebra is the group scheme of automorphisms of the 1-dimensional additive formal group scheme x+y that are the identity to first order. These automorphisms are of the form :x\\\\rightarrow x + \\\\xi_1x^2+\\\\xi_2x^4+\\\\xi_3x^8+\\\\cdots Algebraic construction gave the following algebraic construction of the Steenrod algebra over a finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_q of order q. If V is a vector space over \\\\mathbb{F}_q then write SV for the symmetric algebra of V. There is an algebra homomorphism :\\\\begin{cases} P(x)\\\\colon SVx\\\\to SVx \\\\\\\\\\\\ P(x)(v) = v+F(v)x=v+v^qx & v \\\\in V \\\\end{cases} where F is the Frobenius endomorphism of SV. If we put :P(x)(f)=\\\\sum P^i(f)x^i \\\\qquad p >2 or :P(x)(f)=\\\\sum Sq^{2i}(f)x^i \\\\qquad p =2 for f\\\\in SV then if V is infinite dimensional the elements P^I generate an algebra isomorphism to the subalgebra of the Steenrod algebra generated by the reduced p′th powers for p odd, or the even Steenrod squares Sq^{2i} for p = 2. Applications Early applications of the Steenrod algebra were calculations by Jean-Pierre Serre of some homotopy groups of spheres, using the compatibility of transgressive differentials in the Serre spectral sequence with the Steenrod operations, and the classification by Rene Thom of smooth manifolds up to cobordism, through the identification of the graded ring of bordism classes with the homotopy groups of Thom complexes, in a stable range. The latter was refined to the case of oriented manifolds by C. T. C. Wall. A famous application of the Steenrod operations, involving factorizations through secondary cohomology operations associated to appropriate Adem relations, was the solution by J. Frank Adams of the Hopf invariant one problem. One application of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra that is fairly elementary is the following theorem. Theorem. If there is a map S^{2n-1}\\\\to S^n of Hopf invariant one, then n is a power of 2. The proof uses the fact that each Sq^k is decomposable for k which is not a power of 2; that is, such an element is a product of squares of strictly smaller degree. Connection to the Adams spectral sequence and the homotopy groups of spheres The cohomology of the Steenrod algebra is the E_2 term for the (p-local) Adams spectral sequence, whose abutment is the p-component of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. More specifically, the E_2 term of this spectral sequence may be identified as :\\\\mathrm{Ext}^{s,t}_{A}(\\\\mathbb{F}_p, \\\\mathbb{F}_p). This is what is meant by the aphorism \\"the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra is an approximation to the stable homotopy groups of spheres.\\" See also *Pontryagin cohomology operation References =Pedagogical= * =References=  Allen Hatcher, Algebraic Topology.

S. and W. T. Crow. Burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis. EENY-542. University of Florida IFAS. 2012. It is a parasite of plants, and it is a pest of many agricultural crops. It is an especially important pest of bananas and citrus, and it can be found on coconut, avocado, coffee, sugarcane, other grasses, and ornamentals. It is a migratory endoparasite of roots, causing lesions that form cankers. Infected plants experience malnutrition.  History and distribution The nematode was first described from necrotic tissue in a species of Musa, the banana genus, in 1891. It is one of the most important root pathogens of banana crops, causing yield losses of up to 30 to 60% in many countries.Banana Nematodes: Pests and Diseases of American Samoa. Number 9. American Samoa Community College Community & Natural Resources Cooperative Research & Extension. 2004. It is known in temperate regions worldwide.  Morphology  Adults and juveniles are vermiform in shape. Adults are sexually dimorphic. The male has a poorly developed stylet, a knob-like head, and a sharp, curved spicule enclosed in a sac. The male is 500 to 600 µm in length, while the female is about 550 to 880 µm long. The female has a well-developed stylet. Both male and female have long, tapered tails with rounded or indented ends. Biology The nematode completes its life cycle in about 21 days at 25 °C. Luc, M., et al. Plant Parasitic Nematodes in Subtropical and Tropical Agriculture 2nd Ed. Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK: CABI Publishing. 2005. pg 616. Females and juveniles feed inside roots, especially near the tips. Males with their weak stylets do not feed. Females lay two to six eggs per day.Brooks, F. E. Burrowing nematode disease. American Phytopathological Society. 2013. The nematode causes a disease condition called toppling or blackhead disease in plants. In bananas they weaken the anchor roots and the plants can fall. The roots also fail to supply the plant with water and nutrients, causing reduced growth and development.Sarah, J. L., et al. The Burrowing Nematode of Bananas, Radopholus similis Cobb, 1913. INIBAP. 1996.  Management  The nematode load in the soil can be reduced with fumigation and crop rotation. Cover crops that are not susceptible to the nematode, such as Crotalaria or Tagetes, can be sown. Disease-free sprouts raised from clean tissue cultures can be used. Genetics It is notable as an early exemplar, along with Radopholus arabocoffeae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?name=Radopholus+arabocoffeae of the alternative flatworm mitochondrial code.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Conservative representative from 1927 to 1932, and again from 1936 to 1941. His father was also a member of the assembly from 1879 to 1881. He was born near Miami, Manitoba, the son of Andrew Laughlin and Rachel Bell. His parents had come to Manitoba from Ontario in 1877. Laughtlin was educated in Cartwright, at St. John's College and the University of Manitoba. He articled in law, was called to the Manitoba bar in 1905 and practised law in Cartwright. In 1909, he married Harriet Margaret McKay. Laughlin served as reeve for the Rural Municipality of Roblin. He became the solicitor for the Roblin municipality in 1920 and held this position until his death. Laughlin was also solicitor for the Bank of Toronto. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1927 provincial election, defeating Progressive incumbent Andrew E. Foster by 255 votes in the constituency of Killarney. He lost to Foster by 90 votes in the 1932 election, but defeated him by 509 votes in the campaign of 1936. The Conservative Party was Manitoba's primary opposition party during this period, and Laughlin sat with his party caucus on the opposition benches. In 1940, the Conservatives joined with the governing Liberal-Progressives in a coalition government. Laughlin became a backbench supporter of John Bracken's government, and was re-elected in the 1941 provincial election. He again defeated Andrew E. Foster, who was by this time a dissident Liberal opposing the coalition. Laughlin died at home in Cartwright of encephalitis several months after the election at the age of 62.

Much of modern hydrobiology can be viewed as a sub-discipline of ecology but the sphere of hydrobiology includes taxonomy, economic biology, industrial biology, morphology, physiology etc. The one distinguishing aspect is that all relate to aquatic organisms. Much work is closely related to limnology and can be divided into lotic system ecology (flowing waters) and lentic system ecology (still waters). One of the significant areas of current research is eutrophication. Special attention is paid to biotic interactions in plankton assemblage including the microbial loop, the mechanism of influencing water blooms, phosphorus load and lake turnover. Another subject of research is the acidification of mountain lakes. Long-term studies are carried out on changes in the ionic composition of the water of rivers, lakes and reservoirs in connection with acid rain and fertilisation. One goal of current research is elucidation of the basic environmental functions of the ecosystem in reservoirs, which are important for water quality management and water supply. Much of the early work of hydrobiologists concentrated on the biological processes utilised in sewage treatment and water purification especially slow sand filters. Other historically important work sought to provide biotic indices for classifying waters according to the biotic communities that they supported. This work continues to this day in Europe in the development of classification tools for assessing water bodies for the EU water framework directive. The hydrobiologist technician conducts field analysis. It identifies plants and living species, locates them, counts them. It identifies pollutions and nuisances that can affect the aquatic fauna and flora. He takes the samples and writes a report of his observations. The hydrobiologist engineer intervenes more in the process of the study. It defines the intervention protocols, the samples to be taken. He plans and programs the study campaigns and then summarizes his results.

The bank provides micro loans of about $60 each to the poor, as well as promoting a social charter that gave the film its title.The Documentary for Bangladesh The film was Gayle Ferraro's first, begun in 1997 and completed in 2000. It has been shown at multiple film festivals, including the 2001 New York International Independent Film and Video Festival and 2002 Women With Vision Film Festival. It won the Bronze Award for Women's Issues at the Houston Worldfest, and was broadcast by PBS in 2003 Arial Productions  Synopsis  Sixteen Decisions is filmed in an experimental style, skipping between past, present, and future to follow the life of a teenager named Selina. A sixteen-year-old mother of two, Selina lives a life typical for poor women in Bangladesh. She was a child laborer at the age of seven, married at the age of twelve, and had her first child at the age of thirteen. Her family sold their land to pay her dowry, and when her father lost his sight, they were left beggars. The $60 loan she receives from Grameen Bank allows her to put the down payment on a bicycle rickshaw and buy chickens whose eggs she can sell.Arial Productions Sixteen Decisions Synopsis.

It hydrolyzes in air, and samples are often contaminated with small amounts of NbOCl3. It is often used as a precursor to other compounds of niobium. NbCl5 may be purified by sublimation. Structure and properties Ball-and-stick model of niobium pentachloride Niobium(V) chloride forms chloro-bridged dimers in the solid state (see figure). Each niobium centre is six-coordinate, but the octahedral coordination is significantly distorted. The equatorial niobium–chlorine bond lengths are 225 pm (terminal) and 256 pm (bridging), whilst the axial niobium-chlorine bonds are 229.2 pm and are deflected inwards to form an angle of 83.7° with the equatorial plane of the molecule. The Nb–Cl–Nb angle at the bridge is 101.3°. The Nb–Nb distance is 398.8 pm, too long for any metal-metal interaction. NbBr5, TaCl5 and TaBr5 are isostructural with NbCl5, but NbI5 and TaI5 have different structures. Preparation Niobium pentachloride liquid and vapor Industrially, niobium pentachloride is obtained by direct chlorination of niobium metal at 300 to 350 °C: :2 Nb + 5 Cl2 → 2 NbCl5 In the laboratory, niobium pentachloride is often prepared from Nb2O5, the main problem being incomplete reaction to give the oxyhalides. The conversion can be effected with thionyl chloride:D. Brown \\"Niobium(V) Chloride and Hexachloroniobates(V)\\" Inorganic Syntheses, 1957 Volume 9, pp. 88–92. It also can be prepared by chlorination of niobium pentoxide in the presence of carbon at 300 °C. The products, however, contain small amounts of NbOCl3. Uses Niobium(V) chloride is the main precursor to the alkoxides of niobium, which find niche uses in sol-gel processing. It is also the precursor to many other laboratory reagents. In organic synthesis, NbCl5 is a specialized Lewis acid in activating alkenes for the carbonyl-ene reaction and the Diels-Alder reaction. Niobium chloride can also generate N-acyliminium compounds from certain pyrrolidines which are substrates for nucleophiles such as allyltrimethylsilane, indole, or the silyl enol ether of benzophenone.

Growing up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Robinson graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and went on to play point guard for the University of Michigan. After a strong showing in Michigan's 1989 NCAA championship, Robinson was drafted #10 in the first round of the 1990 NBA Draft. Early life Robinson was born in Mandeville, Jamaica, in the west-central portion of the island. His mother moved to the Boston area while he was a toddler, leaving him in his grandparents' care. Shortly after he turned 10 years old, his grandparents sent him to the United States in hopes of reuniting him with his mother. However, his mother made it clear that she didn't want him, and he was reduced to sleeping in apartment halls and Harvard College dorm stairways. Early in the 1977-78 school year, he was taken in by Helen and Lou Ford, a respected local couple. They adopted him in 1978. He blossomed into a star guard at CRLS, leading them to a state championship in 1986. College Robinson averaged 14.3 points and 5.7 assists during his collegiate career at the University of Michigan. He achieved fame during his junior year for sinking two crucial free throws with 3 seconds left in the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship to win the game for the Wolverines over Seton Hall University.ESPN Classic - Michigan wins behind Rumeal RobinsonEx-Michigan star Rumeal Robinson gets 6 years for fraud - ESPN His mother persuaded the city of Cambridge to name her street \\"Rumeal Robinson Way\\" in his honor. NBA career Robinson was drafted in 1990 by the Atlanta Hawks with the 10th pick. He was signed to a four-year deal with the Hawks. He also played for the New Jersey Nets, Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers. Robinson also spent time in the Continental Basketball Association. He played in the Euroleague during the 2001–02 season for KK Zadar. In the NBA, Robinson's play was very inconsistent. His last season as a regular player was 1992-93, his first year in New Jersey; after that year, he never played in more than 54 games a season. He was one of three Robinsons that the Portland Trail Blazers had in their line-up for the 1995–96 NBA season. The others were Clifford Robinson and James Robinson (both no relation). Robinson made some $5 million in the NBA, but spent it on a lavish lifestyle. He went through money so irresponsibly, he neglected to pay his bills. He was forced into bankruptcy in 1998. Post-playing career, criminal activity and conviction After his playing career was over, Robinson moved to Miami and attempted to become a property developer in his native Jamaica. He planned to build a 25,000 acre resort in his hometown called Harmony Cove. As part of his bid to attract investors, he persuaded his adoptive mother to take out a second mortgage on her house and lend it to Robinson as seed money. He promised to cover all the payments, and promised to give her $500,000 once the project was finished. However, his high living in the 1990s had all but destroyed his credit, and he was unable to find a bank willing to lend him any money. Through a friend, he was referred to Community State Bank in Ankeny, Iowa. The bank's senior loan officer, Brian Williams, approved a $377,000 bridge loan to Robinson's company, Megaladon Development—ostensibly to help with advertising and business plans. Robinson paid $100,000 of the loan back to Williams as a bribe to move the approval process forward. Over the next year and a half, Robinson received $1.2 million in loans from Community State Bank, all approved by Williams. However, he never paid the bank a single penny, and barely five percent of the money went toward developing Harmony Cove. The rest of it was used to buy expensive clothes, meals, motorcycles, jewelry, and other items. The fraud was uncovered when Williams tried to hide the bad loans by rolling the interest and penalties into the principal for a new loan. One of Williams' subordinates was alarmed enough to alert bank officials. Community State Bank fired Williams and sued Megaladon for nonpayment. In August 2006, Community State Bank won $535,000 in damages. During the proceedings, it emerged that Robinson hadn't paid taxes since his playing days. During depositions to ascertain his net worth, Robinson admitted he had no net worth, and lived on roughly $20 at a time. His only possessions were a change of pants. On August 24, 2009, a federal grand jury in Des Moines indicted Robinson, his girlfriend Stephanie Hodge, and Williams for bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank bribery, wire fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. Robinson surrendered to authorities on September 4. Soon after the arrest, his adoptive mother Helen Ford came forward and accused Robinson of swindling her out of her home. Unknown to Ford, Robinson had arranged to sell Ford's house to one of his business partners, Miami foreclosure specialist Rick Preston, for $250,000. Preston later sold the house to another business partner, Jorge Rodriguez, for $600,000. In turn, Rodriguez sold it to Stephen Hodge, the brother of Robinson's girlfriend at the time, for $1 million. The money was ostensibly intended to help build Harmony Cove, but was wasted on lavish spending and paying other debts. While Robinson initially tried to keep up the payments, the mortgage went unserviced for so long that a bank foreclosed on her house in 2007. In 2009, Ford was forced to move out of her home. By this time, Robinson had lost possession of his expensive condo in Aventura, and was living in a squalid, budget motel in North Miami Beach. Ford eventually got her home back in 2013. On September 8, 2010, Robinson was convicted on 11 counts of bank bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. On January 7, 2011, federal judge Ronald E. Longstaff sentenced Robinson to 6 years (78 months) in prison.Rumeal Robinson to lose part of pension fund in bank fraud case - ESPN He was also ordered to pay $1,184,615 million in restitution to Community State Bank and St. Paul Mercury Insurance. Robinson appealed his sentence in September 2011, claiming judge Longstaff had denied him a chance to change lawyers and had improperly taken his allocution statement into account at sentencing. A panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the sentence in December.Federal appeal In March, 2012, a federal judge ruled that US$369,000 of Robinson's pension fund could be seized to help cover restitution owed due to his sham business deal. Robinson served his sentence at various federal prisons in South Carolina, Louisiana and Florida. He was released on September 19, 2016 on five years' supervised release.

He was the son of Shaikh Awais Jalayir. Following the execution of his brother Shaikh Hasan Jalayir, the amirs placed Shaikh Hussain Jalayir on the throne. Almost immediately he had to deal with an invasion by his brother-in-law Shah Mahmud of the Muzaffarids of Iran. Shah Mahmud, who was the son-in-law of Shaikh Awais Jalayir, advanced a claim on Tabriz and took the city. Illness, however, forced him to abandon the region. This was followed by an invasion by the leader of the Muzaffarids, Shah Shuja, but despite taking the city, he was also forced to retreat due to a rebellion in Qazvin. It was only in the summer of 1376 that Shaikh Hussain Jalayir took up residence in Tabriz. In the following spring, he undertook a successful campaign against the Black Sheep Turkmen under Bairam Khwaja, who had been raiding from the west. Shaikh Hussain Jalayir's reign was marred by conflict with his surviving brothers; namely, Shaikh Ali Jalayir, Sultan Ahmed Jalayir, and Shaikh Bayazid Jalayir. Shaikh Hussain Jalayir also lost his popularity among many amirs who disliked his support of the powerful 'Adil Aqa, the governor of Ray. Shaikh Hussain Jalayir was faced with a series of uprisings, hostility among his brothers, and troubles with his external enemies. When 'Adil Aqa turned on him, Shaikh Hussain Jalayir lost his last powerful supporter. Sultan Ahmed Jalayir advanced from Arbadil and occupied Tabriz near the end of April 1382; he ordered Husain's execution. Ahmad would then himself take the throne, but conflict between him and 'Adil Aqa and Bayazid meant that the state fell into a period of disunity. References *Peter Jackson (1986).

He is best known for his seminal documentary film Afro-Punk (2003), exploring the African American experience in the punk and alternative music scene, and co-creating the Afropunk Festival.How Afropunk Became a Movement, Racked Magazine After the film's release, he curated the Liberation Sessions concert series which promoted black artistry via music and film, and then subsequently co-founded the annual Afropunk Festival in Brooklyn, working with it from 2005 through 2008, and later parting due to philosophical differences with its direction.Afropunk No Longer Punk, Vice Magazine Spooner later wrote and directed White Lies Black Sheep (2007), a fictional feature set within the punk world that premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. He also wrote the foreword for the book anthology \\"White Riot\\" which examines where race, identity and punk music intersect. Life Spooner grew up in the deserts of California, Panama, and the urban sprawl of New York City where he delved into the hardcore punk music scene and engaged in its culture. Later, he trained and produced work as a sculptor with gallery shows in both Seattle and New York.Afropunk Lives On, The Village Voice Though bi-racial, Spooner identifies as black. After visiting his family in St. Lucia, Spooner began to explore identity and race which later inspired the themes in his films and art. During his teens and early adulthood, Spooner was part of the predominantly Eurocentric hardcore punk scene, participating in the creation of zines, releasing records via his label, and attending shows. His label, Kidney Room Records, was a DIY punk record label putting out mostly emo-core / straight edge 7 inches. The name originates from the book Animal Liberation in which an animal, suffering from a vivisection experimentation, was referred to as the kidney in room 101. Spooner put out 3 records: Frail - Idle Hands Hold Nothing, Elements of Need/Jasmine split, and The Swing Kids first 7 inch. During his punk years, Spooner grew increasingly fascinated by the absence of dialogue around race among his friends in the scene and the disparity of black punk bands: Mick Collins, Fishbone, Vaginal Davis, and Bad Brains to name a few. Spooner understood punk rock as an offshoot of rock and roll and the pioneering work of black innovators like Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Jimi Hendrix, so he began to navigate why there were few people of color represented in the alternative punk music scene and why his peers did not engage with racial injustice in the way it had with animal rights, drugs/alcohol, feminism, and homophobia.Truly Indie Fans, New York Times Spooner also did not identify with mainstream media's representations of \\"blackness\\" and became focused on broadening the spectrum through his films and events by connecting alternative black people in the scene.We Still Need to be Seen, The Guardian Furthermore, he wanted to provide a platform for alternative black performers that were sidelined by the mainstream.Looking for the Punk, Nylon Magazine Spooner also worked as a prominent DJ in New York City, spinning at AfroPunk events, as well as The Limelight, Black Betty, Enids, Beauty Bar, Spa and the Edison in Los Angeles. He also promoted ON!,Followers of Fashion, Village Voice a popular mod soul night featuring Djs Daniel Collas of the Phenomenal Handclap Band and Nick Marc of TisWas. He also DJ'ed at SPA and promoted the long running Wednesday night parties \\"Shattered\\" and \\"SMF\\" featuring hip hop dj's spinning soul music. Film Spooner's documentary film, AfroPunkAfropunk: A Black Punk Documentary, NPR, explores race identity and the black experience in the alternative punk scene --then overwhelmingly white and taking place as the world shifted with the galvanizing power of the internet. Spooner's investigation into the untold stories of disaffected black youth and the black punk experience via film lead to the emergence of the Afropunk Festival,Afropunk Grown Up, Village Voice and gave a voice to alternative black youth who felt they did not fit into stereotypical notions of black identity propagated by the media.Gentrifying Afropunk, The New Yorker AfroPunk traces the experiences of a variety of black punks throughout the United States. In the DIY tradition, Spooner toured the film across the country like a band, screening it over 300 times at college campuses and film festivals. He amassed a devoted cult following, largely among minority punks who were active on a message board within his website afropunk.com. Through continued collected interest and participation from the film's followers, the film was a catalyst for a cultural black movement that lead to the AfroPunk Festivals (2005 to present). He discontinued participation in the festival after repeated conflicts with his partner.Has Afropunk Lost Its Soul?\\", Huffington Post Spooner also curated the film and music component of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's African Arts Festival and was the recipient of the ReNew Media Rockefeller Grant. He later wrote and directed a feature film entitled White Lies Black Sheep (2007), a fictional drama set in New York City's nightlife circa early 2000s. Both of his films premiered at national and international film festivals, including Toronto International Film Festival.White Lies, Black Sheep, Afrotoronto.com , The American Black Film Festival, Festival International de Cine de Mar del Plata, Milan International Film Festival, and garnered various awards such as Best Documentary at Jamerican International Film Fest. Later in 2008, Spooner directed a \\"Rock The Vote\\" commercial featuring Henry Rollins and produced various spots for Brave New Films. His work has been recounted in various publications, including NPR, Vice Magazine, The Village Voice, The New Yorker, Vibe, Fader Magazine, MTV, NBC News and Variety. Currently Upon his move to Los Angeles, Spooner taught himself to build bikes and began a monthly bike ride entitled \\"Freedom Ride: Black Kids On Bikes\\" that rode through predominantly black neighborhoods Black Kids on Bikes, but also made a statement with rides through wealthy white neighborhoods. Spooner is currently a tattoo artist at Monocle Tattoo Los Angeles, where he pioneered vegan friendly tattooing.Vegan Tattooing, Organic Life Magazine He is presently working on his first graphic novel, and he is co-curator for the Broad Museum's Summer Happenings.

He was elected three times as a Progressive Conservative Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba representing the Portage la Prairie riding from 1933 to 1943. He served as president of the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association from 1921 to 1923 and sat on the association's executive committee for 25 years. He served as president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) from 1922 to 1924 and set a precedent that future CAHA presidents would also be given two- year terms. The Allan Cup was formally recognized as the senior ice hockey championship of Canada while Sexsmith was CAHA president, and eligibility rules were expanded to allow more teams to compete for the title. Profits from the Allan Cup playoffs were invested into amateur and minor ice hockey and the Canada men's national ice hockey team. He began the efforts to establish a standard set of national ice hockey rules and amateur competitions between the United States and Canada. He sought to grow youth interest in the game and encourage sportsmanship, and spoke out against growing professionalism in the sport. He was the first president of the Portage Rink Company. He led efforts to build an arena and to establish a team in Portage la Prairie in 1919, and oversaw construction of a new arena when the original was destroyed by fire in 1936. Sexsmith was a lawyer before entering politics and was a partner with Arthur Meighen, the future Prime Minister of Canada. Sexsmith wanted improvements to infrastructure for drainage districts. He defended small businesses against the efforts of the Canadian Performing Rights Society, sought to reintroduce the 12-man jury system and the daytime speed limit in Manitoba, and supported using a compromise between representation by population and district representation. He was named a King's Counsel on January 1, 1938, in recognition of his legal career. He died in office on his 58th birthday, and was credited by the Winnipeg Free Press as a person who tackled contentious issues, and gave sound advice and constructive criticism. Early life and legal career alt=Arthur Meighen Sexsmith was born on August 23, 1885, in Napanee, Ontario, to parents Tobias Sexsmith and Jane Metcalfe, and moved westward with his parents at a young age. He completed his secondary school education in Portage la Prairie while reporting for the Portage Review and the Portage Daily Graphic. Sexsmith was known by the nickname \\"Toby\\" for most of his life. The name began during his time as an ice hockey player, and was reported by the Winnipeg Tribune to be linked to his father's name being Tobias. Sexsmith played as a winger on the 1906 Portage la Prairie men's ice hockey team, and was a teammate to Harry Scott. Sexsmith scored eleven goals in six games played for the Portage la Prairie Cities in the Manitoba Professional Hockey League. He had a career as an ice hockey referee after his playing days. He refereed senior ice hockey in Manitoba in 1912, and was still active as an official in 1924. Sexsmith served as an articled clerk with the firm Cooper & Meighen in 1911, then solely articled for Arthur Meighen in 1913. Sexsmith was called to the bar on June 30, 1915, then became a full partner with Meighen. After Meighen became the Prime Minister of Canada in 1920, Sexsmith partnered with J. C. Miller in the firm Sexsmith & Miller until 1922, then practiced law independently for the remainder of his career. Hockey administrator =Early involvement= Sexsmith was primarily responsible for the fundraising efforts to build the Portage Rink in 1919. He applied to the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA) for a senior ice hockey team based in Portage la Prairie for the 1919–20 season but was recommended for the lower level intermediate league instead, despite raising C$20,000 to construct a new arena. The Portage Rink was initially built with a tarpaulin covering that was replaced by a permanent roof in 1921. The additional $8,000 upgrade brought the completed construction cost to $28,000. Sexsmith later became involved with provincial and national sporting organizations. He was elected second vice-president of the Manitoba branch of the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU of C) in May 1920, and spoke out against growing professionalism in sport in Manitoba. He suggested that athletes competing for cash prizes be banned from ice hockey and other athletics. He also served as vice-president of the MAHA in 1920. In response to the AAU of C becoming more strict with player registrations, he felt the rule change by the MAHA to require player cards from the association where the player transferred from would be adequate, and no further action was required. He later served as MAHA president from 1921 to 1923. =CAHA president= alt=Building exterior Sexsmith was elected president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) on March 20, 1922, at the general meeting in Toronto, and succeeded W. R. Granger as president. The CAHA requested changes to the expand the eligibility for the Allan Cup, the national championship of Canadian senior hockey. The Cup's trustees were asked to allow any intermediate-level team to partake in the national playoffs if they were able to defeat a senior-level team. In September 1922, Sexsmith and the MAHA executive reserved the right to decide on which Winnipeg teams would participate in the Manitoba Senior Hockey League, after Winnipeg Amphitheatre ownership was unable to get an agreement on a league schedule. Sexsmith was re-elected president of the CAHA on March 23, 1923. He was nominated for a second term by Ontario Hockey Association president W. A. Fry, who felt that a two-year term was needed for a president to be effective once he was familiar with the role, as opposed to changeover annually. The Winnipeg Tribune expected that future CAHA presidents would also be given two-year terms. The CAHA and Allan Cup trustees reached an agreement in 1923, where profits from the Allan Cup playoffs would be held in trust and spent as requested by the CAHA. The Allan Cup was formally recognized as the senior ice hockey championship of Canada with an annual series of national playoffs. Teams participating in the semifinals and finals would have legitimate expenses reimbursed, with CAHA executives overseeing administration of schedules and finances. The agreement stipulated that a league must have at least three teams to be eligible for Allan Cup playoffs, and competition for the Cup remained subject to approval of the trustees. The CAHA appointed a committee to establish a standard set of national ice hockey rules. A second committee was named to discuss the increasing migration of players between Canada and the United States, in response to the AAU of C desire to be the sole authority for determining amateur status in Canada. In co-operation with the United States Amateur Hockey Association, the Willis Trophy was inaugurated for amateur competitions between the two countries. Sexsmith ruled that clubs from the Thunder Bay Amateur Hockey Association would not play in the MAHA due to constant arguments over placement in divisions. Sexsmith arranged for the 1924 Allan Cup finals to be played in Toronto instead of Ottawa, since the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals were moved from Montreal to Ottawa due to warm weather. The CAHA profited $5,865 from the 1924 Allan Cup playoffs, and contributed $2,000 towards the Canada men's national ice hockey team for their travels to ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics. =CAHA past-president= alt=Photo of trophy Sexsmith was succeeded as CAHA president by Silver Quilty at the general meeting in Toronto on March 29, 1924. Sexsmith negotiated an international exhibition series on behalf of the CAHA, between the 1926 Allan Cup champions from Port Arthur, Ontario, and the Central Hockey League champions from Duluth, Minnesota. He later sat on a special committee which oversaw the control of the Allan Cup transfer from its trustees to the CAHA. Sexsmith remained involved with hockey at the provincial level in Manitoba, and was named an MAHA delegate to the AAU of C's Manitoba branch. He negotiated on behalf of the MAHA when the Winnipeg Hockey Club returned to Manitoba from the jurisdiction of the Thunder Bay Amateur Hockey Association, after questions of the team's eligibility for the Allan Cup due to playing in an out-of-province league. Sexsmith toured central Manitoba on behalf of the MAHA to grow interest in minor ice hockey in 1925. He worked with the local Elks of Canada lodge in Portage la Prairie in 1926, to oversee youth hockey in the city and to encourage boys to play and learn sportsmanship. =Portage Rink Company= Sexsmith became the first president of the Portage Rink Company in 1919, and had been reelected every year since then. He continued to manage the Portage la Prairie intermediate level team within the MAHA, and later facilitated discussions to host a three-team intermediate level league based at the rink. The Portage Rink was destroyed by fire early in the morning on September 13, 1936. Due to windy conditions that night, the fire spread quickly and the building could not be saved. Insurance covered only $7000 in damages, and Sexsmith arranged a meeting of shareholders to plan a new building. Portage la Prairie tax payers approved a by-law to begin construction of a new rink with a financial guarantee of $15,000 from the city. Work on the new arena began in late November 1936. The first game was played at the completed rink on January 13, 1937. The new Portage Rink was built using concrete, had seating for 1,900 spectators and standing room for another 700, included a public address system, and cost approximately $21,000 to build. Sexsmith requested tax exemptions for the company from the city, to allow it to repay its bondholders. He declared the company a profitable business by 1941, and was a year-round community operation for ice sports in the winter and dances in the summer. He opened a skating bureau to accommodate the growing number of skating inquiries, and saw proceeds from skating increase as ice hockey decreased during World War II. =Later involvement= Sexsmith stated that ice hockey at the Olympic Games had became a farce by 1936, and should be eliminated. He felt that the money allocated to send a national team to Europe would be better spent on minor ice hockey in Canada. He was further opposed to the changes to the definition of amateur which the CAHA approved in 1936, which included allowing payments to players while away from work. He noted that the position of the MAHA as a whole was against the CAHA reforms that severed ties to the AAU of C. Sexsmith attended the silver jubilee for the MAHA in October 1938, with five of six past-presidents in attendance. He also attended the silver jubilee for the CAHA in April 1939, with 11 of 13 past-presidents in attendance. In October 1941, Sexsmith was elected to the Portage and District Hockey Club executive. By 1943, Sexsmith had sat on the MAHA executive committee for 25 years. Since being president, he had served on the registration committee, and acted as convenor for the intermediate level playoffs and the junior ice hockey B-level division. Political career alt=Building exterior Sexsmith served as secretary- treasurer of the Portage la Prairie Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba association for 25 years until 1933. On April 27, 1933, he was named as the Conservative candidate for the Portage la Prairie electoral district to replace Fawcett Taylor who resigned when he became a judge on the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba. Sexsmith submitted a request at the first meeting of the provincial government since prorogation, to call a by-election to fill the vacancy in Portage la Prairie. In the subsequent campaign, the Winnipeg Free Press reported that political issues were absent in the by-election, which seemed to a popularity contest between Sexsmith, and another local hockey figure in E. A. Gilroy who ran as an independent candidate. A third candidate, H. A. Ireland of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was reported to be a long shot. Sexsmith won the 1933 by-election by 238 votes over Gilroy. =19th Manitoba Legislature= Sexsmith served in the 19th Manitoba Legislature to represent the Portage la Prairie in opposition to the governing Liberal-Progressive coalition led by John Bracken. Sexsmith made his first speech in the legislature in March 1934, and declared himself a \\"true Blue Tory\\" and \\"a man of decided liberal and progressive views\\". Sexsmith was critical of legislation which changed the current drainage districts and readjusted the corresponding debentures. He felt that by appointing a commission, the government was avoiding an issue it could deal with directly. He noted that outdated systems could not adequately protect agriculture from floods, and new highway construction left some areas more vulnerable than others, and estimated the problem to cost $6-million. He sought to expedite negotiations with the Government of Canada for relief payments, and protect Manitoba from interest on infrastructure projects which included improvements to drainage. =20th Manitoba Legislature= Battle at the alt=Battle photo Sexsmith and Gilroy ran against each other again in Portage la Prairie during the 1936 Manitoba general election. The Winnipeg Free Press described the election as a \\"Battle of Hockey Moguls\\". Gilroy was nominated this time as a Liberal-Progressive candidate, and had served as president of the CAHA from 1934 to 1936. Sexsmith was re-elected to represent Portage la Prairie in the 20th Manitoba Legislature, receiving 1,727 votes compared to 1,279 for Gilroy. When the Manitoba legislature approved a motion to find ways to replace the existing income tax laws in 1937, Sexsmith stated the public had decided the existing tax laws be repealed and the motion misrepresented the position of the Conservative Party. Sexsmith supported a resolution calling for the Government of Canada to condemn the 1937 Japanese invasion of China, but did not support a boycott of Japanese goods. He felt the Manitoba legislature had no jurisdiction to regulate movement of goods which would be a national foreign policy. During the 1938 sitting, Sexsmith responded to complaints against the Canadian Performing Rights Society by introducing a motion to limit the efforts of the society. He felt that collection of fees was detrimental to small businesses in which music was played, and it was an injustice to the public. He also sought to revise existing provincial legislation which \\"coddled people too much\\" who owed debts. During the 1939 sitting, Sexsmith wanted to reintroduce the 12-man jury system in Manitoba, which he felt was the better system. He noted that the older provinces in Canada had retained the larger jury, compared to the 6-man jury being used in Western Canada. He also motioned to reintroduce the daytime speed limit in Manitoba, and stated that two-thirds of accidents on Manitoba highways were caused by excessive speed. Sexsmith also remarked that, \\"No one in this province, with the possible exception of the premier when he flies by plane, need go faster than 50 miles an hour\\". Sexsmith became chairman of the supporters of the Liberal-Progressive coalition government in October 1940. In December 1940, he argued that the coalition government pushed bills too fast through the house for the good of the public. He felt that bills should be scrutinized by one of the standing committees and give members time to adequately read the bill, instead of referring the bill to the whole house as the committee. He also felt the government was too slow in following-up on a bill to prevent members of illegal organizations from seeking elected office, which he felt would be a danger after World War II. =21st Manitoba Legislature= alt=The Memorial Cup trophy Sexsmith was acclaimed in the 1941 Manitoba general election to represent Portage la Prairie in the 21st Manitoba Legislature. When Premier Bracken asked legislature members if they would agree to a nighttime session of parliament on March 27, Sexsmith was opposed to longer hours while the Portage Terriers were in the 1942 Memorial Cup playoffs and felt compelled to support his hometown team. The session was adjourned as many other members had tickets to that night's game. The Terriers went on to win Portage la Prairie its first Memorial Cup and national championship. In March 1942, Sexsmith introduced a bill to allow Portage la Prairie to impose a 2% tax on liquor sales to its permit holders. He explained that similar to legislation existed in Winnipeg to raise funds, and that Portage la Prairie had not paid interest on its debts in three years and were struggling since relief payments from the province had been reduced. The bill passed a second reading by a 28–18 vote. The law amendments committee rejected the bill by a 12–3 vote two days later. Sexsmith then took the matter to the citizens of Portage la Prairie to decide on whether to support a plebiscite for the tax. When the Manitoba legislature discussed redistribution of ridings according to representation by population in March 1943, Sexsmith and fellow rural members supported using a compromise between population and district representation. He felt that giving more voting power to Winnipeg was a worse inequality than the current district representation. =Death in office= Sexsmith died early in the morning on August 23, 1943, at Portage General Hospital, on his 58th birthday. He was admitted to the hospital a week prior for surgery but his condition worsened unexpectedly. His funeral was held on August 26, 1943, at St. Mary's Anglican Church, and he was interred at Hillside Cemetery in Portage la Prairie. While a member of the legislative assembly, Sexsmith was the only member known by his nickname. He was succeeded by Charles Greenlay, who won the Portage la Prairie riding in a 1943 by- election. Personal life Sexsmith was an avid recreational hunter, and reportedly a good shot. He was a partial owner of a shooting lodge in Delta Beach, Manitoba, until the building was consumed by fire on November 1, 1920. He married Mildred Howell on November 19, 1927, and never had children. He was a member of the Knights of Pythias, the Elks of Canada, and the Anglican Church of Canada. He also served on the first council of the branch of St. John Ambulance Canada established in Portage la Prairie in December 1942. Honours and legacy Sexsmith was the guest of honour at a banquet for him by the citizens of Portage la Prairie in 1923, in recognition of his sporting accomplishments and service as president of the CAHA. He received a medal for his services to the CAHA in April 1933, and was named a King's Counsel on January 1, 1938, in recognition of his legal career. He was also named as an honorary president of the MAHA, and the Portage Midget and Juvenile Hockey League. In his obituary, the Winnipeg Free Press credited Sexsmith as a person who tackled contentious issues, and gave sound advice and constructive criticism. Stuart Garson, the Premier of Manitoba paid tribute to Sexsmith by praising his contribution to the community and encouragement of young people in sports, and said \\"Sexsmith was an exceptionally able member\\" of the legislature who was impartial and excelled at debate. Sexsmith was recognized with a moment of silence at the 1943 general meeting of the MAHA, and was posthumously made the namesake of the Toby Sexsmith Memorial Trophy awarded to the champion team of the B-level midget age group in Manitoba.

It ceased operation on December 31, 2009, after being amalgamated with Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC). DEVCO was organized primarily into two divisions: a community economic development organization, and the coal division. From March 30, 1968, until November 23, 2001, DEVCO's coal division operated Canada's largest underground coal mines, located in eastern Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia. Following decommissioning of its mines, DEVCO sold all non-mining surface assets to the private sector on December 18, 2001, including the Devco Railway and is now remediating its mine sites. Creation of DEVCO In 1965, the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, or DOSCO (then a subsidiary of the Hawker Siddeley Group) announced that its mines had only 15 years of production left and concluded that the expense of opening new underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field would be too expensive. The company made its intentions clear that it would be exiting the coal mining business within months. In response to a vast public outcry in industrial Cape Breton County, the minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced J.R. Donald would head a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Cape Breton coal industry, with hearings held in 1965 and 1966. The Donald Commission recommended that a federal Crown corporation be established to acquire and manage DOSCO's coal operations, with the aim being to slowly wean the Sydney area economy off the coal industry. ::\\"Future planning should be based on the assumption that the Sydney mines will not operate beyond 1981.\\" On July 7, 1967, the Cape Breton Development Corporation, or DEVCO, was established to operate the mines in the interim, while phasing them out throughout the 1970s and, at the same time, develop new economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. On March 30, 1968, DEVCO expropriated DOSCO's coal mines and the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, settling for a payment of $12 million. At the same time, the Government of Nova Scotia took over the operation of DOSCO's integrated steel mill in Sydney, renaming the operation Sydney Steel Corporation, or SYSCO. Early operation, planning for retraction DEVCO had several operating divisions, including its Coal Division, as well as economic development divisions, intended to help the Industrial Cape Breton area diversify its economy from an over-reliance on the coal and steel industries. Initially, DEVCO focused on operating the coal mines throughout the Sydney Coal Field that it had inherited from DOSCO, while attempting to invest in other initiatives such as establishing a post-secondary education institution in the area (what would become the University College of Cape Breton, now Cape Breton University), tourism developments, industrial parks for non-coal/steel related manufacturing industries, and investing in small area businesses and community infrastructure projects to help unemployed coal miners and steel workers who had been laid off during the 1960s drawdown in production. One of DEVCO's first tourism-related developments in the early 1970s was the Cape Breton Steam Railway, a joint project with the Sydney and Louisburg Railway Historical Society, which saw unused Devco Railway tracks between Glace Bay and Port Morien used for operating a tourist railway, with coal-powered steam locomotives. The project ran until it proved to be uneconomic to operate by the late 1970s. Overall, until 1973, DEVCO was more-or-less focused on continuing the operation of its former-DOSCO mines and railway, while providing new economic growth for the region. Expansion of coal mining The October 1973 Yom Kippur War and the ensuing 1973 oil crisis led the federal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to re-examine all Canadian energy production, including the nationalization of Alberta oil, as well as an expansion of DEVCO coal production, reversing the recommendation of the 1966 Donald Commission to phase out coal production and diversify the economy of Industrial Cape Breton. The Trudeau government sought to use its ownership of DEVCO to reverse Nova Scotia's reliance on the importation of foreign oil for generating electricity; approximately 70% of the province's electricity was generated by foreign oil by the late 1970s. New mines were built and opened near New Waterford (Phalen and Lingan collieries) and at the northeastern tip of Boularderie Island (Prince colliery) between 1972-1975. Devco Railway built a spur to serve the adjacent Phalen and Lingan mines, extending the line to serve Nova Scotia Power Incorporated's Lingan Generating Station which opened November 1, 1979. During the early 1980s, the Devco Railway retired its diesels locomotives inherited from the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, which had purchased them second-hand during the early 1960s, and purchased a fleet of new diesel locomotives and coal hoppers, as well as building new locomotive shops at Victoria Junction, between Sydney and Glace Bay, and shut down the Glace Bay roundhouse and machine shops. It also built the tunnels and some surface support infrastructure for a new mine at Donkin in the early 1980s, however, this mine never went into production and the surface and sub-surface assets were mothballed. DEVCO also shut down a coal wash plant at Sydney Mines and built a large coal preparation/mixing and wash plant at Victoria Junction in its place. DEVCO continued to open the new mines at Phalen, Lingan and Prince while shutting older DOSCO-era mines in Glace Bay and New Waterford; particularly after a fatal explosion on February 24, 1979, at the antiquated No. 26 Colliery which killed 12 miners. Finally, DEVCO, built a new international shipping pier facility on Sydney Harbour near Whitney Pier, replacing the antiquated export piers inherited from DOSCO. With federal government financing, DEVCO was in expansion mode and with the high international prices for coal, sought to produce more Cape Breton coal for export than ever before. Production problems and mine closures By the late 1980s, production problems at DEVCO saw the last of the older mines inherited from DOSCO shut down, with production concentrated at Lingan, Phalen and Prince; the latter not receiving any rail service. The Point Aconi Generating Station was built by Nova Scotia Power Incorporated to receive coal from the Prince colliery directly by conveyor belt, however the Lingan and Phalen mines still hauled coal to the Victoria Junction preparation plant and then to the Lingan Generating Station. The SYSCO steel mill stopped using DEVCO coal to produce coke as a fuel for its blast furnaces in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, SYSCO had modernized by changing to an electric-arc process, smelting recycled metal. Problems with flooding and roof-falls at the Lingan mine saw production cease in 1992, just months short of the colliery's 20-year design limit. The Phalen mine continued to be the only source of online traffic for the Devco Railway, however subsequent flooding and roof-falls at Phalen caused ever increasing production costs at a time of fiscal restraint by the federal government. In mid-2008 DEVCO sponsored the new Industrial Research Chair in Mine Water Remediation & Management at Cape Breton University in order to assist in the mine closure and to research in new environmentally friendly after uses of the mining legacy. Layoffs and selling of assets Faced with rising subsidies for DEVCO, the federal government announced it was getting out of the coal industry in January 1999 by mining out the rest of Phalen by the end of the year and attempting to sell the Prince colliery. In September 1999, Phalen colliery closed for good, with 400 employees laid off and the only on-line traffic source for the Devco Railway severed. The Prince colliery continued with production, however coal was trucked from the mine to the Victoria Junction preparation plant, from which it was then taken by rail to the Lingan Generating Station. Devco Railway also began to be used for importing some coal from locations in the United States and South America, with the international shipping piers beginning to be used in the reverse of their intended design. On November 23, 2001, Prince colliery closed for good, after the federal government failed to entice any private sector investors to purchase the mine. DEVCO was out of the coal mining business, however for a period of approximately 1 month, it was in the coal importation business. The federal government moved swiftly to sell off assets, transferring the mine properties and mineral rights back to the provincial Department of Natural Resources. DEVCO subsequently decommissioned the Victoria Junction coal wash plant and began to immediately prepare remediation of the mine sites. On December 18, 2001 DEVCO sold all surface assets, including the international shipping piers, railway track, railway rights-of-way, locomotives and rolling stock, and a coal storage facility and locomotive shops at Victoria Junction to 510845 New Brunswick Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera Inc., the holding company which owns Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (Nova Scotia Power Corporation having been privatized in 1992). Emera subsequently contracted the operation of its newly acquired DEVCO surface assets to Logistec Corporation. Logistec sub-contracted operation of the railway to the Société des chemins de fer du Québec, a Quebec-based railway holding company and short-line operating company. The new railway was called Sydney Coal Railway, although ownership of the track and other assets remains with Emera's subsidiary, 510845 New Brunswick Inc. Logistec operates the international piers, which handles coal imports from the United States and South America, while Sydney Coal Railway hauls the coal to the storage facility at Victoria Junction before transporting it to NSP's Lingan Generating Station. Cessation of DEVCO On December 31, 2009, DEVCO was amalgamated with Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation (ECBC).

Zenebework's full title was \\"Her Imperial Highness, Princess Zenebework Haile Selassie\\". Biography On 15 June 1932, Princess (Leult) Zenebework was married to the hereditary prince of eastern Tigray Province, Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa, a great-grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV. She was not yet 15 years old when they were married in Addis Ababa. Haile Selassie Gugsa was the son of Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie. He was thus the great- grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia by his son Ras Araya Selassie. At the time, western Tigray was ruled by Ras Seyoum Mengesha, the son of Ras Mengesha Yohannes, another heir of Emperor Yohannes. The marriage between Princess Zenebework and Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa was part of a dynastic alliance that also included the marriage of her brother, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen to Princess Wolete Israel Seyoum, the daughter of Ras Seyoum Mengesha. Ties were thus strengthened between the reigning Shewa branch of the Imperial dynasty with both rival sides of the Tigrean branch of the dynasty. The marriage between Princess Zenebework and Dejazmach Haile Selassie however was evidently not a happy one, and the Princess is said to have complained of poor treatment. On his side, Dejazmach Haile Selassie resented that his cousin and rival Seyoum held the title of Ras while he was relegated to the lower rank of Dejazmach. The two branches of Emperor Yohannes's family had long competed for seniority, and although the province of Tigray had been split between them, Haile Selassie Gugsa resented not having the title of Ras. Princess Zenebework died suddenly in 1934, and upon hearing of her death, the distraught Emperor ordered that her body be flown immediately from Mekele and be brought to Addis Ababa for burial. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have had something to do with the Princess having repeatedly complained of her treatment at the hands of her husband and his family. This added to the resentment felt by her husband towards the Emperor, and a chill developed between the Emperor and his son-in-law. Upon the Italian invasion in 1935, Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa shocked the Imperial family and his country by being among the first to join the Italians. The Italians rewarded him with the title of Ras, and recognized him as the senior prince of Tigray over Ras Seyoum who would later surrender to them and be placed under house arrest. Following the liberation of 1941, Haile Selassie Gugsa was labeled a traitor, and was placed under house arrest. His title of Ras that was bestowed by the Italians was not recognized by the Ethiopian government and he reverted to his old title of Dejazmach. He was not freed from his house arrest until after the fall of the Ethiopian monarchy in 1974, and died shortly thereafter. Princess Zenebework is buried in the Imperial family crypt under Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa. A hospital in the city was established in her memory.

The city is located in the central plains of Venezuela and was founded on February 25, 1785, by Father Mariano Martí. Along with Zaraza, Calabozo and San Juan de Los Morros (the state capital), Valle de la Pascua is one of the most important cities in the state of Guárico and the most important economically. The vicinity of the city was the scene of the Battle of Valle de la Pascua in February 1814. History Valle de la Pascua was founded in the 18th century as part of the colonization and expansion of the Spanish presence on to the Alto Llano de Caracas, the name given to the central plains of the then Province of Venezuela, whose capital was Caracas. In 1726, with the authorization of the government in Caracas, Capitán Francisco Carlos de Herrera, the regional administrator, granted the town of La Aguada de Valle de la Pascua together with the large cattle ranch called Santa Juana de la Cruz, to José Zamora. However the origins of Spanish settlement started with cattle ranches founded by Francisco Zamora Granados and his brother-in-law, Gabriel Sánchez Sajonero, who, the year previously, had arrived from Altagracia de Orituco and settled in the valley with their families, equipment and cattle. The Law of Territorial Division of Gran Colombia, dated 25 June 1824, divided the Province of Caracas, of the Department of Venezuela, into twelve cantons (counties). Valle de la Pascua was placed in Chaguaramas canton. In 1848, by the presidential order of General José Tadeo Monagas, the Province of Caracas was redivided into four cantons and twenty-seven parishes. The parish of Valle de la Pascua was placed together with the canton capital of Chaguaramas, and the parishes of Chaguramal del Peral, Santa María de Ipire, Altamira, Altagracia de Iguana, Espino, Cabruta and Santa Rita de Manapire into Chaguaramas canton. In 1853 the canton of Chaguaramas was divided in two: Chaguaramas and Unare. Chaguaramas kept the town of Chaguaramas, Valle de la Pascua, Espino, Cabruta and Santa Rita de Manapire.Peter F Anson Bishops at Large (London, 1964) Candlemas Fairs In the winter of 1939–1940 during their Candlemas Fiesta (Festival), Valle de la Pascua held a Candlemas Fair. That year they had over 15,000 visitors.Historia:Ferias de la Candelaria in Spanish The fairs provide both entertainment and the opportunity to show the products from the region. Economy This city is known for its agricultural and livestock and for being one of the most important industrial areas of the Venezuelan Llanos. It has a population of approximately 182,000 inhabitants, which are devoted mostly to industrial activities and agricultural and professional. Sites in the area include the Cathedral of Our Lady of Candlemas, the House of the Islanders, Ruben Zamora Church and Casa de la Cultura. It is a quite popular with tourists for tours of the countryside rangers, through companies that organize tours that lead to sites such as the artificial lake and the dam of Playa de Piedra. Valle de la Pascua is among the cities of the State of Guarico with Calabozo and San Juan de Los Morros (state capital).

The park covers some , centred on the artificial Strathclyde Loch. It is located next to the River Clyde between Hamilton and Motherwell. Strathclyde Park forms what used to be known as the Low parks of the now demolished Hamilton Palace and still includes buildings associated with the palace. When the loch was created in the early 1970s it involved the flooding of the old mining village of Bothwellhaugh. Bothwellhaugh The park offers many amenities and attractions such as coarse angling, woodland walks, watersports, and a camping and caravanning site. One of Scotland's theme parks, M&D;'s, is located in the park. Until 1996, the music festival T in the Park was held here. The west side of the park is bounded by the River Clyde, which was diverted when the loch was built in 1975. The original course can be seen between the east loch shore and the island. Across the Clyde is the M74 motorway, which creates a significant level of noise. The east side of the park is quieter, with woodland and paths leading up the slopes to Motherwell. The remains of Bothwellhaugh Roman Fort and a Roman bathhouse can be seen in the park, where the South Calder Water flows into the loch. There is an arched Roman bridge across the South Calder nearby. The site of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679) is to the north west of the park. Although the focus of the park is on recreation, a variety of habitats are present, including wetlands and native woodland. The Greenlink Cycle Path start-off point is located in the park and travels to Motherwell Town Centre. Also, a section of the Clyde walkway, from Glasgow to New Lanark, runs through the park. Rowing Major events held at the loch include the rowing events for the 1986 Commonwealth Games, the 1996 World Rowing Junior Championships (and the World Rowing Championships for non- Olympic events), the 2005 World Rowing Masters Regatta, the 2007 World Rowing U23 Championships the 2006 and 2014 Commonwealth Rowing Championships. and the 2018 European Rowing Championships. The loch also hosts the British Rowing Championships once every four years, which are normally held in Holme Pierrepont, Nottingham, and also every four years hosts the Home International Regatta. The park is home to Strathclyde Park Rowing Club, Edinburgh University Boat Club, Heriot-Watt University Boat Club and to the Scottish Rowing Centre.

Career During his concert career, from 1958 to 1981, he premiered hundreds of new works for the guitar. He taught at the Liceo Musicale G. B. Viotti in Vercelli from 1965 to 1981, and held a professorship at the Antonio Vivaldi Conservatory in Alessandria from 1981 to 2004. The Conservatory awarded him the Marengo Music Prize in 1998. Gilardino has composed much music for solo guitar, as well as chamber music and concertos. His solo works include five volumes of Studi di virtuosità e di trascendenza (1981-1988), two numbered sonatas (1985, 1986) as well as several titled sonatas and sonatinas, two sets of variations (1989, 1991), and Ikonostas for a guitar tuned in G (2004). The Studi di virtuosità e di trascendenza represent one of the most significant contributions to the guitar repertoire in the 20th century. The title places the collection in the tradition of the Transcendental Etudes by Franz Liszt. Numbers 1 through 48 have dedications that play an important role in identifying influences and traditions that are important to the composer, and help provide a context in which to interpret the individual etudes. These have been recorded by the guitarist Cristiano Porqueddu for Brilliant Classics. He has also written four works for guitar with guitar orchestra, seven concertos for guitar, some in combination with other instruments (including mandolin and accordion), and several duets (for guitar with bassoon, cello, violin and vibraphone). From 1967 to 2006, Gilardino supervised the publication of hundreds of new guitar works by Edizioni Musicali Bèrben. He has also discovered the Variazioni by Ottorino Respighi and several works written for the guitarist Andrés Segovia by Cyril Scott, Pierre de Bréville, Lennox Berkeley and many others. He was artistic director of the Andrés Segovia Foundation of Linares from 1997 to 2005. In 2009 the Guitar Foundation of America conferred upon him the prestigious Artistic Achievement Award which is reserved for performers, composers, pedagogues, and scholars who have made monumental contributions to the development of the art and life of the classical guitar. Quotes *\\"I am not a good interpreter of my own music - I never played it and I avoid giving lessons with my music on the stand. \\" - rec.music.classical.guitar (Jan 23 2003) *\\"I have no connection with my pieces, except when I am composing them. Since then, especially when published, they belong to everybody, and I am no longer especially fond of a piece or of another. I feel insignificant and unimportant in respect of the music I write. I have to add - to be quite honest - that when teaching I do not like to deal with my own music. [...] when it happens I have to teach a piece of my own, I feel rather uncertain about what to say.\\" - Interview with Angelo Gilardino *\\"Actually, since 1981 to March of this year I was active as a professor in a conservatory and - even without giving concerts - I followed learning a lot about guitar, due mainly to the excellence of students who have cooperated with me. But, I confirm, you are right, I am no technician at all - my work with players has developed in the area of interpretation.

His photo Afghan Girl, of a girl with piercing green eyes, has appeared on the cover of National Geographic several times. McCurry has photographed many assignments for National Geographic and has been a member of Magnum Photos since 1986. McCurry is the recipient of numerous awards, including Magazine Photographer of the Year, awarded by the National Press Photographers Association; the Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal; and two first-place prizes in the World Press Photo contest (1985 and 1992). Life and work McCurry attended Penn State University. He originally planned to study cinematography and filmmaking, but instead gained a degree in theater arts and graduated in 1974. He became interested in photography when he started taking pictures for the Penn State newspaper The Daily Collegian. After a year working in India, McCurry traveled to northern Pakistan where he met two Afghans who told him about the war across the border in Afghanistan. McCurry's career was launched when, disguised in Afghani garb, he crossed the Pakistan border into rebel- controlled areas of Afghanistan just before the Soviet invasion. \\"As soon as I crossed the border, I came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out,\\" he says. He left with rolls of film sewn into his turban and stuffed in his socks and underwear. These images were subsequently published by The New York Times, Time and Paris Match and won him the Robert Capa Gold Medal for Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad. McCurry covered more armed conflicts like the Iran–Iraq War, Lebanon Civil War, the Cambodian Civil War, the Islamic insurgency in the Philippines, the Gulf War and the Afghan Civil War. There have been a couple of dangerous moments where McCurry came close to losing his life. He was almost drowned in India and he survived an airplane crash in Yugoslavia. McCurry has had his work featured in magazines worldwide and he is a frequent contributor to National Geographic. McCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the landscape, but to the people who inhabit that land. \\"Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person’s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human condition.\\" What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the \\"human connection between all of us.\\" He believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language, ethnicity, etc. McCurry also states, \\"I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story.\\" However, sometimes McCurry has witnessed some \\"horrific\\" and \\"distressing\\" sights. In times like these, he uses his camera as a \\"shield\\" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder. On September 10, 2001, McCurry had just gotten back from Tibet. The morning of September 11, McCurry received a call saying the World Trade Center was on fire. He went up to the roof of his building and started taking photographs, he didn't know it was a plane that hit the towers. McCurry was on the roof when both of the towers fell, \\"they were just gone. It didn’t seem possible. Like you’re seeing something but you don’t really believe what you’re seeing.\\" After the fall of the towers, McCurry ran to Ground Zero with his assistant. He describes the scene, \\"there was this very fine white powder everywhere and all this office paper, but there was no recognizable office equipment—no filing cabinets, telephones, computers. It seemed like the whole thing had been pulverized.\\" McCurry left later that night and went back early on September 12, he didn't have any press credentials and had to sneak past security. He was eventually caught and escorted off Ground Zero, he wouldn't go back again. McCurry is portrayed in a TV documentary The Face of the Human Condition (2003) by Denis Delestrac. McCurry switched from shooting color slide film to digital capture in 2005 for the convenience of editing in the field and transmitting images to photo editors. He said that he had no nostalgia about working in film in an interview with The Guardian. \\"Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over... The quality has never been better. You can work in extremely low light situations, for example.\\" McCurry shoots in both film and digital, but says he prefers shooting with transparency film. Eastman Kodak gifted him the last roll of Kodachrome film to ever be produced by Kodak. McCurry shot the roll, which was processed in July 2010 by Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas. Most of these photos were published on the Internet by Vanity Fair. McCurry states, \\"I shot it for 30 years and I have several hundred thousand pictures on Kodachrome in my archive. I'm trying to shoot 36 pictures that act as some kind of wrap up – to mark the passing of Kodachrome. It was a wonderful film.\\" In 2015, he was hired by Microsoft to take photographs in areas of New Zealand, which were used as wallpapers in Windows 10. In 2019, his book Steve McCurry. Animals was published by Taschen and is a compilation of his favorite photographs of animals. =Afghan Girl= McCurry took Afghan Girl in December 1984.A Life Revealed- Afghan Girl, National Geographic It portrays an approximately 12-year-old Pashtun orphan in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp near Peshawar, Pakistan. McCurry found the girl when he heard \\"unexpected laughter\\" coming from children inside a one-room school tent for girls. \\"I noticed this one little girl with these incredible eyes, and I instantly knew that this was really the only picture I wanted to take,\\" he says. This was the first time the girl had ever been photographed. The image was named as \\"the most recognized photograph\\" in the history of the National Geographic magazine, and was used as the cover photograph on the June 1985 issue. The photo has also been widely used on Amnesty International brochures, posters, and calendars. The identity of the \\"Afghan Girl\\" remained unknown for over 17 years until McCurry and a National Geographic team located the woman, Sharbat Gula, in 2002. McCurry said, \\"Her skin is weathered; there are wrinkles now, but she is as striking as she was all those years ago.\\" =Afghan Girl controversy= In 2019, a small but growing vlogger and professional photographer by the name of Tony Northrup released a research documentary accusing McCurry of obtaining the photograph under false pretenses, and endangering Gula's wellbeing in doing so. McCurry's publicity team responded by accusing Northrup of slander, and the clip was removed. Shortly thereafter, however, it was re-uploaded with a number of corrections, with an accompanying document that detailed a number of sources Northrup had obtained. Sharbat Gula herself had also previously provided some commentary on the photograph, published by BBC News in 2017. =Photo manipulation= In 2016 McCurry was accused of extensively manipulating his images with Photoshop and by other means, removing individuals and other elements. In a May 2016 interview with PetaPixel, McCurry did not specifically deny making major changes, indicating that he now defines his work as \\"visual storytelling\\" and as \\"art\\". However, he subsequently added that others print and ship his images while he is travelling, implying that they were responsible for the significant manipulation. \\"That is what happened in this case. It goes without saying that what happened with this image was a mistake for which I have to take responsibility,\\" he concluded. When discussing the issue with a writer for Times Lightbox website, McCurry provided similar comments about being a \\"visual storyteller\\", though without suggesting that the manipulation was done by others without his knowledge. In fact, the Time writer made the following statement, \\"Faced with mounting evidence of his own manipulations, McCurry has been forced to address his position in photography.\\" In neither interview did he discuss when the heavy photo manipulation began, or which images have been manipulated. However, considering the controversy it has created, he said that \\"going forward, I am committed to only using the program in a minimal way, even for my own work taken on personal trips.\\" McCurry also offered the following conclusion to Time Lightbox, \\"Reflecting on the situation … even though I felt that I could do what I wanted to my own pictures in an aesthetic and compositional sense, I now understand how confusing it must be for people who think I'm still a photojournalist.\\"  Awards  * 1987 - Medal of Honor for coverage of the 1986 Philippine Revolution, Philippines, White House News Photographers Association * 1992 - First Place Nature and Environment Oil- Stricken Bird, Kuwait First Place, General News Stories: Kuwait after the Storm Children's Award: \\"Camels Under a Blackened SKy\\", World Press Photo Competition * 1992 - Magazine Feature Picture Award of Excellence: Fiery Aliens First Place, Magazine Science Award: Camels Under A Blackended Sky First Place, Gulf News Sky: Kuwait After the Storm, Picture of the Year Competition * 1992 - Oliver Pebbot Memorial Award: Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad on Golf War Coverage, Overseas Press Club * 1993 - Award of Excellence for Rubble of War, National Press Photographers * 1994 - Arts and Architecture Distinguished Alumni Award, Pennsylvania State University * 1998 - Award of Excellence, Portraits: Red Boy, Picture of the Year Competition * 2002 - Award of Excellence for \\"Women of Afghanistan\\" * 2002 - Photographer of the Year * 2003 - C-recipient of the New York Film Festival God for documentary, Afghan Girl Found * 2003 - The Lucie Award for Photojournalism * 2005 - Photojournalism Division - International Understanding through Photography award, Photographic Society of America * 2006 - First Place, Buddha Rising, National Geographic, National Press Photographers Associate * 2011 - Leica Hall of Fame Award * 2014 - Photography of Appreciation Award * 2018 - Golden Doves for Peace journalistic prize issued by the Italian Research Institute Archivio Disarmo Exhibitions *2015–2016 - Steve McCurry: India, Rubin Museum of Art, New York *2015-2016 - Steve McCurry - Icons and Women, Musei di San Domenico, Forlì, Italy * 2016 - Steve McCurry: The Iconic Photographs, Sundaram Tagore Gallery, Hong Kong * 2016 - The World Through His Lens: Steve McCurry Photographs, New York, United States * 2017 - The World of Steve McCurry, Bussels, Belgium * 2018 - Steve McCurry Icons, Pavia, Italy * 2018 - 'S Wanderful-Making Pictures – Steve McCurry Solo Exhibition, Taipei, Taiwan * 2019 - \\"Le Monde de Steve McCurry\\", La Sucrière, Lyon, France *2019 - \\"Steve's House : permanent exhibition\\" , Kashan, Iran * 2019 - \\"Food\\", Musei di San Domenico, Forlì, Italy Publications      * References External links * *One on One With the Masters of Photography – Interview with McCurry which discuss the techniques of his portrait photography * McCurry's gallery at photographic agency Sud Est57 * 2013 Pirelli Calendar shot by McCurry * Capturing the Face of Asia – Interview with McCurry by European culture and arts online magazine Culturekiosque (2007) * I Visualize Photo Possibilities Wherever I Am - Interview with McCurry by Indian photography web site \\"Fotoflock.com\\" (2009) * – Al Jazeera interview by Riz Khan * \\"It's All Mixed: An Interview with Steve McCurry\\", GUP Magazine (2013) Category:Living people Category:Magnum photographers Category:American photojournalists Category:Photography in Afghanistan Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:Artists from Philadelphia Category:Royal Photographic Society Category:1950 births Category:National Geographic photographers ","title":"Steve McCurry"},{"id":"2146330","text":"Ziri ibn Manad or Ziri son of Mennad (died in 971) was the founder of the Zirid dynasty in the Berber world. Ziri ibn Mennad was a chief of the Takalata branch of the Sanhajah confederation, to which the Kutama Berbers belonged. As an ally of the Fatimids, he assisted in the defeat of the rebellion of Abu Yazid (943–947) by Caliph al-Mansur bi-Nasr Allah, and was rewarded with the governorship of the western provinces, an area that roughly corresponds with modern Algeria north of the Sahara. Ziri had the residence of built south of the future site of Algiers in 935. He summoned masons and joiners from M'sila and Tubna to build the fortress , which once finished was filled with scholars, merchants and lawyers. He minted money and began to pay his troops in cash. His son Buluggin ibn Ziri founded the cities of Algiers, Miliana and Medea (Lamdiya), and rebuilt the settlements destroyed in the revolt. Ziri ibn Manad was killed in battle against the lord of M'sila (Ja'far Ibn 'Ali al- andalusi al-Maghrawi) in June-July 971. He was succeeded as governor by his son Buluggin ibn Ziri, who in 972 became Viceroy of Ifriqiya (972–984) when the Fatimids transferred their court to Egypt.

In what may have been a publicity stunt, she then strode to the on-deck circle, took Babe Herman's bat and proceeded to \\"pinch hit\\". She ended up grounding out to first base; however, the appearance was purely informal, and the umpires did not count this as an official at bat or out, as she was not on the roster.

It was founded in 1876 by the Benedictine monks of Belmont Abbey. The school is affiliated with the Catholic Church and the Order of Saint Benedict. It is endorsed by The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College. Belmont Abbey is the only college in North Carolina affiliated with the Catholic Church. Offering an undergraduate education, the college enrolls students from diverse ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds.  History  St. Benedict Belmont Abbey College was founded in 1876 as St. Mary's College by Benedictine monks from Saint Vincent Archabbey in Pennsylvania. Father Jeremiah O'Connell purchased Caldwell farm and donated the land to the Benedictines, hoping the community would found a Catholic educational institution in the Carolinas. On April 21, 1876, Father Herman Wolfe, from Saint Vincent, arrived with two students to take possession of the property and begin classes. In 1878, the college held its first commencement exercises. Katharine Drexel, a benefactor of the monastery and college, visited Belmont Abbey in 1904. The present name of the college was adopted in 1913. In 1967 John Oetgen, college president and Benedictine priest, conferred an honorary degree on the Protestant evangelist Billy Graham, marking what was at the time seen as a bold ecumenical gesture. Originally a college for young men, Belmont Abbey became a coeducational institution in 1972. Belmont Abbey History In 1987, Sacred Heart College for women merged with the Abbey, and its campus began to host a variety of Abbey classes and programs. The Belmont Abbey Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. It encompasses 14 contributing buildings, 3 contributing sites, 1 contributing structure, and 1 contributing object (a statue of Saint Benedict (1924)). It includes at its heart the separately listed Belmont Abbey Cathedral. Other contributing buildings include the Brothers' Building (1893, 1897, 1904), Old Science (1893), Jubilee Hall (1897), The Monastery (1880, 1891, and 1894), the College Building (or Stowe Hall, 1886, 1888, 1898), Saint Leo Hall (1907), and The Haid (1929).  Campus  Aerial View of Belmont Abbey College Maurus Hall is centrally located on campus and houses a student lounge, grill, and the Holy Grounds coffee shop. Across from Maurus Hall is the Haid, which serves as a student and community theater. The Haid was originally built as a gymnasium. The Abbey Players now perform there. Along Abbey Lane, towards the far end of the campus, are the Vincent Abbot Taylor Library and the William Gaston Science Hall. Administrative offices are located in Robert Stowe Hall, with classrooms on the second and third floors. St. Leo's Hall, built in the American Benedictine style, houses the Campus Book Store and Catholic Shop on the first floor. Professorial offices are located in St. Leo's Hall, and Grace Auditorium is located on the third floor. The quad is located between the Poellath and O'Connell residence halls, both constructed in the early 1960s. Raphael Arthur Hall, constructed in 1967, offers students individual rooms and sits on the hill above Poellath, near Campus Police. The St. Joseph's Eucharistic Adoration Chapel, dedicated in 2008, is across from Campus Police. Wheeler Athletic Center, completed in 1970, is located behind Poellath Hall. At the back of the campus are the four Cuthbert Allen Apartment buildings, built in 1989. The newly renovated Student Commons, located next to the new cafeteria, houses the campus mailroom, snack machines, a lounge area, and Student Life offices. Behind the Student Commons are the St. Scholastica and St. Benedict residence halls. The Lourdes Grotto, an official pilgrimage shrine, is situated behind O'Connell Hall. = Mary Help of Christians Abbey Basilica = The Lourdes Grotto The Abbey Church, the most prominent building on the college's campus, was completed in 1894 under the supervision of Abbot Leo Haid. Drexel made significant donations to the completion of the structure, which served as North Carolina's first and only cathedral prior to the erection of the Diocese of Raleigh in 1924. The church is constructed in the gothic-revival style out of brick and granite, built in the shape of a Latin cross. The towers of the church, named Ora (the taller) and Labora (the smaller), can be seen from most of the college campus. The taller of the two towers holds bells which ring to signal the celebration of the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours. The monastic community continues to hold daily services which are open to the student body and the public. Following the Second Vatican Council, the interior of the Abbey Church was renovated in a modernist style in order to facilitate the liturgical reforms of the era. In 1975, Belmont Abbey lost its territorial status and cathedral rank to the newly created Diocese of Charlotte. In 1998 Pope John Paul II named the Abbey Church a minor basilica in recognition of the historic and aesthetic significance of the structure. = Sacred Heart Campus = The Sisters of Mercy of Belmont reside at Sacred Heart Convent, in downtown Belmont. The convent is located on a campus made up of various organizations including Catherine's House, Holy Angels, and Mercy Heritage Center, archives for the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas. In 1892 the sisters began a finishing school for girls that eventually became a four-year degree institution, Sacred Heart College. Sacred Heart College closed in 1987, and a section of the Sacred Heart College is now rented by Belmont Abbey and called Sacred Heart Campus; classes are offered at Sacred Heart for both traditional and adult degree students. Belmont Abbey continues to offer alumnae services to graduates from Sacred Heart College. = St. Joseph Adoration Chapel = St. Joseph Adoration Chapel The Saint Joseph Adoration Chapel was dedicated on November 7, 2008. It marked the first building project under President Bill Thierfelder. Dr. Thierfelder wanted all that came to the Belmont Abbey College campus, that the college finds its center in Jesus Christ. During the Fall and Spring semesters, the chapel is open 24 hours a day for prayers and the Blessed Sacrament is exposed from 6:00am to 9:00pm. = Expansion = Plans were proposed by the President of the college in 2008 to construct a new residence hall on campus in order to facilitate increased enrollment. Article in the Crusader In the Fall of 2012, construction began on two new residence halls to open in the Fall of 2013. In the Summer of 2011, construction began on a state-of-the-art integrated cafeteria. The construction was complete in time for the new cafeteria to open to the student body beginning in the Fall of 2012.  Academics  Reminder of the college's Aristotelian commitment The Abbey is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and approved by the American Medical Association. Accreditation More than 80 percent of the faculty at Belmont Abbey hold doctoral degrees in their subjects. After completing a core curriculum, students declare a major and concentrate within their chosen areas of study. Academic programs The college's First Year Symposium, required for incoming freshmen, seeks to acclimate new students to college life. Taught by professors from various fields, this course explains the theories of a liberal education and introduces students to the Rule of St. Benedict and the Catholic intellectual tradition.

Kappa Sigma is the only active fraternity on campus, while active sororities are: Tau Kappa Delta, Epsilon Sigma Alpha, Alpha Sigma Pi. = Abbey Players = The Haid containing the student theater Belmont Abbey has a theatre department. The Abbey Players of Belmont Abbey College were founded in 1883, and have been a part of campus life for over a century. At present, the theatre produces six shows a year, representing a wide repertoire of drama, comedy and musicals. Participation in the Abbey Players is open to any interested member of the Belmont Abbey College community, and students, faculty, staff and monks regularly appear together. In addition, it functions as the Belmont Community Theatre, which brings in theatre artists from the surrounding Metrolina area. = Dining = The new campus cafeteria (Built in the summer of 2012) is located on the residential side of campus, next to the Walter Coggins Student Commons. Robert Lee Stowe Hall contains a grill and Holy Grounds coffee shop. = Housing = Incoming freshmen are required to live in either Poellath or O'Connell; two-story single-sex residence halls. Beginning in the Fall of 2013, upperclassmen were given the option to live in the newly built Saint Benedict Hall and Saint Scholastica Hall, single-sex resident halls for males and females respectively. Raphael Arthur Hall provides residents the choice to live in individual rooms. In addition to the five residence halls on campus, upperclassmen are eligible to live in either one of the four on campus Cuthbert Allen apartment buildings or the Cloisters, off-campus apartments in nearby Mount Holly, North Carolina.

Eight faculty members responded by filing complaints to the North Carolina Department of Insurance, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Women's Law Center. The latter threatened a lawsuit on behalf of the eight faculty members, several of whom were allegedly lifelong Catholics. After the student newspaper, The Crusader, published an article in May 2008 pointing out that the Abbey profits from the sale of contraceptives at two convenience stores that lease land from the Abbey, the Abbot responded by stating that: \\"\\"[They] are preponderantly good operations, i.e. 99 percent or more of their business is not problematic, and the employment generation and economic stimulation they provide for the community of Belmont are worth tolerating a small amount of evil.

Maintained by a voluntary team of contributors, the site is dedicated to providing news and information about Half-Life and Half-Life 2, related modifications and other Valve titles. It was founded by Kevin \\"Fragmaster\\" Bowen and was at one point the largest of an array of GameSpy-run gaming websites known as the Planet Network. Following GameSpy's closure, Planet Half-Life seems to have ceased updating. Content Planet Half-Life's content consisted mainly of a news wire on its front page. Stories on updates, patches, press releases and events related to Half-Life and just about anything else concerning Valve are posted on an almost daily basis. These stories are also mirrored in the site's forum for reader comments. In addition to the news, Planet Half-Life hosts extensive, in-depth collections of information regarding Half-Life, Half-Life 2 (along with Portal), Counter- Strike, Team Fortress and Day of Defeat. These sections cover overviews of each game as well as any official expansion packs related to them, as well as going over their storylines, important characters, enemies, weapons, cheats, walkthroughs, and, in the case of the multiplayer games, map overviews and strategies. The information found on these pages is original work drafted by the staff writers and senior editors collectively (although without any individual credits given, unlike other articles found on the site). Other services =Forum= A major feature of Planet Half-Life, and all other planet sites, is its public forum. These forums include boards ranging from general discussion to technical help. In August 2007, the forums changed format to comply with GameSpy's ForumPlanet standard (the IGN SnowBoards system), removing some outdated features and adding many new ones, such as a dynamic news box that streams in late-breaking news from not only PHL, but all other planet sites as well. This also changed the registration process for the forum, from a per-planet account basis to a network-wide, global account basis. At this time Planet Half-Life's sister sites Planet Fortress and CS.net were officially unsupported and their forums were to be merged into PHL's, although this process lasted over a year before it was complete. =Game servers= Planet Half-Life has been running public game servers since 2006, hosting 24/7 map rotations for Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half-Life: Deathmatch, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Team Fortress 2.PHL Public Game Servers page.

The in-universe and real life articles are kept separately, although they can be linked to each other.

Wickham was the oldest son of Joseph Wickham and Abigail Parker of Cutchogue, Long Island, New York. Wickham inherited nearly all of his father's large estate at age 22, including Robins Island. He lived in the Old House in Cutchogue, which was built in 1699. Currently a museum, it is said to be one of the oldest English-style houses still in existence in the USA. Wickham married Mary Goldsmith and had several children. He was the brother (and rival) of Patriot leader Thomas Wickham and the uncle of Federalist attorney John Wickham. In 1751, Wickham was elected as Fence Viewer. He was elected in both 1754 and 1755 as Overseer of the Poor, and in 1763, he received an appointment as justice for the County of Suffolk. He was elected town assessor in 1765 and 1766, then elected nine times to the highest post of local government, town supervisor of the Town of Southold. In addition, he served as a major in the local militia. During the American Revolution, Wickham was known for his pro- Loyalist views. He was kidnapped by Connecticut rebels on December 13, 1777, and placed on parole soon after. He was required to forfeit his property without compensation on October 22, 1779, after a bill of attainder was passed by New York's legislature. He was also banished from the state under threat of death. Wickham was forced to move to Connecticut, where he died. He insisted he was innocent of the charges, but he was never granted a trial. Acts of attainder were banned under the U.S. Constitution, adopted a few years after Wickham's death. Shortly before his death in exile, Wickham wrote: > I have acted consistently and consciously throughout my whole conduct, with > a firm belief there is a future existence, and defy the state to produce one > instance wherein I have acted rigidly, defrauded, or abused one member of > it, although it was in my power. In 1989, several of Wickham's heirs filed a lawsuit to try to regain ownership of Robins Island. Though the lawsuit failed, it discouraged development, and most of the island is now protected by an easement to The Nature Conservancy. Wickham was buried in the Raymond Cemetery in Waterford, Connecticut.

Pierre Eugène Onfroy de Bréville (21 February 1861 – 24 September 1949) was a French composer. Biography Pierre de Bréville was born in Bar-le-Duc, Meuse. Following the wishes of his parents, he studied law with the goal of becoming a diplomat. However, he abandoned his plans after a few years and entered the Conservatoire de Paris. He began his musical studies with Théodore Dubois (1880–1882), later taking courses under the direction of César Franck. He became a professor, teaching counterpoint at the Schola Cantorum in Paris (1898–1902). Following a twelve-year break, he taught classes in chamber music composition at the Conservatoire de Paris (1914–1918). He established himself as a music critic and became well known for his reviews and commentary in Mercure de France, Le Courrier musical and La Revue blanche. He died in Paris. Although de Bréville was not prolific, he lavished attention to his own compositions, producing several highly original works remembered for their quality.

The game was released in North America on October 31, 1999 and was re-released for the Sony Greatest Hits line-up in 2000. Like the previous installment, it wasn't released in the PAL regions. Twisted Metal 4 is the fourth installment in the Twisted Metal series and the second and last installment to be developed by 989 Studios. The game's plot centers on Sweet Tooth, the long-time mascot of the titular Twisted Metal competition, overthrowing Calypso, the mysterious organizer of the competition, in a coup d'état. He then takes over the mantle of granting the winner of the competition a single wish, regardless of price, size or even reality. Twisted Metal 4 received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who considered it to be an improvement over the previous Twisted Metal III, particularly in terms of level design. Gameplay In concept, Twisted Metal 4 is a demolition derby which permits the usage of ballistic projectiles. Players choose a vehicle and an arena—or a series of arenas in the story mode—to engage in battle with opposing drivers. A variety of weapons are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage. The objective of the game is to be the last one standing. The game's plot takes a different turn of events compared to its predecessors. Its intro video details the tournament's story, starting around the 1900s as a circus-type caravan that traveled across the country spreading destruction everywhere. A young Sweet Tooth finds himself amazed by the contest and runs off in its pursuit, entering and eventually winning. As his wish, he desires to become the star of Twisted Metal, which Calypso gladly grants. At first revered by the chaos he created, as time went on Sweet Tooth became jealous of Calypso, until he decides to initiate a coup d'état helped by a group of midget clowns, and takes control of Twisted Metal. It is also discovered that Calypso's source of powers comes from a mysterious ring that consumes the souls of those who die, increasing his strength and youth, and Sweet Tooth having taken it, finds that he possess the same abilities as Calypso to grant wishes. He tends to cheat people with their wishes like Calypso does as well. Development After a contractual dispute with the developer of the first two games in the series, SingleTrac, Twisted Metal development duties were handed over to Sony's in- house development team, 989 Studios. In development of Twisted Metal III, the source code and physics engine for Twisted Metal 2 weren't available because they were property of SingleTrac. Therefore, new ones had to be created from scratch instead. The new source code introduced advanced physics simulation and AI techniques to the series. In development of Twisted Metal 4, the game was reworked to improve upon the shortcomings of Twisted Metal III, introducing smoother gameplay and softer physics. Levels were expanded further and an increased arsenal of weapons was created which would ultimately become exclusive to this game. Characters The game includes a total of 13 selectable characters from the start. Most characters were original characters created for the game, whereas a few of the returning characters appear as stage bosses without story. Unlike previous games in the series, each stage counts with its own boss (two bosses in The Oil Rig) to defeat in order to advance. Every boss becomes selectable after defeating the story mode at least once. The musician Rob Zombie is included in the playable characters due to the large amount of his songs on the previous installment in the series, Twisted Metal III. Reception Twisted Metal 4 received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 68.04% on GameRankings. Brian of Game Revolution considered the game to be an improvement over Twisted Metal III and noted that the level design has improved from the previous installment, but cited some unsatisfactory levels and physics problems and the repetitive soundtrack as negative points. Joe Fielder of GameSpot also said that the game was a \\"huge leap\\" ahead of Twisted Metal III, commenting on the improved level design, control and physics, but remarked that the latter two \\"remain a little too touchy and unforgiving\\" and that the graphics, while \\"prettier\\" than those of Twisted Metal III, \\"aren't nearly as sharp as the graphics in its current main competitor - Activision's Vigilante 8: Second Offense\\". Marc Nix of IGN commented negatively on the \\"toy car\\" control, look and sound of the vehicles, but noted the \\"colorful\\" graphics and \\"well-done\\" interactive environments.
