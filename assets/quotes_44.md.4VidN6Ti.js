It is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. The first church on the site, with the same dedication, was made of wood and known as the Franciscans' Church (Biserica Franciscanilor). A 1753 document, issued during the reign of Prince Matei Ghica, noted that a Catholic church had stood in Ia»ôi since the founding of Moldavia. In 1741, Grigore II Ghica donated two vineyards to the church. Three years later, Stanislau Jezierski, the Catholic bishop of BacƒÉu, noted that the church was small and ready to collapse. Rebuilt in 1763, it was destroyed by fire in 1766. The church was rebuilt in brick starting in 1782, and was blessed in 1789. The ceiling fell during the 1802 Vrancea earthquake, prompting repairs. The fire of 1827, which affected much of the city, destroyed the roof, again necessitating work. In 1861, the priest Ioan Eugeniu Zapolski restored and expanded the church. In 1869, upon the request of Bishop Giuseppe Salandari, the interior was painted by a Franciscan friar from Italy. Salandari was buried in the church upon his death in 1873, as were eleven other bishops and priests. The south wall of the church features a sundial that seemingly dates to 1813. Until the early 19th century, the building was used as a monastery, and was the center of the Franciscan mission. It became a cathedral when the Ia»ôi Diocese was set up in 1884. Built in the Baroque style, the church has a single cylindrical spire, tall and supple, above the entrance; this is also the bell tower. The exterior is plastered with stone dust, but has no special ornamentation. The interior features three marble altars. There is a classical organ with 21 sonic registers, made in Austria. Work on the much larger Our Lady Queen of Ia»ôi Cathedral began in the 1990s, and the older building was relegated to a parish church in 2005, when the new cathedral was inaugurated.

She helped open up new roles for nurses in mental health work, and demonstrated that they could be equal partners in a team, taking personal responsibility for patient care while collaborating with doctors and playing an important part in new developments in therapeutic treatment. While also taking a lead in education, administration and policy development, she did research and published in medical and nursing journals, and was a member of key committees in her field.  Early life and education  Flora Eileen Skellern was born on 14 June 1923 in Stone, Staffordshire to Flora (n√©e Poole) and Willis Arthur Skellern, a commercial traveller. After attending Retford High School for Girls in Nottinghamshire she went to train as a nurse at Leeds General Infirmary, qualified in 1944, and worked there, first as a staff nurse, then in 1946 as a sister on a ward where there were some psychiatric patients.David H. Russell, ‚ÄòSkellern, (Flora) Eileen (1923‚Äì1980)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004  The Cassel and Belmont hospitals  The Cassel Hospital in 2013. Her introduction to nursing psychiatric patients in Leeds made her interested in modern psychological approaches to care of the mentally unwell. The Cassel Hospital by Ham Common, London had a reputation for treating patients in a therapeutic environment and she moved there in 1948 to follow their recently developed course in psychosocial treatment and nursing for nervous disorders. Skellern joined the Cassel Social Therapy Unit as a permanent staff member in 1949. There she worked with Tom Main on pioneering psychotherapeutic and psychosocial treatments. During her time at the Cassel she underwent psychoanalysis herself and observers said she found it easier to collaborate with analytically-inclined doctors and nurses.Winship, Bray, Repper and Hinshelwood, 'Collective biography and the legacy of Hildegard Peplau, Annie Altschul and Eileen Skellern; the origins of mental health nursing and its relevance to the current crisis in psychiatry', Journal of Research in Nursing, November 2009 pp505-517 In 1952‚Äì53 she wrote a report for the Royal College of Nursing, The Role of the Ward Sister. It was based on numerous visits to hospitals and was funded by a scholarship grant given for a study of the ‚Äúpractical application to ward administration of modern methods in the instruction and handling of staff and student nurses‚Äù.Marjorie Simpson, 'The Royal College of Nursing of the United Kingdom 1916‚Äì1976: role and action in a changing health service', Journal of Advanced Nursing, 1977 It was \\"the first serious piece of nursing research done in England by a psychiatric nurse\\". In 1953 she went to the Belmont Hospital, Sutton to be sister in charge of its Social Rehabilitation Unit catering for 100 patients. Here the psychiatrist was Maxwell Jones. Together they developed therapeutic community initiatives which laid the foundations for significant advances in psychiatric nursing. Skellern established that interactions with nurses could be crucial in preparing patients to return to their home communities. As well as supporting rehabilitation through one-to-one relationships, nurses could undertake family and group work. Skellern and Jones worked with others to develop group methods for helping patients return to society.David Russell, Eileen Skellern ‚Äì A Biographical essay They proceeded as equals in forming conclusions about their therapies and treatments. Both published articles about their work, and Skellern's papers have been described as giving a \\"definitive picture of the new developments in psychiatric nursing in the 1950s\\". She herself was \\"prominent\\" in \\"laying the foundation of [this] style of psycho-social nursing\\".Miss Eileen Skellern (obituary), The Times, 19 August 1980, p12 While she was in charge she collaborated with a team of anthropologists and social scientists who were studying the Unit. It became the Henderson Hospital not long after Skellern left, and the Jones-Skellern ideas were carried forward there.Henderson Hospital  Later career  Bethlem Royal Hospital in 2011 From 1957 to 1959 she studied at the Royal College of Nursing to qualify as a registered nurse teacher (RNT) and worked as sister tutor for the next two years at St Bartholomew's Hospital. She went to Cheadle Royal Hospital in Cheshire to qualify as a registered mental nurse (RMN). From then on Skellern was always based in the London area and moved to the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley in 1963 to be Superintendent of Nursing, a post to which she had been appointed before her studies in Cheshire. Here she helped establish a therapeutic community unit; she was rarely \\"far away from the idea of therapeutic communities\\" despite the many different aspects of her work. She was a good teacherDennie Briggs, A Life Well Lived: Maxwell Jones ‚Äì a Memoir, Jessica Kingsley Publishers 2002, p21 and was innovative in developing curricula for psychiatric nurse education using group methods. The students' clinical experience was central to their training and was explicitly linked to their classroom work. This approach was in tune with that of Elliott Jaques, professor of social sciences at Brunel University, whose students went on industrial placements as part of their course. Jacques and Skellern collaborated on the first course ever to combine nursing with social sciences, and developed a joint nursing certificate and degree course which, from 1968, was offered half at the Maudsley and half at Brunel. Another educational innovation was also a collaboration: this time with Isaac Marks of the Institute of Psychiatry. In 1973 he and Skellern set up a behavioural psychotherapy course for experienced nurses, which has been seen as an important step in recognising the potential of nurses to act as therapists. Skellern's title of Superintendent changed to Chief Nursing Officer in 1972 as NHS management was restructured. She used her leadership and experience to support colleagues, and was seen as a fair manager with a warm manner and an understanding of the needs of hospital clinical staff at all levels. She took on a considerable amount of committee work including work for the King's Fund health think tank, and membership of a working party chaired by the secretary of state for health Richard Crossman investigating problems in closed institutions for the mentally handicapped. Since Crossman's advisor, Brian Abel-Smith, was a friend she was able to make valuable contributions in private as well as more publicly.Sally Sheard, The Passionate Economist: How Brian Abel-Smith shaped global health and social welfare, Policy Press 2013, p237 She was awarded an OBE in 1972, the year the resulting report was published. In the 1970s she developed cancer but continued to work as much as she could until taking early retirement in 1980, not long before she died on 29 July. In September of that year the first International Psychiatric Nursing Congress was held, an event which she had been planning for two years. Two days before she died she learned that she had been made a Fellow of the Royal College of Nursing.Fellows of the RCN ‚Äì roll of honour An Eileen Skellern Memorial Lecture series in her honour began in 1982. Among the speakers in the 1980s were Annie Altschul and Caroline Cox.'Skellern Lecture and the Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing Lifetime Achievement Award 2015', Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 2015, 22, pp223‚Äì225 From 2006 the lecture has been the occasion for the presentation of a Lifetime Achievement Award, with recipients including Jo Brand, Helen Bamber, Shirley Smoyak and Malcolm Rae. She has also been recognised by having a new building at the Maudsley named after her: the only nurse to have been remembered in this way.

According to Salas and Pauletto (1938), Eduardo Caba's mother was his first music teacher.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. In 1926, he moved to Buenos Aires and completed his higher studies in harmony.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. There he attended the classes of the Argentinean composer Felipe Boero. In 1927, he obtained a scholarship by the Bolivian government allowing him to improve his skills in Madrid where he was the alumnus of Joaqu√≠n Turina and of P√©rez Casas.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit.See biografiasyvidas.com. However, the Bolivian government withdrew its commitment and Caba was forced to give up his studies.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. Shortly later, Caba returned to Buenos Aires and integrated into Argentinean society, where he made good friends.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. His reputation grew, and his works were played at the Teatro Col√≥n.Article by El√≠as Blanco Mamani, elias-blanco.blogspot. In 1942, Caba moved from Buenos Aires to his home country after being appointed director of the National Conservatory of Music of La Paz.Article by Alfredo Sol√≠z B√©jar, Pentagrama del Recuerdo.com.Compositores bolivianos in biografiascompbolivia. He also lived for two years in Montevideo with his family.Article by Rey Gonz√°lez dans LaRaz√≥n, 2015, La Paz, Bolivia. From the outset of his career Caba won the praise of the renowned Spanish musicologist Adolfo Salazar, as Salas and Pauletto underscores, citing Salazar's comments in his book M√∫sica y m√∫sicos de hoy (1928) as well as his articles in the Spanish journal El Sol.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. His compositions were interpreted at the La Revue musicale in Paris by the pianist Ricardo Vi√±es, one of the most active promoters of Caba's works, and the French composer and founder of the Revue, Henry Pruni√®res, considered Caba as one of the most important representatives of values in Latin America.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. Ninon Vallin, the French soprano who often stayed in Buenos Aires and was present at twenty seasons of the Teatro Col√≥n, has also interpreted Caba's works. Other promoters of the music of Caba include Beatriz Balzi and Mariana Alandia.  Style  The musicologists Salas and Pauletto consider Caba as an \\"intuitive composer with the vernacular motives of his homeland\\".See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. The vernacular aspects are probably the most characteristic of Caba's musical language. But the intuitive character of Caba's work is probably the most interesting, and it is interesting to understand the origin of this \\"intuition\\". Salas and Pauletto, who knew personally Eduardo Caba, explain it in the following way: A representative example of Caba's music is his dance Kollavina, recently interpreted by the Bolivian guitarist Marcos Pu√±a, and presented in the book of the two aforementioned musicologists.See Samuel J.A.

As a two-year-old he was highly tried, running nine times. After winning a maiden race in May he was placed in the Coventry Stakes, Railway Stakes and Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re before recording a 20/1 upset victory in the Dewhurst Stakes. He failed to win in two starts in 2009 and was retired from racing. He has hsd some success as a breeding stallion. Background Intense Focus is a bay horse with a small white star and a white sock on his left hind leg bred in Kentucky Robert N Clay of Three Chimneys Farm & the Airlie Stud. The colt was sent to Ireland and put up for auction at the Goffs Million sale in October 2007. He was bought for ‚Ç¨340,000 by the trainer Jim Bolger. The colt raced in the ownership of Jim Bolger's wife Jackie, in partnership with John Corcoran. He was trained throughout his racing career by Jim Bolger in County Carlow and was ridden in all but one of his races by Kevin Manning. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Giant's Causeway who was voted Cartier Horse of the Year in 2000, a year in which he won the St James's Palace Stakes, Eclipse Stakes, Sussex Stakes, International Stakes, Irish Champion Stakes. He later became a very successful breeding stallion in the United States, siring major winners including Footstepsinthesand, Ghanaati, Shamardal and Rite of Passage. Intense Focus's dam Daneleta won one race from seven starts and finished third in the Railway Stakes. Her dam Zavaleta won the Athasi Stakes and was a half-sister to the Gran Criterium winner Sholokhov and Affianced, the dam of Soldier of Fortune. As a descendant of the British broodmare Fanghorn she was also related to the outstanding sprinter Double Form. Racing career =2008: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Intense Focus contested a six furlong maiden race on soft ground at the Curragh on 5 May and finished fourth of the fifteen runners behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Mastercraftsman. Three weeks later, on firmer ground, the colt started 5/2 favourite for a maiden over the same course and distance. He took an early lead but then settled in third place before going to the front again two furlongs out. He stayed on strongly in the closing stages and won by a neck from Super Pistachio, a colt who went on to win the Champagne Stakes. Intense Focus was moved up in class and sent to England for the Group Two Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot on 17 June in which he finished second, two and a quarter lengths behind Art Connoisseur who later won the Golden Jubilee Stakes. The other beaten horses included two other horses who went on to win major races later in the year: Lord Shanakill won the Mill Reef Stakes whilst Square Eddie won the Breeders' Futurity. Twelve days later, in the Railway Stakes at the Curragh, Intense Focus finished third in a three-way photo-finish, beaten a short-head and a neck by Mastercraftsman and Alhaban after briefly taking the lead in the last quarter mile. In the Anglesey Stakes at the Curragh on 13 July he finished fifth of the seven runners, beaten seven lengths by the subsequent Middle Park Stakes winner Bushranger. After a break of two months, Intense Focus returned in the National Stakes on heavy ground at the Curragh on 14 September. He started a 16/1 outsider and made little impression, finishing sixth of the seven runners behind Mastercraftsman. In this race he was equipped with blinkers for the first time and wore them in all his subsequent starts. Two weeks later the colt contested a valuable sales race restricted to horses sold at the Goffs Million sale. With Manning taking the ride on the Bolger stable's most-fancied contender Gan Amhras, Intense Focus was ridden by Danny Morgan and started at odds of 20/1. He finished third of the eighteen runners beaten half a length and a length the British-trained Soul City and Gan Amhras. On his next appearance, the colt was sent to France for the Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October. Starting a 16/1 outsider he finished third behind Naaqoos and Milanais with Mastercraftsman in fourth. On 18 October, Intense Focus made his second appearance in England, when he contested Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. The Aidan-O'Brien-trained Rip Van Winkle started the 6/4 favourite whilst Intense Focus was a 20/1 outsider. Soul City and Lord Shanakill were again in opposition, whilst the other nine runners included Ashram (Somerville Tattersall Stakes), Delegator, Shaweel (Gimcrack Stakes) and Finjaan (Molecomb Stakes). After tracking the leaders, Intense Focus took the lead a furlong out and was drive out by Manning as he faced several late challengers. In a \\"blanket finish\\" he prevailed by a nose from Lord Shanakill with Finjaan a nose away in third and Shaweel another half a length back in fourth. Delegator, Ashram and Rip Van Winkle also finished within two lengths of the winner. After the race Manning said \\"It was very close, and I wasn't 100 per cent sure [that he had won]. He travelled well and got there and kept going. He's kept progressing and he likes this quick ground\\". Bolger commented \\"He's a hardy horse. He was four kilos heavier today than in Paris and we just kept him ticking over\\". =2009: three-year-old season= Intense Focus began his second season in the Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes over one mile on 29 March. He started the eve money favourite in a five-runner field but after taking the lead in the last quarter mile he was overtaken and beaten a lengths by Recharge, to whom he was conceding three pounds in weight. Plans to run the colt in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains were abandoned after rain softened the ground in France. He did not reappear until June when he contested the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Starting at odds of 12/1 he finished fifth of the ten runners behind Mastercraftsman. Stud record After his retirement from racing, Intense Focus became a breeding stallion at the Ballylinch Stud in County Kilkenny. In his first season, he sired Astaire who won the Middle Park Stakes in 2013. In 2016 he was standing at a fee of ‚Ç¨5,000.

True is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at Alliant International University in San Francisco, CA. She is recognized for her efforts to advance mental health services for Asian Americans and other minorities. She conducts research studies examining mental attitudes and status among minorities in the community, and publishes her research in reputable psychological journals. Early life in Japan True was born in Japan to a large family in 1933. True grew up in Niigata, Japan. Her family moved to Shanghai during World War II, following her father who served as a civilian in the Japanese Army. At the end of the war her family returned to Niigata.Moritsugu, D. (2014). Diversity Within Diversity: Prominent Psychologists of Color. [online] YouTube. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc2W3q02RQg [Accessed 18 May. 2017]. When True was 17 years old, 1950, her mother died as a result of a domestic violence incident.Homma-True, Reiko (2017). Feminist Psychology and Psychotherapy: A Personal Journey. Women & Therapy, 40(3-4), 427-441. During high school she was involved with community activities through her church, volunteering in orphanages, prisons and senior centers. She was accepted to a university in Tokyo in 1949. She was part of only the 3rd year of women being accepted into the college. She was one of only three women in her class of eighty students. She double majored in International Relations and English. Reiko True was unable to find a job after she competed her studies and shared that this was the first time she had encountered discrimination because she was female. Life in the United States In the spring of 1958, True moved to San Francisco, CA. She applied and was accepted to the Social Work graduate program at University of California, Berkeley. In 1964, she graduated and began working at a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Oakland, CA. There, she met a supervisor named Mary Edwards (otherwise known as Mary Goulding), who got True involved in activist work. Initially, True focused on Japanese newcomer women who were married to American servicemen. She noticed that they \\"were often isolated and had trouble adjusting to the [United States].\\" Working with a Japanese social worker, she established a self-help support group for these women called the Himawari (sunflower) group. Afterward, she continued to work with other activists to create and advocate for health, mental health, and social service agencies for Asian American communities. In 1972, True decided to return to graduate school at the California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP). She received funding from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and was able to study psychology with a focus on minority mental health issues. During her time at CSPP, she began meeting with a group of like-minded Asian American women. In 1976, they decided to start teaching the Psychology of Asian American Women as an Asian American Studies course at UC Berkeley. After finishing her graduate studies at CSPP, True joined the Region IX office of NIMH in San Francisco where she worked to help community groups and the local governments of Nevada and Arizona develop community mental health centers. She worked there for five years and decided to accept a position as Deputy Director at San Francisco Community Mental Health Services in order to continue working with local community groups. In 1985, she was appointed to the position of Director of Community Mental Health Services and Substance Abuse Services. Career True's career, which spans over 25 years, has been devoted to the advancement of minority affairs. True was one of the proponents of cultural and linguistic appropriate mental health services in the California bay area. In 1996, she retired from the Public Health department. For the following nine years, she trained master's level psychology students as part of the Clinical Psychology Master's Program in Tokyo, Japan. She currently practices psychology part-time in San Francisco, CA. Her practice caters to non-English speaking populations and minorities from Japan Town in San Francisco. Besides her career as a practicing clinical psychologist, True has served the psychological community in many ways. She served on the Community on Women in 2012, she was the first female director of the Mental Health Substance Abuse and Forensic Services for the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the President of the Asian American Psychological Association from 1997‚Äì1999, and she served the Asian American Community Mental Health Program in Oakland, CA.

Humanitarian efforts True worked extensively in developing and training others in mental health disaster assistance. She helped organize disaster mental health assistance for the residents of San Francisco after San Francisco was hit by the Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1989. Later, she went to Japan to provide mental health assistance to disaster victims after the Kansai-Awaji Earthquake in 1995. For six months, she trained mental health professionals on disaster mental health assistance as a visiting Fulbright Senior Scholar at Kobe University Medical School. Similarly, she later worked with the Japanese Community and Cultural Center of Northern California (JCCCNC) to train Japanese disaster workers in San Francisco in disaster mental health assistance. She continued with her disaster assistance work in 2011 after the Tohoku Region Disaster when she organized mental health disaster training for a select group of workers from the affected Tohoku region. Research contributions True's research focus is on different minority groups such as the Asian American, Japanese American, and other South East Asian communities that exist within the United States. Her research includes examining privacy and confidentiality as it relates to psychotherapy. Among the focuses of the study were the procedures in place that govern how informed consent is obtained and the federal requirements for guarding confidentiality. The study also looked at third-party insurance, specifically Medicaid, and how insurance records are kept and whether or not those records are more vulnerable than other institutions with access to confidential information. The study found weak points in the safety of patient confidential information and made recommendations for professional conduct regarding confidentiality as it relates to psychotherapy as a result.Everstine, L., Everstine, D. S., Heymann, G. M., True, R. H., Frey, D. H., Johnson, H. G., & Seiden, R. H. (1980). Privacy and confidentiality in psychotherapy. American Psychologist, 35(9), 828. True also contributed to an interview sample survey of adult residents of San Francisco's China Town. The researchers studied Chinese Americans' use of mental health services and discovered that although the prevalence of mental health disorders in China Town was high, only 5% of participants indicated they had utilized any mental health services. The study found that this phenomenon was not caused by negative stereotypes surrounding mental illness, but rather, Chinese Americans' unawareness of the services available.Loo, C., Tong, B., & True, R.

Location Conservation units in the Purus-Madeira interfluvial. 17\\\\. Matupiri Sustainable Development Reserve The Matupiri Sustainable Development Reserve is in the municipality of Borba, Amazonas. It has an area of . The reserve is in the basin of the Madeira River. The Cunh√£-Sapucaia Indigenous Territory adjoins the reserve to the north. To the east it adjoins the Matupiri State Park. To the south it adjoins the Rio Madeira Sustainable Development Reserve. The Matupiri River crosses the western portion of the reserve from southwest to northeast and then forms part of the boundary between the reserve and the Cunh√£-Sapucaia Indigenous Territory. History The Matupiri Sustainable Development Reserve was created by decree 28423 of 27 March 2009. It was one of five conservation units created to meet some of the environmental licensing requirements for the work to upgrade the BR-319 highway from Porto Velho to Manaus, which was suspended by Carlos Minc, the Minister of the Environment. Minc defended what he called a \\"green pocket\\" around the highway. Construction of roads in the forests elsewhere had often encouraged deforestation, with a \\"herringbone\\" pattern of logging roads radiating from the highway. Thus the paving of BR-163 from Cuiab√°, Mato Grosso to Santar√©m, Par√° had increased deforestation in the area by 500%. The state- level conservation units in the BR-319 corridor are the Piaga√ßu-Purus, Rio Amap√°, Rio Madeira, Igap√≥-A√ßu, and Matupiri sustainable development reserves, Canutama Extractive Reserve, Canutama State Forest, Tapau√° State Forest, and Matupiri State Park. In December 2012 the Amazonas state government allocated more than R$6 million to these nine units, covering and 143 communities, to be coordinated by the State Center for Conservation Units (CEUC). The funding was for development of management plans, creation of management councils, environmental monitoring, land survey, and production and marketing. The management plan for the Matupiri Sustainable Development Reserve was approved on 22 July 2014.

Wetlands are areas within floodplains with both terrestrial and aquatic characteristics, including marshes, swamps, bogs, and others. It has been estimated that they occupy around 2.8x106 km2, about 2.2% of the earth‚Äôs surface, but other estimates are even higher.Reddy, K.R., E.M. D'Angelo, and W.G. Harris. 2000 Biogeochemistry of Wetlands. In CRC Press. Handbook of Soil Science. Editor- in-Chief, M.E. Sumner. pp. G89-119 It has also been estimated to have a worth of $14.9 trillion and are responsible for 75% of commercial and 90% of recreational harvest of fish and shellfish in the United States. Wetlands also hold an important role in water purification, storm protection, industry, travel, research, education, and tourism. Being heavily used and traveled through, dredging is common and leads to continuation of long-term damage of the ecosystem and land loss, and ultimately a loss in industry, homes, and protection. Wetlands undergo different chemical reactions depending on a variety of parameters, including salinity and pH. Redox reactions have a major effect on wetland ecosystems, as they depend heavily on salinity, pH, oxygen availability, and others. Common redox reactions in wetland include carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur transformations. Fluctuations in water flow and flooding can change the abundance of the oxidized or reduced species depending on the environment. Increased flooding and water flow can also change the availability of nutrients to local species. The further the wetlands change from their original states, the more difficult rebuilding land becomes. The types of mitigation efforts also change depending on the chemistry, so an understanding of the change is required for effective mitigation.  Wetlands  = Definition = Wetlands are areas of land submerged in water near both terrestrial and aquatic systems. They are highly diverse and are classified by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service into five categories: ‚ÄúThe term wetland includes a variety of areas that fall into one of five categories: (1) areas with hydrophytes and hydric soils, such as those commonly known as marshes, swamps, and bogs; (2) areas without hydrophytes but with hydric soils - for example, flats where drastic fluctuation in water level, wave action, turbidity, or high concentration of salts may prevent the growth of hydrophytes; (3) areas with hydrophytes but nonhydric soils, such as margins of impoundments or excavations where hydrophytes have become established but hydric soils have not yet developed; (4) areas without soils but with hydrophytes such as the seaweed-covered portion of rocky shores; and (5) wetlands without soil and without hydrophytes, such as gravel beaches or rocky shores without vegetation‚Äù. Wetlands can also be classified based on salinity, a type of classification often referenced in research where salinity is a major factor. These classifications are often referred to in parts per thousand (ppt) and include freshwater (0-2 ppt), intermediate (2-10 ppt), brackish (10-20 ppt), and saltwater (20+ ppt). = Importance of wetlands = Wetlands are sources of extreme biodiversity and ecological benefit. They contain a multitude of species of plants and animals, including 79 species classified as rare, threatened, or endangered. An estimate by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service indicates that wetlands provide for, directly and indirectly, up to 43% of federally threatened or endangered species. Wetlands are the leading producer of oysters, 50% of the shrimp crop, 75% of the alligator harvest, 27% of the oil and gas, and the largest port complex in the United States. The world‚Äôs wetlands have an estimated worth of $14.9 trillion. Wetlands also provide for disaster protection, including surge protection from hurricanes, as they and barrier islands help to break down the power of a storm before it reaches mainland. They also provide flood relief, as they are able to hold about three-acre feet (one million gallons) of water. This holding of water allows for rejuvenation of ecosystems, as new sediment is able to settle. Flooding also affects factors such as root penetration, soil temperature, conductivity, and bulk density. Wetlands are highly effective at removing pollutants and excess nutrients due to the slow water flow and absorption by the plant systems. This has been shown to be effective in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus, the major nutrients involved in ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù. They are also major sinks for heavy metals and sulfur. An example of a canal being dredged. = Dredging = Dredging is the removal of sediment, plant species, and debris from an aquatic area. Industry, travel, and recreation throughout wetlands often requires the dredging of canals, especially by oil industry to get out to their offshore drills through coastal wetlands. Canals widen after being dredged because of the increased water flow and loss of plant life, both attributing to increased erosion. It is estimated that there are 4,572 miles of canals south of the Intracoastal Waterway, not including Lake Ponchartrain and Lake Maurepas, and that canals alone attribute to 6.53 square miles of land loss per year in the United States. The permits required to dredge these canals include stipulations of refilling, but these are not often enforced. John M. Barry, along with a group of private lawyers and coastal experts, filed a lawsuit in 2013 against 97 corporations who had violated their permits in Louisiana‚Äôs coastal wetlands in response to this. It is referred to as ‚Äúthe most ambitious environmental lawsuit ever‚Äù by the New York Times and has been met with political resistance.  Wetland dredging chemistry  Canal dredged in a wetland area. Wetlands are dynamic systems that undergo a variety of chemical reactions depending greatly on the specific physicochemical properties of the area, such as temperature, pressure, dissolved organic matter, pH, salinity, and dissolved gases (CO2 and O2). The qualities that have the largest effect are salinity and pH. An increase in flooding (a result of dredging) increases the salinity of wetlands, as it allows saltwater to intrude, neutralizes the pH, and provides more anaerobic soil conditions. The conditions then effect the nutrient availability and redox reactions. = Redox reactions = Redox reactions are highly influential in wetland soil chemistry through transformations including those of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen. The abundance of oxygen changes the abundance of oxidized or reduced states of each compound. Areas of higher oxygen availability (aerobic) tend towards oxidized states and areas of low oxygen availability (anaerobic) tend towards reduced states. The abundance of each type results in a different ecosystem, as the plants and animals of the wetlands require specific conditions for their growth. Common wetland redox reactions include: > ¬ó2NO3‚àí +10e‚àí +12H+ ‚Üí N2 +6H2O > ¬óSO4 +8e‚àí +9H+ ‚Üí HS‚àí +4H2O > ¬óCO2 +8e‚àí +8H+ ‚Üí CH4 \\\\+ 2H2O > ¬óMnO2 +2e‚àí +4H+ ‚Üí Mn2+ \\\\+ 2H2O > ¬óFe(OH)3 +e‚àí +3H+ ‚Üí Fe3+ \\\\+ 3H2O Dredging allows for an increased flow of water through wetlands, causing anaerobic soil conditions. This change in wetland type results in a change in redox state for each reaction undergone and thus changes the plant species available to grow in those areas. The redox potential (Eh) can help to show the relationship of the redox reactions through the Nernst equation: > Eh=E0-(RT/nF)ln([Reductants]a/[Oxidants]b[H+]b) This equation allows for the calculation of the extent of reaction between two redox systems and can be used, for example, to decide whether a particular reaction will go to completion or not. An example of a change in these circumstances affecting the wetland system is in the transformation of pyrite (FeS2) through the reduction of SO42‚àí (found in seawater). > Fe(OH)3 \\\\+ e‚àí \\\\+ H+ ‚Üí Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ H2O > SO42‚àí \\\\+ 6e‚àí \\\\+ 8H+ ‚Üí S + 4H2O > S + 2e‚àí \\\\+ 2H+ ‚Üí H2S > Fe(OH)2 \\\\+ H2S ‚Üí FeS + 2H2O > FeS + S ‚Üí FeS2 (pyrite) The drainage of the resulted pyrite then results in oxidation to ferric hydroxide and sulfuric acid, causing extreme acidity (pH < 2). = Nutrient availability = Coastal land Increased flooding also allows for saltwater intrusion, changing the salinity levels and killing off species of plants that normally grew and changing available nutrient, chemical, and oxygen levels as well. An increase in salinity leads to higher sulfate concentrations and higher sulfide emissions, and higher toxicity. It also results in a reduction of sulfur availability to plant species as it precipitates with trace metals such as zinc and copper. An example of this is Ferrous sulfide (FeS), which gives wetland soils their black color and is the source of sulfur commonly found in coal deposits. Flooding also results in pH neutralization of generally acidic (with exceptions) wetlands. Acidic wetlands inhibit denitrification, thus flooding allows denitrification to occur, resulting in a loss of gaseous nitrogen forms to the atmosphere. The reaction is shown below: > 5C6H12O6 +24NO3‚àí +24H+ ‚Üí 30CO2 +12N2 +42H2O Anaerobic soil conditions brought on by flooding allows for precipitation of phosphates with ferric iron and aluminum (acidic soils) or calcium and magnesium (basic soils) resulting in phosphorus being unavailable for uptake in plant species.  Importance of wetland chemistry  As the environment is altered through physical means (dredging), the occurring reactions change resulting in a decrease of the availability of nutrients and chemical species to plant species and the ecosystem. This then further changes the physical environment as these species are no longer able to survive. The loss of species then results in further changes to the chemical environment, as they are no longer present to remove excess nutrients. This also changes the physical environment further as the lack of survival of plant species results in open land and increased erosion. The change of the chemical environment also affects the mitigation techniques to be applied for rebuilding of wetlands as the survival of plant species that could potentially be planted depends on the chemical environment, and changes must be monitored for effective mitigation to take place.

The procedure measures chlorine, bromine, and iodine as equivalent halogens, but does not measure fluorine levels in the sample.  Background  Utilization of halogen containing materials in processes such as water treatment, bleaching, or even general synthesis to create the final product, generates a number of organic halides. These organic halides are released in wastewater from the oil, chemical, and paper industries, and find their way to the consumer and eventually to a landfill or oceanic dumps. Within the soil, the halo compounds resist degradation and often react with metal ions, resulting in non-degradable metal complexes, increasing soil toxicity and accumulating in the food chain of aquatic organisms. Up to 2000 ppm of these bio- accumulative organic chlorides were detected in fat of fish from the waters where bleaching effluents were disposed by paper mills, where a 2% water concentration is considered toxic for the fish. While strict regulations from the government have reduced the high level of past emissions, these compounds find their way to water sources through improper consumer disposal of items that contain chlorinated compounds. The presence of any organic halides in natural water has been considered an indication of contamination with xenobiotics. Once in water, the naturally occurring fulvic acids and humic acids can lead to formation of mutagenic compounds such as halogenated furanone MX (Z-3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone). Consumption of these mutagenic compounds could cause several abnormalities in development and reproduction in humans through long half-lives and mimicking hormone receptors. For example, compounds like dioxins can inhibit the actions of sex hormones by binding to steroid receptors along with causing long lasting cell disruption in several tissues.  Determination of AOX  Persistent organic pollutants such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenols, dioxins, are all assessed in AOX analysis. Generally, the higher the amount of chlorine in an organic compound, the more toxic it is considered. While there are several biochemical or electrochemical methods to remove organic halides, AOX has been preferred due to its low cost of operation and simplicity of design. In a lab, the determination of AOX parameter consists of adsorption of organic halides from the sample on to an activated carbon. The activated carbon can be powdered or granular and adsorbed using microcolumns or a batch process, if the samples are rich in humic acids. Vigorous shaking is often employed in the event of a batch process to favor the adsorption of organic halide on to the activated carbon due to its electronegativity and presence of lone pairs. The inorganic halides that are also adsorbed are washed away using a strong acid such as nitric acid. The carbon with adsorbed organic halide is obtained by filtration, after which the filter containing the carbon is burnt in the presence of oxygen. While combustion of hydrocarbon part of the compounds form CO2 and H2O, halo acids are formed from the halogens. These haloacids are absorbed into acetic acid. Subsequent use of microcolumetric titration, an electrochemical quantification method, provides the AOX content in the sample. Using the dilution ratio, the total AOX content at the location can be estimated. Alternatively, the chlorinated compounds in the sample can be determined by using pentane extraction followed by capillary gas chromatography and electron capture (GC-ECD). The organic carbon that was remaining after the nitric acid purge can be analyzed using UV-persulfate wet oxidation followed by Infrared- detection (IR). Several other analytical techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) could also be implemented to quantify AOX levels. The general adsorption procedure is given below: {C^*}_(s_) + R-X (a.q)\\\\longrightarrow {C^*}-X-R_(s_) + H_2O Where {C^*}_(s_) is the activated carbon and R-X is any organic halide. {C^*}-X-R_(s_) is the organic halide - activated carbon complex that can be filtered out.  Treatment  = Physical separation = In water treatment plants, organic halides are adsorbed using GAC or PAC in agitated tanks. The loaded carbon is separated using a membrane made out of materials like polypropylene or cellulose nitrate. Measuring the AOX levels into and out of the treatment zone shows a drop in organic halide concentrations. Some processes use a two-step GAC filtration to remove AOX precursors, and thus reduce the amount of AOX in treated waters. A two step filtration process consists of two GAC filters in series. The first filter is loaded with exhausted GAC, while the second filter is loaded with fresh GAC. This set up is preferred for its increased efficiency and higher throughput capacity. The GAC is replaced cyclically and the extracted organic halide-carbon mixture is then sent for subsequent biological or chemical treatment such as ozonation to regenerate the GAC. Often, these chemical treatments, while effective, pose economical challenges to the treatment plants. = Biological treatment = A more economically attractive option for treatment of the organic halides is through utilization of biological agents. Recently, bacteria (Ancylobacter aquaticus), fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Coiriolus versicolor), or synthetic enzymes have been used in the degradation of chlorinated organic compounds. The microorganisms degrade halocompounds using either aerobic or anaerobic processes. The mechanisms of degradation include utilization of the compound as carbon source for energy, cometabolite, or as an electron acceptor. Note that enzymatic or microbial action could be regulated through feedback inhibition-the final product in the series inhibits a reaction in the process. An example of a microbe that can degrade AOX is shown below in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1: Step wise degradation of PCE A sample dechlorination of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) such as perchloroethylene (PCE) by Dehalococcoides ethenogenes has been illustrated above. PCE is one of the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of aerobic degradation. The high electronegative character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H2 is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids. Moreover, due to competition from methanogens for H2, low H2 concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass. While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the dechlorination reactions‚ÄìPCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE- RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE- RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal ion cluster like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle. Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces PCE into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to vinyl chloride (VC) and ethylene are performed by TCE-RDase. The dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than dechlorination of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethylene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction. The rate of reductive dechlorination is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms. In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as Desulfomonile, Dehalobacter, Desulfuromonas...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the Dehalococcoides group can perform the complete reductive dechlorination from PCE to ethene. Figure 2: 2,4,6-TBP degradation by Ochrobactrum sp. based on the work of Yamada et al., 2008. In addition to dechlorination of CAHs, microbes have also been reported to act on chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. An example of a reaction where aromatic AOX content has been reduced is demonstrated in figure 2 above. While little is known about the dehalogenation mechanisms of polyhalogenated phenols (PHPs) and polyhalogenated benzenes (PHBs), regioselectivity for halide location on the aromatic ring was observed. This regioselectivity is however dominated by both redox potentials for the reaction and the microbe's familiarity to the reaction. Moreover, due to the specificity of most microbes along with complex aromatic structures, in order to achieve a complete dehalogenation, a mixture of more than one species of bacteria and/or fungi (often known as a consortium) is utilized. The reaction in figure 2 shows the reductive debromination of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP) by Ochrabactrum. Based on the relative degradation of the molecule along with analytical results, it has been postulated that degradation of 2,4,6-TBP proceeds through debromination of ortho-bromine in the first step by a dehalogenase to yield 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP). Since there are two ortho bromines, debromination of either ortho carbons would yield the same product . Other species such as Pseudomonas galthei or Azotobacter sp. showed preference for para-halide over the meta- or ortho -halides. For example, the Azotobacter sp. degrades 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) into 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone due to TCP-4-monooxygenase selectivity differences between ortho- and para-halide. These differences in regioselectivity between the species can be attributed to the specificity of the 3-dimensional enzyme structure and its hindrance from steric interactions. It has been postulated that a proton lost by the phenol group of 2,4,6-TBP resulting in the formation of a negatively charged halo- phenolate ion. Subsequent attack of the para-carbon with a hydride anion from NAD(P)H in a nucleophilic attack manner and resonance rearrangement results in substitution of bromine with hydride and formation of 2,4-DBP. Subsequent steps in a similar pattern yield 2-bromophenol, and phenol in the final step.

He started designing gardens and landscapes in the late 1950s and designed thousands of gardens. He also taught and lectured about horticulture, landscape and interior design. Beginning as a Modernist and working with Dame Sylvia Crowe, Brenda Colvin, Geoffrey Jellicoe and other notable architects and landscape architects, Brookes came of age in the dawn of garden and landscape design for the middle classes in Britain and in the heyday of 1960s London. Brookes was influenced by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholson, and brought abstract and modernist principles to garden design. He espoused the concept that a garden's design should be based first and foremost on the needs of its occupants, taking it out of the realm of the grand garden traditions which were labour-intensive, expensive, and high maintenance. He is the author of over two dozen books, including Room Outside and John Brookes, Master Class, that have been translated into several languages and has taught and lectured in venues around the globe, including Iran, Argentina, Japan, Russia, and the US. In 2004, Brookes was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his for contributions to Garden Design and Services to Horticulture. He died on 16 March 2018 at the age of 84.OBITUARY John Brookes  Early life  Brookes was born in Durham City, UK in 1933, to Edward Percy Brookes and Margaret Alexandra (Poppy) Brookes. He was strongly influenced in his early years by the architecture of Christopher Tunnard, Thomas Church, and Roberto Burle Marx. He also developed an interest in horticulture through years of working on neighbouring farms and long walks and drives through the variable English landscape.  Career  In 1954, after visiting gardens in Southern France and studying horticulture, Brookes enrolled in a three-year apprenticeship in Nottingham Parks Department. His tasks included gardening in walled vegetable gardens, planting traffic islands in the Victorian mode of ‚Äúbedding-out‚Äù, working in hothouses, and arranging flowers for various civic functions. He spent the last six months in the department's design office with the Dutch landscape architect Harry Blom who taught Brookes how to draw to scale and in ink, and introduced him to the professional aspects of landscape design. Four years in the offices of Dame Sylvia Crowe and Brenda Colvin, renowned landscape architects, provided Brookes with further experience and an introduction to London, and he subsequently started his own practice. The next four years he spent working at Architectural Design magazine where he was introduced to prominent architects and landscape architects, and was able to write his own column. He broke into the public realm at the Chelsea Flower Show in 1962, when, as the first independent designer to display a garden, he won the Flora silver medal for a Modernist design that broke with traditional, more horticulturally orientated approaches to garden design. He was 29 years old. His Modernist courtyard for the headquarters of Penguin Books in 1964, brought him wide acclaim and he went on to work on several prominent projects in London, including Fitzroy Square, Bryanston Square, and a courtyard garden for the architect, Michael Manser. He also exhibited several times at the Chelsea Flower Show in the 1970s, earning gold medals for the Financial Times and the Inchbald School of Design. In addition to his private design practice and writing for publications like Architectural Design, Brookes began teaching and lecturing, first at the Institute of Park Administration and then at the Regent Street Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster), and the Royal Botanic Garden at the Kew School of Garden Design. In 1975, he became the Director of Garden Design Studies at the Inchbald School of Design, founded by Jacqueline Duncan (then Inchbald) as the first interior design school in Europe and its first modern garden design school. Two years later, when Inchbald was asked to establish a School of Interior Design by the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, Brookes went to Iran as its first director. When the school was forced to close because of political events, Brookes returned via India, where he spent several months conducting research for his second book, Gardens of Paradise, which focused on the history of Islamic gardens, published in 1988. Upon his return, Brookes resumed his practice and established the Clock House School of Design at Denmans Gardens, near Chichester in West Sussex. He quickly began designing, lecturing, and teaching in the United States and Canada, and subsequently as far afield as Japan, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and Russia. He continued publishing books as well. Among the thousands of gardens he has designed, Brookes‚Äô major public works include the courtyard garden at Penguin Books, the English Garden at the Chicago Botanic Garden, the English Garden at Barakura, in Japan, the College Garden at Westminster Abbey, and Fitzroy Square. He has also designed private estates in the United Kingdom, Patagonia, New York State, Russia, and Poland.  Design philosophy  Brookes was greatly influenced by several American landscape designers, but considers Thomas Church to be his \\"guru\\". Church's landmark book Gardens Are for People led Brookes to his own garden philosophy in which he concluded that what a client needs and wants comes first in formulating a design for a garden. The design and style of the garden is then driven by the characteristics, features, and orientation of the site, the architecture of the house or outbuildings and how they are sited, the patterns and topography of the land, and the cultural context, including history, of the site. The last step in his design projects is the creation of a planting plan. Brookes clearly articulated his guiding design principle ‚Äì that \\"gardens are fundamentally a place for the use by people\\" ‚Äî in his first book, Room Outside, published in 1969 and revised in 2007. This was revolutionary thinking in the 1960s.  The grid  From his exposure to modern architecture and architects, and an intense interest in modern painters, especially Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholson, Brookes developed a method of using a grid as a means of imposing discipline on his designs. The purpose of the grid was to connect the vertical lines of a building with the horizontal lines of a garden by projecting the house module or grid on plan, and extending it beyond the house to create a pattern for the garden that would ultimately have a proportionate relationship to the structure it surrounded. In this way, the grid principle evolved into a methodology in which geometric curves and squares could be introduced to create simple flowing lines and defining spaces.  Denmans Garden  In 1980, Brookes established himself at Denmans, a private garden that was then owned by Joyce Robinson, a great plantswoman, who had acquired the garden in the late 1940s. At the time she and her husband acquired the garden, it had suffered years of neglect and the house associated with the property had been used by as a mess for the officers from nearby Tangmere Air Base during World War II. They grew fruits and flowers for the Covent Garden market in London, and eventually she began gardening for her own pleasure. Brookes was intrigued by her bold planting style and use of gravel, which he'd been using since the early 1960s, and was drawn to the garden's moderate climate and beautiful location at the foot of the West Sussex South Downs. In addition to restarting his practice and establishing his first design school at Denmans, Brookes took over the garden from the ageing ‚ÄúMrs. JR‚Äù as she was known. He gardened there till the end of his life. The garden is open to the public.

She was born in Guadeloupe and is based in New Orleans, Louisiana. Education Following a background in history at Lyc√©e Henri-IV's Hypochartes (preparatory course for the √âcole des Chartes, one of France's \\"Grandes √âcoles\\"), Tancons completed a BA in History of Art (1998) and MA in Museum Studies (1999) at the √âcole du Louvre in Paris, and in 2000 received an MA in History of Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. She was a Helena Rubenstein Curatorial Fellow at the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Program in New York City from 2000-2001. Career =Early Work= In her early years in New York City, following the Whitney fellowship, Tancons worked as a personal assistant and curatorial research assistant for artist Coco Fusco on the exhibition Only Skin Deep: Changing Visions of the American Self (2003). She also became involved with Lorna Simpson, with the artist featuring Tancons in her video work 31 (2002). She subsequently did a one-year curatorial fellowship at the Walker Art Center, where she assisted with the major exhibition How Latitudes Become Forms: Art in a Global Age, curated by Philippe Vergne, Douglas Fogle, and Kemi Ilesanmi. Increasingly interested in performance art, Tancons curated the first solo exhibitions in New York City for South African artist Robin Rhode and choreographer Ralph Lemon, both of whom she met while at the Walker Art Center: Robin Rhode: The Score (Artists Space, New York City, 2004), and Ralph Lemon: (The efflorescence of) Walter (The Kitchen, New York City, 2007), co-curated with Anthony Allen and later traveling in expanded form to the Contemporary Arts Center (New Orleans). During this time, Tancons also did a brief stint at Paula Cooper Gallery, where she curated the Paul D. Miller (DJ Spooky) exhibition Path is Prologue (2004), based on his multimedia performance piece DJ Spooky's Rebirth of a Nation. =Carnival and Processional Performance= Tancons' work of the past decade has focused on histories and contemporary practices of carnival and processional performance ‚Äì particularly among the African diaspora ‚Äì as well as public ceremonial culture, civic ritual, and popular protest movements. Tancons has notably postulated an alternative genealogy of performance art that is routed in Africa, its diaspora, and the legacy of slavery rather than in the European avant-garde. Her curatorial work has gained recognition for exploring ways of curating outside traditional exhibitionary modes - namely, procession, carnival, the second line, walking, marching, parading, and other forms of public ceremony - and for popularizing the term and practice of processional performance. She has also contributed to the anti-capitalism discourse following the Occupy movement and other protest movements, incorporating protest into her curatorial approach and reclaiming, in her words, the \\"rebellious potential\\" of the carnavalesque - \\"as a medium of emancipation and a catalyst for civil disobedience\\" - in writings such as \\"Occupy Wall Street: Carnival Against Capital? Carnivalesque as Protest Sensibility.\\" During a 2004 residency at the Trinidadian contemporary arts center CCA7, which led to the exhibition Lighting the Shadow: Trinidad In and Out of Light, Tancons began to explore carnival as a contemporary art practice. The residency led to Tancons' collaborations with Trinidadian contemporary artist Marlon Griffith, as well as famed carnival artist, or mas- man, Peter Minshall and his carnival production team The Callaloo Company. A subsequent engagement with carnival and procession was the exhibition Mas': From Process to Procession? Caribbean Carnival as Art Practice, which Tancons curated in 2007 at the BRIC Rotunda Gallery, New York. The exhibition featured artists with ties to the Caribbean whose work recognized carnival as a vital contemporary art form. In 2014 she organized Up Hill Down Hall: An Indoor Carnival as part of the BMW Tate Live Series at Tate Modern. Described by Tancons as \\"a mass public processional performance,\\" the project drew on carnival as a ritual of resistance. Performances by artists Marlon Griffith and Hew Locke, along with hundreds of participants, were staged in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. In 2015, the exhibition EN MAS': Carnival and Performance Art of the Caribbean, which Tancons initiated and curated with art historian Krista Thompson, opened at the Contemporary Arts Center (New Orleans), before traveling to various locations in the Caribbean and the United States with Independent Curators International. EN MAS' had won the Emily Hall Tremaine Exhibition Award in 2012. Tancons has also collaborated with New Orleans Airlift Artistic Director Delaney Martin to organize the performances Public Practice: An Anti-Violence Community Ceremony (2014) and Rally Under the Bridge (2014) in New Orleans, Louisiana. =International Biennials= Active in the field of international contemporary art biennials, Tancons is currently a curator for Sharjah Biennial 14: Leaving the Echo Chamber (with Zoe Butt and Omar Kholeif) for which she is curating the \\"Look for Me All Around You\\", a platform dedicated to problematizing the politics of performance under globalizing conditions of dispossession and diasporization. She was Associate Curator for the first iteration of Prospect New Orleans, from 2007-2009. In 2008, she organized the processional performance SPRING for the 7th Gwangju Biennial, under the direction of Okwui Enwezor, which received numerous positive reviews. SPRING merged the forms of carnival parade, political demonstration, and funeral procession with performances in the streets of Gwangju by Mario Benjamin, Marlon Griffith, Jin Won Lee, Jarbas Lopes, MAP Office, Karyn Olivier, and Caecilia Tripp. Additionally, Tancons was a guest curator for CAPE 09 in 2009, a research curator for the Biennale B√©nin in 2012, and a curator for the 2013 G√∂teborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art. In 2012-2013, with a group of students formed during her summer curatorial intensive courses at IUAV, Tancons conceived FAR FESTA: Nuove Festa Veneziane, a project inspired by the civic rituals of the former Venice Republic, and co-curated Corteo de Casteo I and II during the 55th Venice Biennale. =Recent Work= etcetera: un rituel civique, under the artistic direction of Claire Tancons with Mohamed Bourouissa and Christophe Chassol Recently, Tancons was guest curator for the 2017 Printemps de Septembre in Toulouse, France, and the Artistic Director of etcetera: un rituel civique with artist Mohamed Bourouissa and composer Christophe Chassol. She was also the Artistic Director of Tide by Side, a processional performance celebrating the opening of the Faena District (Miami Beach), in collaboration with Arto Lindsay as musical director and Gia Wolff as architectural director. The performance featured the work of Cuban artist collective Los Carpinteros, artists Carlos Betancourt, Marinella Senatore, Miralda and Carnival Arts with special guest appearance by Ernesto Neto alongside Miami-based artists and collectives.

It is one of the rare temples of the Hindu deity Chitragupta, considered to the assistant of Yama, the Hindu god of death. Chitragupta is believed to have emerged from a painting and set as the accountant of good and bad deeds of human beings by Brahma. The temple has a three-tiered Rajagopuram (gateway tower) and a single precinct around the sanctum. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to various others. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The major festival celebrated in the temple in Chitra Pournami during April. The temple is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in the city. Legend As per Hindu legend, Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction was discussing with his wife Parvathi about maintaining Dharma amidst all human beings in earth and maintaining good account of their deeds. He felt that he wanted to have someone to have a close watch on the people to prevent them from indulging in crime and involving themselves in good deeds. Shiva drew a picture in a gold plate - Parvathi was impressed and wanted Shiva to detail it. The picture turned into a deity by the divine grace of Shiva and Parvathi. Shiva entrusted the duty of maintaining the account of deeds of all human beings in earth. He came to be known as Chitraguptha as he was derived from a Chitra (piture) and Gupta (accountant). He was set as the accountant of Yama, who is the Hindu deity of death. As per another legend, Brihaspati, the Guru of planetary deities had a disagreement with Indra, the king of celestial deities. On account of the confrontation, Brihaspati discontinued his advocacy to Indra. At a later point, Indra realized his mistakes and patched up with his Guru. To expiate himself from the sins created, he started on a pilgrimage and reached the place to find a Linga. He constructed a temple in the place and golden lotuses started appearing in the nearby temple tank. The day was Chitra Pournami. A third legend states that Indra prayed to Shiva to have a child, but as per the divine wish, his wife Indrani was not supposed have any progeny. Shiva directed Kamadhenu, the holy cow to give birth to a child. Shiva later entrusted the child to Indra and Indrani, who later brought him up as Chitragupta. Architecture and history The temple has a three-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The central shrine has the image of Chitragupta in seated posture. He is sported with a ezhuthaani (pen) in his right hand and scripts in his left hand. Archaeologist have confirmed based on the inscriptions that the temple was built during the 9th century by the Medieval Cholas. The temple has various maintenance activities during the subsequent period. During the repair works carried out during 1911, two historical metal idols of Chitragupta and his consort Karnikambal were found. These images are housed in the central sanctum. During modern times, a consecration was performed during 1918 and 1994. The temple has been administered by a group of hereditary trustees. Religious importance Chitragupta, as per Hinduism is the accountant of Yama, the death god, who keeps track of good and bad deeds of humanbeings to decide their residence in heaven or hell. The temple is just one of its kind that has a separate temple for Chitragupta. Every new moon, there are special worship practices followed in the temple. The major festival celebrated in the temple in Chitra Pournami during April. Chitragupta is considered the Adidevata for Ketu, the ninth planet of Hindu astrology. The deity is worshipped by both Shaivites and Vaishnavites. Women devotees observe fast or consume food without salt during the day to seek blessings of Chitragupta. During old times, traditional village accountants worship god seeking divine blessings for their profession.

Miller and written by Nick Gordon. The film stars Hayden Christensen and Bruce Willis. Plot Wall Street broker Will Beeman (Hayden Christensen) has been struggling with being present for his wife Laura (Megan Leonard) and son Danny (Ty Shelton). Shortly after hearing of Danny being bullied at school, Will decides to take his family to his hometown, Granville, Ohio in order to bond with Danny. Upon entering Granville, Will is reacquainted with Police Chief Marvin Howell (Bruce Willis), a family friend who knew Will's father and at one point dated his aunt, Dottie (Deb G. Girdler). Howell advises Will on taking precaution after informing him of a recent bank robbery where a couple of millions were stolen. While teaching Danny how to hunt with a rifle, Will and Danny witness a heated exchange between two men, one of them holding the other at gunpoint, enquiring after money drop-off not going according to plan. The unarmed man (Gethin Anthony) is shot in the shoulder after throwing a key near Will's position at a shooting station; Danny's shocked gasp at the shooting attracts the gunman's attention. The gunman opens fire on Will's location, prompting Will fearing for his son's safety, to shoot him with his hunting rifle in self-defense. Upon inspecting the dead gunman, he's surprised to discover a concealed badge - that the gunman was a police officer who failed to identify himself. Distraught, Will brings the wounded man to the family cabin in order for Laura, a surgeon to provide first aid and hopefully save the only other witness to the proceedings. Shortly after being treated and bandaged-up, on regaining consciousness the man takes Danny hostage at knife-point, demanding that Will help him retrieve the discarded key in exchange for Danny's freedom. While attempting to retrieve the key back at the shooting shack, they're surprised by a uniformed officer, Richie Stechel (William DeMeo), who opens fire on Will and the gunman. The gunman tells Will to meet him at a bulletin board after retrieving the key, then absconds with Will's car and son as hostage. After a failed attempt at pursuing his son, Will learns of the gunman's name from Howell as Levi Barrett, and that the deceased officer was Richie's brother, Charlie (Shea Buckner). Will waits until nightfall to retrieve the key, only to be confronted by Richie. Will successfully subdues Richie, left hand-cuffed to a tree, then heads to the bulletin board for further instructions. Meanwhile, Danny bonds with Levi and learns the reasons behind the bank robbery. Howell and the Stechel brothers engineered the heist and intended to use Levi as the fall guy. Levi agreed to the heist in order to financially support Mabel Fantion (Christine Dye), his girlfriend Adele's (Magi Avila) cancer-ridden mother. Levi was supposed to drop off the stolen money at a drop-site, but suspecting the cops would likely betray him, did not arrive due to fear of the site being compromised with a potential assassin. Howell also deduces Levi's predicament after a uniformed officer investigates Barrett's apartment. Howell and Will converge on Mabel's hospital bed, with Howell questioning Will's motivation for being there. While Howell is distracted with a radio call by an officer, Will receives a map from Mabel revealing the location of the post office where the stolen money was stashed and the location of an underground bunker at which to make the exchange for his son. The key is used to unlock the mailbox containing the stolen cash. Will briefly eludes Howell but is caught again after retrieving the money. Seemingly sympathetic to Will's situation, Howell provides Will transport to the bunker in order to apprehend Levi. Will gives the money to Levi and is reunited with Danny. Simultaneous to this reunion, Richie kidnaps Laura from the family cabin and drives her to Howell's location for a leverage of their own. While attempting to flee, Adele is murdered by Howell. Left with nothing to lose, Levi attacks Howell and Richie only to be wounded. Will takes Danny to a hunter's watchtower, where Danny soon after pushes a pursuing Richie off a high ladder to knock him out (due to following good anti-bullying advice Levi imparted to him previously while bonding over computer games). Howell holds Laura at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her if Will doesn't hand over the money. Desperate to help his parents, Danny retrieves a pistol from the unconscious Richie and attempts to shoot Howell, only for Will to stop him. In an attempt to taunt Will, Howell reveals himself as the person that murdered Will's father years earlier. Levi distracts Howell, while Laura ducks providing Will the opportunity to shoot Howell in the head. During the aftermath, Levi dies of his injuries, much to Danny's sadness. Richie is questioned by the rest of the police department, and Mabel is found dead on the hospital bed, murdered by Howell previously by removing her life support system. As the remaining incorrupt officers boast on news media over the recovered loot, the Beeman family relinquish their hunting rifles and decide to return back home to deal with their daily lives.

Early life  Tomac was born in Ozernoe, Ukraine, a city in the south of Basarabia, formerly Ismail County and came to Romania at the age of 17, through a scholarship program offered by the Romanian Government to Romanians living abroad. Active in politics from early adulthood, Tomac was president of the League for Romanian Youth Abroad from 2000-2004 and then coordinator of youth national projects at the Democratic Education Center. From 2004‚Äì2006, Tomac was coordinator of the ‚ÄúNews to Know‚Äù project, implemented with the support of the United States Department of State in the disadvantaged rural areas of Romania. He also worked as editor at the ‚ÄúZiua‚Äù and ‚ÄúConfluen»õe‚Äù newspapers, and at the Romanian Public Radio and Television.  Studies  Eugen Tomac graduated from the History Faculty at the University of Bucharest in 2003 with the thesis ‚ÄúBasarabia, a Romanian Province on the Outskirts of the USSR‚Äù. He earned his master's degree in 2004 from the same school, with the thesis paper ‚ÄúMechanisms of Denationalization in the USSR‚Äù.  Professional career  During his university years, Tomac was editor at the ‚ÄúMagazin Istoric,‚Äù a history journal, where he published several studies about Basarabia and Romanians abroad. Later, he taught history at the Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi Institute for Romanians Abroad (within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), where he was once a student and where Romanians from Albania, Macedonia, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia and the Ukraine study. In 2006, at the age of 25, Tomac joined the Presidential Administration as an Expert, responsible for relations with Romanians Everywhere. In 2009, he was appointed Secretary of State for Romanians Abroad, within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the formal establishment of the Department for Romanians Abroad under the Prime Minister's coordination, Eugen Tomac was appointed Secretary of State for the Boc and Ungureanu governments, and under his leadership, he actively contributed to the simplification of the process for the regaining of Romanian citizenship for Romanians from the Republic of Moldova. Tomac also decided on the donation of over one million Romanian books for libraries and schools in the Republic of Moldova, and on the re-publishing of almost half a million Romanian History manuals for educational institutions in the Republic of Moldova.

As first Vice-Chair of the Romanians Abroad LDP organization, he was proposed to run the campaign for the Parliamentary elections in 2008, applying for the seat of Deputy, representing the Romanians from Eastern Europe and Asia. Although he had the most votes, due to the uninominal voting protocol, he did not win. During the next Parliamentary elections, he ran again and won the seat in the Parliament in the same County (Eastern Europe and Asia) with the highest score among his party colleagues, 78.7% of the votes. He was subsequently appointed Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for the Romanian Communities Abroad. Shortly after he was elected, in May 2013, he opened the first parliamentary office in the capital of the Republic of Moldova, Chi»ôinƒÉu, for helping Romanians in the Republic of Moldova in order to solve the problems the Romanian institutions are competent for.

The game contains five sports minigames, football, baseball, tennis, golf, and horse racing, and was released worldwide in March 2017. Gameplay The game consists of five sports ‚Äì football, baseball, tennis, golf, and horse racing. Despite the number of sports contained, they are not mini-games, but rather, full-scale recreations of each sport. For example, the soccer part of the game contains eleven versus eleven gameplay, the same as is standard in the sport. Each individual sport contains single player tournaments, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer game modes. Development The game was first announced during a Nintendo Direct on September 1, 2016. Despite Nintendo's ownership of the Mario franchise, the title was co-developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Camelot Software Planning, with the latter having developed games in the Mario Golf and Mario Tennis series. While Nintendo's Mario Sports line has featured stand-alone entries in soccer (Mario Strikers), baseball (Mario Super Sluggers), tennis (Mario Tennis) and golf (Mario Golf), they had never featured horse racing, or compiled all these sports into one compilation. Additionally, all of the sports except tennis had previously been featured in minigames in the Mario Party series. The game was released worldwide in March 2017. As with Camelot's previous Mario sports titles, the soundtrack was written and arranged by Motoi Sakuraba. Reception Mario Sports Superstars received mixed reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Destructoid called it a \\"lazy experience, one developed solely for the purpose of selling what are basically Mario-branded Topps cards.\\" Nintendo Life stated though that as a single player experience, it was \\"totally functional yet painfully lifeless\\". By May 2017, the game had sold over 92,829 copies in Japan.

It involved information provided by former high-ranking member of the KGB, Anatoliy Golitsyn, who defected to the United States in December 1961. Golitsyn stated that the Soviets had agents placed throughout French military intelligence and even within Charles de Gaulle's cabinet. He claimed that these agents had access to any NATO document on demand. The news so alarmed President Kennedy that he sent a courier to hand deliver a message to Charles de Gaulle outlining the situation. Over the spring and summer of 1962, a team of French counter-intelligence officers interrogated Golitsyn for weeks. As his identity was closely guarded by the US, the French assigned him the code-name \\"Martel\\". Their interrogations overcame their initial suspicion that he was a CIA double-agent and they returned to France with grave warnings about the state of French security. French-US relations were strained at this time due to de Gaulle's policy of \\"Politics of Grandeur\\", and in return, de Gaulle was highly skeptical of the US's motives. Believing the story to be a fabrication, French intelligence was very deliberate in their investigations, and no action had been taken by late 1962. This was to the amazement of the US establishment, who began to take measures to exclude France from the NATO reporting chain. This led to NATO becoming largely non-functional for a year. Ultimately there was a three-year breakdown in US-French intelligence sharing. The story only became public some years later when the former French intelligence liaison at the French embassy in Washington, Philippe Thyraud de Vosjoli, reported the story in an expos√© in Life magazine in 1968. A friend of de Vosjoli, Leon Uris, used a highly fictionalized version of the Martel affair as the basis for the novel (and movie) Topaz.  Anatoliy Golitsyn  In 1961, Anatoliy Golitsyn, a major in the KGB, was assigned to the embassy in Helsinki, Finland, under the name \\"Ivan Klimov.\\" On 15 December, he defected to the US, along with his wife and daughter, by riding the train to the Swedish border. Golitsyn's defection so alarmed the KGB that orders were sent out to cancel all meetings with field agents out of fear that they would be identified. Golitsyn was flown to the US and interviewed by David Murphy, the head of the CIA's Soviet Russia Division. After some time, Golitsyn began making increasing demands of the US and complaining about his treatment. Considering him to be unreliable, Murphy passed him on to James Jesus Angleton, the CIA's director of counterintelligence. Golitsyn's description of a traitor in the CIA, whom he knew only as \\"Sasha\\", led Angleton to embark on a multiyear manhunt that accused many members of the CIA of being the spy. The entire affair is still highly controversial. Golitsyn's information ultimately led to the identification or the confirmation of Soviet spies throughout the Western world, including Kim Philby, Donald Duart Maclean, Guy Burgess, the potential double agent Aleksander Kopatzky, and many others. He also claimed that their contacts had so infiltrated NATO that they were able to produce any secret document within a few days. So much information had been received that the KGB was using NATO's own document numbers to catalog them. He could not identify the NATO mole directly but knew that he spoke French. He also suggested the existence of a widespread network of KGB spies within the various branches of the French military and government offices.  Kennedy's letter  Kennedy was alarmed by the implications of a French spy within NATO. Unable to trust any official communications network, he took the unusual route of handwriting a personal letter to de Gaulle and having it delivered directly to him by a courier. After outlining the worrying information, the letter went on to offer to de Gaulle direct access to the agent by members of the French security services. The letter arrived at a time when US-French relations were at a low point. In the postwar period, both the US and the UK had set up spy networks in Paris with the explicit aim of spying on the Soviets but also with the secondary role of keeping an eye on political developments in France. The French were well aware of those networks but tolerated them until the 1950s. However, de Gaulle's policy of grandeur demanded for France to be able to keep its own secrets, and he began a policy to attempt to break down those networks. He ordered the SDECE to begin those efforts in January 1962. De Gaulle expected there to be some sort of reprisal on the part of the CIA, and he went as far as falsely believeing that the US might be behind the Organisation de l'arm√©e secr√®te (OAS), which tried to assassinate him. All of that was taking place while Kennedy's letter arrived. That led the French to believe that the entire affair might be a CIA-led effort to discredit and shake up the French services, but a personal letter from the US president could not be ignored.  French interrogations  De Gaulle responded by placing Jean-Louis de Rougemont in charge of determining whether it was true that Martel was a Soviet defector. De Rougemont was the director of the Second Division of the National Defense staff, which had the task of co-ordinating the various intelligence services. He also had deep personal contacts with his counterparts in the US establishment. He flew to Washington, DC, in the spring of 1962 to meet with his contacts and was granted three or four days of personal interviews with Golitsyn, whose identity was still a highly-guarded secret and so he was referred to only as \\"Martel.\\" Initially believing Martel to be a ride, created by the US, de Rougemont was convinced otherwise by his meetings. De Rougemont made his report directly to √âtienne Burin des Roziers, the Secretary-General of the √âlys√©e, who organized a meeting with the heads of the Service de Documentation Ext√©rieure et de Contre-Espionnage (SDECE) and the Direction de la Securite du Territoire (DST), responsible for external and internal security. They had been aware of rumors that a high-ranking defector was in CIA hands, and des Roziers told them that the defector was real, he was as important as the rumors suggested, and his information about French security demanded an immediate detailed debriefing by counterintelligence experts. A mission was quickly arranged and arrived in Washington, DC, in May. Liaising with the French intelligence attach√©, de Vosjoli, a safe house was provided for the team. He was upset to learn that previous meetings had taken place without his involvement and that the letter from Kennedy to de Gaulle, being nonspecific, had impugned the entire French establishment. He initially believed that Martel might be a double agent on a mission of upsetting French- US relations. However, the team's reports, which he forwarded to Paris, quickly convinced him otherwise. In one particularly telling series of questions, the French officers attempted to trap Martel. Since he claimed that he had personally seen a number of NATO reports in Moscow, the team provided Martel with a range of documents, some real and some fake. Martel was able to identify a few of them as having been personally seen by him, but he identified all of those that were real he stated every one of the fake documents as not having seen them. That development was extremely worrying. He then went on to provide a complete description of the organization and the operation of the SDECE, including details of a secret reorganization in 1958. When pressed for details on the identities of agents, Martel was able to provide only details of their operations and general descriptions. He had only seen their reports and was not involved in their actual operations, but he was aware, in general terms, of what positions they held. Returning to France after two weeks of interrogations, the team looked over the interviews and attempted to identify various details. They returned to Washington again to confirm their suspicions with Martel, who was able to eliminate many of their guesses and to suggest others that matched the details that he knew. That led to the identification of widespread networks within the Ministry of the Interior; Defense and Foreign Affairs; a member of de Gaulle's cabinet; an entire network of twelve agents, known as \\"Sapphire,\\" operating within the SDECE and a second network within the SDECE that was specifically tasks with passing on US nuclear secrets.  Increasing suspicion  It was the last item that led to intense distrust of the information within French intelligence. Martel claimed that the nuclear network had been created by the KGB in 1959. Although there was such an effort taking place, it had been created by the French in 1960. The plan was started by Louis Joxe, tasked by de Gaulle with building the force de frappe, France's nuclear efforts. Joxe had concluded that France could not make a modern force on its own and needed to steal US designs. That led the SDECE to believe that the CIA had become aware of French plans and so had planted the story with Martel to scare the French into canceling them. As one official put it: US agents sat in on the French debriefing meetings, but that curiously further strained relations. Every time that the French team attempted to confirm or to deny a name as one that Martel had heard of, the US became highly suspicious of that name. Since the team tried many names, the US was concerned that the entire French government was involved. That was, however, minor compared to anger over news that the French were apparently setting up a nuclear intelligence team. General Paul Jacquier, who had recently been appointed as head of the SDECE, arrived in Washington on 5 October 1962. His mission was to inform the US that France would be expanding the SDECE to a worldwide organization that would operate against both the East and the West. The British intelligence services had arrested Vassall and were in the process of rounding up many of the other agents who had been alluded to by Martel. The French, on the other hand, had done nothing. At a formal dinner in Jacquier's honor, the US made it clear that its patience was at an end and that it expected action soon. One agent went so far as to state to Jacquier, \\"Your service is infiltrated. We know that you are not at fault, because you are new in your job and new at this business. But you must take the right measures.\\"  Major effects but little action  NATO had been strained in the early 1960s by an effort to form a multinational naval nuclear agreement that ended in acrimonious debate. It was into that environment that the Martel affair exploded. By the autumn of 1962, the affair had largely ended the flow of information with NATO, with only the most basic information, which was needed to keep it running, being exchanged. That led to the first suggestions outside France that Martel might be a double agent. Critics pointed out that Martel's leads were generally for agents that had been in place for many years but were well past their prime in terms of having access to useful information. However, that information was responsible for the near-collapse of NATO. However, as the full weight of the information worked its way through various countries' intelligence apparatus, the conclusion that he was telling the truth became unavoidable. Among the military alone, John Vassall of the UK Admiralty, Swedish Defense Ministry official Stig Wennerstr√∂m, Canadian economist (working at NATO) Hugh Hambleton, German Federal Intelligence Service operative Heinz Felfe, and US Army Sergeant (working at the National Security Agency) Jack Dunlap were all exposed as a result of Martel's reports. France, on the other hand, did little with the information. The efforts to track down the NATO spy led to the only French public action on the Martel case. Georges P√¢ques was arrested on suspicion of spying on 23 September 1963 and ultimately admitted to having spied for the Soviets since 1944. P√¢ques was one of France's most senior officials at NATO and was naturally suspected as source of many of the papers that Martel had seen. However, since P√¢ques had become active in NATO only in 1962, he could not be the source of the earlier information that had been seen by Martel. It is now believed that the French-speaking Hambleton was the actual source of the papers, but he was not uncovered until years later. A number of other possibilities were investigated, but no damning evidence was ever found. Among these was Joxe, whose suggestion of spying on IS nuclear secrets could have been a Soviet plan that he was carrying out. Diplomat George Gorse was also suspected, followed by, in a strange turn of events, both the deputy head of the SDECE, L√©onard Hounay, and the head of the DST, Ren√© Delsen, who had debriefed Martel in 1962. After another meeting with Martel in November, Hounay was quietly dismissed, but no other overt action was taken. It is speculated that the critical political climate in France after the Algerian War had led de Gaulle to bury the story for fears of a right-wing coup. Whether or not anyone was highly placed is open to speculation. Golitsyn had told the US that there was a similar highly-placed spy within the CIA whom he knew only by the codename \\"Sasha\\". That led Angleton on a multiyear, increasingly paranoid, mole hunt, which ultimately proved fruitless. His handpicked investigator, Clare Edward Petty, once concluded that it might be Angleton himself who was the spy, working in concert with Golitsyn, a double agent. Aspersions were cast across the CIA and outside it, and many people's careers were ruined when Angleton suggested they might be Sasha.  Resignation of de Vosjoli  According to de Vosjoli's account, a number of sinister events suggested that the SDECE was as deeply penetrated as Martel had suggested. In the early summer of 1962, de Vosjoli became aware of rumors of a Soviet buildup in Cuba, apparently of surface-to- air missiles. He flew to Havana in August, where he began to receive reports that a new type of missile was also being seen that was much larger. They included reports from a former French officer who could tell the difference between the two models. De Vosjoli passed that information on to the director of the CIA, John McCone, who thanked him for his efforts. Jacquier called de Vosjoli to Paris in December and made two demands: for him to turn over the names of all his contacts in Cuba and to start setting up a network within the US to spy on its nuclear technology. The demands astounded de Vosjoli since it contradicted the only story that Martel had stated not to appear to have any basis, but de Vosjoli was now being asked to set up just that network. However, a reason was given: the French had learned that the US and UK had just arranged the Nassau Agreement to give the UK access to US nuclear technology, and the French could no longer wait to set up their efforts. In February 1963, de Vosjoli forwarded a lengthy report from one of his Cuban contacts containing details of Soviet forces in Cuba. The SDECE demanded him turn over the name of his contact, which he finally revealed. The agent was soon arrested by the Cubans, and de Vosjoli was advised that his name was also known to the Cubans and so he should no longer visit Cuba. It was that series of events that led de Vosjoli to contact Herv√© Alphand, the French ambassador to the US. Alphand contacted trusted members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and found that they were entirely unaware of the issue since the SDECE had not informed them of the Martel information. The SDECE immediately identified de Vosjoli as the source of the request and informed him on 16 September that he was being replaced. He did not return to France and is considered to be the only example of a French intelligence officer defecting to the US. French inaction on the Martel case, combined with de Vosjoli's very public dismissal, eventually led to a complete breakdown in French-US intelligence-sharing in 1964. The issues were not entirely cleared up for three years, when normal communications resumed.

In such ceremonies, the Mishaguji were 'summoned' by one of the shrine's high-ranking priests, the Kan-no-Osa (Á•ûÈï∑, also Jinch≈ç) or Jinch≈çkan (Á•ûÈï∑ÂÆò), into persons or objects that would act as their vessels (yorishiro) for the duration of the ritual, being then 'dismissed' upon its completion. In addition to playing a role in Suwa Shrine's religious rites, the Mishaguji are also enshrined in 'Mishaguji Shrines' (Âæ°Á§æÂÆÆÂè∏Á§æ Mishaguji-sha) found throughout the Lake Suwa region and its vicinity. Worship of kami with similar-sounding names are also attested in various localities throughout east and central Japan; indeed, such deities have been speculated to be related to the Mishaguji. The exact nature of the Mishaguji is a matter of debate. Medieval documents from the Upper Shrine seem to imply them to be lesser gods or spirits subordinate to the shrine's deity, Suwa Daimy≈çjin (a.k.a. Takeminakata), with post-medieval sources conflating them with Suwa Daimy≈çjin's children; indeed, 'Mishaguji' was often interpreted as an epithet of these gods during the early modern period. In addition, outside of Suwa Shrine the Mishaguji were also worshiped as, among other things, god(s) of boundaries and tutelary protectors (ubusunagami) of local communities. In this regard they are functionally similar to the guardian gods known as D≈çsojin or Sai-no-kami. Upon becoming the focus of intense study during the modern period (especially during the postwar era), various theories as to the origins and original nature of Mishaguji worship and its relation to Suwa Shrine began to be put forward by local historians and other scholars. One theory for instance claims that they were originally deities of fertility or agriculture, another proposes that the Mishaguji were viewed as spirits that inhabited sacred rocks or trees, while yet another claims that 'Mishaguji' originally denoted an impersonal, empowering force in present in nature analogous to the Austronesian concept of mana. As phallic stone rods (Áü≥Ê£í sekib≈ç) dating from the J≈çmon period and similar prehistoric artifacts are employed as cult objects (shintai) in some Mishaguji-related shrines in Suwa and other areas, a number of authors have speculated that Mishaguji worship may ultimately originate from J≈çmon religious beliefs. A few even surmise that the Mishaguji were already being worshiped in Suwa before the cult of Takeminakata - claimed here to be a later import - was introduced into the region; the appearance of the Mishaguji in the Upper Shrine's rites are seen by these scholars to be a relic of original local beliefs. These assumptions, however, have recently come into question. Names Multiple variants of the name 'Mishaguji' exist such as 'Mishaguchi', 'Misaguchi', 'Misaguji', 'Mishakuji', 'Misakuji(n)', or 'Omishaguji'.Moriya, Sanae (1991). Moriya Jinch≈çke no ohanashi (ÂÆàÁü¢Á•ûÈï∑ÂÆ∂„ÅÆ„ÅäË©±„Åó). In Jinch≈çkan Moriya Historical Museum (Ed.).

There are also various ways of rendering the name in kanji such as Âæ°Â∑¶Âè£Á•û, Âæ°‰ΩúÁ•û, Âæ°Á§æÂÆÆÁ•û, or Âæ°Á§æÂÆÆÂè∏, with Âæ°Â∑¶Âè£Á•û being the commonly used form in medieval documents penned by the Suwa Shrine priesthood. Outside Suwa, deities thought to be related to the Mishaguji with names such as '(O)shaguji', '(O)shagoji', '(O)sang≈´ji', 'Sa(n)goji', 'Saguji', 'Shagottsan', 'Shagottan', 'Jogu-san', 'Osang≈´-san', 'Oshamotsu-sama', or 'Oshamoji-sama' - with different ways of writing them in kanji - are found. The name's etymology is uncertain. During the early modern period when the Mishaguji were conflated with the divine children (mikogami) of Takeminakata, the god of the Upper Suwa Shrine, the name was explained as being derived from the term sakuchi (Èó¢Âú∞, lit. 'to open up / develop the land'), which in turn was connected with legends that credit Takeminakata's offspring with forming and developing the land of Shinano. The name has also been interpreted as deriving from shakujin / ishigami (Áü≥Á•û 'stone deity'), a term used for sacred stones or rocks that were worshiped as repositories (shintai) of kami (it has been observed that stones or stone items were employed as shintai in many Mishaguji-related shrines), or shakujin (Â∞∫Á•û), due to another association with bamboo poles and measuring ropes used in land surveying and boundary marking.≈åwa (1990). pp. 189-191. The term sakujin (‰ΩúÁ•û 'harvest / crop deity') has also been suggested as a possible origin. ≈åwa Iwao (1990) meanwhile theorized the name to be derived from (mi)sakuchi (honorific prefix Âæ° mi- + ‰ΩúÈúä, Âí≤Èúä sakuchi), a spirit (chi; cf. ikazu-chi, oro-chi, mizu-chi) that brings forth or opens up (saku, cf. Âí≤„Åè 'to bloom', Ë£Ç„Åè 'to tear open', ‰Ωú 'to do/make/cultivate/grow'Ôºõcf. also the verb sakuru/shakuru 'to dig/scoop up') the latent life force present in the soil or the female womb.≈åwa (1990). pp. 192-194.Oh (2011). p. 178. Extent of cult 'Mishaguji' shrines by region (in Japanese) Research conducted by local historian Imai Nogiku in the 1950s revealed a total of 780 shrines to the Mishaguji (or similarly-named deities) within Nagano Prefecture, 109 of which are in the Suwa area (comprising the modern municipalities of Chino, Suwa, Okaya, Shimosuwa, Fujimi, and Hara).Miyasaka (1987). p. 24.Oh (2011). p. 164. As noted above, worship of possibly related kami with names such as 'S(h)aguji' or 'S(h)agoji' are also attested in neighboring areas, being notably widespread throughout the Kant≈ç and Ch≈´bu regions of Japan. Shrines enshrining these gods are found in places such as Shizuoka (233 shrines), Aichi (229 shrines), Yamanashi (160 shrines), Mie (140 shrines) and Gifu (116 shrines).≈åwa (1990). p. 199.Tanaka (2011). p. 128. On the other hand, such shrines are conspicuously absent in the two prefectures of Niigata and Toyama, located to the north of Nagano. Ont≈ç Mishaguji S≈çsha (Âæ°È†≠Âæ°Á§æÂÆÆÂè∏Á∑èÁ§æ) in Chino, Nagano The head shrine of the local Mishaguji shrine network in Suwa is the Ont≈ç Mishaguji S≈çsha (Âæ°È†≠Âæ°Á§æÂÆÆÂè∏Á∑èÁ§æ) in Chino, situated within the grounds of the Moriya family estate. Before the Meiji period, the Moriya (ÂÆàÁü¢Ê∞è) served in the Upper Suwa Shrine as priests known as Kan-no-Osa (Á•ûÈï∑) or Jinch≈çkan (Á•ûÈï∑ÂÆò). The Jinch≈çkan was second only to the ≈åh≈çri (Â§ßÁ•ù), the shrine's high priest revered both as the descendant and the living vessel or shintai of the shrine's deity, Takeminakata, and was responsible for conducting the shrine's religious ceremonies; indeed, summoning and dismissing the Mishaguji in rituals was held to be the prerogative of this priest.Moriya (1991). pp. 4-5.Miyasaka. (1987). pp. 25-27. However, local historians believe that the Maemiya (ÂâçÂÆÆ), one of the Upper Shrine's two sub-shrines and one of the four sites that comprise the Suwa Grand Shrine complex, was the original center of local Mishaguji worship, known as the 'Great Mishaguji' (Â§ßÂæ°Á§æÂÆÆÁ•û ≈å-Mishaguji); indeed, medieval records refer to the \\"twenty Mishaguji of the Maemiya\\" (ÂâçÂÆÆÂªø„ÉéÂæ°Á§æÂÆÆÁ•û).

Mishaguji are believed to be spirits that dwell in rocks, trees, or bamboo leaves,Miyasaka (1987). p. 27.Tanigawa (1987). p. 185, 193. as well as various man-made objects such as phallic stone rods (Áü≥Ê£í sekib≈ç), grinding slabs (Áü≥Áöø ishizara) or mortars (Áü≥Ëáº ishiusu).≈åwa (1990). p. 191.Oh (2011). p. 164. In addition to the above, Mishaguji are also thought to descend upon straw effigiesTanigawa (1987). pp. 180-181. as well as possess human beings, especially during religious rituals. This concept of Mishaguji as a possessing spirit are reflected in texts that describe Mishaguji being 'brought down' (ÈôçÁî≥ oroshi-m≈çsu, i.e. being summoned into a repository, whether human or object) or 'lifted up' (‰∏äÁî≥ age-m≈çsu, i.e. being dismissed from its vessel) by the Moriya jinch≈çkan, the priest with the exclusive right to call upon Mishaguji in the religious rites of the Suwa Grand Shrine.Miyasaka (1987). p. 26. Folk beliefs considered Mishaguji to be associated with fertility and the harvest, as well as healers of diseases like the common cold or pertussis.Miyasaka (1987). p. 25. Mishaguji have been worshipped as tutelary deities of whole villages (Áî£ÂúüÁ•û ubusuna-gami) as well as specific kinship groups (Á•ùÁ•û iwai-gami).Miyasaka (1987). p. 23. Further reflecting this relationship between Mishaguji and local communities is their being believed to preside over the act of founding villages as well as their being associated with the broadly similar concept of saikami (patrons of boundaries or borders). Mishaguji in Suwa Within the Suwa region, syncretism with other myths has resulted in the representation of Mishaguji as snakes, as well as their connection with the story of Takeminakata-no-kami and Moreya-no-kami; Moreya-no-kami is said to represent the autochthonous worship of Mishaguji that syncretized with the worship of new gods represented by Takeminakata-no-kami.„ÄéÊù±Ê¥ãÁ•ûÂêç‰∫ãÂÖ∏„Äèp. 463  See also  * Suwa-taisha * Moreya * Takeminakata * Snake worship * Suwa clan * Mana * Holy Spirit * Great Spirit * Baetylus * Animism Notes  References  Bibliography   Fertility deities Japanese deities Japanese mythology Nature deities Shinto kami Suwa faith ","title":"Mishaguji"},{"id":"51487742","text":"Gerald Percy Wibberley, CBE (15 April 1915 ‚Äì 8 November 1993) was a British agricultural economist.

Retrieved 1 September 2016. He attended the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, graduating with a first class degree in agriculture; heavily influenced by Arthur Ashby, Wibberley went on to complete a master's degree at the Agricultural Economics Research Institute at Oxford. He then completed his PhD at Illinois University.  Career  = Government work = In 1940, Wibberley took up a year-long post as an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester. Alongside work in the Home Guard, from 1941 to 1943, he was District Officer (and then Assistant Executive Officer, 1943‚Äì44) for the East Sussex Agricultural Committee, tasked with maximising food production to meet wartime requirements. For five years from 1944 to 1949, Wibberley was an Assistant Rural Land Utilisation Officer with the Ministry of Agriculture, and subsequently a Research Officer in Land Use; he developed interpretations of the use of rural land which \\"became a challenge to the conventional orthodox of farming first\\", but became frustrated with the bureaucracy of the ministry. = Academia = In 1954, he was Head of the Department of Economics at Wye College, serving until 1969 (he was also Reader in Agricultural Economics from 1958 to 1962 and Professor of Rural Economy between 1963 and 1969). While there, he compiled a number of controversial but influential works, including Agriculture and Urban Growth (1959), which advocated for non-farming uses of land. In 1969, he took up the Ernest Cook Professorship of Countryside Planning, which was jointly based at University College, London, and Wye College. He left that post in 1982, the same year Bradford University conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Science degree, before he was appointed a Fellow of Wye College three years later. In the meantime, Wibberley had been President of the British Agricultural Economics Society (1975‚Äì76) and a Member of the Nature Conservancy Council (1973‚Äì80), amongst other directorships. He was called upon to give expert advice on many policy and planning programmes which touched upon his interests, including plans to build a third airport for London and to build and expand the new town of Milton Keynes. According to The Independent, \\"the teaching and research undertaken in his department embraced not only the traditional subjects of agricultural policy and farm business management, but also the conservation and socio-economics of the countryside and agrarian development in the Third World.\\" In his obituary, The Independent, \\"Though quintessentially an academic,\\" Wibberley \\"was a man of compassion ... his studies tended to focus on problems of rural deprivation ‚Äì as they affected farm and rural workers and rural youth. He gave much thought to the problems of creating rural employment and to the adverse impact of second homes on village life and economy.\\" He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1972. He was a capable public speaker and a lover of music. He married twice; firstly, in 1943, to Helen Yeomans, who died in 1963; and secondly, in 1972, to Peggy Samways. He died on 8 November 1993, having had a daughter by his first wife.

History In January 2013, Chris Constantinou developed in a discussion with Eugene Butcher, editor from the magazine Vive Le Rock, and Dave Collins the idea of an album set out to retrace the roots of punk, new wave and ska, featuring all-star punk musicians. It materialized in the creation of the musical supergroup The Mutants, with the first album, Rhythm and Punk Review, being released in July 2014. A subsequent album, Tokyo Nights, released in May 2015, had all the songs fronted by a rotating set of Japanese guest stars. The third album, Your Desert My Mind (October 2016), is a collaboration with Californian rock musicians from the desert rock scene. All the albums are released through Killer Tracks. With the third album having again a creative chemistry in a different musical area, The Mutants acquired the image of a band exploring unexpected musical genres, each album having a different musical flavour that reflects the territory, and the style of the musicians that contributed to it.\\"The Mutants, Your Desert My Mind\\", Classic Rock Society, November 2016 Rhythm and Punk Review (2014) The debut album Rhythm and Punk Review was written and produced by Chris Constantinou and Paul Frazer and recorded at Raezor Studion (now Sugar Cane Studios) in London.

It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize.  Background  The Hunger Triangle, a name relief organizations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other aid organizations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times.  Jo√£o Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan  = Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan = In March 1993 Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Jo√£o Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested to go. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \\"he felt trapped in\\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \\"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\\". To pay for the travel Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \\"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \\"The UN hoped to publish the famine‚Ä¶ Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for aid organizations to sustain funding\\". About the political differences and fighting \\"Jo√£o and Kevin knew none of this ‚Äì they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\\". = Waiting in Nairobi = Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region. But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. = In Ayod = The next day their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Jo√£o Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \\"Flies and Hungry People\\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Jo√£o Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \\"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was for Silva good news as, \\"their little UN plane was heading there next\\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking on his way pictures of children and people. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun ‚Äì he took a picture. Carter saw Silva on the runway and told him, \\"You won't believe what I've just shot! ‚Ä¶ I was shooting this kid on her knees, and then changed my angle, and suddenly there was this vulture right behind her! ‚Ä¶ And I just kept shooting ‚Äì shot lots of film! Silva asked him where he shot the picture and was looking around to take a photo as well. Carter pointed to a place away. Then Carter told him that he had chased the vulture away. He told Silva he was shocked by the situation he had just photographed, saying, \\"I see all this, and all I can think of is Megan\\", his young daughter. A few minutes later they left Ayod for Kongor. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \\"fevers\\", according to his family.  Publication and public reaction  In March 1993, The New York Times was seeking an image to illustrate a story by Donatella Lorch about the Sudan. Nancy Buirski, the newspaper's picture editor on the foreign desk, called Marinovich, who told her about \\"an image of a vulture stalking a starving child who had collapsed in the sand.\\" Carter's photo was published in the March 26, 1993 edition. The caption read: \\"A little girl, weakened from hunger, collapsed recently along the trail to a feeding center in Ayod. Nearby, a vulture waited.\\" This first publication in The New York Times \\"caused a sensation\\", Marinovich wrote, adding, \\"It was being used in posters for raising funds for aid organization. Papers and magazines around the world had published it, and the immediate public reaction was to send money to any humanitarian organization that had an operation in Sudan.\\" = Special editorial = Due to the public reaction and questions about the child's condition, The New York Times published a special editorial in its 30 March 1993 edition, which said in part, \\"A picture last Friday with an article about the Sudan showed a little Sudanese girl who had collapsed from hunger on the trail to a feeding center in Ayod. A vulture lurked behind her. Many readers have asked about the fate of the girl. The photographer reports that she recovered enough to resume her trek after the vulture was chased away. It is not known whether she reached the center.\\"  Awards  * Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography (1994) * Picture of the Year by The American Magazine  Aftermath  = Kevin Carter = Four months after being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography, Carter died of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on July 27, 1994, at age 33.

Early life and education He was born in Blackduck, Minnesota, the only child of Dr. Jay Monroe Freeburg and Bonita A Bryan. His father was the local dentist. After World War 1 the Freeburg family left Blackduck and moved to Minneapolis, where in 1924 he graduated from West High School. He then went on to attend the University of Minnesota, studying law. It was after having spent three years at the University of Minnesota that a classmate later recalled \\"on a spring day in 1926 airplanes popped into his head for no reason at all.\\" Early aviation and family life He bought a second-hand Canadian Curtis the next day. He left school and was trained to fly by the then well-known stunt pilot Vernon L \\"Vern\\" Roberts. He soloed on June 1, 1926. To celebrate he eloped with Ruth Evelyn Smith, of a prominent St. Paul family. He and Ruth took a flying honeymoon, believed to be the first in the area and possibly the nation, barnstorming through South Dakota and on to California for the winter. Along the way they would stop to visit relatives and Freeburg would take passengers for observation rides to pay their way covering some 35,000 miles. After the honeymoon he bought an old Army Surplus Bi-plane, (NC2405) Standard J-1, 13, and for a short time they established the Freeburg Flying Service in Shenandoah, Iowa. In 1927 new legislation banned the Standard J-1 as a passenger aircraft due to a high number of accidents but not before he set his first speed record on a trip from Thief River Falls, Minnesota, to Minneapolis in just three hours. He also earned 40 cents per minute taking a photographer up for photos over Ashland, Wisconsin. Mal became so well known the locals called him \\"Our Lindberg\\". Mal and Ruth joined other pilots and took on missionary work for aviation barnstorming the midwest. Air mail pilot and pioneer In 1928 they settled in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. By December he was hired by Charles W. Holman to fly for Northwest Airways, later called Northwest Airlines (NWA). He began his airline career flying the first airmail service to the Fox River Valley from Milwaukee to Green Bay, Wisconsin, in a single-engine open-cockpit biplane. By this time his pilot's log already showed more than 1,400 hours in the air. =Save the train from disaster= In 1929 he became one of the first pilots flying the airmail from Minneapolis-St Paul to Chicago at night in a four-hour schedule. It was on one of these very flights, July 12, 1930, along the Chippewa River, he spotted a train bridge ablaze and a train headed right for it. Freeburg left his flight path and began diving toward the train engine, crisscrossing its path near Trevino, Wisconsin, and dropping flares to signal the engineer of the trouble until the train came to a stop just 400 yards from the bridge. It turned out that amateur golfer Bobby Jones was one of the passengers on that train, on his way back to Atlanta after his victory in the U.S. Open at Interlachen. Mal became an instant hero, and with some fanfare he was thanked by the Burlington Railroad with a gold watch and a $100 reward from the Chicago Tribune. When Freeburg turned in his flight report the only mention of the event was that he needed a new supply of flares. On July 23, 1930, Ruth and Mal had their first child, James \\"Jim\\" Monroe Freeburg. It wasn't long after that Mal began taking little Jim up on his lap. By the time Jim was 13 he demanded his father teach him how to fly. =Motor falls off during flight= On 12 April 1931 flying his route between St. Paul and Chicago, shortly after leaving Minneapolis, a motor of Freeburg's tri-motored plane shook loose and tangled in the landing gear. Freeburg kept the plane aloft with the two remaining motors, flew to the Mississippi River and by maneuvering shook the tangled third motor into the river. He then returned to a nearby landing field and brought his plane with eight passengers and mail safely to the ground. They transferred the passengers and cargo to another aircraft and complete the flight on schedule. Seventeen days later he was recommended to receive a new medal. =Proving passenger flight over the Rockies= In 1933 he was on the NWA crew that proved passenger service over the Rockies in the winter was feasible. Amelia Earhart was also on that flight, mainly for PR purposes. Freeburg had flown her into the Twin Cities for the trip. Neither of them liked the other very much. On July 21, 1934, Ruth and Mal had their second child, Patricia Ruth Freeburg. In less than two months he has to make another emergency landing but had more time to prepare for this one. On September 19, 1934, flying a Lockheed Electra from Chicago, the landing gear failed to extend. He flew the aircraft over St. Paul for more than two hours to empty the fuel tanks before making an emergency landing with his 5 passengers safe and only slight damage to the plane. Test pilot and airline executive He and Ruth divorced and in 1936 he married Violet Melvina Morinville. He continued to fly for NWA and in 1938 made news once again, this time by successfully making a high-altitude flight from St. Paul to Billings and then on to Salt Lake City using a newly designed oxygen nose mask. He later flew a second test flight using the new mask with the group of inventors from the Mayo Clinic and his new wife as passengers. On March 10, 1938, NWA promoted him to superintendent of the Eastern Division. Soon millions of Americans would become familiar with Freeburg when General Mills puts out a series of Wheaties cereal boxes with the heroics of Freeburg and seven other brave airmail pilots that were awarded the Airmail Flyers' Medal of Honor. President FDR daily schedule for 13 December 1933 showing 11 AM appointment to present medal to Freeburg. President FDR presents Freeburg with first Airmail Flyers' Medal of Honor Medal from the President By 29 April 1932 President Herbert Hoover was prepared to present Freeburg with the first of a new air mail pilot's medal for Heroism after being recognized for his action of courage and resourcefulness on 12 April 1931 and prior on 12 July 1930. On 13 December 1933, at 11 AM in a ceremony held in the White House, the recently elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt would make the presentation of the first \\"Airmail Flyers' Medal of Honor\\" due to delays in the medal design and the presidential election. =Citation= ''' Mayor and foreign airmail In 1942 he ran for and was elected Mayor of Richfield but continued to fly for NWA. Twice he was promoted to an executive position, but he always insisted he continue as a pilot after his work was completed. During World War II he blazed the trail for a military route from Alaska along the Aleutian Islands. In 1948 he flew NWA's first flight of a Foreign Air Mail route, FAM-95, from Seattle, Washington, to Honolulu, Hawaii. This same year the most memorable aviation event of his life occurred when his son, Jim, joined him flying for NWA. The father-and-son pair made news flying with Mal as pilot and Jim as co- pilot. Mal remarked his only regret was that he wished Jim would call him Mal instead of Dad. Retirement and commemoration He retired in 1952 and died on the 10th of May 1963 at the age of 57. Freeburg was inducted in the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame in 1990.

It can respond to single keystrokes, and uses function keys to implement commands to the editor. EDT was introduced originally as a line- mode editor. The screen mode was developed first as the Keyboard Editor (KED) on RT-11 as part of the FMS-11 project by Darrell Duffy; EDT on the other operating systems was then enhanced to be compatible with KED. The editor contains both line mode commands and a screen based editor. In screen mode, the default action for the user is to directly update text as he or she types, with special commands available by pressing keypad commands. Arrow keys allow for simple navigation, while keypad commands allow for more complex navigation and searches. As with many user interfaces developed around this time, EDT uses the \\"Gold Key\\" style of input first developed for the WPS-8 word processing system. \\"Gold Key\\" editing uses the PF1 keypad key as a prefix key allowing the introduction of a wide variety of commands using both the keypad keys and keys on the main keyboard.

DEC later developed TPU, a powerful language for designing text editors on its VMS systems. TPU was used to produce a new standard text editor, EVE, as well as to rewrite EDT. EVE included an emulator of the EDT screen mode keypad for the benefit of those who were used to particular key functions.

The bridge was of great strategic importance, given that it was the only land accessible entrance to the islet of San Juan. It was located southeast of Fort√≠n de San Ger√≥nimo. General oblique view-east side of south end, from the Dos Hermanos Highway Bridge - Puente Guillermo Esteves, Spanning San Antonio Channel, in 1995 History Construction began in 1568 of the bridge which would link the islet of San Juan with the island of Puerto Rico. The bridge at this time was made of wood with a door with a permanent garrison. In 1595, 26 ships led by the privateer Sir Francis Drake attempted to land his forces near the coast of Escambron. Coastal defenses in Boqueron and the cannon batteries of San Antonio bridge repelled his landing attempt, forcing Drake‚Äôs armada to withdraw and attempt to enter San Juan Bay. The bay defenses ultimately thwarted his attack. In 1598, George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, attacked the islet of San Juan. The English forces managed land at El Boquer√≥n, and overwhelmed the Spanish defensive forces which had been debilitated by a recent dysentery outbreak. The English managed to lay siege to the city which subsequently surrendered. However, a disease outbreak which killed around 400 English troops forced the English to withdraw on 28 August. In 1776, the fortified bridge of San Antonio was replaced by a new reinforced structure designed by Thomas O'Daly. The structure is later remodeled in 1783 by Juan Francisco Mestre. Further strengthening of the bridgehead was done by Ignacio Mascaro and Homar in 1796. Both the fort of San Jeronimo as the fortified facilities San Antonio Bridge were instrumental in repelling the English attack of 1797 in which the English army, led by Sir Ralph Abercromby, sought to besiege the island of San Juan. The batteries of Fort San Antonio were heavily damaged by the impact of English cannon fire. See Battle of San Juan (1797). The reconstruction and renovation of Fort San Antonio was completed in 1800 in which a battery of two cannons was added. In peacetime, the fort was used as a tax control point for cattle ranchers. By 1822 the bridge was in great disrepair as well as the entire area including the fort of San Jeronimo and El Morro. Repairs were made under the leadership of Miguel de la Torre, who was serving as governor. In 1894, Governor Antonio Dab√°n ordered the demolition of the entire complex to build a new metal bridge into the islet of San Juan. The only remnants of Fort San Antonio which survive today is a small portion of a rampart which is visible between the new Guillermo Esteves bridge and Dos Hermanos Bridge.

He had his first art lessons in 1884 at the commercial studios of , a bookbinder and leather artisan.Brief biography @ Hamburger Pers√∂nlichkeiten, In 1890, he spent a year at the \\"Royal School of Applied Arts\\" in Munich.

Other notable early members included Julius von Ehren, , , , and Thomas Herbst, the eldest member. A common concern was to create an art school that would teach from life, rather than academically. In 1899, Siebelist created such a school and began holding classes en plein aire. His first students included Friedrich Ahlers- Hestermann, Franz N√∂lken, Fritz Friedrichs and Walter Alfred Rosam. His school received support from Ernst Rump, a wealthy businessman and art collector. In 1902, he painted what is probably his most familiar work \\"My Students and I\\".

It was developed by RCA for the TSOS operating system for Spectra series mainframes. The RCA version was later sold to Sperry Univac (which later became Unisys), and was released for the VS/9 operating system. The Univac/Fujitsu EDT editor is a line-based editor, in that it does not use function keys. Unlike editors such as Teco or Emacs, the program is always in text-entry mode, similar to today's word processors. Commands are sent to the editor by typing in text in the same manner as entering regular text, but the first character of the line (other than a space) is the command symbol, which defaults to the at sign (\\"@\\"). When a line begins with an @, the remainder of the line is used as a text-editing command. To enter a line of text beginning with @ which is not an editor command, it is necessary to prefix the line with a second @ sign, in which case, the first @ will be stripped off, and the line taken as text rather than a command. It is also possible to issue a command that the command indicator be changed from @ to a different character. One use for this feature is to write scripts to have EDT perform various actions upon another file. The command set of the editor includes the ability to create unattended programmable editing sessions through the use of test, comparison, branch and looping functions. If line numbers are not present in the original file, the editor supplies a pseudo-line number for use in editing each line. Because of the ISAM file format which supports an 8-character index key, line numbers consist of a floating-point number in the range of 0.0000 to 9999.9999. The usual line number supplied by EDT starts at 1.000 and is incremented by 1 as each new line was added. Lines can be inserted between other lines by using a fractional number as a command prefix. For example, line 1 of a file would be 1.0000, line 2 would be 2.0000, and to insert a line between 1 and 2, one could type @1.5: followed by the text of the line; the colon would be discarded and the line would be inserted at 1.5000, between 1 and 2. A renumber command is available to renumber all or part of the file. Commands in EDT generally consist of a command (which is case insensitive), which may be followed by a range of line numbers that the command was to act upon, and a subfunction indicating how the command is to act. The range was either expressed as a single line number, a range of lines separated by a dash, (e.g. 5-8 would mean any line numbered 5.0000 through 8.9999 inclusive), or a group of lines, each separated by a comma. Some symbols are available to represent various values, such as the ampersand \\"&\\" or the word \\"all\\" representing every line in the file. For example, to alter every \\"To\\" in a document to the word \\"From\\" you would type in @ON ALL CHANGE \\"To\\" TO \\"From\\" or @on & change \\"To\\" to \\"From\\" followed by the transmit key (equivalent to Enter on a PC), and the editor would perform the action. Editing was basically full-screen, with actions not taking place until the user pressed the transmit key, a procedure very similar to today's practice of entering text into an input box in a web page, with no action being taken until the user clicks on the submit button.Current (V17) PDF manuals for Fujitsu EDT editor (Retrieved 2013-08-08) Univac/Fujitsu's EDT editor provides extremely powerful editing capabilities, including *text formatting similar to Runoff (in which commands were given for text editing by preceding lines with a period) *possibly one of the first programs (the Univac 90/60 goes back to the late 1960s and early 1970s) to support the use of plugins to allow other programs to use the text the editor held in memory, as well as send commands back to the editor for processing. *sort *search *editing of plain text and files with line numbers *direct on- disk editing of files too large to hold in memory Fujitsu's current release of EDT also supports Unicode, which did not exist when Univac released its version of EDT.

He was the first West Indian to hold the position of administrator of Dominica, the first native Jamaican to serve as the island's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and the first representative of the Commonwealth to become the doyen of the Diplomatic Corps in London. The Times' obituary called him 'the most amiable and equable of High Commissioners, and if his clear-headedness and disinclination to become heated on matters of race and colour were a disappointment in some quarters, they won him widespread respect and admiration among those who were genuinely concerned with Commonwealth relations and the long-term interests of Jamaicans living in Britain.' He was a Rhodes Scholar at Keble College, Oxford, between 1931 and 1934, and won a Blue in the quarter-mile - the imperial equivalent of the 400 metres, an event in which his successor as High Commissioner, Arthur Wint, won Olympic gold in 1948. A press report of the 1934 Varsity competition described Lindo as a 'slim, wiry man who benefited from a following breeze.‚Äô In 1935 Lindo entered Her Majesty's Civil Service as Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools for Jamaica. Between 1952 and 1959 he was Administrator of Dominica, a tenure during which he radically improved the island's roads. In 1960 he became Secretary to the Governor of Jamaica, 'a key post where his understanding of both points of view helped complete an orderly and amicable transfer of power after 300 years of colonial rule.' His role in helping smooth the transition meant that he was a natural choice for the post of High Commissioner, which he took over in 1962 and would hold for 12 years. 'During this period, his advice on diplomatic niceties and the eccentricities of the British way of life were increasingly sought by the representatives of newly independent countries, though the quiet and refreshingly simple answers they got did not always accord with their expectations.' The Jamaican population in the UK swelled by more than 400,000 during Lindo's tenure as High Commissioner, and he made a point of frequently visiting Jamaican communities across the country and representing their cause in Whitehall and elsewhere. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1967, an OJ in 1973 and a GCVO in 1974. He married Holly Robertson Clacken, with whom he had two daughters, Judith (Judy) and Andrea (Andy). His two grandchildren, Boris Starling (b. 1969) and Belinda Starling (1972‚Äì2006), are writers.

He was the first secretary general of the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU).  Early Life  James Dennis \\"JD\\" Obong Akumu (7 August 1934 ‚Äì 15 August 2016) was born to Blasto Akumu and Patricia Abuya in Nyakach in the then Nyanza Province of Kenya. He was a Kenyan trade unionist and politician who was the MP for Nyakach from 1969 to 1973, and from 1992 to 1997.  Family and Education  Akumu was one of Blasto's seven children. His younger sister Asenath Bole Ogada was a novelist and publisher who promoted writing in Dholuo. James, fondly nicknamed JD, was born in Central Nyanza and educated at the Onjiko Secondary School in Kisumu before attending Aggrey Memorial High School near Kampala, Uganda. His stay in Uganda was cut short when he decided to return to Kenya to further his education at the Kenya Medical Training College in Nairobi from 1952‚Äì1954, with the intention of becoming a medical doctor. However, due to his calling to fight for Uhuru and because the state of Emergency occasioned by the Mau Mau Uprising, his education was interrupted. Soon afterwards, he took up a job as a laboratory technician at East African Breweries. It is while working at the brewery that he became active in the labor and trade union movement.  Akumu the Trade Unionist  His calling as an organizer and champion for workers' rights was honed when he joined the Distributive and Commercial Workers Union and . Shortly afterwards, he became the union's representative but due to his astute organizing activities and rising popularity within the union, he was dismissed with his superiors who felt threatened. He went on to work as the district organizer for staff of the Local Government Worker's Union in Nairobi. Unhappy with how workers in Kenya were treated, he became active in the trade unions and eventually politics. Akumu first met Trade Unionist and popular politician, Tom Joseph Mboya in 1952 while both were participants in a debate at the Mbagathi Postal Training Center. Mboya, who then worked as a Health Inspector at the Nairobi City Council had a massive influence on Akumu's career. Their friendship grew over time and became stronger when Mboya later became the Secretary General of the Kenya Federation of Labor. Akumu expanded his horizons and travelled with Mboya regionally in Africa but also to the US and Europe. In 1958 Tom Mboya sent Akumu to Accra, Ghana to attend the preparatory committee meeting of the All African People‚Äôs Conference where he met President Kwame Nkrumah, a man he greatly admired. That meeting solidified his commitment to Pan Africanism. Through the APC Dennis Akumu linked up to African leaders in the diaspora such as Philip Randolph, USA and Michael Manley of Jamaica and he honed his bridge building/ Pan African skills. He became Director of the Africa‚Äôs Workers Congress from 1964-1965. As Secretary General of the Dockworkers Union, headquartered in Mombasa, he fought for and oversaw the Africanization of the Port of Mombasa and the elevation of African workers to supervisory positions hereto for held by Europeans. He also negotiated better wages and terms of employment for all. He worked tirelessly and leaving the Dockworkers Union was very difficult for him but he was called to Nairobi to lead the Central Organization of Trade Unions. In 1965, Dennis Akumu joined the Central Organization of Trade Unions of Kenya as a Deputy General Secretary. Akumu later became COTU (K)‚Äôs Secretary General from 1969 through 1975 and a founding Secretary General of the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity, OATUU based in Accra, Ghana in 1973.  Politics  In 1957, a political alliance was spawned when he supported Tom Mboya's successful political campaign. As a result, they formed the People's Convention Party of Kenya for which he was the first Organizing Secretary and later became the Secretary General. His charisma, oratory and organizing skills were recognized by Mboya who was head of the Kenya Federation of Labor. In 1958, Mboya encouraged Akumu to accept the position of the General Secretary of the Mombasa Dock Workers' Union, a position he cherished and was rewarded for by being reelected four times to serve for ten years. In 1960, Akumu won a seat and served as the first of the four Africans in the Mombasa City Council for two years. While attending the All African People‚Äôs conference in Tunisia in 1960, due to the polarizing positions at Lancaster House constitutional conference he was airlifted from the Tunisia meeting to London to serve as the so called a ‚Äúbackroom man‚Äù to help reach compromise on the type of constitution Kenya would adopt. He was called to share his expertise, experience and make recommendations in 2001 at the Mombasa Workshop at a session with Lancaster House constitution Making veterans; in 2003 at the Plenary Proceedings, Presentation at Lancaster House held at the Bomas of Kenya; and as an Observer during the historic Constitution of Kenya Review Commission National Constitution conference in 2005. Akumu was first detained by the Kenyatta government in 1966 for almost a year owing to his involvement in politics. In 1990, he was detained again, this time by the Moi government for a fortnight as a result of his passionate campaign and support for the return of multi-party democracy in Kenya under the Forum for Restoration of Democracy (FORD) banner. In 1969, he was elected Member of Parliament for Nyakach constituency under the one party system of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and served until 1973. He was again elected the Member of Parliament for the same constituency in 1992-1997 on a FORD-Kenya ticket. He was honored to represent the people of Nyakach in Parliament and as Member of Parliament, he worked for and attained improvements for his constituents as is fondly remembered for improving roads, broadening access to piped water, ensuring better health services and facilitating access to higher education through his international networks to the United States, Europe, Asia and across Africa. Akumu worked tirelessly to unite Africans, narrow ideological differences, restore African workers' dignity and resist forces of exploitation for Africa's independence. In the spirit of Pan-Africanism, he reached out to and built bridges in North America, Latin America and the Caribbeans. Among his many other achievements was his work in strengthening the anti-Apartheid movement and the fight for liberation for all Africans through the OAU and UN mechanisms. Akumu was instrumental in the reburial of President Kwame Nkrumah and the establishment of the WEB Dubois Center in Accra, Ghana.

Bish started his career with PSV in 1967 where he became the club's youngest ever debutant. During the course of his career he had spells across the Eredivisie and won the 1973 KNVB Beker with NAC Breda in 1973. He later had a short stint in Belgium with Berchem Sport before returning to the Netherlands where he retired in 1981. Club career Bish played at amateur level with Megacles and Wilhelmina '08 where he was spotted by PSV. He was handed his debut for the club at the age of 16 years and 102 days, thereby becoming PSV's youngest ever player. Upon making his debut, Bish also became the Eredivisie's second youngest-ever player, after Wim Kras of Volendam. He has since been surpassed by Mark van Bommel who made his debut for Fortuna Sittard in 1992 aged 16 years and 23 days. Bish made seven appearances for PSV between 1967 and 1969 when he was signed by DWS. He stayed only one season at the club, scoring 2 goals in 13 league appearances before joining NAC Breda in 1970. Bish's only title came during his stint in Breda where he scored the opening goal in a 2‚Äì0 win over N.E.C. to lift the 1972‚Äì73 KNVB Cup. He amassed 73 appearances for NAC between 1970 and 1973, scoring 23 goals before departing for newly promoted Eredivisie side Roda JC. Bish stated that he had joined Roda as a result of NAC failing to meet his contract demands. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì1 loss to MVV Maastricht on 12 August 1973. The goal was historic in that it was Roda's first ever goal in the Eredivisie. He became an immensely popular figure at the club and netted 24 goals in 64 appearances between 1973 and 1975. Bish then took the opportunity to double his wages with Berchem Sport in Belgium. He later revealed that it had been a mistake to leave Roda. He had seen the move to Belgium as an opportunity to eventually play for Anderlecht or Club Brugge but managed only six goals across all competitions for Berchem. After one season he sought to return to Roda and even underwent a medical but the deal never went through. Instead he joined FC Wageningen where he spent two seasons, scoring 21 goals in 67 appearances. During his time with Wageningen, Bish was part of an historic win over PSV where he scored in a 6‚Äì1 cup win over his former side. He left the club in 1978 where he spent the final years of his career at VVV-Venlo, scoring 19 goals in 62 appearances before retiring in 1981 at the age of 30.

He also acted as a linguist and journalist, was chairman of the Masica Serbska organization and co-founder of the Sorbian umbrella organization Domowina in 1911.Stone, Gerald. 2015. Slav Outposts in Central European History: The Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs. Bloomsbury Publishing. ≈†wjela advocated the preservation of Sorbian language and culture in Lower Lusatia. Life After ≈†wjela had in 1898 completed his theological studies, he sought a long time for a pastoral position in Lower Lusatia. Beginning in 1904, he was curate at the Wendish church in Cottbus, where he preached regularly in Lower Sorbian, rather than in German. His ordination took place at a time when the oppression of Sorbian language and culture by the Prussian authorities peaked. Education in Sorbian at the Friedrich- Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Cottbus was stopped in 1888 and later religious instruction in the language was also stopped. The older Sorbian intellectuals were initially paralyzed. ≈†wjela, of the nationally conscious young Sorbian movement, was motivated strongly to work for the cultural interests of the Sorbs. Things came to a head in the Cottbus parish where he continued to minister in Sorbian. In 1908, Swjela had to leave the city because he had refused to hold sermons in German only. He was then several years as vicar in Nochten before he came to the Dissen parish in 1913. ≈†wjela's father, Kito ≈†wjela (1836‚Äì1922), had edited the Lower Sorbian newspaper Bramborski Serbski casnik beginning in 1864.Stone, Gerald. 2015. Slav Outposts in Central European History: The Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs. Bloomsbury Publishing. Following in his father's journalistic footsteps, ≈†wjela wrote for the Lower Sorbian newspapers and magazines Pratyja, Bramborski Casnik, and Wo√üadnik, whose main author was himself. He founded the series Serbska knig≈Çownja (Sorbian Library), in which he published especially poetry but also published literary, religious and popular scientific works by different authors. ≈†wjela published his textbooks for teaching the Lower Sorbian language in two parts, in 1906 and 1911. ≈†wjela succeeded in motivating young Sorbs in his region to work on behalf of their traditional national cultural work. He strengthened them in their self-image by contacts in the Sorbian core areas of Upper Lusatia. In 1912 ≈†wjela co-founded the Sorbian umbrella organization Domowina. He suggested the name for the association, and was also elected Deputy Chairman. In the interwar period ≈†wjela collected the Sorbian geographical name in the Cottbus area and worked on a Lower Sorbian dictionary. Neither work was allowed to be printed until after his death. With the increased power of the National Socialists (Nazis) from 1933 onward, the pressure on the small Slavic minority in Germany increased. The imposition of prohibitions of Sorbian language and some cultural expression began in Domowina in 1937, initiating open persecution of Sorbian life. From that year onward, no publications in Sorbian were allowed to be published. While in most Protestant congregations, services were not held in Sorbian, ≈†wjela refused to be intimidated. During the Nazi era, he led in the renovation of the church in Dissen, where the Sorbian quotations were again painted on the balcony. He preached in Dissen and Sielow in Sorbian, even though this was forbidden. On April 7, 1941, the Gestapo informed the leading Wendish pastor that all the Wendish pastors' association had been dissolved and its assets seized.Stone, Gerald. 2015. Slav Outposts in Central European History: The Wends, Sorbs and Kashubs. Bloomsbury Publishing. Hymn singing, teaching, and preaching was required to be in German, both officially and in private. Therefore, ≈†wjela was forced to retire and was banished from the Lower Sorbian area of Lusatia to Rudolstadt. In his exile, ≈†wjela remained committed to the Sorbian cause. Together with earlier companions, including the journalist Mina Witkojc and the painter Fritz Lattke, he developed an important foundation for the revival of the Lower Sorbian culture in the postwar period. In 1946 he was involved in the re-establishment of the Lower Sorbian branch of Domowina and since 1947 he was editor of the Lower Sorbian newspaper Nowy Casnik. Before he found a new apartment in the Lower Sorbian region, ≈†wjela died in 1948 from a stroke on a railway journey from Rudolstadt to Cottbus. In Cottbus, a street was named in his honor him.

Construction Made of brick, construction of the building began in 1888 and completed 1890 on land owned jointly by the university and Iowa City. The cost of construction was supplemented through a contribution of $10,000 by Mrs. Helen S. Close in order for the YM-YWCA to be completed. The three-story building was the site of the first five-on-five college basketball game in 1896. The basement of the building housed the women's gymnasium as well as industrial chemistry labs. The first floor contained offices and recitation rooms, while the second floor housed literary societies as well as additional offices.University of Iowa Libraries University Archives The building became the first home of the Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team in its early years. The team would move to the first Iowa Armory in 1905. Eventually the building would become the school of journalism for the University of Iowa and would house the campus typesetting machines and printing presses. It would be from these presses that The Daily Iowan, The Hawkeye, Frivol, Iowa Literary Magazine, The Transit and The Journal of Business would be printed. Close Hall would remain the home of the school of journalism as well as the university press room until the late 1950s. =Fire, rebuild and demolition= On January 1, 1940, Close Hall had a devastating fire that caused irreparable damage. The building was reconstructed as a one-story building and maintained as the school of journalism and university publishing. After the university publishing left, Close Hall became an underused, gaudy building on a valuable piece of property. The university officially closed the building in 1968 and over the course of the following two years demolished the structure. Today, the University of Iowa's Biology Building East stands on the Close Hall former site at Dubuque Street and Iowa Avenue.https://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/studio/2008/04/ References Iowa Hawkeyes basketball venues Sports venues in Iowa University of Iowa campus Defunct college basketball venues in the United States 1890 establishments in Iowa Basketball venues in Iowa Sports venues completed in 1890 1970 disestablishments in Iowa Buildings and structures demolished in 1970 ","title":"Close Hall"},{"id":"51488947","text":"Faraday House Faraday House Electrical Engineering College was created to train engineers in power generation and distribution.

While working at the Savoy, she invented the \\"Hanky Panky‚Äù, a cocktail. Early life Coleman was born in 1875, the daughter of a steward at Rupert D'Oyly Carte's golf club. When she was twenty-four, her father died, and D'Oyly offered her a job at one of his hotels, first in the flower shop then in the bar at Claridge's hotel. Around the time that Coleman began working as a bartender, according to a study published in 1905, slightly less than half the bartenders in London were women. \\"Barmaids\\", as they were called, were usually the daughters of tradesmen or mechanics or, occasionally, young women from the \\"better-born\\" classes who had been \\"thrown upon their own resources\\" and needed an income. Though the hours were long, many women saw the job as less monotonous and potentially more lucrative than other professions that were available to them. However, campaigns were underway at that time to eliminate the barmaid as a profession for women, because of perceptions that the job was bad for them and for society, physically and morally. Coleman, at twenty-four, was nearly at the age ceiling for entry level female bartenders, as many bars and pubs specified no one over 25 need apply.Lord Bishop of Southwark, Joint Committee on the Employment of Barmaids, Women As Barmaids, PS King and Son, London, 1905, p. 10 In an interview with the London Express, Coleman remembered that the first mixed drink she made was a Manhattan, and that she was coached by Fisher, the Claridge's Wine Butler on how to make it. At the Savoy New Year's Eve at the Savoy Hotel 1907 Coleman was promoted to head bartender of the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in 1903.Curtis, Daily Beast Though Coleman is sometimes cited as the first and only female head bartender at the Savoy,Emma Bryce, \\"The Famous Female Mixologist You‚Äôve Never Heard Of\\", Modern Notion, March 16, 2015/ there was already another woman tending bar, Ruth Burgess, known as \\"Miss B\\" or \\"Kitty\\", who started in 1902. Newspaper accounts say they were equally popular with customers, but it was Coleman who was interviewed when she retired and who later found her way into 20th and 21st century histories of cocktails and bartending. One account says the two women worked separate shifts for twenty years without speaking to one another because Coleman had refused to give Burgess the recipes for her popular drinks. American bars, and the diverse cocktails they served, had become popular in England in the late 19th century, and were a selling point for any establishment that had them during Coleman's era.Curtis, Daily Beast l Coleman quickly developed a reputation for being a talented bartender and consummate hostess to the notable and affluent clientele of the Savoy. The Earl of Lonsdale wrote that \\"she was so nice and so kind and so full of life and energy.\\" Other clients who drank at Coleman's bar included Mark Twain, Marlene Dietrich, Charlie Chaplin, Diamond Jim and the Prince of Wales. \\"Coley.\\" as her customers nicknamed her, was an \\"impresario\\" behind the bar, according to cocktail historian Ted Hughes. \\"Not only was Coley‚Ä¶a woman in the world of male bartenders,\\" he said, \\"it was she who made the bar famous.\\" A lover of musical theatre, she also gave parties at her home which were attended by a diverse crowd of people. The Hanky Panky The Hanky Panky cocktail Coley was known as a mixologist who enjoyed creating new drinks. Charles Hawtrey, a comedic actor, and, according to Coley, \\"one of the best judges of cocktails that I knew,\\" used to come into the bar and say, \\"Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.' Coleman recalled. ‚ÄúIt was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail,\\" she said. \\"The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said 'By Jove! This is the real hanky-panky!' The name hanky panky, which in England meant at that time 'magic', or 'witchcraft' stuck with the drink, a combination of gin, vermouth and Fernet Branca, which is still served in the American Bar at the Savoy today, as well as listed in cocktail manuals. Retirement In late 1925, the Savoy shut down the American Bar for renovations and announced the retirement of Coleman and Ruth Burgess. They were replaced by the naturalised American Harry Craddock, who had worked the service bar for five years while the women worked the front bar. Craddock later wrote The Savoy Cocktail Book, which included Coleman's recipe for the Hanky Panky. In February 1926, five London newspapers published the story of Coley's retirement from bartending. In an interview with The London Daily Express, who called her \\"England's most famous barmaid\\" and The Queen of Cocktail Mixers\\", Coleman estimated she had served one hundred thousand customers and poured one million drinks.London Express article reprinted in Mixer and Server, Volume 35, Hotel and Restaurant Employee's International Alliance and Bartenders' International League of America., 1926 After Coleman left the bar, some cocktail historians have said she worked in the hotel's flower shop.Alice Lascelles ,Ten Cocktails: The Art of Convivial Drinking Hodder & Stoughton, Apr 23, 2015 However, in 2016, Susan Scott, the archivist at the Savoy said she found no evidence of that. In Coleman's later life she took a part-time job managing the staff in the ladies' cloakroom at The Berkeley hotel. Death and legacy Coleman died in 1966, at the age of 91. In 2016, Liquor.com listed her as one of the nine most important bartenders of all time, and bartenders at the Savoy still spoke of her as an 'iconic legend'. The Hanky Panky is now served worldwide. In 2015, it was listed by Drinks International as one of the top 50 best-selling cocktails. At the Savoy, it is served in two versions: the original Coleman recipe along with an upgraded version which is aged in oak barrels and includes several different kinds of vermouth and gin. In 2018, a cocktail bar and lounge named Ada's Place opened in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City. The name is tribute to Coleman.

Tolstoy. In tandem with Stanislavski, Sanin also co-directed Tsar Ioannovich, along with several other productions with the fledgling company, including The Sunken Bell by Gerhart Hauptmann (1898), The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare (1898), Men Above the Law by Alexey Pisemsky (1898), The Death of Ivan the Terrible by A.K.

(–°. 406‚Äî407) That same year, following a disagreement with Stanislavski over the re-organization of the company (which had also prompted the departure of Vsevolod Meyerhold), Sanin moved to the Alexandrinsky Theatre. He remained there until 1907, working as an actor, director, and acting teacher, during which time he sought to propagate Stanislavski's ideas within that company. He directed a number of plays by Alexander Ostrovsky with the Alexandrinsky, including The False Dmitry and Vasily Shuysky, An Ardent Heart and Stay in Your Own Sled. In 1907, Sanin left the Alexandrinsky to join Sergey Dyagilev's European troupe. There, now working mainly as an opera director, he concentrated on the classics of Russian music and staged several successive opera productions, including Boris Godunov at the Grand Opera in Paris, with Fyodor Chalyapin in the lead. In 1913, Sanin joined the newly formed Mardzhanov's Free Theatre and in 1914‚Äì1915 he was the stage director of the Moscow Drama Theatre.Sanin's biography at the MAT site.

Biography  Cornelius was born in Lichtenburg, South Africa, and grew up in rural South Africa as one of nine children. Her father and grandfather both fought in the Anglo Boer War and her mother was held in a concentration camp during the war. She and her older sister, Hester Cornelius, moved to Johannesburg in the 1920s, where Johanna eventually started working in a garment factory. Cornelius worked as a machinist in the factory. Cornelius was arrested and detained in jail for several house in 1932 while participating in a GWU strike. After she was released from jail, she spoke to the workers and encouraged them to \\"demand a living wage and freedom.\\" Her speech also referenced the Great Trek and the Anglo Boer War, joining \\"nationalism together with the class struggle rather than with the national struggle.\\" She went to the Soviet Union as part of a workers' delegation in 1933. Her trip there helped her learn more about communism and a sense of social equality. When she returned from the Soviet Union, she became a full-time union organizer for GWU, working from the main office in Germiston. Cornelius worked as the GWU president from 1935 to 1937 and under her leadership, the union won reduced working hours and increased wages for workers. Cornelius worked to include people of all backgrounds in the union and felt that working in the union had helped her \\"transcend the racial attitudes\\" of her past. She and Hester also traveled to Cape Town in February 1936 help the GWU branch there. Cornelius was accused in 1938 of being a \\"communist accomplice of Sachs and for spending all her time organising black people.\\" However, she was able to successfully fight off attempts by Afrikaner nationalists who wanted to take control of the union. She became a founder of the National Union of Cigarette and Tobacco Workers in 1938, later leading a two-week strike in Rustenburg in September 1940. The strike in Rustenberg was \\"heated\\" and women in the strike faced tear gas and police attacks. In 1943 she ran unsuccessfully as an Independent Labor Party candidate. When Solly Sachs was exiled from South Africa in 1952, she took over the GWU and worked that position until her death. Cornelius died on June 21, 1974, in Johannesburg.

The three chapter long story was first published by Shueisha Publishing Company in 1998. The storyline discusses yuri and transgender topics.  Characters  Maho Ryoutarou is a trans woman starring in the series. She is described as being feminine, tall, and beautiful in the three chapters. She works at a place called Bar Arthur with other transgender females. Maho often discusses the difficulties she faces in her life because of her identity as a Trans woman. Fujiko Kouzu is a young girl from a rich family. Because of poor family dynamics, she lies to her parents about studying abroad in Switzerland when she is really working and going to school near home. Soon upon meeting Maho, Fujiko falls in love with her but continues to act in a platonic manner towards her. She begins cutting her hair progressively shorter during the second chapter of the manga. Koko-Chan is first introduced in the third chapter. She is another trans woman who works at Bar Arthur with Maho.  Plot  The first chapter shows how Maho and Fujiko meet and develop a relationship. One night Fujiko is harassed on the street by a male stranger and Maho scares him off. After this encounter, the two realize that they live in the same building. Their friendship further develops a few nights later when Fujiko finds Maho drunk and unconscious in their apartment stairwell. Maho discovers the Fujiko comes from a wealthy family from a picture in an old magazine. After Maho confronts Fujiko about this, Fujiko admits that she has fallen in love with Maho. In the second chapter Fujiko begins to cut her hair shorter. Maho's coworkers find out about her friendship with Fujiko and berate her about their relationship being inappropriate. Maho quickly settles the matter, explaining that there is no inappropriate conduct taking place. Maho notices that a man is following her and Fujiko around the city, and confronts him after a day of shopping. The man is Fujiko's former fianc√© who was stalking her because she had previously cut off their engagement. At one point when they are alone, Fujiko tells Maho that she reminds her of her sister. However, when the ex-fianc√© returns drunkenly to Maho's place of work, he tells her that Fujiko does not and never had a sister. This mystery is not resolved. The third chapter is less focused on Maho and Fujiko. Instead, the story revolves around one of Maho's coworkers named Koko-chan. In the beginning of the chapter Koko-chan does not come to work and it is noted by another coworker that she went through a breakup. Maho is asked to visit her, so she goes the next day with Fujiko. Koko-chan tells them that she plans to return to work in a few days. When she does return, however, Koko-chan brings an abandoned infant that she found in a park with her, claiming it to be her own. Maho spends a significant portion of the chapter trying to convince Koko- chan to turn the child over to the authorities. Once the child has been returned, Maho and Fujiko discuss the complications with having children while Trans. Towards the end of the chapter, Fujiko runs into Koko-chan on the street, and Koko-chan tells her that she plans to go out into the world to help children in need elsewhere.

It was built in 1891 by shearers on strike. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Shearers' Strike camp site was the focus of the 1891 confrontation between capital and labour in the pastoral industry. Although the strike was not successful and some leaders were gaoled, the event had major political consequences. In the following year the first endorsed representative of labour was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly and the strike was a key factor in the formation of the Australian Labor Party. Barcaldine sprang up in 1886 as the terminus of the Central Western Railway from Rockhampton. The area was already settled by pastoralists and had previously been centred on Blackall. Large sheep stations were like small townships with their own working facilities, stores, workers' accommodation and tradesmen such as blacksmiths. The owners and managers of such properties had considerable power to dictate terms to an itinerant workforce recruited for the shearing season. Poor working conditions, low pay and the threat of competition from cheap foreign labour caused discontent within the industry. Barcaldine was a natural focus for the development of unionism. As the railhead, the town drew many seasonal and casual workers. Besides shearers and hands there were navvies who had worked on the construction of the railway and carriers who had found their work reduced by it. Difficulties in finding work and financial hardship helped to build a sense of mateship and mutual support amongst sections of them. In 1887 the Central Queensland Carriers Union was formed at Barcaldine and the Queensland Shearers' Union at Blackall. Within a year it had 1300 members, indicating a perceived need for collective bargaining to obtain fair terms and working conditions. In 1888 the Central Queensland Labourers' Union was formed at Barcaldine. These three unions were the driving force behind the strike of 1891. In Brisbane, the Trades and Labour Council was formed in 1885 and in 1889 became the Australian Labour Federation. At Barcaldine in the same year the Pastoral Employers' Association was founded and introduced reduced rates of pay. Many workers now joined unions and only severe wet weather in 1890 delayed a confrontation. By January 1891 union representatives had gathered at Barcaldine for meetings and pastoralists were trying to circumvent union rules by pressing shearers to sign freedom of contract forms. A strike was called and employers began to import non-union labour from the south. In February strikers, a number of whom were armed, gathered at Barcaldine. Library tent at the camp, 1891 Although camps were set up during the course of the strike from Cloncurry to the New South Wales border, the focus was on Barcaldine and the main camp on the southern bank of Lagoon Creek is said to have held up to 1000 strikers, some of whom were accompanied by their families. They were well organised and set up tents in rows with a cleared area between. Strikers were issued with food, soap, tobacco and salt and an oven made of ant bed was constructed to provide fresh bread. Provision was even made for recreation with a library tent set up and games such as cricket being played. Feelings amongst the strikers ran high and a tree was blazed on the north eastern edge of the camp and painted with the words \\"United we stand. Divided we fall. A.L.F. the strike camp 1891 W. Vincent, E Car...\\". Card celebrating shearers as Unionist Prisoners after the shearers strike in Barcaldine The Queensland Government responded to the crisis by sending police and soldiers and the strikers drilled and staged torchlight processions in the town, where there was considerable support for them. In March 1891 the situation escalated as carriers and railway workers went out in sympathy and military reinforcements arrived. Barcaldine became the focus of the whole country's interest and armed conflict was expected. Towards the end of March an old law was used to arrest all members of the strike committee for conspiracy. With the leaders gone, heavy rain and sickness in the camp and with the shearing season underway using labour brought in under military escort, the strikers began to disperse. The strike leaders were tried and most received heavy sentences. On June 15, the strike was officially called off. Although the strike had failed, it had far reaching effects. In the following year, Thomas Joseph (Tommy) Ryan (not to be confused with Thomas Joseph Ryan, Premier of Queensland 1915-1919) became the first endorsed labour candidate to be elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Because the strike unified the labour movement it was a key event in the formation of the Australian Labor Party. The strike has retained a central place in the history and mythology of Barcaldine. In 1982 a re-enactment of the strike using townspeople was staged. In 1987 a committee was formed to commemorate the strike and set up a granite and bronze monument near the famous Tree of Knowledge where workers met at the Barcaldine railway station. In 1988 an archaeological survey was carried out by Brian Egloff of Australian National University to accurately identify the correct location of the camp site. In 1991 a detailed survey and excavations were carried out. Artefacts found dating to the strike include metal containers, bottles, ammunition and horse and shearing equipment. The most visible artefact of the strike is the remains of the ant bed camp oven. The centenary of the strike in 1991 was a major event which drew Labor politicians from around the country and saw the opening of the Workers' Heritage Centre.  Description  Shearers' camp, 1891 The campsite is approximately north east of Barcaldine and situated on the south side of Lagoon Creek. It is lightly treed, mainly with gidgee, and the only visible evidence of its use during the Shearers' Strike is the remains of a camp oven made of ant bed, a blazed tree and a light artefact scatter, some of which is subsequent to the strike. The strikers were not the first people to camp on this site and Egloff observed and recorded artefacts from previous Aboriginal use of the site. It has also since been used for camping by drovers. The blazed tree, a coolabah, is on the north-eastern margin of the camp site. The main stem of the tree is dead, but it has put out a limb from the base which, when inspected in November 2000, was growing reasonably well. It received assessment and treatment from a tree surgeon in 1993. The blaze at the base of the trunk cut in 1891 has grown over to some extent but is still clearly visible although the inscription can no longer be seen.  Heritage listing  Shearers' Strike Camp Site, Barcaldine was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Shearers' Strike Camp Site was the focus of the 1891 Shearers' Strike, a confrontation between capital and labour that was a major event in Queensland's history. The strike was a watershed in the development of organised representation of labour in Australia and the formation of the Australian Labor Party. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Strike Camp Site has the potential to provide evidence of the material culture of shearers' lives in the late 19th century. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Strike Camp Site is closely linked with the cultural identity of Barcaldine and has a strong association with its people, many of whom are descended from participants in this event. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Shearers' Strike Camp Site at Barcaldine has a special association with the history of the Australian Labor Party and with Trades Union in Queensland. It also has a special association with the life and work of William Hamilton and George Taylor, convicted strike leaders who went on to become prominent Labor politicians, and with many of the other participants in this event.

Tucker teaches in the joint Master's program in religion and ecology at Yale between the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and the Divinity School. She also has an appointment at Yale's Department of Religious Studies. She has authored and edited close to 20 volumes and has published hundreds of articles. She is a pioneer in the field of religion and ecology. She is the granddaughter of Carlton J.H. Hayes, noted European historian at Columbia University and Ambassador to Spain in WWII under Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As an author, she is largely held in libraries worldwide. She teaches a MOOC (massive open online course) specialization of three courses on Journey of the Universe and ‚ÄúThe Worldview of Thomas Berry.‚Äù Early life and education Mary Evelyn Tucker was born in New York City, the daughter of William D. Tucker, Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Hayes Tucker. She has a B.A. in English from Trinity College (now known as Trinity Washington University) and a master's degree from State University of New York at Fredonia in English. She also studied literature and history at Oxford University. After teaching for two years at Notre Dame University in Japan and studying at Sophia University in Tokyo she received an MA from Fordham University in History of Religions. Her PhD is in Asian religions from Columbia University where she specialized in Confucianism in China and Japan. She has published five books on Confucianism. She has been an Associate in Research at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University since 1997. =Thomas Berry= Tucker studied world religions in graduate school with noted cultural historian, Thomas Berry (well known for his 1988 volume, The Dream of the Earth, originally published by Sierra Club Books). She worked closely with Berry for 35 years and has edited a number of his books including Evening Thoughts, The Sacred Universe, Christian Future and The Fate of Earth, and Selected Writings on the Earth Community. She and her husband John Grim together carry on the legacy of Thomas Berry through their work in religion and ecology and the Journey of the Universe. They are managing trustees of the Thomas Berry Foundation. In 2019, Tucker, Grim, and Andrew Angyal published Thomas Berry: A Biography (Columbia University Press). =The Forum on Religion and Ecology= With the vision of creating a new field of study that could have implications for environmental policy, Tucker and Grim organized a series of ten conferences on World Religions and Ecology at the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard University (1995-1998). Ten volumes came out of the conferences (series editors: Tucker and Grim) and are distributed by Harvard University Press. After the conferences, she and Grim founded the Forum on Religion and Ecology at a culminating event at the United Nations and American Museum of Natural History in 1998, which featured such notables as Maurice Strong, Bill Moyers, Tim Wirth, and Tu Weiming. The Forum has organized dozens of conferences, published numerous volumes, and produced a comprehensive website on world religions and ecology. It is the largest international multi- religious project of its kind. The Forum is inherently interdisciplinary and acknowledges that the world's religions must engage with other key disciplines (e.g., public policy, science, education, economics) in order to find answers to contemporary environmental challenges. Twenty years ago the field of religion and ecology did not exist. Today there are courses taught at colleges and secondary schools across North America, Europe, and Australia. And a powerful surge of religious environmentalism has emerged globally in churches, temples, synagogues, and mosques. Statements have been issued by every major religion regarding the importance of environmental protection. The Forum on Religion and Ecology has been an integral part of these worldwide developments. To this end Tucker has spoken at conferences around the world, including the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Vatican Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the Global Forum, Earth Charter International Conferences, and the Parliament of World Religions. =Journey of the Universe= With evolutionary philosopher, Brian Thomas Swimme, Mary Evelyn Tucker created Journey of the Universe, a multi-media project that carries forward much of Berry's work. The project includes the widely acclaimed Journey of the Universe film, which won a regional Emmy Award for ‚ÄúOutstanding Achievement: Documentary‚Äù and aired on PBS stations across the U.S. for three years. The Journey film was directed by David Kennard (one of the directors and senior producers of Carl Sagan‚Äôs Cosmos and Jacob Bronowski‚Äôs Ascent of Man) and Patsy Northcutt. There is also a book by the same name from Yale University Press and a series of 20 ‚ÄúConversations‚Äù on DVD and podcasts‚Äîinterviews conducted by Tucker with leading environmentalists, scientists, educators, and historians. Journey was deeply inspired by Thomas Berry‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúThe New Story,‚Äù which looked at how humanity is in between stories‚Äîthe religious creation stories and the scientific story of the evolution. Tucker and Swimme came together to craft this epic narrative designed to communicate our intricate connection to the cosmos and Earth to a broader audience. The Journey film was the winner of Best Documentary at the Northern California Emmy¬Æ Awards (2011); winner of the Global Award and received Merit awards for both Scientific Information and Cinematography at the Montana CINE International Film Festival (2012); winner of the Sierra Nevada Award at the Mountain Film Festival; winner of the El Capitan Award at the Yosemite International Film Festival; chosen as one of the featured films at the Environmental Film Festival in the Nation's Capital; an official selection at the Wild and Scenic Film Festival; received an Honorable Mention at the Columbus International Film Festival; and received the Award of Excellence at the Indie Fest. Awards and Service Mary Evelyn Tucker has been a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award in religion and ecology, the Inspiring Yale Teaching Award, the Thomas Berry Award, the Chancellor's Medal/Joint and Common Future Award (University of Massachusetts, Boston), the Unitas Distinguished Alumna Award (Union Theological Seminary), the Interfaith Visionary Award, the Faith in Action Award, the Hudson Valley Hero Award, Spiritearth Award, Centennial Alumnae Award for Academic Excellence (Trinity College), among others. Tucker has been an integral part of the Earth Charter since its initial inception. From 1997-2000, she served on the International Earth Charter Drafting Committee, chaired by Steven Rockefeller, and she was also a member of the Earth Charter International Council. She currently serves on the Advisory Boards of Orion Magazine, Solutions Magazine, the Garrison Institute, and Green Belt Movement U.S., dedicated to the work and legacy of Wangari Maathai. Since 1979 Tucker has served as vice-president of the American Teilhard Association, dedicated to the legacy of scientist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard deChardin Personal life Mary Evelyn Tucker is married to Yale professor John Grim, an expert on Native American traditions and author of The Shaman.

History  left Irving Street Kitchen was opened by restaurateurs Doug Washington, Mitch Rosenthal, and Steve Rosenthal. Washington and the Rosenthal brothers knew each other from working at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant Postrio, and had previous success with other restaurants they operated in San Francisco. Wanting to expand their restaurant group, the three partners sought out another city to expand to. According to Washington, he settled on opening a restaurant in Portland because he felt like the city's atmosphere matched with his and the other owners' tastes. Originally conceptualized under the temporary name of Crane Tavern, Washington and the Rosenthals envisioned a restaurant that had \\"a local-farmer bent, Southern undertones and a taste of American regional food, with our sensitivities\\". The three of them signed a minimum ten-year lease in the Pearl District in 2010, taking the place of another restaurant that had closed. Chef Sarah Schafer, who was chef de cuisine at the Washington and Rosenthal‚Äìowned Anchor & Hope, was persuaded to move from San Francisco to become the new restaurant's executive chef. With its name changed to Irving Street Kitchen, the new restaurant opened on May 6, 2010, with an opening-day menu consisting of items like smoked short rib, fried chicken with collard greens, and charcuterie. The next month, Irving Street Kitchen unveiled a barbecue lunch menu. They also began serving brunch on August 7, 2010, offering items like a smoked shrimp club sandwich, sourdough flapjacks, and scrambled eggs with lobster and mascarpone. Irving Street Kitchen began serving lunch on June 6, 2016. Game hen from Irving Street Kitchen. In 2019, Irving Street Kitchen announced that it would be revamping its decor and menu to give off a more casual atmosphere. Schafer, by now the co-owner as well as the head chef, stated that the change \\"[was] a response to our diners\\" who, according to Schafer, did not currently care for the \\"pomp and circumstance\\" that the original concept provided. In addition, the restaurant would also host pop-up restaurants by guest chefs, as well as give yoga classes to its staff and other restaurant employees after work to promote a healthy work‚Äì‚Å†life balance. General manager and co-owner Anna Caporael elaborated on this, saying that they \\"[wanted] to have a space that [was] stimulating for our next generation\\". According to a 2020 report by the Portland Monthly, Schafer and Caporael owned 30% of Irving Street Kitchen. It was also mentioned by The Oregonian that Moana Restaurant Group owned the establishment. In June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Schafer and Caporael announced that Irving Street Kitchen would permanently close, citing the pandemic along with landlord disputes as the reason for the restaurant's closure. Earlier that year in March, it was reported that when the restaurant halted operations due to Portland's measures to combat COVID-19, Caporael gave equipment and perishable items to Stone Soup, a local nonprofit providing food service training for those at risk of homelessness. The restaurant also temporarily opened on March 17, 2020 to give away food to those in the service industry who needed it. Reception In 2010, The Oregonian David Sarasohn gave the restaurant a \\"B\\" rating, stating that \\"the kitchen's Southern skills make Irving Street a considerable gain for the neighborhood and the local dining scene.\\" Chris Stamm of the Willamette Week liked the poultry dishes on his 2015 trip, citing the \\"perfectly cooked, falling-off-the-bone\\" confit duck leg, \\"smooth, livery\\" duck sausage, and fried chicken as standout items. Karen Brooks of the Portland Monthly enjoyed Irving Street Kitchen's brunch, calling it \\"one of the best brunches in the city, led by attention to details, a high level of craft, and some memorable flavors.\\" See also * COVID-19 pandemic in Portland, Oregon References External links Irving Street Kitchen details in the Portland Monthly *Irving Street Kitchen details on Travel + Leisure 2010 establishments in Oregon 2020 disestablishments in Oregon Defunct restaurants in Portland, Oregon Pearl District, Portland, Oregon Restaurants disestablished in 2020 Restaurants established in 2010 ","title":"Irving Street Kitchen"},{"id":"51489571","text":"The 2016‚Äì17 IUPUI Jaguars men's basketball team represented Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis during the 2016‚Äì17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Burnham at a drafting table Dorothy Kate Burnham (November 6, 1911 ‚Äì October 24, 2004) was a Canadian textile scholar, author and museum curator. Early career She began her career at the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto, Canada, in 1929, at the age of 17, as a second assistant draftsman. In 1939, she became the museum's first curator of textiles, taking responsibility for a growing international collection begun by founding director Charles T. Currelly. She took courses at the Cranbrook Academy of Art and the Banff School of Fine Arts and studied museum practices in Europe. In 1944 she married Harold B. Burnham and over the next sixty years, either independently or in conjunction with Harold, carried out research on Canadian and global textiles and costume. Inspired by a donation of a Canadian coverlet, the couple in 1947 launched a research project on the history of Canadian handweaving, traveling to interview weavers and study looms and collections, first throughout Ontario, and then in all the eastern provinces, leading to the 1971 exhibition and publication Keep Me Warm One Night: Early Handweaving in Eastern Canada (1972). From 1949 to 1973 Burnham took leave from the museum to raise her family and to operate, with Harold, a private weaving enterprise called Burnham&Burnham;, located in the Niagara Peninsula. Later career In 1973, she rejoined ROM to curate a string of exhibitions and publications, notably Cut My Cote (1973), which revealed basic garment constructions shared the world over, and the influence of weave on costume cut. Following her retirement from the ROM in 1977, she published Warp & Weft: A Dictionary of Textile Terms (1981) a work which advanced the standardization of terminology in the emerging discipline of textile studies. She undertook further research and exhibition projects with the National Gallery of Canada, the Provincial Museum of Alberta and the Canadian Museum of Civilization. These include studies of the painted caribou-skin coats of the Montagnais- Naskapi tribe of the Quebec-Labrador area and of the textile traditions of the Doukhobors. Legacy In 1984, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada and in 1990 she was named an Honorary Doctor of Laws, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario. Burnham‚Äôs work at the ROM and throughout her career has made her a seminal figure in Canadian and international textile studies, informing generations of subsequent scholarship.

Biography  Du Toit was born in the former Transvaal Province on a farm, where she had one elder brother, though both children were virtually orphaned by the age of three as their mother died in 1912 in childbirth, and their father served with the South African Forces in France during World War I where he was severely shell shocked. Both children attended St. Ursula's Convent Boarding School in Krugersdorp from 1915 to 1919. After the war the family went to stay with relatives who were farming in Rhodesia. When Du Toit was eighteen, she moved to Johannesburg where she began to work with trade unionist Johanna Cornelius. She was assigned a textile factory where she would organize workers for striking. The owner of the factory was Jewish and appreciated Du Toit's \\"anti-racist and anti-Nazi sensibilities.\\" During a textile worker's strike in the late 1920s, she was arrested and was fined \\"one pound or 10 days labour.\\" This incident made her more committed to striving for workers' rights. In 1936 she joined the South African Communist Party and went to the USSR to study, returning in December 1937.Andries Nel, The Life and Struggle of Bettie du Toit At that time, she married Jan van Rooyen and adopted the name Bettie du Toit. The marriage was short-lived as they were divorced in 1939. In 1938, Du Toit went to Cape Town and the town of Huguenot to organize three textile factories that employed white women and black men working together. During her time there, she attempted to form a union committee which had an equal number of white and black representatives. Later, when she danced with the black union chairperson at a fundraising dance, many of the white union members resigned. She managed to rebuild the union, but it was never as strong after that. In 1942 she married for the second time to Guy Routh who was also a Communist and who flew seaplanes during World War II. This marriage also ended in divorce in 1946. He went on to become an important figure in the formation of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement. In 1947 she married for the third time to Yusuf Cachalia in Port Elizabeth, one of the last places to allow \\"mixed marriages\\". Du Toit met Nadine Gordimer in the 1950s and they became friends. Du Toit also worked as an activist. She protested the Asiatic Land Tenure Act and took part in the Defiance Campaign. She joined on December 6, 1952. On the day of the protest in Johannesburg, December 8, Du Toit ensured that she and others were arrested (which was part of the goal). She was later fined 50 pounds or fifty days with compulsory labour and she was jailed with Freda Troup for 25 days. Her participation in that campaign caused her in 1952 to be banned for life from participating in trade unions under the Suppression of Communism Act. Du Toit began writing a book about the trade unions and worker's rights in a book called Ukubamba Amadolo (Go Slow). She founded an organization to promote the welfare of people in Soweto called Kupugani. Kupugani provided food to people in the black ghettoes, and it was against the law for her to be there. She would travel to and from Soweto, wearing a disguise at night until she was discovered by the police. In 1960, she was arrested. In fear that she would be jailed long-term, she went into exile in 1963 London. She was smuggled out of the country by friends of Gordimer who were Indian. Du Toit got stranded in Dar es Salaam, where Gordimer visited her and helped her get to Ghana. In Ghana, Du Toit worked with trade unions and for the Ghana Broadcasting Association, and enjoyed being able to swim in the ocean. She contracted Stevens-Johnson syndrome from polluted water and was not treated properly in the hospital. She went blind and Gordimer appealed to have her brought to London where she lived with the help of Freda Levson, who had helped hide Nelson Mandela. She taught herself Braille and then taught Braille to others. Eventually, in 1993 she was able to move back to South Africa where she was reunited with her brother, whom she had not seen for 50 years. She died in Johannesburg in 2002. Du Toit was reported by her friend, Gordimer, to have \\"met death without any religious beliefs of another life, as she had taken on, and lived to the full deprivation and danger, the life of a revolutionary for freedom.\\" In 2012, Du Toit was posthumously awarded the Order of Luthuli in Silver under the name Elizabeth Sophia Honman.  Personal life  Du Toit openly defied the Immorality Act, living with her forbidden husband, who was black. They maintained the fiction that he was her gardener.

Events Violence broke out in at least nine of Libreville's neighborhoods when official results were announced on 31 August 2016, showing a narrow victory for President Bongo, and protesters set the national parliament building ablaze. Rioting and violence continued on 1 September. Ping's headquarters were surrounded and bombed by a presidential guard helicopter, killing two people. Gunfire and explosions were heard in the neighborhood of Nkembo. According to a local resident, government forces attacked an opposition radio and television station. Some looting was reported. Around 1,100 people were said to have been arrested as security forces fought to suppress the riots. Pacome Moubelet Boubeya, the Minister of the Interior, condemned the violence and accused Ping and other opposition leaders of orchestrating it; he also claimed that the rioters were armed with AK-47s and grenades, although the opposition denied that.

Early life  Arthur Wilfred Ashby was born on 19 August 1886, the eldest son of Joseph Ashby (1859‚Äì1919), a farmer and surveyor, and his wife Hannah (n√©e Ashby; born c. 1861).Thomas, Edgar (2007), \\"Ashby, Arthur Wilfred (1886‚Äì1953)\\", rev., Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (online edition) The son of an unmarried servant, the elder Ashby spent his life working in agriculture in Tysoe, Warwickshire, eventually farming over 200 acres of land. His colourful life involved active participation in politics; he campaigned for the reform of land-ownership and smallholdings. As one biographer said \\"His life was remarkable, encapsulating in many aspects the ideal of the self-improving working man, and embracing most of the institutions‚Äîthe nonconformist chapel, trades unionism, and working-class Liberalism‚Äîthat so clearly represented social and political betterment in the later years of the nineteenth century\\".Howkins, Alun (2016), \\"Ashby, Joseph (1859‚Äì1919)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (online edition)  Career  = Education = Like his father, the younger Ashby attended the National School in Tysoe, but left just before he turned 12 to work with his father to help him farm, survey the land and carry out his religious and political activities. In 1909 he enrolled at Ruskin College, Oxford, as a Charles Buxton Scholar and, after two years of study, left with a diploma in economics and political science. In 1912, he received a scholarship from the Board of Agriculture and attended the Institute for Research in Agricultural Economics at Oxford and then the University of Wisconsin as an honorary fellow in political science. = Academic = In 1917, Ashby completed his first book, Allotments and Smallholdings in Oxfordshire; the fruit of two years' work at the Institute in Oxford, it became a standard work in his field. Shortly afterwards, he worked for the Board of Agriculture until 1919, taking a major role in the establishment of the Agricultural Wages Board. After returning to the Institute once more, he was appointed head of the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 1924; professorship there followed five years later, which meant he became he first chair of agricultural economics in Great Britain. He returned to the Institute in Oxford, this time as its director, in 1946, serving until 1952; in the year of his appointment, he was also made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and the following year became a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford. Ashby's work made him a pioneer of agricultural economics and he championed the establishment of the Agricultural Economics Society in 1926; he went on to be its president from 1934 to 1935 and from 1952 to 1953. He was a Member of Council of Agriculture for England (1920‚Äì46; chairman, 1939‚Äì40) and of Wales (1927‚Äì46; chairman 1944‚Äì45).\\"Ashby, Arthur Wilfred\\", Who Was Who (online edition), Oxford University Press, 2014.

He contributed to a wide range of academic journals and gave important speeches at conferences relating to his field. He was an expert on milk-production and was instrumental in the establishment of the Milk Marketing Board, while also serving from 1924 on the Agricultural Wages Board. He was a passionate educator and a capable departmental leader.Phillips, Llywelyn (2001), \\"Ashby, Arthur Wilfred (1886‚Äì1953)\\", Dictionary of Welsh Biography. Retrieved 1 September 2016.  Personal life, local service and death  In 1922, Ashby married Rhoda, daughter of John Dean and Rhoda Bland, and they had one son. Never quite at ease with other academics, Ashby has been described as a \\"shy, reserved person with a touch of the suspicious caution of the typical countryman\\", but also as a helpful tutor with a good sense of humour. He inherited a radicalism from his father which manifested itself in support for the Labour Party, while his local commitments included service as a Justice of the Peace successively in Cardiganshire (1940‚Äì46) and Oxfordshire (1946‚Äì53).

It was originally going to be a replacement series for Square Pegs, but dismal ratings for the pilot episode caused the network to not go further. The pilot was written by Bob Comfort and Rick Kellard and directed by Bill Bixby. The show was intended to be an hour-long comedy-drama set in the 1960s, with the characters progressing from high school to college. Comfort complained, \\"When we first took it to NBC it was in an hour format. But Brandon Tartikoff [NBC's 34-year-old \\"Child of TV\\" President of Entertainment] didn't understand it. So then we took it took it to CBS and they immediately saw it as a half-hour comedy; maybe do it with three cameras on tape before a live audience. Then they said how about making it in contemporary times because CBS, at the time, was committed to doing Diner, which was set in the '60s.\\" Plot Set in suburban Indiana, the show centers around three friends ‚Äì smooth Pete Falcone (Robert Romanus), nerdy Neil Hefernan (Leif Green) and aspiring musician Dewey \\"The Phantom\\" Hooper (Chris Nash) ‚Äì starting their freshman year at Ulysses S. Grant High School. Pete has made an agreement with his caring, but strict father Gene (Alex Rocco) that he will stay out of trouble this year, since Gene promised Pete he could have his own car, as Neil is the only one currently with a driver's license. On the way to school, they pick up two girls, brash Robin DuPree (Krista Errickson) and goody-goody Patti Eubanks (Hallie Todd), who takes a liking to Pete immediately. Patti enlists Robin's help to woo Pete at the upcoming freshman dance, as long as Patti pays her money. Dewey also has his hands full when the sadistic, hard-nosed vice principal Franklin T. Otto (William G. Schilling) reminds him that he will keep a close eye on Dewey for the entire semester as he is known for pranks and cutting classes. A subplot consists of hulking resident bully Garth Stimlovich (Tony Longo) returning to town to settle a score with Pete when he ratted him out in a school incident, causing him to get expelled and placed in military school. He also knows Pete has been taunting his younger brother and his friend. One night, as Gene is fixing the kitchen sink, he mistakenly receives a threatening phone call from Garth, complete with racial slurs, saying a fight is going to happen. Knowing Pete is a part of this, Gene firmly tells him that even though he does not condone fighting of any kind, and that they have a deal going on, Pete has his permission to teach Garth a lesson, even if the fight might get Pete suspended from school. He also tells Pete that he will not tell his mother about it, either. The night of the dance, the three hatch up a plan to get even with Garth's brother and his crony. Neil stands guard outside in the parking lot while Pete and Dewey act casual in the gymnasium. The two bullies corner Neil and he attempts to spray them with a hose, but it runs out of water. Pete and Dewey come to his rescue and push both bullies into a car trunk and lock it, but Garth shows up, in military attire, and gives Pete a black eye, but Patti, hiding on the flatbed of a pickup truck, knocks Garth out cold with a trash can lid. To pay her back, Patti tells Pete to look her up in the phone book.

Rio Madeira Sustainable Development Reserve The Rio Madeira Sustainable Development Reserve is divided between the municipalities of Manicor√© (15.22%), Borba (46.1%) and Novo Aripuan√£ (38.68%) in the state of Amazonas. It has an area of . The reserve is contiguous to other conservation units that make up the Matupiri-Igap√≥ A√ßu mosaic. The reserve extends along the left (northwest) bank of the Madeira River. The town of Novo Aripuan√£ on the right bank is opposite the centre of the reserve. It adjoins the Matupiri State Park to the north of the western section, and the Matupiri Sustainable Development Reserve to the north of the eastern section. It is bounded to the east by the Arary Indigenous Territory. Environment The reserve is drained by the \\"white water\\" Madeira River, which flows from Porto Velho in the state of Rond√¥nia to the Amazon River below Manaus in Amazonas. The vegetation of the Madeira-Purus interfluvial, in which the reserve is located, is of great importance for conserving biodiversity, with endemic species that are potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic threats, particularly birds. The varied environments include campinas and campinaranas, which conserve a variety of species of flora and fauna and are refuges of the Pleistocene. Vegetation in the reserve includes dense lowland rainforest with emergent canopy and alluvial forests along the streams. Economy The reserve has 25 communities with about 480 families. The traditional populations are descendants of rubber tappers. The main economic activity is agriculture, with bananas being the main commercial crop, and Brazil nuts also gathered for sale. Other possible economic resources include timber, copaiba and cumara. The area has high potential for ecotourism. History The Rio Madeira Sustainable Development Reserve was created by Amazonas state decree 26.009 of 3 July 2006 with the objectives of preserving nature, ensuring continuation and improvement of methods of extracting natural resources and quality of life of the traditional populations, and preserving and enhancing knowledge and techniques for managing the environment developed by the traditional population and others. On 12 November 2007 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA ‚Äì National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve as meeting the needs of 388 small families, who would qualify for PRONAF support. This was revised to 550 families on 11 December 2007. The deliberative council was created on 1 February 2010. The Bolsa Floresta program was extended to the residents in 2010, providing some income to families and community associations and other support in exchange for environmental stewardship. The management plan was approved on 22 July 2014. As of 2016 the reserve was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program.

Burnfoot River Shingle is a calaminarian grassland on the River South Tyne where the local flora is influenced by high levels of naturally occurring heavy metals. Wydon Nabb is an escarpment displaying the Haltwhistle Dyke, a magmatic intrusion of igneous dolerite set amidst sedimentary sandstone and shale. Location and natural features The Burnfoot River Shingle and Wydon Nabb site is situated in the south-west of Northumberland, some south-west of the town of Haltwhistle. The Burnfoot River Shingle element of the site is a length of River South Tyne riverbanks, running in a north-easterly direction at about above sea level and extending to . Wydon Nabb is an escarpment situated at the north-east of the site, falling from to the river-level. Geology Wydon Nabb constitutes the site‚Äôs feature of geological interest; it is a south-facing oxbow escarpment above the river, one part of which is a -wide intrusion of magmatic dolerite rock through the surrounding horizontal sedimentary rock strata of sandstone and shale. The intruded rock, termed a dyke and named for the nearby town - Haltwhistle Dyke - is part of the much larger Whin Sill, an igneous rock formed from magma upwellings into and through fractures caused by crustal extension of local tectonic plates some 295 million years ago. Vegetation Burnfoot River Shingle, grasslands on both banks of the River South Tyne, constitutes the site‚Äôs feature of biological interest. The river drains a watershed including parts of the Northern Pennine Orefield, as a result of which high levels of heavy metal have built up in the river shingle, and on this thrive a community of metal- tolerant plants. Common across the site are alpine penny-cress (Thlaspi alpestre), spring sandwort (Minuartia verna), common scurvy-grass (Cochlearia officinalis agg.), mountain pansy (Viola lutea) and thrift (Armeria maritima). A number of distinct habitats are found at the site. Parts of the shingle with more moderate toxicity support short grasses such as sheep‚Äôs fescue (Festuca ovina), or taller grasses including false oat-grass (Arrhena therum elatius) and common knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Amongst these are found a number of species associated with limestone including kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), purging flax (Linum catharticum) and small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria). Downy birch (Betula pubescens), common sallow (Salix caprea) and alder (Alnus glutinosa) grow on sections of the site, beneath which can be found the narrow-lipped helleborine (Epipactis leptochila), characteristic of metalliferous sites in Northumberland and uncommon elsewhere. Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), hazel (Corylus avellana) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea) form woodlands at the outer margins of the site. Water crowfoot (Ranunculus aquatilis) and water plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica) are found in pools left by river channel migration, and surrounding fens support horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile), bottle sedge (Carex rostrata) and meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria). The condition of Burnfoot River Shingle was judged to be unfavourable-declining in 2011. Invasive species are encroaching on the site in part because of lower levels of heavy metals in the contemporary river, (most mining having ceased in the watershed) and due to insufficient intervention. Wydon Nabb was judged favourable in the same year.

During her long career she led labor campaigns for telephone operators, garment and jewelry workers, boiler makers, library staffers, teachers, sales clerks, and laundry workers. She was active in many labor and civil rights organizations, including the Boston Women's Trade Union League, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. She was a vocal opponent of antisemitism, racism, and fascism, a lifelong supporter of women's rights and workers' education, and an advocate for the elderly. Early life Rose Finkelstein was born on September 10, 1890, in Kiev, Russia, the second of eight children of Henry Finkelstein, a Jewish distillery worker, and Fanny Schafferman. Her family moved to the United States when she was a year old.Some sources list her birthplace as Kiev and her birth year as 1889. According to her Boston Globe obituary, she was born in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood and was 89 when she died in 1980. The family settled initially in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, before moving to the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. She attended Jamaica Plain High School until her senior year, when she quit school to work as a telephone operator for New England Telephone. As a child in East Cambridge, Rose was bullied by Irish-American youths who yelled \\"Christ Killer\\" and threw bricks at her as she walked to school. During one such attack she suffered a serious head wound, and one of her assailants was subsequently sent to prison. The family was forced to move to a less hostile neighborhood. The experience had a lasting influence on Rose, making her more sensitive to oppression and informing her anti-fascist, Zionist beliefs. Career She became a charter member of the Boston Telephone Operators Union in 1912. In 1919 she helped lead 8,000 telephone operators in a six-day strike that paralyzed telephone service throughout New England. Despite a lack of support from TOU's male union leaders, the predominately female operators won major concessions: their wages were increased, split shifts were abolished, and their right to organize was guaranteed. In 1921 she attended the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, an alternative educational program for women workers. While at Bryn Mawr she joined other students in demanding that the college meet trade union standards in its treatment of black employees. In 1928 and 1935, she attended summer school at the Brookwood Labor College in New York, where she studied organizing techniques and \\"how to raise the trade-union child\\". The latter course inspired her to found a Boston chapter of the Child Study Association. She also took classes at the Boston Trade Union College. During the 1920s she was active in the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL), the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and groups defending the Italian-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti. As a member of the WTUL she campaigned for women's rights, including the right to continue working after marriage. In 1924, she moderated a forum in which Jennie Loitman Barron, then a young lawyer, spoke about the need to include women in juries. (Women were not allowed to serve on Massachusetts juries until 1949.) In the 1930s and 40s, Norwood was one of the most prominent female organizers in the American labor movement. In 1937, after leading several successful campaigns for telegraphers, she led a series of contentious strikes for the Boston Laundry Workers Union. At Lewandos Laundry in Watertown, Massachusetts, while fighting for equal pay for black workers, she was arrested in a picket line clash. Later she worked for the Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, the International Jewelry Workers Union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Retail Clerks International Union, and the Service Employees International Union, leading campaigns throughout New England and Pennsylvania while facing police dogs, tear gas, and harsh winter weather. She organized the clerks at the Jordan Marsh department store in Boston, and workers at the Boston Public Library. Her involvement with librarians inspired her to start the Books for Workers program, in which public libraries provided books to union halls and factories. Norwood became an officer in the Boston WTUL during the 1930s, and served as its president from 1941 to 1950. In 1942, because of her experience with interracial labor organizing, she was appointed to the advisory board of the Boston chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. During World War II she campaigned for taxpayer-funded daycare for children of mothers employed in the war industry. As a member of the Boston Herald Rumor Clinic, headed by Gordon Allport, she worked to combat antisemitism, racism, and Nazi propaganda. As a member of the Massachusetts Citizens Committee for Racial Understanding, she organized opposition to a surge in local antisemitic violence. After the war, she urged organized labor to protect women's jobs; campaigned for equal pay for Boston's women teachers; lobbied for legislation to allow refugees, including Holocaust survivors, to immigrate to the United States; served as a member of the Massachusetts Committee for the Marshall Plan; and became involved in the Labor Zionist cause. In the 1970s she advocated for the rights of senior citizens, and was appointed by Mayor Kevin White to Boston's Advisory Commission on Elderly Affairs. Personal life On December 25, 1921, Finkelstein married a fellow Russian Jewish immigrant named Hyman Norwood, who owned a tire and battery store in Roxbury. The couple had two children, Bernard and Barbara. At their mother's insistence, the children were raised in Mattapan, which was then a Jewish neighborhood. Rose Norwood died of a heart attack on September 25, 1980, at her home in the Hotel Vendome in Boston's Back Bay and was buried in Sharon Memorial Park in Sharon, Massachusetts. Her grandson, Stephen H. Norwood, is a noted historian and author. Rose Norwood is remembered in connection with the WTUL on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

It takes its name after the naval ship commanded by Niels Juel in the Battle of K√∏ge Bay in 1677. The main wing from 1801-1811 is listed. History An earlier building at the site was known as Ravnsborg after Mads Tavn, K√∏ge's mayor, who owned it from 1630. During the Dano-Swedish War in 1658‚Äì1660, the building was demolished upon orders from the Swedish officer Erik Lyster. In 1720, a new building was constructed on the site which in that day was still surrounded by fields. The town only continued as far north as Accisevej/Allegade. Town musician S. J.F.Krebs, who owned it from 1742, ran an illegit inn in the building. In 1759, after a renovation of the buildings, he obtained a royal license to operate a mail and coaching inn. It was given the name Norske L√∏ve after one of the naval ships that participated in the Battle of K√∏ge Bay on 1 July 1767. It was commanded by Niels Juel, had a crew of 568 men and was equipped with 86 canons. After S. J.F.Krebs' death, his widow married a chemist named Carl Hansen. Norske L√∏ve developed into a popular excursion destination for people in K√∏ge. The large garden, with fishing pond, music pavilion and an estrade for dancing, was often frequented by travelling fun fairs in the summer time. When the equestrian statue of Frederik VII was unveiled in 1862, Norske L√∏ve hosted a dinner with 800 guests. The current main wing was built some time between 1801 and 1811. From 1860, Norske L√∏ve was home to K√∏ge's first telegraph station. In 1885, Norske L√∏ve, which was still owned by the same family, lost its license. In 1924, Hotel Postg√•rden opened in part of the building. Hans Christian Andersen inscription In a letter to Signe L√¶ss√∏e from July 1836, Hans Christian Andersen mentions how he once, when staying in Norske L√∏ve, looked for an inscription in a window pane which he had heard about reading \\"Oh God Oh God in K√∏ge\\".

It was commanded by a Royal Australian Army Service Corps officer and staffed by Australian, New Zealand, United Kingdom personnel and Locally Employed Civilians (LECs). This organisation operated for only a short period. Australia changed Government in 1972 and the incoming Labor Government decided to withdraw Australia‚Äôs commitment to the region. This took effect in 1974 and was followed later by the withdrawal of the British forces. It was then decided that New Zealand should form its own Transport Company, designated the New Zealand Transport Company. This was the start of a commitment which was to last until December 1989. Formation The NZ Transport Squadron came into being to support the New Zealand Force South East Asia which was to remain in Singapore post the British and Australian withdrawal.

Since 1334, the seat of the ancient Archbishopric of Ohrid was under Serbian rule, and by the autumn of 1345 Serbian forces completed the conquest of northern Greece, including the city of Serres, capital of eastern Macedonia and the seat of an important Metropolitanate. To mark the occasion, Stefan Du≈°an was proclaimed Emperor () on December 25, 1345 (Christmas) in Serres. Since it was customary for an emperor to be crowned by a patriarch, newly-proclaimed Tsar Stefan Du≈°an decided to convoke a joint state and church assembly (sabor) that was held on April 16, 1346 (Easter) in the Serbian capital city of Skopje. This assembly was attended by Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, Archbishop Nicholas I of Ohrid, Patriarch Simeon of Bulgaria and many other Hierarchs and Church dignitaries, including monastic leaders of Mount Athos. The assembly proclaimed the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the rank of Patriarchate. The Archbishop of Peƒá was titled Serbian Patriarch, and his seat at the Monastery of Peƒá became the Patriarchal residence. On the same occasion, the newly-proclaimed Serbian Patriarch Joanikije solemnly crowned Stefan Du≈°an as Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Greeks. The proclamation of the Patriarchate resulted in raising main bishoprics to the rank of honorary metropolitanates, starting with the bishopric of the city of Skopje that was raised to Metropolitanate of Skopje. The Patriarchate took over supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Mount Athos and many Greek eparchies in Aegean Macedonia that were until then under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The same process continued after the Serbian conquests of Thessaly, Epirus, Aetolia and Acarnania in 1347 and 1348. In the same time, the Ohrid Archbishopric remained autocephalous, recognizing the honorary primacy of the new Serbian Patriarchate. Since proclamation of the Patriarchate was performed without consent of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, various canonical and political questions were raised. Supported by the Byzantine government, Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople issued an act of condemnation and excommunication of Tsar Stefan Du≈°an and Serbian Patriarch Joanikije in 1350. That act created a rift between the Byzantine and Serbian churches, but not on dogmatic grounds, since the dispute was limited to the questions of ecclesiastical order and jurisdiction. Patriarch Joanikije died in 1354, and his successor Patriarch Sava IV (1354-1375) faced new challenges in 1371, when Turks defeated the Serbian army in the Battle of Marica and started their expansion into Serbian lands. Since they were facing the common enemy, the Serbian and Byzantine governments and church leaders reached an agreement in 1375. The act of excommunication was revoked and the Serbian Church was recognized as a Patriarchate, under the condition of returning all eparchies in contested southern regions to the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. After the new and decisive defeat by the Turks in the famous Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Serbia became a tributary state to the Ottoman Empire, and the Serbian Patriarchate was also affected by general social decline, since Ottoman Turks continued their expansion and raids into Serbian lands, devastating many monasteries and churches. The city of Skopje was taken by Turks in 1392, and all other southern regions were taken in 1395. That led to the gradual retreat of the jurisdiction of the Serbian Patriarchate in the south and expansion of the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Ohrid. Finally, in 1455, the city of Peƒá fell into Turkish hands. Soon after that, the Serbian capital of Smederevo also fell in 1459, marking the end of the main Serbian medieval state. Patriarch Arsenije II died in 1463, and the Serbian Patriarchate sank into the period of great decline. =Medieval eparchies of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá= Vacancy Period (1463-1557) In the second half of the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire gradually conquered all Serbian lands, starting with the Serbian Despotate in 1459, followed by the conquest of the Bosnian Kingdom in 1463, Herzegovina in 1482, and finally Montenegro in 1499. All eparchies of the Serbian Patriarchate were devastated during Turkish raids, and many monasteries and churches were plundered and destroyed. Because of that, the period was remembered as \\"The Great Desolation\\" (ser. –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–µ –∑–∞–ø—É—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ). Although some Christian Serbs converted to Islam after the Turkish conquest, the vast majority continued their adherence to the Serbian Orthodox Church. On the other hand, the structure of the Serbian Patriarchate was deeply disrupted. After the death of Patriarch Arsenije II in 1463, the question of succession was opened. Since sources are silent, historians concluded that the period of vacancy was prolonged, resulting in de facto abolition of the Patriarchal office. In the same time, the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Ohrid continued to expand towards northern Serbian eparchies until it finally took over the entire territory of the Serbian Patriarchate. That situation was not acceptable for Serbian church leaders who wanted to restore previous Church order. Shortly after the Turkish conquest of Belgrade in 1521 and victory in the Battle of Mohacs in 1526, Serbian Metropolitan Pavle of Smederevo made a series of attempts to restore the Serbian Patriarchate, and for a short time managed to seize the throne of Peƒá, proclaiming himself to be the new Archbishop of Peƒá and Serbian Patriarch. By 1541, his movement was crushed by joint forces of the Archbishopric of Ohrid and the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In spite of that, Serbian Church leaders continued to hope for a new chance to renew their old Patriarchate. Early Modern Period (1557-1766) Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá was finally restored in 1557 thanks to the mediation of some highly influential dignitaries in Turkish Court. During the second half of the reign of Turkish Sultan Suleiman I (1520-1566), one of the most notable Ottoman statesmen was pasha Mehmed Sokoloviƒá, who served as one of the Viziers since 1555 and later became Grand Vizier (1565-1579). By birth, he was an Orthodox Serb, taken from his family as a boy under the rule of Dev≈üirme and converted into Islam. In spite of that, he later restored ties with his family, and in 1557 his cousin Makarije, one of the Serbian Orthodox bishops, was elected the new Serbian Patriarch of Peƒá. The full restoration of the old Patriarchate was of great importance for the Orthodox Serbs because it enabled them to reorganize and improve their spiritual and cultural life under the Ottoman rule. Territorial jurisdiction of the Patriarchate was expanded towards northern and western regions, with more than 40 eparchies, from Skopje to the south, to the Eparchy of Buda to the north. Among new eparchies in western and northern regions were: the Eparchy of Po≈æega in lower Slavonia, the Eparchy of Baƒçka between Danube and Tisza, and the eparchies of Vr≈°ac and Temesv√°r in the region of Banat. One of the largest eparchies by territory was the Eparchy of Dabar-Bosnia, which had jurisdiction from the region of upper Drina throughout central and western Bosnia, up to the borders of Venetian Dalmatia and the Habsburg Military Frontier. The newly restored Serbian Patriarchate also included some eparchies in western Bulgaria. The basic title of its primate was Archbishop of Peƒá and Serbian Patriarch, although extended patriarchal titles sometimes included not only Serbs, but also Bulgarians, and various regions in western parts of the Southeastern Europe. For Christian Serbs in Ottoman Empire, the renewed Serbian Patriarchate was a religious and national symbol that substituted for their long-lost state. Therefore, the Patriarchate could not stand aside of political events and some of its leaders participated in local uprisings against Turkish rule. In the time of Serbian Patriarch Jovan Kantul (1592-1614), the Ottoman Turks took the remains of first Serbian Archbishop Saint Sava from the monastery of Mile≈°eva to the Vraƒçar hill in Belgrade, where they were burned by Sinan Pasha on a stake to intimidate the Serbs in the time of the Banat Uprising (1594). The present-day Temple of Saint Sava in Belgrade was later built on the place where his remains were burned. According to British historian Frederick Anscombe, who praised works of Noel Malcolm on the history of Kosovo, there was \\"no ethnic monopoly on appointment to supposedly national church positions\\" in the Patriarchate of Peƒá and the Archbishopric of Ohrid. He also added that those ecclesiastical institutions \\"had no ethnic nature at that time, neither formally, nor in practice\\" and therefore placed \\"Serbian\\" and \\"Bulgarian\\" names in brackets. The turning point in the history of the Serbian Patriarchate was marked by the events of the Austro-Turkish war (1683‚Äì1699). During the war years, relations between Muslims and Christians in European provinces of the Turkish Empire were greatly radicalized. As a result of Turkish oppression, destruction of monasteries and violence against the non-Muslim civilian population, Serbian Christians and their church leaders headed by Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III sided with Austrians in 1689 and again in 1737 under Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV. In the following punitive campaigns, Turkish armies conducted many atrocities against local Christian populations in Serbian regions, resulting in Great Migrations of the Serbs. Since northern parts of the Patriarchate came under the rule of the Habsburg Monarchy during the war (1683-1699), Serbian eparchies in those regions were reorganized into the autonomous Metropolitanate of Kru≈°edol (1708) that remained under supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Serbian Patriarchate. In 1713, the seat of the Metropolitanate was moved to Sremski Karlovci. Consequent Serbian uprisings against the Turks and involvement of Serbian Patriarchs in anti- Ottoman activities, led to the political compromise of the Patriarchate in the eyes of the Turkish political elite. Instead of Serbian bishops, Turkish authorities favored politically more reliable Greek bishops who were promoted to Serbian eparchies and even to the Patriarchal throne in Peƒá. In the same time, after 1752 a series of internal conflicts arose among leading figures in the Serbian Patriarchate, resulting in constant fights between Serbian and Greek pretenders to the Patriarchal throne. Finally, the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá collapsed in 1766, when it was abolished by the Turkish Sultan Mustafa III (1757-1774). The entire territory of the Serbian Patriarchate under Ottoman rule was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The throne of Peƒá was suppressed and eleven remaining Serbian eparchies were transferred to the throne of Constantinople. Those eparchies were: See also *Serbian Orthodox Church *List of heads of Serbian Orthodox Church Notes { style=\\"margin-left:13px; line- height:150%; font-size:100%;\\" align=\\"right\\" valign=\\"top\\"a.  } References Sources           External links *Official website of the Serbian Orthodox Church Patriarchate of Peƒá History of the Serbian Orthodox Church ","title":"Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá"},{"id":"51490304","text":"Goerz Minicord III Minicord front view Goerz minicordn deluxe leather case Goerz minicord with deluxe leather case Goerz Minicord cassettes Goerz Minicord is a 16 mm twin lens reflex 16 mm subminiature camera made by C.P.Goerz of Austria in 1951.William White, Sumbiniature Photography, Focal Press 1990, p74 It is one of the three top-quality subminiature cameras (the others are Minox and made in Italy Gami 16).Paul Wahl, Subminature Technique, Chilton Co,1960, p35 Minicord length 114 mm, 71 mm deep, and 71 mm wide.

He was known professionally as A. E. Hayward for his comics work although he used his full name for his fine arts work. He is best known for his seminal 1918-1941 strip Somebody's Stenog (\\"stenog\\" standing for \\"stenographer\\"). This strip, featuring flapper-era secretary Cam O'Flage, was one of the first daily strips focusing on an independent woman. It was the first enduring daily strip to have an \\"office girl\\" as the protagonist and to be concerned with a group of female office workers. Early career and painting Hayward was born as Alfred Mark Hayward on February 14, 1884, in Camden, New Jersey, to English immigrants. His father and grandfather were painters, and he became an accomplished watercolorist himself, exhibiting his impressionist landscapes (usually of mountains, and some quite abstract) to critical praise at New York's Fifteen Gallery, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (where he studied), and many cities of the United States and beyond. In addition to his painting, Hayward worked as a newspaper writer of humorous human interest fare, wrote poetry, and lectured at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, but found his greatest fame when he turned to cartooning. He created the strip Some Day, Maybe for the New York World in 1912 and Great Ceasar's Ghost, later named Great Ceasar's Goat and later still Pinheads (1913‚Äì1915) also for the World. He created Colonel Corn (1915‚Äì1918) for the New York Herald and the single-panel Padded Cell (also 1915‚Äì1918) for the Public Ledger Syndicate. In Padded Cell he ran a suite of cartoons called Somebody's Stenographer for six weeks in 1916. This served as a prototype for his most successful work. Somebody's Stenog Somebody's Stenog first ran on December 16, 1918, preceding (and perhaps in part inspiring) the similarly-themed strips Winnie Winkle (1920) and Tillie the Toiler (1921). The Sunday strip debuted on April 30, 1922. The strip was distributed out of Philadelphia by the Ledger Syndicate. Characters included Cam O'Flage's friend Mary Doodle, her boss Sam Smithers, and her rival Kitty Scratch. Hayward retired from the strip in 1933 and died in 1939; the strip was continued by artists including Ray Thompson and Sam Nichols. The last Somebody's Stenog strip was published May 10, 1941. The strip was published outside America. In French Canada it ran in La Presse under the title LouLou and in Sweden it ran in Hemmets Journal as Grosshandlare Petterkvist och hans sekreterare (\\"Merchant Peter Kvist and His Secretary\\"). Somebody's Stenog was successful enough that Al Capp, shopping Li'l Abner in the mid 1930s, was pressured to instead draw a strip similar to Hayward's. Personal life and death Hayward married Stella Kelly on August 28, 1907. They had a daughter, Joyce. Hayward died in New York City on July 25, 1939.

It was designed by Alfred Mowbray Hutton and built from 1911 to 1912 by Robinson & Freeman. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003.  History  The present Barcaldine Shire Hall was built in 1911-1912 and is the second official building used by the Council for the administration of the Shire of Barcaldine. The building was designed by Alfred Mowbray Hutton. Major alterations were made to the building in 1952. The town of Barcaldine developed almost \\"overnight\\" in 1886 with the extension of the Central Western Railway west from Rockhampton. The railway was a vital factor in opening up the central western regions of Queensland to European settlement in the mid to late nineteenth century. The original site of the terminus was to have been the pastoral station of Barcaldine Downs, established by pastoralist Donald Cameron in 1865. It was eventually decided to locate the terminus at Lagoon Creek however. Barcaldine rapidly grew to prosperity, on a permanent scale, unlike most of the other railway townships on the central line. The town was surveyed by Victor Desgrand, the Government Surveyor, in July 1885 and sales of town lots were held in December. The town was laid out on a rectangular grid, parallel to and south of the railway line. A town reserve of was gazetted in June 1886, when further allotments of land were sold. The railway was not officially opened until December 1886, by which time the town had already \\"assumed formidable proportions\\". After a year of official European settlement, the population of Barcaldine in 1887 was estimated at 1500. The Divisional Boards Act of 1879 brought local government into the outback of Queensland. The Kargoolnah Divisional Board was created in this year and centred on Blackall, an early pastoral township. The geographical area serviced by this board covered a great area in western Queensland, taking in the future towns of Tambo, Barcaldine and Jericho. With Barcaldine developed rapidly from 1886, the residents formed the Barcaldine Progress Association, and began agitating for their own municipal representation. In 1893, a Divisional Board at Barcaldine was instituted, which was to evolve into the Barcaldine Shire Council. At first the Barcaldine Divisional Board met in a building in Oak Street, but the building was burnt down during a fire in the town in 1896. It was decided to construct a hall to the design of the Rockhampton architects, Eaton & Bates. Completed in May 1898, the hall was located on the south-eastern corner of Ash and Beech Streets in the Divisional Board Reserve. This building served the community more than adequately into the twentieth century, witnessing the administrative changeover from Divisional Board to Shire Council in 1903. By the early years of the new century however, it was apparent that the hall was too small for the administration of the shire. In 1911 the council commissioned the architect A. M. Hutton to design a new building for the Shire Hall and Offices. Hutton died shortly after completing the plans. The design was then taken over by Frederick Boddington, Hutton's partner. Robinson & Freeman, builders of Rockhampton, submitted the only tender, which was accepted with a price of . The new hall was planned to be completed to coincide with the silver anniversary celebrations of the settling of the town. Delays were encountered in its construction before the hall was completed in February 1912. It appears it was constructed adjacent to the former hall, which was then purchased by the Aramac Shire Council for and removed. Barcaldine Shire Hall newly built, 1912 The 1912 building was constructed largely as designed by Hutton although there were a number of slight modifications. It was built of timber with a corrugated iron roof, with the official rooms of the council at the front section, and the hall behind. The offices were designed as a separate but linked pavilion, with a single skin wall. They were surrounded by verandahs at the front and sides, with a wide passage separating them from the hall. The main entrance to the building was identified by a large triangular pediment which capped an archway. The clock tower rose above the entrance in the centre of the building. Pediments were installed each end of the front verandah. Between these and the entrance, the verandah was divided into four bays with a lattice valance forming complimentary arches across the face of the building. Side verandahs to the office section were also treated similarly. The council rooms opened out to the verandah on all sides with the French doors and casement windows. The Council Chambers and Shire Chairman's office were to the right of the central passage, and the offices for the Shire Clerk and a solicitor to the left. The floors of these rooms were generally covered in linoleum, with green or grey walls and white pressed metal ceilings. At the end of the central passage through two sets of double doors was located the hall. The hall featured a flat floor with a raised stage, and an upstairs gallery. The hall opened sideways onto the subsidiary verandah spaces. On the eastern verandah was a supper room, on the western were smoking rooms and toilets. The hall was of large proportions, measuring , and was well ventilated with vents and louvres, and fanlights which acted as a clerestory providing light and ventilation over the adjoining verandah roofs. The gallery of the hall was reached through a staircase in the front section of the building. A passageway provided access from this gallery, out to the clock tower and along a viewing deck which sat above the verandahs of the office section. The Shire Hall was officially opened on Friday 8 March 1912 by Shire Chairman James Cronin. It was a joint celebration with the town's silver jubilee and was attended by an estimated 1,000 people. The Barcaldine Shire Hall was the principal public building in the town. The hall was used by most citizens of the shire in some capacity, for fundraising activities, as a public venue, to attend meetings, for the associated operations in the efforts of two world wars, for the health and welfare of the people, and many other events. In 1952 the Shire Hall underwent some rather major alterations, documented by the Brisbane architect Charles William Thomas Fulton with Aubrey Horswill Job & James Musgrave Collin architects in association. The major change involved the demolition and removal of the clock tower and the promenade deck. The decorative front and side verandah to the office was also removed, and replaced with a new verandah design. The east verandah of the hall, which contained the supper room, was also partially rebuilt. New toilet facilities were added within the west verandah, which was also enclosed. The hall was also repainted, a new ticket office was installed, and memorial gates at the entrance were later built. These gates were planned by the Barcaldine War Memorial Committee and included plaques bearing the names of those from the district who enlisted and those who died in World War II. In 1993 a conservation study of the Barcaldine Shire Hall was prepared for the Barcaldine Shire Council. In the mid-1990s, two new freestanding buildings were erected, one either side of the 1911-12 building at the front, and linked to it, providing new shire council offices and a new shire library.  Description  Shire Hall, circa 1920 The Barcaldine Shire Hall and Offices are built of timber with a corrugated iron roof, with the official rooms of the council at the front section, with the hall behind. The building lies in the administration precinct of Barcaldine, fronting Ash Street and bounded by Beech Street. It shares the town block with other government buildings, including the Court House; while the Post Office sits on the opposite (south- western) corner of Ash and Beech Streets. The hall and offices structure is well set back from both streets, and is centrally located within the government reserve. The site contains significant plantings which also line the street boundaries. Memorial gates dedicated to those who enlisted and those who died are located in front of the main entrance to the building. In fabric, scale, and design, the building has not changed since the completion of the 1950s renovations. Much original joinery in the building survives basically intact, as does much of the original interior linings, including the stamped steel ceilings and beaded tongue and groove wall boards.  Heritage listing  The Barcaldine Shire Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building is significant as it demonstrates the growth and development of Barcaldine. It is significant as the major public building in the town for more than 80 years. The building is on the original Divisional Board Reserve, surveyed when the town was set out in 1885, and helps to define the town's original surveying. The Barcaldine Shire Hall and Offices is also important in demonstrating the modernising influence of the 1950s, with its extensive additions and alterations of that time. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is significant as a rare surviving example of a late nineteenth/early twentieth century timber shire hall, many of which were constructed but few of which survive. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The site is significant for its architecture, particularly its interesting plan form. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a strong association with the Barcaldine Community, being the centre for local government and the central social venue of the town, and having been used by most of the citizens of the shire in some capacity. The site has further significance to the Barcaldine community as it contains memorial gates erected by the Barcaldine War Memorial Committee following World War II.

She served as a prominent role model for women. She dedicated her career to serving those in need. She is most known for her roles of leadership in her service work, highlighted by her role as a chairman of the Commission on the Status of Women in 1961. She used her career as an attorney and journalist to help solve issues with poverty and women's rights.  Early childhood and education  Margaret A. Hickey was born on March 14, 1902 in Kansas City, Missouri to Elizabeth Wynne and Charles Hickey. Charles Hickey, who lived in Paris, France at the time, served on the Foreign Service as a U.S. diplomat in Europe and the Ottoman Empire until World War I. The family bounced around several outposts in the Ottoman Empire prior to the war. Her family was forced to move back to the United States in 1914 due to World War I. After making that transition, Elizabeth Wynne worked in favor of the suffrage movement in Kansas City, which she included her children on as well. As a young girl, she made banners for suffragist parades. This exposure helped Margaret Hickey develop her interest in fighting for women's rights. When Margaret was in her late teens she actively worked for the peace movement in regards to World War I. In 1921, Hickey dropped out of college so she could work for the Kansas City Star as a reporter. She began working with influential business women involved in the National Federation of Business and Professional Women. Hickey, 20 years old at the time, was fascinated by these prominent women and this led her to enroll in the University of Kansas City Law School. There she pledged Kappa Beta Phi, a legal sorority for women. She received LLB degree from Kansas City University Law School (later University of Missouri) in 1928.  Career  After graduating from law school, Margaret Hickey declined offers from multiple firms in Kansas City and St. Louis to open up her own office as a private practice. In her early career, Hickey was heavily Influenced by fellow lawyers Florence Allen and Lena Madesin Phillips. She worked primarily in poverty law, due to the depression of the 1920s. In 1933, Hickey established the Margaret Hickey School for Secretaries at Delmar and Skinker in St. Louis. Her school became a long term success, which led Hickey to not change her last name when marrying Joseph Strubinger in 1935. She later gave up her private practice work as a lawyer to focus on the school. Hickey served on the advisory committee to the Social Security Board in the 1930s. She then went on to served on an advisory committee for the Office of Emergency Planning, which led to her role on the War Manpower Commission. In 1942, she was suggested to Women's Advisory Committee of War Manpower Commission by Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. She served as a chairman to this committee from 1942 to 1945. As chairman, she presided over a group of 14 women who advised on the most effective use of women workers in the war effort. Hickey was frustrated by the lack of progress they made in regards to the amount of potential competent women had. This committee dealt with issues involved in recruiting women into the wartime economy. In this position, she was given the opportunity to travel the country and speaking to audiences. She argued that women needed more college seats in order to progress. Her message to women was that in order for there to be meaningful change, women must leave the kitchen and enter the factory. This position made Margaret Hickey a prominent national figure and role model for women. In August 1944 she declared that the nation's \\"magnificent war production\\" was due to the \\"hidden army\\" of women working for victory. In that same year she was elected president of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women, a group she sought after as a young woman. She served in this position for two years, and remained honorary president thereafter. In 1946, Hickey traveled to Paris to work on the human rights section of the UN charter with Eleanor Roosevelt. The document the committee drafted is now known as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Also in that year, Hickey went back to journalism and joined the Ladies Home Journal, a successful wartime magazine stationed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She received the Ben Franklin Award for Distinguished Public Service Journalism in 1953 from the city of Philadelphia. In 1961, Hickey was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as a chairman of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. She primarily worked on federal employment policies. In 1968, she sold her school for secretaries, which is now named Hickey College. Over the course of her career, she was appointed by six presidents to lead national committees, some of which are as follows: Voluntary Foreign Aid Committee, White House Conference on Education, National Commission on the Status of Women, Committee on Federal Employment Policies and Practices, Citizens Council on the Status of Women. Margaret Hickey had built up a bit of national prominence throughout her career. Because of that she was in high demand as a public speaker. She spent her final 25 years working as a public speaker. = Red Cross = Margaret Hickey volunteered to work for the Red Cross and YWCA throughout her life. In 1931, she began running her own class to help train unemployed women with credentials or experience. The federal government took over this program in 1933. Hickey began volunteering for the Red Cross in 1946. The following year, she served on the Board of Governors for six years, and then again for six years in 1955. In 1960 she served as the Deputy to Chairman E. Roland Harriman for the next thirteen years. For the Red Cross she also served as the Vice Chairman of the humanitarian law commission of the international congress. In 1966 she served as a chairman to the Organizing Committee for International Conference on Social Welfare. Margaret Hickey became a leader to those suffering from oppression and poverty. She was in positions and on committees to be a catalyst of real change for those who she represented.

The American military at that time was still racially segregated. Rodgers, a high-school graduate, applied to the program. He was selected but could not train immediately. The Tuskegee Institute did not have the funds to support all the selectees so Rodgers was in the Army anti-aircraft artillery for about three months as a Radar Operator guiding the 90 millimeter shells to hit aerial targets. Initially he went for basic training, not to Tuskegee, but to Keesler Field, in Mississippi, along with 200 other aviation Cadet- Selectees.Scott Thompson,\\"The Tuskegee Airmen of Laurens County\\", Laurens County Historical Society, November 10, 2014, retrieved September 4, 2016 Captain Marion Rodgers His primary flight training in PT-17 Stearman Biplanes took place at Moton Field in Tuskegee, Alabama.

Pilot trainees then returned to Tuskegee Army Air Field and closer military scrutiny, while they flew the Vultee BT-13A (450 horse power) for 80 hours in what was called basic training. The PT-17 had more power and was easy to land, but the new training challenged the pilots in other ways, such as acrobatics and navigation. The advanced phase for the next two months included the AT-6 (550 horse-power), which was much harder to land but easy to ground loop.

It was built in 1888 in the Italianate style and features architectural details rendered in tin. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for being a prominent example of the brick homes constructed by Wabasha's late-19th-century merchant class, one made particularly distinctive by its tinwork. Description The Schmidt House is a wood frame building with a brick veneer. The main section rises one and a half stories and is topped with a jerkinhead roof. A one-story kitchen wing at the rear gives the house an L-shaped footprint. A one-story sunroom was added to the side of the house in the early 20th century. The house stands out for its tin window hoods, shaped as winged pediments resting on protruding bosses. Most distinctive is an ascending trio of small windows, which mark an internal staircase. History Julius Schmidt was born in 1857 to a German American family in Milwaukee, and came to Wabasha as a child in 1864. He apprenticed to a tinmaker, but went into business in 1882 as a partner in a hardware store. However, when he had this house built in 1888, he embraced the use of tinwork as a middle-class version of the architectural details that a wealthy homeowner would have rendered in stone. The tinwork was likely produced by Schmidt's foreman Herman Dieterle, who had built a regional reputation as a master craftsman and metalworker since 1862. Schmidt became the sole owner of the hardware business in 1893 and ultimately served as president of the Minnesota Hardware Retailers Association. After his death, his widow Clara Schmidt donated to the city the open lot east of the house, which became known as Schmidt Park. The Schmidt House is the last Italianate example of some 20 brick residences surviving from the 19th century in Wabasha. All were built by the first two generations of the city's merchant class, forming a distinctive architectural stock that contrasts with the elaborate wood-frame Victorian architecture that characterized most other communities in Minnesota. As time went on the choice of building material appears to have been a matter of local taste rather than accessibility, as Wabasha was not a major brick manufacturer compared to Lake City and Red Wing upriver.

Biography Hasan-Ali was a slave of either Armenian or Georgian origin, and had already gained a prominent position in the late Safavid era, when he entered the royal service during the reign of king Sultan Husayn (r. 1696‚Äì1722), and became an important official by the 1720s. In 1726, by Tahmasp II's order, Hasan-Ali was sent to report on the activities on the then emerging Nader Qoli Beg (later known as Nader Shah). Persuaded by Hasan-Ali, Nader became an associate to Tahmasp II as he joined him, and on the latters' behalf, he was appointed deputy governor of Abivard. As the Encyclopedia Iranica states; \\"This encounter marked the beginning of a long and close connection between ·∏§asan-  øAli and NƒÅder\\". In the early 1730s, Hasan-Ali lived in Isfahan, and functioned as a messenger between Nader and Tahmasp II, and he oversaw the fiscal affairs of Iran from there as well. He later played a role in the removal of Tahmasp II from the throne and the subsequent crowning of then still infant Abbas III in 1732. By 1736, when Nader was already the de facto ruler of Iran for many years, Hasan-Ali was known as one of his most trusted and principal advisors. Nader suggested to his closest intimates, after a great hunting party on the Moghan plains, that he should be proclaimed the new king (shah) in place of the young Abbas III. The small group of close intimates, Nader's friends, included Tahmasp Khan Jalayer as well as Hasan- Ali. Following Nader's suggestion, the group did not \\"demur\\", and Hasan-Ali remained silent. When Nader asked him why he remained silent, Hasan-Ali replied that the best thing for Nader to do would be assembling all leading men of the state, in order to receive their agreement in \\"a signed and sealed document of consent\\". Nader approved with the proposal, and the writers of the chancellery, which included the court historian Mirza Mehdi Khan Astarabadi, were instructed with sending out orders to the military, clergy and nobility of the nation to summon at the plains. From the crowning ceremony on the Moghan at which Hasan-Ali was present, up to Nader's death in 1747, he was a permanent resident at the king's camp. After Nader's assassination in 1747, Hasan-Ali managed to escape. This caused Nader's long-time Jesuit doctor Bazin to form suspicious assumptions regarding Hasan-Ali, and he therefore believed that the latter had a certain involvement in the assassination plot. Following the death of Nader and the succession to the throne by his nephew Ali-Qoli, Hasan-Ali briefly served as an important advisor to the latter. Following this short occupation, he returned to Isfahan. There, it is said that Hasan-Ali allegedly \\"counseled Karim Khan Zand to enthrone Abu Torab Mirza as king Ismail III in 1750\\". The descendants of Hasan-Ali adopted the title of mo øayyer al-mamƒÅlek as their family name. Decades later, one of Hasan-Ali's namesake descendants, would serve as a government official of the then ruling Qajar dynasty of Iran, during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1797‚Äì1834). He married one of the latters daughters as well, around 1834.

Beginning his career as a slam poet in San Francisco, Roth gained attention for his unusual blend of religious themes with frank sexual material, and appeared in the 2002 live Broadway production of Def Poetry Jam. As a writer, he has written three young adult novels, two children's books, and two memoirs, and has written for The Forward, Tablet, and Jewcy. He also co-founded the Jewish culture website Hevria, with Elad Nehorai, and the Jewish educational website G-dcast (later BimBam), with Sarah Lefton. In 2014, Roth and his wife, restaurateur Itta Werdiger-Roth, were included in The Jewish Week's \\"36 Under 36\\", a list of influential young Jews under age 36. Early life Roth was born on June 30, 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were both teachers. While he was raised in a Conservative Jewish family and participated in an Orthodox youth group, he was largely nonreligious for several years and was an anarchist in high school. Roth's parents bought him a computer when he was 13, which he used to write for several websites as well as his first novel, Colony One, which he later called \\"horrible\\". When he was 14, a female friend of his was sexually assaulted, which he said \\"kind of sent me into a tailspin...I was like, this is male sexuality and male sexuality is violent and I don‚Äôt want a part of that...One of the only safe spaces that I found was hanging around queer people.\\" He graduated from George Washington University, where he studied anthropology and religion. During this time, Roth developed a deeper interest in his Judaism and joined a daily minyan on campus. He also began growing peyos while studying abroad at Charles University in Prague. Career =Spoken word= After graduation, Roth remained in Washington, D.C. and worked as a sociological trend consultant, but was unsatisfied with his social life there and \\"desperately wanted to get out.\\" After a friend gave him a copy of the novel Valencia by author Michelle Tea, Roth found himself drawn to the book's portrayal of San Francisco's subculture and moved to the city, where he lived from 2001 to 2004. While living in San Francisco, Roth met up with Tea and other former Sister Spit members and began performing poetry and spoken word at local clubs. During the 2000s, he performed at the Intersection for the Arts with Tea, Dave Eggers, and Beth Lisick; at a Chabad menorah lighting event at Justin Herman Plaza with Shlomo Katz and Carlos Santana; the Daniland Talent Showcase alongside the Suicide Kings, Sini Anderson, Carlos Mena, and Aya de Leon; and a 2002 Broadway production of Def Poetry Jam. He also performed at Solomon Schechter High School of New York and at the Hillel House of Pennsylvania State University. In 2009, Roth and rapper Mista Cookie Jar formed the nerdcore hip hop duo Chibi Vision. They debuted with The Chanukah Mini-EP and announced a full-length album, The Elements of Style, shortly afterward. They were featured on a 2011 segment of The Henry Rollins Show on KCRW. =Literary career= In 2005, Cleis Press published Roth's first full-length book, the memoir Yom Kippur a Go-Go, named for a zine he had written three years prior. Jason Diamond of Flavorwire later described it as \\"striking a balance between [Roth's] old-time religious beliefs and modern-world interests, from poetry to hip hop.\\". That same year, Roth published his first young adult novel, Never Mind the Goldbergs, through Scholastic's PUSH imprint. While the book was written in six months, it took two years to edit, and Roth encountered difficulty finding a publisher for the book due to its unusual tone and subject matter. Upon release, the book garnered mixed reception but received the American Library Association Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults award and the New York Public Library Best Book for the Teen Age award. A release party was held on January 20, 2005 at La Tazza 108 in Philadelphia with musical performances by Juez and E.D. Sedgwick. Roth subsequently published two more young adult novels, Candy in Action in 2007 and Losers in 2008, on PUSH and Soft Skull Press, respectively. Roth published his first children's book with My First Kafka: Runaways, Rodents, and Giant Bugs, released on June 15, 2013. Illustrated by Rohan Daniel Eason, the book reinterprets the works of Franz Kafka for a child audience, specifically \\"The Metamorphosis\\", \\"Josephine the Singer, or The Mouse Folk\\", and \\"Excursion into the Mountains\\" from Contemplation. Roth conceived of the project while reading \\"Jackals and Arabs\\" to his two young daughters. He and Eason re-teamed the following year for The Gobblings, about a lonely boy on a space station who must defeat a race of metal-eating monsters. =Other projects= Amplify Prior to 2015, Roth was a lead writer and developer of educational software games for the company Amplify. He was one of several of Amplify employees laid off after its sale by parent company News Corp in 2015. BimBam (G-dcast) In 2012, Roth and producer Sarah Lefton co-founded the website and production company G-dcast (later renamed BimBam), having been developing the idea since meeting in San Francisco in 2005. The website produced short animated video content based on the weekly parsha, stories from the Talmud, and other parts of the Torah, with the goal of educating children and others learning about Judaism. In addition to his role as co-founder, Roth scripted and edited several videos for the site. BimBam was shut down in April 2019 due to lack of funding. Hevria Roth and activist/blogger Elad Nehorai co-founded the website Hevria in mid-2014. The site's name is a portmanteau of the Hebrew words \\"chevra\\" (group or society) and \\"briah\\" (creation). Primarily a group blog centered around essays about Judaism and art, the site also features \\"Hevria Sessions\\", studio performances by Jewish musicians, and, since March 2017, an official podcast entitled HevriaCast, where Nehorai interviews various Jewish artists, writers, and musicians. Roth and Nehorai conceived of the project during an email conversation in 2012 with writer Chaya Kurtz, who had gotten attention for an xoJane article entitled \\"What Women's Media Needs to Know About Chassidic Women\\"; the three theorized that a full website could give even more insight into Hasidic Jews, and Nehorai subsequently recruited other blogging contacts to participate. 1/20 Roth wrote the screenplay for the independent film 1/20 (2010), a coming-of-age story centered around punk rock and the 2008 presidential election and featuring music from the punk bands Against Me! and Can Can, among others. Roth, who had not done any prior screenwriting, was hired by the producers on the strength of Never Mind the Goldbergs and partially based the story on his time living in Washington, D.C.. Directed by Gerardo del Castillo Ramirez, the movie was primarily shot in Queens, Manhattan, and Monsey, and finished filming in November 2009. Upon release, the movie was screened at the Detroit Windsor International Film Festival, the Mexico International Film Festival (where it won the Bronze Palm), the Guadalajara International Film Festival, and Indie Fest, where it won an Award of Merit. Personal life Roth is married to Itta Werdiger, a Lubavitcher from Melbourne, Australia who founded the kosher restaurants The Hester and Mason & Mug. The couple met in 2004 in Brooklyn while Roth was trying to write for television. At the advice of Werdiger's father-in-law, they moved to Nachlaot, Jerusalem so that Roth could study for a year at Yeshivat Simchat Shlomo. He also met with the Biala Rebbe multiple times during this period, and later became a follower. The couple have three daughters. Roth enrolled in an MFA program in Creative Writing at Brooklyn College, from which he graduated in 2014. He suffers from an anxiety disorder and has written about his struggles with it.

History  Thomas Mitchell first explored the area in 1846 and following subsequent exploration in 1858 by Augustus Charles Gregory and by William Landsborough and Nathaniel Buchanan in 1860, the first pastoral run in the area was taken up in 1861 to be soon followed by others. By 1864 most pastoral land in the area had been taken up. Tambo was the first township on the Barcoo River, a town reserve being gazetted on 27 June 1863 as \\"Carrangarra\\". In 1864 a license was granted for the Barcoo Club Hotel and the settlement quickly developed. In 1866 a Clerk of Petty Sessions was appointed to Carrangarra and a mail service was established at the Royal Carrangarra Hotel with the publican as postmaster. In 1868 the town was surveyed and renamed Tambo. The first land sales were held in the following year although 50 people and 34 buildings were already present in the budding township. In 1873 the post office moved to the store, the storekeeper becoming the postmaster. The Overland Telegraph network was begun in Australia in 1854. The first line in Queensland was that established between Ipswich in Brisbane in 1861. Lines continued to be constructed and by 1870 most major coastal towns and some western centres were linked to the system. An Electric Telegraph Station was opened at Tambo on 16 June 1874, following the construction of a telegraph line between Tambo and Springsure. This line ran northeast to Springsure through Clermont to Nebo, where it joined the main northern line extending from Brisbane to Dalby through Hawkwood and Camboon to Rockhampton and then to Bowen, Townsville and Cardwell to Normanton on the Gulf of Carpentaria. The line made Tambo a key part of the Australian communications network link. In 1875 a further telegraph line was opened to Charleville and in 1877 to Blackall. In 1876 the first purpose-built post office was constructed at the northeast corner of Star and Arthur Streets, Tambo. It was a timber building with a shingle roof and was constructed to a typical plan for a rural post office of the period, being domestic in form with public offices at the front and accommodation for the postmaster and his family at the rear with a detached kitchen at the back. In 1879 the Post and Telegraph Offices were amalgamated in Queensland and in 1883 a second telegraph line opened between Tambo and Blackall. Tambo was now a major relay station and the old post and telegraph office was inadequate. In 1885 a new building was constructed adjacent to the existing post and telegraph office and the older building became used wholly for accommodation, a common method of extending inadequate premises at the time. The new building consisted of a single room and in 1886 a battery room was added to the rear. Extension of the lines was continued and by 1887 there were five telegraph operators at Tambo. Although some additions were made in 1895 to increase office and mail box space, when the buildings were assessed at Federation, when control passed into the hands of the new Australian Government, they were considered inadequate. A new post office was planned in 1903 on the site of the existing buildings. Tambo ceased to be a repeating station in 1916 when Charleville became the main station. When the new post office was completed in 1904 the old buildings were sold for removal. The 1876 building was sold to Mr and Mrs Sullivan who were licensees of the nearby Telegraph Hotel and moved across the road to land next to the hotel. Mrs Sullivan had been the widow of Denis Mulhern who had held the licensee of the hotel since its establishment in 1877. Mrs Sullivan had seven adult children from this marriage and the property passed to Denis George Mulhern in 1921. The building remained in use as a dwelling until the mid 1990s. The 1885 building was sold for removal in 1905 to builder Frank Murch and was also moved across the road to an adjacent block also owned by the Sullivans. A photograph taken in 1906 shows that a verandah had then been added to the front and a room to the rear, presumably to make it more suitable for residential purposes. In 1922 William and Hannah Volk became licensees of Telegraph Hotel and purchased the 1885 post office building as a residence. Mrs Volk died in 1970 and her home was offered to Tambo Shire Council as a museum. In 1973 the Tambo Shire Council took on responsibility for the building, offering it in 1992 as a venue for the Tambo Teddies scheme. This well-known and highly successful cottage industry project made and sold teddy bears made from local wool. The Teddies project has now moved into the former Tambo Shire Hall on the site of the Telegraph Hotel and the former post office buildings now comprise the Tambo Telecommunications Museum.  Description  Tambo Electric Telegraph Office, built 1885 The two former post office buildings are timber structures situated adjacent to the Shire Council chambers and across the street from the 1904 Post Office. The former 1876 post office is a timber building set on low stumps and constructed of vertical boards and battens with verandahs to all sides. It has a pyramidal roof clad in corrugated iron and the separate verandah awning is also of corrugated iron supported on timber posts. It has a four-room core with a central front door and casement windows. To the rear of the building there is a detached kitchen of similar construction comprising a single room with an awning along the front. Alongside this building is the 1880s post office extension. This is also a timber building set on low stumps and is T shaped in plan, comprising two rooms facing the street and two rooms, set one behind the other, to the rear. The roof is clad with corrugated iron and is hipped over the front section and gabled at the rear. A verandah with a separate roof runs around the three sides of the front section and is supported on timber posts. The building has a central front door and sash windows.  Heritage listing  Post office built 1904 (not heritage-listed) The former Tambo Post Office was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Post Office at Tambo, comprising an 1876 office and separate 1885 extension, illustrates an important phase in the development of a communications network in Queensland. In the late 19th century Tambo was the main communication point in western Queensland north of Charleville and the rapid development of this network is evidenced by the fact that several post and telegraph buildings at Tambo were constructed in sequence as each building became inadequate. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although some alterations have occurred, the buildings, particularly the 1876 post office, are rare surviving examples of post office buildings of their era. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. They are good examples of architectural types developed at this time by the Public Works Department, which was instrumental in improving the quality of building design and construction in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former post office buildings have aesthetic significance as part of a series of public buildings along the main street of Tambo, including the courthouse, an early 20th century post office and the shire hall, which define the visual character of the township.

It is found in the intestinal systems of humans and animals. Research is being conducted to better understand the relationship Bacteroides dorei has on the human intestinal system and the autoimmune disease, Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).  Biology and ecology B. dorei is an gram negative, rod- shaped bacteria that contributes to normal intestinal functionality. It was isolated and differentiated from Bacteroides vulgatus by using 16S rRNA sequencing and phenotypic tests. B. dorei is a non-spore-forming, non-motile, and anaerobic bacterium with a DNA G+C content of 43%. Growth occurs optimally at 37 ¬∞C with individual cell size between 1.6-4.2 Œºm by 0.8-1.2 Œºm. In addition, colonies streaked on Eggerth Gagnon (EG) agar with 5% horse blood plate and incubated over 48 hours in 100% CO2 gas at 37 ¬∞C, resulted in colony size of 2.0 mm and individual colony morphology of circular, white, raised, and convexed.  Taxonomy   Metabolism  B. dorei has been tested for numerous different metabolic test looking at different sugars. Growth of cells was seen via production of acid occurred on the following sugars: glucose, sucrose, xylose, rhamnose, lactose, maltose, arabinose, mannose and raffinose while no growth and no acid production occurred on the following sugars: cellobiose, salicin, trehalose, mannitol, glycerol, melezitose and sorbitol.  Medical significance  Previous research has shown that individuals who are genetically predisposition to various autoimmune diseases have significant differences in bacteria composition than non-genetically predisposition individuals. This difference in bacteria composition in the gut system is increasingly believed to be highly important in understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type1 Diabetes. In 2014, researchers looked at the early development of bacterial composition in high genetic risk children looking at early onset of Type 1 Diabetes. They took stool samples of 76 children looking at the early development of microbial communities from 4‚Äì6 months of age until 2.2 year old. Out of the 76 infants, 29 seroconverted to T1D autoimmune related cases, of which of 22 later on developed T1D (cases). The other 47 infants didn't seroconvert or develop T1D (control). Metagenomic sequencing results showed significantly higher composition of B. dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus in the cases versus the control group prior to seroconversion. In addition, data showed that B. dorei peaked at 7.6 months, almost 8 months prior to first inslet autoantibody in cases. This significant compositional change suggests that the increase in amount of B. dorei is a potential indicator of the development of T1D. Additional research looked at epigenetics of B. dorei and were able to demonstrate that 1 individual had B. dorei with GATC (gene) methylation while another individual had B. dorei lacking GATC methylation. Scientist took stool samples of two babies and sequenced the genomes of B. dorei in samples 105 and 439. Sample B. dorei 105 had 49,007 total methylation in the genome with 14,322 methylation sites and in sample B. dorei 439, there was 38,203 total methylations with 24,770 methylation sites. The key result is that sample 105 includes a key gene called DamMT (DNA methyltransferase) while sample 439 lacked this gene. In addition, out of 20,554 GATC sites in sample B. dorei 105, there was only had 3 sites that weren't methylated whereas sample B. dorei 439 had 18,908 GATC sites and none of the GATC sites were methylated. Dam methylation and methylation of GATC could be significant factors for microbial colonization and functionality in the gut system and affects numerous gene expressions of transport processes such as nutrient transportation, antibiotic effluxes actions to antibiotic resistance, and movement of energy. The results suggests that Dam and GATC methylation of B. dorei 105 could have highly significant varied gene expression from B. dorei 439 that lacks GATC methylation and could affect functionality of B. dorei in the gut microbiome. Previous research has shown that Dam methylation mutants have increased susceptibility to higher antibiotic concentrations and lower minimum. This suggests that Dam methylation process plays a significant role in up-regulation of antibiotic effluxes, resulting in increased antibiotic resistance. Also, GATC methylation demonstrates important microbial functions such as DNA repair, replication, and LPS composition. Methylation of GATC motif by DamMT in pathogenic bacteria, for example, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia pestis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis has been shown to increase virulence and expression of genes towards multiple operations such as, mismatch repair and DNA replication enables pathogenic bacteria to combat against antibiotics. These results show why future research to create antibiotics that prevent the creation of DamMT in pathogenetic bacteria is needed.

The region noted for its sparse forests of Betula ermanii (\\"Stone birch\\"), and also for extensive tall-herb meadows. It is in the Palearctic realm, and mostly in the boreal forests/taiga biome with a Humid continental climate, cool summer climate. It covers .  Location and description  The coasts of Kamchatka are relatively flat, and cooled by the cold current of the Sea of Okhotsk to the west, and the East Kamchatka Current that flows down the east coast on the Bering Sea side. The ecoregion includes the Kuril Islands down to Urap Island, the northernmost 800 km of islands that stretch down from the peninsula. The Commander Islands lie in the 175 km to the east of the middle of the peninsula in the Bering Sea. The area is volcanic, and the soils are Andosol (black volcanic).  Climate  The climate of this region is mostly Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc and Dsc)). This climate is characterized by mild or cool summers (only 1‚Äì3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). with oceanic influences. There is no permafrost south of 57 degrees north, reflecting the relatively warmer conditions. Precipitation can reach 2,500 mm per year, compared with lows of 450 mm in the central valley where the mountains provide some protection.  Flora  The main floral communities are dwarf forest (primarily Alder and Siberian Dwarf Pine), sparse forests (Ermine birch and Japanese white birch), tundra (moss, lichen and shrub), and some meadows. Common tall herbs include Senecio cannabifolius (Aleutian ragwort), and Filipendula camtschatica.  Fauna  The area is known for its very high population of brown bears (over 15,000 individuals), and for the extensive networks of streams supporting salmon spawning grounds. Scientists have recorded 104 species of fish in the Kronotsky area alone, and species inventory has only begun. The most common near-shore marine fish gobies, greenlings, pollock, herring, and flounder. Migratory salmon include pink, chum and coho. The rugged coasts are important for colonies of migratory seabirds, particularly those wintering in the area. Important mammals include bear, reindeer, sable (now protected in Kronotsky), wolves, and sea otters. Coastal Kamchatka is a breeding ground for the critically endangered Spoon- billed sandpiper.

Since 2017, the band has consisted of Mikey Carnevale (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Richard Dotson (bass guitar, backing vocals), Marc Finn (drums) and Jordan Clark (lead guitar, backing vocals).  History  The Frights were formed in 2012 by lead vocalist/guitarist Mikey Carnevale, bassist Richard Dotson, and drummer Adam Lomnitzer as a simple time-killer project following the trio's graduation from high school. Their musical style mixed elements of surf, classic punk, and doo-wop, resulting in \\"tunes that managed to be catchy, aggressive, and playfully ridiculous all at once.\\" The band separated shortly after formation, with all three members attending college, but rejoined in December 2012 to play a one-off show during Christmas break. The intent was to disband once again after this show, but the band were approached by an audience member who offered to sign the band to local label Postmark Records. The Frights released their first single ‚ÄúHippie Lips‚Äù on the Postmark Records YouTube channel in February 2013. In March 2013, The Frights' debut EP Dead Beach was released by Postmark. This was followed by their second EP, Fur Sure, in May 2013, and their self-titled debut studio album on October 31, 2013. In 2014, the band would continue to perform live as well as record and release new material starting with the single \\"Tongues / Puppy Knuckles\\" in April. On July 22, The Frights and Death Lens would release a split EP titled DeathFrights. This marked the band's final release with Postmark, as well as the exit of drummer Adam Lomnitzer who would be replaced by Marc Finn shortly after. Due to other commitments, Finn would not be able to gig consistently with the group until spring 2015, during which Ryan Ward would sit in on drums. Afterwards, Ward would continue to play with the band as a guitarist until his departure in September, 2016. The Frights signed with independent label Dangerbird Records in 2015. Subsequently, they released their sophomore studio album You Are Going to Hate This, produced by FIDLAR frontman Zac Carper, on February 12, 2016. In February, 2018 The Frights returned to the studio with Carper to record their third studio album Hypochondriac, this marked a shift in lyrical themes and musical style, with frontman Mikey Carnevale writing more personal songs about past relationships and mental health. The album was the band's first for Epitaph Records, as well as their first album to feature lead guitarist Jordan Clark. Hypochondriac was released August 24, 2018 to mixed critical reception. On April 12, 2019, The Frights released Live at The Observatory, a live album which captured their September 8, 2018 show at The Observatory in Santa Ana, California. Following the release of Live at The Observatory, on April 21, 2019, Mikey Carnevale and Richard Dotson began the recording of Carnevale's planned solo album, these sessions concluded on April 28 and The Frights would return to the road shortly after. Carnevale's songs would be performed live at a series of shows in San Diego and Los Angeles to positive response from the other band members, it was then decided that the album would be released as The Frights' next studio album.

Jeff Burstin joined in 1990. In Camilleri's own words, their desire was to \\"blow out the serious days' work with people who shared the same interest in music and who simply wanted to play it\\". The band is a side project of The Black Sorrows as all members were part of The Black Sorrows at the time of formation. The Revelators' sound was a return to early Black Sorrows sound: playing largely R&B-oriented; cover songs. The band released three studio albums and a live DVD between 1991 and 2002. A greatest hits was released in 2012. The band received two ARIA Award nominations; both for ARIA Award for Best Blues and Roots Album, in 2001 and 2003. History Band members Camilleri, Black and Creighton were part of The Black Sorrows, an Australian blues and roots band that had released five studio albums in the 1980s. The band's first three albums were independently released and featured mostly cover versions of Rhythm and blues songs. The group signed to CBS Records in 1987 and released two more albums, including Hold On to Me released in 1988, which featured all original material. The album peaked at number 3 on the ARIA charts and was nominated for five ARIA Awards at the ARIA Music Awards of 1989. Camilleri, Black and Creighton created \\"The Delta Revelators\\", a side project of the Black Sorrows in the late 1980s to play gigs and relax after more serious studio work. The response from Melbourne audiences led them to regular sessions at ID's (now The Continental) and the Botanical Hotel which in turn led to fans requesting an album. The band recorded Amazing stories ‚Äì a collection of roots based covers in 1991. The album was re- released in March 1993 as a 2-CD pack with The Black Sorrows' Better Times and it peaked at number 14 on the ARIA Charts. A near ten-year hiatus then ensued while they were engaged with other musical commitments. In early 2000, Nicky Bomba, Ed Bates and James Black joined the group and in four days, they recorded a second studio album titled The Adventures of The Amazing Revelators. the album was a mix of blues and roots covers and original material. The album was released in March 2000. In November 2001, a live DVD titled Floating Bridge: Live at the Basement was released. It originally aired on ABC TV in December 2001.

Built in 1804 for Captain Thaddeus Tuttle (1758‚Äì1836), a local merchant, the building was designed by architect and surveyor John Johnson and constructed by carpenter Abram Stevens. By 1824, Tuttle had lost his fortune and had sold the property to then Governor of Vermont, Cornelius Van Ness. Named after the French Admiral, Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse, \\"Grasse Mount\\" was added to National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1973. History The land of the estate was originally owned by Ira Allen who served as an officer in the Green Mountain Boys militia (under his brother Ethan Allen) during the American Revolutionary War, and was also the founder of the University of Vermont. Allen claimed that he had been swindled out of the land by Captain Thaddeus Tuttle while he was abroad attempting to negotiate trade with England, and to purchase arms for the Vermont militia from France, at the behest of Governor Thomas Chittenden. The trip was delayed for some eight years by what was known as the Olive Branch Affair, where Allen was arrested and spent years detained in England and France. By the time of Allen's return his financial empire was in shambles, he had lost most of his land holdings, and was eventually forced to flee Burlington or face debtors' prison. Sometime before 1797, Tuttle had started his mercantile business. By 1804, the same year that he had Grasse Mount built, he had also constructed a store on the corner of Main and South Prospect Streets in Burlington, Vermont, at the building known today as \\"Bittersweet\\". Historical records indicate that Captain Tuttle had also become involved in land speculation and possessed considerable holdings within the towns of Coventry, Shelburne, and Westford, Vermont. On 1 September 1817, Tuttle sold Grasse Mount and its entire estate of about 90 acres of land to Cornelius P. Van Ness for $9,000. However, three months later Van Ness inexplicably sold the entire estate back to Tuttle for the price of five-dollars, according to the recorded quitclaim deed. The reason for this odd exchange has led to much speculation over time, but is yet unknown. On 29 April 1824, after his business had failed, Tuttle sold the estate once again to the recently elected Governor Van Ness for $6,000. The sale included all but one acre of land along the northeast corner of the property, which had been previously conveyed to Icabod Tuttle. Until his passing in 1836, Tuttle resided on the property where his store had been built, just west of the estate. Historical accounts reflect the reason for Tuttle's bankruptcy was due to his business operating primarily on the basis of barter where there was very little handling of actual monies, and therefore the construction and sustained maintenance of Grasse Mount \\"was more than he could carry\\". In 1826, Van Ness declined re-election to the Governorship and practiced law in Burlington until he accepted an appointment of United States Ambassador to Spain by President Andrew Jackson in 1829; a position he held until 1839. During this period \\"Grasse Mount\\" was so named after the French Admiral Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse by Heman Allen (nephew of Ira Allen and the former first United States Ambassador to Chile) who occupied the estate during Van Ness's absence. =Visit of General Lafayette= On July 29, 1825 during his tour of the twenty-four states of the country, the famed American Revolutionary War General, Marquis de Lafayette was entertained at the Grasse Mount estate after laying the cornerstone for the \\"South College\\" building at the University of Vermont. He did not spend the evening there according to a long-standing legend, but rather departed for Whitehall, New York around 11:00pm that evening via the steamship Phoenix, which had embarked from Burlington wharf.The History of University of Vermont Buildings: 1800‚Äì1947 By the late 19th century, such renown had been made of General Lafayette's visit that university officials had earnestly considered renaming the building Lafayette Hall. =The Leavenworth Period: 1845-1853= Grasse Mount was sold for $14,000 on 12 July 1845 to attorney Henry Leavenworth, conveyed in the deed with 81.5 acres of land. Leavenworth who was elected as a Vermont State Representative (circa 1850) did not initially dwell on the estate, and from 1845-1850 Grasse Mount was actually occupied by John Cutler. Originally, the estate extended south to what was known as Overlake Park (where a neighborhood street of the same name exists today). Leavenworth divided the land into a number of housing lots and laid out two new streets along the property; Summit Street along the eastern perimeter, and Prospect St. (currently named Maple St.) along the south. The remainder of the estate including the mansion was sold in March 1853 for $12,000 to Captain Charles B. Marvin, a retired naval officer and merchant who had survived the shipwreck of a vessel which he commanded in 1848, and then made a fortune during the 1849 California Gold Rush. =The Marvin Period: 1853-1866= Captain Marvin had married a local Burlington woman by the name of Ellen Blackman before purchasing Grasse Mount. Marvin hence financed a number of additions to the mansion, including an Italianate belvedere (cupola) structure upon the rooftop, a gas-powered illumination system, the replacement of older small-paned windows with larger- paned sash, and the replacement of wooden fireplace mantels with Italian marble. Where the exterior was painted pink with green shutters, the interior was painted with a number of ornate frescos throughout its eight main rooms, stairwell, and the cupola. Spending about $10,000 over the course of a decade, Marvin employed what historians estimate to have been at least two Italian professional artisans (most likely a master and an apprentice) who used watercolors and distempers to hand-paint numerous scenes from his seafaring years, including palm trees, shorelines, windmills, ships, international seaports, as well as cherubs, garlands, and other classical patterns in the form of Trompe-l'oeil (translated in French as \\"trick of the eye\\"), where the images convey the optical illusion of having three-dimensions. In the belvedere, the artisans employed a shadowing technique with the trompe-l'oeil panels, which suggested flooding sunlight emanating from the western windows. Because subsequent owners wallpapered, painted, added furring strips, fiberboard, and drywall over the imagery, all but that within the cupola remained undiscovered for over a century. In 1858, Marvin mortgaged the estate for $20,000 to the Bank of Burlington. Historical records also indicate that the Marvins were a mobile family. In 1862, a daughter was born to them in San Francisco, and a son in 1865 in New York. =The Barnes Period: 1866-1892= Grasse Mount during the years occupied by the Barnes family, sometime between 1866-1892 On 7 April 1866, Lawrence Barnes (1815-1886) of Hillsboro, New Hampshire, a local businessman involved in the lumber industry who served as president of the Howard Bank, and was noted for helping to introduce the marble trade in the city (as well as posthumously, becoming the namesake of the Lawrence Barnes Elementary School in Burlington) purchased the estate for $35,000 from Captain Marvin who decided to move with his family back to California during that year. By this time, the perimeter of the estate was greatly reduced, bounded by six parcels along Willard St. to the west, by Summit St. to the east, Main St. to the north, and Maple St. (n√©e Prospect St.) to the south. During the period of Barnes's ownership, a conservatory was constructed on the west side of the mansion and a two-story brick ell expanded an earlier (possibly wooden) structure on the southern side. Indoor plumbing and coal-burning fireplaces were also added. At its maximum, Grasse Mount had five fireplaces installed on the first floor and four on the second (some have since been covered over). Unimpressed with the Marvins' intricate interior artwork, referring to it as \\"them naked images\\", Barnes's wife, Lucinda painted over or wallpapered all of the frescos and paintings, except those within the belvedere. Considered to be a modernization practice of interior design of the era, much of the artwork was replaced with stenciled geometric motifs of leaves and vines. Mrs. Barnes also replaced the interior pine woodwork with stronger black walnut, and the carved wooden mantelpieces with marble pieces imported from Spain. After Lawrence Barnes's passing on 21 June 1886, Lucinda continued to occupy the home until her passing in 1892. =University of Vermont Ownership= On 19 May 1894, Edward Wells purchased the property from the Barnes family estate in order to buffer his home (which abutted Grasse Mount to the south) from potentially undesirable neighbors. The house was left empty until 1 July 1895 when the University of Vermont purchased the three-acre estate for $12,000, which was considered to be about half of the property's actual value. The mansion was hence converted into a dormitory for the university's women students, initially housing thirteen coeds. By 1966, this had increased to 29 students living at Grasse Mount. The building was utilized as a women's residence hall until 1971. For some period between 1911 and 1940, Professor Bertha Terrill who was serving as the University's first \\"Dean of Women\\" lived at Grasse Mount. In 1915, the women who lived in Grasse Mount raised the funds to install hardwood floors, replacing the old-fashioned wide boards. Further extensive repairs, redecoration, and refinishing took place in 1929. In the autumn of that year, the exterior of the building was painted in the creamy yellow color that would be recognized today. Sometime before 1930 during its years serving as a residence hall, a song had been written by the coeds who lived there and had developed a nostalgia for Grasse Mount; During 1972, a three-phase renovation project was undertaken that was intended to restore the building to its historical architectural context. Modifications first included safety and code requirements for heating, structural and electrical repairs. The second phase restored the main parlors, main circular staircase, and three bedrooms at the front of the mansion. The final phase of the project involved restoring the exterior of the building. Subsequently, the UVM Office of Continuing Education was located on the first floor, where the second floor was converted into offices that were made available to the United States Department of Agriculture. Additional restoration efforts were undertaken in 1985, costing about $700,000. Current use and occupancy Grass Mount today houses the offices of the University of Vermont Alumni Association. Grasse Mount's interior wall and ceiling paintings In 1984, workers renovating Grasse Mount for the relocation of the alumni and development offices had unexpectedly discovered unique nineteenth-century wall art, which had been hidden under layers of paint and wallpaper. Eric Groves, an architectural conservator who was working for the firm Kielman and Batten had first discovered stenciled wall and ceiling imagery on the second floor southeast chamber, which led to an extensive investigation of each room in the building. The University architect at the time, Robert Holdridge contacted the National Park Service, which referred the restoration team to the Albert K. Perry Company of Boston, Massachusetts. The company dispatched their historic decorative painting specialist Brian Powell to the find in order to help remove the layers of paint using a chemical process. The artwork from the 1850s Marvin period was revealed within thirteen rooms, where the stencil work from the 1870s Barnes era was found in four rooms. The Marvin period architectural renderings on the first floor were characterized as having the \\"touch of the master\\" and further described as \\"spontaneous, decisive, and accurate\\" according to the conservators, where the imagery in the cupola is \\"absolutely measured out to ensure proper perspective, again clear evidence that the individual (or individuals) had received more than informal training.\\" Each room where the Marvin era art had been found possessed a different theme. A ground floor parlor was found with a circular image of windmills with small ships. The circular staircase walls were adorned with ascending Corinthian columns, the northwest parlor walls were illustrated with palm trees and a rattan motif upon the ceiling, the northeast parlor fireplace is flanked with niches painted as false balconies overlooking alpine scenery, and another second story bedroom was ornamented with an image of an elevated castle that juts over a jagged peninsula. Window and door framing were topped with cartouches. One parlor was found to have an image of Samuel de Champlain discovering Lake Champlain. The three-dimensional Trompe-l'oeil imagery within the top-level cupola lantern simulates columns and capitals studded with green jewels that project the illusion of sunlight emanating through the windows. The Barnes era artwork was painted with seven spectrum colors (where the Marvin artwork used eleven colors) which emphasized the application of pink and blue, and consisted of biomorphic and stripe motifs, fleur-de-lis and tulip patterns often applied at chair height utilizing stencils complemented with freehand work. One chamber ceiling biomorphic motif was highlighted with bronze- powdered paint. According to the Perry report, \\"The clarity and luminosity of colors employed and the mixtures of designs...clearly indicates that this work was performed by an American artisan.\\" Due to the lack of an adequate budget and the immediate need for the office space, not all of the imagery was restored. In 1986, a full restoration was considered out of the question with an estimated cost of about $500,000. However, some of the rooms were restored with a \\"window\\" view to the artwork, the southeast parlor was left uncovered, and two decorated ceilings were removed to storage at the University's Fleming Museum of Art. No imagery was revealed within the ell (i.e. the rear wing of the building). Some of the imagery found on the second floor plastered ceilings had been peppered with gunfire and was therefore damaged beyond possible restoration. However, some shards were salvaged and stored with the intent that someday they could be used as evidence for recreating the ceilings. The remainder of the revealed artwork was surveyed, documented (by taking photographs and tracings), and then covered with a protective non-vinyl wallpaper, affixed with a water-based adhesive for ease of removal during future restoration work. Architecture Main entrance of Grasse Mount viewed from Main Street in Burlington, VT Grasse Mount has been recognized as the best example of a Georgian colonial house within the State of Vermont, and was included in the book \\"Great Georgian Houses of America\\", originally published by the Architects' Emergency Committee in 1933. Here the mansion was represented in an illustration with a hipped roof in place of its belvedere structure. Considered to be a sophisticated example of federal domestic architecture, Grasse Mount is a two-story brick mansion with a hipped-roof, cupola, and balustrade which runs along the perimeter of the roof adorned with cornices between the second story window bays, which are flanked by exterior louvered shutters. The space between each of the flat-arched second story windows and the cornices are adorned with alternating oval and oblong re- entrant angle swag panels. The north-facing facade is five bays wide with the first story bays situated beneath semi-circular blind arches. A brick belt course divides the first and second floors, where six Ionic pilasters originate between each bay and extend to the rooftop cornices, and summit at small urns atop the balustrade. The front door has a fanlight and colored glass sidelights, which is covered by a single story Doric portico complemented by four fluted pillars and two pilasters. The eastern side entrance is located at the center bay of the main house. The arrangement of the interior design, such as the parlor fireplace which is placed between \\"round-arched recesses\\", or the curved staircase, are considered by architectural aficionados to resemble the contemporary design of the John Warren House in Middlebury, Vermont, and may have been influenced by literature such as; \\"The Country Builder's Assistant\\" by Asher Benjamin, or \\"The Practical House Carpenter\\" by William Pain (both published in 1797). Grasse Mount exists on 4.09 acres of land. The mansion is about wide and long. The floor area of the mansion has a gross area of 35,467 ft2 and 24,817 ft2 of finished area. The first floor totals 4,839 ft2 gross area/finished area.City of Burlington, Vermont: Assessor's Office ‚Äì Property Database, Accessed November 2, 2016 Gallery Image:GrasseMountEastSide 20160910.jpgEast entrance of Grasse Mount viewed from Summit Street in Burlington, VT Image:GrasseMount late1800s.jpgGrasse Mount viewed from the northeast during the 1800s (possibly taken during the Marvin period, note the pre-existing structure in place of the ell at the rear of the building).

It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It is known for certain that the church was restored in 1803. The inscription found on an old brick in the transept, which includes the date 1395, has given rise to much commentary that has not shed light on the building's prior existence. The Armenian community used neither the Julian nor the Gregorian dating system at the time, and neither did the Romanians, leading to the conclusion that the inscription is a later forgery. However, it is true that Armenians built a church in Ia»ôi, dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God, in the 14th century. It appears to have existed in 1583-1586, when it drew the attention of a foreign visitor. According to tradition, the neighboring Saint Sabbas Church was built on the site of an Armenian church taken by the Romanian Orthodox. A second Armenian church, dedicated to Saint Gregory the Great, burned in 1827. There is evidence that Princes Mihai Racovi»õƒÉ, Nicholas Mavrocordatos and Dimitrie Cantemir granted tax exemptions to the clergy of the two parishes. Around 1830-1832, an old Armenian cemetery existed behind the Vulpe Church. It was used for those who died during epidemics and could not be buried around the city churches. The church has three bells, of which two are dated. A small one has a Latin inscription from 1607, and a larger one is written in Old Church Slavonic in 1887. Repairs were carried out in 1732, 1803 (from the foundations), 1929-1932 and, following World War II bombardment, 1946.

Palmer gained national attention with respect to his response during the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. He met with armed militants who were holding the federal facility and called them \\"patriots\\". Career Palmer began his law enforcement career in 1985, working as a corrections officer. He later served as a Deputy Sheriff, and a patrolman in John Day. He was appointed Sheriff in 2000 and elected the same year; and has since been reelected in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. =Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge= In early February 2016, militants LaVoy Finicum, Ammon Bundy, and others left the site of the occupation in Harney County in two trucks to drive to neighboring Grant County, where they expected to meet Palmer and speak at a public meeting. Just before crossing into Grant County, their motorcade was stopped by police. The occupants of one truck surrendered at the initial traffic stop. Meanwhile, in the other truck, Finicum repeatedly yelled to police that they were going to meet Palmer. Finicum then fled, speeding towards Grant County. A short way before the county line Finicum encountered a roadblock, where he was shot and killed. While this played out, Palmer was in uniform at the public meeting in Grant County, waiting to greet the militants. He did not know about the roadblock just south of the Grant county line because the FBI, and Oregon State Police considered Palmer to be a security leak. To keep Palmer in the dark about the operation, they intentionally set the roadblock in next door Harney County. Later that month, complaints were filed against Palmer by the chief of police for the city of John Day and also by the Grant County dispatcher. As of August 2016, Palmer was being investigated by the Oregon Department of Justice for allegedly tampering with public records. There were eleven pending complaints against him.

It was built from 1887 to 1897. It is also known as Tambo Shire Council Library. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former courthouse at Tambo is a timber building that was constructed in 1888 and was used for judicial purposes until 1983. It has housed the Tambo Shire Council Library since 1991. Thomas Mitchell first explored the area in 1846 and following subsequent exploration in 1858 by Augustus Charles Gregory and by William Landsborough and Nathaniel Buchanan in 1860, the first pastoral run in the area was taken up in 1861 to be soon followed by others. By 1864 most pastoral land in the area had been taken up. Tambo was the first township on the Barcoo River, the settlement having begun with the establishment of an inn when a license was granted for the Barcoo Club hotel in 1864. A town reserve on the site was proclaimed as \\"Carrangarra\\". The area developed quickly developed and in December 1864, Dr William Boyd was appointed Police Magistrate for the Mitchell District. A Clerk of Petty Sessions was appointed to Carrangarra in 1866 and in 1867 the town also had a Police Sergeant. In 1868 the town was surveyed and renamed Tambo. The first land sales were held in the following year although 50 people and 34 buildings were already present in the budding township. A mail service had been established in 1866 at the Royal Carrangarra Hotel with the publican as postmaster, but in 1874 a telegraph line was opened between Springsure and Tambo, making the town a key part of the communications network link with western Queensland. Further telegraph lines were opened to Charleville and to Blackall within a few years. A building boom occurred in the 1870s during which a hospital, bank, post office, school and courthouse were constructed. The 1874 courthouse soon proved inadequate and tenders were called on 18 November 1886 for a new building. The contract was awarded to F W Bates on 1 January 1887 at a price of ¬£1068. The new court was built to a standard plan, with a large courtroom surrounded by verandahs on three sides, placed at right angles to a row of offices at the rear. It is similar to surviving courthouses at Charleville and Mitchell. In February 1888, the people of Tambo petitioned the Colonial Secretary to have the courtroom furnished with a removable magistrate's bench, jury and witness stands so that the space could also be used for balls and other public events, there being no other public building in the town. The courthouse was ready for occupation by September 1888. Tambo Court House, circa 1902 By 1897 the Lands Office, which shared the courthouse, needed more space to conduct its business. An additional office was added to the rear of the courthouse which provided an office and counter area. Other work carried out on the building over the years was largely maintenance and little change occurred. The Tambo Shire Council acquired the building in 1983 following the erection of a new police station and court house in Tambo. In August 1991 the Tambo Shire Council Library was relocated into the former court house, which had been adapted for library purposes. The following year the offices at the rear were renovated to accommodate the Community Care Group.  Description  Tambo Public Library, 2012 The former Tambo Court House is a single-storey timber building with a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron with gables to the front elevation and over the main entrance. The building is T shaped in plan with the large rectangular courtroom set at right angles to a row of four offices to the rear, one of which has been converted into toilets. A verandah encloses the courtroom on three sides and is shaded by an awning supported on timber posts. A projecting decorative portico marks the entrance to the building, which is approached by low steps. A ramp has been constructed to the side of the building leading to the verandah. The building has been refitted to suit use as a library but some of the original furniture survives including the Magistrate's Bench and Witness Box.  Heritage listing  The former Tambo Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Court House Tambo is part of the pattern of development of Queensland's history as evidence of the importance of Tambo when it was the main communication point and administrative centre in western Queensland north of Charleville. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Courthouse is a good example of a small regional courthouse of its era, having a large courtroom with offices for magistrates and court officials to the rear in a T plan that was a standard plan for rural courthouses from the mid- nineteenth century until World War II. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Courthouse has architectural and aesthetic significance as one of a series of public buildings along the main street of Tambo, including the three successive post offices and the shire hall, which define the visual character of the township. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Court House Tambo has had a long connection with the people of Tambo and the surrounding district as the focus for the administration of justice, a venue for public events and as a public library.

While helping minorities in the Bronx area, Evelina left a big impact on the people and schools. When Antonetty died in 1984, she left legacy in education equality. As of 2016, United Bronx Parents remains active in school systems and has spread throughout the U.S. Antonetty was greatly recognized as an organized and strong leader. Early life Evelina Lopez Antonetty was born on September 19, 1922 into a poor family in Salinas, a small fishing village in Puerto Rico. She grew up as the eldest of three daughters. Her mother, Eva Cruz Lopez, sent her to live in New York with her aunt and uncle in 1933 when Antonetty was 11 years old. She went to public school in East Harlem, Wadleigh High School for Girls which was considered one of the best schools in the city. Her family moved around a lot within the Latino community. They were part of the working poor in Harlem but were relatively fortunate as Eva had a steady job. Her activism stemmed from her childhood of poverty growing up in Puerto Rico and then the exposition of the progressive politics of the Great Depression after her emigration to New York City. Her experience with rejection and discrimination in the public school district motivated her to reach out and want to help other children like her. Career In Antonetty‚Äôs teenage years, she worked for multiple political leaders, which is what drew her interest to political activism. She worked for Congressman Vito Marcantonio, an Italian-American man from Harlem, and Jes√∫s Col√≥n, a Puerto Rican born labor leader. With the experience of working for Marcantonio and Col√≥n, she moved to South Bronx where she worked for District 65 of the United Auto Workers, preparing people to enter the job force. Once she married her second husband, Donato Antonetty, she decided to stay home and raise her three children while her husband worked. When her daughter Anita started school in 1962, she decided to join the school‚Äôs parents association, which eventually led to her creating the United Bronx Parents. United Bronx Parents Founded by Evelina Antonetty and established in 1965, the United Bronx Parents encouraged parents in the South Bronx community to become more involved in their children‚Äôs education. Within this program, it provided training sessions in order to better inform parents on the evaluations of schools regarding the types of teachers and the types of educational programs that schools had to offer. Evelina Antonetty hoped that the United Bronx Parents would be able to diminish the idea that minorities were not able to get an education because they were poor but due to inequality between races. In the late 1960s, the goal of the program had altered to trying to increase bilingual education which in 1968 would make South Bronx the first to have bilingual schools. The United Bronx program originally set out to help Puerto Rican parents become more involved in the New York educational system. However, due to its success, it also led to the involvement of African American mothers as well as expanding to other cities within New York and throughout the country. Legacy In 2011, a mural was painted in the South Bronx honoring her work and dedication for the United Bronx Parents.

It is written by Santhosh Echikkanam and produced by Suvin K Varkey under the banner of Little Big Films. Vineeth Sreenivasan plays the lead and titular character of Aby. Aju Varghese, Suraj Venjaramoodu play supporting characters. Aby is a boy with a dream that he wants to fly and make an aeroplane by his own without any formal engineering education. The movie depicts how the hero struggles to make his dream come true and the obstacles he faces on his way to success and achieve glory. Plot Aby is a boy who dreams to fly. The movie begins in his childhood, where he regularly jumped out of elevated positions in an attempt to fly; often injuring himself in the process. He barely spoke a word, he is mentally disabled. He went to a special-needs school. His father worked as a policy agent, and eventually used Aby to gain sympathy of potential customers to make them sign his policies. Eventually, his mother finds out of his doings and his absence from school because of this. A big fight between them ensues and Aby's mother passes away next morning. A few years later, Aby is an adolescent and works at a mechanical workshop; now a savant in electronics. His father takes the salary to feed his alcoholism. His neighbor and girlfriend, Anumol goes to school with him, along with Kunjootan. She requests Aby to help her make a science project for a competition, which Aby agrees to. The project ends with it getting big recognition and Anumol getting rewarded with prizes. However, on the day she gets honored, Aby's father arrives and makes a scene demanding the money as Aby made the project. A feud erupts between the neighbors. His father's alcoholism grows more and more volatile as he ends up burning a mockup helicopter made by Aby using an auto- rickshaw and salvage. Aby becomes frustrated and flees the town. Aby reaches Bangalore where he meets some workers who sell salvage and scrap for money. He helps fix their phone and devises a mechanism to prank a man who was a nuisance to them. Soon, Aby becomes friends with them and joins their work. A few days later, he finds a discarded toy airplane, from where he meets G. K. Menon, an alcoholic airplane manufacturer. Menon quickly becomes fond of Aby and his wish to fly, discovering his technical intelligence in the process. Menon shares his basic knowledge with him, fuelling Aby's fascination. Soon, Menon receives a job to manufacture a light aircraft, to where Aby joins him. Aby records his conversations, learning more and more about aircraft in his free time. When the aircraft was built, Aby gets carried away and attempts to ride the aircraft and crashes it, earning Menon's frustration and anger. Menon scolds Aby and demands he go away, where he flees back to his hometown. It is now 7 years since his return, and Anumol is helping the village expand. He has gathered materials, and begins work on a glider for three years. Anumol, amidst the rekindled family feud, helps Aby build a glider, which gradually grabs the attention of media and people from distant places. This earns her anger from her father who builds hatred towards Aby and his work. On the debut of his homemade glider with hundreds of onlookers, he is halted by law enforcement who stated that he did not have paperwork, making the flight illegal. Aby, with the help of Anumol and several of his townsfolk gathers the required paperwork. His father provides the money he's saved up, showing that he is turning into a better man and leaving his alcoholism. Menon even appears, being a certified airplane manufacturer, says that Aby has built the most efficient model he has seen in his career; giving him approval. Anumol's father attempts to sabotage the paperwork, where Anumol begs and pleads to let Aby fly and not take vengeance on his dreams. Anumol's father reconsiders his actions and decides that he wants to see Aby achieve his goal. Aby's glider is now ready to go once again, with the correct paperwork filed in and now legal. However, another obstacle arises as the law enforcement gets a tip against Aby's disability paperwork and that his craft hasn't been flown by a certified pilot. Anumol's father confesses to tipping against him, with Menon vouching for Aby's mental status. This promptly evolves into a huge quarrel involving the frustrated onlookers, which Aby takes advantage of and flies the glider successfully; with the aid of Menon giving instructions. Hundreds of onlookers and the police watch with fascination, ending the argument and proud that Aby has made his dreams to reality. At present time, Aby is shown as an expert glider, selected by Air Asia in Dubai; and is seen soaring the skies with a glider as the movie ends.

C. Cummings and a group of interested players under the umbrella of the DC Sports Association (the GLBT sports group of the time for the Washington, D.C. area). The club runs several tournaments and leagues throughout the year and sponsors multiple men's and women's fall and spring teams. FTSC also organizes regular pickup games, multiple tournaments, and other events throughout the year, including the Rehoboth Beach Classic, United Night Out (UNO, D.C. United's Pride night), and a Turkey Bowl & Thanksgiving Potluck. FTSC is a member of Team DCTeam DC and the International Gay and Lesbian Football Association (IGLFA),International Gay and Lesbian Football Association and has nearly 200 paying member players of its own. FTSC are the reigning (2015) North American champions and 2016 World IGLFA champions. History =1990-1995: The Beginning= Shortly after founding, many GLBT+ soccer clubs (including the New York Ramblers, the Philadelphia Falcons, and the Atlanta Heat) reached out to the as-of-yet-unnamed FTSC to participate in a large upcoming tournament hosted by Atlanta. The club pulled together a coed team for the 1991 tournament; they did not win any medals at the tournament, but earned a highlight 1-0 win over Atlanta's \\"B team\\" on a goal by Glenn Auve with a brilliant assist by Heather Milton. Members of the clubs participating in that tournament, including JC Cummings and Heather Milton from FTSC, would ultimately join together to found the IGLFA the following year. FTSC has participated in all major IGLFA tournaments, though after the 1994 Gay Games a large number of women in the club started their own efforts, leaving FTSC as primarily male for several years. =1996-2000: Tournament Hosts= By the mid-1990s the Feds had experienced a number of ups and downs. The arrival of Meade Thayer from Boston took the club to a new, more professional direction. Meade had been one of the strong leaders of the Boston Strikers club. He moved to DC for his work, and the Feds were lucky to have him here. Meade tried a number of new coaching ideas and ultimately the club entered a team into the Washington International Soccer League (WISL). Meade's new leadership at the club pushed FTSC in a more professional direction in the middle of the decade, officially adding a team into the (WISC), founding the tournament that would evolve into the current Turkey Bowl, founding the Rehoboth Beach Classic (1999), and bidding to host the 1997 edition of IGLFA's annual tournament. FTSC won the bid with a group that had experience with the 1994 FIFA World Cup and the 1996 Summer Olympics as well as support from D.C. United, the DC mayor's office, and the DC city council. The 1997 IGLFA tournament was the largest to date, and included a women's tournament for the first time outside of the Gay Games. =2001-2006: Growth and Renewal= The winter of 2003-2004 saw the first ever women‚Äôs league teams. By 2005, the club had more than doubled in size. The men's teams also continued to grow, with FTSC sending two teams to the annual IGLFA tournament for the first time. =2007-Present: A Mature Club Thrives= FTSC continued its strong growth, breaking past 100 members by the end of 2007. The number of women's teams expanded from 2 in 2006 to 5 by 2011 while the number of men's teams increased to 5 as of 2012. The Summer of Freedom league, host by and for FTSC members, was founded in 2010. Recently, FTSC has earned major tournament success, winning the 2015 North American Division 1 championship, and the 2016 IGLFA Division 1 World Championship in Portland.

FTSC's invitation to the 1991 Atlanta tournament forced the club's founding members to come determine a name for the club. The name \\"Federal Triangles\\" had a dual purpose: the club originally played games near the Federal Triangle Metro Stop, and the pink triangle is a common LGBT symbol. FTSC's original logo was thus a soccer ball imposed on top of a pink triangle. Friends and rivals The Philadelphia Falcons were founded one year before FTSC was, and the two clubs established a close bond very early on. Three FTSC members attended a small tournament hosted by the Falcons in the spring of 1991 and highly enjoyed the experience, returning the favor later that year (but before the Atlanta tournament). The two clubs have sent joint teams to several IGLFA tournaments over the years, especially to those hosted outside the United States, the most recent example being a joint team between the two clubs taking part in the Men's 7s competition at the 2018 IGLFA World Championship.

Henkel, 201 U.S. 43 (1906), was a major United States Supreme Court case in which the Court established the power of a federal grand jury engaged in an investigation into corporate malfeasance to require the corporation in question to surrender its records. Background Edwin F. Hale, the petitioner, was the treasurer of MacAndrews and Forbes. Founded in 1850, MacAndrews and Forbes was one of six companies that were under investigation for price fixing of tobacco, in violation of the Sherman Act. In 1906, US government prosecutors served a grand jury subpoena on Hale that demanded him to testify and turn over corporate documents. Hale appeared before the jury but refused to reply to questions or to produce documents. On his company's behalf, he invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege and was held in contempt. Hale then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit, which ultimately came before the Supreme Court. Hale's argument was that a grand jury cannot require persons representing corporations to testify or demand them to produce documents unless the charges that are being investigated are first explained. Decision In a majority opinion written by Justice Henry B. Brown, the Court rejected Hale's argument by maintaining that a grand jury can examine witnesses and demand documentary evidence in connection with a probe into possible crimes, even if it did not identify the scope of its investigation. The Court then rejected Hale's privilege claim by ruling that the self- incrimination privilege provided to citizens by the Fifth Amendment did not apply to corporations. In short, the Court held that corporate employees cannot assert the privilege against self-incrimination on behalf of their employer. The Fifth Amendment guarantee \\"protects individual civil liberties, not economic business interests.\\" The principle that \\"corporations and other collective entities are treated differently from individuals\\" under the Fifth Amendment is called the collective entity rule. The defendant of record in the case was William Henkel, US Marshal. Quotes \\"There is a clear distinction between an individual and a corporation, and the latter, being a creature of the State, has not the constitutional right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at the suit of the State.\\" \\"The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the State or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend to criminate [sic] him. He owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing therefrom beyond the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights.\\" Aftermath The Court's subsequent ruling in Wilson v. United States (1911) built upon Hale v. Henkel by prohibiting corporate officers from invoking their own personal Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination to justify a failure to turn over corporate documents. Such a use of the Fifth Amendment privilege, according to the Court, would inhibit the state's visitatorial rights over corporations. Later Supreme Court decisions applied the principle established in Hale v. Henkel to unions (United States v. White (1944)), partnerships (Bellis v. United States (1974)), and sole proprietorships (United States v. Doe (1984)). The cases have reflected the Court's consistent view that the Fifth Amendment privilege should apply to only individual human beings, not artificial entities. On the other hand, the ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) granted corporations an unfettered right of political free speech, and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014) recognized corporations' religious liberties. One observer has described these two most recent rulings as \\"underscoring a deep rift on the Roberts court about the permissible (or desirable) extent of corporate personhood under the Bill of Rights.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 201 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Fuller Court References External links * United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Fuller Court Tort law Corporate case law 1906 in United States case law Grand juries in the United States ","title":"Hale v.

It was around this time that the upstart All-America Football Conference (AAFC) placed a team in Chicago, the Rockets. The new AAFC franchise publicly pushed for the Cardinals to leave town, since the city had three major football teams. Bidwill grew angry and vowed to turn his team into a profitable winner. He stunned the football world in 1947 when he outbid the Rockets for the rights to All-American, Charley Trippi, signing him to a then unprecedented $100,000 contract. Trippi was the final piece of what Bidwill called his \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\" of Paul Christman, Pat Harder, Marshall Goldberg, and Trippi. The quartet led the Cardinals to defeat their cross-town nemesis, the Chicago Bears, in the season finale to win the NFL's Western Division title with 9‚Äì3‚Äì0 record. The backfield then led the team to their first and only undisputed NFL championship in 1947. Charles Bidwill did not live see his \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\" win the 1947 title; he had died of pneumonia shortly after signing Trippi.

The car was unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, a month after its teaser trailer was released, which was titled #imaginEBugatti. It was built under the Vision Gran Turismo project, and with its looks, influenced the Bugatti Chiron's design language. The color scheme of the car is based on the 1937 Le Mans-winning Bugatti Type 57G Tank racer. Only one Vision Gran Turismo exists. The car's price is estimated to be from US$5,160,000 up to US$18,000,000.  Specifications  Rear view of the Vision Gran Turismo Side view of the Vision Gran Turismo Designed by Achim Anscheidt, Sasha Selipanov, Etienne Salome, and Frank Heyl, the Vision Gran Turismo is a two-door concept car combining the looks of a road car and a LMP1 prototype. The Vision Gran Turismo belongs under the project of the same name. The Vision Gran Turismo contains an 8.0 L quad-turbocharged W16 engine, heavily modified. The top speed has never been calculated in a real circuit, but using a virtual Circuit de la Sarthe simulator, the approximate top speed is . A seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is used, which delivers the power to all four wheels, therefore making the Vision Gran Turismo an all-wheel drive car. The car uses the pre- production Bugatti Chiron chassis #6. The car also uses a carbon fiber structure for the body, and independent suspension. Many aerodynamic features, primarily carbon fiber, are present along the Vision Gran Turismo body, with a LMP1-style shark fin and active rear wing, large front splitter, side air intakes, multiple NACA ducts, and DTM-style dive planes.  Ownership  Taking the Vision Gran Turismo to service would cost the owner US$20,000, and one set of Michelin spare tires for the Vision Gran Turismo costs the owner US$93,000. The Vision Gran Turismo also contains a crate for the owner's manuals, keys, and parts. It also contains a center lock wheel nut remover, jumper cables, four remote keys (two keys for suspension adjustment, two keys for lights and spoiler adjustments), antenna piece, and an owner's manual. Only two people in the world have purchased and owned the Vision Gran Turismo since its unveiling. The car was originally bought by Prince Badr bin Saud of Saudi Arabia through a secret bid, along with a Bugatti Chiron that contained the same color scheme as the Vision Gran Turismo. The car was then subsequently sold to Hezy Shaked, Chairman and CSO of Tillys.  Media  The Vision Gran Turismo is featured in the Polyphony Digital game Gran Turismo Sport as a Group X car (category made for Vision Gran Turismo cars and cars that do not fit into any other of the game's categories) and as a Group 1 car (category made for prototype race cars).

It was designed by Henry Charles Stanley and built from to 1994. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Plans for the crossing of Angellala Creek at east of Charleville were prepared in 1885 with the construction of the western railway extension from Roma to Charleville. Part of the Western Railway Act assented to on 25 September 1875 was repealed by the Railway Reserves Amendment Act of 1879, and the money in the Western Railway Account and all funds from land alienation were paid into Consolidated Revenue of Queensland. Construction west from Roma proceeded through the 1880s and there were approaches to build a land grant railway, into western New South Wales and to Adelaide through the south-west by several syndicates. However the Queensland Government undertook construction further west. The railway opened to East Mitchell in 1883, and after completion of the Maranoa River Bridge on 17 January 1885 into Mitchell itself. Further extensions took place to Dulbydilla on 24 August 1885, Morven on 1 March 1887 and opening through to Charleville on 1 March 1888. Angellala railway station () was named after the nearby creek. It opened as a station from 2 May 1910, and was also worked as a crossing loop. From 1929 until 1932 the station was worked unattended; however a station mistress was appointed from 1932 date until 1971. Angellala was a watering stop for locomotives, with the water tank situated at the Charleville end of the yard, and the hydrant at the Roma end. The crossing of Angellala Creek posed several design problems for the bridge designers, as it was situated in a shallow valley and extensive flood plain. The bridge across the western crossing features the longest timber trestle approach on a rail bridge in Queensland. Overall length of the structure is . The main crossing of the creek features 7 x steel spans. The approach from the west is over . It was designed in 1885 when Henry Charles Stanley was Chief Engineer. Plans were prepared for the strengthening of the bridge for heavier C17 class locomotives in 1946 when the spans were halved by installation of intermediate columns. With upgrading for main line () diesel-electric's to be used west of Roma, the main spans were strengthened with additional steel pillars in 1994. The Angellala bridge is the sixth longest in Queensland. At , the western approach is the longest approach of any railway bridge in Queensland. The riveted and gusseted half-through continuous plate girder spans are the second oldest of their type in Queensland.  Description  The Angellala Creek Bridge and approaches located at from Roma Street and consists of: * 3 x 2 x 1 x timber longitudinal with a common braced timber trestle (pier one) and common concrete piers on piers two and three * 7 x 2 x riveted half-through continuous plate girders with steel cross girders and transom tops, steel longitudinals, common concrete pier on pier four, common cast iron cylinders on concrete bases (piers five to ten), strengthened with two steel columns on concrete bases at each mid span (piers 4A to 10A) and a common concrete pier at pier eleven. * 87 x 2 x1 x timber longitudinals, common braced timber trestles (piers 12 through to 100) or common concrete piers (piers 23‚Äì26, 31‚Äì32, 34, 38, 41, 51, 53, 58, 61, 64, 66‚Äì68, 71‚Äì72, 74, 76‚Äì80, 82‚Äì83, 85, 96-98). The bridge features a maximum span of and is aligned on a straight track with the approaches being on a forty-chain curve. The abutments, piers and main spans of the bridge are original; however the approaches to the bridge have been reconstructed, and in 1994 intermediate supports allowing larger diesel-electric locomotives to operate between Roma and Charleville were incorporated into the structure.

His lost geographical work (which was preserved in later authors' books) is an important source of 9th-century history of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. His son and grandson also served as viziers.  Life  Most details of the life of Jayhani are unknown. He was the son of Ahmad Jayhani, and had a brother named Ubaydallah Jayhani. Spelling patterns in his works suggests that Persian was his native language. Yaqut al- Hamawi also recorded that Jayhani frequently used the Persian expression \\"bedƒÅw andar≈´n\\" (\\"rush in\\"). Al-Muqaddasi noted that Jayhani studied philosophy, astronomy and geometry. Furthermore, he also stated that Jayhani would assemble together foreigners and ask them about the lands and the routes to get to different territories. Jayhani was a secret adherent to Manichaeism, according to Ibn al-Nadim. During his early career, Jayhani was a student of Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, and used to give him female slaves as gifts, but later left him, due to his Kitab al-Qarabin wa'l-dhaba'ih (Book on Sacrifices and Offerings), which Jayhani disapproved. Jayhani was made guardian of Nasr II in 913. A year later, his 8-year-old ward became the ruler (emir) of the Samanid Empire and Jayhani was appointed vizier. Coin minted during the reign of Nasr II. Due to Nasr's youth, Jayhani undertook the regency of the empire. Almost immediately a series of revolts broke out within the state, the most serious being the one led by his great-uncle Ishaq ibn Ahmad. Ishaq‚Äôs sons took part in the rebellion; one son, Abu Salih Mansur, took control of Nishapur and several other cities in Khorasan. Eventually, Ishaq was captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died in Nishapur. Nasr's ascension also brought instability to the peripheries of the Samanid state. The Abbasid Caliphate managed to recover Sistan for the last time, while Ray and Tabaristan were taken by the Alid Hasan al-Utrush. Despite being unable to recover the provinces, the Samanids employed numerous local Daylamite and Gilite leaders and remained active in the struggles there. After the largest mosque of Bukhara was destroyed, Jayhani financed the erection of a minaret, according to Narshakhi. Ahmad ibn Fadlan, who met him in 921, recorded that the people referred to him as \\"the elder bulwark\\", evidencing that Jayhani was still regarded as a most influential figure in Nasr II's court. A year later, however, Abu'l-Fadl al- Bal'ami succeeded him as vizier. The date of Jayhani's death is unknown. His son, Abu Ali Jayhani, was vizier of the Samanid Empire from 938 to 941. Abu Ali's son (Abu Abdallah's grandson) held the same office between 974 and 976.  Works  Ibn al-Nadim, who confused Abu Abdallah Jayhani with his grandson, attributed four books to Abu Abdallah. Yaqut al-Hamawi, who used al-Nadim's work as a source for his own work, even caused additional confusion by blending the three consecutive generations of the Jayhani family. According to historian Istv√°n Zimonyi, the four books \\"point to an author experienced in politics, as every book is connected with state affairs\\". = The book of Routes and Kingdoms = Jayhani \\"assembled around himself some foreigners and questioned them about the countries and their revenues, the condition of roads thither, the elevation of the stars above the horizons there and the length of the meridian shadows cast by the sun\\", according to al-Muqaddasi. = Other works =  See also  * Geography and cartography in medieval Islam References  Sources   Samanid viziers 10th- century Iranian people 925 deaths 9th-century births ","title":"Abu Abdallah Jayhani"},{"id":"51491820","text":"Archer Creek is a stream in Benton County, Missouri.

Cleland was born in Twechar, Dunbartonshire, and became a policewoman (WPC) with London's Metropolitan Police Service. In March 1964, when she was 26 years old and only three years into the job, she was called on to try to coax a suicidal Scotsman, Thomas French, from jumping off the roof of a building in Bloomsbury, central London. French, originally from Glasgow, owned a garage in Cambridge, but suffered frequent bouts of depression. He had scaled the 43-foot building and held his 22-month old son Stuart whom he threatened to take with him when he jumped. He refused to speak to any of the policemen attending the scene, so Cleland was called upon in the hope that her female sensitivity and Scots voice would be familiar and calming to French. Firemen held a large circular net on the street-corner below, a large crowd gathered, and the BBC broadcast the drama live on television as Cleland sat on the parapet of the building to try to calm French. She slowly inched her way forward towards him, then after over an hour of conversation suddenly lunged forward to grab the baby. French, who did not immediately let go of his son, was pulled forward with the child, and fell onto the sloping roof. Policemen who had been waiting behind Cleland then leaped on French, who did not struggle, and after the baby had been secured, French was led off downstairs to safety. Thomas French returned to Cambridge, and died of cancer in 2007, aged 74. Stuart French only learned of the dramatic incident when he was in his teens, but had not seen the TV footage until 2015, fifty years after the incident, when it was used in a television documentary he watched. Awards Cleland was awarded the George Medal for her bravery, one of only two Scots policewomen so honoured. She married a fellow policeman, Thomas Jackson, and transferred back to Dunbartonshire. She retired from the police and became a civilian telex operator with the Scottish Criminal Records Office in Glasgow. For the last 18 years of her life she lived in Milton of Campsie. She died from cancer in 2011. Part of the TV footage of the rescue can be seen online.

Plot Cathy Andrews is an unmarried woman who dreams of having both a career as president of a conglomerate and a relationship with \\"Mr. Right,\\" a man who is sensitive, nurturing and sexy. While claiming the 1980s are a golden age to be single, she is envious seeing her friends becoming engaged in droves. She justifies her casual relationship with a man named Irving to her mother, but everyone is disappointed Irving will not be attending her workplace awards ceremony, where Cathy is nominated for employee of the year. One Saturday night, she visits Irving's apartment, to find he is entertaining another woman, Brenda. Although both women storm out on Irving, Cathy returns, and Irving attempts to explain himself. Despite momentarily thinking the affair was brief, Cathy looks into Irving's refrigerator and finds butter on a plate, lasagna and ice trays filled, and realizes it has gone on for weeks. Cathy's friend Andrea takes her out to look for another man, despite her mother's insistence she stay in the apartment and wait for Irving to call. When Cathy returns, she is disappointed to find her answering machine blank. After a failed attempt to look through personal ads, she accepts a blind date, but Andrea drives the man away with mace when he arrives, sees them both, and jokes about having two women.

Campbell was born in Ipswich, Queensland. He was the son of two store clerks who moved their family to Boonah during the Great Depression. He attended primary school in Ipswich, Boonah and Coorparoo. After winning a scholarship to attend Brisbane Grammar School in 1940, Campbell went on to university. In 1945, Campbell entered his second year of his study, attending lectures given by Dr Dorothy Hill, who had returned from World War II service in the WRANS. Her academic rigour inspired him. He took his B.Sc. with Honours from the University of Queensland in 1949 on her advice, followed by his M.Sc. in 1951 and PhD in 1958. His research was in Permian brachiopods of the Bowen and adjacent basins.  Career  Campbell was assistant geologist with the Queensland Geological Survey from 1950 to 1951, assisting in the creation of a 40-mile geological map for the Geological Society of Australia using aerial photographs at the suggestion of Dorothy Hill. He then taught mathematics at Albury Grammar School in 1951. He took up a position as a lecturer in geology at the University of New England from 1952, introducing students to the study of palaeontology and stratigraphy, in particular the Werrie Basin of New South Wales, rising to senior lecturer in 1958. In 1958, Campbell travelled to the University of Cambridge on a Nuffield Dominion Travelling Fellowship, studying at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences with Martin Rudwick. They were beginning to explore concepts of rates of evolution, beyond the traditional theories of palaeontology. In 1962, Campbell took up a position as senior lecturer in geology at the Australian National University, Canberra at the request of David Brown in 1962. He taught palaeontology. He was a Fulbright Fellow at Harvard University in 1965, studying trilobites with Professor Whittington and later Devonian lungfish. He was promoted to reader in 1965 and became dean of the Faculty of Science in 1978 until 1980. Campbell was a visiting scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, studying the histology of teeth in 1981. He was professor of geology from 1982 to 1993, a visiting scientist studying lungfish dentition at the School of Anatomy at Guy's Hospital, London in 1985, and following his retirement in 1992, became emeritus professor. Campbell died on 17 June 2017 at the age of 89. He was survived by his wife, Daphne and three children.

It was marked by William Landsborough. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 June 2009.  History  The blazed tree at Camp 69 south of Charleville was marked during William Landsborough's 1862 expedition south from the Gulf of Carpentaria in search of cross-continent explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. Burke and Wills, who had set out from Melbourne on 20 August 1860 to cross the continent from south to north, were reported missing in June 1861. Four official relief expeditions were soon organised to search for them: Alfred William Howitt's party formed in Melbourne; John McKinlay's party formed in Adelaide; Frederick Walker's party formed in Rockhampton; and William Landsborough's party formed in Brisbane (appointed by the Victorian and Queensland Governments). The Victorian government appointed Captain William Henry Norman of HMCS Victoria as Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Expedition Parties (the Walker and Landsborough expeditions). Howitt early ascertained the fate of Burke and Wills in September 1861, but the other expeditions had left before news could reach them. William Landsborough, the son of a Scottish clergyman, was an experienced bushman, explorer and part owner of Bowen Downs station in northern Queensland. In the mid 1850s he was in partnership in a station on the Kolan River in the Burnett district and from 1856 had undertaken much private exploration in search of new pastoral land. He explored and named Mount Nebo in 1856, the Broadsound district in 1857, the Comet and Nogoa Rivers in 1858, and the Bonar (Bowen) River in 1859. From Rockhampton he and Nathaniel Buchanan then traced Aramac Creek and the Thomson River to the Plains of Promise. In 1861 he applied for 15 runs of each on the Plains of Promise and with Buchanan and Edward Cornish formed the Landsborough River Co. to stock these runs, which he named Bowen Downs. He was recommended to lead the Brisbane expedition in search of Burke and Wills by the Queensland Surveyor-General, Augustus Charles Gregory. On 26 August 1861 Landsborough's expedition left Brisbane in the brig Firefly for the Gulf of Carpentaria, where Walker and his party, who had proceeded overland from Rockhampton, was to rendezvous with Norman and Landsborough at the Albert River. On 4 September 1861 the Firefly was wrecked in the Gulf but the expedition was rescued three days later by Commander Norman in the Victoria. A depot was established on the Albert River and during October, Landsborough explored the surrounding district, marking numerous trees with a distinctive broad arrow before the L. Landsborough had instructions from the Royal Society of Victoria to search for Burke and Wills south-west from the Albert River. If that failed, he also intended to search for them along Cooper's Creek and then make for Brisbane or Rockhampton. As instructed, from mid-November 1861 to mid-January 1862 he explored south-west towards Central Mount Stuart, discovering and following the Gregory River, until near the site of later Camooweal he found desert with a network of dry channels. On 30 December 1861 he reached the furthest extent of his search. Realising that rain could flood the country and isolate his starving party Landsborough struggled back to the Albert River depot, having found no trace of Burke and Wills. During this journey Landsborough named the Gregory and Herbert (later Georgina) rivers, Lake Frances, Lake Mary and the Barkly Tableland and on his return reported the area well-suited for sheep raising. Landsborough's explorations in this area contributed to the extension of Queensland's western boundary. At the time of separation from New South Wales in 1859, this had been set at longitude 141¬∞ East. In September 1860 AC Gregory had recommended to the Queensland Government that the border, which passed through the Plains of Promise, be moved to 138 East¬∞ to provide the district with access to a port in the Gulf. A year later, realising that the northern relief expeditions in search of Burke and Wills would increase knowledge of the area, Governor Bowen wrote on 5 September 1861 to the Secretary of State for the Colonies advising that Queensland legislature would protect any settlers who moved into the area, provided the western boundary of Queensland was extended to 138¬∞ East to include access to the Gulf. This was agreed to, and the boundary was altered on 12 April 1862, placing the Albert, Gregory and Herbert (Georgina) rivers and much of the Barkly Tableland, within Queensland. On his return to the Albert on 19 January 1862 Landsborough discovered that Walker, who had reached the depot and reported finding tracks on the Flinders River to the south-east, had replenished his supplies from the Victoria and had left again to resuming the search. Landsborough had the option of returning south on the Victoria or proceeding overland. As provisions were now limited, Norman was opposed to Landsborough heading south, but the explorer ignored his advice, hoping to augment his provisions at new pastoral stations along the way. The southern expedition comprised: Landsborough (commander), George Bourne (second in command), W Gleeson (a sailor by trade, but groom and cook to the expedition), Jemmy (a Queensland Native Police trooper originally from Deniliquin in New South Wales), Jacky (an Aboriginal guide from the Wide Bay district) and Fisherman (an Aboriginal guide from the Brisbane region). At 4pm on 10 February 1862 they commenced their journey south, taking 14 pack horses and 6 horses for riding. The party followed the river systems southward, averaging just over per day, and rarely travelled on a Sunday. For most of the journey they travelled through well- watered, grassed land, and the horses fared well for most of the journey. It was Fisherman's job to mark the trees at each campsite. In an 1866 publication describing his experiences on this expedition, Landsborough commented: \\"The importance of marking trees properly cannot be overrated. The marks should be made only on strong, healthy trees, and at conspicuous points; and the directions should be unmistakably clear and accurate.\\" During February and March they followed the Flinders River south-east looking for traces of Burke and Wills. They traversed the Plains of Promise and named the isolated hills visible from the Flinders River: Fort Bowen, Mount Brown and Mount Little. By early April 1862 the party was on the Thomson River, which Landsborough had explored before, following this south. Having not found a station in this area, and with rations running low, Landsborough decided to leave the Thomson and on 10 April headed east via creeks to the Barcoo River/Cooper's Creek in the \\"known\\" districts. He relied heavily on the Aborigines in his party, who obtained the assistance of local Aboriginal guides for much of the distance. By 22 April the party was working down the Barcoo, and on the night of 22/23 April experienced their first and only attack by local Aborigines. Jemmy, the Native Police trooper, was on watch and raised the alarm, which saved their lives, the explorers frightening off their attackers with gunfire. In late April 1862 Landsborough left the well-watered pastoral country along the Barcoo heading for the Nive River to the south-east, and on 1 May found old dray tracks ‚Äì evidence that they had entered known country. On 9 May Landsborough's party reached the upper reaches of the Warrego River, having found pastoralists' marked trees and deep horse tracks en route but no sign of an out-station, and that evening established Camp 67 on the left bank of a creek that they believed was the head of the Warrego. By this stage the party was starving and the next day (10 May) Landsborough made the decision to leave the Warrego and head south-south-east for the next river system in a more settled district. He had no local Aboriginal guides and for much of the time was without Jacky and Jemmy, who had backtracked to look for a missing pistol. After travelling about without finding water he decided to return to the Warrego. The horses became terribly distressed during this journey, being without water for 72 hours and travelling before water was found near the Warrego on 13 May (Camp 68). Here the party rested the next day, in part to refresh the horses and also to allow Jemmy, who had suffered a severe burn to his back after having rolled into a fire on the night of 10/11 May, to regain some strength. On 15 May the party left Camp 68 and in the evening established camp 69 on the west bank of a creek that fed into the Warrego River. On the morning of 16 May the party left camp 69 to follow the Warrego downstream south-south-west. As Fisherman had to take Jemmy's place in rounding up the horses in the morning, he and Landsborough stayed behind the rest of the party to mark trees at the camp, catching up with the others in the evening. On 21 May 1862, having continued to follow the Warrego downstream, Landsborough's party reached a station occupied by Williams and Neilsen, and learned that Burke and Wills had perished. Both Landsborough and George Bourne in their later accounts of the expedition expressed surprise on hearing that Burke and Wills had perished, having found the country well-watered for most of their journey. From Williams and Neilson, Landsborough was able to re-provision the expedition before continuing south. His party arrived at Bunnawaunah on the Darling River, a settled district, on 1 June, and continued along well-known tracks via Menindie to Melbourne, which they reached in October 1862. In Melbourne Landsborough was feted as the first explorer to cross the Australian continent north to south, and a gold-mining town in Victoria was named in his honour. Landsborough's reports on the valuable pastoral land he had encountered during the expedition sparked a rush for land in the Gulf country. However, the comparative ease with which his expedition had crossed the continent soon prompted rumour that he had been more interested in looking for new pastoral country than in searching for Burke and Wills. This he strenuously denied, and never applied for the lease of any of the pastoral country he had discovered during his crossing of the continent. The success of Landsborough's 1862 expedition was due largely to his reliance on indigenous knowledge of the terrain he traversed. His journal reveals that he rarely travelled without Aboriginal guides; there are constant references to local Aborigines leading Landsborough's party to water or to showing them the best route, or to Jemmy, Jacky or Fisherman finding water. When he lost access to this local knowledge, as in his attempt to head south-south-east from the Warrego in May 1862 (camps 67-69), his party came close to perishing. Landsborough later became a controversial police magistrate and commissioner of crown lands in Carpentaria, based at Burketown on the Albert River. Towards the end of his life he was awarded for his Gulf country discoveries, which he used to purchase a property at Caloundra, just north of Brisbane, where he died in 1886. William Landsborough has long been recognised for his contribution to the opening of western Queensland to European settlement: he has been included in Australian biographical dictionaries since the 1880s; both Queensland and Victoria have a town named in his honour; there is a Landsborough Creek south of Hughenden (a tributary of the Thomson River); the former Shire of Landsborough (later Caloundra City, and more recently Sunshine Coast Regional Council) was named after him; and numerous Queensland roads commemorate him, including the Landsborough Highway in western Queensland (linking Cloncurry, McKinlay, Kynuna, Winton, Longreach, Barcaldine, Blackall, Tambo, and Augathella with the Warrego Highway east of Charleville) and at least 15 other Landsborough roads and streets throughout the State.  Description  Close-up of the blaze, 2015 The blazed tree that marks Landsborough's Camp 69 is a Coolibah (Eucalyptus coolibah) located near a tributary of the Warrego River system on a grazing leasehold of just under , about south of Charleville off the Mitchell Highway near Bakers Bend. The blaze on the trunk reads: > V.+Q. EXPN > L.C.69 MAY 16 1862 The lettering varies, perhaps evidence of one person starting the blaze and another completing it, with the \\"V+Q\\" being broader lettering than the remainder. The blaze appears to be made on an existing Aboriginal scar, which Landsborough's party likely enlarged and cut to suit their needs.  Heritage listing  Landsborough's Blazed Tree, Camp 69 was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 June 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The blazed tree at Landsborough's Camp 69 just south of Charleville was marked on 16 May 1862 and is important for its association with the first official crossing of the Australian continent from north to south. Between February and May 1862 explorer William Landsborough left a trail of blazed trees from the Albert River in the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Warrego River near later Cunnamulla, demonstrating a practical route for driving livestock overland to north-western Queensland. Comparatively few of the blazes survive, either having grown over or trees destroyed through past clearing practices, fire, flood, termites or harsh environmental conditions. Surviving blazes associated with this expedition remain important makers of a major event in Queensland history, which precipitated a rush for pastoral land in western and north-western Queensland in the early 1860s. There are only two known surviving examples of blazed trees from the 1862 Landsborough expedition in the Charleville district, at Camp 67 and Camp 69. The lettering on these blazes remains extremely well preserved. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The blaze at Camp 69, which remains highly visible, is rare tangible evidence of a remarkable feat by Landsborough and his party as the first exploration expedition to cross the Continent from north to south, in the process opening much of western and north-western Queensland to pastoral settlement. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a special association with the work of William Landsborough (1825‚Äì1886) in exploring the western and north western districts of Queensland in 1861‚Äì1862.

As commander of HMVS Victoria, he engaged in the First Taranaki War in New Zealand and the search for explorers Burke and Wills.  Early life  William Henry Norman was born in March 1812 in Upnor, Kent, England. He entered the mercantile marine service and became a master mariner.  Marine commander  Norman was captain of , a vessel owned by Captain Farquharson for nine years. From 1848, he was the commander of Coromandel for four years. In 1851, he joined the General Screw Steam Shipping Company where he superintended the fit-out of Lady Jocelyn which he took to Australia. On returning to England, the company appointed him to Queen of the South, which he took to Australia.  Victorian Government service  One of the passengers on Queen of the South was Sir Charles Hotham, travelling to take up appointment as Governor of Victoria. A naval officer himself, Hotham was impressed with Norman and engaged his services for the new colony of Victoria. As Britain was actively at war with Russia in the Crimean War, Hotham decided that Victoria needed an armed steam sloop for its defence against Russian attack. On returning to Britain on the Queen of the South, Norman resigned his appointment with the company and commenced his engagement with the Victorian Government. Norman's first duty was to commission the construction of the vessel, HMCSS Victoria, and then sail it to Hobson's Bay in Port Phillip, Victoria. The ship was then deployed on a series of operations under Norman's command. = Port Curtis rescue mission = The operations including sailing to Port Curtis, Queensland to rescue the Victorian gold miners who had abandoned Victoria for a new Queensland gold rush and found themselves destitute; the Victorian Government offered free passage back to Victoria where workers were urgently needed. = Assistance in the First Taranaki War = In 1860, the colonial government of Victoria decided to send Victoria to New Zealand, to support British colonists fighting in the First Taranaki War against the MƒÅori people. On 19 April 1860, Victoria sailed to Hobart, embarked 134 troops from the 40th Regiment of Foot, and transported them to New Zealand. Prior to her departure, the colonial government passed an Act giving the ship legal status, but this law was overturned by Britain as an attempt to create a naval force independent of the Royal Navy. After delivering the soldiers to Auckland, Victoria performed shore bombardments and coastal patrols, while maintaining supply routes between Auckland and New Plymouth. In July, Victoria sailed to Sydney to transport General Thomas Pratt and his staff to New Zealand. Victoria was used to evacuate women and children from the town of New Plymouth, following MƒÅori attacks on the town's fortifications. In October, the ship underwent refit in Wellington, and resumed duties by delivering British reinforcements to the combat areas. As the Victorian colonial government required the ship for urgent survey work, her return was requested at the end of the year, with Victoria arriving in Melbourne in March 1861. The New Zealand Wars deployment was the first time an Australian warship had been deployed to assist in a foreign war. The legal hazards of having a colonial warship operating outside her territorial limits was rectified by declaring that all Australian warships in international or foreign waters had to be commissioned into the Royal Navy. The 12 months spent in New Zealand won Captain Norman high praise from the Governor of New Zealand, Thomas Gore Browne. = Burke and Wills rescue mission = On returning to Victoria, a few months later there was news that the Burke and Wills expedition commissioned by the Royal Society of Victoria to find an overland route from south to north of Australia were at the Gulf of Carpentaria without the means to support life. Norman and HMCS Victoria, together with other vessels, were immediately dispatched to take a search-and- rescue party to the Gulf to locate and assist Burke and Wills. While waiting in the Gulf for the search team to return, Norman undertook hydrological surveys of the Gulf and Torres Strait (an area notorious for its reefs). = Rescue of Netherby = On 14 July 1866, the ship carrying immigrants to Queensland was wrecked off King Island in Bass Strait and all the 413 passengers and 49 crew made it onshore safely, but there they were without shelter and with very limited provisions. The second officer, John Parry, led a party of crew and passengers to procure assistance from the lighthouse on the island, but there were insufficient supplies there for the number of survivors. Parry and 3 others took the 23-foot whaleboat at the lighthouse and, despite high winds and rough seas, managed to reach the Australian mainland between Point Roadknight and Barwon Heads, where they met a party of surveyors who immediately assisted them. Parry then took a horse and rode the 26 miles to Geelong from where he raised the alarm by telegram to Melbourne on 21 July. The Victorian Government immediately summoned Captain Norman to load supplies of food, blankets, tents and medicine onto Victoria and then proceed at full speed to King Island to rescue the survivors; John Parry (who had travelled to Melbourne by train from Geelong) joined the ship to help locate the survivors. Another ship, Pharos, had also independently sailed from Williamstown to render assistance to the survivors. On Monday 23 July, Norman located the wreck of Netherby and, after discussions with Netherbys Captain Owens took 230 passengers on board Victoria (as many as was possible), while off-loading supplies for those remaining on the island. Then Pharos arrived and took on board the remaining 60 survivors near the wreck site, the other 117 survivors having left the wreck site heading to the lighthouse. Having taken the rescued people to Melbourne, Victoria and Pharos returned to the lighthouse at King Island where they rescued the remaining survivors and replaced the lost whaleboat at the lighthouse. The survivors were taken by train and then by cab (a free service by the cabmen) to be accommodated in the Immigration Depot and Exhibition Building (not the present Royal Exhibition Building). Little of the luggage of the survivors was recovered and most were in a wretched state after their ordeal; the Victorian public donated clothing and funds to assist the survivors, many of whom decided to settle in Victoria rather than undertake another sea voyage to Queensland. = Introduction of salmon in Tasmania = Another mission involved Norman delivering a cargo of salmon eggs to Tasmania on Victoria to introduce salmon to Tasmania. = Commissioning of Cerberus = In about 1858, the British Government gave the Victorian Government the ironclad . Norman was dispatched to England to supervise the fit-out and then bring the ship back to Victoria.  Later life  On returning to England to fit-out Cerberus, Norman's health deteriorated. He died on 12 December 1869 in Ramsgate, Kent, England from diseases of the heart and lung and then dropsy. He was attended in his illness by his sister Jane, his wife and children being in Williamstown, Victoria.  Legacy  The Norman River and town of Normanton, both in Queensland, are named after him.

It is located 16 nautical miles southeast of Northeast Investigator Shoal, and north of Half Moon Shoal. It lies off the coast of Palawan, Philippines and consists of a few rocks that are above water at low tide that surrounded a lagoon. The rocks in the shoal dry at 1.2 metres. The lagoon has depths of up to 31 metres and contains a number of coral heads. Named features in this shoal include Observation Rock (at the northern tip of the shoal) that shows at half tide. The shoal can only be entered at high water.

It was marked by William Landsborough. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 June 2009.  History  The blazed tree at Camp 67 just south of Charleville was marked during William Landsborough's 1862 expedition south from the Gulf of Carpentaria in search of cross-continent explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills. Burke and Wills, who had set out from Melbourne on 20 August 1860 to cross the continent from south to north, were reported missing in June 1861. Four official relief expeditions were soon organised to search for them: Alfred William Howitt's party formed in Melbourne; John McKinlay's party formed in Adelaide; Frederick Walker's party formed in Rockhampton; and William Landsborough's party formed in Brisbane (appointed by the Victorian and Queensland governments). The Victorian government appointed Captain William Henry Norman of as Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Expedition Parties (the Walker and Landsborough expeditions). Howitt ascertained the fate of Burke and Wills in September 1861, but the other expeditions had left before news could reach them. William Landsborough William Landsborough, the son of a Scottish clergyman, was an experienced bushman, explorer and part owner of Bowen Downs station in northern Queensland. In the mid 1850s he was in partnership in a station on the Kolan River in the Burnett district and from 1856 had undertaken much private exploration in search of new pastoral land. He explored and named Mount Nebo in 1856, the Broadsound district in 1857, the Comet and Nogoa Rivers in 1858, and the Bonar (Bowen) River in 1859. From Rockhampton he and Nathaniel Buchanan then traced Aramac Creek and the Thomson River to the Plains of Promise. In 1861 he applied for 15 runs of each on the Plains of Promise and with Buchanan and Edward Cornish formed the Landsborough River Co. to stock these runs, which he named Bowen Downs. He was recommended to lead the Brisbane expedition in search of Burke and Wills by the Queensland Surveyor-General, Augustus Charles Gregory. On 26 August 1861 Landsborough's expedition left Brisbane in the brig Firefly for the Gulf of Carpentaria, where Walker and his party, who had proceeded overland from Rockhampton, was to rendezvous with Norman and Landsborough at the Albert River. On 4 September 1861 the Firefly was wrecked in the Gulf but the expedition was rescued three days later by Commander Norman in the Victoria. A depot was established on the Albert River and during October, Landsborough explored the surrounding district, marking numerous trees with a distinctive broad arrow before the L. Landsborough had instructions from the Royal Society of Victoria to search for Burke and Wills south-west from the Albert River. If that failed, he also intended to search for them along Cooper's Creek and then make for Brisbane or Rockhampton. As instructed, from mid-November 1861 to mid-January 1862 he explored south-west towards Central Mount Stuart, discovering and following the Gregory River, until near the site of later Camooweal he found desert with a network of dry channels. On 30 December 1861 he reached the furthest extent of his search. Realising that rain could flood the country and isolate his starving party Landsborough struggled back to the Albert River depot, having found no trace of Burke and Wills. During this journey Landsborough named the Gregory and Herbert (later Georgina) rivers, Lake Frances, Lake Mary and the Barkly Tableland and on his return reported the area well-suited for sheep raising. Landsborough's explorations in this area contributed to the extension of Queensland's western boundary. At the time of separation from New South Wales in 1859, this had been set at longitude 141¬∞ East. In September 1860 AC Gregory had recommended to the Queensland Government that the border, which passed through the Plains of Promise, be moved to 138¬∞ East to provide the district with access to a port in the Gulf. A year later, realising that the northern relief expeditions in search of Burke and Wills would increase knowledge of the area, Governor Bowen wrote on 5 September 1861 to the Secretary of State for the Colonies advising that Queensland legislature would protect any settlers who moved into the area, provided the western boundary of Queensland was extended to 138¬∞ East to include access to the Gulf. This was agreed to, and the boundary was altered on 12 April 1862, placing the Albert, Gregory and Herbert (Georgina) rivers and much of the Barkly Tableland, within Queensland. On his return to the Albert on 19 January 1862 Landsborough discovered that Walker, who had reached the depot and reported finding tracks on the Flinders River to the south-east, had replenished his supplies from the Victoria and had left again to resuming the search. Landsborough had the option of returning south on the Victoria or proceeding overland. As provisions were now limited, Norman was opposed to Landsborough heading south, but the explorer ignored his advice, hoping to augment his provisions at new pastoral stations along the way. The southern expedition comprised: Landsborough (commander), George Bourne (second in command), W Gleeson (a sailor by trade, but groom and cook to the expedition), Jemmy (a Queensland Native Police trooper originally from Deniliquin in New South Wales), Jacky (an Aboriginal guide from the Wide Bay district) and Fisherman (an Aboriginal guide from the Brisbane region). At 4pm on 10 February 1862 they commenced their journey south, taking 14 pack horses and 6 horses for riding. The party followed the river systems southward, averaging just over per day, and rarely travelled on a Sunday. For most of the journey they travelled through well-watered, grassed land, and the horses fared well for most of the journey. It was Fisherman's job to mark the trees at each campsite. In an 1866 publication describing his experiences on this expedition, Landsborough commented: \\"The importance of marking trees properly cannot be overrated. The marks should be made only on strong, healthy trees, and at conspicuous points; and the directions should be unmistakably clear and accurate.\\" During February and March they followed the Flinders River south- east looking for traces of Burke and Wills. They traversed the Plains of Promise and named the isolated hills visible from the Flinders River: Fort Bowen, Mount Brown and Mount Little. By early April 1862 the party was on the Thomson River, which Landsborough had explored before, following this south. Having not found a station in this area, and with rations running low, Landsborough decided to leave the Thomson and on 10 April headed east via creeks to the Barcoo River/Cooper's Creek in the \\"known\\" districts. He relied heavily on the Aborigines in his party, who obtained the assistance of local Aboriginal guides for much of the distance. By 22 April the party was working down the Barcoo, and on the night of 22/23 April experienced their first and only attack by local Aborigines. Jemmy, the Native Police trooper, was on watch and raised the alarm, which saved their lives, the explorers frightening off their attackers with gunfire. In late April 1862 Landsborough left the well-watered pastoral country along the Barcoo heading for the Nive River to the south-east, and on 1 May found old dray tracks ‚Äì evidence that they had entered known country. On 9 May Landsborough's party reached the upper reaches of the Warrego River, having found pastoralists' marked trees and deep horse tracks en route but no sign of an out-station, and that evening established Camp 67 on the left bank of a creek that they believed was the head of the Warrego. By this stage the party was starving and the next day (10 May) Landsborough made the decision to leave the Warrego and head south-south-east for the next river system in a more settled district. He had no local Aboriginal guides and for much of the time was without Jacky and Jemmy, who had backtracked to look for a missing pistol. After travelling about without finding water he decided to return to the Warrego. The horses became terribly distressed during this journey, being without water for 72 hours and travelling before water was found near the Warrego on 13 May (Camp 68). Here the party rested the next day, in part to refresh the horses and also to allow Jemmy, who had suffered a severe burn to his back after having rolled into a fire on the night of 10/11 May, to regain some strength. On 15 May the party left Camp 68 and in the evening established camp 69 on the west bank of a creek that fed into the Warrego River. On the morning of 16 May the party left camp 69 to follow the Warrego downstream south-south-west. As Fisherman had to take Jemmy's place in rounding up the horses in the morning, he and Landsborough stayed behind the rest of the party to mark trees at the camp, catching up with the others in the evening. On 21 May 1862, having continued to follow the Warrego downstream, Landsborough's party reached a station occupied by Williams and Neilsen, and learned that Burke and Wills had perished. Both Landsborough and George Bourne in their later accounts of the expedition expressed surprise on hearing that Burke and Wills had perished, having found the country well-watered for most of their journey. From Williams and Neilson, Landsborough was able to re-provision the expedition before continuing south. His party arrived at Bunnawaunah on the Darling River, a settled district, on 1 June, and continued along well-known tracks via Menindie to Melbourne, which they reached in October 1862. In Melbourne Landsborough was feted as the first explorer to cross the Australian continent north to south, and a gold- mining town in Victoria was named in his honour. Landsborough's reports on the valuable pastoral land he had encountered during the expedition sparked a rush for land in the Gulf country. However, the comparative ease with which his expedition had crossed the continent soon prompted rumour that he had been more interested in looking for new pastoral country than in searching for Burke and Wills. This he strenuously denied, and never applied for the lease of any of the pastoral country he had discovered during his crossing of the continent. The success of Landsborough's 1862 expedition was due largely to his reliance on indigenous knowledge of the terrain he traversed. His journal reveals that he rarely travelled without Aboriginal guides; there are constant references to local Aborigines leading Landsborough's party to water or to showing them the best route, or to Jemmy, Jacky or Fisherman finding water. When he lost access to this local knowledge, as in his attempt to head south-south-east from the Warrego in May 1862 (camps 67-69), his party came close to perishing. Landsborough later became a controversial police magistrate and commissioner of crown lands in Carpentaria, based at Burketown on the Albert River. Towards the end of his life he was awarded for his Gulf country discoveries, which he used to purchase a property at Caloundra, just north of Brisbane, where he died in 1886. William Landsborough has long been recognised for his contribution to the opening of western Queensland to non-Indigenous settlement: he has been included in Australian biographical dictionaries since the 1880s; both Queensland and Victoria have a town named in his honour; there is a Landsborough Creek south of Hughenden (a tributary of the Thomson River); the former Shire of Landsborough (later Caloundra City, and more recently Sunshine Coast Regional Council) was named after him; and numerous Queensland roads commemorate him, including the Landsborough Highway in western Queensland (linking Cloncurry, McKinlay, Kynuna, Winton, Longreach, Barcaldine, Blackall, Tambo, and Augathella with the Warrego Highway east of Charleville) and at least 15 other Landsborough roads and streets throughout the State.  Description  Blaze, 2009 The blazed tree that marks Landsborough's Camp 67 is a Coolibah (Eucalyptus coolibah) located on a levee in a small local creek that feeds into the Warrego River system, on private freehold about south of Charleville, off the Mitchell Highway. The girth of the tree measures at above ground level, and the canopy extends to from the trunk. The blaze is on the southern side of the trunk (orientation 193?) and is now close to ground level, the result of sedimentation deposited over nearly 150 years of seasonal flooding. It reads: > +Q EXPN. > L. C. 67 MAY 10 1862 The chiselled lettering is broad and has been painted to increase visibility. The blaze appears to be made on an existing Aboriginal scar, which Landsborough's party enlarged and cut to suit their needs. The scar is in width, with a visible heath of and maximum regrowth of . There is distorted regrowth on the upper lateral margins of the scar, the result of successive chainsaw cutting into the regrowth to maintain the blaze's visibility. The tree has another scar on the opposite side of the trunk to the blaze, which is most likely the result of Aboriginal people removing the bark.  Heritage listing  Landsborough's Blazed Tree, Camp 67 was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 June 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The blazed tree at Landsborough's Camp 67 just south of Charleville was marked on 10 May 1862 and is important for its association with the first official crossing of the Australian continent from north to south. Between February and May 1862 explorer William Landsborough left a trail of blazed trees from the Albert River in the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Warrego River near later Cunnamulla, demonstrating a practical route for driving livestock overland to north-western Queensland. Comparatively few of the blazes survive, either having grown over or trees destroyed through past clearing practices, fire, flood, termites or harsh environmental conditions. Surviving blazes associated with this expedition remain important makers of a major event in Queensland history, which precipitated a rush for pastoral land in western and north-western Queensland in the early 1860s. There are only two known surviving examples of blazed trees from the 1862 Landsborough expedition in the Charleville district, at Camp 67 and Camp 69. The lettering on these blazes remains extremely well preserved. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The blaze at Camp 67, which remains highly visible, is rare tangible evidence of a remarkable feat by Landsborough and his party as the first exploration expedition to cross the Continent from north to south, in the process opening much of western and north-western Queensland to pastoral settlement. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a special association with the work of William Landsborough (1825‚Äì1886) in exploring the western and north-western districts of Queensland in 1861‚Äì1862.

Malden was a historical wagon stop amidst farms during the early 19th century surge of westward migration to settle the Northwest Territory after 1790. This country store at the southern edge of West Brownsville sits in the zig-zag along PA 88 (Low Hill Rd.) and Old US 40's turn up the slope behind it towards Malden. It is also sandwiched between the river and the steep hill behind, and like other businesses along Old US 40, saw better days before the new four Lane US 40 by-passed it. Today, as it has since the US-40 roadbed was flipped northerly to miss the road through West Brownsville, the hamlet sits in the apex of a westward pointing triangle formed by the intersection of the newer early 1960s four lane Highway improvement of U.S. Route 40 and the consequent by-pass of that stretch of old historic National Highway. Thus both US-40 bridges across the Monongahela River, the Lane Bane Bridge and the Brownsville-West Brownsville Bridge connect their respective (Old/New) US-40 routes, merging just to the west side of the Malden commercial strip. Old US 40 turns left, travels past the lower Brownsville business district and several congestion causing traffic lights before turning right to cross the older Brownsville Bridge, zig through the southern part of West Brownsville and climb to Malden's east side. Both Malden and the widespread rural Borough of Centerville, its technical parent community, share the 15417 postal zip code of the Brownsville, PA post-office across the Monongahela in Fayette County, now existing real estate momentum keeps them each alive, shrinking. Just another one of several satellite communities built to support workers of area coal mines and Brownsville's once vibrant boat building, outfitting, and rust belt industries. Settled initially about 1780-1800 as the surge of emigration westward across the Alleghenies was becoming first a steady stream, then a post-war deluge as the Northwest Territory was organized by the new (first) US Congress. The area's relatively level geography atop the long climb along Nemacolin's Path and the National Road lent itself to emigrant's resting their draft animal teams and making camp, overnight or possibly to recuperate from the arduous mountain trek and the ascent from the traffic jams, congestion and general hustle & bustle of land limited Brownsville and West Brownsville. Brownsville rapidly developed into a river boat building and outfitting center and the entire four county region spawned support industries from small foundries smelting local iron ores and producing iron goods and boat hardware, to glass and pottery kilns, charcoal and fire wood, lumberjacks and sawyers. Accordingly, with a steady stream of people pushing westwards, one of the first structures erected was the Malden Inn, which also sat along the road junction with Malden Road, connecting the plateau with California, PA and other developing communities along the left bank Monongahela River. The Inn is located at one side of the small business district and today houses a more modern cultural landmark, Paci's Restaurant, which has served the tri- county area with fine dining and receptions since the 1930s. Within another block, opposite Malden road lies another local multi-county landmark, Cuppies Drive-In Theatre which began operations in 1947Landmark , later renamed the Malden Drive-in under new management operated for about 60 years before 2007, and was a well-known landmark in four counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania. and was sold by the family in 1976 and renamed the Malden Drive-In Theater. www.cinematreasures.org/theaters/10344 Since the 1970s decline in the rust belt industries, like the whole region, the neighborhood has become a relative backwater, but the commercial decline of Malden began in the early 1960s -- despite the community being centrally convenient, desirable as a satellite & upscale housing community to several larger Mon-Valley towns -- because the re-routed US-40 traffic now bypassed its small collection of commercial enterprises This improvement project locally rerouted the path of US-40 away from the main street (Market Street) through the region's former gateway town, Brownsville - away from the Old National Road and the former path of U.S. Route 40. Including a two-mile lead-in stretch of Market Street in upper Brownsville - about three miles of US-40 in eastern Washington County, Pennsylvania, was rerouted across the Lane Bane Bridge to bypass the lower business district of downtown Brownsville about 1960‚Äì61 in an attempt to mitigate chronic traffic problems. The new highway oriented nearly due east- to-west cuts through the neighborhood north of most housing, and cutting Malden Road to California. The New US40 resumes two lane operation and wyes with the Old National Road at the west end of the community. The hamlet has an old tavern landmark and former inn situated at a Tee-road junction (Malden Road to California and Charleroi) known variously in history as 'John Kreps Tavern',See this photo: 1963 survey of historic places 'The Kreppsville Inn') and most commonly today, the Malden Inn, a building on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Malden is situated along a relatively level strip of land; a stretch of Old U.S. Route 40 where the initial housing lots line the road. Two multi-street housing developments developed during the 1950s, one to either side of the highway. The development to the north is larger and has parallel streets trending up hill street to street. The south side development is a loop, older, and has a fraction of the houses, but over looks the Monongahela Valley unincorporated communities of Denbeau Heights (formerly Denbo Heights) and Denbo respectively, nearer to farther. Parent community, Brownsville, Pennsylvania was the first possible (closest) place travelers crossing the Alleghenies could reach the waters of the Ohio River and Mississippi River drainage basins. Most river banks were too steep for wagons, and on the convex side of a sweeping curve, Brownsville had several tributary streams cutting across the cliff face formed by the River's cut bank, which served to erode parts forming a ramp-like descent to the river shores. The opposite shore (West Brownsville also had several climbable slopes and the two banks were connected by a passable ford just upstream of the Brownsville Bridges built in support of the National Road. Whether by ford or bridges the Cumberland Trail continued westward by climbing up several slopes and about from West Brownsville, the road reached a relatively flat area through Malden, land-linked the Ohio River ford at Wheeling, WV to the river ford between the Brownsville's across the Monongahela River (where the mountainous terrain was behind one's wagon) through the shallow crossing south and upstream of riverboat building center of Brownsville and the flat shores of West Brownsville. The wagon road was an emigrant trail, serving to convey settlers west to the new lands of the Northwest Territory and the Mississippi River basin. The Cumberland Pike began as a privately funded toll road, between Baltimore and Cumberland, Maryland, then gradually extended westwards as improvements could be made. The toll road never reached West of Brownsville, and the balance (eventually reaching Vandalia, Illinois) was built with Federal funds to support westward migration. The part from the Monongahela to the Ohio River crossing at Wheeling, West Virginia, in general, followed the path of the western leg of the long Amerindian trail known as Nemacolin's Path or 'Chief Nemacolin's Trail', as had the Cumberland Pike through the Mountains.

In 2016 only one link (IFA 2000MW) connects France with the United Kingdom and one (Britned 1000MW) from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom. The project is being jointly developed by R√©seau de Transport d'√âlectricit√© (RTE) and FAB Link Limited. FAB Link =Cables= Twin 700 MW cables giving a capacity of 1,400 MW. According to plans, 25 km AC land cables in France, landfall will be made at Siouville-Hague, 30 km HVDC submarine cables between France and Alderney. 1 km land cables across Alderney, 140 km HVDC submarine cables with landfall at Budleigh Salterton with 20 km HVDC land cables to a converter station planned to be located near Exeter Airport with some AC land cables to connect to the grid in England. Land cables carry 400 Kv AC Voltage, The submarine voltage will be 320 Kv DC Voltage. Voltage Sourced Converters (VSC) are the preferred converter technology. =Cost and Construction Schedule = The cost is estimated at ‚Ç¨750m. The FAB project has received funding from the European Commission through the Connecting Europe Facility of ‚Ç¨7.235m In January 2017 applications for licences from the Marine Management Organisation, East Devon District Council and the States of Guernsey were submitted. Approval for the project is expected after Ofgem give their final project assessment decision in July 2017 with the final investment decision made in late 2017. The project is scheduled to commence construction in 2018 with a proposed completion by 2022. =FAB Link Electricity Interconnector= The FAB Link in Alderney is a set of cables, each 5 inches in diameter, buried 1‚Äì2 metres deep crossing Alderney at Longis Common. It connects to the undersea cables from France to Alderney and from Alderney to England. FAB Link Limited is a joint venture between Alderney Renewable Energy Limited and Transmission Investment LLP. Transmission Investment is a leading independent transmission business spanning origination, project development, acquisition management, financial structuring and asset management. By-Products FAB will facilitate the export of electricity from Tidal Turbines in Alderney‚Äôs waters. Submarine power cables need to incorporate fibre optic cables to monitor performance, which gives an excess capacity that can be used for high- speed communications. Alderney would receive rent of around ¬£70,000 per annum for the facilities they provide together with a possible reduction in electricity prices paid by consumers. =Planning problems= Unresolved conflicts about the appropriateness of this project to the island resulted in the delaying of controversial planning law changes in 2016. The unprecedented change of law would open the area known as the \\"Green Belt\\" to industrial utility development, granting FAB Link permission to lay cables across a rural part of Alderney. The retention of the preservation laws would result in the cables having to by-pass Alderney altogether. =Controversy= Some Alderney residents believe the character of Alderney would be ruined, damaging the island's seasonal tourism industry; protest demonstrations took place in 2016 and in July 2017 to this end. Others believe the link will assist future tidal turbine projects and financially benefit construction and energy production contractors.

She is an artist whose work focuses on communication, collaboration and social conflicts. She collects scraps and fragments of the world and models them, films them, draws them, tells their story in images. Not so much to point out certain abuses and even less to save the world through art, but above all to provide something to hold on to for herself and the spectator, to create order where there was chaos and through the enumerated reality to hold up a mirror that allows us to tune in to the universal everydayness, to the common, to that which in a mad world is increasingly considered uncommon. As well as film, she uses other media like drawing, writing and sculpture. Her work has been shown and supported by well known Art institutes and festivals such as the Kaaitheatre, Brussels, Kunstenfestivaldesarts, Brussels, Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp (B), and BAK, Utrecht. Her work was also shown internationally in New York, Utrecht, Casablanca, London and Vienna. In 2009 she curated the ‚ÄòTime Festival‚Äô together with Dirk Braeckman. From the perspective of their concerns about the condition and the future of the world, the curators decided to make a clear statement: Time 2009 would be a book rather than a festival, a place to think rather than an event. Her latest film ‚ÄòThe Rabbit and the Teasel‚Äô (2014) was selected for its International premiere on April 17, 2015 in one of the most important documentary festivals in Europe, Visions du Reel, in Switzerland. In September 2015 she was selected for the Moscow Biennal of Contemporary Art along with Luc Tuymans(B), Fabrice Hyber(F), Liam Gillick(USA), Gabriel Lester(NL), Birdhead(CN). In 2017 she was the laureate of the Evens Arts Prize 2017. The Evens Foundation initiates, develops and supports projects that encourage people and nations to live together harmoniously in Europe. Films By moving in 2010 from urban Belgium (Brussels) to rural Ireland (Duncormick) in a small farming community her work got a new dimension. Driven by the search of how we can connect again with our natural intuition and instincts she started a Web documentary ‚ÄòThe Black Lamb‚Äô (2010-2014). This webdoc and the film ‚ÄòThe Rabbit and the Teasel‚Äô (2014), are both inspired by the stories and memories that she registered from fellow farmers as well as my own encounters. ‚ÄòThe Rabbit and the Teasel‚Äô was selected in respected festivals as Ecofalante Environmental Film Festival, S√£o Paulo, Festival Filmer a tout prix, Brussels, Festival dei popoli, Italy and Festival Plan√®te Honn√™te, France. Her last filmproject 'I watched the white dogs of the dawn' is based on the collective memory of a disappearing fishing community. The pressure caused by European fishing quotas threatens the village‚Äôs survival. The webdoc is a first step towards a new film, which will follow on from ‚ÄòThe Rabbit and the Teasel‚Äô as the second part of a trilogy about the relationship between humans and the natural world, and about how our food chain is shaped.

The obverse depicts Venus, the patron goddess of Sulla, while Victoria drives a triga on the reverse, alluding to Sulla's victory games. The gens Naevia, occasionally written Navia, was a plebeian or patrician family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned at the time of the Second Punic War, but the first of the Naevii to obtain the consulship was Lucius Naevius Surdinus, in AD 30.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1135 (\\"Naevia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Naevius is generally regarded as a patronymic surname derived from the praenomen Gnaeus, indicating a birthmark.Chase, pp. 131, 153. Gnaeus and naevus, the usual form of the Latin word for a birthmark, were pronounced similarly, and a number of other Latin words could be spelled with either gn- or n-, such as gnatus and natus, \\"born\\".The New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. natus or gnatus. Branches and cognomina In the time of the Republic, the principal cognomina of the Naevii were Balbus and Matho. Balbus, a common surname, originally signified one who stammers.Chase, p. 110. Chase regarded Matho as a borrowing of the Greek ŒúŒ±Œ∏œâŒΩ.Chase, p. 117. Cicero stated that it was pronounced Mato, and sometimes spelled without an 'h'.Cicero, De Oratore, 48. Other Naevii bore the surnames Crista, Pollio, and Turpio, while Capella and Surdinus are found on coins.Eckhel, vol. v, p. 259. Crista refers to a crest or plume;The New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. crista.

In 2016, the President of India bestowed upon him the Padma Shri award for his lifetime work in photography. He has authored two books, including Birds of Sirpur, which he co-authored. Mondhe co-founded The Nature Volunteers Club, and along with two other co-founders, is credited with reviving the Sirpur Lake. Early life and career Mondhe first encountered photography when he was 17. He subsequently became passionate about photography during his youth. In a 2016 feature on him by the Hindustan Times, Mondhe said that he used the camera to encapsulate his vision, adding, \\"I have never considered the camera and the lens as a burden to carry, but as my extension\\". Mondhe went on to graduate from the Dusseldorf Academy of Fine Arts in Germany. Mondhe also developed an interest in sculpting, with the Nehru Centre hosting his exhibition in October 1993. The magazine India Today described his work as \\"unconventional\\", mentioning: \\"Indore-based Bhalu Mondhe uses anything that is handy ‚Äì any material and any colour, sometimes brush and sometimes fingers ‚Äì for what he calls 'playing with the material like a child'. The outcome is an unrestricted interplay of different kinds of material\\". Mondhe's exhibition titled 50 Years of Rare Art Journey was also featured at Rangdarshini Gallery, Bharat Bhavan, in Bhopal. The exhibition featured a montage showcasing 50 years of Mondhe's art creations, including 90 pieces of sculptures, images, drawings and paintings. The Pioneer, covering Modhe's exhibition, described his work as having a \\"high vision of creativity\\", mentioning that Mondhe \\"is an artist with a difference. He paints, clicks realistic photographs, molds the sculptures of his imagination and draws his ideologies on a plain paper. The way he expresses his imagination to the spectators is commendable\\". =The Sirpur lake revival= During the 1990s, Mondhe used to regularly visit the Sirpur lake during the mornings to take photographs. On one such occasion, he had a significant argument with a group of slum dwellers who were chopping down a tree. Soon after, in his effort to protect the lake and neighboring region, Mondhe co-founded The Nature Volunteers Club with ornithologist Kaustubh Rishi and journalist Abhilash Khandekar. This group of three worked towards restoring the lake's condition by patrolling the lake regularly, increasing awareness within the society about the lake, investing considerable amounts of their money, communicating with and convincing bureaucrats and politicians, apart from involving institutions like the Bombay Natural History Society and noted individuals like Sunita Narain (Centre for Science and Environment). Subsequently, due to the efforts of Mondhe and his colleagues, the Madhya Pradesh government got involved and improved the infrastructure supporting the lake, apart from fencing off the lake and surrounding region. All this resulted in the Sirpur lake finally becoming a protected water body that could securely host resident and migratory birds. Business Standard, in an article covering the environmental work of Mondhe and his colleagues, recognized their \\"remarkably successful effort\\" in saving and reviving the lake, additionally noting that \\"in two decades of effort, they have been able to win the support of the larger citizenry and also officialdom, without which such a battle could not have been won\\". Mondhe and his colleagues decided to document their efforts to save the lake in the book titled Birds of Sirpur, which Mondhe co- authored. Sunita Narain launched the book in October 2012. The book covers details of migratory and resident birds based around the lake, and documents 130 bird species with photographs. In all, Mondhe has authored two books covering birds. Padma Shri Bhalu Mondhe received Padma Shri in January 2016, one of India's highest civilian honours. The award was given for his significant work over the years in the field of photography. The President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, presented the award to him on 28 March 2016, at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential house.

The Wintour vestments are a set of Catholic vestments and altar pieces made by the English recusant Catholic and seamstress Helena Wintour (approx. 1600 - 5 May 1671). They are currently held in two halves at Douai Abbey and Stonyhurst College.  Helena Wintour's life  Helena Wintour was a recusant Catholic living in England, and a talented seamstress. Her father, Robert Wintour, was executed for his role in the Gunpowder Plot in 1605, along with Helena's uncle, Thomas Wintour. The family's status as recusant Catholics (from the Latin verb recusare, meaning \\"to refuse\\") in Protestant England meant that they were obliged to pay fines for practicing their illegal Catholic faith and often opted to send their sons abroad to be educated in Catholic colleges on the continent. Despite all the hardship suffered from practicing her religion, Helena remained a devout Catholic all her life. On her death, Helena requested that the Jesuits set up a secret Catholic school in her home of Badge Court in Worcestershire where recusant Catholics could send their children, rather than sending them across the sea to the continent.  Embroideries  Unlike some of her contemporaries, such as Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury, who employed 'broiderers' to draw out their designs for them, Helena designed and made all of her vestments herself. She designed the vestments with the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in mind; this is clear from both the symbolism she used and from her will which bequeathes all the vestments to the Society of Jesus. Shortly after Helena's death, Lady Wintour, Helena's sister-in-law, launched a campaign claiming ownership of the vestments. Since the claims were likely to attract dangerous official attention towards the Jesuits, her demands were met and she was granted half of the Wintour vestments. The Wintour collection has remained in two halves to this day; Lady Wintour's half were kept in the family until they were donated to the Benedictine community and were recently transferred to Douai Abbey Library. The half belonging to the Jesuits are now in the hands of Stonyhurst College. An exhibition in 2016 held at Douai Abbey reunited the two halves of the Wintour collection for the first time since 1671.  Symbolism  The Wintour vestments demonstrate a large array of Catholic and Jesuit symbolism. The most notable Jesuit influence on the vestments is the Jesuit IHS symbol. This symbol contains two meanings; firstly it is a simple IHS Christogram (a monogram for the Greek spelling of Jesus Christ, which translates as \\"ihsous\\") used by the Catholic Church. The Jesuit version of this christogram contains the heart and three nails in the shape of a V below the letters IHS, so that one sees IHSV. \\"IHSV\\" can be interpreted to mean In Hoc Signo Vinces, ‚ÄúIn this sign, you shall conquer‚Äù, a reference to the victory which Constantine won at the Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312 as the first Christian emperor. The heart is a reference to the sacred heart of Jesus. Other notable Jesuit influences in the vestments are the letters IG and XA, which appear on the \\"spangled\\" vestments, meaning Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier, both great founding Jesuit saints. Also frequently used are the letters \\"MAR\\", referring to Mary, Mother of Christ, with a heart pierced by a sword symbolising Simeon's prophecy in the temple. Birds are also used as symbols. For example, pelicans were seen to be a symbol of motherhood as they were thought to wound their own breasts to feed blood to their chicks. A pelican can be seen on the \\"Alleluia\\" vestments.

After Adolf Hitler came into power in 1933, Jews began to escape German-occupied Europe. Germany and Austria One day boycott of Jewish businesses in Germany on April 1 1933, organised by the National Socialists, in response to the Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933: SA members are sticking a poster to the window of a Jewish store in Berlin, inscribed with \\"Germans, Defend yourselves, Do not buy from Jews\\". In 1933, Hitler and the Jewish League agreed to the Haavara Agreement in which, over time, German Jews and their finances could and would settle in Palestine. Also, the Havaara Mark was used instead of the Deutschmark, because of its lower interest rates and used more favourably. By the end of 1933, of the 600,000 German Jews, 100,000 had already emigrated to Palestine.\\" Then, they discouraged emigration by restricting the amount of money Jews could take from German banks and imposed high emigrations taxes. The German government forbade emigration after October 1941. The German Jews who remained, about 163,000 in Germany and less than 57,000 from annexed Austria, were mostly elderly who were murdered in ghettos or taken to Nazi concentration camps, where most were killed. Jews were able to leave France until the fall of 1942. Although Jews could easily leave Germany initially, it was difficult to find countries that would take them, particularly after accepting the initial wave of immigrants in Europe, Britain, and the United States. One of the reasons that emigration was so difficult was that it began during the Great Depression. Following the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria to Germany in 1938, and forced emigration deepened the refugee crisis, the √âvian Conference was held in France to explore options for countries to immigrate to, but the key outcome of the conference was that it proved that forced emigration would not solve the problem. Another was a concern that there might be pro-Nazi spies among the refugees. It was also difficult to get out of Europe. After the war started, there were few ships that left European ports. Lisbon was a neutral port, though, from which refugees could travel. Occupied countries Europe, indicating Nazi and Axis occupation during the Holocaust =Denmark= From October 1943, Gerda II was used to ferry Jewish refugees from German occupied Denmark to neutral Sweden. It ferried some 300 Jews to safety. In October 1943, 7,000 Jews and 700 of their relatives who were not Jewish escaped Denmark for Sweden, as was coordinated by the Danish resistance movement. They travelled to Malm√∂, Sweden across the √òresund Channel. =France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and The Netherlands= Many of the French Luxembourgian, Belgian, and Dutch Jews were protected by their Country's resistances, hid in secret locations that were hard to find for the Nazis, and fled to the UK, Free France (Algeria), Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, and the USA. =Germany and Austria= Hitler came into power in Germany in 1933, when there were about 523,000 German Jews (<1% of the population) in the country. Subject to threats and persecution, Jews began to emigrate from that point until the start of World War II. In Austria, more than 50% of the Jews had left the country by May 1939 following Adolf Eichmann's program to force Jews to emigrate that began in the spring of 1938. Franz Mayer, a Jewish leader, said of Eichmann's system: \\"You put in a Jew at one end, with property, a shop, a bank account, and legal rights. He passed through the building and came out at the other end without property, without privileges, without rights, with nothing except a passport and order to leave the country within a fortnight; otherwise, he would find himself inside a concentration camp.\\" By the end of 1939, there were more than 117,000 Jews who left Austria and more than 300,000 who left the Germany. Most of them were trained in a field or college educated. Generally they were young. Many of the people who went to neighboring European countries were captured by the Nazis, and many of the 100,000 who found refuge were killed, after May 1940, when they invaded western Europe. As the Nazi regime extended into Czechoslovakia beginning in 1938 and Poland in 1939, there were more Jewish refugees. =Norway= In 1940, many Norwegian Jews were able to find a safe haven in Sweden, which was neutral. =Poland= Jews were prevented from leaving German-occupied Poland by the Schutzstaffel (SS). About 10% of the Polish Jewish population including nearly 1 million Poles, were rounded up by the Russians and sent to Siberia in intolerable circumstances and slaved and died from harsh treatment at the hands of the Russians from 1939 and 1943 and onwards. The Jews were spared harsh treatment though and some were trained in Moscow, so as to be fit to command a new Polish government after the war was over. Some of them were sent to remote areas of the Soviet Union, Siberia, or Central Asia. =Soviet Union= Jews were systematically killed as part of the Final Solution plan, starting with their removal to extermination camps and beginning in June 1941 Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and those who were unable to flee to the Asian parts of the country were methodically shot. By the end of the war, 67% of the Jews from Europe had been killed. Countries that offered refuge =Continental Europe= Despite pressure from Germany, Italy protected Jewish people in lands that it occupied in Greece, France, Dalmatia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia, as well as protecting Jews in Tunisia, between mid-1942 and September 1943. About 30,000 Jews entered Portugal through Spain, and many sought passage in Lisbon on ships bound for South America and the United States. The refugees were assisted by French and American Jewish organizations. Most travelled between 1939 and 1941, and after Germans pressured the country to limit Jews ability to travel through their country, from 1942 to 1944 there were about 7,500 people who were admitted entry to Spain for Portugal. Spanish consuls also provided identity papers so that up to 5,000 people could escape through other parts of Europe. Sweden took in Jews from Norway and Denmark. The Swiss took in nearly 30,000 Jews, but turned away 20,000 at their border. =Elsewhere= Dominican Republic In July 1938, the Dominican Republic was the only country at the √âvian Conference that said it would admit a large number of refugees. Between 1938 and 1941, Bolivia allowed for 30,000 refugees to immigrate to its country. A group of passengers from the SS St. Louis arrive in France after the ship returned to Europe. Palestine Mandatory Palestine was a destination for 18,000 Jews escaping the Nazi regime through the Balkans between 1937 and 1944. This was organized by the Zionist movement. There were more than 16,000 Jews who later were bound for Palestine on boats from the Romanian and Bulgarian ports on the Black Sea and often through Turkey for refueling. One ship MV Struma was sunk, presumably accidentally, by a Soviet submarine, in what is called the Struma disaster. United Kingdom United States The United States had about 27,000 available visas in late 1938 for individuals for refugees. At that time, consulate offices outside the US were visited by 125,000 applicants, and by June 1939, there had been more than 300,000 applicants. This was far more than the US would allow into the country due to its immigration policy. The MS St. Louis sailed from Hamburg, Germany for Cuba, who had issued transit visas for more than 900 Jewish refugees, on a voyage that occurred from May to June 1939. Once the ship had arrived, the Cubans cancelled the refugees' visas. The ship was denied permission to land in the United States and it had to make a return voyage to Europe. Of 928 returning passengers, 288 were accepted by Britain, 366 survived the war on the continent, and 254 died during the Holocaust. In 1944, the War Refugee Board (WRB) was established to assist tens of thousands of refugees, in coordination with the World Jewish Congress and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and an emergency shelter was established at Fort Ontario in New York, which housed almost 1,000 refugees. Organizations and individuals that offered relief Organizations were established to assist refugees, like the World Jewish Congress, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. There were few non-Jews that helped the Jews escape, but there were some that risked their lives for the cause. See also: Righteous Among the Nations. After the war In May 1945, European Jews were released from concentration camps or came out of hiding to find that they had lost family members and their former homes. The population of displaced persons also included more than 150,000 Jews who left eastern Europe due to violence and antisemitism. Countries continued to resist taking in Jews. The most favorable destinations by the displaced Jews was Palestine and the United States, where President Harry S. Truman issued the \\"Truman Directive,\\" on 22 December 1945 and up to 40,000 Jews entered the United States by 1 July 1948. That year, a law was enacted by Congress that increased immigration quotas to allow about 80,000 Jews, who were subject to what Truman called \\"flagrantly discriminatory\\" entry qualifications, and about 102,000 forced laborers and other individuals from the Baltics and Eastern Europe who were Christians to be admitted to the US. There were 137,450 Jewish refugees that settled in the United States between 1945 and 1952. On 14 May 1948, the state of Israel was founded and many Jews settled there.

Importantly, to understand who really owns and controls a specific media outlet it is necessary to check who is beyond the official shareholdings and scrutinise indirect, controlling and beneficial ownership which refers on shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person.Access-Info Europe, 4 November 2013, Ten recommendations on transparency of media ownership, 4 November 2013. Retrieved 30 August 2016 To be meaningful and easily accessible by the citizens and national media authorities, this information should be updated, searchable, free and reusable. Transparency of media ownership remains difficult to fulfill in most of European countries. While some EU member States have legislation ensuring transparency of media ownership in compliance to the best international standards, such legislation is still lacking in many member States and in some cases national legislation allows for hidden or indirect media ownership. A recent 2015 resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, notes with concern that media outlets are frequently owned and controlled in an opaque-manner. This is due either to the lack of national transparency provisions or to non-transparent indirect or hidden ownership schemes, often linked to political, economic or religious interests and affiliations. Overview Shimer College students demonstrate in favour of transparency in school administration, 2010 Transparency of media ownership corroborates some constitutional guarantees and individual rights which are strictly related to the inclusiveness and openness of the democratic process, in particular media pluralism and Freedom of Expression. Even if media ownership transparency is not directly addressed in key international human rights charters, transparency is a basic precondition for the effective exercise of freedom of expression and the right to obtain information enshrined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and Article 11.1 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Indeed, access to information is crucial for the good functioning of democratic societies as it enables citizens to make informed decisions and choices on social, political, economic issues affecting personal and collective life. Specifically, transparency of media ownership contributes to make the public to establish who provides the information on which to shape personal and collective choices as, for instance, knowledge of the identity and interests of the messenger can help individuals in appraising the information spread through the media. Guidelines and milestones on what media ownership transparency might entails can be found in non-binding Council of Europe documents, in particular on the Committee of Ministers' Recommendation R(94) 13 on Measures to Promote Media Transparency and Recommendation (2007)2 on Media Pluralism and Diversity of Media Content.Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)2 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on media pluralism and diversity of media content, adopted 31 January 2007 According to this recommendations, to understand who and how effectively owns or control the media the public should be in the condition of accessing the following information: * data concerning the persons or bodies participating in the structure of the media; the nature and share of such participation and, where possible, the ultimate beneficiaries of such participation; * information on the nature and extent of the interests held by persons and bodies participating in a media structure in other media and in other economic sectors; * information on the persons and bodies in the position to exercise a meaningful influence on the editorial policy of a given media; * information regarding the support measures benefiting media organisations. Another non- binding document on media ownership transparency is a 2008 Resolution from the European Parliament which encourages the \\"disclosure of ownership of all media outlets to help achieve greater transparency regarding the aims and background of the broadcasters and publishers\\".European Parliament resolution of 25 September 2008 on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union (2007/2253(INI), adopted on 25 September 2008. Retrieved 2 September 2016 According to experts and organisation advocating for media ownership transparency, such as Access-Info Europe, a human rights NGO dedicated to promoting the right to access to information in Europe, to understand who and how effectively owns or control the media, it is crucial that information provided to comprehend and assess media ownership structures are regularly updated, consistent and searchable.Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014 Also, citizens should be able to get information on all types of media actors in a given countries, whether print, broadcast, or online, foreign or domestic. In Europe, transparency of media ownership is infrequently addressed directly in domestic constitutions, and even when this happens, as in the case of Italy, Romania or Turkey, constitutional provisions do not impose a specific positive obligation on the state to ensure that citizens have access to information on media ownership. The lack of ad hoc legal provisions on media ownership transparency is partially explained with the fact that often the existing laws have been established with the aim of fulfilling other regulatory objectives, such as providing information to media regulators or for company law purposes. In many European countries, freedom of information legislation provides the basis for requesting information from competent agencies and public bodies. As a consequence, often media ownership transparency aimed at fulfilling the objective of primarily informing the public on media ownership structure is therefore often a byproduct of other measures. When assessing the state of media ownership transparency, five dimensions should be taken into account to establish who and how controls the media in a given country: * Constitutional provisions relating to media ownership transparency; * Media-related provisions regulating the disclosure of ownership information to public authorities; * Media-related provisions regulating the disclosure of ownership information directly to the citizens; * General non-media specific transparency requirements regulating disclosure rules for company ownership, such as conflict of interest rules; * Other sources providing media ownership information. Operationally many options are possible to guarantee the disclosure of information on media ownership. A simple approach is to call upon media outlets to publish relevant ownership information on an accessible website displayed or linked in the organisation's publications, transmissions or website. Alternatively, or in addition, an accessible, easy-to-navigate and searchable online database on transparency of media ownership can be developed by an independent body. In both cases, to be effective and functional, databases should be regularly updated. Also, to make possible comparisons across countries, a systematic approach to collect, record and share information should be set up, connections and interoperability among national databases should be pursued and shared standards for exchanging data on transparency of media ownership should be developed. Transparency of media ownership, media pluralism and media concentration International newspapers Transparency of media ownership is deeply interrelated with the concepts of media pluralism and media concentration and is an essential component of government obligations to guarantee a diverse and plural media environment.[Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership. Frequently Asked Questions] Specifically, media ownership transparency is crucial for promoting media pluralism, a principle set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which entails a positive obligation for the state to \\"put in place an appropriate legislative and administrative framework to guarantee effective pluralism\\".[See the sentence of the European Court of Human Rights Application no. 38433/09, Centro Europa 7 S.R.L. And Di Stefano v. Italy, judgement 7 June 2012, para. 134. Available at http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&id;=001-111399&filename;=001-111399.pdf Retrieved 2 September 2016]Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership in Europe. A report for the High-Level Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism, 2014. Retrieved 2 September 2016 One of the way for guaranteeing media pluralism is to ensure a wide diversity of media ownership, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for pluralism. Media ownership is also important in terms of pluralism as it might affects media outputs and contents while transparency empowers readers to detect and appraise owners influences on the media and its contents. The European Commission's study on Indicators for Media Pluralism (2009) recognises transparency of media ownership and/or control as a key indicators of media pluralism. Also, media ownership transparency is essential for preventing concentration of media power which can unduly influence public opinion and the political debate.Independent Study on Indicators for Media Pluralism in the Member States ‚Äì Towards a Risk-Based Approach. Prepared for the European Commission Directorate-General Information Society and Media, April 2009. Retrieved 2 September 2016 Precisely, transparency of media ownership is a precondition for assessing levels of concentration or other dimensions of diversity in a given media system. Indeed, if readers don't know who the real owners of media companies are, it is difficult to envisage measures to address media concentrations as well as conflict of interests. Transparency of media ownership and beneficial ownership The need to collect and make available to the public crucial information on media ownership, in particular beneficial ownership which in this context refers on shares of a media company held on behalf of another person, is frequently debated in Europe, but there are no agreed standards or binding commitments. In June 2013, governments of the G8 Group adopted the \\"Lough Erne Declaration\\" which included a commitment to make transparent the beneficial ownership of companies recognising the need to make this information available to relevant authorities to prevent misuse of companies. The declaration was followed by a November 2014 statement by G20 leaders setting the principles on media ownership transparency. In April 2016, following the lack of records held by the Panama-based legal firm Mossack Fonseca (the \\"Panama Papers\\"), the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain reached an agreement for easing the automatic exchange of information of beneficial ownership of companies and trusts. The five countries concerned also urged the remaining G20 countries calling for progress towards a global system for exchanging such information, to be developed, for instance, by the OECD. Even if these commitments are not specifically related to the media sector, they are important steps towards the disclosure of beneficial owners of companies, including the media ones. At the European Union level, the European Commission is working to improve the beneficial ownership provisions included in the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, adopted in 2015 and currently in the process of being transposed by EU Member States into national law. Sources of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Europe =Transparency of media ownership and domestic constitutions= There is a group of three constitutional provisions that are relevant when it comes to transparency of media ownership: * provisions which directly address media ownership transparency; * provisions which are related to freedom of speech, and * provisions concerning access to public information. Constitutional provisions recognising freedom of speech and access to information are widely included in national constitutions across Europe, and, even if they are general in nature and scope, they potentially lay the ground for media ownership transparency legislation. For instance, this is the case of Norway that shaped the Norwegian Media Ownership Act on the basis of the obligations enshrined in the constitution. In addition, constitutional provisions, which vary from country to country, do not ensure transparency of media ownership as this depends on how broadly they are construed and then implemented. This is particular relevant when the constitution does not impose a positive obligation upon the state, but simply provides the option of disclosing media ownership transparency data. Constitutions, in some cases, are more focused on disclosure of information to the government or other public body than disclosure directly to the citizens. In this case, the right to access information becomes highly relevant as it is the ground for accessing media ownership data. =Media-related provisions regulating the disclosure of media ownership information to public authorities= There is a noticeable variation across Europe concerning the extent and the type of the media sectors involved (i.e. the broadcasting sector; print and online sectors) in the provisions regulating media ownership disclosure to public bodies, which in many cases is a dedicated media authority. A crucial issue for media ownership transparency is whether and how the information provided to public authorities is comprehensive, meaningful, updated and easily accessible to the wider public. Given the variability of such provisions in Europe, and given the fact that in many countries the required data disclosure is not conceived for directly addressing media transparency, the information provided are in many cases inadequate and does not serve the objective of effectively assessing whether domestic ownership limits or prohibitions are being respected. More specifically, there are at least five reasons explaining why effective media ownership transparency is limited despite the existence of specific legislation. First, European countries legislation is not homogeneous in requiring disclosure from all three media sectors (i.e. broadcasting; print and online). This, also, creates a patchwork of databases containing different type of information, making data comparison complicated. Second, in Europe disclosure is often made to public media authorities, but in some cases disclosure is required to a specific ministry (such as the Ministry of Culture in Bulgaria, or the Ministry of Justice in Azerbaijan). This can be problematic because public bodies can have discretion in authorising media services, so any links between media authorities and executive branches should be carefully reviewed to ensure their independence from political power. Third, disclosure legislation varies extensively across Europe also in terms of the type of information required to be released (e.g. details of shareholders and size of their holdings; interests of affiliated individuals; indirect interests; interests in other media companies; sources of revenues; etc.), including different thresholds and application to different media sectors. Forth, even if media ownership transparency information released to public authorities can in principle be accessed also by the public through freedom of information legislation, in practice, however, in many cases freedom of information is not fully implemented or reliance on it may be perceived by citizens to be excessively complex and even confrontational. Checks on the data provided and on its regular updating and accuracy, as well as sanctions for failure in reporting or updating it, can help improve the quality of recorded data, which are crucial for assessing media ownership transparency. There is great variability on these sanctions across Europe, but what is common is that sanctions are rarely implemented for a series of reasons: lack of sufficient resources; lack of expertise in the authorities that should check; an unwillingness to check organisations that might have powerful political or commercial influences, etc. Also in terms of public accessibility there are considerable variations across Europe: for instance, countries like Norway and Germany developed good practices in terms of online, updated searchable databases. In particular, in Germany the competent media authorities release annual lists with data on national media outlets, including the participating interests, and publish such information on the website of the KEK, the independent Commission on Concentration of the Media. The KEK also publishes reports that are distributed to media, politicians, universities, libraries, etc. In turn, the public use of available databases depends not only on their effective accessibility, but also on factors such as public awareness and confidence in starting and handling requests. =Media- related provisions regulating the disclosure of ownership information directly to the citizens= Disclosure of media ownership transparency information directly to the public can be implemented through public registers or by posting data on a media organisation's website. In Europe, disclosure directly to the citizens is often determined not for the sake of controlling or avoiding media concentration, but rather for consumer protection purposes, resulting in the disclosure of information that are badly suited for revealing the true state of media ownership. In addition, as in the case of disclosure to public authorities, some problems impede the full implementation of the existing rules, in particular, lack of enforcement, inadequate oversight and minimal requirements. Overall, the different national regimes in place in Europe, do not properly perform the function of making clear to the citizens relevant data for meeting citizens' interests in media ownership transparency. =Non-media specific transparency requirements= Non media-related specific transparency rules can be found in other legislative acts, such as domestic and EU competition rules, that can indirectly strengthen media ownership transparency, or company laws that require the disclosure of shareholdings interests in private companies. However, while these rules can provide useful insights into company ownership, usually they do not provide real information on who actually owns and controls a media company, in particular beneficial ownership). This is because the primary objective of rules that are not media- specific is not media ownership transparency. Generally, these kind of provisions require to disclose data on the name and nationality of the owner's; address; shareholdings; founding capital, etc., but the exact rules, percentages and thresholds vary from country to country. Failure to provide the requested information generally leads to fines and sanctions, and invalidation of the company registration. Disclosure rules vary remarkably from country to country, and within each country for different types of companies. Consequently, the available data is both fragmented and incoherent, often technical in nature, thus making difficult for the public to understand and for experts to compare data across countries. =Other sources of information on media ownership transparency= Several organisations provide valuable information on media ownership to the public. For example, in Italy, the Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM) publishes annual reports, which are presented to the parliament, explaining market shares and the main stakeholders in the media market. In the Netherlands, the Commissariat for the Media (CvdM) publishes online an annual report with information on trends and developments in the media market, including data on ownership, market shares, media pluralism. At the European Union level, the MAVISE databaseMAVISE Database powered by the European Audiovisual Observatory provides information on television companies operating in Europe with the aim of enhancing transparency in the television sector. In many European countries, academics, NGOs and civil society carry out research and mapping of media ownership, and publish ad hoc publications on the topic. For instance, in Spain the platform Portal de la Comunicaci√≥nPortal de la Comunicaci√≥n (Spanish) run by the University of Barcelona effectively monitors the media providing data and statistics to the public. Similarly, in Romania the Mediaindex, managed by the Centre for Independent Journalism, provides useful information on media ownership. There are also cases of media company voluntarily providing information on their financial sources and ownership structure directly to the public through their websites. This is the case, for instance, of Il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper in Italy, the Guardian in the UK, and DV in Iceland. Finally, professional and trade organisations, such as the Norwegian Press Organisations or the Swiss Press Council, establish self-regulation provisions, codes of ethics and guidelines calling for ownership transparency. However, they usually do not provide sufficient stimulus to reveal information that can be politically and commercially sensitive. Overall, the information provided through these kind of sources and organisations, is not enough systematic or detailed for providing an adequate account of media ownership transparency.

In the context of the 1848 revolutions he was elected to the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848/49, after which he switched from the schools sector to the universities sector and built a reputation as a church historian. Life Carl Adolf Wenzeslaus Cornelius was born in W√ºrzburg, Northern Bavaria. He was his parents' first child. His father, Carl Joseph Gerhard Cornelius (1793‚Äì1843), was an actor. His mother, Friderike (born Friderike Schwadtke: 1789‚Äì1867), also came from a family of actors. The (subsequently ennobled) artist Peter von Cornelius (1783- 1867) was an uncle. The composer Peter Cornelius (1924-1874) was a cousin. His own career choice was influenced by Dr. Theodor Br√ºggemann, a highly successful secondary school teacher who in 1819 had married his aunt, Elisabeth Cornelius. Carl lived with the Br√ºggemanns from 1831, and received both career guidance and practical support from his Uncle Theodor. Cornelius studied History at Bonn and at Berlin, where his teachers included von Ranke, B√∂ckh and Karl Lachmann. On leaving university he embarked on a career as a secondary school teacher. He taught successively at schools in Emmerich and Koblenz before moving on again, in 1846, to the Collegium Hosianum, a prestigious Jesuit school at Braunsberg, then in East Prussia. In 1848 he was elected by his fellow Braunsberg citizens to represent the town at the Frankfurt Parliament, a prototype national legislature which in 1848 was seen as a possible precursor to the national parliament of a newly united liberal Germany. Within the parliament Cornelius became a member of the Casino (cautiously liberal) faction and, when the Casino faction splintered in December 1848, of the conservative-liberal Pariser Hof group that emerged from it. Faced with the opposition of governments, the ambitions of the 1848 revolution failed to gain traction, at least in the immediate term. The Frankfurt Parliament faded away: on 21 May 1849 Cornelius formally resigned from the it. He never returned to Braunsberg, his formal resignation from the school there being tendered in East 1850. Instead he now became a \\"freelance\\" academic, at this stage without any official teaching contract. Encouraged by his old Berlin tutor, Leopold von Ranke, he turned to the study of the Protestant Reformation. He received a doctorate in 1850 and a higher habilitation qualification from the University of M√ºnster in 1851, opening the way to an academic career. Sources differ over the precise dates of Cornelius' academic appointments during the next few years, but he probably remained at M√ºnster till 1854, when he took a teaching post as an associate professor at Breslau University, moving to Bonn as a full professor in 1855. In 1856 he moved to Munich, taking the post of \\"Catholic Professor\\", although there was in reality nothing particularly ultramontane or \\"romantic\\" in his historical writings. During this period, in addition to his teaching responsibilities, he was working on a two volume history of the Anabaptist Kingdom of M√ºnster, the second volume of which appeared in 1860. He also, in 1857, married Elisabeth Simrock (1829-1907), the daughter of a music publisher. German unification did not disappear from the political agenda after the disappointments of 1848/49. Initially Cornelius supported the \\"Gro√üdeutschland\\" solution which foresaw a united German state that would be administered from Vienna and incorporate those parts of the Austrian empire where German language and culture predominated. This raised various difficult issues because of the multi-national multi-ethnic nature of Austro-Hungary, however, and when unification actually took place it was based on a \\"Kleindeutschland\\" model, creating a smaller German state, completely excluding Roman Catholic Austria, with much power devolved to the regions, and national control exercised not from Vienna but from Berlin. The process of creating this new German state was deftly choreographed by Chancellor Bismarck: after 1866 Cornelius abandoned his support for \\"Gro√üdeutschland\\", becoming a huge admirer of Bismarck's approach to the unification challenge. In the intense disputes involving the Roman Catholic church that followed German unification Cornelius was a supporter of Ignaz von D√∂llinger. He supported church reforms and rejected the newly advanced dogma of papal infallibility. He was a leading supporter of what came to be known as the Old Catholic Church. In 1858 Cornelius became one of the original members of the Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Here he took responsibility for the so-called Wittelsbach Correspondence, a large archive of political papers of the Bavarian ruling house from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. After the departure of Heinrich von Sybel, Cornelius became secretary to the entire commission. He became, in addition, a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and Humanities on 28 October 1897. In his 70s Carl Adolf Cornelius undertook his final major academic project, researching and producing various books and other publications on John Calvin.

Career  McKittrick was educated at Harvard University and graduated in 1911. He joined the National City Bank in 1916, assigned to assist in opening a branch of the bank in Geneva, Switzerland. He served in the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. In the interwar years he was a banker with Lee, Higginson & Co. McKittrick was president of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) from 1940 to June 1943, under the chairmanship of Otto Niemeyer and Ernst Weber. BIS, intended to facilitate effective monetary co-operation, declared its neutrality in World War II. After the war was declared in September 1939, it was no longer possible for representatives of Germany, France or the United Kingdom to attend BIS meetings. Due to the commencement of hostilities in France, only a few miles from BIS headquarters in Basel, Switzerland, McKittrick was the only member of its assembly to attend the May 1940 annual meeting. McKittrick was a family friend of Allen Dulles, a US intelligence officer also based in Switzerland during World War II.See telegram Marjorie McKittrick to Thomas McKittrick, September 25, 1945. Series 1, Carton 5, Folder 2, Reel 6, Thomas H. McKittrick Papers. Dulles later became a Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1941 Fortune magazine claimed that Germany had gained control of BIS by purchasing shares from other shareholders. McKittrick denied allegations that the bank was being used to escape the foreign funds controls put in place by the US Government against the Axis powers. During World War II BIS received gold as interest payments from the German Reichstag which later investigations showed had been looted from the central banks of Belgium and the Netherlands. McKittrick was re- elected to the post of president of the BIS in 1942. From 1946 to 1954 McKittrick worked for the Chase National Bank, becoming a senior vice president and director. He headed a survey mission for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to India in the 1950s. He died on January 21, 1970 in Newton, New Jersey. Archives and records *Thomas H.

Cultivation No authoritatively identified specimens are known to survive. =Putative specimens= A mature open-grown large-toothed U. glabra cultivar, matching a 1903 herbarium leaf-specimen mislabelled U. montana cucullata (see External links), stands in Niddrie Mains Road, Edinburgh (grafted at ground level; girth 1.4 m) (2016). The large teeth are present along the whole leaf-margin of short shoot-leaves as well as long (see 'Cornuta'). Though 'Cornuta'-like teeth may occur near the apex, they are rare, and do not resemble the slender 'horns' that usually appear in 'Cornuta' photographs. The tree is narrow-pyramidal, with upswept branches like a Huntingdon Elm.Google Maps: 260 Niddrie Mains Rd - Google Maps (July 2012), accessdate: September 4, 2016 File:Possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh (3).jpgPossible 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh File:Possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh (2).jpgLeaves of same File:Short shoot leaves of possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata'.jpgDried short-shoot leaves of same (August) File:Long shoot leaves of possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata'.jpgDried long-shoot leaves File:Possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh (4).jpgBole Synonymy *Ulmus corylacea var. grandidentata: Dumortier, Florula Belgica, 25, 1827 ? *Ulmus Montana (: glabra) var. corylifolia: Zapalowicz, Conspectus Florae Galiciae Criticus 2: 98, 1908 ?

Career Axelman was born in Eskilstuna, Sweden, the son of the bookseller Valdemar Axelman and his wife M√§rtha (n√©e Engstr√∂m). He passed studentexamen in √ñrebro in 1951 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1955 and a Master of Philosophy degree from Uppsala University in 1956. Axelman did TV studies in England in 1956 and the United States in 1961 and 1966. Axelman was a journalist at Nerikes Allehanda and Tidningen Upsala periodically from 1952 to 1966 and was a producer at Sveriges Television and Sveriges Radio from 1956 to 1985. He produced cultural programs Prisma from 1958 to 1961 and several programs together with the artist Ardy Str√ºwer and Lasse √Öberg. Axelman was also a painter and book illustrator and held solo exhibitions in Uppsala in 1953 and 1954, Visby in 1983, 1985, 1987-1989, Stockholm 1986-1989, Grythyttan in 1987, Monaco in 1989, London in 1990 and in New York City in 1990. He was also part of joint exhibition, for example at the Liljevalchs konsthall in 1961. Axelman was also CEO of AB Stockholms Aero from 1984 and he was a member of the Society Stallbr√∂derna. =Brucebo shooting= Around two o'clock in the afternoon of 1 December 2008, Axelman shot the chairman of the Brucebo Foundation, Joakim Hansson in the back at Brucebo north of Visby on Gotland. There had been a dispute between the owner of the house, the Brucebo Foundation, and Torbj√∂rn Axelman, who previously owned the house and now rented a part of it. Axelman had lived in the house for more than 30 years, but now he would be dismissed from his lease. The trigger to the drama was when the foundation's chairman came to get the fixtures in the house. On Monday morning, the chairman of the Brucebo Foundation and an assistant were driving a truck to Brucebo to retrieve paintings, sculptures and other works of art. The intention was that the works would be recorded, cleaned and restored and then returned. A large police force was sent to the scene as well as the National Task Force. When Axelman voluntarily came out of the house at ten o'clock in the evening, he was armed and fired shots at the police. The Task Force shot Axelman in the chest and a shot in each thigh. Axelman lost a lot of blood and late at night he was treated for his gunshot wounds which was serious but not life-threatening. Hansson was consulted by the police and treated for gunshot wounds in the back, chest and hand. His general condition was described as non-life threatening. On 5 February 2009, Axelman was found guilty by the Gotland district Court, of three charges of attempted murder. According to the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine, Axelman suffered from a severe mental disorder and in need of psychiatric treatment, and that there was a risk that he would commit further offenses. The district court's sentence was established by the Svea Court of Appeal on 10 June 2010. In April 2012, Uppsala Administrative Court decided that Axelman would be released.

The majority of the High Court held that because the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was appointed for seven years and not life as required by s 72 of the Constitution, the Arbitration Court could not exercise judicial powers of the Commonwealth. Background The Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia applied to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a penalty to be imposed on J W Alexander Ltd for the breach of an award. H. B. Higgins was appointed for life as a judge of the High Court, however his appointment as President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was for seven years only. J W Alexander Ltd objected to the case being heard by the Court, arguing that the Court was not validly constituted because the President was not appointed for life. Higgins referred questions for the opinion of the High Court, by way of a stated case. Two primary issues arose in the case, whether the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could validly exercise (1) judicial power of the Commonwealth and (2) the arbitration powers of the Commonwealth. In the High Court Owen Dixon represented the Waterside Workers' Federation while Hayden Starke appeared for J W Alexander Ltd. At the time s 72 of the Constitution provided : > The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the > Parliament: (i) shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council; (ii) > shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an > address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for > such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity; (iii) shall > receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but the remuneration > shall not be diminished during their continuance in office. The case followed shortly after the Wheat Case where the High Court held that the seven year term mandated by s103 of the Constitution for members of the Inter-State Commission precluded that commission from exercising judicial powers of the Commonwealth. at p. 64 per Griffith CJ. Decision The High Court was divided with the majority of judges agreeing as to the conclusions but for different reasons such that there was no majority opinion and the ratio decidendi is, in part, uncertain. The plurality opinion is found in the judgments of Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ. = The exercise of judicial power = A majority of judges, Griffith CJ, Barton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ, held that the power to enforce awards, being convictions for offences and the imposition of penalties and punishments, are matters appertaining exclusively to judicial power.WWF v J W Alexander Ltd (1918) 25 434 at p. 444 per Griffiths CJ, pp. 454-5 per Barton J, p. 463 per Isaacs & Rich JJ and p. 481 per Powers J. Because the power conferred by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1915 was part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could only do so if the Arbitration Act complied with the requirements of a Chapter III court. Barton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ held that any judge of a Chapter III court must be appointed for life, subject only to the removal powers in section 72(ii). The life appointment must be to the particular court, not just to a court. It followed that the appointment of the President for a term of seven years was contrary to s 72 of the Constitution. Because the President was invalidly appointed, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth and the provisions conferring upon it the power to enforce its awards were, therefore, invalid. Isaacs & Rich JJ in their joint judgement held that the only power the Constitution gave the Governor-General with respect to judges under Chapter III was to appoint or, in limited circumstances, remove the judge from office. The Governor-General had no power to assign judicial duties.WWF v J W Alexander Ltd (1918) 25 434 at p. 468 per Isaacs & Rich JJ. Griffith CJ agreed with the majority that a judge must be appointed for life, however his Honour dissented as to the conclusion, holding at p 448 that being the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was not a separate judicial office, as it conferred no additional remuneration nor any personal right or advantage. As such the Governor-General was assigning these judicial duties to one of the Justices of the High Court and it was not an appointment under section 72 of the Constitution.WWF v J W Alexander Ltd (1918) 25 434 at p. 448 per Griffith CJ. In separate judgments Higgins and Gavan Duffy JJ dissented on the basis that s 72 of the Constitution did not require the appointment of a judge for life and that a person who ceased to be a judge on the expiration of that person's term of office was not removed by the Governor-General. If the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not enforce the award, then who could? Isaacs, Higgins, Powers and Rich JJ held that the award could be enforced in any Magistrates' court exercising summary jurisdiction. =The exercise of arbitration powers = The majority decision that the provisions conferring judicial power to enforce awards were invalid, raised the issue as to whether the invalidity extended to the provisions that allowed the award to be made. That is whether the invalid conferral of judicial power could be severed from the valid conferral of powers of arbitration. Isaacs, Higgins, Powers and Rich JJ held that these portions of the could be severed and that the rest of the Act was valid. Barton J dissented on the basis that the intention of parliament was that the two spheres of power \\"should coexist in the same tribunal as parts of one whole\\", such that the Act was wholly beyond the powers of the Parliament and that award was invalid and not enforceable. Griffith CJ held that the entire Act was valid and so upheld the validity of the award. His Honour however agreed with Barton J that the Act was not severable and that if the enforcement powers were invalid, as found by the majority, then the entire Act was invalid.  Significance  The effect of the decision was to uphold the validity of the award and that it was enforceable, just not in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. There was thus no immediate practical need to amend the legislation. Higgins J continued to sit as the President, exercising the arbitral powers until his resignation in 1921. He was replaced as President by Powers J. It was not until 1926 that the Parliament passed the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1926 which replaced the President with a Chief Judge who was appointed in the precise terms of s 72 of the Constitution. While the case is still quoted in relation to the extent of the judicial power,see for example at [60] per French CJ. the main significance of the decision in relation to the powers of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was subsumed by the decision in the Boilermakers case in 1956, that no Court could exercise both judicial and arbitral powers.. The case was referred to by the Attorney General in the second reading speech for the proposed referendum to provide for a retirement age for federal judges. > As long ago as 1918, the High Court held in Alexander's case that section 72 > requires that every justice of the High Court and every justice of any other > court created by the Commonwealth Parliament, and indeed every magistrate so > appointed, shall, subject to the power of removal contained in that section, > be appointed for life. It has, in consequence, been generally accepted that > justices of the High Court, and other Federal judges including magistrates, > cannot be required to retire on reaching a specified age. This is an > unsatisfactory situation. There is an almost universal practice that the > holders of public offices retire on attaining a maximum retirement age. The > reasons for this practice are well known and they do not need to be spelt > out here. The subsequent referendum was approved by a majority of electors nationwide, and in a majority of states. The constitution now requires appointment for a term expiring on the judge's age, with the consequence that the interpretation favoured by Higgins and Gavan Duffy JJ, permitting appointment for a fixed term, is not available unless there is a further constitutional amendment.

The son of a master baker, Charles learnt to bake, but ran away at the age of 22 to join the Merchant Navy.http://www.enduranceobituaries.co.uk/green.htm At an unknown time in his life, Green had an accident which resulted in the loss of one of his testicles. This resulted in Green having a somewhat squeaky and high-pitched voice, which was the source of jokes amongst his fellow crew aboard the Endurance. Whilst in Buenos Aires on board the Andes in October 1914, he heard word that Shackleton had fired the expedition's cook, for drunkenness, and was subsequently hired. During the expedition, Green was assisted by able seaman Perce Blackborow, who had come on board as a stowaway. Green, though giving to \\"ribbing\\" from his crew mates, was nonetheless looked upon as a well-liked members of the expedition. His nicknames onboard included simply Chef or Cookie. He was also sometimes called \\"Doughballs\\" due to his high-pitched voice. During the three hours a day that the men worked during their time stuck in the pack ice, Green and Blackborow were working from day to night in the galley. When the ship sank after being trapped in the Antarctic ice, he continued to cook for the crew during their camps on the Antarctic ice, with much more limited equipment and the use of a blubber stove. A few days after the crew arrived on Elephant Island, Green collapsed from exhaustion, and was ordered to rest until he recovered. After the crew were rescued, Green returned to England, though with great difficulty acquiring passage. Upon his arrival, he discovered his parents had cashed out his insurance policy, as well as his girlfriend married to another man. He joined the Royal Navy as a cook, taking part in the war. He was wounded in August 1918 whilst serving on the Destroyer H.M.S. Wakeful, and re-joined the Merchant Navy in 1919. Green was invited to re-join Shackleton on another expedition to Antarctica, the Shackleton‚ÄìRowett Expedition, along with many other crew members from Endurance. During this trip, Shackleton gave Green a set of lantern-slides before his death shortly after arrival at South Georgia. The expedition continued without Shackleton, but was not a great success. After returning to England in 1922, Green once again rejoined the Merchant Navy, working on board a variety of ships until his retirement in 1931. Green would use the lantern- slides given by Shackleton years before to give lectures and tours about the Endurance expedition later in life. He became a Fire Watcher during World War II within the city of Hull. Green was one of the last surviving members of the Endurance crew, and attended the 50th Anniversary reunion in 1964 with the two remaining survivors.http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/biography/green_charles.php He died at the age of 85 of periontitis in Hull.

She has been featured on CNN's African Voices and the BBC's Africa Business Report. Gikonyo is a Co-founder and the Chief Executive Officer at the Karen Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. Early life and education Gikonyo was born on 27 May 1950 in the village of Kiamabara near Karatina town in Nyeri County. She came from a poor family and wore her first shoes at age 13. She attended the Alliance Girls High School. Her first job was at the Kenya Railways and Harbours before she joined the university. She earned 700 Kenyan Shillings a month which was a sizable amount for her considering that her school pocket money was 20 shillings. Her first major medical encounter was when her mother was diagnosed with cancer when Gikonyo was 14 years old. But her biggest inspiration to pursue a medical career came from her elder brother, Dr Wallace Kahugu, because her mother spoke highly of him. Gikonyo went on to acquire a Bachelor‚Äôs degrees in Medicine and Surgery from the University of Nairobi, a Master‚Äôs in pediatric cardiology from the same university and a post doctoral fellowship in pediatric cardiology from the University of Minnesota in the USA. In recent times and due to her role as a CEO, she has undertaken an MBA from Daystar University. Karen Hospital and the Heart Runs Together with her husband, Betty Gikonyo raised US$14 million to build the Karen Hospital. Of this, US$8 million came from Kenya Commercial Bank, a loan that the hospital has since repaid. The hospital was constructed between 2003 and March 2006. It had 450 employees as at 2015. The hospital also has satellite branches in Chester House (in Nairobi's city centre), Karatina, Meru, Nyeri, Nakuru, Kitengela and Mombasa. She plans to open a Betty Gikonyo School of Nursing in Ngong. As part of her charity work, Gikonyo co-founded the Heart to Heart foundation, an organisation that raises funds for poor children suffering from heart ailments. In 1993, she (together with her husband) pioneered the Heart Runs, annual charity events today known as the Karen Hospital Heart Run (or the Heart to Heart Foundation Run) and the Mater Heart Run. The Mater Heart Run attracted an estimated 60,000 participants in 2015. Personal life She is married to Daniel Gikonyo, a cardiologist, Karen Hospital co-founder and the long-standing personal doctor of Kenya's third president Mwai Kibaki. They met at the University of Nairobi during her second year and were married in June 1974. She is a mother of 3 grownup children (a cardiologist, an epidemiologist and a poet) and is a grandmother to eight. Her third child, a son, was born with a speech and hearing impediment that required multiple surgeries to correct. The surgeries proved successful and he now leads a normal life.

History  Rooftop at the H√¥tel Raphael in Paris in 2019. The hotel was constructed in 1925 through the initiative of L√©onard Tauber and Constant Baverez, co- founders of the Regina (1900) and the Majestic (1908). It was constructed in the Golden Twenties era and designed by architect Andr√© Rousselot. Decorated in the Art Deco style, it was named as a tribute to the painter Raphael and the fine arts. The hotel has been a popular venue for well-known French and international artists, politicians and famous personalities. A number of films have been shot there, including Love in Paris (1996), Place Vend√¥me (1998), and the short Hotel Chevalier in 2007.

Epoch Times, 2 September 2016Uzbekistan to hold presidential election on December 4 Al Jazeera, 9 September 2016 The constitution mandated that the election be held within three months of Karimov's death. Interim President Shavkat Mirziyoyev won the elections with 90% of the vote. The elections were described by the Economist as a sham, and by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe as lacking \\"a genuine choice\\". Background According to article 96 of the constitution, when a president is incapacitated or dies in office, the Chairman of the Senate (Nigmatilla Yuldashev at the time of Karimov's death) should take over as acting President, before an election is held within three months.Uzbekistan's Constitution of 1992 with Amendments through 2011 Constitute In the event, however, Yuldashev stood aside, and parliament on 8 September voted unanimously to appoint Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev as interim President.\\"Uzbekistan Names Longtime PM Mirziyaev Interim President\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 8 September 2016. This extra-constitutional measure was made with the support of regional clans, who feared that a power struggle between the country's elites would cause instability, and so decided to support Mirziyoyev, who had been Prime Minister since 2003. According to Reuters, Mirziyoyev's negotiations with the clans to secure the presidential nomination included a promise to share power with Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Azimov and national security chief Rustam Inoyatov. Electoral system The President of Uzbekistan is elected using the two-round system, with a run-off election between the two highest-placed candidates held if no candidate receives an absolute majority of the vote in the first round.Republic of Uzbekistan IFES Campaign The following four candidates were nominated by their respective parties in September. The CEC approved their applications in October. *Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Prime Minister of Uzbekistan and interim president; Liberal Democratic Party of Uzbekistan nominee *Sarvar Otamuradov, Uzbekistan National Revival Democratic Party nominee *Narimon Umarov, Justice Social Democratic Party nominee *Khatamjon Ketmonov, People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan nominee It was widely expected that Mirziyoyev, who was Prime Minister, interim president and the leader of Uzbekistan's largest party, the Liberal Democratic Party, would win the election. During the campaign, Mirziyoyev promised to mostly continue Karimov's policies, although he also pledged to implement populist measures such as forcing state bureaucrats and local leaders to be more responsive to the people's concerns, and to establish a hotline to the president. Mirziyoyev's platform primarily focused on economic issues, promising that he would double the GDP by 2030. The other three nominees were from parties that were technically in opposition but have always supported the government's position. As in the 2015 presidential elections, the other candidates refrained from attacking other nominees and instead focused on their own pet topics. According to EurasiaNet, Ketmonov focused on disabled rights, Umarov focused on education, while Otamuratov focused on promoting patriotism and nationalism. During the campaign, government-controlled media repeated the message that if the Karimov-era autocracy ended, the only alternatives were political chaos or Islamic extremism. Each candidate was allowed to erect 624 billboards across the country during the campaign, a decrease from the 829 billboards that had been allowed in the previous election. Conduct The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)'s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which observed the elections, reported that although it had been more transparent and in line with proper electoral procedure, the need for electoral reform still showed. The ODIHR reported that the elections lacked real competition because the ruling party was in a much stronger position and due to limitations on certain freedoms, such as the right for media to report on politics in an unrestricted manner. Other irregularities reported by the OSCE include ballot stuffing and improper proxy voting. Based on the OSCE report, the Economist described the election as a sham and simply replacing \\"one strongman with another\\". Results Aftermath According to Interfax, Vladimir Putin, who has a better relationship with Mirziyoyev than with Karimov, was the first leader to call the newly elected leader and sent a congratulatory note 20 minutes after the results were announced. According to the Kremlin, the two leaders \\"confirmed their commitment to further strengthening of Russian-Uzbek relations of alliance and strategic partnership\\" during a phone call and Putin invited Mirziyoyev to visit Russia. Since Mirziyoyev had won the support of the regional clans by promising to share power with Rustam Azimov, the Deputy Prime Minister, and Rustam Inoyatov, who ran the national security apparatus, it was unclear how much power the newly elected president would actually wield. The Economist said that the real power in Uzbekistan may be in the hands of Inoyatov.

It occurs in females younger than 8 years, with the highest occurrence before the age of 2. PT is rare, occurring in 2.2-4.7% of females aged 0 to 2 years old. The exact cause of the condition is still unknown, but it has been linked to a variety of genetic, dietary and physiological factors. PT is a form of Incomplete Precocious Puberty (IPP). IPP is the presence of a secondary sex characteristic in an infant, without a change in their sex hormone levels. Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) is a more severe condition than IPP. CPP is the presentation of secondary sex characteristics, with a change in sex hormones due to alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. }CPP is an aggressive endocrine disorder with harmful developmental consequences for the patient. At the presentation of PT, diagnostics are used to ensure it isn‚Äôt early stage CPP. CPP can be differentiated from PT through biochemical testing, ultrasounds and ongoing observation. There is no treatment for PT but regular observation is important to ensure it doesn‚Äôt progress to CPP. CPP diagnosis is important as treatment is necessary.  Symptoms and signs  Premature thelarche is breast hypertrophy before puberty. This form of hypertrophy is an increase in breast tissue. PT occurs in pre-pubescent females, under the age of 8, having a peak occurrence in the first two years of life. The breast development is usually bi-lateral: both breasts show development. In some cases development may be unilateral: one breast develops. = Patterns of PT = There are four patterns of PT development. Most patients have hypertrophy followed by complete loss of the excess breast tissue (51% of cases) or loss of most excess tissue, but some remains until puberty (36% of cases). Less commonly patients have ongoing patterns of thelarche: 9.7% suffer from a cyclic pattern where the size of the breast tissue varies over time, and 3.2% experience continual increase in tissue size. = Associated Symptoms = The main symptom of PT is enlarged breast tissue in infants. Estrogen‚Äôs role in PT, also leads to increased bone age and growth in some cases. In PT these secondary symptoms are minimal: bone age only varies from actual age by a few months and growth velocity only slightly varies from the norm. Diagnostic tests will distinguish these PT secondary symptoms from the more severe bone aging and growth occurring in early CPP.  Pathophysiology  The direct pathophysiology behind PT is still unknown, but there are many postulated causes. = Estrogen = PT is linked to increased sensitivity of the breast tissue to estradiol, an estrogen derivative, in certain prepubertal individuals. Sporadic estrogen or estradiol production in the adrenal glands, follicles or ovarian cysts is also linked to the condition. = Follicle stimulating hormone = Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is secreted from the anterior pituitary. FSH plays a key role in development, growth and puberty, thus it is suspected to play a role in PT. Gondotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation testing in some patients with PT has shown a dominant response from FSH. This response is linked to active mutations in the FSH receptor and Gs-a subunit in PT. Genetic investigation indicated these mutations only account for few cases of premature PT. PT may also be caused by transient partial activation of the HPG axis. Partial activation would release a surplus of FSH from the anterior pituitary without further disruption of the HPG axis. = Other causes = The consumption or exposure to certain endocrine disrupters have also been linked to PT.  CPP and PT  PT is the benign growth of breasts in infants, while CPP is a condition that involves the frequent activation of the HPG axis in patients. PT does not require treatment, as the condition is limited to enlarged breast tissue that usually subsides with time. CPP is associated with a wider range of symptoms including thelarche, pubic hair growth, accelerated bone aging, increased growth velocity and early epiphyseal growth. If an individual is affected with CPP they will need to begin treatment immediately. CPP is treated with lutenizing hormone (LH) releasing hormone agonists. PT can impact growth velocity and bone age slightly, but CPP affects these characteristics to the point of detriment to the adult stature. Patients with suspected PT must undergo diagnostic testing to ensure it isn‚Äôt CPP or exaggerated thelarche, the intermediate stage before CPP. Notable hormone differences occur between CPP and PT patients, so studying these hormone levels is the main biochemical diagnostic used in CPP. Individuals with CPP usually have a higher basal LH levels and LH:FSH ratios. Few PT patients, 9 to 14%, are predicted to develop CPP. Observation allows clinicians to identify the presentation of CPP indicative symptoms in PT patients. No diagnostics tests can indicate if a PT patient is at risk of developing CPP.  Diagnosis  Premature thelarche does not require treatment. In PT, breast hypertrophy will usually stop completely and patients will experience regression of the breast tissue over 3 to 60 months. Less commonly, patients may remain with residual breast tissue or continue through cycles of breast hypertrophy and regression until puberty. Diagnostics are utilised in individuals with PT, especially at the presentation of other secondary sex characteristics. Diagnostics aim to ensure PT patients are not suffering from CPP. = Pelvic Ultrasounds = Pelvic ultrasounds are important in diagnosing CPP. Patients with CPP have an increased ovary and uterus size. The ovary and uterus volume of CPP patients is similar to that of females undergoing puberty. The pelvis ultrasound is problematic as a diagnostic, as there is not a specific cut-off for the uterine and ovary volumes that indicate the patient has CPP. Patients with PT should have a uterine and ovarian volume within the normal range for their age. Pelvic ultrasounds are a desirable diagnostic as they are non-invasive and easy to continually review. The pelvic ultrasound should be paired with biochemical tests to determine the presence of CPP. = Biochemical tests = Biochemical tests study the hormone levels in patients. CPP patients have elevated LH levels and peak LH:FSH ratios when compared to PT patients. It is hard to use LH as a diagnostic for CPP, as the LH assay has varying sensitivity and specificity. The GnRH stimulation test is the main diagnostic biochemical test used to distinguish PT from CPP. The GnRH test demonstrates the pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. GnRH stimulates the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. The peak LH:FSH ratio in CPP patients is similar to the ratio of pubertal females. Females with PT demonstrated a LH:FSH ratio lower than pubertal females. The disadvantages of the GnRH stimulation test is it takes a long time to perform and requires multiple collections from the patient, making the process time consuming and inconvenient. The test is highly specific but has low sensitivity as the LH hormone response is usually observed in later stages of CPP. There are also overlaps in the expected value in the GnRH test results of individuals with CPP and PT. = Combined diagnostic approach = The diagnostic inconsistency in CPP means that a combination of all of pelvic ultrasounds and biochemical tests should be paired with observation, to ensure PT doesn‚Äôt progress to CPP.  Research  = Exposure to environmental agents = Natural commodities like fennel, lavender and tea tree oils have been linked to PT. Lavender and tea tree oil have weak estrogenic activities. These estrogenic properties may cause an imbalance in endocrine signalling pathways, leading to PT in regular users of these products. Fennel tea has been studied as an endocrine disrupter linked to PT. Fennel seed oil contains anethole a compound with estrogenic effects. The tea contains fennel seed oil and regular use results in increased estradiol levels in the infant. Infants with fennel tea related PT, were given the tea as a homeopathic remedy for restlessness. The tea was consumed for at least four months before the presentation of PT symptoms. PT resulting from fennel tea subsides approximately six months after stopping the use of fennel tea. = Leptin = Leptin is an adipocyte hormone that has important implications of puberty and sex hormone secretion. Increased leptin has been linked to estrogen and estradiol secretion. Leptin has key roles in maintaining age appropriate body composition and desired weight. Leptin receptors are also found in mammary epithelial cells and leptin has been observed as a growth factor in breast tissue. Increased leptin levels have been observed in some cases of PT. The increase in leptin levels cause increased estradiol levels and development of breast tissue. = GNAS1 gene mutation = The form of PT with fluctuating hypertrophy in patients has been linked to activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene. This mutation accounts for a small number of cases of PT.

Built in 1839, it is a well-preserved and little-altered example of an early Greek Revival town hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. While no longer used for town meetings, it is still owned by the town and used for other civic purposes, included elections. Description and history The Newbury Town House is located near the geographic center of Newbury, in a rural setting on the east side of Scotch Hollow Road, roughly midway between its junctions with Fish Pond Road and Halls Lake Road. It is set back from the road, between two cemetery parcels. It is a fairly plain single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation. The principal adornment on the exterior is its entrance surround, which consists of pilasters rising to bullseye blocks and a header with a protruding central pyramidal section flanked by paneled blocks. The pilasters are decorated with early Greek Revival fretwork. The interior of the hall retains original pew-like benches, and rustic horizontal board wainscoting. with The hall was built in 1839, as a centralized place to hold town meetings, which had previously been held in individual homes or barns. The land was donated by Charles George, who also gave some of the lumber for its framing. Its entry surround is based on patterns published by Asher Benjamin. The building has seen relatively little alteration, having mainly had only basic maintenance and minor repairs. It is no longer used for town meetings, but is used as a polling place and for other types of meetings.

Their music is mostly based in the bitpop sub-genre of chiptune, but has deviated into other territories such as synthwave and EDM. Much of their inspiration comes from classic retro video game composition, often referencing and basing composition off of classic chiptune techniques in a modern context. The band has found success within the gaming enthusiast sphere, playing for events such as DreamHack and N√§rCon, as well as being relatively popular among the gaming crowd. As of 2016, the band is under their own label, after previously being under Beard Monster AB of Warner Music Sweden. They released their first album in 2007, the year after the band was formed, titled for great justice. Three years later in 2010, they would release their second, Analoga Steroider, followed up by Keygeneration in 2014. Since then, they are still producing music, turning to a singles release method before compiling the released songs into their next studio album. The first single of this series was released in 2019 titled Arcadia.  History  = Origin = In 1999, Jim Lindgren started Krull Productions, a name used online for videos created by him and others. Over time, this community developed into the ground work that would develop into Dunderpatrullen. The band would then be formed in 2006 and would soon start work on their first album. = 2007 - 2014 = Releasing their first studio album the following year that the band formed, For great justice, this album would set the stage for future releases. During this time, they also played their first live show at Storsj√∂teatern in √ñstersund Three years later in 2010, they would deliver their second release with the EP Fan, vad han skrek n√§r vi √•t pizza h√§r sist!. Soon after, they would release their second album the same year with Anologa Steroider. Afterwards, band member Magnus Lemon would leave to be succeeded by Patrik Andersson who is still with the band to this day. In 2012, Dunderpatrullen released their first music video for the song Arga Leken, which attracted the attention of other artists covering the song. That same year, they released their single Oj, Vilken √ñverraskning!. Which caught the attention of Swedish television and radio host Adam Alsing and Daniel Breitholtz, a former idol judge, resulting in a record deal. In 2013, the band announced their new and fourth member, Erik Sj√∂strand, who was formerly a member of the bitpop band Bossfight. The following year in 2014, the band released its third album, keygeneration, and would go on to perform the album for many shows around Europe.

Starting from 1998 Marsaglia posted on various newsgroups including sci.math, comp.lang.c, comp.lang.fortran and sci.stat.math several versions of the generators. All KISS generators combine three or four independent random number generators with a view to improving the quality of randomness. KISS generators produce 32-bit or 64-bit random integers, from which random floating-point numbers can be constructed if desired. The original 1993 generator is based on the combination of a linear congruential generator and of two linear feedback shift-register generators. It has a period 295, good speed and good statistical properties; however, it fails the LinearComplexity test in the Crush and BigCrush tests of the TestU01 suite. A newer version from 1999 is based on a linear congruential generator, a 3-shift linear feedback shift-register and two multiply-with-carry generators. It is 10‚Äì20% slower than the 1993 version but has a larger period 2123 and passes all tests in TestU01. In 2009 Marsaglia presented a version based on 64-bit integers (appropriate for 64-bit processors) which combines a multiply-with-carry generator, a Xorshift generator and a linear congruential generator. It has a period of around 2250 (around 1075).

The Governor's mansion, which he named \\"Mount Lavinia House\\" is now the Mount Lavinia Hotel and the village that surrounded the building has subsequently developed into a bustling area, taking its name from the Governor's mistress, Lovina. There are other explanations rooted in geography and the natural surroundings, when it comes to the origin of the name Mount Lavinia. The Sinhalese who lived on the coastal belt had named the promontory \\"Lihiniya Kanda\\" or \\"Lihiniyagala\\" meaning the hill of the sea gull or the rock of the sea gull. The local name for the town today is Galkissa - Kissa being a somewhat obsolete Sinhala word for rock. The town came into official recognition when Governor Maitland used the postal address Mt. Lavinia, Ceylon, in 1805, while writing to the British Secretary of State, Lord Castlereagh. The suburb also boasts S.Thomas' College, one of Sri Lanka's most prestigious primary and secondary schools.
