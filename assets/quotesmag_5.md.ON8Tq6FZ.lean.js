It is about nose jobs (rhinoplasty) in Iran, which statistically has the most of any country. The documentary employs a semi-comedic tone, with the title referencing the earlier film Divorce, Iranian Style. Nose, Iranian Style relates the trend to politics, with it and the 2007 documentary Tehran: 11 pm connecting it to the importance of appearance, given the taboo of men and women directly and socially interacting. However, Oskouei said the film was truly a critique of excessive consumerism.

Livy gives Marcus then Lucius, Diodorus Siculus mentions a Caius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Marcus.  Biography  Lucius Sergius Esquilinus was one of the ten members of the second decemvirate, presided over by Appius Claudius Sabinus and elected for the writing of the Twelve Tables, first body of written law protecting Roman rights. At the instigation of Sabinus, the decemvirs had maintained their power illegally the following year, refusing to proceed in the election of consuls.Cicero, De Republica, II.61 That year, the Sabines' occupied Eretum, while the Aequi were camped on Mount Algidus. Roman troops were divided into two armies so they could fight on two fronts. Esquilinus received command of the army opposing the Aequi, with three other decemvirs, Lucius Minucius, Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis, and Titus Antonius Merenda. Meanwhile, Sabinus and Spurius Oppius Cornicen stayed in Rome to assure the defense of the city, and four other decemvirs went against the Sabines.Livy, ab urbe condita, III.38.42Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, XI.2 The two Roman armies were held in check on each front. The army commanded by Esquilinus withdrew to Tusculum then answered the call of Lucius Verginius whose daughter had been reduced to slavery by Sabinus during one of his scandalous trials. After that infamous trial, Verginius had been forced to kill his own daughter. His story provoked the mutiny of the soldiers who elected the ten military tribunes. Under their command, they headed back toward Rome and settled on the Aventine then joined with the other army on Monte Sacro. Under pressure by the soldiers and the plebeians, the decemvirs resigned. Appius Claudius Sabinus and Spurius Oppius Cornicen stayed in Rome and were imprisoned, but committed suicide before their trial.

In Book 6, chapter 23 of his Natural History, concerning the regions near the Indus River, Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 CE) wrote that \\"Beyond the mouth of the Indus are the islands of Chryse and Argyre, abounding in metals, I believe; but as to what some persons have stated, that their soil consists of gold and silver, I am not so willing to believe that.\\" Some five or six centuries later, in section XIV.vi.11 of his encyclopedic Etymologies, Isidore of Seville (c. 560‚Äì636) repeated much the same information: \\"Chryse and Argyre are islands situated in the Indian Ocean, so rich in metal that many people maintain these islands have a surface of gold and silver; whence their names are derived.\\" This was almost certainly taken‚Äîlike much else in the Etymologies, as Isidore freely admitted‚Äîdirectly from the Natural History. Both of these Latin works, the Naturalis Historia and especially the Etymologiae, were widely read in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and this ensured the survival of the legend of the Gold and Silver Islands until the beginning of the Age of Discovery. A modern facsimile of Martin Behaim's 1492 Erdapfel map. Chryse and Argyre are in the same map section as Cipangu (Japan) on the right, with Chryse just to the west of its southern tip, labelled Crisis and colored yellow-brown; Argyre is to the southwest of Chryse, labelled Argire and colored white. Note the absence of the Americas.As European geographers gathered more reliable information about the Indian Ocean, the purported location of Chryse and Argyre shifted farther and farther east to the fringes of the known world. By the time Martin Behaim created his Erdapfel globe in 1492, the islands were thought to be near Japan, possibly because Marco Polo had claimed Japan itself (which he called Cipangu) to be rich in gold and silver; Behaim is known to have used both Pliny and Marco Polo as sources. The discovery of the Americas changed everything. European explorers in search of fabled lands of gold now sailed west for El Dorado instead of east to Cipangu. The works of Isidore of Seville fell out of fashion and the islands of Chryse and Argyre slowly faded from the popular imagination. Schiaparelli's 1877 map matched with the actual surface of Mars as seen from orbit by Mariner 9. Chryse and Argyre are left of centre. In 1877, however, they were recalled to life by the astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, who used the planetary opposition of that year to begin mapping the planet Mars. As an expert in ancient astronomy and geography, he was very familiar with classical legends and fabled lands and used them to name the features he could see through the telescope. He assumed that dark areas might be low flat \\"seas\\", as they are on the Moon, while \\"land\\" would be lighter. In particular, he noted several light patches that he took to be islands; he named the most striking circular one Hellas (for Greece) and two others Chryse and Argyre. It was only with the observations made from Martian orbit by Mariner 9 in 1972 that it became clear that these light areas were not islands at all, but depressions carpeted with light windblown dust. Chryse is really a low flat plain, but the name has been kept and it is now known as Chryse Planitia, \\"Chryse Plain\\". Argyre (like Hellas) is, in fact, a broad impact crater and is now Argyre Planitia, \\"Argyre Plain\\", which in turn has given its name to one of the cartographic quadrangles of the Martian atlas.

It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2012, where it was presented out of competition. Previous adaptations of the manga series had been titled Love and Truth in English but this 2012 film version was alternatively titled For Love's Sake in English. Plot The film begins with a brief animated prologue set in 1961 in which Ai (Emi Takei), the daughter of a well-respected Tokyo family, is skiing down a snowy hill and crashes into young Makoto (Satoshi Tsumabuki). 11 years later in Tokyo in 1972, Ai is a senior in high school when Makoto shows up and is attacked by a local Tokyo gang of boys. Makoto fights them off single-handed during the film's first musical number, setting the style for the rest of the film. Ai jumps in to stop the fighting and Makoto recognizes her as the one who injured him and gave him a large scar on his forehead as a child. The police arrive and immediately recognize Ai as the daughter of a wealthy family while arresting all of the boys including Makoto, who is to be sent to a reform school. He is moments away from being attacked by a gang upon his arrival when he is informed that the Saotame family has arranged for his release and transfer to the prestigious Aobadai Prep School, where Ai is a popular student at the top of her class in academics and sports. Ai finds herself interested in Makoto and has convinced her family to sponsor him. The film follows the relationship between the delinquent Makoto and the privileged schoolgirl Ai. Iwashimizu, president of the student council, is in love with Ai. Iwashimizu shows Makoto that Ai has been breaking school rules working part-time dancing at a club and Makoto attempts to blackmail her parents for 1 million yen. They have him expelled from school and sent to Hanazono Trade School to be with his \\"own kind\\". Gum-ko and Yuki, a member and leader of a gang of girls at the trade school, become interested in Makoto.

The inscription is written on a square limestone plaque, which was probably part of a wall.Brill Online Reference Works The inscription, although bought on a market, is thought to have come from Old Kandahar, the supposed ancient Alexandria in Arachosia.

Coin of Satrap Sophytes. Sophytos and Naratos are not Greek names. They may have been Indian, their actual names being possibly Subh≈´ti and NƒÅrada. The name \\"Sophytos\\" is also known from a 4th-3rd century Greek coins of the Arachosian satrap Sophytos, who is otherwise unknown.Histoires grecques, Maurice Sartre, Le Seuil There is a possibility that the Sophytos of the inscription may have been a descendant of the eponymous Satrap Sophytos. According to the inscription, Sophytos was ruined in early life, but later rebuilt his fortune through fortitude. Some authors consider that his ruin may be due to the invasion of Arachosia by the Greco- Bactrians in the 2nd century BCE, supposing that Sophytos had been a Hellenized Indian in the service of the Arachosians region of the Maurya Empire. The usage of Greek and Aramaic is attested in the area from the 3rd century BCE due to the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription of Emperor Ashoka. The inscription highlight the facts that some Indians lived in the \\"Greek\\" city of Alexandria Arachosia, and had reached a very high level of Greek culture (only one mistake in prosody has been identified in the whole text).

Life Damien Yzerbyt was born at Mouscron or at nearby Courtrai-Kortrijk. He graduated from the Catholic (francophone) University in Louvain in 1987 with a degree in Romance Philology and Theology, and then embarked on a teaching career at the St Henry Technical academy in Mouscron, where he taught French and Religion. With a reportedly poorly prepared reallocation of responsibilities for education he was caught up in a period of some turbulence, with a series of strikes in the education sector during 1990/91. Colleagues nominated him to a new consultative-conciliation body called the Conseil d‚ÄôEntreprise (1992-2004). He involved himself in Christian associations and then moved on to politics, successfully standing for office in Mouscron in the local elections in October 1994. He was elected as a municipal councillor in 1997 and as an alderman in 2001, serving under Mayor Detremmerie, with a broad portfolio of responsibilities that covered planning and development, land use, housing, youth, mobility issues, pensions and religions. He retained his municipal responsibilities till his death in 2014. In addition, after Catherine Fonck moved on to become francophone Minister for Children, Youth and Health, on 19 July 2004 Yzerbyt took the seat that she had vacated in the national Chamber of Representatives. Less than a year later, in April 2005, he replaced Jean- Pierre Detremmerie as a deputy in the Parliament of Wallonia when the latter resigned in the context of a slow-burn controversy involving the local football club. Because of the country's constitutional structure, this also involved taking Detremmerie's place in the Brussels based Parliament of the French Community. For Yzerbyt this also meant quitting his seat in the national Chamber of Representatives after less than a year. In the Parliament of Wallonia he was a member of the Commission for Domestic Affairs and Public Officials (\\"Commission des Affaires int√©rieures et de la Fonction publique\\"). At the time of the municipal elections of October 2006, when Detremmerie let it be known that after 25 years in office he would no longer stand for election as mayor of Mouscron, he recommended as his successor Alfred Gadenne, as part of a two man team, with Yzerbyt to be the alderman responsible for finances and public works. The next election, in October 2012, the two men dominated the ballot, indicating that voters still endorsed Detremmerie's recommendations on the matter of his succession. His final years were increasingly affected by the Pancreatic cancer from which he died, a few weeks after celebrating his fiftieth birthday, at the main hospital in Mouscron at around three in the morning on 19 January 2014. In the Parliament of Wallonia the seat he had vacated was taken on by . Personal Damien Yzerbyt was married, with two recorded sons.

It is endemic to Sarawak, Borneo. Common name spiny slender toad has been coined for this little known species. Etymology The specific name echinata is derived from Latin echinatus, meaning \\"thorny\\", and refers to the spinose tubercles on top of the snout and on the sides. Distribution Ansonia echinata is endemic to Malaysian Borneo where it is only known from its type locality, Bukit Kana, a small and isolated hill in Bintulu Division, Sarawak. Description The type series consists of four adult males that measured in snout‚Äìvent length; this means that Ansonia echinata is a relatively small species among the Bornean Ansonia. The habitus is stocky. The canthus is sharp. The tympanum is visible and slightly greater than half eye in diameter. The dorsal surfaces are covered with tubercles. The snout, sides, and limbs bear tubercles with small black spines (the ones that have given the species its name). The toes are partially to fully webbed. The finger and toe tips are rounded but not expanded. The colour in life is unknown; in preservative, the dorsum is dark brown and the raised tubercles are yellowish brown. Ventral colouration is light yellowish brown without pattern. The limbs have dark crossbars. Males have subgular vocal sacs with a slit-like opening in the floor of the mouth. Female Ansonia echinata are unknown. Hertwig and colleagues discuss the possibility that Ansonia vidua, known only from two female specimens, could be conspecific with Ansonia echinata. Based on morphological and ecological differences, they conclude that the two are separate species, although lack of tissue samples from A. echinata means that this question could not be settled with molecular methods. Three kinds of Ansonia tadpoles were collected at the type locality. One of them belongs to Ansonia longidigita, whereas the other two could not be assigned to species. Because tissue samples were not available, it was not possible to ascertain which one of them, if any, belongs to Ansonia echinata. Maximum recorded total lengths of these two tadpole types tadpoles were . Habitat and ecology The type series was collected near a small stream (3 metre in width) in primary rain forest at about above sea level. All of them were perched on leaves up to 1 metre above ground. In addition, a juvenile was found in the stream itself. Otherwise, the natural history of this species is unknown.

It preserves an area of interior Atlantic Forest and cerrado, including a huge jequitib√°-rosa (Cariniana legalis) tree that by some accounts is the oldest tree in Brazil. Location The Vassununga State Park is from the city of S√£o Paulo. The park is on both sides of km 245 of the Rodovia Anhang√ºera (SP-330 highway) in the municipality of Santa Rita do Passa Quatro in the northeastern region of the State of S√£o Paulo. It has six unconnected sections: Cap√£o da V√°rzea, Capetinga Oeste, Capetinga Lesta, Praxedes, Maravilha and P√© de Gigante. It has a total area of , and protects an area of Atlantic semi-deciduous forest and cerrado forest. History The region was first developed for cattle farming, then from 1850 for coffee plantations. The landowners often maintained forest reserves to conserve soil for future plantations, preserve water sources, provide natural nurseries for coffee plants, give a source of wood for construction, maintain an area to hunt and so on. One such area was the property of the Vassununga Sugar Mill and contained the largest and most beautiful forest of jequitib√°s-rosa in the region. The sugar company went bankrupt in 1969. The Vassununga State Park was created through state decree 52.546 of 26 October 1970 to preserve this area of forest and its fauna. Environment The Vassununga State Park contains one of the last remnants of Interior Atlantic Forest in the area, with semideciduous rainforest and cerrado forest and associated fauna. There are many jequitib√°-rosa (Cariniana legalis) trees, including the largest in the state that may be visited by the public. The forest covers hills, cliffs and fluvial plains, creating a beautiful landscape of emergent forest in which the huge jequitib√°-rosa trees stand out. The park is in a highly fragmented landscape under considerable stress from human activities. There are few native ecosystems and particularly high risk of erosion near the watersheds and rivers. A strategy of connecting the fragments of the park by means of ecological corridors or stepping stones, and of ensuring sustainable use in the lands around it would be extremely useful in maintaining biodiversity. =Flora= Flora include specimens of jequitib√°-rosa (Cariniana legalis), guarit√° (Astronium graveolens), caixeta-preta (Tabebuia cassinoides), capixingui (Croton floribundus), pau-pereira (Platycyamus regnellii), copaiba, peroba-rosa (Aspidosperma polyneuron), figueira (Ficus), cedro-rosa (Cedrela fissilis), ararib√° (Centrolobium tomentosum) and paineira (Spirotheca rivieri). =Birds= Trail in the park Birds species include the yellow- headed caracara (Milvago chimachima), solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius), Amazon parrots, Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), blue ground dove (Claravis pretiosa), violaceous quail-dove (Geotrygon violacea), chestnut-bellied seed finch (Oryzoborus angolensis), hummingbirds, toucans, pionus parrots, black- throated grosbeak (Saltator fuliginosus), rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris), forpus parrots, great kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus), thraupis, woodpeckers, tataupa tinamou (Crypturellus tataupa), small-billed tinamou (Crypturellus parvirostris), partridges, seriemas, hawks and Cathartiformes. Other birds observed in the park include the rufous-tailed jacamar (Galbula ruficauda), squirrel cuckoo (Piaya cayana), southern beardless tyrannulet (Camptostoma obsoletum), purple-throated euphonia (Euphonia chlorotica), grey- headed tanager (Eucometis penicillata), barred antshrike (Thamnophilus doliatus), pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus), sepia-capped flycatcher (Leptopogon amaurocephalus), silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), planalto tyrannulet (Phyllomyias fasciatus), bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). =Mammals= Mammals include maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), cougar (Puma concolor), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), robust capuchin monkey, crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), common agouti, paca, tayra (Eira barbara) and neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis). O Patriarca The main attraction of the park is a giant jequitib√°-rosa tree in the well-preserved cerrado of the P√© de Gigante section, which takes its name from a great depression in the interior shaped like a giant's foot. The tree, called \\"O Patriarca\\" (The Patriarch), is estimated to be 600 years old based on comparison to a neighboring jequitib√° whose rings were counted and whose trunk was studied using carbon 14 dating, which gave an age of 400 years. O Patriarca is larger and has a thicker trunk, from which the age of 600 years is estimated. It is in diameter, high and has a circumference of . Its deepest root goes down to and its longest extends to the side. Its gross weight has been estimated at 264 tons. The park holds about 330 specimens of this rare and imposing tree species.

Built in 1909, it is a rare surviving example of an early company-built boarding house. It was sold into private ownership in 1924, and is a good local example of vernacular Colonial Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Sweat-Comings Company House stands in the Richford's main village, on the south side of Powell Street, a residential street just off Main Street. The house is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows in the upper floor, and sash windows flanking a pair of entrances in the center bay on the ground floor. A single-story hip-roofed porch extends across the front, with a shingled skirt and round posts. A gable rises in the roof above the central bay, with a small window at its center. The interior retains a number of original finishes, including hardwood floors, trim elements, plaster walls, and a French door in the downstairs unit. with The house was built in 1909, after a fire swept through Richford in 1907, destroying part of its downtown and the Sweat-Comings factory complex, located between Powell Street and the Missisquoi River. The factory complex was rebuilt in 1909, and this house was built next to it, on the site of a tenement house that had also been burned. According to local histories, this house was at first home to the factory's night watchman, and also served as a boarding house for single workers. It was moved in 1924 to its present location, roughly across the street from its original position. An attached garage was moved to a different location in Richford.

The Castles of Scotland. Musselburgh: Goblinshead. p. 2233 The castle was incorporated into Lainshaw House over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries. History The castle belonged to the Stewarts and served as the baronial castle of Stewarton, but in 1570 it passed to the Montgomeries. William Cunninghame, one of the tobacco lords, bought it in 1779 from Sir Walter Montgomerie-Cunninghame, 10th Laird of Lainshaw, who had been impoverished by the American War of Independence. The rear three- storey wing may have been built by Cunninghame. Inheriting the estate upon his father's death in 1799, his third son, William, began an extensive program of modernising the structure in the classical style; in 1824 a Tudor-Gothic extension was added. Structure Lainshaw Castle was described by Pont in 1608 as 'a stronge old Dunijon'. In the present structure most of the ground- floor walls and the face of the south-east wall to a height of over belong to the original castle. Two small ground-floor windows and a larger third-floor window with roll moulding are prominent among features remaining. The surviving walls have been pierced by various doorway, providing access to later structural additions, with some subsequently being blocked. Three different rooflines are may be seen on the south eastern wall face.

History Prior to 1880, the area now built upon by the Garden Suburb and an adjoining area known as Hollins Green lying under Copster Hill (now part of Copster Park) lay in Chadderton (Detached), which, as its name implies, was a detached area or exclave of Chadderton township. Boundary changes from 1880 saw the area absorbed into the town of Oldham. On 7 August 1909 the Garden Suburb, off Hollins Road, was officially opened with the first gala ceremony. The Suburbs, as they are known, grew out of the garden suburb movement of the south. The oasis of winding streets with a deliberate country lane feel, gardens, trees, and verges, was intended as an alternative to terrace houses. Garden Suburb was the idea of Mary Higgs, founder of the Beautiful Oldham Society, who was impressed by Hampstead Garden Suburb in London. Dame Sarah Lees, the philanthropist and first woman Oldham councillor, sold land near Hollins cheaply and the idea was to build 700 houses as a co-operative limited company, with rents and rates set low, to encourage working men to take them on. But by 1914, only 183 houses were let, and the tenure gradually changed from rents to ownership of around 400 homes. They were described as light and airy, well built, of artistic appearance, with a kitchen and good range, and a pantry.

She is the founder and previous CEO of SVC, Inc., a health policy consulting firm. During her tenure as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the HHS Inspector General concluded that she spent more than $5 million in federal contracts on politically connected contractors and violated federal contracting rules. More than $3.5 million of taxpayer funds were spent on consultants to promote Verma's public profile. Education Verma received a bachelor's degree in life sciences from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1993. She earned a Master of Public Health, with a concentration in health policy and management, from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in 1996. A graduate of the Richard G.

Career =Early career= Verma served as vice president of the Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County, and worked at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials in Washington, D.

She was president and CEO of the company, which has worked with state insurance agencies and public health agencies in preparation for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and assisted Indiana and Kentucky, as well as other states, in the design of Medicaid expansion programs under the ACA. In her work with Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, she developed Medicaid reform programs under the Section 1115 waiver process.Newkirk, Vann R., II (February 17, 2017). \\"Seema Verma's Austere Vision for Medicaid\\".

Verma's Trump transition portrait In 2014, concerns were raised over a potential conflict of interest arising from Verma's dual roles as both a health care consultant for Indiana and an employee of a Hewlett-Packard division that is among Indiana's largest Medicaid vendors. , SVC, Inc., had been awarded over $3.5 million in Indiana state contracts, while Verma was concurrently employed with Hewlett-Packard, earning over one million dollars during a period when the company had secured five hundred million dollars in state contracts. =Trump administration= coronavirus pandemic from the White House press briefing room on April 19, 2020 On November 29, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Verma to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees Medicare, Medicaid, and the insurance markets. On March 13, 2017, the United States Senate confirmed her nomination in a 55‚Äì43 vote. One of her first actions was to send a letter to the nation's governors, urging them to impose insurance premiums for Medicaid, charge Medicaid recipients for emergency room visits, and encourage recipients to obtain employment or job training. On July 25, 2018, Verma gave a speech in San Francisco in which she criticized proposals for \\"Medicare for all\\". She claimed that single-payer health care would \\"destroy\\" Medicare, which provides insurance for elderly people, and lead to \\"Medicare for None\\". The speech and her repeated attacks on Medicare-for-all proposals led to a lawsuit alleging that her actions violated the Hatch Act. Politico reported that Verma clashed with Acting HHS Secretary Alex Azar over which plans will replace Obamacare, and who will get credit for those efforts, according to anonymous administration officials. Reportedly, this was not the first clash Verma had with her superiors, as Politico reports that Verma hired a lawyer to file a claim of a \\"hostile work environment\\" against Secretary Tom Price. On March 2, 2020, the office of Vice President Mike Pence announced Verma's addition to White House Coronavirus Task Force. Use of taxpayer funds controversy In March 2019, Politico reported that in her role as CMS administrator, Verma approved communications subcontracts worth more than $2 million of taxpayer funds on Republican-connected communications consultants and other expenses to boost her visibility and public image. Included in the consultants' work were proposals to have Verma featured in magazines like Glamour and have her invited to prestigious events like the Kennedy honors to increase her public persona. In July 2020, the HHS Inspector General reported that Verma spent more than $5M in taxpayer funds to do communications work, and to help raise her profile. The report, a result of a 15-month investigation, concluded that Verma violated federal contracting rules: \\"CMS improperly administered the contracts and created improper employer-employee relationships between CMS and the contractors\\".\\"Top health official violated federal contracting rules, HHS inspector general finds\\", Yasmeen Abutaleb 16 July 2020, Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/16/verma-violated-contracting- rules/?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_vermacontracts-205pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory- ans&itid;=hp_hp-banner-main_vermacontracts-205pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory- ans\\"Inspector general: Medicare chief broke rules on her publicity contracts\\", Dan Diamon and Adam Cancryn, Politico, https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/16/medicare-chief-rules-publicity- contracts-365482 Verma spent more than $3.5 million on Republican Party- aligned consultants to promote her. These consultants were paid to help her write tweets and speeches, polish her profile, and broker meetings with companies and high-profile individuals (including other members of government). Verma spent nearly $3,000 on throwing a \\"Girl's Night\\" party in her honor, $13,000 to promote Verma to win awards and appear on prestigious panels. The consultants provided her with talking points on repealing the Affordable Care Act in 2017, and helped her write a 2018 opinion column under her name in the Washington Post arguing for Medicaid work requirements. One of the outside consultants that Verma paid was Marcus Barlow, who had been her spokesperson at her former consulting firm SVC. He worked on three separate contracts for the CMS, earning between $209-$230 an hour in the contracts. On August 20, 2018, Verma filed a claim requesting that taxpayers reimburse her for jewelry that was allegedly stolen on a work-related trip to San Francisco. Although she requested $47,000, including a $325 claim for moisturizer and a $5,900 Ivanka Trump-brand pendant, she ultimately received $2,852.40 in reimbursement. Personal life Born in Virginia, Verma moved several times across the United States with her family, and once lived in Taiwan for five years, before settling in the greater Indianapolis area. Verma's husband Sanjay runs a medical practice through the Indiana Health Group. The couple has two children, Maya and Shaan. As of 2017, Verma and her family live in Carmel, Indiana.

Claude d'Urf√© (1501, ch√¢teau de la Bastie d'Urf√©-1558) was a French royal official of the 16th century. He acted as governor and bailiff of Forez after that county became a royal domain. He was a friend and confidant of Francis I and fought alongside him in the Wars of Italy as well as under his son Henry II. He was also governor of the dauphin (the future Francis II) and the king's other children (the future Charles IX, Henry III, Francis, Duke of Anjou and Margaret of Valois). He was also a major patron for building works in the Italian Renaissance style in Forez, such as his Italian-style extension to his ch√¢teau of Bastie d'Urf√©. His grandson was the author Honor√© d'Urf√©.  Life  =Early life= Bastie-d'Urf√© Ch√¢teau The heir to a lordly family from Saint-√âtienne-le- Molard, Claude was the son of Pierre II d'Urf√© and Antoinette de Beauvau. According to legend, his parents had had no child after five years of marriage and monks from the monastery Pierre had founded at Auvergne had prayed that he might have a son, who arrived a few months later, leading to his nickname as \\"the miracle child\\". Orphaned at a young age (his father died when he was seven), he was raised at the French court and became a confidant of Francis I, with whom he went to war in Italy aged twenty. The king made him a squire in ordinary in 1522. In 1535 Francis made him governor general and bailiff of the county of Forez, which had been forfeited for treason by Charles III of Bourbon. He was given this title at Montbrison, its capital, in 1536 when Francis came to symbolically take possession of the county. =Royal posts= He first became France's ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire before in 1546 being sent as France's representative to the Council of Trent. He remained in post after Francis I's death in 1547 and Francis' successor Henry II made him ambassador to the Papal States. Claude intervened early in the papal conclave after pope Paul III's death in 1549 after Reginald Pole came within two votes of election during the first vote. Claude rushed to the conclave door, demanding that it wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism. This helped push the conclave into a deadlock which lasted until February the following year. Claude was then recalled to France by the king to become governor to the dauphin and his other children, succeeding Jean d'Humi√®res in this post in 1550; he shared the responsibility with the governess of the royal children, Fran√ßoise d'Humi√®res, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers.Frieda, Leonie, \\"Catherine de Medici\\", Orion Books, London, 2005 As well as the king, he advised duke Anne de Montmorency, who was godfather to Claude's grandson Anne. In 1553 Claude joined the regency council of Catherine de Medici after Henry II's death. By his death in 1558 he was also a marshal of France. = Renaissance patron = The 'salle des rocailles' in the ch√¢teau de La Bastie d'Urf√© Influenced by his friendship with Francis I (a major French Renaissance patron) and his time in Italy, Claude spread Renaissance art and design to Forez, most notably in his ch√¢teau and its chapel. His stepmother was a poet as well as a friend and confidant of Francis' sister Marguerite de Navarre, herself a poet, writer and patron of French humanists. He also interacted with court poets of the La Pl√©iade group such as Joachim du Bellay, who was one of the tutors Claude engaged whilst governor of the royal children. He also collected a large library which had reached 200 manuscripts and 4400 other volumes by the time of his death.

He was played by Nicholas Turturro from Seasons 1 to 7. Biography Martinez was originally assigned to the 15th Precinct detective squad as a temporary replacement for Andy Sipowicz after Sipowicz was shot. Though inexperienced, he demonstrated enthusiasm for the job and a willingness to learn, especially from John Kelly, whom he idolized. He proved a quick study, and his competence and upbeat approach to his job enabled him to earn a permanent assignment as a detective. He went on to work primarily as the partner of Greg Medavoy. His family life wasn't always stable; he witnessed the death of his drug addict brother to a drug overdose, for which Martinez's father blamed Martinez. Martinez pursued fellow Detective Adrienne Lesniak, who sought to avoid his romantic interests by falsely claiming to be a lesbian. They eventually did begin to date, but Lesniak's constant suspicions and criticism caused James to end their relationship. In season three, Martinez was shot in the side, bullet fragments lodged near his spine, while responding to a call with Medavoy; though doctors initially feared he'd be paralyzed, Martinez recovered and returned to work. Gina Colon, a new administrative assistant assigned to the 15th Precinct began a tentative courtship with Martinez. After Gina was beaten and her face was slashed, Martinez aided in her recovery, and their relationship blossomed. She became pregnant, but initially rebuffed Martinez's proposals because she didn't want him to feel trapped or obligated. He eventually convinced her of his sincerity, and they got married shortly before the birth of their son, James Martinez Jr. The character of James Martinez was written out of the show in Season 7; in the series, Martinez left the 15th Precinct after passing the examination for promotion and receiving a new assignment as a uniformed sergeant.

Furthermore, he is the founder of the clothing label Pusher Apparel and the co-founder of Suckit.  Career  = Youth = Elvir Omerbegovic was born in Mettmann, Germany in 1979 as the son of Bosnian parents. At the age of twelve, Omerbegovic began to play streetball and won the German championship with his team several times. From 1993 onwards, he performed his sport semi- professionally, playing for Bayer Giants Leverkusen and Brandt Hagen. At the age of 16, he competed against AAU teams in New York as a member of a selected squad. Prior to finishing High School in Germany, he also played basketball at a High School in Kentucky, USA for one season. Upon graduation, Omerbegovic worked for RTL Newmedia in Cologne, Germany. He then earned a bachelor's degree in Political Science, Media and Sociology. Subsequently, he received a master's degree in Political communication.Elvir Omerbegovic ‚Äì Aufstieg aus eigener Kraft (2015). In: ‚ÄöSelfmade Records‚Äò ‚Äì Die ersten 10 Jahre des erfolgreichsten deutschen HipHop-Labels, 20‚Äì31 In 1999, he met Philipp Dammann during a community service training in Herdecke, Germany. Dammann, alias Flipstar, was a member of the Hip Hop group Creutzfeld & Jakob. Omerbegovic then began to appear as a rapper under the artist name Slick One. Flipstar also provided Omerbegovic with initial contacts in the German Hip Hop scene.Die Anf√§nge von ‚ÄöSelfmade Records' ‚Äì Eine Oral History (2015). In: ‚ÄöSelfmade Records‚Äò ‚Äì Die ersten 10 Jahre des erfolgreichsten deutschen HipHop- Labels, 11‚Äì18 In 2003, Omerbegovic was featured in the song Game Over for the first time on the Creutzfeld & Jakob album Zwei Mann gegen den Rest. In 2005, Omerbegovic recorded some songs in collaboration with Flipstar. Wo ich herkomm was used as one of the tracks for the Sampler Schwarzes Gold. Within the next two years, he recorded contributions to five releases by Selfmade Records. On the track Bruderkrieg, a collaboration with Edo Maajka on the album Chronik 2 in 2009, Omerbegovic appeared as a rapper for the last time. = Business activities =  Sefmade records  Frank Briegmann and Elvir Omerbegovic (2014) Thomas Burkholz, Kollegah, Elvir Omerbegovic and Markus Huber at the gold record certification of \\"Zuh√§ltertape Volume 4\\" After the cancellation of the contract between Universal Music and the duo Creutzfeld & Jakob in 2005, Omerbegovic moved from Cologne to the city of Bochum, Germany to establish a music label with Philipp Dammann under the name Selfmade Records. Initially, the label was only supposed to serve as a platform for Dammann's releases as Flipstar, as well as for other Hip Hop acts in the region. Following a short- term cooperation with Jan Mehlhose from the Sublabel Subword, Omerbegovic arranged a distribution agreement with Groove Attack. At this point, producer Rizbo and Rapper Favorite from the city of Essen had already been contracted as the label's first artists. In April 2005, the sampler Schwarzes Gold was released as the first Selfmade Records production. Over the course of the year, Shiml and Kollegah also received contracts as artists. With respect to his selection of Rappers, Omerbegovic explained that it was his \\"intention to sign and develop artists who [‚Ä¶] have outstanding technical skills and brought something entirely new to the German Hip Hop scene.\\" At the end of 2005, Dammann left the music label and Omerbegovic took over single-handedly. Due to its infrastructural advantages, he relocated the Selfmade Records headquarters to D√ºsseldorf in 2007. In addition to his work as label manager, Omerbegovic also took over the positions of product and tour manager. In addition, he helped with the production of the releases, \\"subtly influencing the albums\\" by suggesting the modification of sounds, lyrics or selected verses. In 2007, Alphagene by Kollegah was the label's first album to enter the German charts. In the following two years, the label achieved similar successes with Favorite and Shiml. In 2009, another Rapper by the name of Casper was signed. Selfmade Records presented Casper as part of the sampler Chronik 2. In the following months, the contractual collaboration with Shiml and Casper was terminated. At the end of 2011 and at the beginning of 2012, the Hip Hop groups Genetikk and 257ers were presented as new additions to the label, respectively. The release of the album Jung, brutal, gutaussehend 2 by Kollegah and Farid Bang in 2013 marked the first time a Selfmade Records album entered the charts at the number one spot. After the album went Gold, Universal Music contacted Omerbegovic to discuss a potential collaboration. Omerbegovic initially refused the offer and instead extended the distribution agreement with Groove Attack. After another successful release, namely Genetikk's album D.N.A., various labels approached Selfmade Records. In early 2014, a joint venture with Universal Music was finally announced. According to Omerbegovic, the advantage of this cooperation lies in the ability to \\"operate with the speed of an indie label and the power of a major label.\\" His major label counterpart was Frank Briegmann, President Central Europe of Universal Music Group International, as well as the Deutsche Grammophon. By means of the contract with Universal Music, Omerbegovic received the position of President of Rap Selfmade Records and Universal Music Germany. The label's next releases, i.e. King, Boomshakkalakka, Neues von Gott, Achter Tag and Zuh√§ltertape Volume 4 all ranked number one in the German charts as well. In the summer of 2014, Rapper Karate Andi was signed as an artist. At the end of 2015, Selfmade Records presented Karate Andi to a larger audience through his appearances on the sampler Chronik 3. Like the previous albums, the sampler also rose to the top of the charts. Omerbegovic used the release of Chronik 3 for a review of the ten-year history of his record label. He appeared as the editor of the book Selfmade Records ‚Äì Die ersten 10 Jahre des erfolgreichsten HipHop-Labels.

That same year, the new fashion label's products were integrated in the marketing efforts of the album Jung, brutal, gutaussehend, with Rappers Kollegah and Farid Bang presenting the label's products in their music videos, press photos and on pictures in the album's booklet. Pusher Apparel is part of the network of the Bravado Merchandise GmbH, a sub-company of Universal Music Group, and it is run by Frank Briegmann. The label's product line primarily targets sporty male clients between thirteen and 28 years of age.

Suckit specializes in the production of alcoholic water ice (freeze-pops). Shortly after sales started through the company's website in April 2014, Suckit was able to sell 30,000 units of its products. By now, the product is present on the shelves of numerous supermarkets. According to Suckit, 750,000 units of ice were sold in the first two-year, of which 500,00 in 2015. In 2016, 1.4 million units were sold. In October 2016, the company was featured in the show Die H√∂hle der L√∂wen. However, the investors involved refrained from acquiring business shares. So far, MoTrip, Marteria, Farid Bang, KC Rebel, Schwesta Ewa, 257ers, Favorite, Joko Winterscheidt, Klaas Heufer-Umlauf and Micaela Sch√§fer had appearances with the product.

It had its origins in the failed Venezuelan airline of the same name. Founded in 2015, LaMia operated three Avro RJ85 aircraft as of November 2016. The airline received international attention when one of its aircraft crashed in November 2016, killing many members of Brazilian football club Chapecoense. In the aftermath, LaMia's air operator's certificate was suspended by the Bolivian civil aviation authority. History =LaMia (Venezuela)= Bolivian airline LaMia originated in the failed Venezuelan airline of the same name, which was founded as LAMIA, C.A. in 2009 by Spanish businessman Ricardo Albacete. The name chosen, styled as , was the acronym of L√≠nea A√©rea M√©rida Internacional de Aviaci√≥n. It took delivery of an ATR 72 wet leased from Swiftair and intended to begin service out of M√©rida, Venezuela, its original base. However, the company failed to secure its own air operator's certificate and folded in October 2010 after only operating since August, with Swiftair taking back the aircraft. After its permits expired, LaMia attempted a relaunch in 2011 by taking a single Avro RJ85 and focusing on domestic flights, although none operated from M√©rida. Having had its efforts in M√©rida thwarted twice, the airline moved to the state of Nueva Esparta: the airline changed the M in its name to mean Margarita and planned to relaunch in early 2014 operating out of Porlamar. A November 2013 demonstration flight featured the state's governor, Carlos Mata Figueroa, and Albacete gave a speech praising Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro; this incarnation also fell through amidst the country's worsening economic crisis. In 2014, LaMia even placed its planes in Trujillo, Trujillo, apparently with the intent of operating flights from Valera to Caracas, but these efforts never got off the ground; the airline failed to receive certification from the National Institute of Civil Aviation (INAC), and the planes were only in Venezuela for a year. =LaMia (Bolivia)= With their repeated failures in two Venezuelan states, the Venezuelan owners opted to lease the three RJ85s they had to Bolivian entrepreneurs; in a cost-cutting move, the Bolivian company adopted the name already painted on the aircraft: LaMia. The two aircraft not in service at the time of the crash still bore the Venezuelan airline's website, lamia.com.ve, on their sides. In November 2015, Bolivian airline LaMia‚Äîa legally distinct company incorporated as LAMIA Corporation SRL‚Äîset up offices in a house in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and received permission from its national civil aviation authority to begin offering domestic charter flights there; such operations began in January 2016 under the new company's \\"indefinite\\" operating certificate. Its fleet included three RJ85 aircraft with capacity for 95 passengers, though two never flew and the airline never offered commercial service. At the time, operations coordinator Mario Pacheco said that resource extraction and mining companies, travel agencies and soccer teams were among their target clients. Indeed, soccer teams were among the most faithful clients, and the airline had flown the Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela national teams as well as the Colombian Atl√©tico Nacional, the Paraguayan Club Olimpia and local sides Oriente Petrolero, The Strongest and Club Blooming. Additionally, the Bolivian Ministry of Mining and Metallurgy was a client of the airline. In the aftermath of the crash of Flight 2933, DGAC, Bolivia's aviation authority, suspended LaMia's operating license, and the Bolivian Labor Ministry stated that LaMia was not a registered business with the government. Bolivian law requires all employers to be registered with the Labor Ministry, which maintains the Obligatory Registry of Businesses. Corporate affairs LaMia was headquartered in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. It was owned by Gustavo Vargas Gamboa; its other owner, Miguel Alejandro Quiroga Murakami, died in the Flight 2933 accident. As of 30 November 2016, the airline had eight employees. Albacete, the owner of the Venezuelan airline that owns the Bolivian airline's fleet, told press from Spain that while he was emotionally affected by the disaster, he was not involved in the Bolivian airline's operations. On 6 December, Vargas Gamboa was arrested along with two other LaMia employees by the local branch of the attorney general's office. He claimed that he had presented his resignation from the company three days before the crash, on 25 November. That same day, the civil aviation authority hauled documents and papers from the airline's Santa Cruz headquarters. The other owner, Miguel Quiroga, had an arrest warrant issued by the Bolivian government for leaving the Bolivian Air Force earlier than had been stipulated, breaking the terms of his pilot training. The Air Force found that Quiroga and four other trained pilots had not provided sufficient justification for leaving before they had completed their required years of military service. In May 2017, a CNN report revealed that LaMia's insurance policy with Bolivian insurer Bisa had lapsed beginning in October 2016 for nonpayment; while said policy did not cover flights to Colombia, which the insurer included as part of a geographical exclusion clause along with several African countries, as well as Peru, Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, the airline managed to get permission to fly to Colombia on at least eight occasions. Fleet A LaMia Avro RJ85 registered P4-LOR at Glasgow Airport in 2013, operating for the Venezuelan LaMia. The aircraft was re-registered as CP-2933 in 2015 and was destroyed in the Flight 2933 accident. As of 30 November 2016, after the destruction of CP-2933, the remaining LaMia fleet consisted of two 95 passenger Avro RJ85 aircraft. The multinational investigative commission opted on 7 December to seize the other two aircraft as part of its investigation. The Bolivian Air Force also revealed that it had filed a lawsuit for maintenance on the downed aircraft carried out by the Air Force in 2014, but for which the airline never paid. Accidents and incidents =Flight 2933= On the night of 28 November 2016 at approximately 10:33 pm (Bogot√° time), LaMia Flight 2933, which carried 77 passengers mostly composed of Brazilian football squad Chapecoense, departed Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Bolivia) heading towards Medell√≠n (Colombia) when the aircraft crashed in the countryside just outside La Uni√≥n in Antioqu√≠a department. Out of the 77 passengers, 71 were officially confirmed dead. Miguel Quiroga, one of the flight crew of the downed aircraft, was also a part owner of the airline. The crash exposed gaps in safety at the airline. LaMia did not meet IATA regulations that would have permitted it to handle the aftermath of the crash; instead, the airline had to borrow 100 coffins, requiring Avianca, the Colombian flag carrier, and the Colombian and Brazilian governments to step in and pick up the slack. The Bolivian government proceeded to suspend LaMia's license on 1 December.

History The first issue of Al Liamm was published in 1946. The initial magazine was created in Paris by P√™r ar Bihan and Andrev Latimier, and then merged with two other cultural magazines, Kened, and then T√≠r na n√ìg, in 1948. Ronan Huon, who was, along with Pol Le Gourrierec, the editor of T√≠r na n√ìg, took charge of the fusion. He directed the resulting magazine, Al Liamm-Tir na n√ìg, for about half a century. One of his sons, Tudual Huon, has taken his place at the head of the magazine. In 2013, the magazine had 600 subscribers and a circulation of 700. Profile Every issue offers a selection of short stories, poetry and literary essays entirely in Breton. Numerous authors of modern Breton literature, such as Abeozen, Per Denez, Youenn Drezen, Xavier de Langlais (Langleiz), Anjela Duval, Reun Ar C'halan, Maodez Glanndour, Youenn Gwernig, Roparz Hemon, Ronan Huon, Paol Keineg, Kerverzio√π, Meavenn, Youenn Olier, and Yann-Ber Piriou have made contributions to the magazine with poems, short stories, essays, and studies. Breton poets and singers who were directly involved in the revival of the music of Brittany, such as Milig ar Ska√±v (Glenmor), Youenn Gwernig, or Bernez Tangi, have also published poems and songs in Al Liamm. As emphasised by Welsh author and editor Meic Stephens, Al Liamm is \\"the principal platform for just about every Breton writer of note to emerge during the post-war period\\". Poems from Al Liamm authors have often been put to music and songs by Breton singers, such as V√©ronique Autret, Nolwenn Leroy, Yann-Fa√±ch Kemener, Gilles Servat and Alan Stivell. The close relationships between modern celtic nations and the various branches of celtic literature have also led to contributions from Welsh and Irish authors, and to Breton translations from Welsh literature and Gaelic literature (Thomas Gwynn Jones, Sorley MacLean, Se√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in, and Kate Roberts).

P.M.Rocca Biography He was born from a quite rich family in Alcamo, in the province of Trapani; after he had finished his studies among the Jesuits, he entered the episcopal seminary of Mazara del Vallo, but as he had no inclination for an ecclesiastical career, he left this seminary and followed his studies independently. Since his youth, however, he committed himself in the social field and for the public good. In 1863 they founded the first Conference of Saint Vincent de Paul in Alcamo, and in 1871 Pietro Maria Rocca promoted the institution of a boarding school of little artisans for the sustenance and education of young boys coming from poor families at the ex Convent of Saint Francis. In spite of all its appreciations, the boarding school was closed after a little time due to financial problems.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.201-202, Alcamo, ed. In 1877 inside the Ex Church of Saint James of the Sword they had collected all the books from the convents suppressed by government, and Rocca made himself available for the cataloguing of those books, so originating the Civic Library in Alcamo. In 1881 he was admitted to the Societ√† Siciliana per la Storia Patria and in 1884 he became a municipal councillor: he proposed the realization of a raised floor in the Ex Church of Saint James in order to protect from humidity the books and the notarial deeds he had collected. He also gathered some finds, such as oil lamps and stamps of bent tiles of the Roman age, and later entrusted them to the National Archaeological Museum of Palermo, where they can currently be seen.Gli studi di archeologia (PDF), drepanon.org. In 1893, he was appointed as president of the local hospital and he also had the office of Fine Arts Inspector. During all his life he was keen on the history and monuments of his town, publishing tens of books for which he received several favourable approvals and statements of merit.Andrea Chiarelli, Dario Cocchiara, Alcamo nel XX secolo volume I, Alcamo, Campo, 2005.

The building continues to serve its original purpose, now called the Woodbury Elementary School, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Woodbury Graded School is located on the western fringe of Woodbury's small village center, on the south side of Valley Lake Road. It is a two-story wood frame building, with a hip roof and exterior of wooden shingles and clapboards. The roof has an eave with exposed rafter ends, two large chimneys rising from the long ends, and a hip roofed dormer at the center of the long side. The main entrance, centered on the long side, is sheltered by a broad gable-roofed hood, supported by plain triangular brackets; its gable and eave have similar exposed rafter ends. The entry area includes a main entrance halfway between the basement and first floor levels, with a handicap ramp rising on the right side to a second entrance at the first floor. It has bands of sash windows, a characteristic of period schools mandated by state standards. with The school was built in 1919, as part of the town's efforts to consolidate its district schools, and to handle an influx of students after the area's economy boomed because of its successful granite quarries. The building has continued to serve as the town's primary school since its construction, and presently serves grades K-6.

An influential teacher, his students, such as Bourdieu, have noted Weil's formative role in their intellectual development.Bourdieu, Pierre, In Other Words, Essays Towards a Reflexive Sociology, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990. p. 3-4. This influence was also at the origin of the creation of the Institut √âric Weil, a foundation and research library created by a group of his former students after his death. A systematic thinker, Weil's works follow Kant's divide between practical and theoretical philosophy, a complete statement of his thought is developed in his Logique de la philosophie (1950), Philosophie politique (1956), and Philosophie morale (1961). These books show how the effort to understand violence by subsuming it under a discursive form is the basis of philosophical reflection. Because there are always novel forms of violence that grow out of older already understood and subsumed forms of violence, Weil insists on the role of history in philosophical discourse.Roth, Michael S., Knowing and History: Appropriations of Hegel in Twentieth Century France, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988. The role of history is seen in Weil's political thought, for instance, where he rejects the contractualist notion of an original position and instead underlines the historic, context specific, and often violent, origin of political formations, usual by territory-grabbing military leaders.Weil, √âric, Philosophie politique, Paris: Vrin, 1956. This historical origin is used to explain how cultural and political traditions are often inhabited by antique forms of violence that can resurge at any moment or can have perverting effects on the formation of political identity.  Early life and education  Weil was born June 8, 1904 in the town of Parchim in the State of Mecklenburg in Germany, to Louis and Ida (n√©e L√∂wenstein) Weil. The Weils were a well-to-do Jewish family. He spent his entire childhood in Parchim where he was first a student at the Parchim Vorschule and then at the Freidrich-Franz-Gymnasium. He finished his studies at the Gymnasium in the spring of 1922 and left Parchim to go to Medical School in Hamburg. Just after Weil matriculated into university, his father died. Louis Weil's death led the family into material difficulties that would persist all throughout √âric Weil's student years. During Weil's medical studies his interest in philosophy was already evident: his university registration from 1922 includes one of Ernst Cassirer's courses on Philosophy of Language. The following year Weil would move to Berlin while still continuing his studies in Medicine. Over the next decade, Weil, now studying philosophy full-time, would move back and forth between Hamburg and Berlin numerous times. Between Hamburg and Berlin, Weil started his doctoral studies and eventually wrote his dissertation \\"Des Pietro Pomponazzi Lehre von dem Menschen und der Welt\\" under Cassirer. It is during this period that he started to publish reviews and articles, as well as work as a private tutor. It was also during this period that he started an association with the circle around Aby Warburg and the Warburg Library. Moving again back to Berlin from Hamburg in 1930, Weil became the personal secretary to the philosopher Max Dessoir, and became involved in the publication of his journal Zeitschrift f√ºr √Ñsthetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft. In 1932 Weil published his doctoral dissertation. During this tumultuous period Weil read Mein Kampf and understanding the political implications on him as a Jew, he started looking towards his options abroad. He notably applied for a position at the University of Puerto Rico, which he did not receive.  Flight from Germany  In April 1933, Weil moved to Paris. It was during this period that he started to see Anne Mendelsohn, the childhood best friend of Hannah Arendt and herself a German immigrant of Jewish extraction. Weil's early years in France were tumultuous; he moved frequently and was often short of money. But despite this, it was during this period that he and Anne married, first in a civil ceremony in Paris on the 16th of October 1934 and then in a religious ceremony in Luxembourg a week later. Luxembourg was to be the point of interaction between Weil and his relatives, because after leaving Germany in 1933 he refused to return for many years. During this period, despite the instability, Weil started to integrate into French intellectual life in Paris. He naturalized as a French citizen and continued to pursue his work on Renaissance humanism. He produced his study \\"Ficin et Plotin\\" around the Neoplatonism of Marsilio Ficino and his attempts, through the work of Plotinus, to fuse Platonism and Christianity.Weil, √âric, Ficin et Plotin, edited by Alain Deligne, Paris: L'Harmattan, 2007. This work would remain unpublished until 2007. Around this time, he started the work that would culminate in the Logique de la philosophie as a reflection around the role that philosophical categories and discursive rationality play in history. His association with Alexandre Koyr√©, to whom the Logique de la philosophie was dedicated, also started during this period, collaborating with him on the journal Recherches Philosophiques from 1934 to 1938. He participated in Koyr√©'s seminar on the Phenemonology of Spirit, continuing when it was taken over by Alexandre Koj√®ve. Koyr√© was also to be the director of the work that he defended at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes \\"La critique de l'astrologie chez Pic de la Mirandole\\" which extended his work on the Renaissance, in order to have an equivalence degree in France. The events at the end 1930's uprooted the lives of those around Weil. His mother was forced to sell the family home in Parchim. The home of his sister Ruth and his brother-in-law Dr. Siegfried Cohn was ransacked and Siegfried was arrested. The following year, in 1939, the Cohns sent their daughters to the Netherlands to be hidden. Only Siegfried and the girls would survive the war, organizing transport to Australia.  War years  The Second World War was to have, like for so many of his generation, a profound effect on Weil. This was not only because he was a German Jew, and so felt more deeply than gentile Europe the initial, and final, pressures of the Hitlerian regime, but also because this war provides and clear picture of Weil's philosophical, political, and human commitments. A shift had already happened in his thinking before the war. This fecund period in Paris marks the beginning of the reflection that was to become the Logique de la philosophie. Weil started to work out his theory about how fundamental philosophical concepts come to organize and structure the world. In this work Weil sets up a fundamental antinomy between liberty and violence, and shows how discursive rationality is the result of the interplay between these two forces. This is because, for Weil, discursive rationality is the product of the overcoming of violence by the interpretation of it under the logical form of contradiction.Canivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998 In a way, Weil's whole project can be understood as trying to understand attribution of meaningful content, whether it be to actions, propositions, or feelings, and how that meaning can be used as a resource to help individuals overcome violence. This however was not merely a theoretical engagement. At the start of the war Weil took a fake name, Henri Dubois, and enlisted in the French army and go to the front to combat the Nazi regime. In June 1939, 6 months after his enlistment Weil, as Henri Dubois, was taken prisoner and interned at Fallingsbostel. There he became an organizer of the prison resistance and wrote for its clandestine newspaper. He was to spend the rest of the war interned as a German prisoner. It was not until 1945, when the camp was liberated that Weil was able to return to Paris.  Academic career  Returning to Paris, Weil almost immediately secured a post as a researcher at CNRS, and within the year he was able to finish writing the Logique de la philosophie. It was also during this period that Weil reformed his relationship with Georges Bataille, who he had met years before in the Hegel seminars. This relationship continued after the formation Critique, and led to Weil's involvement with the journal. During this period he defended a doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne using the Logique de la philosophie as well as the slender Hegel and the State as the texts. His jury consisted of Jean Wahl, Henri Gouhier, Jean Hyppolite, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Edmond Vermeil. Over the next several years Weil would be active in Parisian philosophical and intellectual circles, organizing numerous conferences, participating in seminars, writing articles. It was also during this period that Weil started teaching, notably as an instructor at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes. He was able to secure entrance into French higher education as a Ma√Ætre de Conf√©rences (Junior Professor) and found his first permanent post at the University of Lille. At 52, Weil finally had the security of a regular position. Over the next several decades, Weil would publish the two other major books completing his system, Philosophie politique, and Philosophie morale. In addition he would publish a book dealing with Kant, Probl√®mes Kantiens, and at the urging of his students two collections of his articles and shorter works, Essais et Conf√©rences I (1970) and II (1971). During this time his position as a recognized public intellectual grew, as he published in international journals, gave numerous international conferences, and was a visiting professor in the United States. In 1968, after 12 years in Lille, Weil took a position at the University of Nice and he and his wife moved to the south of France. Weil was to be active up until his death, giving a final conference on Hegel just months before his death on February 1, 1977 at his home in Nice.  Recognition  During his lifetime Weil was both a widely known and widely recognized public intellectual. He was one of the philosophers chosen to participate in the UNESCO Symposium on Democracy, alongside the likes of John Dewey, Henri Lefebvre, C. I. Lewis, Richard McKeon and others.McKeon Richard ed., Democracy in a World of Tensions, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951. He also participated in the famous colloquium at Royaumont that would be one of the first encounters between the newly self-consciously analytic and continental philosophical schools. Present at this meeting were such luminaries as P. F. Strawson, Chaim Perelman, J. L. Austin, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, W. V. Quine, and Jean Wahl among others.Cahiers de Royaumont, La Philosophie Analytique, Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1990. In addition to his selection among such thinkers, Weil was also honored with a variety of distinguished awards. In 1965 he was named a chevalier of the French L√©gion d'Honneur, in 1969 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of M√ºnster. In 1970 he was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1975 he was elected a member of the French Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques de l'Institut de France. Other honors include numerous tributes and special editions of reviews and journals celebrating his work.  Philosophical work  Analyses of Weil's work often split his practical philosophy and his theoretical philosophy.Cf. for example the two part critical study of Weil's work by Francis Guibal, who clearly follows this divide. Guibal, Francis, Le Courage de la raison: La philosophie pratique d'√âric Weil and Le Sens de la r√©alit√©: Logique et existence selon √âric Weil. Paris: Le Felin, 2009 and 2011. Following this traditional distinction largely inherited from Kant, we see the fullest expression of his theoretical philosophy in his Logique de la philosophie, and that of his practical philosophy in his Philosophie politique, and Philosophie morale. This distinction however is deceptive, because as is seen in all of these works and also in his numerous articles and critical studies, the distinction seems much less clear, and these two sides of his philosophical project mutually inform each other and work in unison. Nonetheless, there are significant distinctions between the two sides of Weil's philosophy.Kirscher, Gilbert, √âric Weil ou la raison de la philosophie, Lille: Presses Universitiares du Septentrion. p.43 = The Logic of Philosophy = Weil's first major publication, as well as the work that treats the most thoroughly the theoretical aspect of Weil's philosophy, is the Logique de la philosophie. This work centers on how different philosophical discourses are articulated and how concepts acquire meaningful content. Through the progressive analysis of different types of philosophical discourses, this work also attempts to account for the possibility of understanding itself. In addition he shows how the concepts around which coherent discourse can be organized and the content that they articulate are irreducible, and that this content, under the name of categories, can be understood as the guiding concepts that organize human life and activity. Under these categories, coherent discourse can be understood as a \\"comprehensive grasp\\" of the real, which itself is born out of what Weil refers to as attitudes, otherwise understood as a specific normative stance in the individual's existence. Attitudes and categories both have specific relationship to meaning. The attitude is the \\"lived meaning\\" both in the invention of the meaning of a \\"form of life\\" as well as in its opposition to other forms of life themselves understood as attitudes. On the other hand, the category is this lived meaning taken now in the form of a concept, that is in a coherent discourse. Weil presents these philosophical discourses as being historically formed responses to the problem of violence.Perine, Marcelo, Philosophie et violence: Sens et intention de la philosophie d'√âric Weil, Paris: Beauchesne 1991. In the introduction to the Logique, Weil insists that any start to the project of philosophy is arbitrary, because nothing is proved and \\"nothing is established\\".Weil, √âric, Logique de la philosophie, Paris: Vrin, 1950. p. 89 Weil uses this contingency to present one of his major theses, and one of the concerns that runs throughout his philosophical work, the role of liberty understood as a choice between violence and discourse, or said otherwise, violence and meaning, or violence and reasonable action, all of which come back to being the same thing. The reason for this is that Weil's work does not overlook the possibility of violence as an absolute refusal of meaning, that is, as a refusal of discourse understood as reasonable action and justification through arguments. However, Weil does not limit his analysis of violence to this absolute refusal. His work also thematizes the violence that wants to impose meaning, wants to be the creation of meaning. In this way he shows how meaning can be more or less reasonable, as for instance the myth Hitlerian of a superior race. This reflection highlights the importance that Weil places on the criteria of universalizability, that is, to understand the meaning of meaning, whereby meaning is structured in a discourse that attempts to seize reality in its entirety and to give rational beings a domain of reasonable action. The structure of the Logique is integral to the understanding of the text itself. Weil initially wrote the body of the text, that is, the exposition of categories, and then went back and wrote a long introduction that makes up nearly a quarter of the text.Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 19 The introduction is itself an interpretative gesture of the work that follows it. One of the difficulties of understanding the Logique specifically, more so than Weil's other works, is that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what Weil's own position is. Even from the start, in the introduction, Weil presents a protean view of philosophical discourse. One of the reasons for this is that according to Gilbert Kirscher, other philosophies concern themselves with trying to give positive theories of Being or of the Object or the Subject whereas the philosophical project of Weil is not interested in establishing an ontology or a metaphysics or even an anthropology, but is rather concerned with the \\"possibility of any thematization to come\\".Kirscher, Gilbert, La philosophie d'√âric Weil, Paris: PUF. p. 48 In the introduction itself starts this multiform gesture whereby Weil gives a plurality of positions from which to view the project. In fact pluralism is one of the most important aspects of the philosophical effort of Weil.Dillens, Anne-Marie, Le Pluralism des valeurs entre particulier et universel, Brussels: Les Presses de l'Universit√© Saint Louis, 2004. Since he understands philosophy as a project that an individual comes to in medias res their sole resource in order to start the project is the scraps and fragments of previous philosophical discourses that persist in their historical tradition. This position shows two aspects of the thrust of the Logique. On the one hand, these fragments that are left over in the tradition shows the target of philosophical discourse, which is an attempt to seize reality as it is lived as a coherent whole, on the other hand it shows the insufficiency of past attempts at universalization. This search for coherency, and the drive towards the universalization of meaning by the elimination of incoherencies highlights the way that Weil thematizes violence. To seize reality as it is lived as a coherent whole means that even those things that resist thematization must find a place within the discourse, this includes violence. Weil notes \\"it is language that brings out violence. Man, speaking being, or if we prefer, thinking being ‚Äì is the sole to reveal violence, because he is the sole to look for a meaning, to invent, to create a meaning to his life and to his world, a meaning to his life in an organized and understandable world, a world organized and understandable through reference to his life, as the country of the meaning of his life\\".Weil, √âric \\"Violence et Langage\\" in Cahiers √âric Weil I, Lille: Presses Universitaires de Lille, 1987. In this sense, in order to be able to seize violence in discourse, and to subsume it in order to overcome it, violence must take on a discursive form. For Weil, violence is brought into discourse by giving it the logical form of contradiction. In this way, the irreducible philosophical categories that have at one point ordered and structured human understanding are discourses that have also arrived at overcoming pure violence for a time and have defined a specific notion of contradiction that has helped organize human society and understanding. However, as these discursive forms have been unable to achieve absolute coherence, new forms of discourse are elaborated that ask questions that the dominant discourse is unequipped to answer or even to recognize as valid.Weil, √âric, Logique de la philosophie, Paris: Vrin, 1950. p. 55-86 Therefore, the introduction to the Logique, which presents the critical project, does so by taking on a diversity of viewpoints and examining different possibilities in order to situate the rest of the text in a philosophical continuity. Part of this effort is to show how specific philosophical discourses have come about, and the historicity of its own elaboration. In this way, Weil leans on a sociology and on an anthropology that the non-specialist would recognize specifically because it is built around definitions that have endured in the tradition. In order to start, many concepts, such as the notion of desire and satisfaction, or of reason and violence, are initially taken as unproblematic. However, the entire introduction is a sustained effort to highlight the difficulty of the project of definition and how the attribution of conceptual content is itself a problematic endeavor, and centers the body of the text's theme on discourse. The rest of the text is broken into 18 chapters each corresponding to the 18 philosophical categories that are elaborated. The categories are: Truth, Nonsense, The True and the False, Certainty, Discussion, The Object, The Self, God, Condition, Conscience, Intelligence, Personality, The Absolute, The Oeuvre, The Finite, Action, Meaning, and finally, Wisdom. These categories correspond to historic philosophical discourses that have been elaborated, however their logical order is something that appears a posteriori and something that does not have a direct correspondence with the historic appearance of these discourse.Canivez, Patrice, \\"La notion de reprise et ses applications\\", in Cultura, Vol. 31, 2013, pp. 15-29. Each category has a tripartite structure. There is the category itself, which is the discursive elaboration of a concrete content, and there is also the attitude, which can be seen as the source of categories, which is the pre-discursive normatively implicit ground for the content of the category as lived practices. Finally there is the reprise, which has been called \\"the most important concept from the Logique\\",Canivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998. p. 51 and roughly sketched is the way that the content of an attitude or of a category is taken up and expressed in the language of another attitude or category.  Categories  Within the tripartite division on how conceptual content is attributed in attitudes, categories, and reprises Weil makes other important distinctions. In a long footnote in the Logique Weil makes an initial important distinction between categories: ::Metaphysical categories: that is, the categories developed by metaphysics for use by particular sciences. It is these that we ordinarily have in mind when we speak of categories: from Aristotle (if not Plato) until Hegel and beyond, we understand, as categories, the fundamental concepts determining the questions according to which it is necessary to consider or analyze or question everything that is in order to know that it is so. They are metaphysical in this sense, that only the first science, that of Being as such can provide them; but they are essentially scientific in their use; said otherwise: elaborated by metaphysics, they don't guide it. In order to found his ontology, Aristotle doesn't use the concepts of essence, of attribute, of place, etc.; he uses the principle according to which reasoning can't go on infinitely ‚Äî a principle that isn't founded on ontology and its categories, but which allows the conception of an original science. Kant doesn't build his transcendental ontology with the help of his table of categories but the help of the \\"ideas\\" of liberty and eternity, of the transcendental ideal, of the kingdom of ends. Hegel himself recognizes the difference between the Logic of Being (that of metaphysical categories), that of the Essence and that of Reality, the last of which must, among other things, make the meaning of the first part of the entire logic, starting, from the metaphysical categories, understood. It is essential that the two senses of the word be clearly distinguished in the whole course of this work, which is only interested in metaphysical categories to the extent that they reveal the philosophical categories, these centers of discourse starting from which an attitude expresses itself in a coherent fashion (or, in the case of categories refusing all discourse, can be grasped by philosophy's discourse).Weil, √âric, Logique de la philosophie, Paris: Vrin, 1950. p. 146-47 Metaphysical categories can in this way be understood as meta-scientific or often as pre-scientific as they are attempts at grasping reality and at organizing scientific activity, however metaphysical categories claim nonetheless to create a correspondence between what they describe and how reality is.Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 35 However, \\"Weil for his part rigorously abandons, in starting by truth, any representative, epistemological, ontological aims\\".Kirscher, Gilbert, La philosophie d'√âric Weil, Paris: PUF. p. 54. Weil's interest in this work is philosophical categories, which are \\"constitutive of the philosophical discourse as an absolutely coherent discourse\\". In this way, all the categories until The Absolute thematize the different manners that philosophical discourses have attempted to grasp reality in its entirety by placing meaning outside of the discursive act and making it correspond to some way that the world really is in itself. For this reason Weil calls The Absolute \\"the first category of philosophy‚Ä¶ [and] in the category of philosophy, it is not only a matter of thinking, nor of thinking the thought, but of thinking the thinking\\".Weil, √âric, Logique de la philosophie, Paris: Vrin, 1950. p. 341. This passage is revealing of Weil's understanding of his categorical project, because the passage to The Absolute unfetters Weil's project from attempting to link or correspond philosophical categories to Being, or the One, or substance, but instead ties it to the semantic project of meaning. In this way the philosophical categories, \\"no longer target the creation of philosophy as a science, they define a certain relationship to philosophizing, that is, to discourse and to the coherence of discourse\\".Canivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998. p. 51. The absolutely coherent discourse, which is the constituent feature of the category of The Absolute is one which has the discursive and semantic tools to be able overcome contradiction by means of language precisely because the question asked is one of meaning and not metaphysical or ontological. However the passage to The Absolute also highlights another feature of Weil's philosophical project, which is to create discursive tools to thematize violence in order to overcome it. This is because the categories after The Absolute thematize the relationship to discourse, as for example, the absolute and knowing refusal of discourse and meaning in The Oeuvre, the destruction (and deconstruction) of coherence in The Finite, the realization of discourse in Action, and then two reflections on the role of discourse and the individual's relation to it in the categories of Meaning and Wisdom. This is why the choice of coherence through philosophy is the fundamental choice, because the possibility to leave discourse always exists, but it is a knowing choice because it is a choice made from a previously articulated discursive background. That is, an individual is never choosing to not enter discourse: the individual, with the full weight of the tradition and the partial forms of coherence available to them is choosing to leave discourse. And in that way, this refusal of dialogue, of an agreement reached through discussion and comprises, defines pure forms of violence, which is violence understood as violence because it has already been subsumed by the tradition.  Attitudes  The discursive background, a discursive content organized around a central concept, from which the person acts without being aware that this background is just that, is what Weil calls the attitude. However, even though this content is organized around a central concept, it has not yet been formulated in a self-consciously aware way that makes claims to coherence. In this way attitudes are composite and \\"they are translated by a discourse that is itself composite, that is, ambiguous and contradictory\\".Canivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998. p. 49. The attitude is a practical posture that does not necessarily require that contradiction be resolved, as long as the life moves forward, that is, as long as the discursive resources left over in the tradition are sufficient to organize and order the individual's lived experience. However it is also what grounds categories as the implicit normative practices that categories define and thematize as a doctrine. As Marcelo Perine has noted: \\"it is the category that determines the purity and the irreducibility of the attitude, but it is the attitude that produces the category\\".Perine, Marcelo, Philosophie et violence: Sens et intention de la philosophie d'√âric Weil, Paris: Beauchesne 1991. p. 153. In this way the doctrine of the category sets out to explain the normative posture of the attitude, however, this can only happen after the category has reached a full measure of its content and sense. In that way the philosopher who undertakes explaining the attitude by structuring its conceptual elements into a coherent whole has in fact already surpassed the attitude being explained. Because the attitude is built around a concept that organizes human activity, that activity cannot be critically understood from inside the concept itself. That is not to say that the community living in normatively organized way defined by the attitude has to be aware of the limits of that concept. In fact, the articulation of the attitude into a category underlines Weil's understanding of the project of philosophy. Because the choice between philosophy and violence is a choice made in order to give meaning to human activity and made in order to overcome violence, philosophical discourse is born out of the need to reorganize a world that is no longer seen as coherent. In this way, the theorist who can coherently explain the world has already surpassed the previous conceptual content. Humanity then, always finds itself in a historically situated tradition. Thus, the question of how to ascribe meaning and how to understand the world and oneself as an individual always presents itself anew.Kirscher, Gilbert, La philosophie d'√âric Weil, Paris: PUF. p. 37-38. Weil asks the question near the end of the Logique: \\"Attitudes, both unconscious and without category, do they not direct, ordinarily, life?\\"Weil, √âric, Logique de la philosophie, Paris: Vrin, 1950. p. 415.  Reprises  The interplay between the categories and the attitudes, as well as all of the fragments of historical attempts to overcome violence through the elaboration of coherent discourse that make up the language of the tradition, are mediated by what Weil calls reprises. The reprise is \\"first off an interpretive act\\".Kirscher, Gilbert, \\" \\" Reprise\\": le concept et le mot\\" in Cultura Vol. 31, 2013. pp. 31-45. This interpretive act articulates itself in two ways. First, in terms of how the category that is being surpassed interprets the new attitude. The category explains this new content in development in its own language, which is itself inadequate to the content. Second, the way that the new attitude justifies this content by using the language of other attitudes and categories.Canivez, Patrice, \\"La notion de reprise et ses applications\\", in Cultura, Vol. 31, 2013, pp. 15-29. In this way \\"the reprise, to use a Kantian concept, is the Schema which makes the category applicable to reality and which thus allows concretely realizing the unity of philosophy and of history\\".Weil, √âric, Logique de la philosophie, Paris: Vrin, 1950. p. 82. However, because the reprise appropriates other discourses to explain a content which overflows a given discourse's capacity to adequately express it, the reprise allows an interpretation of the multiple centers of discourse that inhabit the lived human experience. Categories are a crystallization of a form of life that is actually lived as an attitude into a doctrine. Following that definition, it is the reprise that allows the different aspects of this form of life, as well as the different commitments, discursive, religious, political, held by those within this form, to explain and understand the extension and weight of these commitments. = Moral philosophy = There is a distinction that is normally drawn between Weil's practical and his theoretical philosophy, however an analysis of his practical philosophy also reveals how deeply intertwined the two are. Weil's practical philosophy can be understood as expressions of specific philosophical categories, specifically for Weil, moral philosophy is a development of \\"the content [‚Ä¶] of the conscience\\".Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 102. Which, following Kant, tries to articulate the \\"coexistence of nature and freedom\\".Canivez, Patrice, Le Politique et da logique dans l'≈ìuvre d'√âric Weil, Paris: √âditions Kim√©, 1993. In order to show this development, Weil makes a distinction between formal morality and concrete morality.Weil, √âric, Philosophie morale, Paris: Vrin, 1961. To start, formal morality is the philosophical analysis and elaboration of the moral criteria of \\"universality formulated by Kant\\"Canivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998. p. 53. as well as its source in the notion of autonomy.Kirscher, Gilbert, √âric Weil ou la raison de la philosophie, Villeneuve d'Ascq: Presses Universitaires du Septentrion, 1999. p. 67. This Kantian foundation leads to a development of a reflection on notion of rules, starting from \\"rule of the universalization of maxims\\".Kirscher, Gilbert, √âric Weil ou la raison de la philosophie, Villeneuve d'Ascq: Presses Universitaires du Septentrion, 1999. p. 71. This development is a necessary step that is born out of the \\"loss of certainty\\"Weil, √âric, Philosophie morale, Paris: Vrin, 1961. p. 13. or a loss of confidence in concrete morality. If formal morality is the philosophical reflection that tries to reconcile autonomy, rules and the criteria of universality, concrete morality is the morality of a community that just up until the loss of certainty had claimed to fill that role. In this way there is a constant tension between what is seen as the rules of a community and the ever-developing exigency to universalize the content of moral concepts. Moral action for Weil is born out of the confrontation of different moralities, this recognition forces moral agents to conduct a reflection on the content of their moral system. Starting from this reflection, the agent is confronted with a moral choice that is decided by a criterion of universalizability. Therefore, Weil's moral theory places an emphasis on how individuals become aware of the criteria of universalizability in order to see themselves as the seat of moral law. This highlights one of the largest distinctions between Weil and Kant, because for Weil, this realization of the moral law, and this self-consciousness of the individual as a moral agent is only ever a possibility.Kirscher, Gilbert, √âric Weil ou la raison de la philosophie, Villeneuve d'Ascq: Presses Universitaires du Septentrion, 1999. p. 85. Any individual, in any historic situation can just as well never become aware of their role as a moral agent responsible for the elaboration and practice of a moral content. This difference leads Weil to assert that \\"the essential task of the moral man is to educate men so that they obey on their own the universal law\\"Weil, √âric, Philosophie Politique, Paris: Vrin, 1956. p. 44. Education plays a central role in Weil's philosophy in general, where the summit of moral and political action is to lead people to reason so that they can become reasonable for themselves. In this way the interplay between coherence, universality and reasonability forms a framework that defines moral action. Thus, an important distinction is the movement from the moral law towards the moral life,Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 115. whereby notions such as happiness, satisfaction, desire, or duty start to take on a new concrete content, however a content which is now critical, having passed through the filter of the criteria of universalizability. In order to do so, \\"it is necessary to take a further step and consider morality as a relation to others, in the context of a concrete morality\\".Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 121. This step, which is the transition from morality, understood as the conscientious action of the individual trying to reconcile a conditioned nature over which the individual has no control and the expressive invention of human freedom, leads directly to Weil's political thought. For Weil, political action is mediated by this responsibility towards others that translates the criteria of universalizability into a reflection around the notion of justice. This is because justice implies \\"both equality and legality\\"Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 132. and requires the reconciliation of the universal and an actual concrete system of laws that, in a given historical context, can in fact prevent the realization of the universal. Thus the notion of justice demands a critical stance towards the actual legal practices of a given community in order to bring about this reconciliation. = Political philosophy = Weil's political philosophy is a further development of his theoretical thought. In this way, Philosophie politique, as well as the political thought that can be teased out of his other works, is an expression of the philosophical category of Action.Robinet, Jean-Fran√ßois, ¬´ Originalit√© de la philosophie politique de Weil ¬ª in Bulletin de philosophie, n. 7 p. 33. The categories following The Absolute correspond to \\"a revolt against coherence\\".Ric≈ìur, Paul, ¬´ De l'Absolu √† la Sagesse par l'Action ¬ª in Actualit√© d'√âric Weil, Paris: Editions Beauchesne, 1984. p. 412. In this way, these categories respond to individual action in the face of the project of absolute coherence. The category of The Oeuvre highlights the possibility of a rejection of discourse because, \\"the language of the man of [‚Ä¶] [this category] does not make a claim to universality or to truth. It is the language of an individual who wants to control the world, of an individual who is all for himself\\".Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 35. This category is in part Weil's response to the possibility of totalitarian violence that ravaged much of the 20th century. Although Weil's political philosophy is strongly influenced by notions that are passed down from Aristotle, Kant, Hegel,Guibal, Francis, Le Courage de la raison, Paris: √âditions du F√©lin, 2009. p. 11. and Marx,Bescond, Lucien, ¬´ Ernst Bloch et √âric Weil: A propos du Marx et du marxisme ¬ª pp. 123-141 in Cahiers √âric Weil I, ed. Jean Quillien, Lille: Presses Universitaires de Lille, 1987. it is important to note his focus on the concrete aspects of human life as it is lived. The project of coherence for Weil is one that must constantly restart, and it always risks being disrupted by novel forms of violence. Weil has noted that Action is \\"the last category of discourse\\", and in this way it is the category in which human activity is understood as a \\"the unity of life and discourse\\",Weil, √âric, Logique de la Philosophie, 413. that is, the category which gives new concrete content to both actual lived human attitudes and to the discursive categories that elaborate concepts in order to understand that activity. All Weil's political thought starts in this way from the view point of the individual, that is from the moral question of freedom, and leads to a reflection on political organization. This political organization is to be understood organically, as are his analyses of the social mechanism and the relationship, which Weil develops from Ferdinand T√∂nniesCanivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998. p. 55. between the community and civil society.T√∂nnies, Ferdinand, Community and Civil Society, translation: Margaret Hollis, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. But this organic development of communities and their interaction, often antagonistic with civil society, also leads to a reflection of the development of a theory of the State. In this way, the requirement for justice, which helps to enlarge the moral requirement of universalizability to a fully- fledged political requirement, goes hand in hand with the requirement that modern society provide a framework in which the individual's goals, objectives and projects are meaningful.Canivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998. p. 26. This requirement of meaning reconnects political activity to Weil's larger project of coherence, because it is only within an organized State that such a requirement for meaning can be fulfilled. This return of the theoretical aspect of Weil's theory corresponds to the place that discursiveness takes in his practical philosophy. For Weil, the choice of philosophy, which is the choice of coherence, is a choice made in order to overcome and subsume violence by giving it a discursive form. In order for that coherence to be an actual concrete articulation of meaning, this leads the individual to become aware of their discursive commitments through open discussion. In this way, discussion because a serious mode of political action, because for Weil \\"acting is deciding after having deliberated\\"Canivez, Patrice, Weil, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2004. p. 191. and it is only through open discussion that the conflicts, problems and differences see the light of day in order to afterwards be resolved through political compromises that reconcile different social strata and communities based around a criterion of justice. This criterion gives voice to the plurality of goals, needs, struggles, and values that exist at the interior of a given political organization. The historic and contingent content of theses commitments are developments of the natural evolution of the State, which Weil defines as \\"the organic set of institutions of a historic community\\".Weil, √âric, Philosophie Politique, Paris: Vrin p. 131. Thus, in Philosophie politique, Weil analyzes the State from a variety of perspectives. He provides a formal analysis of the modern State, which is based on a \\"formal and universal\\"Weil, √âric, Philosophie politique, Paris: Vrin, 1956. p 142. notion of law, and provides an encyclopedic analysis of different forms of political organization from autocratic to constitutional. Underlying these analyses is a defense of constitutional democracy whereby \\"each citizen is considered as a potential ruler, and not only as ruled\\".Canivez, Patrice, √âric Weil ou la question du sens, Paris: Ellipses, 1998. p. 56. This notion of potentiality implies a State defined by all citizens' capacity and eligibility to decision- making positions. It also implies a process of decision-making defined by open, public, transparent discussion involving all citizens, which is therefore universal in scope. In this sense, and by the general criteria of universalizability present in his thought, the notion of the State, and the objective to understand and overcome violence implies a form of cosmopolitanism whereby the progressive globalization of society leads to a global form of political organization. This global political organization would allow individuals to participate in an actual concrete form of freedom that gives voice to their concrete particularity and to the concrete particularity of their community. In this way a cosmopolitan global structure of States links back to the ultimate goal of Weil's theoretic philosophy, which is to explain the unity of action and discourse. Because, for Weil, it is in political organization that humanity's activity, as well as history itself, becomes meaningful, political organization is the backdrop against which moral action is possible and the concrete content of an individual's life can be articulated.

Family He was the son of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus (consul in 490 BC), and father of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus (military tribune with consular power in 402 BC and 398 BC). Biography =Consulship= In 461 BC, he was consul with Publius Volumnius Amintinus Gallus. Their terms occurred during a period of political tensions between the tribunes of the plebs, who demanded that the rights of the consuls be written down (drafted in the lex Terentilia) and the conservative patricians who opposed limitations to the consular power. The consuls tried to raise troops against the Aequi and the Volsci, traditional enemies of Rome. The tribunes used their veto to block the levy. Four of the tribunes called the people to vote on their legal draft (the lex Terentilia). The consuls refused to preside over the ballot and young patricians provoked trouble. The political process was paralysed most of the year as a result.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 10-11Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, X It is in this context that Aulus Verginius, one of the plebeian tribunes, brought the young Caeso Quinctius to trial on a capital charge of obstructing the tribunes of the plebs based primarily on the testimony of Marcus Volscius Fictor. =Decemvirate= In 454 BC, the patricians and the tribunes of the plebs came to a compromise and the Senate finally approved sending a delegation of three senators, among them Servius Sulpicius, to Athens and Southern Italy in order to study Greek law. Livy refers to Publius Sulpicius being a member of the delegation.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III.31.7-8. However, given that the decemvirs in the First Decemvirate appear to be former consuls, it seems probable Servius Sulpicius was a member of the delegation as well. The three Roman ambassadors returned in 452 BC and the report they gave to the Senate led to the creation of an extraordinary office, the decemviri consulari imperio legibus scribonis (decemviri writing the law with consular power).Livy, Ab urbe condita III. 32-33Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, X. 54-56 In 451 BC, Servius Sulpicius was in office while on the first commission of the decemvirs and participated in drafting the first ten of the twelve tables.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 33Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XII, 9Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, X. 56 =End of Career= Fall of the decemvirs In 449 BC, the Second Decemvirate had stayed in power illegally, contrary to the will of the patricians and the plebeians. The armies sent to combat the Aequi and the Sabines, commanded by eight of the ten decemvirs, revolted, returning to Rome and assembling on Monte Sacro, They demanded that the decemvirs step down. The consuls Servius Sulpicius, Spurius Tarpeius, and Gaius Julius had envoys negotiate with the plebs who had left the city.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 50.15-16 Finally, the decemvirs left their positions, eight went into exile while two were prosecuted in court, but took their own lives during the process. Legate In 446 BC, Servius Sulpicius would have been legate under the orders of the consuls Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus and Agrippa Furius Fusus during the campaign conducted against the Volsci.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 70.2-5 References  Bibliography  =Ancient bibliography= * Livy, Ab urbe condita * Diodorus Siculus, Universal History, Book XII, 9 on the site Philippe Remacle * Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, Book X, 1-16, and Book X, 45-63 at LacusCurtius =Modern bibliography= * 5th-century BC Romans Ancient Roman decemvirs Camerinus Cornutus, Servius Roman Republican consuls ","title":"Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus (consul 461 BC)"},{"id":"52420189","text":"Secret Ambition may refer to: *Secret Ambition, 1930s US radio show hosted by Tom Breneman *\\"Secret Ambition\\", single by Michael W.

It was part of the Italian War of 1551‚Äì59. Course After the assassination of Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma, son of Pope Paul III, the papal states wished to regain the duchy he had set up. Pier Luigi's son Ottavio Farnese was Charles V's son-in-law and took possession of the duchy despite Paul III and Julius III's opposition. Ottavio approached Henry II of France, who had his own reasons to oppose the papal claim to the duchy. Shortly after negotiations opened, Julius III and Charles V began a war against Parma. The House of Farnese also left its alliance with the pope and the Holy Roman Empire to ally itself with Parma and France. Ferrante Gonzaga, Governor of the Duchy of Milan, occupied Brescello and prepared for the siege of Parma. Despite assistance from French troops, Orazio was beaten near Mirandola. Henry II also ordered Charles de Coss√©, Count of Brissac to invade Piedmont, forcing Gonzaga to lessen his pressure on the duchy of Parma in September 1551, making it bear the main burden of the war. In 1551 Julius sent his nephew Gian Battista Del Monte to besiege Mirandola, then held by a small French force under Piero Strozzi. The siege ended on Good Friday 1552 with Del Monte's death.\\\\- the events are described in Antonio Saltini's historical novel L'assedio della Mirandola, Edizioni Diabasis Julius had opened negotiations with France on 9 September 1551 by sending Girolamo Verallo as his legate to Henry. After the failure at Mirandola these were re-opened, before breaking down due to France's excessive claims. When the pope discovered that Charles was in major difficulties, negotiations resumed again and on 29 April 1552 an accord was sealed. This mandated a two year truce, allowing Ottavio to make a peace treaty with the pope and restoring the duchy of Castro to the Farnese. Charles took eleven days to ratify the accord, which he did on 10 May. References  Bibliography  * P. Courteault, Blaise de Monluc Historien, 1908, p 190, * A.

Born in Dresden, in 1964 he escaped to West Berlin and soon after became a student of the Informel painter and graphic artist Hann Trier (1915‚Äì99) at Berlin University's Fine Art Academy. In 1977 he was among the first to receive the Schmidt-Rottluff award. This was followed in 1981‚Äì82 by a Villa Massimo Rome fellowship, one of the most important distinctions for a young German artist. In 1998 there were retrospectives of his woodcuts in Kassel, Wuppertal and 'Between Concrete and Utopia' at Kunstmuseum Villa Zanders in Bergisch Gladbach. Kaminsky was subsequently commissioned to make artworks for the residence of the German ambassador in Beijing. Many of his works concern the period before and after the Russian Revolution (1917). They explore the possibility of a utopia in which cultural production was allowed to flourish, before the struggles and the tensions of the Soviet era and the Cold War emerged in Russia and its satellite states behind the Iron Curtain. The influence of European Abstract Expressionism circa 1950 permeates his approach as it does the work of German contemporaries Anselm Kiefer and George Baselitz. Kaminsky's works, particularly in his large-scale woodcuts, are populated with symbolic motifs and characters which include Kazimir Malevich's paintings, the revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin and the artist himself as a child holding a toy windmill (a surrogate signature). Kaminsky's work is exhibited regularly in Germany and further afield, and can be found in major group exhibitions and museum collections including the contemporary art collection of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Neuer Berliner Kunstverein/ and others.

Its main section built in 1857, it is a prominent local example of Italianate architecture, with both older and newer ells to the rear. It is now home to a non-profit senior living facility, operating on the premises since 1932. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history The Lucy Ruggles House is located in eastern Burlington, south of the central campus of the University of Vermont. It is located on the east side of South Prospect Street, between the two ends of Robinson Parkway, a residential loop road built on part of the house's former estate. The house is a 2-1/2 story brick building, whose main section is Italianate in style. Distinctive features include paired brackets in the eaves, a single-story porch wrapping across the front and side, and large three-story mansard-roofed tower at the front left. To the rear of the house is a two-story ell that was probably built in the 1820s, with a 20th- century addition extending further to the rear. The interior of the main block retains most of its original Italianate woodwork, while the first ell contains traces of Greek Revival styling. with The oldest portion of the house, its first ell, was probably built in the 1820s by Jesse Hollister, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Its Italianate main section was built in 1857 by George DeForest, a resident of New York City who turned the property into a summer estate. In 1927, of the estate, including the main house, was purchased by Dr. Charles Robinson, who subdivided the land for additional housing, and opened a sanitarium in the house. In 1930, the house was purchased by the Ruggles Foundation. Established by bequest from Lucy Ruggles, a teacher with no connection to Burlington, the foundation's objective was to provide an affordable retirement premises for teachers. Opened in 1932, its endowment declined over time, and the facility was slated to close in 2000. It was purchased by Cathedral Square in 2001 and extensively rehabilitated, including restoration of its public rooms and the construction of the rear addition. It now consists of 14 studio apartments.

From 1956 to 1960, she served as its Director. Military career In 1938, Barnett joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a volunteer (IE private), and was assigned to No. 45 County of Oxford Company. She transferred to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) when it was established on 28 June 1939. She was commissioned into the WAAF as a company assistant (equivalent to a pilot officer in the Royal Air Force), with seniority from 5 December 1938. During World War II, she served at RAF Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire, at RAF Feltwell in Norfolk, and at the Air Ministry in London. Barnett was present for the London Blitz and witnessed the destruction of the House of Commons as well as other places. At that time, she was stationed there and air women like herself worked on various tasks at the Air Ministry. Barnett states \\"Never once did they speak of their secret work, seldom were they late for duty, even after a raid. They were known as the Whitehall Warriors.\\" After the end of the war, in the summer of 1945, Barnett was posted to RAF Mediterranean Command in Caserta, Italy. There, she served as the \\"staff officer responsible for all WAAF personnel working in the RAF Mediterranean and Middle East command\\". She traveled to Vienna to seek out the possibility of stationing air women there. In October 1947, she returned to the United Kingdom and was appointed as an WAAF staff officer at Flying Training Command headquarters.

Zeta helps companies create, maintain and monetize customers, providing customers with enhanced multichannel marketing tools to help them manage the full customer life-cycle. The privately owned company's headquarters are in New York City, with additional offices worldwide, including Silicon Valley, London, as well as Chennai and Hyderabad in India. Zeta has more than 1300 employees worldwide. The company's CEO is David A. Steinberg. Forbes Magazine reported that the company has been referred to as a 'Unicorn' - a \\"billion-dollar startup\\". According to The Wall Street Journal, as of March 2020 the company‚Äôs annual revenue is more than $400 Million and is profitable. History Zeta Global was founded by David A. Steinberg and former Apple Inc. CEO John Sculley in 2007 under the name 'XL Marketing'. The company changed its name to 'Zeta Interactive' in 2014, then again to 'Zeta Global' in October 2016. As of April 2017, Zeta had bought nine companies in the past nine years. In July 2015, the company raised US $125 million from Blackstone's GSO Capital Partners to grow its business through the acquisition of data startup companies. In November 2013, Zeta acquired the Adchemy Actions division from ad tech firm Adchemy, as to incorporate their 'machine learning' based advertising platform. In January 2014, they acquired Clicksquared, a Boston-based company that created 'The Hub', a SaaS-based, cross-channel campaign management platform. In late 2015, they acquired the customer relationship management division of eBay's Enterprise operation, in a deal which sources near the company said was worth US$80‚Äì90 million. CEO Steinberg said that the deal \\"gets us a long way toward becoming the largest customer lifecycle management platform.\\" In August 2016, they announced that they purchased the marketing automation tool 'Acxiom Impact' from marketing technology and services company Acxiom, in a deal which sources said was worth more than US$50 million.

Charlotte Woman's club was and still is very active in the community. They established the first kindergarten in the city. During both world wars, they staffed city buses and the Southern Railway station with volunteers. They were also involved with organizing the YWCA, PTA and Traveler's Aid in Charlotte. They also brought the first public health nurses to Charlotte and helped create the League of Women Voters. The CWC also supported the creation of the Mint Museum of Art and the Domestic Relations Court.  History  It was organized by six women in April 1899 as the Charlotte Mothers' Club. In 1901, twenty-five more women joined and the group was officially renamed to the Charlotte Woman's Club (CWC) with Mrs. F.C. Abbot as the first president. The club became part of the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs (NCFWC) in 1903. The CWC would send delegates to the annual conference for the NCFWC. Later, they joined the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) in 1908. The club also sent delegates, sometimes to conventions as far away as California. The Charlotte Club was incorporated in 1920. By 1905 the club had 86 members and was holding meetings twice a month. By the 1920s the club's 500 members meant the club had to find a new meeting place, so the club made plans to purchase property and build a place where they could meet. Prior to purchasing their own place, they met at the Charlotte Mint. The CWC clubhouse stands on 1001 East Morehead Street and was designed by architect, Charles C. Hook. The women received the deed in 1923. It was dedicated a historic landmark in 1978 and was sold in 2008. The club has been involved with charitable and public service work since its early days. In 1900, members of the group sent care packages to United States soldiers in the Philippine Insurrection. The CWC advocated for public children's playgrounds as early as 1910. They were also involved in citywide cleanup and beautification projects. Members of the group have been involved in education. The CWC wanted the city of Charlotte to take the lead in public education. CWC created the first kindergarten in Charlotte. When the NCFWC was requesting in 1910 that individual clubs vote on whether or not they wanted to address the issue of women's suffrage, the CWC voted against it. The club, while it was initially a mainly white-only organization, helped set up nursing clinics by the 1920s where both African American and European American nurses worked and were paid in part by the CWC. They had also advocated for integrated efforts to aid World War I programs. During both World War I and World War II, CWC staffed buses and train stations.

It was deposited quickly and is approximately 175 m thick. The Blue Pinion Formation was originally recognized as a separate formation, but is now interpreted as an expression of the Random Formation.  Sedimentology  Its white arenitic sandstones are very distinctive, recognizable from their herringbone cross-stratification that denotes the influence of storm systems. Interbedded green-grey sands and silts represent an intertidal setting. Spatial distribution It is widespread throughout Newfoundland unlike its underlying units. It was deposited in intertidal mud flats to subtidal setting, then (later) near the bottom of an open marine shelf. The top of the unit intergrades with the overlying strata.  Stratigraphy Synaresis cracks in the Random Formation, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland Some studies assign the Random Formation as the lowest unit of the Adeyton Group, but strictly it is below that group. It overlies the Chapel Island formation, which contains the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary. The unit is often strongly folded.  Age Megaripples in the quartz arenites of the Random Formation The formation is difficult to date, but is considered Precambrian, as it lies unconformably under the Bonavista Formation and conformably above Ediacaran strata. It does sit above the Chapel Island Formation on the Burin peninsula meaning that, at that location, the lower boundary is in the Lower Cambrian. Inarticulate brachiopods have been found in its upper strata, dating these to the late early or even early mid Cambrian. However, it is likely that the unit is diachronous and may date into the Ediacaran further to the east. The Cambrian stage 2 - stage 3 boundary (Tommotian/Atdabanian) has been reported as being within the Random Formation, or possibly in the overlying Bonavista Formation. The overlying Smith Point Formation hosts the first trilobites.  Palaeontology  The trilobite-like trace fossils Rusophycus and Cruziana occur in the Random Formation, alongside a range of other ichnofossils including Diplocraterion, Paleodictyon, Scolicia, and Squamodictyon. Body fossils include the small shelly fauna Aldanella attleborensis assemblage.

It protects a coastal area in the Atlantic Forest biome. There are issues due to a sizeable population of traditional residents in the park. Location The Acara√≠ State Park is in the municipality of S√£o Francisco do Sul, Santa Catarina. It has an area of about on the coastal plain of the island of S√£o Francisco, and includes the Tamboretes archipelago. It protects one of the most important continuous remnants of coastal ecosystems in the state, the Praia Grande restinga. History The park has its origins in the creation of a municipal commission created in 2002 to discuss implementing a conservation unit. The process was kicked off by municipal decree 109 of March 2002 with government and civil society representatives. The park was created by state decree 3.517 of 23 September 2005 with the goal of preserving an area of Atlantic Forest with scenic beauty and biodiversity, and to increase knowledge of pre-colonial and colonial history. The steelmaker Vega do Sul paid R$10,100,000 as environmental compensation when it was established in S√£o Francisco do Sul in the early 2000s. This money was to be used to compensate the owners of over 1,000 small lots in the park, with priority for the elderly or seriously ill, people with well-documented ownership and people who lived in the park before it was created. A 2007 paper argued that the category should be changed to a sustainable development reserve due to the presence of an indigenous population within the park. The park's management plan was published on 13 October 2014, providing guidance to the consultative council on deployment of the park. Environment The vegetation in the Acara√≠ State Park is predominantly dense lowland rainforest, with some dense submontane rainforest on two small, isolated elevations, and dense alluvial rainforest on some banks of the Acara√≠ River. In addition, there are large areas of pioneer formations of marine and fluvial influence, dunes, restinga and mangroves in the estuarine areas. The water complex formed by the Acara√≠ River, the sources of the Perequ√™ River and the Capivaru Lagoon give shelter, food and breeding areas for several aquatic species. The restinga and lowland Atlantic Forest protect flora and fauna, including endemic and endangered species. Fauna identified to date include 337 species of birds, 35 of reptiles (5 sea turtles, 1 freshwater turtle, 1 crocodilian, 6 lizards, 1 amphisbaenid and 19 snakes). 17 of amphibians, 20 of non-flying mammals and 38 of fish in the Acara√≠ River. The park also includes the Tamboretes Archipelago, four islands that provide a breeding area for several species of birds. Underwater life beside the Tamboretes Archipelago Human activities As of 2016 there were plans to build an administrative headquarters and visitor center. The park staff give lectures in schools in the region and take groups of students on educational activities inside the park. The park is used for research, including studies of the macaco-prego, benthic fauna and fish. The islands are off limits to visitors, and in a buffer zone of around the islands fishing and underwater hunting are prohibited, but diving to view the rich marine fauna is allowed. Hunting, logging and fishing are allowed only for the traditional population of the park. Efforts are being made to control invasive species such as pines. In the high season of summer the integrity of the park is threatened by tourists who ride trail bikes and drive jeeps through the dunes.

It is a progestogen and is used in combination with estrogens mainly in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low sex hormone levels in women. It is also used in women to support pregnancy and fertility and to treat gynecological disorders. Progesterone can be taken by mouth, in through the vagina, and by injection into muscle or fat, among other routes. A progesterone vaginal ring and progesterone intrauterine device used for birth control also exist in some areas of the world. Progesterone is well tolerated and often produces few or no side effects. However, a number of side effects are possible, for instance mood changes. If progesterone is taken by mouth or at high doses, certain central side effects including sedation, sleepiness, and cognitive impairment can also occur. The medication is a naturally occurring progestogen and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), the biological target of progestogens like endogenous progesterone. It opposes the effects of estrogens in various parts of the body like the uterus and also blocks the effects of the hormone aldosterone. In addition, progesterone has neurosteroid effects in the brain. Progesterone was first isolated in pure form in 1934. It first became available as a medication later that year. Oral micronized progesterone (OMP), which allowed progesterone to be taken by mouth, was introduced in 1980. A large number of synthetic progestogens, or progestins, have been derived from progesterone and are used as medications as well. Examples include medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone. In 2017, it was the 195th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical uses =Hormone therapy= Menopause Progesterone is used in combination with an estrogen as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women. It is used specifically to provide endometrial protection against unopposed estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with intact uteruses. A 2016 systematic review of endometrial protection with progesterone recommended 100 mg/day continuous oral progesterone, 200 mg/day cyclic oral progesterone, 45 to 100 mg/day cyclic vaginal progesterone, and 100 mg alternate-day vaginal progesterone. Twice-weekly 100 mg vaginal progesterone was also recommended, but more research is needed on this dose and endometrial monitoring may be advised. Transdermal progesterone was not recommended for endometrial protection. The REPLENISH trial was the first adequately powered study to show that continuous 100 mg/day oral progesterone with food provides adequate endometrial protection. Cyclic 200 mg/day oral progesterone has also been found to be effective in the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia, for instance in the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial. However, the PEPI trial was not adequately powered to fully quantify endometrial hyperplasia or cancer risk. No adequately powered studies have assessed endometrial protection with vaginal progesterone. In any case, the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) found that cyclic 45 mg/day vaginal progesterone gel showed no significant difference from placebo in endometrial cancer rates. Due to the vaginal first-pass effect, low doses of vaginal progesterone may allow for adequate endometrial protection. Although not sufficiently powered, various other smaller studies have also found endometrial protection with oral or vaginal progesterone. There is inadequate evidence for endometrial protection with transdermal progesterone cream. Oral progesterone at 300 mg/day alone has been found to significantly reduce hot flashes relative to placebo. The combination of an estrogen and oral progesterone likewise reduces hot flashes. Estrogen plus oral progesterone has been found to significantly improve quality of life. The combination of an estrogen and 100 to 300 mg/day oral progesterone has been found to improve sleep outcomes. Moreover, sleep was improved to a significantly better extent than estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate. This may be attributable to the sedative neurosteroid effects of progesterone. Reduction of hot flashes may also help to improve sleep outcomes. Based on animal research, progesterone may be involved in sexual function in women. However, very limited clinical research suggests that progesterone does not improve sexual desire or function in women. The combination of an estrogen and oral progesterone has been found to improve bone mineral density (BMD) to a similar extent as an estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate. Progestogens, including progesterone, may have beneficial effects on bone independent of those of estrogens, although more research is required to confirm this notion. The combination of an estrogen and oral or vaginal progesterone has been found to improve cardiovascular health in women in early menopause but not in women in late menopause. Estrogen therapy has a favorable influence on the blood lipid profile, which may translate to improved cardiovascular health. The addition of oral or vaginal progesterone has neutral or beneficial effects on these changes. This is in contrast to various progestins, which are known to antagonize the beneficial effects of estrogens on blood lipids. Progesterone, both alone and in combination with an estrogen, has been found to have beneficial effects on skin and to slow the rate of skin aging in postmenopausal women. In the French E3N-EPIC observational study, the risk of diabetes was significantly lower in women on menopausal hormone therapy, including with the combination of an oral or transdermal estrogen and oral progesterone or a progestin. Transgender women Progesterone is used as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women in combination with estrogens and antiandrogens. However, the addition of progestogens to HRT for transgender women is controversial and their role is unclear. Some patients and clinicians believe anecdotally that progesterone may enhance breast development, improve mood, and increase sex drive. However, there is a lack of evidence from well-designed studies to support these notions at present. In addition, progestogens can produce undesirable side effects, although bioidentical progesterone may be safer and better tolerated than synthetic progestogens like medroxyprogesterone acetate. Because some believe that progestogens are necessary for full breast development, progesterone is sometimes used in transgender women with the intention of enhancing breast development. However, a 2014 review concluded the following on the topic of progesterone for enhancing breast development in transgender women: :\\"Our knowledge concerning the natural history and effects of different cross-sex hormone therapies on breast development in [transgender] women is extremely sparse and based on low quality of evidence. Current evidence does not provide evidence that progestogens enhance breast development in [transgender] women. Neither do they prove the absence of such an effect. This prevents us from drawing any firm conclusion at this moment and demonstrates the need for further research to clarify these important clinical questions.\\" Data on menstruating women shows there is no correlation between water retention, and levels of progesterone or estrogen. Despite this, some theorise progesterone might cause temporary breast enlargement due to local fluid retention, and may thus give a misleading appearance of breast growth. Aside from a hypothetical involvement in breast development, progestogens are not otherwise known to be involved in physical feminization. =Pregnancy support= Vaginally dosed progesterone is being investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in women with a history of preterm birth. According to a recent study, women with a short cervix that received hormonal treatment with a progesterone gel had their risk of prematurely giving birth reduced. The hormone treatment was administered vaginally every day during the second half of a pregnancy. A subsequent and larger study showed that vaginal progesterone was no better than placebo in preventing recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of a previous preterm birth, but a planned secondary analysis of the data in this trial showed that women with a short cervix at baseline in the trial had benefit in two ways: a reduction in births less than 32 weeks and a reduction in both the frequency and the time their babies were in intensive care. In another trial, vaginal progesterone was shown to be better than placebo in reducing preterm birth prior to 34 weeks in women with an extremely short cervix at baseline. An editorial by Roberto Romero discusses the role of sonographic cervical length in identifying patients who may benefit from progesterone treatment. A meta-analysis published in 2011 found that vaginal progesterone cut the risk of premature births by 42 percent in women with short cervixes. The meta- analysis, which pooled published results of five large clinical trials, also found that the treatment cut the rate of breathing problems and reduced the need for placing a baby on a ventilator. =Fertility support= Progesterone is used for luteal support in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). It is also used to correct luteal phase deficiency to prepare the endometrium for implantation in infertility therapy and is used to support early pregnancy. =Birth control= A progesterone vaginal ring is available for birth control when breastfeeding in a number of areas of the world. An intrauterine device containing progesterone has also been marketed under the brand name Progestasert for birth control, including previously in the United States. =Gynecological disorders= Progesterone is used to control persistent anovulatory bleeding. It is used in non-pregnant women with a delayed menstruation of one or more weeks, in order to allow the thickened endometrial lining to slough off. This process is termed a progesterone withdrawal bleed. Progesterone is taken orally for a short time (usually one week), after which it is discontinued and bleeding should occur. =Other uses= Progesterone is of unclear benefit for the reversal of mifepristone-induced abortion. Evidence is insufficient to support use in traumatic brain injury. Progesterone has been used as a topical medication applied to the scalp to treat female and male pattern hair loss. Variable effectiveness has been reported, but overall its effectiveness for this indication in both sexes has been poor. Breast pain Progesterone is approved under the brand name Progestogel as a 1% topical gel for local application to the breasts to treat breast pain in certain countries. It is not approved for systemic therapy. It has been found in clinical studies to inhibit estrogen-induced proliferation of breast epithelial cells and to abolish breast pain and tenderness in women with the condition. However, in one small study in women with cyclic breast pain it was ineffective. Vaginal progesterone has also been found to be effective in the treatment of breast pain and tenderness. Premenstrual syndrome Historically, progesterone has been widely used in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. A 2012 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for or against the effectiveness of progesterone for this indication. Another review of 10 studies found that progesterone was not effective for this condition, although it stated that insufficient evidence is available currently to make a definitive statement on progesterone in premenstrual syndrome. Catamenial epilepsy Progesterone can be used to treat catamenial epilepsy by supplementation during certain periods of the menstrual cycle. =Available forms= Progesterone is available in a variety of different forms, including oral capsules; sublingual tablets; vaginal capsules, tablets, gels, suppositories, and rings; rectal suppositories; oil solutions for intramuscular injection; and aqueous solutions for subcutaneous injection. A 1% topical progesterone gel is approved for local application to the breasts to treat breast pain, but is not indicated for systemic therapy. Progesterone was previously available as an intrauterine device for use in hormonal contraception, but this formulation was discontinued. Progesterone is also limitedly available in combination with estrogens such as estradiol and estradiol benzoate for use by intramuscular injection. In addition to approved pharmaceutical products, progesterone is available in unregulated custom compounded and over-the- counter formulations like systemic transdermal creams and other preparations. The systemic efficacy of transdermal progesterone is controversial and has not been demonstrated. Contraindications Contraindications of progesterone include hypersensitivity to progesterone or progestogens, prevention of cardiovascular disease (a Black Box warning), thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorder, cerebral hemorrhage, impaired liver function or disease, breast cancer, reproductive organ cancers, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, missed menstruations, miscarriage, or a history of these conditions. Progesterone should be used with caution in people with conditions that may be adversely affected by fluid retention such as epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, cardiac dysfunction, and renal dysfunction. It should also be used with caution in patients with anemia, diabetes mellitus, a history of depression, previous ectopic pregnancy, venereal disease, and unresolved abnormal Pap smear. Use of progesterone is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, the medication has been deemed usually safe in breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but should not be used during the first four months of pregnancy. Some progesterone formulations contain benzyl alcohol, and this may cause a potentially fatal \\"gasping syndrome\\" if given to premature infants. Side effects Progesterone is well tolerated, and many clinical studies have reported no side effects. Side effects of progesterone may include abdominal cramps, back pain, breast tenderness, constipation, nausea, dizziness, edema, vaginal bleeding, hypotension, fatigue, dysphoria, depression, and irritability, among others. Central nervous system depression, such as sedation and cognitive/memory impairment, can also occur. Vaginal progesterone may be associated with vaginal irritation, itchiness, and discharge, decreased libido, painful sexual intercourse, vaginal bleeding or spotting in association with cramps, and local warmth or a \\"feeling of coolness\\" without discharge. Intramuscular injection may cause mild-to-moderate pain at the site of injection. High intramuscular doses of progesterone have been associated with increased body temperature, which may be alleviated with paracetamol treatment. Progesterone lacks undesirable off-target hormonal activity, in contrast to various progestins. As a result, it is not associated with androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, or glucocorticoid effects. Conversely, progesterone can still produce side effects related to its antimineralocorticoid and neurosteroid activity. Compared to the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate, there are fewer reports of breast tenderness with progesterone. In addition, the magnitude and duration of vaginal bleeding with progesterone are reported to be lower than with medroxyprogesterone acetate. =Central depression= Progesterone can produce central nervous system depression as an adverse effect, particularly with oral administration or with high doses of progesterone. These side effects may include drowsiness, sedation, sleepiness, fatigue, sluggishness, reduced vigor, dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, and cognitive, memory, and/or motor impairment. Limited available evidence has shown minimal or no adverse influence on cognition with oral progesterone (100‚Äì600 mg), vaginal progesterone (45 mg gel), or progesterone by intramuscular injection (25‚Äì200 mg). However, high doses of oral progesterone (300‚Äì1200 mg), vaginal progesterone (100‚Äì200 mg), and intramuscular progesterone (100‚Äì200 mg) have been found to result in dose-dependent fatigue, drowsiness, and decreased vigor. Moreover, high single doses of oral progesterone (1200 mg) produced significant cognitive and memory impairment. Intravenous infusion of high doses of progesterone (e.g., 500 mg) has been found to induce deep sleep in humans. Some individuals are more sensitive and can experience considerable sedative and hypnotic effects at lower doses of oral progesterone (e.g., 400 mg). Sedation and cognitive and memory impairment with progesterone are attributable to its inhibitory neurosteroid metabolites. These metabolites occur to a greater extent with oral progesterone, and may be minimized by switching to a parenteral route. Progesterone can also be taken before bed to avoid these side effects and to help with sleep. The neurosteroid effects of progesterone are unique to progesterone and are not shared with progestins. =Breast cancer= Breast cell proliferation has been found to be significantly increased by the combination of an oral estrogen plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate in postmenopausal women but not by the combination of transdermal estradiol plus oral progesterone. Studies of topical estradiol and progesterone applied to the breasts for 2 weeks have been found to result in highly pharmacological local levels of estradiol and progesterone. These studies have assessed breast proliferation markers and have found increased proliferation with estradiol alone, decreased proliferation with progesterone, and no change in proliferation with estradiol and progesterone combined. In the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial, the combination of estrogen and cyclic oral progesterone resulted in a higher mammographic breast density than estrogen alone (3.1% vs. 0.9%) but a non-significantly lower breast density than the combination of estrogen and cyclic or continuous medroxyprogesterone acetate (3.1% vs. 4.4‚Äì4.6%). Higher breast density is a strong known risk factor for breast cancer. Other studies have had mixed findings however. A 2018 systematic review reported that breast density with an estrogen plus oral progesterone was significantly increased in three studies and unchanged in two studies. Changes in breast density with progesterone appear to be less than with the compared progestins. In large short-term observational studies, estrogen alone and the combination of estrogen and oral progesterone have generally not been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Conversely, the combination of estrogen and almost any progestin, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone acetate, has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The only exception among progestins is dydrogesterone, which has shown similar risk to that of oral progesterone. Breast cancer risk with estrogen and progestin therapy is duration-dependent, with the risk being significantly greater with more than 5 years of exposure relative to less than 5 years. In contrast to shorter-term studies, the longer-term observations (>5 years) of the French E3N study showed significant associations of both estrogen plus oral progesterone and estrogen plus dydrogesterone with higher breast cancer risk, similarly to estrogen plus other progestogens. Oral progesterone has very low bioavailability and has relatively weak progestogenic effects. The delayed onset of breast cancer risk with estrogen plus oral progesterone is potentially consistent with a weak proliferative effect of oral progesterone on the breasts. As such, a longer duration of exposure may be necessary for a detectable increase in breast cancer risk to occur. In any case, the risk remains lower than that with most progestins. A 2018 systematic review of progesterone and breast cancer concluded that short-term use (<5 years) of an estrogen plus progesterone is not associated with a significant increase in risk of breast cancer but that long-term use (>5 years) is associated with greater risk. The conclusions for progesterone were the same in a 2019 meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence by the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer (CGHFBC). Most data on breast density changes and breast cancer risk are with oral progesterone. Data on breast safety with vaginal progesterone are scarce. The Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) was a randomized controlled trial of about 650 postmenopausal women who used estradiol and 45 mg/day cyclic vaginal progesterone. Incidence of breast cancer was reported as an adverse effect. The absolute incidences were 10 cases in the estradiol plus vaginal progesterone group and 8 cases in the control group. However, the study was not adequately powered for quantifying breast cancer risk. =Blood clots= Whereas the combination of estrogen and a progestin is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) relative to estrogen alone, there is no difference in risk of VTE with the combination of estrogen and oral progesterone relative to estrogen alone. Hence, in contrast to progestins, oral progesterone added to estrogen does not appear to increase coagulation or VTE risk. The reason for the differences between progesterone and progestins in terms of VTE risk are unclear. However, they may be due to very low progesterone levels and relatively weak progestogenic effects produced by oral progesterone. In contrast to oral progesterone, non-oral progesterone‚Äîwhich can achieve much higher progesterone levels‚Äîhas not been assessed in terms of VTE risk. Overdose Progesterone is likely to be relatively safe in overdose. Levels of progesterone during pregnancy are up to 100-fold higher than during normal menstrual cycling, although levels increase gradually over the course of pregnancy. Oral dosages of progesterone of as high as 3,600 mg/day have been assessed in clinical trials, with the main side effect being sedation. There is a case report of progesterone misuse with an oral dosage of 6,400 mg per day. Administration of as much as 500 mg progesterone by intravenous infusion in humans was uneventful in terms of toxicity, but did induce deep sleep, though the individuals were still able to be awakened with sufficient stimulation. Interactions There are several notable drug interactions with progesterone. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline may increase the GABAA receptor-related central depressant effects of progesterone by enhancing its conversion into 5Œ±-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone via activation of 3Œ±-HSD. Progesterone potentiates the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Notably, there is a case report of progesterone abuse alone with very high doses. 5Œ±-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride inhibit the conversion of progesterone into the inhibitory neurosteroid allopregnanolone, and for this reason, may have the potential to reduce the sedative and related effects of progesterone. Progesterone is a weak but significant agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), and has been found to induce several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, especially when concentrations are high, such as with pregnancy range levels. As such, progesterone may have the potential to accelerate the metabolism of various medications. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Progesterone is a progestogen, or an agonist of the nuclear progesterone receptors (PRs), the PR-A, PR-B, and PR-C. In addition, progesterone is an agonist of the membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs), including the mPRŒ±, mPRŒ≤, mPRŒ≥, mPRŒ¥, and mPRœµ. Aside from the PRs and mPRs, progesterone is a potent antimineralocorticoid, or antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, the biological target of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. In addition to its activity as a steroid hormone, progesterone is a neurosteroid. Among other neurosteroid activities, and via its active metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, progesterone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, the major signaling receptor of the inhibitory neurotransmitter Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The PRs are expressed widely throughout the body, including in the uterus, cervix, vagina, fallopian tubes, breasts, fat, skin, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and in other areas of the brain. In accordance, progesterone has numerous effects throughout the body. Among other effects, progesterone produces changes in the female reproductive system, the breasts, and the brain. Progesterone has functional antiestrogenic effects due to its progestogenic activity, including in the uterus, cervix, and vagina. The effects of progesterone may influence health in both positive and negative ways. In addition to the aforementioned effects, progesterone has antigonadotropic effects due to its progestogenic activity, and can inhibit ovulation and suppress gonadal sex hormone production. The activities of progesterone besides those mediated by the PRs and mPRs are also of significance. Progesterone lowers blood pressure and reduces water and salt retention among other effects via its antimineralocorticoid activity. In addition, progesterone can produce sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, euphoric, cognitive-, memory-, and motor-impairing, anticonvulsant, and even anesthetic effects via formation of sufficiently high concentrations of its neurosteroid metabolites and consequent GABAA receptor potentiation in the brain. There are differences between progesterone and progestins, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone, with implications for pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, as well as for efficacy, tolerability, and safety. =Pharmacokinetics= The pharmacokinetics of progesterone are dependent on its route of administration. The medications is approved in the form of oil- filled capsules containing micronized progesterone for oral administration, termed oral micronized progesterone or OMP. It is also available in the form of vaginal or rectal suppositories or pessaries, topical creams and gels, oil solutions for intramuscular injection, and aqueous solutions for subcutaneous injection. Routes of administration that progesterone has been used by include oral, intranasal, transdermal/topical, vaginal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous injection. Vaginal progesterone is available in the form of progesterone capsules, tablets or inserts, gels, suppositories or pessaries, and rings. Chemistry Steroids Progesterone is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid and is also known as pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. It has a double bond (4-ene) between the C4 and C5 positions and two ketone groups (3,20-dione), one at the C3 position and the other at the C20 position. Due to its pregnane core and C4(5) double bond, progesterone is often abbreviated as P4. It is contrasted with pregnenolone, which has a C5(6) double bond and is often abbreviated as P5. =Derivatives= A large number of progestins, or synthetic progestogens, have been derived from progesterone. They can be categorized into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, 17Œ±-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. The progesterone ethers quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) and progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether are among the only examples that do not belong to any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone. A variety of synthetic inhibitory neurosteroids have been derived from progesterone and its neurosteroid metabolites, allopregnanolone and pregnanolone. Examples include alfadolone, alfaxolone, ganaxolone, hydroxydione, minaxolone, and renanolone. In addition, C3 and C20 conjugates of progesterone, such as progesterone carboxymethyloxime (progesterone 3-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime; P4-3-CMO), P1-185 (progesterone 3-O-(L-valine)-E-oxime), EIDD-1723 (progesterone 20E-[O-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]oxime] sodium salt), EIDD-036 (progesterone 20-oxime; P4-20-O), and VOLT-02 (chemical structure unreleased), have been developed as water-soluble prodrugs of progesterone and its neurosteroid metabolites.Guthrie, D. B., Lockwood, M. A., Natchus, M. G., Liotta, D. C., Stein, D. G., & Sayeed, I. (2017). U.S. Patent No. 9,802,978. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. https://patents.google.com/patent/US9802978B2/en =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of progesterone have been published. History =Discovery and synthesis= The hormonal action of progesterone was discovered in 1929. Pure crystalline progesterone was isolated in 1934 and its chemical structure was determined. Later that year, chemical synthesis of progesterone was accomplished. Shortly following its chemical synthesis, progesterone began being tested clinically in women. =Injections and implants= In 1933 or 1934, Schering introduced progesterone in oil solution as a medication by intramuscular injection under the brand name Proluton. This was the first pharmaceutical formulation of progesterone to be marketed for medical use. It was initially a corpus luteum extract, becoming pure synthesized progesterone only subsequently. A clinical study of the formulation was published in 1933. Multiple formulations of progesterone in oil solution for intramuscular injection, under the brand names Proluton, Progestin, and Gestone, were available by 1936. A parenteral route was used because oral progesterone had very low activity and was thought to be inactive. Progesterone was initially very expensive due to the large doses required. However, with the start of steroid manufacturing from diosgenin in the 1940s, costs greatly decreased. Subcutaneous pellet implants of progesterone were first studied in women in the late 1930s. They were the first long-acting progestogen formulation. Pellets were reported to be extruded out of the skin within a few weeks at high rates, even when implanted beneath the deep fascia, and also produced frequent inflammatory reactions at the site of implantation. In addition, they were absorbed too slowly and achieved unsatisfactorily low progesterone levels. Consequently, they were soon abandoned, in favor of other preparations such as aqueous suspensions. However, subcutaneous pellet implants of progesterone were later studied as a form of birth control in women in the 1980s and early 1990s, though no preparations were ultimately marketed. Aqueous suspensions of progesterone crystals for intramuscular injection were first described in 1944. These preparations were on the market in the 1950s under a variety of brand names including Flavolutan, Luteosan, Lutocyclin M, and Lutren, among others. Aqueous suspensions of steroids were developed because they showed much longer durations than intramuscular injection of steroids in oil solution. However, local injection site reactions, which do not occur with oil solutions, have limited the clinical use of aqueous suspensions of progesterone and other steroids. Today, a preparation with the brand name Agolutin Depot remains on the market in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.https://www.drugs.com/international/agolutin.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190519061250/http://www.sukl.cz/download/spc/SPC14550.pdf A combined preparation of progesterone, estradiol benzoate, and lidocaine remains available with the brand name Clinomin Forte in Paraguay as well.https://web.archive.org/web/20200818223302/http://www.indufar.com.py/files/shares/prospectos/400000154.pdf In addition to aqueous suspensions, water-in-oil emulsions of steroids were studied by 1949, and long-acting emulsions of progesterone were introduced for use by intramuscular injection under the brand names Progestin and Di-Pro- Emulsion (with estradiol benzoate) by the 1950s. Due to lack of standardization of crystal sizes, crystalline suspensions of steroids had marked variations in effect. Emulsions were said to be even more unreliable. Macrocrystalline aqueous suspensions of progesterone as well as microspheres of progesterone were investigated as potential progestogen-only injectable contraceptives and combined injectable contraceptives (with estradiol) by the late 1980s and early 1990s but were never marketed. Aqueous solutions of water-insoluble steroids were first developed via association with colloid solubility enhancers in the 1940s. An aqueous solution of progesterone for use by intravenous injection was marketed by Schering AG under the brand name Primolut Intravenous by 1962. One of its intended uses was the treatment of threatened abortion, in which rapid-acting effect was desirable. An aqueous solution of progesterone complexed with cyclodextrin to increase its water solubility was introduced for use by once-daily subcutaneous injection in Europe under the brand name Prolutex in the mid-2010s. In the 1950s, long- acting parenteral progestins such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and norethisterone enanthate were developed and introduced for use by intramuscular injection. They lacked the need for frequent injections and the injection site reactions associated with progesterone by intramuscular injection and soon supplanted progesterone for parenteral therapy in most cases. =Oral and sublingual= The first study of oral progesterone in humans was published in 1949. It found that oral progesterone produced significant progestational effects in the endometrium in women. Prior to this study, animal research had suggested that oral progesterone was inactive, and for this reason, oral progesterone had never been evaluated in humans. A variety of other early studies of oral progesterone in humans were also published in the 1950s and 1960s. These studies generally reported oral progesterone to be only very weakly active. Oral non-micronized progesterone was introduced as a pharmaceutical medication around 1953, for instance as Cyclogesterin (1 mg estrogenic substances and 30 mg progesterone tablets) for menstrual disturbances by Upjohn, though it saw limited use. Another preparation, which contained progesterone alone, was Synderone (trademark registered by Chemical Specialties in 1952). Sublingual progesterone in women was first studied in 1944 by Robert Greenblatt. Buccal progesterone tablets were marketed by Schering under the brand name Proluton Buccal Tablets by 1949. Sublingual progesterone tablets were marketed under the brand names Progesterone Lingusorbs and Progesterone Membrettes by 1951. A sublingual tablet formulation of progesterone has been approved under the brand name Luteina in Poland and Ukraine and remains marketed today. Progesterone was the first progestogen that was found to inhibit ovulation, both in animals and in women. Injections of progesterone were first shown to inhibit ovulation in animals between 1937 and 1939. Inhibition of fertilization by administration of progesterone during the luteal phase was also demonstrated in animals between 1947 and 1949. Ovulation inhibition by progesterone in animals was subsequently re-confirmed and expanded on by Gregory Pincus and colleagues in 1953 and 1954. Findings on inhibition of ovulation by progesterone in women were first presented at the Fifth International Conference on Planned Parenthood in Tokyo, Japan in October 1955. Three different research groups presented their findings on this topic at the conference. They included Pincus (in conjunction with John Rock, who did not attend the conference); a nine-member Japanese group led by Masaomi Ishikawa; and the two-member team of Abraham Stone and Herbert Kupperman. The conference marked the beginning of a new era in the history of birth control. The results were subsequently published in scientific journals in 1956 in the case of Pincus and in 1957 in the case of Ishikawa and colleagues. Rock and Pincus also subsequently described findings from 1952 that \\"pseudopregnancy\\" therapy with a combination of high doses of diethylstilbestrol and oral progesterone prevented ovulation and pregnancy in women. Unfortunately, the use of oral progesterone as a hormonal contraceptive was plagued by problems. These included the large and by extension expensive doses required, incomplete inhibition of ovulation even at high doses, and a frequent incidence of breakthrough bleeding. At the 1955 Tokyo conference, Pincus had also presented the first findings of ovulation inhibition by oral progestins in animals, specifically 19-nortestosterone derivatives like noretynodrel and norethisterone. These progestins were far more potent than progesterone, requiring much smaller doses orally. By December 1955, inhibition of ovulation by oral noretynodrel and norethisterone had been demonstrated in women. These findings as well as results in animals were published in 1956. Noretynodrel and norethisterone did not show the problems associated with oral progesterone‚Äîin the studies, they fully inhibited ovulation and did not produce menstruation-related side effects. Consequently, oral progesterone was abandoned as a hormonal contraceptive in women. The first birth control pills to be introduced were a noretynodrel-containing product in 1957 and a norethisterone-containing product in 1963, followed by numerous others containing a diversity of progestins. Progesterone itself has never been introduced for use in birth control pills. More modern clinical studies of oral progesterone demonstrating elevated levels of progesterone and end-organ responses in women, specifically progestational endometrial changes, were published between 1980 and 1983. Up to this point, many clinicians and researchers apparently still thought that oral progesterone was inactive. It was not until almost half a century after the introduction of progesterone in medicine that a reasonably effective oral formulation of progesterone was marketed. Micronization of progesterone and suspension in oil-filled capsules, which allowed progesterone to be absorbed several-fold more efficiently by the oral route, was first studied in the late 1970s and described in literature in 1982. This formulation, known as oral micronized progesterone (OMP), was then introduced for medical use under the brand name Utrogestan in France in 1982. Subsequently, oral micronized progesterone was introduced under the brand name Prometrium in the United States in 1998. By 1999, oral micronized progesterone had been marketed in more than 35 countries. In 2019, the first combination of oral estradiol and progesterone was introduced under the brand name Bijuva in the United States. A sustained-release (SR) formulation of oral micronized progesterone, also known as \\"oral natural micronized progesterone sustained release\\" or \\"oral NMP SR\\", was marketed in India in 2012 under the brand name Gestofit SR. Many additional brand names followed. The preparation was originally developed in 1986 by a compounding pharmacy called Madison Pharmacy Associates in Madison, Wisconsin in the United States. =Vaginal, rectal, and uterine= Vaginal progesterone suppositories were first studied in women by Robert Greenblatt in 1954. Shortly thereafter, vaginal progesterone suppositories were introduced for medical use under the brand name Colprosterone in 1955. Rectal progesterone suppositories were first studied in men and women by Christian Hamburger in 1965. Vaginal and rectal progesterone suppositories were introduced for use under the brand name Cyclogest by 1976. Vaginal micronized progesterone gels and capsules were introduced for medical use under brand names such as Utrogestan and Crinone in the early 1990s. Progesterone was approved in the United States as a vaginal gel in 1997 and as a vaginal insert in 2007. A progesterone contraceptive vaginal ring known as Progering was first studied in women in 1985 and continued to be researched through the 1990s. It was approved for use as a contraceptive in lactating mothers in Latin America by 2004. A second progesterone vaginal ring known as Fertiring was developed as a progesterone supplement for use during assisted reproduction and was approved in Latin America by 2007. Development of a progesterone-containing intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception began in the 1960s. Incorporation of progesterone into IUDs was initially studied to help reduce the risk of IUD expulsion. However, while addition of progesterone to IUDs showed no benefit on expulsion rates, it was unexpectedly found to induce endometrial atrophy. This led in 1976 to the development and introduction of Progestasert, a progesterone-containing product and the first progestogen-containing IUD. Unfortunately, the product had various problems that limited its use. These included a short duration of efficacy of only one year, a high cost, a relatively high 2.9% failure rate, a lack of protection against ectopic pregnancy, and difficult and sometimes painful insertions that could necessitate use of a local anesthetic or analgesic. As a result of these issues, Progestasert never became widely used, and was discontinued in 2001. It was used mostly in the United States and France while it was marketed. =Transdermal and topical= A topical gel formulation of progesterone, for direct application to the breasts as a local therapy for breast disorders such as breast pain, was introduced under the brand name Progestogel in Europe by 1972. No transdermal formulations of progesterone for systemic use have been successfully marketed, in spite of efforts of pharmaceutical companies towards this goal. The low potency of transdermal progesterone has thus far precluded it as a possibility. Although no formulations of transdermal progesterone are approved for systemic use, transdermal progesterone is available in the form of creams and gels from custom compounding pharmacies in some countries, and is also available over-the-counter without a prescription in the United States. However, these preparations are unregulated and have not been adequately characterized, with low and unsubstantiated effectiveness. Society and culture =Generic names= Progesterone is the generic name of the drug in English and its , , , , , and , while progest√©rone is its name in French and its .

An oral combination formulation of micronized progesterone and estradiol in oil-filled capsules (brand name Bijuva) is marketed in the United States for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and endometrial hyperplasia. Progesterone is also available in unregulated custom preparations from compounding pharmacies in the United States. In addition, transdermal progesterone is available over-the-counter in the United States, although the clinical efficacy of transdermal progesterone is controversial. Research Progesterone was studied as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive, but was never marketed. Combinations of estradiol and progesterone as a macrocrystalline aqueous suspension and as an aqueous suspension of microspheres have been studied as once-a-month combined injectable contraceptives, but were likewise never marketed. Progesterone has been assessed for the suppression of sex drive and spermatogenesis in men. In one study, 100 mg rectal suppositories of progesterone given five times per day for 9 days resulted in progesterone levels of 5.5 to 29 ng/mL and suppressed circulating testosterone and growth hormone levels by about 50% in men, but did not affect libido or erectile potency in this short treatment period. In other studies, 50 mg/day progesterone by intramuscular injection for 10 weeks in men produced azoospermia, decreased testicular size, markedly suppressed libido and erectile potency, and resulted in minimal semen volume upon ejaculation. An oil and water nanoemulsion of progesterone (particles of <1 mm in diameter) using micellar nanoparticle technology for transdermal administration known as Progestsorb NE was under development by Novavax for use in menopausal hormone therapy in the 2000s.https://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800017094https://web.archive.org/web/20191222045252/https://ir.novavax.com/static- files/af4f0b93-c3f2-442b-9da5-f3ee0c63f844 However, development was discontinued in 2007 and the formulation was never marketed.

It was primarily fighting against the Turkish military intervention in Syria, although it was also opposed to various Islamist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The launch was announced on 6 September 2016 by Rezan Hedo, the head of the group‚Äôs political bureau. At that time Hedo was also an independent member of the Syrian Democratic Council.  History  The emblem of the Kafr Saghir Martyrs Brigade, which uses the coat of arms of Syria as basis. The Syrian National Resistance was officially founded on 6 September 2016 in the SDF-controlled town of Tell Rifaat, and by 12 September, the SNR already claimed to have set up offices in Aleppo, Idlib, Homs, Latakia, and other Syrian cities. On the other side, the Kafr Saghir Martyrs Brigade (Liwa Shuhada Kafr Saghir), which would eventually become the basis for the SNR's armed wing, emerged around late October when ISIL was driven from Kafr Saghir and the nearby Aleppo Infantry School north- east of Aleppo. The unit, which has been described as \\"a predominately Kurdish pro-government unit\\" and \\"officially neutral force for local protection between (the Syrian) regime and the SDF\\", was initially composed of around 50 volunteers and only lightly armed. The Kafr Saghir Martyrs Brigade joined the SNR sometime in November; later that month, the SNR entered the Battle of al- Bab together with the Syrian Army (SAA) to prevent Turkish-led rebel militias from conquering al-Bab. On 19 February 2017, SNR leader Rezan Hedo announced the party was ceasing activities, citing lack of understanding between the Syrian government and the SDF. The status of the Kafr Saghir Martyrs Brigade is unclear.  Ideology  The Syrian National Resistance was expressly Syrian nationalist and strongly opposed to the Turkish government, having accused Turkey of conducting a genocide against Syrian Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians and Chaldeans in Aleppo Governorate, attempting to conquer parts of Syria, and aiding terrorism. The SNR also expressed as one of its aims to retake Turkey's Hatay Province, which was annexed from Syria in 1939. Despite this, the group claimed it was unopposed to the Turkish people in general, and that it desired peaceful coexistence with the Turkish state in the long term. Furthermore, the SNR was strongly opposed to the Al-Nusra Front as well as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, having declared its intention to drive them from Syria. The SNR followed a pan-ethnic brand of Syrian nationalism, and reportedly had Arab, Kurdish, Assyrian and Turkmen members; it wished to ensure Syria's future as united, integrated, and democratic state. The Syrian National Resistance was allied both to the Syrian Armed Forces as well as the SDF, having been declared \\"a key player in improving regional relations between the SAA and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)\\". Nevertheless, the SNR denied a direct affiliation to either faction. Rezan Hedo has stated that he counts on the support of both loyalists as well as opponents to the Ba'athist government, and that the SNR has \\"nothing to do\\" with the PYD, TEV-DEM, YPG, and PKK.

The membranous urethra is most likely to be injured in pelvic fractures, allowing urine and blood to enter the deep perineal space and subperitoneal spaces via the genital hiatus. The spongy urethra is most likely to be injured with a catheter or in a straddle injury, allowing urine and blood to escape into the scrotum, the penis, and the superficial peritoneal space.

Biography  St√©phane Hoffmann was sent to the Jesuits at Saint-Fran√ßois-Xavier in Vannes for ten years, then to the Fr√®res de Plo√´rmel at the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis in Saint-Nazaire. After he studied in hypokh√¢gne at lyc√©e Janson-de-Sailly in Paris, and although admitted in kh√¢gne, he preferred to continue history and law studies in 1977 at the Paris-Sorbonne University and the Panth√©on-Assas University. He finished them with a bachelor's degree in history (1980) and a master's degree in private law, obtained in 1983 in Nantes, where he lived from 1980 to 1992. After three days working as a chronicler in the radios of Nantes, he organized \\"Les mardis nantais\\" between 1983 and 1987, evenings where he would received some writers, including F√©licien Marceau, Bernard-Henri L√©vy, Jean d'Ormesson, R√©gine Deforges, H√©l√®ne Carr√®re d'Encausse, and Genevi√®ve Dormann. The publication of his first novel in 1989 opened him the doors of Le Figaro Magazine, where he published his first article on the history of the sandwich in 1990. He wrote a few hundred more on books, actresses, cigars and the best way to polish one's shoes. Since March 2013, he holds a television critic's column: \\"La vision t√©l√© de St√©phane Hoffmann\\". Having lived from 1992 to 2002 in four arrondissements of Paris (15th, 6th, 9th, 7th), he settled in La Douett√©e, a hamlet on the banks of the Isac, on the outskirts of the in Loire-Atlantique.

He is currently the Stephen B. Kay Family Professor of Public Health and the chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  Early life and education  Hofman was born in 1951 in Hardenberg, The Netherlands. He attended medical school at the University of Groningen and graduated in 1976 with his MD. He went on to complete a second research fellowship within the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1982. He then completed his PhD at the Erasmus University of Rotterdam in 1983. His research fellowship was completed within the department of community medicine at the University of Groningen, 1975; and his clinical residencies were completed in the departments of internal medicine at the Academic Hospitals Groningen and Leiden in 1977.  Career  Dr. Albert Hofman In 1981 he became an assistant professor at Erasmus University Medical School, Rotterdam; he was promoted to associate professor in 1984, and to full professor in 1988. In 1988 he became chairman of the department of epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands, in which he served until 2016. He also served as the science director of the graduate school of the Netherlands Institute for Health Sciences (NIHES) since its inception in 1992 to 2015. Hofman has served as the editor-in-chief of the European Journal of Epidemiology since 2000. Hofman is the initiator and principal investigator of two population-based, prospective cohort studies in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands: the Rotterdam Study and the Generation R study. Data collection for these studies started in 1990 and 2002, respectively. These cohort studies both target multiple common diseases, have very extensive and state-of-the-art assessments of the putative determinants of these diseases, and employ many new technologies not previously applied to epidemiologic population studies. The study of multiple outcomes, in particular of neurological, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases, has enabled the investigation of the interrelations of diseases, and thereby of the co- morbidity and co-etiology of various diseases with a large population burden. This has made the findings in these studies generally useful for public health purposes, as well as for clinical medicine. These studies included the first use of genome-wide assessment and large-scale imaging of whole cohorts in epidemiological studies. The Rotterdam Study was one of the five founding cohorts of the very productive CHARGE consortium which has performed many successful genome-wide association studies that have found a large number of genes associated with common diseases. The Rotterdam Study has also pioneered new population imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging since 1995. In addition to contributing to over 2,000 publications during his career, he is also the faculty director of the clinical epidemiology program within the department of epidemiology at the Harvard Chan School.

Family Arthur Townshend Boscawen was born in Hanover Square, London, the ninth of twelve children of the Rev Hon John Townshend Boscawen (1820‚Äì1889) and Mary Tremayne (died 25 November 1895), the daughter of John Hearle Tremayne MP for Cornwall and owner of the Heligan estate, near Mevagissey. His father was the Rector of Lamorran, a keen gardener of (it was said) one of the finest gardens in Cornwall. His uncle was Evelyn Boscawen, 6th Viscount Falmouth who was developing the garden on his estate at Tregothnan. Boscawen married at St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, on 2 September 1902, Christian Anna E Chapell-Hodge (1866‚Äì 13 November 1940), eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs Chapell- Hodge of Plymouth. They had two daughters: # Violet Mary Boscawen (12 June 1903 ‚Äì 7 January 1998) # Karenza Margaret Boscawen (11 November 1904 ‚Äì 22 April 1977) ‚Äì a cultivar of the daffodil, 'Karenza' was named for her. Career He initially considered the army for a career but opted for the church, and following a short period working in the Diocese of Bristol he was based at Buckland Monachorum, Devon for five years before moving to Ludgvan in 1893. In 1917 Boscawen had the rank of Temporary Chaplain to the Forces, of the 1st Battalion, Cornwall Volunteers Regiment. In 1933 he was appointed canon of Truro Cathedral and was also a Justice of the Peace. =Gardening= The garden of the Rectory, in Ludgvan, was first laid out by William Borlase when he was the rector in 1722. He planned to grow exotic species sent to him by his uncle who was a captain in the service of the East India Company in Bengal, India. Boscawen had similar plans and was sent trees and shrubs from New Zealand. Material for the garden was provided by some of New Zealand's botanists, including Thomas Cheeseman, and by his eldest brother, John Hugh Boscawen who was employed by the New Zealand Forest Service. There was also a network between local gardens and gardeners with the transfer of plants and seeds. These included Arthur Dorrien-Smith's garden at Tresco, Morrab Gardens and Penlee Park in Penzance and Eagles Nest, Zennor. Little of the original garden survives, the three winters of 1938, 1939 and 1940 were severe and many of the more tender trees and shrubs were killed, although some of the planting remains including the palms (Trachycarpus fortunei), the tallest measuring tall. Boscawen did not leave a list of his plantings but research by Anne Boscawen shows that there were 290 acquisitions of plants. Boscawen also introduced many new plants to the botanical garden at Tregothnan. Horticulture Boscawen spent much of his time on the propagation of shrubs from cuttings and seeds. In 1912 he was awarded a Gold Medal and The Gardeners' Chronicle Cup for New Plants for varieties of New Zealand manukas' (Leptospermum scoparium var Nichollsii). A variety of daffodil was named, ‚Ä≥Karenza (Cornish for love) was named after his second daughter and a second variety was named ‚Ä≥Ludgvan‚Ä≥. Both varieties appear to be no longer available. It is thought that Boscawen collected seeds of Anemome while on holiday in the Mediterranean and in 1925 gave of white, woolly seeds to the nearby Gulval Experimental Station. The first commercial crop was despatched to Covent Garden which filled a gap in the farming year between cauliflower and narcissi. Cauliflower is known as broccoli in Cornwall and he helped local production by introducing seed from Bavaria, to improve the local varieties. He was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour in 1922 by the Royal Horticultural Society. Death Arthur Townsend Boscawen died 17 July 1939 at the Rectory and is buried at the Church of St Paul, Ludgvan. There is a monument to him inside the church.

A Coalition force of Russians and Bavarians under generals Eugen of Wurtemberg and Carl Philipp von Wrede was defeated by a French force under general Joseph Lagrange, which managed to destroy the town's bridge and prevent the Coalition force crossing the river Aube. Course After the battle of La Rothi√®re on 1 February 1814, Napoleon ordered a retreat towards Troyes and placed some of Michel Ney's troops as well as Joseph Lagrange's division from marshal Marmont's corps as his rearguard. The French army crossed the bridge at Lesmont on the night of 2 February protected by troops under Ney's command, who then retired. Lagrange's division remained in the village to cover the retreat and took up position on the right bank of the river behind the bridge. It was soon attacked by Eugen's cavalry and elements of von Wrede's corps. Lagrange's division managed to hold its central position against several attacks, especially by Eugen's Russian cavalry. At the end of the battle the French troops set fire to the bridge and rejoined the main retreating force. The loss of the bridge meant that the Coalition cavalry lost contact with the French troops, which reached Troyes the following day without incident.

Until July 2018, she was a co- chair of the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), an umbrella organisation of secular, democratic, opposition in Syria that acts as the legislature of the AANES. Ehmed is a member of the executive committee of the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV-DEM) coalition.  Political career  Ehmed is particularly outspoken on the aim of a programmatically polyethnic character of a future Syria. At the start of the Northern Raqqa offensive in November 2016, she was quoted saying that \\"such an administration could provide a good example for democratic change in Raqqa, especially that the city has been for years a de facto capital for the ISIS terrorist group. This accomplishment would be a major change in the overall situation in Syria, and would help the country move towards stability, democratic change. Raqqa will be an example for the whole country.\\" She took part in negotiations with the Syrian Government in Damascus concerning services that shall be provided also in the areas governed by the SDC in July 2018. Along with this, she is also a member of the Syrian Women's Initiative for Peace and Democracy. She has been fighting in the struggle for Kurdish freedom since the 1990s. Her main goal as Executive President of the Syrian Democratic Council is to have a decentralized state. In this decentralized state she pushes for local civilian councils and governments that guarantee the rights of different Syrian groups. This includes the freedom of expression, gender equality, etc. She also wants the rights of the Kurdish people to be guaranteed in the Syrian Constitution. = Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria = Before the Turkish invasion, Afrin was one of the most stable and peaceful regions of Syria. After US President Donald Trump declared that the United States would withdraw its troops from the territories governed by the SDC in December 2018, and Turkey threatened to attack, she travelled to Paris with SDC co-chair Riad Darar to talk with the French government about further cooperation with the French troops stationed in the areas governed by the SDC. This left √élham Ehmed and the SDC vulnerable to an attack from Turkey on Northeastern Syria. The SDC would be prone to attack from Turkey because the belief of Syrian ties to the People's Protection Units (YPG), which has ties to the Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK). Ahmed says, ‚ÄúBecause Turkey is a NATO state, they (Turkish government) designated the PKK as a terrorist organization.‚Äù She finishes by saying that, ‚ÄúThe PKK never targeted the interests of the United States or any other NATO country and it is only an issue for Turkey.‚Äù This means that when the United States withdraws its troops Turkey no longer has any allied governments standing in its way of attacking the SDC; As they consider them terrorists because of the belief that the SDC supports the PKK. This invasion also is susceptible to ethnic cleansing as the belief links the SDC and PKK to the Kurds. According to Ahmed not only will the Turks be attacking the Kurds, but there are other ethnicities in the area including Syriacs, Arabs, and Christians. She evens says that these people are the majority in the area. After negotiations with the French Government, French troops ended up staying in Syria. October 2019 was the second time that President Trump ordered troops to withdraw from Syria. Following Turkey invaded Rojava and 250 people were killed and over 130,000 displaced. Many of those that were displaced had to leave their ancestral homes. This occurred despite a cease-fire was made between the Turks and Kurds backed by the United States and Russia. According to Ahmed the Turks were not following the cease-fire as there were some leaked videos that show the Syrian National Army mutilating a body of a Kurdish fighter. Along with this she says that some have leadership from the Islamic State that the SDC worked hard to eliminate with American help. Turkey has also violated humanitarian rights by the Ahrar al-Sharqiya militia, which Turkish forces back, brutally murdering Hevrin Khalaf. She was a Kurdish politician who was traveling along route M4. Her body was found with dozens of bullet holes, lacerations, and her skin was detached from her scalp when she was dragged by her hair from the car. The cease-fire did however calm the invasion of Turkey and left time for them to think about the American troops that have entered back into Northern Syria. The cease-fire also brought up the question of possibly putting 200 troops back into eastern Syria to protect oil fields. Also this happened to prevent the Islamic State from reentering the territories that were recently taken.  Ties With the United States  As discussed in the previous section √élham Ehmed also has some issues with the White House, as Trump has been withdrawing and reentering troops somewhat frequently. As this has happened twice in the last ten months, she has become wary of United States assistance militarily. Since the battle against the Islamic State has started the Ehmed and the SDC has lost 11,000 men and 24,000 have been wounded. With the withdrawal of American troops and the bloodshed because of this, Ehmed has called upon the United States to help once again. She asks that the United States: * Stop the Turkish aggression on North and East Syria. * Stop the Turkish genocide against the people of North and East Syria. * Impose immediate, substantial sanctions on Turkey. * Exercise all diplomatic pressures that could deter the Turkish aggression. * Deploy international peacekeepers along the border with Turkey. * Suspend Article 5 of NATO charter regarding the Turkish intervention in North and East Syria. * Restore the International Coalition's control over the airspace in North and East Syria to prevent Turkey from bombing the region. * Impose a no fly-zone. * Send international observers to document the violations committed by Turkish army and the so-called \\"National Army\\" and assess the humanitarian situation resulting from the Turkish invasion.

It originated on the west side of Glasgow at an intersection running concurrently with U.S. Route 68 (US 68) and KY 80, and ended at an intersection with US 31E on the north side of town. History The KY 3160 designation was first assigned to a secondary route in Hardin County. It traveled along Logsdon Parkway from KY 1500 to KY 313 in Radcliff. That was re-designated as part of KY 1646 on February 1, 1988, when the old route of KY 1646 along Shelton Road was given to the city of Radcliff. In the early 2000s, the construction of the Veterans Outer Loop near Glasgow, in Barren County, began with a stretch of road connecting with US 68 on the west side of Glasgow to US 31E on the north side. It was completed in 2004, and it was designated as KY 3160. In the 2010/11 fiscal year, the Veterans Outer Loop was extended eastward to make a complete bypass around the city. When it was completed in 2012, US 68 was re-routed onto the Veterans Outer Loop, while the existing US 68 alignment was re-designated as US 68 Business.

She recorded a total of 21 tracks between 1926 and 1935. Unusually for a female blues performer at the time, Robinson composed some of her songs. Details of her life outside the recording studio are sketchy. Life and career Edwards was probably born in Katy, Texas, and raised in Houston. Although Edwards was not directly related to them, she grew up with a musical family, which included Beulah Belle, George, Hociel and Hersal Thomas. During her time with them she learned to play the piano. In 1923, she relocated along with George and Hersal Thomas to Chicago, Illinois. Five years later, at two separate recording sessions in February and November 1928, Edwards recorded twelve songs for Paramount Records, which included \\"Moaning Blues\\". This title may have led to her being sometimes billed as \\"Moanin' Bernice (Edwards)\\". She accompanied herself while singing the mainly slow blues songs, which also included her version of \\"Long Tall Mama.\\" Her common theme was of the \\"lowlife\\" and mean men, typified by the aforementioned plus \\"Mean Man Blues\\" and \\"Hard Hustling Blues.\\" Some of her early recordings were released under the name Bernice Duke. In 1935, Edwards returned to the recording studio, this time in Fort Worth, Texas for American Record Corporation. Alongside Black Boy Shine, she recorded piano duets including one entitled \\"Hot Mattress Stomp\\". The recording included some guitar playing by J. T. \\"Funny Papa\\" Smith. Her own piano playing had also gained in dynamics since her first visit to a recording studio. Her self- penned track \\"Butcher Shop Blues\\" (1935), extended the analogy of meat for sexual innuendo, although her vocals on it appeared to be less strong and expressive. Following the Fort Worth session, Edwards apparently got married and joined the church, after which nothing much more is known of her life. According to researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc, she died in Hermann Hospital in Houston in 1969, aged about 62. Her work is included on various compilation albums.

Early life Born in Chicago, Illinois she made many trips to Lake Michigan where her passion for geology began.Whitmore, Frank C., Jr. 1990. Memorial to Esther Aberdeen Holm, 1904-1984. In: Memorial Volume. Geological Society of America. pp.9-12. Through encouragement from her mother, she was able to support herself through her years attending Northwestern University by working as a stenographer for an advertising company. She married in August 15, 1953 to Donald August Holm who she met while working in Algiers. At the time, she traveled to Saudi Arabia where she grew fond of Arabian horses and brought several of them to Arizona. Education Holm was hired as a physical education instructor at the YWCA in St. Joseph, Michigan for only a year after her graduation in 1928, before returning to Northwestern University where she had obtained her master's degree in science. After which, she carried on at the institution as a tutor before she entered graduate school at the University of Chicago in 1933, studying only for a year before she postponed her studies to work as a geology instructor at Milwaukee-Downer College for one more year. In 1937 Holm received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago with a major in paleontology.  Career  Five years after receiving her Ph.D (1942), she changed her career from being an assistant professor at Wellesley College to being involved in terrain interpretation and preparation of applied geologic maps for the Military Geology Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey. A short two years later (1944), Esther wrote a section on the roads of Mindanao. She was a part of the Military Geology Unit which did an immense amount of work during WW2 producing maps of inaccessible foreign areas. From 1946-1948, Esther made geological contributions toward the war effort, outlined below. Esther went to the 19th International Geological Congress in Algiers in 1952, where she met her soon to be husband Donald Holm who was a geologist. During her stay in Algiers, Esther taught Economic Geography to a variety of people. Esther's contribution to the study of diatoms and Radiolaria was included in the Treatise on Ecology and Paleoecology in 1957. Always finding things to contribute to, she transferred from Washington to Flagstaff, AZ in 1965 to the Branch of Astrology contributed to the program of studies of the lunar equatorial zone Finally retiring in 1971, Esther received the highest award of the Interior Department, the Distinguished Service Medal.  War Contributions  Esther Holm was a part of the Military Geology Unit which did an immense amount of work during WW2 producing maps of inaccessible foreign areas.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr. 1990. Memorial to Esther Aberdeen Holm, 1904-1984. In: Memorial Volume. Geological Society of America. pp.9-12. At the time, maps were needed to show ‚Äúconstruction materials and water supplies...track cross-country movement‚Äù and detect underground installations (p. 9). With Charles B. Hunt's influence, she created a fast-paced system that allowed interpretation of map data by looking at ‚Äúexpanded map legends and tables‚Äù(p. 9). Through the years 1946-1948, Esther was assigned to field-check the intelligence for Operation Coronet (the invasion of the island of Honshu, Japan) which was to take place on March 1, 1946 She completed a series of terrain-intelligence field checks and then played a key role in the beginning of the Pacific Island Mapping Program. She made several trips to Okinawa and one to Palau. She proved to be a first-class staff officer. The end result of her efforts was a ‚ÄúStrategic Engineering Study‚Äù for army operatives that were still used after the second world war (p. 9). Following the war, her technology was applied to fields such as ‚Äúengineering geology, environmental studies, and planetary geology‚Äù(p. 9). Contributions to Modern Geological Science Holm has made numerous contributions to not only the field of geology, but to the entire discipline of biological sciences. These contributions focus on disambiguating the relationship between fossilized Radiolaria and the deposition of sediments in deep-sea environments. Holm explicates these findings in the Treatise on Marine Ecology and Paleoecology, delineating the nature of Radiolaria, as well as disambiguating the nature of the relationship between Fossilized Radiolaria and sedimentary deposition. Specifically, Holm purported that fossilized Radiolaria exhibits two principle conditions which result in such fossils creating a significant contribution to marine sediment. These two conditions are: Radiolaria are not subject to decomposition when sinking towards the ocean floor; and, Fossilized Radiolaria are not hidden by additional sedimentary material. Additionally, Holm explicated the ancient environments which supported populations of Radiolaria, subsequently providing several accounts of how Radiolaria fossilized in a myriad of different types and ages of rocks. All of these findings serve to augment the general understanding of how ancient biological factors and circumstances have impacted contemporary geological findings, most saliently being the deposition of marine sediments. While Holm's was in the Military Geology Branch, she was able to do significant research and write plenty of reports for the Corps of Engineers. Following a career that was heavily dictated by war, Holm's wrote very few papers that went unpublished. She turned her focus to applied geology and astrology specializing and providing information about the lunar landscape and lunar terrain mapping. With her knowledge in terrain analysis, she did research on the area that is presumed to be most suitable for manned and unmanned landings. Holm's research played a role in studying river deltas. Her ideas were the basis on classifying the features of deltas.

As distinguished colonial Latin American historian John J. TePaske put it in 1968, \\"At least three generations of graduate students have studied the works of Lillian Estelle Fisher.\\"John J. TePaske, \\"Review of The Last Inca Revolt, 1780‚Äì1783\\", The Hispanic American Historical Review vol. 48 (no. 3), August 1968 499‚Äì500.

Early life Fisher was born in Pennsylvania to farmers George P. Fisher and Etta R. Fisher in 1891. She attended Susquehanna University for her B.A., earning highest honors in 1912. She briefly taught at a Methodist normal school (teacher-education training school) in Puebla, Mexico (1913‚Äì1916). Fisher moved to California and earned her M.A. at the University of Southern California in 1918, then attended the University of California, Berkeley for her doctorate, which she completed in 1924 under Herbert I. Priestley. She remained for a time in California, teaching at Whittier College. She taught for 15 years at the Oklahoma College for Women (1926‚Äì1942), and returned to Berkeley, where she taught for a time at the extension of the University of California. As Fisher was one a very small number of women earning doctorates in history, her mentor was concerned that as a woman she would face discrimination in the field; however, Priestley did not support the entrance of women in major history departments.Helen Delpar, Looking South: Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850‚Äì1975. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 2008, p. 49. Academic career In keeping with the intellectual trends in Latin American history at the time, Fisher pursued institutional history, with one work on the viceregal administration and the other on the eighteenth-century Bourbon reforms establishing the intendancy system. In 1955, she published the first full-length biography of reform bishop-elect of Michoacan, Manuel Abad y Queipo. This remains the main work on this important figure of the late colonial period in Mexico. She also wrote a monograph on the background to Mexican independence, and her research on Masons in that era continues to be cited. She also wrote an important early article on women in the Mexican Revolution, \\"The Influence of the Present Mexican Revolution on the Status of Women,\\"The Hispanic American Historical Review vol. 22, No. 1 (Feb. 1942), pp. 228 which has been included in an anthology on women in Latin American history.Gertrude M. Yeager, ed. Confronting Change, Challenging Tradition: Women in Latin American History. Lanham MD: SR Books 2005. Her final monograph on the Tupac Amaru revolt was published in 1966, when she was 75.

Under the Public Land Survey System, he was surveyor-general for the Northwest Territories and as such, assisted or led \\"in many of the government's original surveys of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana,\\" and especially in Michigan. Early life Mullett was born to a large family in Halifax, Vermont on July 11, 1786. In 1807, the family moved to Genesee County, New York and dabbled in farming and the craft of tailoring. Mullett served as an officer in the War of 1812, but only saw action in the Battle of Buffalo. Col. Mullett came to Detroit from Buffalo, New York in 1818, and moved from tailoring to mathematics and surveying.  Notable accomplishments  * In 1821, Lewis Cass appointed him surveyor of Michigan. * In 1822, he surveyed the route from Pontiac, Michigan to Saginaw, Michigan. * In 1822, Edward Tiffin appointed him United States Deputy Surveyor, and he was engaged in surveying public lands until 1849. * In 1824/25 surveys of lower Michigan, the survey team he was leading had a small incident with Native Americans over the marking of trees the natives were using for making maple syrup. This \\"battle\\" became the origin of the name of Battle Creek, Michigan. * Mullet surveyed the plank road between Detroit and Grand Rapids * In 1825, Mullet was among the first white settlers in Climax, Michigan * In 1828, Mullet published a survey of private property claims on Mackinaw Island. * In 1829-1830 Mullett surveyed Southwest Michigan including the area around Niles, Michigan. * Following his 1830 \\"Plan of Detroit\\" survey, he had two roads in Detroit named after him: Mullet Street (1835) and Catherine Street (1835). * Improving on Hervey Coke Parke's 1827 survey, Mullett surveyed the final route through the swamp between Detroit and Fort Gratiot in 1831. * From 1831 to 1834 he surveyed in Wisconsin. His efforts to survey the Fox River and Wisconsin River in Wisconsin were ultimately driven out of Wisconsin by the Black Hawk War. * Along with surveyors William Austin Burt and Charles W. Cathcart, he surveyed much of Northern Michigan between 1840 and 1843. Mullet became the namesake of Mullett Township, Michigan and Mullett Lake in Northern Michigan, while Burt named Burt Lake after himself. * In 1843, 1844, and 1845, Mullett was elected Grand Master of Michigan's Masonic Grand Lodge that met in Detroit. Later life In 1849, he moved with his family to a farm near Williamston in Ingham County. He had a large family, and his family papers are in the University of Michigan Library. Mullet's Son in Law Frank Hall died in the 1860 PS Lady Elgin disaster.

They are commonly employed where pest control is needed: in barns, farms, factories, warehouses, stores, churchyards, and private property. A benefit of using a working cat is that they alleviate the need for harmful pesticides. Working cats are often placed in their environment as a part of a working cats program. The resident cat at the British Prime Minister's home at 10 Downing Street has been given the title Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office.  Working cats programs  A working cats program is designed to place cats in safe environments where they are valued for their hunting skills as working cats. These programs are typically offered by animal shelters who will use otherwise unadoptable cats in the program as an alternative to euthanasia. The cats may not be suitable for adoption because they are feral cats or did not acclimate to living in close quarters with humans. Working cats programs usually provide cats that are spayed or neutered and fully vaccinated, and any adoption fee is often waived. In exchange for their services, the cats are to receive a place to live, food, water, and vet care.  Feral Cats  A feral cat is a cat without an owner that lives outside. These cats have very minimal to no human contact at all. They tend to hide from humans and do not allow themselves to be touched by them. Attempts to socialize feral cats often fail or take a long time, and even so some remain afraid of humans. There are efforts to control the feral cat population, which is a big problem. There are trap neuter return programs, which capture the feral cats, neuter/spay them, and release them back outside. This prevents the cat from reproducing. Others result in euthanasia.  Pros  Each year, about 1.5 million shelter animals are put down, and 860,000 of those are cats.https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and- surrender/pet-statistics Working cat programs decrease those numbers by giving a cat that would instead not be adoptable a home, and more room for other shelter animals. A study that was done at the University of Minnesota showed that taking care of a cat can improve human health. The study showed fewer chances of getting heart attacks, cardiovascular diseases, having trouble sleeping, and anxiety when caring for a cat. There are also benefits for the community. Feral cats control the population of rodents in a neighborhood, which then negates the need for any harmful pesticides to be used. It also reduces the spread of rabies and fleas since they are vaccinated and their caretakers treat them for fleas. These programs also save tax dollars since they are run by volunteers or privately owned.  Cons  Some disadvantages to feral cats are urine markings and destruction to wildlife and property. Feral cats are wild, and they will continue to act like so even though they have a caretaker. They may also injure other pets that get too close. Another disadvantage is veterinary care. One round of vaccinations is not going to last for the rest of the cat's life. They must eventually get another round. Capturing a feral cat can be difficult, and some caretakers do not care to take the animal to the vet again. If they do not get their vaccinations when they are due, the cats can contract diseases and spread. Cats are three to four times more likely to get rabies than other domestic animals like dogs.

Koller (nicknamed \\"Feemy\\"), to retain possession of land she inherited in 1910 from her late husband, Sam M. Heinbach, in Ilasco. Atlas Portland Cement Company, the major industry in town, wanted to buy the land, which comprised much of the unincorporated town site. After the case reached the Missouri State Supreme Court four times, it resulted in the county probate court placing a guardianship over Heinbach in 1921. It asserted that she was incapable of managing the land. A circuit court judge ordered a sheriff's sale of the land to Atlas Portland Cement Company, which virtually ran the town and had wanted to acquire the property from the beginning of the litigation. Koller tried to overturn the sale and expose the political complexities of the town. In 1927 the court ordered her to be confined to Missouri's State Hospital Number One for the Insane. She was held here until her death at age sixty-eight. Background Mary Alice \\"Mollie\\" Scott, widow of John M.

Koller had acquired considerable legal expertise and acted as an ad hoc attorney as she and her sister litigated this case with hired male attorneys.

Housing over 2 million books, academic journals and electronic resources, including 52,000 e-journal subscriptions, 443,000 e-books, and over 800 databases, the library has more than 2 million visitors each year. The library offers tutoring and writing services, laptops, a career resource center, and course reserves. The facility houses several special and digital collections, including literature, oral histories, photographs, artifacts, and the university archives.  History  In 1958, the foundations were poured for the original four buildings that would become the core of the USF master plan. These included the maintenance facility, administrative-classroom building, union-classroom-cafeteria, and the library. When John S. Allen was named the first USF president in 1957, his first academic appointment to the staff was Elliott Hardaway, at the time the assistant librarian at the University of Florida. As USF librarian, Hardaway was charged with building a university library collection from scratch. For the first year of classes, the library was temporarily located in the University Center ballroom until the completed five-story facility opened in 1961. The campus was planned so that the library was the tallest, most conspicuous building, to symbolize what John Allen considered to be the heart of the university. The library was designed accommodate 250,000 books but also housed reading rooms, a permanent art gallery, a faculty lounge and conference rooms. Over the following decade, the USF population grew and a larger library was soon in high-demand. In 1975, the current seven-story, 154,000 square foot building opened with the capacity of up to one million volumes.  SMART lab  Opened in 2012, the Science, Math and Research Technology (SMART) Lab, provides a hands-on learning space which includes more than 300 computer work stations.  Special collections  In addition to wide-ranging electronic and print resources the library provides other primary research materials through Special Collections. These include Florida history and politics, American literature, medieval manuscripts, Latin American Science Fiction, LBGT literature, Holocaust & genocide literature, juvenile literature, rare books, and sheet music. The Library's Florida Studies Center draws on Special Collections materials and technological services to promote arts and humanities education on Florida and its people to students, teachers and the public.  Digital Heritage and Humanities Collections  The DHHC documents heritage sites, landscapes and objects. The DHHC creates digital learning tools to promote heritage tourism. The technologies being used include 3D laser scanners, Nikon DSLR cameras, DJI Phantom and DJI Mavic unmanned aerial vehicles, Agisoft Photoscan Professional, FLIR thermal infrared cameras for imaging. For geo-spatial analysis uses ArcGIS and sends someone to the ESRI conference to make sure the program remains up to date. Some projects include: a 3D survey and imaging of Haghpat Monastery, a terrestrial laser scanning survey of Russell Cave National Monument and a digital tour of Cowpens National Battlefield.  Textbook Affordability Project  Recently, Florida law has required academic institutions to comply with new textbook selection and reporting requirements in order to combat high costs to students. In 2009, the textbook affordability initiative began at USF with a committee survey about awareness of textbook costs. From here, the Textbook Affordability Project (TAP) was created to disperse information to both faculty and students about textbook costs. Currently, the USF Tampa Library facilitates three main activities in order to promote textbook affordability: recommendations to faculty, Course Reserves, and the E-books for the Classroom database. During the early years of TAP, staff was limited to two persons. As of 2018, over 6 full-time staff are dedicated to the Textbook Affordability project. TAP strives to provide affordable textbook options to students, and encourages professors to seek out more affordable options for their courses. *Ebooks for the Classroom+ - As part of its efforts to promote textbook affordability, TAP uses Ebooks for the Classroom to encourage the use of library-licensed resources in courses. This database was created in 2017, and serves the entire USF system. Within the database, professors can adopt Ebooks that the library has purchased rights to, so that students can access these books for free. This collection has contributed greatly to the efforts of the TAP initiative.

Early life and career Sylvan was born Elena Mazzantini in Rome on July 12, 1874. Her parentage is unknown, although it is unlikely that she was born to aristocrats, as was once thought. Little is known about Sylvan's early life and career. It is likely that she studied with well-known actor and acting coach Luigi Rasi in Florence. In 1918, Sylvan announced that she had written two film scripts, presumably for ...Bolscevismo?? and Sovrana.

While this film in not extant, promotional materials show that ...Bolscevismo?? was a morality play set during the Russian Revolution. ...Bolscevismo?? was based loosely on the novel The Flame in the Steppe by Danilo Korsakoff. The film tells the story of sisters Elena and Enelia Morgani, both played by Sylvan. Elena is represented as hardworking and good while Enelia is shown to be disloyal and morally corrupt. Indeed, one pamphlet for the film suggests that Enelia has stolen Elena's husband. Elena, Sylvan's namesake and surrogate in the film, manages workers at a factory in a town called Selenio. A vicious Bolshevik journalist named Zobisant sets out to destroy Elena's personal life and career. Ultimately, Elena defeats Zobisant, leaving him begging for her forgiveness at the end of the film.

Atokolo was commissioned into Ministry with a mandate from God to ‚ÄúUnveil to His people the Mysteries of Redemption and Teach them to do Exploits through Faith‚Äù. That mandate led to the establishment of Word Aflame Assembly now Word Aflame Family Church (WAFC) in 1994. Over the years, other arms of the Ministry have evolved. They include Victor Atokolo Word Outreach(VAWO), Intercede Nigeria, Global Ministers‚Äô Connect, Kheh-sed Bible Training Centre and Campus Aflame Fellowship(CAFEL).  Brexit & Trump Predictions  Atokolo in July 2016 predicted Donald Trump would emerge as new President-Elect of the United States of America. According to him, Trump‚Äôs victory would impede the movement towards a one-world government. He also strongly believes that if Hillary Clinton of the Democrats had won the election, a chain of events would have ensued which would intensify the persecution of Christians and Jews. In a video interview released on his official page months before the US General Elections, he said the world would have been taken over by Anti-Christ if Hillary Clinton had won. According to him, \\"The movement was towards a one- world government and consequently the one-world religion as well as the full revelation of the anti-Christ. If the moves by the Democratic had succeeded, we would have ended up having a one-world government. That would have intensified the persecution of Christians and the Jews and the eventual manifestation of the Anti-Christ. You will recall that the within the last five years, Christians around the world had been persecuted more than any other season since the first century of the Church. This resulted in the murder of thousands of Christians in the Middle East by the ISIS as well as here in Nigeria where several lives have been wasted by the Boko Haram. All these have been happening because the American government turned the other cheek. However the exit of Britain from the European Union has impeded the move to introduce one-world government\\".  Personal life  He married Franca Onyeje in January 1999. They have three children and live in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nigeria.

In 2016, she was named Asia's Best Female Chef. For√©s initially worked in catering, before launching the chain Cibo, as well as several individual restaurants. Early life Born on March 23, 1959 to Raul Fores and Maria Lourdes Araneta, Margarita For√©s is a granddaughter of the tycoon J. Amado Araneta who developed the 35-hectare Araneta Center in Cubao, Quezon City. She grew up in Manila until she was a freshman attending Assumption College San Lorenzo, when the family moved to New York City. The culture in her new city would eventually serve as inspiration for her culinary career, with Sunday visits to the same midtown American-Italian restaurant led to her interest in learning about the Italian food that was not so well known outside of the local areas in the country. Once in America, she attended the Marymount School of New York on the Upper East Side of the city. She attended Mount Holyoke College for two years, by which time she had a Filipino boyfriend and asked her mother to return to her home country. Although her mother, she gave permission and For√©s resumed her education until graduation in 1981 at Assumption College. By this time, the relationship was over. With a degree in accountancy, she moved to Hong Kong and worked as a trainee for Axona Holdings. While there, she began to experiment with cooking. When the company downsized during the 1980s as the market shrank while preparations were underway for the British colony to be transferred to China, she moved back to New York. Reunited with her family, her mother got her a job working for fur licensee Valentino's, and eventually moved onto their head office. While she was away, her mother had become heavily involved in the New York party scene, with For√©s later recalling the time she was introduced to people such as Salvador Dali, John F. Kennedy Jr., Franco Rossellini and Margaux Hemingway. She once again began to cook for herself, family and friends, describing it as a Martha Stewart influenced approach. Following the death of her grandfather in November 1985, the family returned to Manila. She began to crave a change, describing it as \\"They say when there are major changes in a family, when something happens to key members, it‚Äôs an opportunity for other members of the family to also make changes in their lives, it was a pivotal point. I was beginning to see that I was becoming more passionate about food than the fashion. It didn‚Äôt really get me in the gut as much as the food.\\" Culinary career In 1986, For√©s went to Italy for four months to undertake an intensive training both in Italian cuisine as well as the language. She has had no formal training in culinary skills. For√©s studied under three chefs in Italy, Masha Innoscenti in Florence, Jo Bettoja in Rome, and Ada Parasiliti in Milan. Having made friends in Italy, she learned additional techniques from watching people in their homes create food such as pesto, saying \\"It was really like an immersion, learning it from an Italian family and an Italian mother. How much better can your education in Italian food and culture get?\\" The trip to Italy also helped her to overcome bulimia, something which she had been affected by since returning to New York. She initially began as a caterer, having created the company Cibo Di M, cooking directly in people's homes with two sous chefs to help her. She ran a food festival in the restaurant at the Hyatt Regency Manila which was a success, although she was stigmatised because of her privileged upbringing. In 1997, she opened her first Cibo restaurant - which she specifically targeted at serving traditional Italian food but with good value for money. Her mother provided the seed money for the venture. She saw her main competitors at the time as being the American cuisine based chains TGI Friday's and Hard Rock Cafe, but criticised that these were not Filipino owned operations. In addition to the Cibo chain, she controls the restaurants Lusso, Grace Park and Alta. They each serve Italian cuisine but in different ways, with Lusso refining Italian comfort food, while Grace Park includes some of her twists on childhood favourites, including a savoury Eton mess with pancetta, bacon and truffle oil served alongside the meringue components. This restaurant was opened after she recovered from cancer, and so it inspired her to work predominantly with organic ingredients, which was not common in the Philippines at the time. The menu also includes some elements of Filipino cuisine. Alta is her most recent restaurant, located within the Ascott Hotel at Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. In 2016, she appeared on an episode of Inspired With Anna Olson, with Canadian chef Anna Olson. She separately appeared on CNNs television series Culinary Journeys. =Awards= She was named Asia's Best Female Chef as part of the 2016 Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list, part of The World's 50 Best Restaurants. For√©s admitted surprise at winning the award, comparing it to Miss Universe, and credited the victory to her work in promoting Filipino products both within the Philippines and abroad. She has recently been promoting Job's tears, a gluten-free grain grown in areas of the Philippines where rice does not grow successfully. Personal For√©s has overcome cancer twice, including thyroid cancer around 2006. She has a son, Jorge Amado.

Context Following unification in 1871 Germany underwent several decades of rapid economic modernisation and growth, which was coupled with government encouragement for expressions of national pride. This was reflected in a building boom in Karlsruhe and across the country. New churches, commercial properties and homes for rich entrepreneurs were enhanced with fashionable coloured glass embellishments, elaborate ironwork grills and ceramic tiles, wall-mounted fountains in entrance halls and, naturally, with sculptures. Municipal authorities and other public bodies also competed to commission and erect imposing sculptures in public squares, outside public buildings and in other suitable locations. This provided encouragement and opportunity for artists such as Dietsche in Karlsruhe as elsewhere. Life Fridolin Dietsche was born at Sch√∂nau im Schwarzwald, a small town along the Wiese valley in the hills to the north-east of Basel. His father was a cabinet maker. His artistic journey began with a three-year training at the wood carving school in Furtwangen. After that, between 1880 and 1884 he studied at the \\"Arts and Crafts Academy\\" (\\"Kunstgewerbeschule\\") in Karlsruhe. The next year was spent at the Arts and Crafts Academy in Berlin, before a two-year period of study under Fritz Schaper at the Prussian Academy of Arts. He then studied more briefly under Wilhelm von R√ºmann at the Fine Arts Academy in Munich, before returning to Karksruhe. Back at the \\"Arts and Crafts Academy\\" in Karlsruhe he was a \\"masters student\\" (\\"Meistersch√ºler\\") of , while also working as a researcher and undertaking teaching assignments between 1888 and 1898. He also took the opportunity to undertake extended study trips to Paris and to Italy. In 1898 he succeeded as Professor of Sculpture at the Karlsruhe academy. In a competition for the commission of figures for the new facade of the Freiburg city hall, he was able to win against a rival tender from the city's own .Ute Scherb: Wir bekommen die Denkm√§ler, die wir verdienen. Freiburger Monumente im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. (= Ver√∂ffentlichungen aus dem Archiv der Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau. Vol. 36). Freiburg 2005, , p. 88f. With his pupil, Wilhelm Merten (1879‚Äì1952), he created for the city-hall facade a figure of Egino, the first Count of Freiburg. Another of the niches accommodated Dietsche's statue of Conrad I, Duke of Z√§hringen, which before finding its more permanent position was exhibited at the Paris World Fair in 1900. It was melted down during the Second World War.Karl Schmid, Hans Schadek: Die Z√§hringer. Vol. 2: Anstoss und Wirkung. Thorbecke, Sigmaringen 1986, , p. 368 f.) The other two spaces displayed figures of Leopold III, Margrave of Austria and of Charles Frederick, the first Grand Duke of Baden.Ute Scherb: Wir bekommen die Denkm√§ler die wir verdienen. Freiburger Monumente im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. from: Ulrich P. Ecker, Christiane Pfanz- Sponagel, Hans-Peter Widmann (compiler-editor): Ver√∂ffentlichungen aus dem Archiv der Stadt Freiburg im Breisgau., 2005, p. 89. Four statues in Freiburg's Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe were also taken down in 1942 and transported to Hamburg in order to be melted down. Two of these four (Emperor Maximilian I and Rudolf I) were also the work of Fridolin Dietsche, again with input, in the case of King Rudolf's statue, from Wilhelm Merten. The other two, produced between 1899 and 1900, were the work of . When war ended in May 1945 all four of these bronze figures were still intact, but they were in Hamburg and war had exhausted the city's finances. In 1950 the Freiburg city council, mindful of the high cost of transporting the figures back south, renounced any rights to have them returned. Between 1900 and 1901 Dietsche took part in another competition, this time for the creation of Karlsruhe's Bismarck Memorial. There was no overall winner of the competition as originally configured, but in a second version Dietsche's submission was determined to be the best available (\\"relativ besten\\"). Subsequently, however, the memorial committee decided to go ahead with one of the (three) proposals submitted by Karl Friedrich Moest. Despite being evidently underwhelmed by all the submissions, the committee let it be known that they favoured Moest because he was more than twenty years older than Dietsche who would, they anticipated, have plenty more opportunities to create public sculptures. Ironically, Moest would live to be 85, dying only in 1923, while Dietsche died in 1908 aged 45.Diverse.

Shortly before he died Dietscke was given a commission by The Grand Duke Frederick to draft a proposal for a memorial to Karlsruhe's founder, Margrave Charles III William. The intention was to replace the Karlsruhe Pyramid in the Market Square. After there was a public outcry against the idea of removing the pyramid, Dietsche submitted a proposal that combined the pyramid with the required memorial. He prepared a model which added a separated fountain and equestrian statue which won widespread support when it was exhibited, but before the project could be further progressed he died at Hamburg while travelling to a coastal cure resort for a medical investigation.

It was first described in 1964 and was studied in the treatment of breast cancer, but was not introduced for clinical use. The drug re-emerged in 2004 when it started being sold on the Internet as a \\"dietary supplement\\". MOHN joined other AAS as a controlled substance in the United States on 20 January 2005. MOHN is non-aromatizable due to the presence of a hydroxy group at the C4 position, and for this reason, poses no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia at any dosage, unlike many other AAS. 5Œ±-Reduction is also inhibited by the C4 hydroxy group of MOHN and, because of this, MOHN may have a relatively higher ratio of androgenic to anabolic activity than other nandrolone derivatives (as 5Œ±-reduction, opposite to the case of most other AAS, decreases AAS potency for most nandrolone derivatives). Early assays found that MOHN had approximately 13 times the anabolic activity and 3 times the androgenic activity of methyltestosterone. MOHN is the 4-hydroxylated derivative of normethandrone (17Œ±-methyl-19-nortestosterone), the 17Œ±-methylated derivative of oxabolone (4-hydroxy-19-nortestosterone), the 4-hydroxylated and 17Œ±-methylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), and the 19-demethylated analogue of oxymesterone (4-hydroxy-17Œ±-methyltestosterone).

He was his master's principal copyist, and most of the manuscripts of Voltaire's work form the last twenty years of his life are in Wagni√®re's hand. In the 1770s, Voltaire probably dictated more than 90% of his letters to Wagni√®re. Wagni√®re was not with Voltaire at the end of his life. Having spent several months in Paris and realising that he probably could not survive a return journey to Ferney, Voltaire gave him power of attorney and sent him back to Ferney to deal with matters on the estate. After three weeks Madame Denis decided to recall him to be with Voltaire but Voltaire was dead by the time Wagni√®re returned.Ian Davidson, Voltaire ‚Äì A Life, Profile Books 2010 p.458 The last letter Voltaire wrote was to Wagni√®re: 'I am dying my dear Wagni√®re, it seems quite difficult that I can avoid it. I am really punished for your departure, for having left Ferney, and for having taken a house in Paris. I embrace you tenderly, my dear friend, and with sadness.' Ian Davidson, Voltaire ‚Äì A Life, Profile Books 2010 p.460 Voltaire's Library After Voltaire's death on 30 May 1778, Catherine the Great of Russia commissioned Wagni√®re to install his library at the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg, which she had acquired from his estate. Wagni√®re did so, carefully locating the books in the same order as they had followed in Ferney. He also compiled two inventories, one of the manuscripts preserved in the library, and the other of Voltaire's marginal notes in various works. His Master's Legacy After his return from Russia, Wagni√®re dedicated himself to the memory and the legacy of his master, editing four biographical accounts between 1780 and 1787: 'la Relation du dernier voyage de Voltaire' ('An Account of Voltaire's Last Journey') (1780-1781), les Additions au Commentaire Historique' ('Additions to the Historic Commentary')(1781), 'l‚ÄôExamen des M√©moires secrets dits de Bachaumont' ('An Examination of the Secret Memoirs said to be by Bachaumont') (1783), and 'l‚ÄôExamen des M√©moires pour servir √† l‚Äôhistoire de M. de Voltaire' ('An Examination of Memoirs Contributing to the History of M. de Voltaire' (1787).Raymonde Morizot, L'autobiographie chez Voltaire, Editions Publibook 2006 These texts circulated in manuscript form at the end of the eighteenth century, and were edited in 1826 by two of Voltaire's greatest editors, Beuchot and Decroix. They were considered to be 'one of the most reliable sources for the biography of Voltaire',Ren√© Pomeau √©d., Voltaire en son temps, 2 vol., Paris, Fayard, et Oxford, Voltaire Foundation, 1995, vol 1, p.781 and Wagni√®re was recognised by the scholarly community as 'the only living dictionary of all that took place in the final twenty-four years of the most celebrated man of our times'.Fran√ßois Tronchin to Friedrich Melchior Grimm, 29 septembre 1778, cited in C. Paillard, 'Jean- Louis Wagni√®re, secr√©taire de Voltaire', Oxford, Voltaire Foundation, 2008, p.112 However no critical edition of these texts was produced - Beuchot and Decroix both rewrote them rather than editing them.Christophe Paillard, ¬´Du nouveau sur la mort, digne ou indigne, de Voltaire.

However his attempts were fruitless and nothing he sent to Beaumarchais was included in the Kehl Edition of Voltaire's works. On 9 December 1792, Wagni√®re was elected mayor of Ferney- Voltaire.

The organization was reportedly involved in 1963 events and 1965 assassination of Hassan Ali Mansur. However, it is alleged that opening fire on Police before arrest of leading members was its \\"sole standoff\\". After a visit to Iraq, leader Mousavi-Bojnourdi brought two firearms for the planned bank robbery and kidnapping. A rank-and-file member was arrested accidentally and led security forces to a 140-men list of the members. A cache of arms belonging to the party was also discovered in the hills of north Tehran. 55 members of the group were arrested in 1965 and received long-term confinements in 1966 by military tribunal. Four members were executed and death sentence of the leader Mousavi-Bojnourdi reduced to life in prison. A number of Revolutionary Guards commanders including Javad Mansouri, Abbas Zamani and Abbas Duzduzani were members of the group.

It was founded in 2013 by artist Alan J Lawson and Jacob Burda.  The Symposium  The focal point of activities is an annual four day symposium. The symposium 'draws together participants from academia, the arts and business' and they have been held on the themes of 'home', 'representation', 'the self-portrait', 'ephemera' and 'landscape'. Fellows, \\"can attend the symposium by competing in one of the different prize categories: drama, writing and visual arts.\\" Previous guests have included playwrights Jessica Swale, Polly Stenham, actor Charity Wakefield, philosophers Simon May and Sir Roger Scruton, the novelist Ian McEwan, the poets, Ruth Padel, Gillian Clarke and John Burnside, film maker Luc Jacquet and art historians, including Andrew Graham-Dixon. Symposiums have been held in Switzerland, Scotland, and Italy. In 2015 The Alpine Fellowship endowed the ‚ÄòAlpine Fellows‚Äô programme at NYU ensuring financial support for students pursuing interdisciplinary research at the Graduate Level at NYU. 264x264px  Past events  In 2014, the Fellowship discussed the theme of 'representation' with contributions from the realms of academia, music and the visual arts. Philosophers emphasized the difficulties and dangers inherent in the subjectivist approach that regards the world as the 'mere' representation of the subject. The annual symposium was held at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini, on the island of San Giorgio, Venice, in the years 2015 through 2018. The 2015, symposium convened over the theme 'authorittrato - self-expression in the age of instant communication'. Participants tried to trace the historical developments that occurred since Albrecht D√ºrer's self-portrait in 1500 to today's 'selfie-culture'. In 2016, the Fellowship convened on the topic of ‚ÄòEphemera‚Äô and the nature of time. Philosophers Luciano Floridi and Mark Wrathall spoke to underline the way our self-understanding is inextricably bound up with our understanding of time. In 2017, the Fellowship discussed the theme of 'Landscape'. Amongst other things, virtual reality pioneer Nonny de la Pena gave a talk on 'virtual landscapes' that stirred much debate. In 2018, the theme was 'Childhood'. In 2019, the theme was 'Identity' and the symposium was hosted at Fj√§lln√§s, Sweden.  Prizes  The Alpine Fellowship offers a number of prizes aimed at supporting emerging artists, writers and playwrights from around the world.

It was first encountered in 2005 when it was introduced as a \\"dietary supplement\\" and putative prohormone under the name Halodrol-50 by industry veteran, Bruce Kneller while working with the dietary supplement company, Gaspari Nutrition. The drug was the subject of a scathing and highly critical article by The Washington Post in November 2006. CDMA was voluntarily discontinued by Gaspari Nutrition in mid-2006, likely fearing government sanctions if it continued to sell the product. During the brief period of time that CDMA was sold online, it was an extremely well- selling product; its total sales are estimated to have been greater than twenty five million dollars, and by some estimates, CDMA may have been the best-selling hormonal product ever sold \\"over-the-counter\\" (i.e., without a prescription) in the United States.CDMA continued to be sold online until the 2014 prohormone ban as generic versions known as clones. Although CDMA was sold as a \\"prohormone\\" or \\"prosteroid\\" of chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (CDMT), it is likely that the conversion is far from complete and that much of the activity of the drug may be attributable to its unchanged form. Due to the presence of a chloro group at the C4 position, CDMA cannot be aromatized, and for this reason, poses no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia at any dosage. It is not extensively metabolized by 5Œ±-reductase and exhibits relatively greater anabolic than androgenic activity, but is still capable of producing androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, and increased growth of facial and body hair, as well as virilization in women. As with other 17Œ±-alkylated AAS, CDMA poses a risk of hepatotoxicity. CDMA is closely related to chloromethylandrostenediol (CMA; Promagnon), which was also developed by industry veteran Bruce Kneller and was also briefly sold on the Internet in 2005 and 2006, though by a different company (Peak Performance Laboratories). Both compounds were derived from CDMT (brand name Oral Turinabol), a popular AAS that was introduced in the 1960s.

He was heavily influenced by the Dutch Masters and many of his works are set in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Biography  His father was the history painter , who was his first teacher. Later, he followed his father's example and enrolled at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, where he studied with , Andreas M√ºller and Julius Roeting, whose daughter, Anna, he would later marry. Afterwards, he took private lessons from Eduard von Gebhardt.

This period was followed by an extended trip to Belgium and the Netherlands, where he focused on studies from nature. In 1881 at Rotterdam, he presented a Panorama depicting the victory of Maurice, Prince of Orange over the Spaniards at the Battle of Nieuwpoort.

Members of this group vary widely in size (2‚Äì33 mm long) and shape, but were thought to be derived from an ancient ball-rolling lineage. The outer edges of the front tibiae have less than four teeth. The grouping based on these characteristics has, however, been found to have little phylogenetic validity, and the placement of several genera in the tribe is likely to change. Taxonomy There has been some controversy regarding the valid name for this tribe. Deltochilini is the senior name, and has precedence under the ICZN, but in 2006, Smith suggested that the name Canthonini, though junior, might be preserved under Code Article 35.5, which can be used to preserve junior names if they are higher in taxonomic rank than the senior names of constituent taxa.Smith, A.B.T. (2006) A Review of the Family-group Names for the Superfamily Scarabaeoidea (Coleoptera) with Corrections to Nomenclature and a Current Classification. The Coleopterists Bulletin, 60:144-204. However, this Article does not apply when two names are competing for the same taxonomic rank (as in this case, both being used at the rank of tribe), so this conclusion has been reversed by subsequent classifications, restoring Deltochilini as the valid name. The tribe comprises about 800 species in 120 genera: They constitute a high proportion of the dung beetle diversity in many parts of the world; more than 35% of the genera in the Americas, Australia, Madagascar and many islands.

The Turkmen Shiite family had been at the hospital as Kamila had been ill. Samar Hassan remembers they left their home at sunset when it was raining and this would suggest the family set out for the hospital after Hussein Hassan returned home after work at the Electricity office, where he was a clerk. It can be reasonably presumed that he made the short journey to work each day in this sedan and, after almost two years, must have had some encounters with the occupying military force (predominantly American but Australians were also there initially) and he have been aware of its belligerent routines. The hospital visit must have been reasonably brief as the sun had set but Mansour Boulevard was still wet in the dusk light as they entered it on their return journey. It was approximately 5:50pm and, as twilight and the 6pm curfew arrived, the car had entered the Al-Sarai neighborhood where at least two combat squads were conducting a 'presence patrol' (probably as part of Operation Virgo). This 'dismounted' patrol was likely maintaining a secure route for the Coalition main combat outpost (COP) (located in the Ottoman-era Tal Afar Citadel) and the Coalition military base 'FOB Sykes' (10 miles south at the Tall Afar Air Base) with an uncodified mission to prevent 'terrain denial.' (ie. try to prevent insurgents planting bombs). The combat squad from A/1-5 comprised approximately 7 soldiers (Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment (1/5IN) 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division (1/25ID) (out of Fort Lewis, WA)), an interpreter (who didn't speak Turkmen, the language of 80 per cent of the population) and 'embedded' Getty Images photojournalist Chris Hondros. They were apparently working with a second squad (but separated from them) and were walking tactically along the road, initially at intervals of approximately 20 meters, and no doubt difficult to see in their camouflaged uniforms (DCU) against the closed, dull shopfronts and fading light. Hussein Hassan unwittingly drove towards the soldiers, according to his son, Rakan, in the rear seat,[at least, as reported by Newsweek) but Hassan was not approaching a checkpoint as was erroneously reported in numerous media, including the BBC, The Guardian and The New York Times as per an untruthful statement from Coalition Central Command that was echoed in Associated Press and Agence France Presse media releases issued the following morning. Chris Hondros later said he heard the car's engine whining as if it was speeding up and this is probably true as vehicles that turn off an intersection and that travel down slight inclines (as Mansour Blvd is, at this point) may be expected to be increase speed, up to the speed limit. It is likely that the driver, Hussein Hassan, was also conscious of the impending curfew at 6pm - this was interpreted by some locals (in a culture that did not value clock-watching) and sometimes enforced by the Coalition military - as nightfall. Somewhat ironically, it had been the combat squads that had been late leaving their base (possibly due to a passing shower). Interdiction As Hussein Hassan took a right-hand curve down Mansour Boulevard towards the dispersed squad from about '100 yards,' someone called out: \\"We have a car coming!\\" An officer then used his headset to tell the soldiers to \\"Stop that car!\\" There was an immediate short burst of gunfire which, according to an internal United States military report, was aimed at the front tire but photographs suggest approximately seven bullets were fired from in front of the vehicle at the left side of the windscreen. One of these shots likely killed Kamila Hassan. The soldiers had not, as per the Rules of Engagement [ROE], identified a legitimate military target and these same rules say \\"Do not fire warning shots.\\" One soldier has written \\"When the vehicle failed to stop, several soldiers then fired directly at it with automatic and semi-automatic fire (hitting the windscreen, left and center), which killed the driver and the front passenger\\", however, this is not the whole truth in that, given that the United States military told Newsweek (March, 2005) that there were six shooters, and given that side- and rear-windows were shattered, it appears multiple projectiles were then fired at the vehicle from the left side and rear as the car traveled past the individual soldiers. 'Embedded' eyewitness Indeed, according to Newsweek, six soldiers had quickly shot at the Hassan's car with their Colt submachine guns M249 light machine gun (and possibly also Benelli 12-gauge military shotguns) and 'embedded' eyewitness photojournalist Chris Hondros said- There was a \\"cacophony of fire, shots rattling off in a chaotic overlapping din. The car entered the intersection on its momentum and still shots were penetrating it and slicing it. Finally the shooting stopped, the car drifted listlessly, clearly no longer being steered, and came to a rest on a curb.\\" The vehicle had come to a stop (unusually) at a near right-angle against the curb. Within 24 hours, a '15-6' military inquiry (by the soldiers' own superiors) found that the soldiers' actions were effectively \\"reasonable in intensity, duration, [and] magnitude.\\" Victims Both parents, Hussein and Kamila Hassan, were killed instantly by multiple shots to the head and upper body. An apparent exit wound on Hussein's face suggest that at least some of the fatal shots came from behind as the car receded from the shooter(s). One of the five children, Rakan, 11, was rendered a paraplegic (and incontinent) by a serious wound to his lower back that sliced his sacrum and damaged his bowel and bladder. He was treated at the roadside for approximately 15 minutes to prevent blood loss and transported to and treated at Tal Afar hospital (and, a week later, moved to Mosul hospital). Jilan was treated for shrapnel injuries to her face; Samar, 5, was treated for a bullet wound to her right hand and cuts to her face; and Rana was apparently physically uninjured but traumatized to the extent that she developed incontinence. It is not clear if infant Mohammed was actually in the car at the time of the shooting. They were all taken to Tal Afar hospital before 7pm, where the bodies of their parents were deposited at the hospital's morgue. Rakan stayed at the hospital while the other four children were returned to their home by an ambulance driver as the soldiers had already returned to their base, (apparently, after a brief meeting en-route), in time for the first report to be submitted before 9pm and the second before 9:15pm. In 2006, Rakan Hassan was flown to Boston for treatment for his paralysis, damaged nerves in his right foot and the six pieces of shrapnel still lodged near his spine. This was due, primarily, to the efforts of American aid worker, Marla Ruzicka, Senator Ted Kennedy and philanthropist Raymond Tye. In January, 2007, Rakan was returned to Iraq (at the time, arguably, the most dangerous country in the world) and is said to have been killed there on June 16, 2008 on a bomb blast on his brother-in-law's home in Mosul (his uncle later speculated he was targeted by insurgents who thought he, the uncle, was an American spy because he had accompanied Rakan to Boston). 'Sympathy' payment The Coalition military, represented by the United States, later indicated an 'elder,' of the orphaned children, Abdul Yusuf, would receive $7,500 as a gesture of sympathy but the New York Times reported that the children all went to live with their oldest sister in Mosul and may not have benefited from the money. A concerned American citizen Malcolm Mead, established a fund-raising website for the orphans and raised more than $10,000 within 14 months although it appears this money may have been spent assisting Rakan receive medical treatment in Boston as, in 2011, the New York Times was reporting the surviving children did not have enough money for clothes. Contrary to what Chris Hondros said in August, 2005, it appears the fund raising money did not \\"set [the children] up for life.\\" Less than a decade later, Samar Hassan said \\"No one helped us after the death of my mother and father. No one had any mercy on us or gave us a penny.\\" Chris Hondros Chris Hondros took powerful pictures of the shooting and aftermath and quickly sent at least two of the photos onto Getty Images New York City headquarters via Milan. Hondros won several awards for the still photos of five-year-old Samar Hassan, including World Press Photo (Spot News) second prize, 2006, and the Robert Capa Gold Medal, 2005, for \\"Best Published photographic reporting from abroad requiring exceptional courage and enterprise...for his reporting on \\"One Night in Tal Afar.\\" This photo appears to have been published most widely in Europe, Canada and Ireland, which is to say, countries not directly involved in the war and his series of photos remain current on the BBC News website. There was a photo slide show along with Hondros' account of the incident published on Newsweek.com., however, this story contains factual inaccuracies, misleading statements, and conspicuous omissions. Newsweek suggested that the incident was emblematic of the \\"horrors of war,\\" which is to say, they removed agency as a determining factor. On January 31, 2005, Lieut. Col. Steve Boylan told Newsweek that \\"In a perfect world, it wouldn't happen. But we're not in a perfect world.\\" Chris Hondros left his embedded position after just six days and only two days after perhaps risking his life on the Sunday afternoon to photograph this same company in a courageous light during an ongoing firefight (but he didn't let the grass grow under his feet as he was in Baghdad later that same day recording Sen. John Kerry's third visit to Iraq). The images Hondros took raise important questions about photojournalism ethics in regard to defenceless, traumatized (orphaned) children and ethical- and legal-consent as well as the regime of journalism 'objectivity' where journalists consider themselves detached bystanders that privileges scientific-determinist behavior above active caring and compassion. While Hondros was an independent witness, his written accounts and quotes to journalists about the incident in four respected publications immediately and years after the event attest to the value of the 'embedded' strategy for the Coalition military in that Hondros occasionally uses language to downplay the incident, suggesting his patriotism (or at least, native US acculturation) overrode his commitment to complete objectivity and the absolute truth (for example, in The Independent, 20 Jan, 2005, he infers it was dark at the time of the shooting when it was not; he states that Rakan had been \\"winged\\" when it must have been immediately clear to him - only meters away on the street and at the hospital- that Rakan had sustained a very serious injury when he couldn't move his legs at all and was bleeding profusely; and in Boston to document Rakan's surgery a year later, captions on his photos still infer there was a checkpoint). These statements are perhaps understandable given he relied on the soldiers for his own safety, security, food, shelter and transport and he probably established quick friendships with some of them. His skill and courage then, and in repeatedly touring Iraq and other war zones, cannot be questioned and without his Tal Afar images, this incident would surely have been lost to history. Hondros was killed in Misrata, Libya in 2011. Visibility Significantly, while dusk was receding to evening and street lights and car headlights were beginning to have an effect, there was clear visibility at the time of the shooting. The rain had cleared and, as the soldiers' weapons had telescopic sights and gunlights, identifying that there was a front seat passenger (and 4-5 in the rear?) should have been quiet straightforward. Inside the car, as it had traveled along the boulevard, Rakan Hassan, aged 11, had been the first to see one or more of the soldiers but, as he alerted his father, there was the burst of gunfire and then the \\"cacophony of [gun]fire\\" which killed his parents and hit him and one of his sisters, Samar. Signalling Some news reports, quoting military officials, suggest the soldiers used \\"visual signals\\" to attract the attention of the driver, Hussein Hassan, although Chris Hondros later said the soldiers immediately raised their weapons when they heard \\"Stop that car!\\" If there were any signals, it is possible that their gestures were 'Western' in that indicating with one arm (while holding a heavy weapon in the other) did not take into account local cultural differences where the waving of one arm may not necessarily be interpreted as a warning to stop (arms crossed above head and legs planted firmly and widely may be a more appropriate signal to warn). The soldiers did not use any other non-lethal methods of warning such as spotlights, lasers, flares, Arabic or Turkmen signs, flags, air horns, traffic cones, portable speed bumps, collapsible spikes strips or even grenade simulators. Insurgent behaviour Coalition belligerent soldiers in Tal Afar, to January 18, 2005, had been regularly exposed to street attacks most often consisting of small-arms fire and rocket- propelled grenades (RPGs). Mortars or shots fired at the 'Combat Outpost' in the Tal Afar Citadel were also reported. To January 18, 2005, the American military SIGACT administration database lists 156 enemy actions of which 103 were \\"direct fire\\". There had also seen 70 'IED' (concealed bombs) attacks in Tal Afar or the wider vicinity since the start of the invasion in March, 2003 although it appears the only Coalition death from IEDs in the Tal Afar wider area was on February 16, 2004 when one United States soldier was killed. However, 11 local civilians or Iraqi police had also been killed by IED's to this time. The most deadly attack was on September 30, 2004 when 4 locals were killed and 16 injured when a bomb exploded outside a Tal Afar mosque. Suicide attacks In a media release the following day, Coalition Central Command intimated that the soldiers may have feared a suicide car bomb attack (SVBIED) although none had been reported in Tal Afar to this date. Mosul, 80 km East, had had seven suicide-vehicle attacks (on six occasions) in the previous 12 months (although since November, 2004, an additional four bombs hidden in stationary, unoccupied vehicles suggested the insurgents' modus operandi had changed in that city, at least). As the Hassan car approached, the weight of two adults and 6 (malnourished) children may have suggested the car contained more than just one driver (that said, there are reports of insurgents strengthening rear suspensions struts to try to conceal a heavy amount of explosives so the appearance of a vehicle was an unreliable determinant in this regard). It was much more likely the vehicle was not a suicide bomber and the fact that the soldiers did not take cover in nearby alley ways or an adjacent open patch of land suggests they instinctively knew this (half of all suicide attacks to Jan., 2005, occurred in Baghdad and some bombers, at least, were rigged so that they had to hold their hand on the trigger to stop it detonating, meaning shooting at them at close range was not a particularly safe strategy). As at January, 2005, Tal Afar had not had a suicide car bombing; the car had a passenger in the front seat; the car was not near an official checkpoint, a (perceived) common target; the vehicle did not match the common profile of a suicide attack vehicle (in Jan, 2005, a utility 'pick up') and the three Stryker vehicles that were stationed ahead were armored, were blocking the right-hand lane ahead, and had presumably been parked there surreptitiously on the covert patrol (indeed, they weighed 19 tonnes and Italian-made landmines could not destroy them). These factors all suggest both the soldiers on foot and the Strykers themselves were unlikely targets on a cool, late afternoon in Winter as the curfew approached. Coalition military strategy The initial, active belligerent countries in the Iraq War were Australia, Denmark, Poland, United Kingdom and the United States of America. This incident appears emblematic of a Coalition and, in particular, an American approach to the insurgency in the area at this time and even Iraq more widely, despite the fact that Tal Afar, was initially considered \\"Pro-American\\" given its very large majority Turkmen population, a millennia of Ottoman history and that it is only some 70 kilometers from the border of one of the United States allies, Turkey. Yet, as David R. McCone, Wilbur J. Scott, and George R. Mastroianni (2008) note in reviewing Coalition forces in Tal Afar in 2005: \\"The 3rd ACR [not the unit involved in the aforementioned incident but of the culture and using the same tactics and resources] was neither configured nor trained to fight person-on-person, much less confront an ill-defined insurgency. Featuring Bradley fighting vehicles, Abrams tanks, Apache attack helicopters, and armed-to-the-teeth dismounts, it settled into aggressive, armor-based patrolling and searching routines. Though well-intentioned (!), these heavy-handed techniques were better suited for a conventional battlefield than one populated by towns, villages, and, of course, civilians.\\" Staff Sergeant (S-Sgt) Darrell Griffin said in Nov., 2004, \\"We have made our dominance known throughout the city just waiting for someone to pick a fight with us\\" and later, he was of the view that \\"Each man [soldier] had to project balls as big as ten men\\" as part of a consistent \\"show of force.\\" It appears this incident (and hundreds of others like it) did prompt an evaluation of strategy as the United States military released the \\"Escalation of Force Handbook\\" in July 2007. By 2009, however, \\"Escalation of Force\\" incidents (such as this one in Tal Afar) had seen 2,899 civilians killed or injured and 120 insurgents killed by coalition forces while in the same period, 13 coalition soldiers were killed under the same circumstances. Among the more shocking were the killing of 6 members of one family on Sept. 29, 2004 near Saqlawiyah and the killing of 7 members of one family (and 2 injured) at 'Hurricane Point' on June 14, 2005. In its administration SIGACT system, the United States military refers to these as \\"Friendly Actions.\\" Chain of command For this incident, the chain of command appears to have been- Mr. George W. Bush, Commander-in-Chief Mr. Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense Commanding General George W. Casey Jr. Lieut. Gen. David Petraeus, Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq [North] Brig.

It was first encountered in 2005 when it was introduced as a \\"dietary supplement\\" and putative prohormone under the name Promagnon by an online vendor called Peak Performance Laboratories. CMA was voluntarily discontinued by Gaspari Nutrition in late 2006, likely fearing government sanctions if it continued to sell the product. Although CMA was sold as a \\"prohormone\\" or \\"prosteroid\\" of chloromethyltestosterone (CMT; also known more commonly as methylclostebol), it is likely that the conversion is far from complete and that much of the activity of the drug may be attributable to its unchanged form. Due to the presence of a chloro group at the C4 position, CMA cannot be aromatized, and for this reason, poses no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia at any dosage. It is not extensively metabolized by 5Œ±-reductase and exhibits relatively greater anabolic than androgenic activity, but is still capable of producing androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, and increased growth of facial and body hair, as well as virilization in women. As with other 17Œ±-alkylated AAS, CMA may pose a risk of hepatotoxicity. CMA is closely related to chlorodehydromethylandrostenediol (CDMA; Halodrol-50) which was developed by industry veteran Bruce Kneller, and was also briefly sold on the Internet in 2005 and 2006, though by a different company (Giant Sports). Both drugs were derived from chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (CDMT; brand name Oral Turinabol), a popular AAS that was introduced in the 1960s.

While it was short lived, existing from only 1887 to 1892, they designed a number of outstanding projects, and all three members designed many more notable projects in earlier and later partnerships. The firm began as Terry & Oakden, a partnership of architects Percy Oakden and the prolific Leonard Terry from 1874 until Terry's death in 1884.George Henry Male Addison and Henry Hardie Kemp then joined in 1887, creating Oakden, Addison & Kemp. Addison, who had started a Brisbane branch in 1889 left in 1892, leaving Oakden and Kemp practicing until Kemp moved to Sydney in 1895, dissolving the partnership in 1896. In 1900 Oakden took on Cedric Henry Ballantyne to become Oakden & Ballantyne, until Oakden died in 1917. One of the earliest projects was North Park, a large mansion for Alexander McCracken, of McCracken's Brewery, completed in 1888, which was amongst Melbourne's first examples of the Queen Anne style. The firm was then took on the design of Australia's first skyscraper (together with John Beswicke), the 12 storey Australian Property Investment Co. Building (later known as the APA building) in Elizabeth Street, amongst the tallest in the world in 1889, it remained Australia's tallest until 1912, and Melbourne's tallest until 1929. It was also designed in the new Queen Anne fashion, the tall spikes and spires of the roof adding to its verticality. The next year they designed the more conventional, but still tall, premises for the Young Men's Christian Association headquarters, with its mansard roofs and internal hall. The YMCA never occupied it, due to the financial crash of the 1890s, which also curtailed the work of the firm, and soon lost Addison as a partner in 1892 to establish a practice in Brisbane.

She was completed in 1875 at the Kiangnan Arsenal, the first time an ironclad had been constructed in China. She was built out of spare components, prior to the construction of a purpose built yard for ironclads. Tien-sing was modified part way through construction to allow it to undertake a sea voyage to Hai River, but instead was only ever used on the Yangtze and Huangpu Rivers. She was still in operation in 1902, having survived the Sino-French War and the First Sino-Japanese War. Design Tien-sing was the only ship of its type constructed, which was built out of spare iron and an extra 17 cm Krupp gun at the Kiangnan Arsenal. It had been intended for ironclads to be built there, and Tien-sing was constructed while the ironclad building yard was also under construction. This made her the first home built ironclad in Chinese service, with the vessel known locally as \\"The Terror of the Western World\\". Her design was later compared to that of HMS Staunch of the Royal Navy, but with additional protection for the Krupp gun. Originally named Chin-ou, she was long overall, had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced . The propulsion system consisted of a reciprocating engine with twin shafts. Her engines produced a cruising speed of . She had a total crew complement of 40. The Krupp gun was on a retractable mount which meant it could be moved into the hull of the ironclad. This was the only armament, other than the forward mounted naval ram which was used to offset the weight of the engine. She was covered in iron deck plating thick, tapered to with teak backing thick. On the sides, the iron plating was thick, tapered to with the same thickness of teak backing. This initial design was to enable her to act as a river-based ironclad, primarily near the mouth of the Huangpu River, and occasionally on the Yangtze. However, Li Hongzhang felt that she should instead be used to defend the Hai River, which would require her to undertake a sea voyage to get there. Changes were then made to the design to improve her buoyancy. Career She was completed in 1875, and had been due to be launched in September of that year. After becoming stuck on the slipway, she was launched at a later date. She was never sent to the Hai River, instead being used as she was originally intended. She was still in operation as of 1888, following the Sino-French War. By 1902, she formed part of the south squadron based out of Fuzhou and Canton, having survived the First Sino-Japanese War, during which time the ships of the northern fleet in the Hai River had been either destroyed or captured.

This was the first Japanese investment in the United States Of America since World War II, and the mill operated from 1959 until 1993.Gary Paxton Industrial Park The majority of production was used to create rayon fabric, and to supply Japan with logs to rebuild homes and infrastructure after World War II. In the later years of the mill, as the demand for rayon and logs for rebuilding decreased, the primary focus of the mill became the manufacture of paper.Mackovjak, James R.Durham, NC: Forest History Society, 2010. Print Tongass Timber: A History of Logging & Timber Utilization in Southeast Alaska Origin In September 1907, the Tongass National Forest was established, and by 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt and the U.S. Forest Service founder Gifford Pinchot have expanded it to 15.4 million acres. The Tongass National Forest became the largest national forest in the United States Of America, and was viewed by many as an opportunity to convert old growth stands into sustainable young growth forests, with an emphasis on pulp production. In 1911, the United States Forest Service began to take an aggressive approach towards timber harvesting in Alaska, and started offering long-term 25-year contracts to potential investors, on the condition that a pulp mill along with a sawmill were constructed. Numerous contracts were advertised, but due to high operation costs, shipping, and rough terrain, many contracts received no bids. This caused lumber firms to rethink their methods for establishing a sustainable timber industry in Alaska.USDA In 1947, with the help of B. Frank Heintzelman, the Tongass Timber Act was established. It entailed up to five pulp timber sales in the Tongass National Forest, and increased contract duration from 25 to 50 years. It also authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to sell timber within the boundaries of the Tongass National Forest, on any vacant unappropriated lands that were claimed by either native entities or other people. This obligated The United States Forest Service to provide 13.5 billion board feet of timber to pulp companies, and allowed pulp mills to take control of selecting harvesting. This act also required the United States Forest Service to take up much of the logging and manufacturing costs, and awarding pulp company‚Äôs credits dollar for dollar on logging roads that were constructed.Southeastern Alaska Timber Industry: Historical Overview and Current Status The Tongass Timber Act helped establish The Ketchikan Pulp Company, followed by the Sitka Pulp Mill. The timber to support these mills increased harvest in the Tongass National Forest from 70 million board feet in 1954 to 405 million board feet in 1965. Operation Over 450 local residents of Sitka were employed at the mill during its peak of manufacturing. The long-term contract that the Alaska Pulp Corporation agreed to committed 5.25 billion board feet. The primary sale area included Baranof Island and portions of the Chichagof Island. The process of manufacturing at the Sitka Pulp Mill consisted of utilizing about 70 percent of Western Hemlock and 30 percent Sitka Spruce. The mill was able to debark logs as large as 1.8 meters in diameter and 7.2 meters in length. The warehouse and dock were able to accommodate 17,000 tons of baled pulp. The wood harvested was towed by water to the mill, then ground into chips for processing. The Sitka Pulp mill used a magnesium sulfide process that created a slurry, followed by a chlorination bleaching process. Guide for Planning Pulp and Paper Enterprises Decline Economic decline of the timber industry and increased environmental concerns regarding pulp production began to influence manufacturing at The Sitka Pulp Mill. In 1970, the Clean Air Act, followed by Clean Water Act in 1972 raised environmental standards. In 1990, Congress passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act. The Tongass Timber Reform Act protected a million acres of land, with high value for wildlife, fish, and local community uses- from logging and road building. The Tongass Timber Reform Act also contained a provision that required harvesting of timber stands in proportion to their occurrence in the forest, rather than targeting the high- volume stands. The decline in wood prices and a decreased demand for rayon began to affect the economic viability of the Sitka pulp mill. Management priorities in the Tongass also began to change - the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act established 5.4 million acres of wilderness areas in the Tongass National Forest.Alaska Forest Association This resulted in closure of The Sitka Pulp Mill. The Alaska Pulp Corporation blamed this closure on provisions included in the Tongass Timber Reform Act, sued the government for damages. The United States Forest Service terminated the timber contract, finding the Alaska Pulp Corporation in breach of contract for not upholding its obligation of mill operation. The Japanese-based company was in debt, and a judge ruled that the closure was due to economic factors, and not the Tongass Timber Reform Act. Environmental Impacts  Chemicals used during the production at the Sitka Pulp Mill consisted of sulfur magnesium oxide, sodium hydroxide, and chlorine gas. Wood ash, wastewater water treatment sludge, and petroleum byproducts were introduced into Sitka‚Äôs landfills and water systems during the Sitka Pulp Mill‚Äôs 34-year history. As a result, many of these harmful chemicals became present into the surrounding ecosystem, which may have affected human, animal, and plant populations. In 1999, the Department Of Environmental Conservation took action to combat these environmental impacts - it has attempted to restore Sawmill Cove by disposing leftover hazardous waste at permitted facilities, as well as through bioremediation of contaminated soils, land use restrictions, and allowing natural ecological recovery. Today The Alaska Pulp Company decided to demolish the mill site and donate the land to the city of Sitka. In 1999, the city of Sitka took control of the land, and removed much of the industrial debris, paving the main roads within the park. The former mill site is now known as Gary Paxton Industrial Park. Three of the large clarifying tanks are now home to the Sitka Bear Fortress tourist attraction.

He was the first Native Hawaiian to be ordained a Protestant minister in 1849. He worked as a missionary in the Marquesas Islands. President Abraham Lincoln presented him with a gold pocket watch after he rescued an American sailor from cannibals. Life At an early age, he was educated in the Christian faith by American missionary Reverend John S. Emerson, stationed in Waialua. He attended the Sunday school of Reverend Benjamin Wyman Parker. He also attended the Lahainaluna Seminary at the expense of Captain James Hunnewell, whose name he adopted as his own. On December 21, 1849, Kekela was ordained as a Protestant minister, the first Native Hawaiian to be ordained. He initially worked as a pastor preaching at a small church in Kahuku, on the island of Oahu, and in 1852, he accompanied a reconnaissance mission to Micronesia to scout out new mission grounds. In 1853, Kekela and his wife Naomi were asked to join the new Protestant mission in the Marquesas Islands. From 1853 until his retirement in 1899, Kekela lived and worked in the Marquesas Islands. He would head the mission along with Reverend Samuel Kauwealoha and Reverend Zachariah Hapuku (who arrived in 1861). Other missionary couples followed as well.

Biography =Origins and appointment to Transylvania= An ethnic Serb, he became a monk at an early age at Savina Monastery in the Bay of Kotor region, and was later made hierodeacon. In 1725, he was sent to study in Kiev, first attending gymnasium and then the Kiev Theological Academy, returning home in 1737. In 1739, he was named professor of theology and philosophy at the seminary in Novi Sad. In 1747, by then a hieromonk, he was transferred to the Eparchy of Buda. When the episcopal seat fell vacant, he was elected bishop, an act confirmed by the Imperial Court in Vienna. In July 1749, the Metropolitan of Karlovci, Pavle Nenadoviƒá, consecrated him bishop. However, his enthronement only took place in February 1751, as Nenadoviƒá was displeased that Novakoviƒá had the support of the imperial authorities.PƒÉcurariu, p. 14 In that year he consecrated the large new Serbian Orthodox church in Buda that was being built since 1742. In late 1758 and into the following year, Orthodox unrest rose in Transylvania, caused by harsh measures taken by the head of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church, Petru Pavel Aron, as well as the local authorities. A series of ministerial conferences took place in Vienna and decided to name an Orthodox bishop, with the stipulation that he was forbidden to oppose the spread of Greek- Catholicism. The alternative of placing the community under Karlovci was dismissed for its potential to create a unified Orthodox bloc, while the suggestion they adhere to the Russian Orthodox Church was viewed as even more dangerous.SƒÉsƒÉujan, p. 248 Thus, in October 1758, State Chancellor Wenzel Anton Kaunitz proposed Novakoviƒá, whom he viewed as wise but not zealous, unlikely to damage Catholicism and with the potential to bring his entire flock to the state church. In spite of internal dissent which viewed the deteriorating situation as the work of Karlovci and proposed it be dealt with by expelling and arresting emissaries of the Serbian metropolitan, Empress Maria Theresa approved the plan.SƒÉsƒÉujan, p. 249 The following July, she issued a decree of toleration for the province's Orthodox population.SƒÉsƒÉujan, p. 239 Dionisije initially declined, due to his inability to speak Romanian, but later promised to learn the language in a few months. In March 1761, the Austrian government named Novakoviƒá administrator of the Orthodox church in Transylvania over the objections of Nenadoviƒá. After receiving instructions from Vienna, he set out for the provincial capital Sibiu, arriving during Holy Week, some three weeks after the new military governor, General Adolf Nikolaus von Buccow.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 14-15 =Activity as bishop= Over the next few months, Dionisije accompanied the general on a tour of the province, in order to assess the situation of the Orthodox church. For example, at Alba Iulia, he was forced to accept the cession of two parishes to the Greek-Catholic Church. One account holds that Petru Pavel Aron, head of the latter institution, officiated a liturgy in an empty, formerly Orthodox church, while Novakoviƒá did the same in the yard, drawing a large crowd.PƒÉcurariu, p. 15 In July 1761, Maria Theresa signed a decree appointing Dionisije to his post in Transylvania; at the same time, he kept his office in Buda. In September, von Buccow installed him in St. Nicholas Church in »òcheii Bra»ôovului, reading the decree in Latin, following which the bishop delivered a speech in the same language. Beforehand, the priests and laymen of »òchei, known for their attachment to Orthodoxy, obliged him to swear allegiance to the faith. The following year, the empress issued a new decree of toleration, this time accompanied by eleven conditions meant to facilitate conversion to Greek Catholicism. Given the cool reception he met in Bra»ôov, Dionisije chose Sibiu as his residence, initially renting a house for two years. During one of his absences, the building was taken over by the head of the local post office, forcing the bishop to move to a three-room peasant house in RƒÉ»ôinari that still stands.PƒÉcurariu, pp. 15-16 In 1764, upon the insistence of his archpriests, he asked the provincial government for permission to build a permanent residence, but the request was denied. It is not known where in Sibiu he held services: either in an improvised chapel, or in the neighboring village churches.PƒÉcurariu, p. 16 In spite of the obstacles placed in his path, Novakoviƒá worked to organize the revived diocese. In 1766, he held a census, finding that there were 635,454 Orthodox under his jurisdiction. The following year, he counted 1224 priests in 44 archpriests' districts. He had ordained 198 of these, while the remainder were ordained either in Wallachia and Moldavia or by Serbian bishops in Arad and Timi»ôoara. His findings constitute the oldest detailed listing of Orthodox priests in Transylvania. Dionisije made several pastoral visits and learned the Romanian language with the help of his secretary and fellow Kiev pupil Dimitrie Eustatievici. He even wrote several short dogmatic and polemical works in the language, but these have been lost.PƒÉcurariu, p. 17 =Final years= The new bishop, received coldly due to his foreign origins and particularly because he had been named from Vienna; faced with serious restrictions that impeded his work; and longing for his Serbian followers in Buda, submitted his resignation in December 1762. This was rejected, but over the following years, he continued to submit petitions requesting his transfer back to Buda. He made suggestions as to his successor, recommending that he be enthroned in his presence so as to avoid incident. Dionisije's advice was ignored, and his resignation was only accepted in February 1767, to take effect in October. He left Transylvania in autumn, settling in Szentendre, which had a large Serbian community. He died two months later, and was buried in the town. Novakoviƒá left behind a certain amount of property, but as he died without a will, this was taken over by the state. Upon the orders of Maria Theresa, the majority went to the Roman Catholic orphanage in Sibiu, while part of it ended up with the Greek-Catholic theological seminary in Blaj.

MobileIron was an early pioneer in mobile security and management for smartphones and tablet computers, such as iPhone, iPad, Android, and earlier mobile devices such as Symbian and Windows Phone. During the five year period from 2009 to 2013, MobileIron was named the fastest growing technology company and ranked #1 on the Deloitte Fast 500 Index. It became publicly traded in 2014 on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol MOBL. After its share price fell from $9 at the time of the IPO to below $4 in early 2016, the company's founding CEO Bob Tinker was replaced by Barry Mainz as CEO, but remained on the company's board of directors. Simon Biddiscombe was appointed CEO in October 2017.

In a 2016 review of MDM solutions, Markus Pierer described MobileIron as the market leader, highlighting its complete support of mobile operating systems, layered security model and fast development and release cycle, but noted its \\"suboptimal\\" support that depended on partners or resellers. Also in 2016, CIO magazine, citing Gartner's study, noted that MobileIron faced increasing competition as \\"one of the last remaining stand-alone EMM vendors\\". It named platform compatibility, third party integration and customer satisfaction as some of MobileIron's strengths, but mentioned an outdated UI and unsatisfactory support among its weaknesses. As of 2016, MobileIron's principal competitors include Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility Suite. Other major EMM competitors are IBM, as well as SAP, Dell/VMWare and BlackBerry who entered the EMM market after their acquisition of previously independent vendors Sybase, AirWatch and Good Technology.

She fought a notable single-ship action against a British privateer General Duff before the British Royal Navy captured her in 1781. The Royal Navy took her into service as the sixth-rate post ship HMS Hussar. Hussar too engaged in a notable action against the French 32-gun frigate Sybille. The Royal Navy sold Hussar in 1783 and a Dutch ship-owner operating from Copenhagen purchased her. She made one voyage to the East Indies for him before he sold her to British owners circa 1786. She leaves Lloyd's Register by 1790. Career =Massachusetts Navy= Captain John Foster Williams received command of the new 20 or 28-gun frigate Protector in the spring of 1780 and took her to sea in June. In accordance with instructions from the Board of War, the new warship cruised in the vicinity of the Newfoundland Banks, on the lookout for British merchantmen. Her vigilance was rewarded early in June. At 0700 on 9 June 1780, Protector spotted a strange ship bearing down on her, flying British colors. At 1100, Protector, also flying English colors, hailed the stranger and found her to be the 32-gun letter-of-marque Admiral Duff, bound for London from St. Kitts. When the enemy's identity had been ascertained, Protector hauled down British colors and ran up the Continental flag‚Äîopening fire almost simultaneously. The action ensued for the next hour and one-half, until Admiral Duff caught fire and exploded, leaving 55 survivors for Protector to rescue soon thereafter. In May 1781, Lloyd's List reported that the rebel frigates and Protector had captured John, Ashburner, master, from Lancaster to St. Kitts, and a ship sailing from Glasgow to Jamaica with 900 barrels of beef and a quantity of dry goods, and had taken them into Martinique.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ1263. In June, Lloyd's List reported that the American privateer Protector, of 28 guns and 179 men, had captured Sally, Townsend, master, which had been sailing from St Kitts to New York.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1280. Notification of these captures took some months to get to Britain. In the meantime, on 5 May 1781, and captured Protector off Sandy Hook. The Royal Navy took her into service as the sixth-rate HMS Hussar. =Royal Navy= The Royal Navy commissioned Hussar under Captain Thomas McNamara Russell (or Thomas Macnamara Russell). On 3 May 1782, Hussar Hussar captured the brig Boston Packet, which was carrying flour and rum. Hussars most famous engagement was the action with the French frigate Sybille. In the action Hussar emerged victorious, having lost only two men killed and five or six wounded. However, the actions of the French captain gave rise to controversy. Hussar arrived at Deptford on 3 June 1783 and was paid off. The Royal Navy sold Hussar on 14 August 1783 for ¬£1540, at Deptford. =Danish ownership= Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck, who was a Dutch trader with a fleet of 64 ships operating from Copenhagen, purchased her.

Biography =Early life= Lemoine DeLeaver Pierce was born on September 2, 1934 at Harlem Hospital in New York, New York. She is the eldest of three children of John Abner DeLeaver of White Stone, Virginia and Flossie Alice White of Kilmarnock, Virginia. In her youth, Pierce spent a lot of time with her maternal grandparents, Alice Roberta and Luther Doggett White on their 48-acre Kilmarnock farm in Lancaster County, Virginia. Her grandparents, denied a formal education, were dedicated to their children having the opportunity. At a time when the Virginia public school system limited African-American children to a sixth grade education, the White‚Äôs sent their 6 children out of state to attend Dunbar High School (also known as the M Street School) in Washington, D.C., one of the few black high schools in the country. Pierce, primarily, grew up in Harlem. The DeLeaver family was among the first to live in the Harlem River Houses in upper Manhattan, one of the first public housing projects in the nation. They attended Abyssinian Baptist Church, where Pierce sang in the choir. At age 9, she was baptized at the church. =Education= Pierce attended P.S. 46 in Manhattan, Edward W. Stitt Junior High School 164, and the Lincoln Park Honor School of the High School of Commerce in New York. She graduated from Brooklyn College and Hunter College in New York with a B.A. and M.S. degrees in Education in 1955 and 1963, respectively. She went on to earn a Juris Doctorate degree from Rutgers University School of Law in Newark in 1980. While attending, she became a member of The Association of Black Law Students. In addition, she received a post graduate certificate in management and administration from Harvard University in 1988. A lifelong learner, Pierce studied Asian and Hispanic art history at the graduate school of Georgia State University, and African art at Emory University and the University of London‚Äôs School of Oriental and African Studies. Pierce's educational pursuits extend beyond the formal classroom, particularly her studies in the African Diaspora history. Early exposure to Africa was provided when as a child her paternal aunt, Dorothy DeLeaver Gibrilla, who was from the small town of White Stone, Virginia, married Claudius Adelejou Gibrilla of Sierra Leone, West Africa in 1937. When his country declared independence from Britain, Claude Gibrilla was named Consul General for New York. Pierce developed an appreciation of African-Americans' relationship to Africa through her frequent interactions with the Gibrillas. Mrs. Gibrilla gave Pierce the Yoruba name Modupe, meaning ‚ÄúI give thanks to God for watching over me.‚Äù Pierce's interest in the condition of black lives throughout the African Diaspora and the effects of African culture on the world later influenced her research projects and lectures. =Early career= Pierce began her professional career in 1955 as an elementary school teacher and guidance counselor in Harlem public schools. In 1965, upon completing her master's degree in educational counseling, she was recruited by Hunter College High School for the Gifted to assist them in the integration of larger numbers of black students into that exclusive institution. In 1968, she resigned her position at Hunter to accept a position of Assistant to the Dean of the Faculty and Director of Human Resources at Barnard College, the elite women‚Äôs college at Columbia University in New York. Pressured by the civil rights movement, and student sit-ins at Hamilton Hall, Barnard was faced with the need to enroll a more diverse student body at its Ivy League institution. To assist them with this campus-wide transition, Pierce became the first black administrator at the college. During her 3-year tenure, she negotiated a landmark, peer enforced drug-free policy for black students at this institution. Black women enrolled at Barnard organized under the name of Barnard Organization of Soul Sisters (B.O.S.S.) and became the first organized group of black students at the college. B.O.S.S. urged the college to develop a more culturally inclusive curriculum. As a result, the college newspaper, Columbia Spectator reported that Barnard College would establish an Afro-American major. While there, Pierce coordinated supportive services for these women, and for faculty, and carefully documented the evolution of B.O.S.S, which developed lasting friendships with many of the students. Among the many talented women attending Barnard at the time were author Thulani Davis and acclaimed playwright Ntozake Shange (Paulette Williams). =1970‚Äì1990= After her resignation from Barnard College in 1971, Pierce renewed her guidance counselor license and returned briefly to the Harlem public schools. In 1976, she began what would become a long term association with the Berlitz School of Languages, the world‚Äôs premier provider of foreign language services. Pierce began as an instructor at the Berlitz Center in New York teaching English. In 1981, she was recruited as a Berlitz management trainee and was assigned to manage Berlitz operations in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1984, she was promoted to District Director of the New England Region (based in Boston) where she was responsible for sales, operations, human resources and the management of a Fortune 500 corporate client portfolio for Berlitz in four states. In 1990, Lemoine Pierce was recruited as a Senior Associate by D.J. Miller & Associates (DJMA) a management consulting firm, when she relocated to Atlanta. There she researched government procurement policies and programs as a result of a landmark Supreme Court decision in Crosen v. City of Richmond. The case was a result of Mayor Maynard Jackson and his staff launching his Minority Business Enterprise (MBWE) program in 1973. MBWE required that all contractors doing business with the City of Atlanta in the future would have to demonstrate that a percentage of the work would be done by teams that included women and minority contractors. This affirmative action municipal government contracting program (the first in United States history) became the model throughout the country. However, in 1989, the program was successfully challenged and deemed unconstitutional. Subsequently, cities throughout the nation were required to conduct disparity studies to provide proof of past societal discrimination in the construction industry that would justify the need for MBWE programs. Because of this experience with Maynard Jackson, DJMA was the national expert on the design and implementation of disparity studies. Pierce was assigned to research and write portions of several of the firm‚Äôs disparity studies. Following upon her work at DJMA, and her involvement with the development of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) programs in Georgia and throughout the United States, Pierce was recruited as an instructor by Morris Brown College. In 1996, she became a full-time professor in their newly formed Legal Studies program, the first such degree- granting program for undergraduates at an historically black college. She was tenured as an Associate Professor of Legal Studies. =1991‚Äì2004= In the continuation of DeLeaver's career, she had experience in divorce and child custody counselling. She was a consultant at the National Association of Black Social Workers. DeLeaver went on to be a consultant on the International Conflict Resolution Georgia Council for International Visitor, conducting dispute resolution seminars for visiting delegations across the world. She became a domestic violence consultant for the U.S. Naval Air Station, and also went back to teaching as a professor in several Georgia colleges and universities. She was an adjunct professor in the Department of Political Science and International Affairs at Kennasaw State University (KSU). She taught business law at the Mack J Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University (GSU) in 2004. =Research and published works= From the mid-1990s to early 2000s, DeLeaver was working on a research project involving the Georgia Department of Corrections. She was examining and researching the Bureau of Justice's special reports involving women and the impact of incarcerated parents on their children. Much of DeLeaver's research and lectures were connected to her interests in the African Diaspora. In 1989, she was very curious about a thesis published in Zurich, Switzerland in 1975 by Fredrick R. Gutafuson called, \\"The Black Madonna of Einstedein: A Psychology Perspective.\\" She wrote to the author requesting a copy of the original manuscript and he responded with a hand written note. He also included suggestions about other books to further her study: Zimmer's \\"Myths & Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization\\" and Woodman's \\"The Pregnant Virgin.\\" DeLeaver was once the editor of the monthly publication Cues & Views. She has published manuscripts including: * \\"Standards of Conduct for Mediators\\" (American Arbitration Association/ American Bar Association/ Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution. 1994.) * \\"The Significance of Silence in the Resolution of Conflict: Western & Non Western Cultures\\" (College of Law, GSU, 1994) * \\"Child Custody Concerns of Sentenced Mothers in Georgia\\" (a research project commissioned by the Division of Women's Services, Georgia Department of Corrections) In 2004, Hampton published DeLeaver's biographical essay on Charles Alston in the Hampton University Museum of Fine Arts' International Journal of African American Art. Her most notable book is \\"Out From the Clusters.\\" It is a monogram of the role of urban counselors. Copies of the book were distributed to every member of Congress and to the mayors in every city with a population over 50,000 as part of a book series review on the \\"Negro.\\" =Organizations and recognition= DeLeaver became a member of the Phi Delta Kappa sorority in 1957. She joined the Teacher's Retirement System of the City of New York on September 22, 1959. She was a member of the Biglow Society, an honorary organization recognizing the generosity of individuals during their lifetime. DeLeaver went on to receive the Keller School of Graduate Management Certificate for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 1999. She has served on the Boards of: the New York City Mission Society; The West Side Planned Parenthood Association; The Harlem Prep School; and Presbyterian Life Magazine, the national publication of the United Presbyterian Church. In 1994, DeLeaver received the President's Award for Outstanding Contributions in the Field of Dispute Resolution from the International Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution. She was the founding director of the Family Mediation Association of Georgia. =Personal life= Lemoine DeLeaver tended to go by the nickname \\"Lee.\\" In 1961, she filed for divorce from her first husband Mr. Pierce in Mexico. At the time, the only grounds for divorce in New York was adultery. Since that was not the case and DeLeaver was on a \\"tight budget\\" she took a Greyhound bus to El Paso, Texas, which was in walking distance to a Mexican town. In September 1964, she was having issues regarding child support from Mr. Pierce as recorded by a probation officer, Dorthy Brenton, writing to the then, Mrs. Lee Callender. Deleaver and Pierce had two children together, William and Leslie. Lemoine DeLeaver Pierce married Dr. Eugene Callender on April 14, 1963 in New York, New York. On Saturday, June 27, 1970, New York Amsterdam News announced a column entitled, \\"Callenders Split; She Moves Out.\\" In the column, DeLeaver Pierce told Amsterdam News, \\"it was because of gross incompatibility... an accumulation of many irreconcilable differences.\\" Their separation agreement was filed January 8, 1974, followed by a file for divorce on August 15 and a divorce judgement March 31, 1975. DeLeaver made no request for financial support because she was employed at Barnard College during their marriage and continued to work after they separated. She left the marriage with her two children William (15) and Leslie (13). References *Robert W.

The burgstall is freely accessible at all times and is used today as a viewing point.  Location  The small, former hill castle is located within the Franconian Switzerland-Veldenstein Forest Nature Park about 750 metres north-northeast of the village of L√ºtzelsdorf. It stands at a height of about on the Diederichstein rocks whose sides drop vertically into the valley of the Trubach about eleven kilometres northeast of Forchheim.Location of the burgstall at Bayern-Atlas Close by, on the Kreuzberg, lies another burgstall or former castle site, the Schl√ºsselstein, probably founded by the Schl√ºsselbergs. Immediately west of Ebermannstadt is yet another, unnamed, burgstall, designed as a high motte. To the east lay the former castle of Wolkenstein, today a ruin with just a few surviving remains, and the fallen tower castle of Eberhardstein on a rock pinnacle. There is another castle site, Stadtmers B√ºrg, on the Hetzelfels rocks.For the two last- named castles see: Walter Heinz: Ehemalige Adelssitze im Trubachtal, pp. 226 ff. and 232 ff. A bit further away is the old castle site of Wichsenstein above the eponymous village of Wichsenstein, today an observation point with far-reaching views.  History  When exactly Dietrichstein Castle was built is not known; the only written record of it dates to the year 1355. At that time the castle probably no longer existed. One clue to the age of the little castle could be its name: Nuremberg Castle researcher, Hellmut Kunstmann, has established that castles in East Francia that combine a personal name with the word Stein (\\"rock\\") are usually very old. Examples include Pottenstein, which was founded around 1070, G√∂√üweinstein, first mentioned in 1076 and Hiltpoltstein Castle which was built before 1100. Other examples are Egloffstein, Leupoldstein, Eberhardstein, Wichsenstein and Gernotenstein. The shape of the castle foundations also suggest it is old. Its almost circular site is separated on the northeastern side by a semi-circular moat from the somewhat lower-lying plateau. On the other sides, the castle was guarded by the steep rock faces. The castle could not have withstood an enemy armed with cannons attacking on a broad front from the plateau because they would have had a wide avenue of approach. Thus it was probably built in the second half of the 11th century before the invention of gunpowder. This is underlined by the discovery of pieces of pottery that date to the period between the 11th and early 13th centuries. The builder of the castle is also unknown. According to Kunstmann, he could have come from the family of the lords of Wiesenthau; the first member of this noble family is Bero of Wiesenthau who was named in 1128. The name Dietrich first surfaces in connexion with this family in the year 1156. However, the lords of Dietrichstein from Carinthia could also have been responsible. They are mentioned several times as a Bamberg ministeriales family who were witnesses in deeds and as citizens in legal cases that related to Upper Franconia. They could have built a castle here and named themselves after their family castle of Dietrichstein Castle in Carinthia. However, there is no written evidence to confirm either theory. The only written record of the castle was made on 22 February 1355, when Henry Wolf and his wife, Alheid sold to the Bamberg cathedral chapter the manor of L√ºtzelsdorf, which they had inherited from their cousin Conrad Wolf, \\"with all rights and those estates on the Dytrichstein which Conrad Wolf owned himself\\" for 320 pounds of heller. The Wolfs were presumably a side branch of the lords of Wiesenthau; in 1375 they were also in possession of the nearby schloss in Pretzfeld. According to the deed, the castle was an allod of the Wolf family.Hellmut Kunstmann: Die Burgen der s√ºdwestlichen Fr√§nkischen Schweiz, pp. 262 ff. In 1977, several wall remains of the burgstall were uncovered and conserved or, in places, restored.Walter Heinz: Ehemalige Adelssitze im Trubachtal, p. 264 The monument is listed by the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection as a \\"medieval burgstall\\" with index number D-4-6233-0307.  Description  The now levelled castle once stood on the edge of the plateau where it drops vertically into the valley of the Trubach. A small rocky spur, which projects south from the rock face, was divided by a semi-circular moat. This striking ditch, which may have been formed as the result of a rockslide, was further extended during the construction of the castle. Today it has a width of 12 to 14 metres and still has a depth of about five metres. At the ends of the moat, which run up to the rockface of the plateau, there are almost no signs of any rubble heaps, an indication of the natural formation of the ditch. At the northern end of the ditch the plateau descends a little, so that the floor of the ditch and the terrain in front of it were at the same level. Here a wall was built to hinder an enemy wanting to enter the moat. A 17-metre-long section of this rampart still remains, running along the outer edge of the moat before turning inwards to form a barrier at the side. The rampart here is still about 0.5 metres high and three metres wide. The moat lies along the northeastern side of the almost circular castle site. The other sides were protected from attack by vertical rock faces. The old access to the castle was probably on the eastern side of the castle plateau near the present ascent, which runs up several steps from the ditch. The circular plateau of the castle has a diameter of about 35 metres and its surface is level. On the north, east and part of the south sides, the restored enceinte may still be seen. Two low mounds in the northwestern part of the castle are probably the remains of buildings. A section of restored wall has survived. In the southeastern part of the castle, near the former entrance, is a 1.5-metre-wide wall. According to Kunstmann this is the remnant of a thick-walled tower, perhaps the old bergfried of the castle. Because, in restoring the wall remains, the wall space was not filled, it looks like a double wall today. To the west are the wall remains, up to two metres high, of another building that exactly follows the edge of the rock. In the south, there is a rocky crevice, 1 to 1.5 metres wide, which is now covered by four stone slabs. It was presumably used by the castle residents as a store for important provisions; a feature of many castles.Walter Heinz: Ehemalige Adelssitze im Trubachtal, pp. 264 ff.

Kettenbach's writings were popular, in large part, because he wrote in a conversational or common German. Like other reformers of the time, he emphasized the need to print the Bible in vernacular languages like German, and Kettenbach's own writings were entirely in German. He wrote and preached for a reformed church, removed from the abuses of priests, monks and popes, and could at times write colloquially or vulgarly to convey his message.Peter Matheson, Rhetoric of the Reformation, (1998), pp. 81-111. In July of 1522, Kettenbach fled Ulm for Bamberg. Kettenbach seems to have fled for fear of greater persecution at the hands of the unsympathetic monks of Ulm, as he was unable to deliver a sermon he had written fore his departure. Kettenbach was probably still alive in 1523, as printers in Germany continued to publish newer writings, but by 1524 the trail runs cold. Kettenbach was a shortlived participant in the flurry of writings that accompanied the first decade of the Reformation in Germany. He was certainly one of the more popular writers, and his works were eagerly purchased across the Empire. He may have traveled to Luther's Wittenberg, but he most likely passed away sometime between 1523-1524.

Maupin (1863‚Äì1948) was a newspaper man from Nebraska who worked for papers like the Omaha World-Herald, The Commoner, and the Hastings Democrat.  Early life  Born August 31, 1863 in Callaway County, Missouri Maupin's family supported the northern cause and moved to the Illinois during the war where his father joined the Union Army. After the war the family moved back to Missouri where Maupin was educated until he decided to leave school and start working at the local paper. In May 1879 Maupin took his first job at the Republican Holt County Sentinel working to edit articles and there began his sixty year career in the publishing world. During the next ten years Maupin acted as a typographical tourist traveling around the continent writing and publishing articles in places as far as Winnipeg, Canada and Caracas, Venezuela. After living the tramp lifestyle Maupin settled for the first time and published his own newspaper the Meteor in Holt, Missouri just across the river from Falls City, Nebraska.  Nebraska publishing  In 1886 Maupin moved to Nebraska and began his career here by working for the Falls City Journal and the Fall City News. After being in the state for only a few months he attempted to start his second newspaper in Rulo, Nebraska the Rulo Weekly Bridgeman but the paper lasted for less than six months and Maupin was once again on the move. Finding himself in Miden, Nebraska Maupin worked for the Kearney Country Gazette and the Hastings Independent. Over the next few years Maupin moved around the state, again attempted to start another newspaper, and was once more unsuccessful. In November 1890 Maupin accepted the position as the Lincoln correspondent for the Omaha World-Herald and by 1893 the entire family moved from Minden to Lincoln with Maupin's place at the Herald firmly held. Maupin's work with the Herald turned quickly to the work of a political correspondent. In addition, while the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition was in Omaha Maupin covered the event. Along with his political work Maupin wrote the popular \\"Limnings\\" column for the paper that included editorials, anecdotes, and poems. In 1898 Maupin collated and created new stories from the column and published the book Limnings and enjoyed a fair amount of success, both monetarily and professionally, from the book. However even after its publishing Maupin always saw himself as a newspaperman rather than an author. During his coverage of the Democratic national convention in 1900 Maupin was to introduced to William Jennings Bryan. When the first issue of Bryan's The Commoner was published Maupin's new column \\"Whether Common Or Not\\". The column was like \\"Limnings\\" but this new version for The Commoner included more direct political comments. Maupin supported much of Bryan's political agenda and it is noted that him time at The Commoner was notably some of the happiest and most stable years of his life.  Later years  After all of his years of working as a newspaper man Maurpin began getting involved with community politics and in 1918 served as director of the Bureau of Publicity under the Nebraska Conservation and Welfare Commission. In addition, he served as a custodian of the Scotts Bluff National Monument. Maupin would then return to writing and created a column called \\"Sunny Side Up\\" for the Omaha Bee that followed in his \\"Limnings\\" and \\"Whether Common or Not\\" column aspects. In 1934, Maupin ran successfully for the State Railway Commission. However, his public service work would never be enough to fulfill his life and after his term expired Maupin returned to newspapering, editing the Clay County Sun until his death in 1948.

Its earliest surviving manuscript, Paris, BnF lat. 5716, was written in the Carolingian period for Count Conrad by the Scribe Haimo in the Loire region in the second half of the ninth century.Mckitterick, Rosamond. History and Memory in the Carolingian World. Cambridge ; New York, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 26. More fully title is Historiarum Alexandri Magni Macedonis Libri Qui Supersunt, \\"All the Books That Survive of the Histories of Alexander the Great of Macedon\\". Manuscripts and editions Historiae survives in 123 codices, or bound manuscripts, all deriving from an original in the 9th century. As it was a partial text, already missing large pieces, they are partial as well. They vary in condition. Some are more partial than others, with lacunae that developed since the 9th century. The original contained ten libri, \\"books,\\" equivalent to our chapters. Book I and II are missing, along with any Introduction that might have been expected according to ancient custom. There are gaps in V, VI, and X. Many loci, or \\"places,\\" throughout are obscure, subject to interpretation or emendation in the name of restoration. The work enjoyed popularity in the High Middle Ages. It is the main source for a genre of tales termed the Alexander Romance (some say romances); for example, Walter of Chatillon's epic poem Alexandreis, which was written in the style of Virgil's Aeneid. These romances spilled over into the Renaissance, especially of Italy, where Curtius was idolized. Painters, such as Paolo Veronese and Charles Le Brun, painted scenes from Curtius. The Editio Princeps, or first printed edition, was published in 1470 or 1471 at Venice by Vindelinus Spirensis. A slow but steady stream of editions appeared subsequently until more of a need for standardization was perceived. In 1867 Edmund Hedicke instigated a convention that persists yet. He based his edition of that year on the five best manuscripts.. They are B for Bernensis, F for Florentinus, L for Leidensis, P for Parisinus, and V for Vosianus. The vulgate authors In what remains of his work, Curtius mainly does not identify sources. They were, perhaps, stated in the missing books. Speculations of what they were based on thorough analysis of the content and style vary widely. Yardley and Heckel say: \\"The internal evidence for Curtius' sources is disappointing.\\". He does, however, mention Cleitarchus, a historian in camp, twice,9.5.21, 9.18.15. Ptolemy once, and Timagenes once. These men were participants in the Alexander story and therefore are counted as eyewitnesses, or primary sources. All accounts based on them are by analogy also termed \\"primary.\\" identifies five: Curtius, Diodorus Siculus Book 17; Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, \\"Philippic History,\\" Books 11-12 (in epitome by Justin); Arrian, Anabasis Alexandri, and Plutarch, \\"Life of Alexander.\\" These works are also called \\"the Vulgate.\\" Alexander‚Äôs historical archives section Alexander's headquarters included a historical archives unit. Of lowest rank were clerks whose task it was to collect information about the day's operations and events, probably in the form of written notes. This information was reported to an officer in charge of keeping the ephemerides, ‚ÄúDay Journal,‚Äù a record of the army's doings similar to a ship's log. For most of Alexander's expedition, the officer was Diodotus of Erythrae, who remained of such low rank that he is only mentioned once anywhere. His commanding officer, Eumenes, was a Hetairos, a trusted companion of Alexander. Once the Day Journal was completed for the day, it was made available to the army's official historian, Callisthenes, a grand-nephew of Aristotle. He and Alexander were both peripatetics. Callisthenes was not the only officer to take an interest in the Day Journal. Cleitarchus was writing a history, and so was Ptolemy. The two were together in Alexandria, Egypt, after the Partition of Babylon. The next generation of historians, such as Timagenes and Arrian, were to make extensive use of the Day Journal, as well as of the histories of Callisthenes and Ptolemy. Callisthenes came to a bad end through his resistance to adopting Persian customs promulgated by Alexander as part of his programme for building a multi-ethnic state. Some of the journal was lost by him on the Indus River. Eumenes switched to being an infantry officer after the death of Alexander. In the Partition, he went with Perdiccas, to share his evil fate. The Day Journal was continued, presumably under Diodotus and the clerks. Strattis of Olynthus subsequently wrote a work about it. Despite Alexander's care, the Day Journal is missing without a trace except for the works of the writers who used it. For the most part they went with Ptolemy, the ultimate victor in the Wars of the Diadochi. He did the most also to perpetuate the traditions of the Lyceum, Aristotle's school, building a library and a research center grander than any that had gone before, and inviting there personally any peripatetics that he encountered during his maritime hegemony. He went out of his way and spared no expense to obtain the best engineers, mathematicians and philosophers. It is only because of his pro-active efforts and those of his librarians that so many ancient writings have survived. Later, Curtius could have found his primary sources nowhere else. The library was subsequently lost, but it had done its work in disseminating Greek scholarship throughout the Graeco-Roman world.  Author and dating  Curtius Rufus served as Consul Suffectus at 43 AD under the emperor Claudius. He must have written the Histories in the year or two before the consulship. Tacitus says that he was on the staff of the Quaestor of Africa during that time, which would have given him the opportunity to use the Library of Alexandria.Annales, Book XI, Section 21. Tiberius had died in 37; Caligula was emperor then. Curtius‚Äô relations with Caligula are not mentioned. But Caligula was not in his vicinity. On Curtius‚Äô return, a book such as the Historiae unless politically incorrect would have impressed the scholarly Claudius. Tiberius already had been an admirer before the book: he said that Curtius Rufus was his own ancestor; i.e., a self-made man. Tacitus hints that Curtius was of low birth, possibly the son of a gladiator. The story is only compatible with the name if one assumes adoption, which Tiberius could easily have arranged.

World War II service Squadron 16 was first established in World War II. It was credited with sinking more than 500,000 tons of enemy shipping. It was deactivated following the war. In the course of its service, the Squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and six Navy Unit Commendations. Cold War service Squadron 16 was recommissioned in Charleston, South Carolina on October 18, 1963 and was given command of the second nuclear-missile submarine squadron to exist in the US Navy. The Squadron was deployed to Rota, Spain on January 28, 1964, from which it conducted routine deterrent patrols. Between early 1970 and January 1974, the Squadron's submarines were converted to handle the Poseidon missile, replacing the previously used Polaris missile. Following treaty renegotiations between the United States and Spain in 1975, Squadron 16 withdrew from Rota and moved to the Kings Bay Naval Base in southeastern Georgia.

History In 1175 the Freiherr von Weissenburg was first mentioned as a land holder and vassal of Duke Berthold IV of Z√§hringen. Whether they had a castle at this time is not recorded. When he assumed the title in 1259, Rudolf III of Weissenburg expanded and repaired Weissenburg Castle to its full size. Beginning in the 13th century, the Weissenburgs began to expand their Herrschaft. Around 1250 they added Wimmis to their territory, followed by Weissenau Castle in Unterseen and the villages of Rothenfluh and Balm a few years later. However, Rudolf III sought closer relations with the Habsburgs which made an enemy of the nearby town of Bern. In 1288 he lost a battle at Wimmis against Bern and the village was plundered. Ten years later he quarreled with the Habsburgs and the Counts of Neu-Kyburg and lost control over the Rothenfluh and Weissenau Castles. Then, in 1303, he fought Bern again, this time protecting Wimmis.Burgenwelt.org Weissenburg Castle accessed 30 November 2016 Rudolf's son, Johann the Elder, was able to continue expanding the family holdings, adding part of the Hasli valley, Oberhofen Castle and Unspunnen Castle. However, in 1334 he suffered a decisive defeat against Bern and was forced to acknowledge Bern as overlord over the castle and Herrschaft. When his son Johann the Younger died in 1368, the Weissenburg line died out and their estates were inherited by the Lords of Brandis. In the mid-15th century the Lords of Brandis sold all their land holdings in the Bernese Oberland including Weissenburg Castle to Bern. Under Bernese rule, Wimmis Castle became the administrative center of the Niedersimmental and Weissenburg was abandoned. Over the following centuries the castle walls were demolished to provide construction material for houses in the village. Castle site Remains of the round tower The castle is located on a steep hill west of Weissenburg village near the confluence of the Bunsch stream and the Simme river. The castle is protected on three sides by the steep hill, while the gentler west side is guarded by a still visible ditch. Above the ditch portions of a round tower are still visible. The massive south wall and gate are still standing. East of the castle, the foundations of several small houses of the medieval town can be seen.

History  = Spanish Inquisition = = Francoism =  Basque nationalism  Some media linked to Basque nationalism, in particular some linked to the abertzale left, have been object of censorship. During the decade of 1990, the national police investigated the alleged relation between the basque newspaper Egin and the armed group ETA. The newspaper closed in 1998 by order of the judge Baltasar Garz√≥n. In 2009, the court resolved that the activity of the newspaper was legal. However, after 11 years of closure, the newspaper could not open again. After the closure of Egin, one of its journalist, Pepe Rei, continued his work in the Ardi Beltza magazine, which in 2001 was closed by order of Baltasar Garz√≥n too. This order was later revoked. In 2003, Juan del Olmo, judge of the Audiencia Nacional, orderer the temporary closure the newspaper Egunkaria during six month, and the embargo of all its property, with an accusation of being part of a business conglomerate controlled by ETA. The closure order was repeatedly extended during seven years, until all accused were absolved in 2010. In January 2011, the Audiencia Nacional ordered the closure of the website Apurtu.org. In 2013 the case was dismissed but the website never opened again. One of the arrested during the case, Miguel √Ångel Llamas, spent 18 months in prison without a trial. One month before the dismissal of the case, the Audiencia Nacional ordered the closure of the website Ateak Ireki, considering it the successor of Apurtu.org. After the dismissal of the Apurtu.org, the precautionary measures against Ateak Ireki remained. In order to avoid a long legal process to open Ateak Ireki, a new project was crowdfunded to open a new online media project. The result of it was the news portal Ahotsa.info. In 2013, the Audiencia Nacional closed a local online newspaper of Burlada, BurtlataHerria, accusing the administrator of apology of terrorism.

Biography James Crossley Eno was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, the son of James Eno and Elizabeth Eno, who kept a small general shop. He apprenticed as a druggist, and in 1846, at the end of his apprenticeship joined the staff of a local infirmary as dispenser of prescriptions. Eno Logo Building constructed for Eno in 1898 in Gatehead, across the river from Newcastle upon Tyne Eno's 'Fruit Salt' advertisement At some point he met the Newcastle physician Dennis Embleton, who often prescribed an effervescent compound of sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. Mixtures of this type, combining a fruit acid with a carbonate or tartrate, were known as fruit salts, and they were marketed for a wide range of ailments, only a few of which (e.g. indigestion) they could actually ameliorate. Eno set up his own pharmacy in the Groat Market area of town and in 1852 began selling his own fruit salt mixture. Eno gave away his compound to seafarers at the port, and in this way the name Eno became associated with fruit salts around the world. In 1868, he formally founded the company Eno's \\"Fruit Salt\\" Works. With the success of his fruit salts, Eno's business outgrew its premises, and in 1876 he established a larger factory in the New Cross district of London. He himself eventually settled in Dulwich, where he died at the age of 95. Eno's success spawned many competitors in both Great Britain and the United States, but Eno's fruit salts continued to be popular. As the pharmaceutical industry moved away from cure-all patent medicines in the mid 20th century, Eno Fruit Salt became one of the only surviving products of its kind. Currently owned by GlaxoSmithKline, Eno Fruit Salt is today sold as an antacid, and its main ingredients are now sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and citric acid. Its main market is in India. Personal life Eno married Elizabeth Anne Cooke and they had a daughter, Amy. Amy married Harold William Swithinbank. Their granddaughter Isobel Cripps was an overseas aid organizer, his great-granddaughter Peggy Cripps was a children's book author, and his great-great-grandson Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at Princeton.

It is a major metabolite of nandrolone and is formed from it by the actions of the enzyme 5Œ±-reductase analogously to the formation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from testosterone. When testosterone is 5Œ±-reduced into DHT, which is a much more potent AAS in comparison, its effects are potentiated on a local level. The tissues in which this occurs (i.e., the tissues that express 5Œ±-reductase) are referred to as \\"androgenic\\" tissues and include the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, among others. The conversion of testosterone into DHT is an important factor in the etiology of a variety of androgen-dependent conditions, including acne, excessive facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, prostate enlargement, and prostate cancer. Unlike the case of testosterone and DHT, 5Œ±-DHN is a much weaker agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) than is nandrolone. For this reason, instead of local potentiation in androgenic tissues, there is a local inactivation when nandrolone is converted into 5Œ±-DHN by 5Œ±-reductase in these tissues. This is thought to be largely or completely responsible for the exceptionally high ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects seen with nandrolone. The combination of nandrolone with a 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor like finasteride or dutasteride will block the conversion of nandrolone into 5Œ±-DHN and, unlike with testosterone and various other AAS, thereby considerably increase the propensity of nandrolone for producing androgenic side effects.

(born 20 January 1942), is a Trinidadian writer and publisher.  Life  G√©rard was born on 20 January 1942 in Port of Spain as the only child of Joseph and Margaret Besson. His father was a white plantation overseer, his coloured mother worked in the oil industry. After the early separation of his parents, he grew up in the Catholic, Patois-speaking household of his maternal grandmother. After elementary school, he attended St. Thomas High School in Belmont until the age of 15 when he started working in insurance and in manufacturing companies. After he received an inheritance on the death of his grandmother he travelled to Europe and Great Britain where he unavailingly tried to gain ground as a painter and writer. After his return to Trinidad, he worked as a copywriter for various advertising agencies. In the late 1960s, he attracted attention by using black models to advertise high-priced products, a novelty in Trinidad. In 1973, he founded his own advertising agency together with Clive Bradley. In the same year, he married Sheelagh Hezekiah with whom he has three sons. From 1979 until 1985, he served for seven years on the St. Augustine Campus Council of the University of the West Indies (UWI). At the beginning of the 1980s, Besson was a member of a circle of writers and historians around Olga Mavrogordato, widow of Colonel Arthur Stephen Mavrogordato. This group, of which Anthony de Verteuil und Michael Anthony were also members, was dedicated to publishing works about the history and cultural traditions of Trinidad and Tobago. In 1981, Besson founded the publishing company Paria Publishing, initially focussed on republishing of out-of-print works on the history of Trinidad and Tobago. In the following 35 years, he produced and published more than 130 books, many of which non-fiction books by Trinidadian historians. From 1982 to 1985, Besson was a director of the National Museum and Art Gallery in Port of Spain. In 1995, Besson's advertising agency was acquired by Lonsdale Saatchi & Saatchi; Besson himself remained as creative director. In 1996, he got divorced from his first wife, and, in 1998, he married German- born Alice Schwarz. Besson retired from Lonsdale Saatchi & Saatchi in 2002 but continued to contribute to the cultural life in Trinidad. In the 2000s, he curated exhibitions in several museums such as in the Museum at the House of Angostura (2001‚Äì03), in the Heritage Library (2004) and in the National Museum and Art Gallery (2007). In 2005, he was appointed to the board of the National Trust and served on the advisory council for the setting up of an Academy of Arts, Letters, Culture and Public Affairs of the University of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2011, he was appointed to serve on the Equal Opportunities Commission by Trinidadian president George Maxwell Richards and continued to work for the commission until 2014. Besson is a member of the Association of Caribbean Historians.  Works  Besson's works as a historian cover various aspects of Trinidadian and Tobagonian history and culture which can partly be traced back to research assignments from various companies and institutions. A core element of his fictional work is the history of the Afro-French-Creole presence in Trinidad and Tobago and the wider Caribbean, the ethnic group from which his family originates. This topic is being dealt with in his novels The Voice in the Govi and From the Gates of Aksum. The storylines of his novels are fictitious, but the backgrounds are historical, especially in Roume de St. Laurent ‚Ä¶ A Memoir. This novel depicts the life of Philippe Rose Roume de Saint-Laurent, a French adventurer who had a significant influence on the development of Spanish Trinidad in the late 18th century. Roume was instrumental in the promulgation of the cedula de populacion of 1783 in the Caribbean, an edict of Spanish minister Jos√© de G√°lvez y Gallardo that allowed for the settlement of Catholics in Trinidad. This edict created a remarkable increase in the population of the island, mostly French-speaking colonists. In 2000 and 2001, Besson wrote and produced The Land of Beginnings, a monthly supplement to Trinidadian newspaper Newsday that dealt with historical topics and appeared for 24 months. Trinidadian TV channel TTT financed the production of The Land of Beginnings as a threepart documentary. His 2010 non-fiction book The Cult of Will was the subject of controversy, as it sought to deconstruct the narrative of former Trinidad and Tobago prime minister Eric Williams with regard to the emancipation of the slaves in the British Empire. Besson maintains the Caribbean History Archives, a private weblog where he collects new findings on Trinidadian history.

He was an executive director of Pro Wrestling Noah. Sumo career In July 1961, Haruka Eigen began wrestling as a sumo. He was part of the Tatsunami stable. He quit sumo in May 1965, after nearly four years. His highest rank was Makushita 71st. Professional wrestling career =Tokyo Pro Wrestling (1966‚Äì1967)= Trained by former sumos Toyonobori and Mr. Hito at the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance Dojo, Eigen followed Antonio Inoki to form Tokyo Pro Wrestling, where he debuted on October 12, 1966, against future rival Masao Kimura. After a brief interpromotional feud with International Wrestling Enterprise, however, Tokyo Pro folded and he followed Inoki to JWA. =Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (1967‚Äì1973)= Eigen joined JWA in 1967 and was further trained by former judoka Seiji Sakaguchi. After spending six years struggling on the undercard, he finally left JWA in 1973, and the promotion soon folded. =New Japan Pro Wrestling (1973‚Äì1984)= After leaving JWA in 1973, Eigen intended to join Sakaguchi in New Japan Pro Wrestling. Beforehand, he went on an excursion in the United States. While there, he wrestled in the Central States area, under the name The Great Togo (not to be confused with Kazuo Okamura, who wrestled under the same name), wrestling mainly in Kansas City and St. Louis. In March 1973, he won his first championship, the NWA North American Tag Team Championship, with Tokyo Joe (his mentor, Mr. Hito). They would hold onto the titles for about a month, until the titles were abandoned, making them the last holders of the titles. Upon returning to Japan full-time with NJPW, Eigen became a solid hand for the undercard and mid-card matches. In 1979, he would bounce back and forth between NJPW and IWE. Teaming with Strong Kobayashi, they won the IWA World Tag Team Championship in June 1980. They would hold onto the titles for over two weeks before losing them to Animal Hamaguchi and Mighty Inoue. Upon returning to NJPW on a full-time basis after a year, he began to feel disenchanted. He rekindled his feud with Rusher Kimura beginning in 1981 when Kimura joined NJPW after IWE closed. In 1983, he joined Riki Choshu's Ishin Gundan. A year later, he followed Choshu in leaving NJPW, after following Inoki for nearly two decades. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (1984‚Äì2000)= Joining All Japan Pro Wrestling in September 1984, he was part of the Japan Pro-Wrestling satellite, until it dissolved in March 1987. He chose to remain alongside Yoshiaki Yatsu and Shinichi Nakano. All the while he feuded with Rusher Kimura; their last singles match happened on April 9, 1987. On May 12, 1989, Kimura and Eigen faced each other within a six-man tag team match, their first undercard six-man bout; Eigen, along with Masanobu Fuchi and Motoshi Okuma lost to Kimura, Giant Baba and Akira Taue. Since then, he had primarily used in multi-man tag team matches and comedy matches, mostly partnering with Fuchi and opposing Kimura, Baba and Mitsuo Momota. He would remain with All Japan until the Pro Wrestling Noah exodus in June 2000, ending his nearly sixteen-year run with AJPW. =Pro Wrestling Noah (2000‚Äì2006)= In August 2000, Eigen joined Pro Wrestling Noah. However, like in AJPW since the dissolution of Japan Pro Wrestling, he was mainly used for multi-man tag team matches and comedy matches. However, in January 2005, he was given a shot at the GHC Openweight Hardcore Championship against Naomichi Marufuji, but narrowly lost. He wrestled his last match of his career on March 26, 2006, teaming with Jun Akiyama, in a loss to Akira Taue and Masao Inoue. Retirement and death After retiring, Eigen focused on his work as executive director of Pro Wrestling Noah, overseeing sales and marketing. In July 2009, a month after Mitsuharu Misawa's death, he resigned as a director and retired as a counselor for the promotion's board of directors. In September 2010, Eigen returned as a member of the GHC Championship committee. However, a ticket scandal with the Yakuza forced him to resign from the committee in March 2012 and was demoted into a general employee, as was general manager Ryu Nakata. Eigen and Nakata had ties with the Yakuza between 2003 and 2010. On November 28, 2016, Eigen died at his home at the age of 70. Originally, it was reported that he suffered a fall in the bathroom, but it was later confirmed that the fall was caused by a heart attack.

Located at 2400 Tulane Avenue across the street from the Dixie Brewing Company, Nick's Bar operated until Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. The bar was opened after Prohibition ended. The business grew to include the bar, an Italian grocery and delicatessen, liquor store, and beer garden. In September 1965 Hurricane Betsy damaged the property and only the bar remained. Mr. Nick was well known in New Orleans as \\"a mixologist.\\" He was best known for the Pousse-Caf√©, in which liqueurs are layered by specific gravity, and he was known to have layered 34 different liqueurs in a small Pousse-Caf√© glass. (The challenge in pouring a Pousse-Caf√© would be to do so slowly, to assure that liqueurs \\"stack\\" and do not mix.) The bar was called the \\"Big Train\\" because Nick was known to purchase liquor by the trainload in the 1930s, at a time when other bars didn't do so. A mural depicting a fast-moving train, modern for the time and passing a \\"Dixie 45\\" road sign, presided over the bar. Mr. Nick developed a reputation as a raconteur and showman, and enjoyed entertaining patrons with demonstrations, regularly offering samples of drinks after pouring the main glasses from the metal shaker. The Big Train Bar was known not only for Mr. Nick's Pousse-Caf√©, but also for his other mixed drinks, many of which featured liqueurs hand-shaken with whole cream. The drink menu eventually totaled over 150 exotic drinks, often with playfully suggestive names (for the time), like the \\"Pregnant Canary\\" and \\"Between the Sheets,\\" in addition to the \\"Banana Banshee,\\" \\"Ruptured Duck,\\" \\"Wedding Cake,\\" and \\"Chocolate Soldier.\\" After Castrogiovanni's death, additional drinks were devised such as, the \\"Underwater Demolition,\\" \\"Nick's Bullet\\" and \\"War Eagle\\" with subsequent more overtly pornographic names (\\"1-800-****-ME UP,\\" \\"Twisted Nipple,\\" \\"Screaming Orgasm,\\" \\"12 Italian Virgins in the Back Seat of A Volkswagen,\\" \\"Peeking Through Grass Skirts,\\" \\"A Wild Night At The Capri Motel\\" [a reference to the motel next door on Tulane Avenue], and names referencing undergarments).

Nick's Original Big Train Bar was frequented by Dixie brewery employees, blue collar workers, businessmen, Tulane and LSU Medical School faculty, college, medical, and law students, tourists, politicians, and movie stars. The Paramount Pictures distributorship had been located across Tulane Avenue, and movie stars and celebrities including John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, and Laurel and Hardy had visited the bar. In its later years, the bar developed a reputation as a \\"dive bar\\"In the Land of Cocktails. Harper Collins. p. 9. Quote: \\"Nick Castrogiovanni's Big Train Bar was a serious dive even by New Orleans standards. Each successive generation, including ours, thought they discovered it, and were always surprised to learn that their parents had been there before them.\\" . The atmosphere changed considerably under managers after Mr. Nick's death in 1979, as the character of the bar became wildly unrestrained without Mr. Nick's firm control of behavior in his establishment. Promotional \\"All You Can Drink\\" nights were featured, with some drinks served in outrageous containers such as a miniature toilet bowl. Well- attended, especially by college fraternities and sororities, busloads arrived from as far away as Mississippi. At one time in the 1980s, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) took a public stance against the Nick's Bar \\"All You Can Drink\\" nights. Eventually, Nick's Original Big Train Bar was purchased by Nick's grandson, but the bar was destroyed by water during Hurricane Katrina and was later demolished. Plans to rebuild the bar have appeared on various news sites.

Like other Haredi newspapers, it is not published on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath), but instead is put out as an expanded weekend edition. Hapeles was founded through the encouragement of Shmuel Auerbach, leader of the Jerusalem Faction, an Israeli-Haredi political organisation. History Hapeles is a continuation of the ideology underlying line adopted by the founders of the newspaper Yated Ne'eman. Yated Ne'eman was part of a broad initiative to create communal organizations to serve the Lithuanian Torah community. Yated Ne'eman rejected secular life and displayed an ambivalent attitude towards the State of Israel and Zionism. They recognized them as a de facto political entity, but denied that Zionism was the destiny of the Jewish people. Instead the newspaper emphasized pious observance of the mitzvot of the Torah and Jewish law. In 2012 the paper was taken over by more moderate ultra-Orthodox elements. The CEO, the editor-in-chief and some of its guiding rabbinical board members (the \\"spiritual committee\\"), who were considered to represent the more strict ideological line, were fired during the changes. Hapeles was created to continue the original direction of Yated Ne'eman. The dismissed CEO and chief editor were appointed to those positions on the new paper.

Biography  His father was a slate quarrier. He showed an early talent for drawing and took lessons from a local artist named Couthouly before enrolling at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in 1868, with financial assistance from a local magistrate (coincidentally also named Capdevielle, although not related) and a subsidy from the Lourdes Municipal Council. His primary instructor there was the painter and sculptor, Aim√© Millet. In 1870, absorbed in his studies, he neglected to present himself for the sortition at the beginning of the Franco- Prussian War. As a result, he was arbitrarily assigned to an infantry regiment and served in the Arm√©e de la Loire. Spaniards After being demobilized, he returned to the √âcole; pursuing studies with Alexandre Cabanel and L√©on Bonnat. He got married in 1873 and, the following year, had his first showing at the Salon. In 1876, he was awarded a travel grant to study in Spain and displayed the works he created there at the Salon of 1877. His wife died prematurely in 1878, shortly after he had been called up for a new round of military exercises. He remarried in 1880 and one of his sons from this marriage, Raoul (1880-1910), also became a painter. In 1886, anticipating a special \\"Salon Triennal\\", he obtained a grant from the city of Lourdes to create a large canvas depicting the Miracle in the Grotto. Despite his working continuously for a year, it was not ready in time. Faced with a stalled career and chronic financial problems, he returned to Lourdes in 1890. Once settled there, he turned to portrait painting. Most of his sitters were from the local bourgeoisie, but he also painted √âmile Zola, during his visit there in 1892 to do research for his novel Lourdes. About that same time, he met Cyprien Pintat, a restaurant and hotel owner from Luz-Saint-Sauveur. He and his prominent Andorran family became major patrons. Apart from brief trips to Spain and London, he lived a quiet life in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es until his death in 1905.

They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.  History  Original Brisbane Grammar School at Roma Street, 1874 The Brisbane Grammar School, constituted under the Grammar School Act 1860‚Äì1864, was officially opened on 1 February 1869 under the headmastership of Thomas Harlin. It was the second Grammar School established in Queensland under the 1860 Grammar Schools Act (Ipswich Grammar School was the first). The first buildings designed by architect Benjamin Backhouse with later additions by Richard George Suter were erected on a site along Roma Street and were demolished in 1911. Following the expansion of the railway network, the school moved to the present site on Gregory Terrace. The foundation stone was laid by the Chairman of Trustees, Hon Charles Lilley on 28 November 1879. The site granted by the Queensland Government in 1878 was bounded on three sides by Gregory Terrace, College Road (then known as New Road), and the railway line. In addition the School was granted by the government a piece of land across the railway line for a sporting ground and a corresponding area was excised from the south west corner of the Gregory Terrace site. Arranging of the drive and tree planting including the planting of an avenue of Moreton Bay Figs along the main drive was carried out at the new site by School Trustee and founding member of the Acclimatisation Society Lewis Adolphus Bernays. In 1918 the figs on the northern side of the drive were replaced by cocos palms. In 1881, students moved to the new school. The Main Building, comprising the Great Hall with single storeyed wings of classrooms on either side, was designed by architect James Cowlishaw. It was built to face College Road, overlooking the city and the old school. In the same year two Moreton Bay figs were planted by Prince Albert and Prince George (later King George V) in the drive. Not until the opening in 1887 of the School House, designed by architect Richard Gailey, was accommodation provided for boarders within the school grounds. The three storeyed School House also provided accommodation for headmaster, Reginald Heber Roe and his family. In 1909 Roe resigned to become the Inspector General and Chief Educational Advisor in the Department of Public Instruction and former deputy Frederick Sydney Newman Bousfield became headmaster. In the same year, additions and alterations by architect George David Payne were carried out to the School House. Payne, who was the father of two boys at the school, was also responsible for the 1912 additions to the Main Building comprising a chemistry laboratory and physics laboratory which were erected at a cost of less than and for the New Building erected in 1916 by the Works Department at a cost of . At this time levelling of the hill wicket was carried out. Later, in 1925 the Works Department carried out further work at the school with the addition of a second floor to the classroom wings of the Main Building. On 11 August 1921, a World War I trophy, a \\"German\\" field gun donated to the school by old boy, Brigadier General Lachlan Chisholm Wilson, was unveiled. The War Memorial Library was opened on Armistice Day 1924 by Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan. Built as a memorial to some 1,020 members of the School who served during World War I, it was erected to the design of architect John Barr, who had succeeded in a competition held amongst old boys of the school and subscribers to the War Memorial fund. In 1928, former deputy Stuart Stephenson was appointed Headmaster and an appeal was launched to transform the Hill Wicket into a new turf cricket ground. The new turf which was levelled under the unemployment scheme was opened in 1932. In 1931 part of the oval was excised for the making of Gilcrest Avenue and in return the school was granted a portion of Victoria Park. With the depression, direct government funding and indirect funding via state scholarships was reduced. In the mid 1930s various improvements financed by government grant were undertaken and Brisbane City Council workmen beautified the approach and entrance to the school grounds with gardens, lawns, and rockeries. Old boy George Carson-Cooling was appointed Headmaster in 1940 and was followed by Henry Robert Pigott in 1948. The oval across Gilcrest Avenue was leased from 1948-1966 to Ballymore. In the early 1950s beautification of the grounds was undertaken including planting shrubs on the frontage facing Brisbane; levelling part of the entrance road; making gardens at the gate and around the School House; a low stone wall and garden beds were made by fathers in 1955 to the College Road entrance; a start was made on filling up part of \\"no man's land\\" between boys and girls school to make a new playing field; and the main football ground was extended to full size with space for a running track and miniature rifle range. In 1953, Allen Ernest McLucas was appointed Headmaster. In that year the Frank Walker Gymnasium was opened and in the following year, the Old Boys Second World War Memorial Swimming Pool was opened. Harold Frederick Newell was appointed Head in 1956. New entrance gates were erected in 1959 and a new science block opened in 1960. In 1961 a players pavilion was erected on the oval and in the following year the headmaster moved from the School House to a brick residence erected in the grounds. In 1963, a wing of four classrooms was added to the Main Building and the Newell Quadrangle was completed by the following year. The Centenary Building Project was announced in 1964. It included the building of the Centennial Hall and the Library. Other work included the construction of Advanced Science Laboratories (1965); the conversion of the Science Wing into administration offices and masters common room (1966), the Manual Training Building (1967); additions to the School House (1972); the Humanities Building (1975); the addition of two floors to the Manual Training Building to become the Language Laboratory (1981); and the Music Auditorium (1982). In 1982 the permanent closure of Kalinga Avenue between the Brisbane Grammar School and Brisbane Girls Grammar School was granted. In 1992, the Old Correspondence School, located on what was intended as part of the original endowment land, was purchased from the Queensland Government. = Main Building = Main Building, 1889 The Main Building, comprising the Great Hall and classroom wings, was designed by architect James Cowlishaw and erected in 1880 with a second floor added to the classroom wings by the Public Works Department in 1925. It was the first building to be erected at the Brisbane Grammar School's new Gregory Terrace site. With the expansion of the Roma Street railway yards, the school was forced to move to a new location selected on Gregory Terrace. On 28 November 1879 the foundation stone was laid by Chairman of Trustees and school benefactor, the Hon Charles Lilley. By 1881, the new building costing some , had been completed by contractor, W MacFarlane. A detached wooden cottage was also erected for the caretaker and included a dining room for the pupils. Like the Main Building, this featured the use of the quatrefoil motif. The new school overlooked both the old school site and the city. Its hill top location was considered salubrious and picturesque. Cowlishaw's Collegiate Gothic design provided for a large central hall, with single storeyed classroom wings on either side. It was brick and roofed with banded Bangor slates with cast iron cresting on the ridges. The main entry, facing the city, was by a covered carriage porch of Oamaru stone bearing a number of carvings, and which led to the Great Hall. Inside, the ceiling was coloured sky blue and decorated with hundreds of gold stars. Soon after the opening the large stained glass windows, funded by subscriptions, were installed. Made by Ferguson and Urie of Melbourne, they are thought to be the earliest Australian produced windows in Queensland. Both windows are used to portray the ideals of the school. The northern window shows a young Queen Victoria flanked by men famous in British history, including maritime and military leaders, statesmen, poets, playwrights, and men of science, who look down on the boys inviting them to \\"emulate their noble deeds\\". The theme of the southern grisaille window speaks of the rewards bestowed by the Crown for loyalty and service. On either side of the Great Hall were the class room wings including Headmaster's office and science laboratory. As in the Great Hall, the ceilings and rafters of these rooms were coloured. In 1912, the Science Wing comprising chemistry and physics laboratories was added to the eastern wing by architect GD Payne. Major additions were undertaken in 1925, when a second floor containing ten new classrooms was added to what had previously been the single storeyed class room wings. In 1924, in response to rising enrolments, the Trustees of the school wrote to the Queensland Government Architect requesting that plans be prepared for eight additional classrooms. A proposal to extend the New Building was considered by the Public Works Department where the Chief Architect at the time was William James Ewart, an old boy. In the following year the plan was rejected in favour of a proposal by old boy architect Arnold Edwin Brooks, to add the second floor. The proposal was considered by the Trustees to further dignify the architectural beauty of the building. It was also considered cheaper than the erection of a separate building. Leonard James Kempster of the Public Works Department modified that proposal to enable the existing ground floor to be altered as little as possible thereby retaining the ground floor. The work, which cost involved the raising of the existing roof to form the roof of the second storey and included the removal of fireplaces and chimneys and the replacement of the slate tiled roof. In 1935, under architect Thomas Ramsay Hall, an old boy, the slate roof of the Great Hall was renewed and the outside walls repaired. The stained glass window designed by William Bustard and executed by RS Exton was unveiled in 1951. It was donated by the Old Boys in memory of Maud Carson-Cooling, the wife of Headmaster George Carson-Cooling. Various works were undertaken during the mid 1950s, under the supervision of Professor Robert Percy Cummings including the repair of the roof of the main building, the renovation of the cloisters, the releading of the stained glass windows of the Great Hall; and the repainting of the interior of the Hall in an array of colours including the 500 gold stars on the ceiling. In response to changes in education policy, in 1963, a two-storeyed addition was made to the western wing consisting of 4 classrooms to accommodate what amounted to a double intake for the following year. Lining the walls of the Great Hall are a number of honour boards and memorials. These include a bronze memorial plate designed by old boy architect Robin Dods in 1897 in memory of school benefactor Sir Charles Lilley. In 1902 Dods also designed the cedar TJ Byrnes Honour Board, erected in memory of an old boy and former Premier of Queensland, Thomas Joseph Byrnes. In 1938, the Honour Board was extended with two lateral wings to Dods' original design. In 1916, an Honour Board, designed by TR Hall containing the names of 640 old boys who joined the Imperial forces during World War I was unveiled together with tablets to Lt Colonel Hubert Jennings Imrie Harris and Captain Thomas Joseph Brundrit. In 1949, the World War II honour board, designed by old boy architect Dean Stocker Prangley, was unveiled. In the 1950s reorganisation of the interior of the Hall to accommodate the various memorials was carried out including the moving of the TJ Byrnes Honour Board. Although now too small for entire gatherings of the school, the Great Hall remains a central symbol of it. The original classrooms are predominantly used as staff rooms. = School House = The School House is a three storeyed brick building designed by architect Richard Gailey, and erected in 1887 to provide on site accommodation for boarders as well as a Headmaster's residence. Prior to the erection of the School House, boarders at the School were housed off the school grounds, in the residences of masters and later nearby the residence of Headmaster Roe. In about 1883 plans for a boarding house were prepared by the architect of the Main Building, James Cowlishaw. Cowlishaw's proposal was not proceeded with, however, as the estimated cost of exceeded the budget by some . Cowlishaw did however recommend to the Trustees that his former Clerk of Works, Richard Gailey be approached. Gailey's plans forwarded to the School in September 1885 provided for a three storeyed red-and-white brick building. The headmaster's residence occupied the main floor; with service and dining areas in the lower floor and the boys housed on the top floor which was divided into numerous cubicles. Gailey's planning of the entries to the School House was strategic. Access by the boys to the building was via a bridge to the headmasters residence on the main floor from where the staircase lead to the floors above and below, giving the Headmaster complete control over the movement of his charges. Separate entry to the Headmaster's residence was provided from the southern side of the building. A Treasury loan of some was made for the erection of the School House which was opened in January 1887, the contractor being H Holmes (). In 1909, architect and father of two Brisbane Grammar School boys, GD Payne was commissioned to design alterations and additions to the School House. This was to be the first of Payne's works for the school. Later he was to design the Science Wing added to the Main Building and the New Building. His work to the School House included a single-storeyed timber-framed building for servants' accommodation and ancillary facilities; on the lower story a larger dining room where the matron, laundry and common room were previously located; conversion of the former dining room to boys' prep room and former servants' quarters into additional study area, and the addition of single storeyed timber framed verandah to the northern end of the building housing a store, larder, and dairy. Alterations to the main and top floor, consisting of conversion of part of the headmaster's residence into boys' dormitory accommodation, and on the upper floor rearrangement of partitions and upgrading of showers and lavatories, may also have been carried out at this time, but were certainly completed by 1925. During the 1930s the School House was repainted and improvements carried out. In the 1950s the slate roof was replaced by tiles. In 1962, a separate house was erected for the Headmaster and the headmaster moved from the School House. In 1972, the three-storeyed reinforced-concrete dormitory wing, erected on the northern end of the School House by architect Colin Trapp, was opened. = Administration Building = The Administration Building is a two storeyed brick building adjoining the eastern classroom wing of the Main Building, which was erected as a science block in 1912 the design of architect GD Payne. The Main Building erected in 1880 contained a science laboratory; however the Science Wing was intended for the \\"more thorough experimental teaching of science\\". The Science Wing was the first classroom addition carried out at the school since its opening at the Gregory Terrace site. George Payne was also to be responsible for the design of further school buildings with the erection of the New Building in 1916. In 1909 Payne, who had two boys at the school, had also designed additions and alterations to the School House. Payne's Science Wing was a contemporary and complementary interpretation of Cowlishaw's Collegiate Gothic building, in brick with light-coloured dressings, and high pointed arch coloured and leaded pane windows. It contained a large chemistry laboratory and smaller physics laboratory with timber galleries. These classrooms were impressive double- storey height spaces with exposed roof structures, and clerestory lighting and ventilation. The cost of was funded by the selling of endowment lands and a grant from Treasury for equipment. The Science Wing was opened on 26 July 1912 by the Governor Sir William MacGregor, a strong supporter of education and the advancement of science, and the school's Visitor. In 1928 a bellcote designed by architect AE Brooks, an old boy, was erected by the Old Boys of the school in memory of school janitor and ringer of bells, George Rylatt. A water fountain designed by architect TR Hall, an old boy, was erected to the south of the building in memory of Graham Murray Lumsden, who was killed during World War II. This was moved to the eastern side in 1964. As part of the school's centenary building program, Payne's Science Wing was converted into an Administration Building by school architect Colin Trapp. The new work was opened in 1966. = New Building = The New Building, a two storeyed brick building designed for the Trustees of the Brisbane Grammar School by Architect GD Payne, was erected by the Public Works Department in 1916 at a cost of some on the northern side of the Main Building overlooking the oval. The New Building (as it is still known) was erected in response to the increasing numbers of enrolments at the School. Like other Grammar Schools, the Brisbane Grammar School was largely dependent for its enrolments on boys who were in receipt of State Scholarships. In 1914, a change in the policy of the awarding of those Scholarships occurred resulting in an increasing number of recipients and hence an increasing number of enrolments at the school. In response to this increase, the Trustees requested the Government to erect extra class room accommodation and forwarded a proposal by school architect GD Payne. Payne, who had two boys at the School, had already designed additions to the School House as well as the Science Wing added to the Main Building in 1912. His sketch plans show a two-storeyed building containing eight classrooms (including a chemistry and physics laboratory) connected by a covered way to a block of toilets. He proposed a timber building with fibro cement linings and a roof of red fibro cement slates with the cost including retaining wall to be . Payne's siting of the proposed new building took advantage of the aspect offered to the north as well as visually linking the Main Building and the later Science Wing, whilst maintaining the primacy of the Main Building. Funding for the new building was to be provided by the government and responsibility for its erection passed to the Public Works Department. Some modifications were made to Payne's plans in 1914 by the Public Works Department; however Payne's scheme was substantially retained including his selected site. Works Department drawings by Harold James Parr included a central corridor and stair and some changes to the size of rooms. Costings were prepared by the Department for both a brick () and a timber () building; however in September 1914 tenders were called for the erection of the brick building. The contractor for the works carried out during 1915 was John MacArthur of Toowong with joinery by Pattersons of Toowong and tiles and cement ceilings by Ladgrove. In 1954, the repainting of the New Building was supervised by Professor Cumming, who was also responsible for the colour scheme at the Great Hall. Cumming's colour scheme was described by the school magazine as being something out of the ordinary and of an almost bewildering diversity. With the extensions of the oval during the 1950s, the verandahs of the New Building became and remain a grandstand for spectators of school sporting events about this time. The classrooms, particularly those on the ends of the upper floor are regarded as the best in the School. = War Memorial Library = The Memorial Library, erected to the design of architect John Barr, an old boy, as a memorial to old boys who served in World War I, was opened on Armistice Day 1924. On 14 August 1916, an Honour Board, which at that time recorded the names of 640 old boys who joined the Imperial Forces during the Great War, was unveiled in the Great Hall. On that day a meeting was held at which it was resolved to erect a more substantial memorial and subscriptions were opened. The War Memorial Building Committee, chaired by the Chairman of Trustees, John Laskey Woolcock was formed, and the canvassing for funds was commenced but soon deferred due to the Federal War Precautions Act which required the conservation of resources for the war effort. Various forms of memorial were considered by the Committee. Unable to erect a chapel, due to the constraints of the Grammar School Act, the subscribers chose a useful monument, a library. In 1919, on the recommendation of a subcommittee consisting of Edward Robert Crouch, Thomas Ramsay Hall, and Henry Wallace Atkinson, it was decided that a building of \\"approved Gothic design\\" be erected in the school grounds to be used as a war record room and library. The site chosen by the subcommittee was on the south side of the drive facing College Road; however this was changed in October 1920 to the existing site so as to save costs on the foundations. At this time a number of architects, who were either old boys of the school or subscribers to the fund were approached for designs. Their brief required a building of Gothic 13th/14th century design with two lancet windows in each face with medallion or three lancet windows in each face with the windows to start from above floor level. Architect GHM Addison was enlisted to consider five of the eight schemes submitted. Addison recommended the scheme submitted by John Barr be awarded first prize, with an entry by Ronald Martin Wilson awarded second prize. Barr was in practice in New South Wales. He designed the old Fisher Library (now the Nicholson Museum) and later was to win another memorial competition, this time at the Melbourne Grammar School. As Barr was resident in Sydney, he arranged for another old boy and former pupil of Addison, architect AE Brooks, to supervise the construction of the building. Tenders for the erection of the building were first called in February 1923; however no tender was accepted and tenders were recalled with some modifications of the original plan in April. The tender of Peter Frew of was accepted which provided for the substitution of concrete for freestone in parapets, iron for copper dormers, and solid walls in place of hollow. On Anzac Day 1923, the foundation stone was laid by the School Visitor and State Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan. Beneath the stone was buried the same bottle as was placed under the foundation stone of the original school in Roma Street in 1868. In December 1923 the committee resolved that a uniform design for the stained glass windows be adopted with the window over the doorway to be representative of Victory (Saint George) and over the opposite door to be representative of Peace. Those windows were subscribed to by the Trustees and the Old Boys Association respectively. The other chivalric virtues chosen by the Committee to be represented in the windows were justice, magnanimity, courtesy, honour, service, fortitude, reverence, loyalty, duty, and truth. These were subscribed to by families and others in memory of sons, brothers, and friends and were designed and executed by Charles Tute. Tute is also believed to have executed the library furniture which was probably designed by Barr. It included four bookcases to stand at right angles to piers, six benches and tables, six chairs, and the Crystal Cabinet, which housed the Golden Book, comprising four volumes bound in brown Moroccan leather by the Government Printer. The Book records, on pages framed with red Flanders poppies drawn by one of the daughters of Headmaster Roe, Madge Roe, the names of 1,020 Brisbane Grammar School volunteers as written by the President of the Old Boys Association, CB Fox. An octagonal display case was also made by long-time master, Alfred John Mason. The memorial was intended to house a great reference library and books were donated in memory of the fallen. Other books donated included signed volumes written by old boys. Signed photographs of wartime political and military leaders from various parts of the Empire were also sought and placed around the walls. Many of the original contents of the Library are still in the possession of the school or have been reacquired. The War Memorial Library is now maintained by the school as a memorial and museum. = Old Correspondence School = The Old Correspondence School is a two storeyed red brick building erected in 1899 by the Works Department for the Department of Agriculture for use as a Stock Institute, and was acquired by the Brisbane Grammar School from the Queensland Government in 1992. The Queensland Stock Institute was established as part of the Stock Branch of the Colonial Secretary's Department in 1893 to research the nature and origin of stock diseases and to develop preventative measures against these. It was the first Stock Institute in Australia. The first premises of the Institute were in Turbot Street, Brisbane. The first Director, microbiologist, Charles Joseph Pound was known for his work on various animal and human diseases, most particularly for his work on tick fever. In 1897 the Stock Branch was transferred to the Department of Agriculture where Pound renewed his complaints regarding the unsuitability of the Turbot Street building. By the following year, plans for new premises had been completed by the Public Works Department. The new building erected on College Road by contractor William Herd for , contained on the ground floor, laboratories and a photographic room and on the second floor, a museum, and a lecture and specimen room. An animal yard containing sheds and stalls was erected at the rear. To the front, timber steps were constructed leading down to College Road. The new site provided the Stock Institute with a prominent position overlooking the city with ready access to transport, both rail and road. The site adjoined the Brisbane Grammar School and had been intended to form part of the 1878 grant to the Trustees of the Brisbane Grammar School. In 1877, it was excised from the proposed grant and exchanged for land more suitable for use as a sports ground. In 1901 the Stock Institute was transferred to the Home Secretary's Department. In that year a timber post mortem room and more stables and sheds were built in the grounds. Now known as the Bacteriological Institute, with Charles Pound as the Government Bacteriologist, its work included research into human diseases, the examination of water samples, and the preparation of pathological samples. During the plague epidemics of the first decade of the 20th century plague work was undertaken, and complaints were received from the adjoining Grammar School regarding the hazards of keeping rats on premises so close to the school's boarding house. In 1907, the Bacteriological Institute was returned to the newly renamed Department of Agriculture and Stock although work was still done for the Health Department. Sydney Dodd was appointed Principal Veterinary Surgeon and Bacteriologist. Under pressure from the Queensland branch of the British Medical Association the Institute was again transferred to the Health Department in 1909 where it became the Laboratory of Pathology and Microbiology under the directorship of Dr John D Harris. Work continued on research into human diseases, including during World War I, work on the epidemics of meningitis in army camps. All stock related work was undertaken at the newly established Stock Experiment Station at Yeerongpilly. In 1918 the Laboratory relocated to the Old Police Court at South Brisbane. In that year the Queensland Hookworm Campaign was established and soon after the Normanby building became the central office of the campaign under director Dr WA Sawyer. In 1925 the building was converted for use by the Irrigation and Water Supply Commission. A three-storeyed wing designed by the Public Works Department was added at the rear of the building by day labour at a cost of . The addition included in the basement, a printing room and strong rooms. In 1932, the building was converted for the used of the Primary Correspondence School. The school commenced on 1 February 1922 to provide primary school education for children in remote areas. The school was initially based at the Central Technical College with an enrolment of 37 pupils, but in September of that year moved to the former Trades Hall. During World War II, when wartime conditions made it impossible for many children to attend school, enrolments in the Primary Correspondence School rose to a peak of 11,000 with a staff of 150. After the war, the PCS also assisted in establishing rehabilitation schemes for returned service people. With closer settlement, improved transport and provision of more schools, enrolments of the school once known as the biggest in the southern hemisphere, began to decline. The Primary Correspondence School vacated the building in 1979 but remained in use by the Education Department until 1992, when it was acquired by Brisbane Grammar School and renamed the S.W. Griffith Building.  Description  The Brisbane Grammar School is sited on the crest of a ridge that overlooks Albert Park and Roma Street Railway yards to the south, and Victoria Park and Kelvin Grove to the north; the site is bounded by College Road, Gregory Terrace, and the North Coast railway line, and has its main entrance from Gregory Terrace. The siting and architectural character of buildings at Boys Grammar School reinforce a hierarchy of buildings of primary and secondary importance. The \\"primary\\" buildings include the Main Building (1879), the Administration Building (1912) and War Memorial Library (1923), which form a collection of brick Collegiate Gothic buildings with pale masonry dressings and pitched rooves at the centre of the school. They are sited on highest point of the school grounds, a finger-shaped plateau which runs westwards from Gregory Terrace. The central buildings are encircled by \\"secondary\\" buildings which are classrooms and boarder accommodation to the north and the east, sited on the sides of slopes which fall way from the central plateau. These include brick, pitched roof buildings which are complementary in character to the central buildings: the School House (1887), the New Building (1916) and the more recently acquired Correspondence School (1899). The Sports Grounds extend towards the north west at a lower terraced level which has been cut out of the side of the hill. The south of the school is screened from the road with a vegetated embankment. The recent entrance driveway from Gregory Terrace and the symmetrical grouping of new buildings around the axis of the War Memorial Library contrasts with the picturesque grouping of the buildings as seen from the earlier entrance driveway. The grounds contain a number of memorial objects; the \\"German\\" field gun to the south of the Main Building, an octagonal sandstone memorial drinking fountain to the east of the Administration Building, and several plaques to the buildings' exteriors. The grounds also contain a double-storeyed brick and corrugated iron roofed toilet block, sited on an escarpment to the northwest of the Main Building. It has rendered concrete lintels, unglazed high-set openings and a rendered masonry portico. Vegetation features within the grounds include: remains of an avenue of Moreton Bay figs which once led from the school gates to the main buildings (planted 1879); a row of palms which supplanted some of the figs (planted 1918); three \\"royal trees\\" (two planted in 1881 and one in 1968); four pines, seeds of which came from the Lone Pine at Gallipoli on the bank near the \\"German\\" field gun (planted in 1978), several figs to the south west entrance to the oval (1941), and a number of trees planted or donated by eminent people associated with the school. A pair of steel gates hinged from brick posts are located on the south eastern boundary of the school; these gates mark an entry that is no longer in use. A porphyry square-necked rubble wall runs along part of the southern boundary. The Brisbane Grammar School forms an unusually intact collection of buildings, notable for the coherent architectural character and siting logic that has been developed and largely maintained over the years. = Main Building = Sited centrally on the school's highest plateau, with its principal frontage to College Road, the Main Building is a double-storeyed brick Gothic building with rendered masonry and cement dressings and a slate tiled pitched roof. It is a symmetrical building consisting of central Great Hall rising above and flanked by two classroom wings. The wings have a cruciform plan, and their long axes run east‚Äìwest; the Great Hall runs north‚Äìsouth and has an Oamaru stone porch to its south. The building has been extended to the north with a Science Wing (1912) to the eastern end and new classrooms (1963) to the western end. The roof is a series of intersecting pitches which run concurrent with the long axes of the rooms below, and is decorated with a band of fish- tailed slates. The southern frontage to College Road has three double-storeyed projecting bays with parapeted gables and corner buttresses to the Great Hall and end classrooms. The eastern and western frontages have single, central double-storeyed projecting bays, also with corner buttresses and parapeted gables. To the north, only the projecting bay of the Great Hall remains visible. To the south, the projecting bays are spaced with an arcaded awning to the ground floor with a sheet metal roof, rendered masonry spandrels and paired cast iron columns with Collegiate Gothic capitals. The Oamaru stone porch, a single-storeyed aedicule, has arched entry ways to the east and west, surmounted by pediments and flanked by paired half columns, and two arched openings to the south. The columns capitals are richly carved with oak, holly and shamrock leaf motifs. The cornice, pediment and balustrade feature quatrefoil motifs. The northern frontage has timber verandahs giving access to first level classrooms, with squared sheeted spandrel panels, and supported on paired columns with foliate capitals. The verandahs have battened balustrades, raked timber ceilings to the upper level and ripple iron ceilings to ground level. Part of the verandah to the east has been closed in with fibre cement sheeting. The projecting bays to the south, east and west have pairs of pointed arch tracery windows with single rosettes above, with a single larger tracery window to the northern and southern end of the Great Hall. Rectangular windows with pointed arch motifs run between the projecting bays, and the rooms are accessed via timber double doors. Rendered masonry dressings include toothed window surrounds, hood mouldings, cornices with dentils, and copings. The upper level classrooms at the ends of the east and west wings feature timber arched braced trusses springing from semi-circular impost blocks, diagonally boarded timber ceilings with exposed rafters, and timber cornices with quatrefoil motifs. The four classrooms either side of the Great hall on the upper floor and several on the ground floor have sheeted ceilings with dark timber coverstrips. The Great Hall is spanned by similar but more elaborately decorated arched timber trusses to those found in the classrooms, also landing on semi-circular impost blocks. It has a diagonally boarded timber ceiling with exposed rafters and purlins, finished with a timber cornice with pierced motifs. The interior features two large stained glass windows, one at each end of the hall, and one to each side amongst a run of lancet windows. The entrances to the south, east and west have pointed arch cedar double doors. The doors and windows have mouldings, and a stepped dado moulding decorates the north and south walls. The Great Hall contains a number of memorial plaques, and WWI and WWII honour rolls. This impressive primary building of the Grammar School group remains substantially intact in form and detail, retaining its well-crafted features, in particular the upper level classroom and Great Hall interiors, and the Oamaru stone porch. = School House = The School House is a three-storeyed, Gothic-influenced painted brick building, sited on a slope to the west of the Main Building. It has a red terracotta tiled roof, consisting of a central, low pitched hipped portion and more steeply pitched edges intersected by gables. A 1972 boarding house directly adjoins the School House to the north. The building has a rectangular plan, and is entered from the west on the ground floor, and the north, south and east on the first floor. A small loggia connects to the eastern entrance. To the ground and first floors, rooms are accessed from cruciform corridors with stairs to the west and the south. The intersection of the corridors are decorated with rendered masonry arches, and many of the ceilings are timber- boarded. The first floor bay windows are framed internally by a flat arch. The upper floor is an impressive space with exposed timber trusses which span the width of the building. The gable ends of the exterior are expressed internally in the timber-lined ceiling. The exterior has two differing expressions, the eastern and western elevations having an \\"institutional\\" appearance in comparison to the more domestically-scaled southern facade designed as the entrance (previously the headmaster's residence). The eastern and western elevations are symmetrical compositions of gabled bays and paired windows, while the southern elevation features a -storey entry portico with a gable end on the wall above, flanked by bay windows with small tiled roofs. The building has triangular head windows to the upper storey, arched windows to the first floor, and windows with slightly flatter arches to the ground floor. Each gable end has a rounded triangular vent at its peak. The elevations are linked horizontally with projecting brick courses running at floor and sill level. These brick courses consist of diagonally-placed brick ends under a projecting course, framing rectangular motifs. The School House is an integral part of the Grammar School group, exhibiting fine architectural qualities in the composition and brickwork detailing of its exterior, and its impressive interior space to the upper level. = Administration Building = Administration Building (formerly Science Building), 2011 The Science Wing is a two-storeyed Collegiate Gothic building adjoining the eastern wing of the Main Building to the north. Complementing the Main Building in form, the Science Wing is made of brick with light masonry dressings, and employs a similar formal language of parapeted gabled bays with corners buttresses to the north, east and west. It has a pitched tiled roof, with a pyramidal fleche rising above the roof line. The western and eastern elevations consist of single gable ends, with two large pointed arch windows surmounted by three small lancets. The western elevation has a memorial bell-cote, set in a rendered masonry surround with bell suspended above a more recent clock. The northern elevation has a projecting gabled bay with two large pointed arched windows with a rosette above. It is flanked by two single-storeyed gabled bays with rectangular windows. The refurbishment of the building included most of the windows. Leaded glass windows were replaced with steel mullioned windows with concrete spandrel panels and new rendered masonry surrounds, while pointed arched windows to the side walls were replaced with triangular head windows. Originally consisting of three double-storeyed height rooms extending in turn to the west, north, and further out to the east, the building has been divided into two storeys. The ground floor has been partitioned for administrative offices, and the first floor now serves as a meeting area. The fine and impressive timber roof structures of the three major rooms remain visible on the upper floor, being composed of exposed timber blade trusses on quarter-round impost blocks. The ceilings have exposed rafter and purlins over timber boarding. A corner is formed by the continuation of the ceiling along the top of the wall. Despite substantial internal alterations and the replacement of windows, the building remains a fine addition to the Main Building, retaining major elements of its skilfully-designed interior and exterior. = New Building = The New Building is a two-storeyed brick building with timber verandahs, rendered concrete lintels and a fibro-cement tiled gambrel roof. It has a rectangular plan, with its long axis running east‚Äìwest, and is sited immediately to the north of the main building. It has been cut into an escarpment, the result being a reduction of the bulk of the building in relation to the Main Building. It has one storey above ground level to the south, and two storeys above ground level to the north, with unobstructed views over the sports field, Victoria Park and Kelvin Grove. The escarpment has been retained with a brick batter wall. The building is entered from the south via a timber bridge which runs across the batter wall at first floor level. This entrance is marked with a gable end with vertical timber battens, centred tulip motif, and curved valances. The same gable end is featured to the north. The four classrooms to each level are accessed via north and south verandahs, and vertically linked with internal terrazzo stairs. To the south, the verandahs have vertically battened timber balustrades, and timber lattice panels to the lower level. To the north, the timber balustrades have been replaced with chainwire and steel pipe, and the lattice replaced with sheeted timber panels. The timber posts to the gabled ends, and to the east and western ends of the verandahs are paired, and decorated with timber panels with tulip motifs. The verandah ceilings to the upper level are raked, with timber boarding with exposed eaves rafters; the western and eastern ends of the ceilings are finished with triangular panels with vertical battens. The verandahs have ripple iron ceilings to the ground floor. The classrooms are lined and rendered internally, and have sheeted ceilings. All the classrooms are accessed from both sides via timber double doors. The rooms have two types of grided timber windows; paired sliding sash windows, and high-set grided timber windows with an inward tilting panel. Despite alterations to the northern elevation, the building remains an intact example of skilful design with modest decoration achieved within the budgetary constraints of the classroom block type. = War Memorial Library = The War Memorial Library is located immediately to the east of the Main Building, and terminates a vista to the west from Gregory Terrace which is framed by two 1960s buildings. It is a free-standing octagonal Gothic building with stained glass windows, and is made of red brick in English bond with sandstone dressings. It has a steeply pitched slate-tiled octagonal roof covering a single-storeyed space of tall proportions. The building has stepped buttresses at the corners of the octagon, while the faces of the octagon have paired lancet windows alternating with single lancets which have dormers above. The entrances to the building are on the north and south faces through pointed arch timber double doors with carved inscriptions on either side. The sandstone door surrounds feature a gable carved with trefoil motifs above a hood mould. The sandstone battlement also features trefoil motifs, and is punctuated with curved gables surmounting the buttresses. Other sandstone dressings include hood mouldings and toothed surrounds to windows, thin pilasters crowned with small spires which link the dormers to the windows below, and two courses of rough hewn stone at the base. The interior has an elaborate exposed roof structure consisting of small arched trusses springing from sandstone impost blocks, which are centred on brick piers at the corners of the octagons. The trusses meet at a midpoint below the roof pinnacle; the remainder of the roof is supported with struts springing from a central half- post. It has a timber boarded ceiling with exposed rafters, and the dormers are expressed in the ceiling. The room has twelve high-set stained glass windows with sandstone voussoirs encircling the room, as well as four stained glass windows to the dormers. Of the twelve windows, ten feature figures personifying chivalrous virtues; the window over the north door features the figure of peace, while south windows features that of victory. The building contains a number of commemorative plaques, and dark timber furniture with Gothic detailing. The latter consists of the \\"Crystal Cabinet\\", the \\"Octagonal Cabinet\\", a tall glass-fronted cabinet, a smaller glass-fronted cabinet, and a bench. The Memorial Library is a very fine building in concept, composition and detailing. Its substantial and rich symbolic content makes it an unusual feature of a school building group. = Old Correspondence School = S.W. Griffith Building (former Primary Correspondence School), 2015 The Old Correspondence School is located to the west of the School House, on a lower terraced level which falls gently to the west. It is a double-storeyed banded red-brick building with a red corrugated iron hipped roof, fronting onto and rising above College Road. The building consists of two wings; an 1899 wing which runs north‚Äìsouth, with its address to College Road, and an adjoining 1923 wing running east‚Äìwest, which has a semi-basement to the west. The southern elevation has a fine brick and sandstone entrance portico. The northern elevation has a projecting bay with its own pyramid roof, containing toilets, which is linked to the building with an enclosed timber verandah clad in weatherboard. The western elevation has a single-storeyed weatherboard-clad enclosed verandah, while the eastern elevation has a double-storeyed enclosed verandah. The eastern elevation has been extended with a single storeyed weatherboard annex. The brickwork is banded with sandstone courses to the 1899 section, and beige brick courses to the later addition. These courses run above and below the windows, and a deep band of blue-grey brick runs around the base of the entire building. The windows to the upper level have flat arches with splayed brick voussoirs (excepting to the toilet bay). The ground floor windows have square heads with sandstone lintels and keystones to the 1899 section, and splayed brick lintels to the newer section. All openings to the west are protected with corrugated iron sunshades on timber brackets. The entry portico to the south has rusticated brick pilasters flanking a sandstone arch with toothed voussoirs, set in a brick gable end surmounted by a sandstone cornice with dentils. The timber double entrance doors are surmounted by a similar sandstone arch around a glazed fanlight. The interior features two timber staircases, which have timber balustrades with turned newels with rounded terminals. The windows are sliding sash with grided panes to the upper leaves, excluding those to the verandahs and toilet bay. The verandahs are accessed with timber double doors with fanlights. The 1899 section has ripple iron ceilings, while the 1925 section has sheeted ceilings with coverstrips. The southern rooms have views to the city, Petrie Terrace and Paddington. The 1898 building exhibits some fine detailing, and the later addition is successfully complementary in form, character and materials.

Biography Susan Hayhurst was born in Middletown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Quakers Thomas and Martha Hayhurst. She attended school in Wilmington, Delaware and excelled in mathematics. While still a young girl she worked as a teacher at country schools in Bucks County. Taking an interest in chemistry and physiology, she enrolled at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, and went on to graduate with a degree in medicine in 1857. She served as principal of the Friends' School in Philadelphia from 1857 to 1867, and for a time operated her own school which was attended by many of her former students. During the American Civil War, she was chairman of the Committee of Supplies of the Pennsylvania Relief Association. In 1876, Hayhurst became the head of the pharmaceutical department at the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia. To broaden her knowledge of the subject, she began attending lectures at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy. Though Dr. Clara Marshall had previously done so, it was rare for the college to admit women, and Hayhurst was the only woman in her class of 150. The college administration did not offer any resistance, however, and granted her a diploma in pharmacy when she completed her courses in 1883, at age 63. Hayhurst remained in her post at the pharmaceutical department of the Woman's Hospital for 33 years. She supervised the purchase and manufacture of supplies, assisted missionaries to foreign countries, and acted as mentor to 65 women pharmacists. She was a member of organizations such as the New Century Club, New Century Guild, American Academy of Political and Social Science, and Woman's Suffrage Society of Philadelphia. Susan Hayhurst died in Philadelphia on August 7, 1909, after an illness of four days. The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy held a memorial service in her honor on November 15, 1910, and commissioned a painting of her to be hung in its museum.

She was a founding member of the National Association for the Education of Young Children, supervised the Federal Emergency Relief Administration's nursery school program in New England in the 1930s, and co-founded the Eliot Community Mental Health Center in Concord, Massachusetts. The Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts University is named for Eliot and her colleague, Elizabeth W. Pearson.  Early life  Abigail Adams \\"Abby\\" Eliot was born in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston on October 9, 1892, the youngest child of Reverend Christopher Rhodes Eliot and Mary Jackson (May) Eliot. The Eliots were a prominent Boston Brahmin family. Abby's father was a Unitarian minister and her grandfather, William G. Eliot, was the first chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis. Her sister, Martha May Eliot, became a nationally known public health specialist, and her brother, Frederick May Eliot, headed the Unitarian Association of America for many years. The poet, playwright, critic, and Nobel laureate T.S. Eliot was her first cousin. After serving at the First Parish Church of Dorchester on Meeting House Hill for 13 years, Reverend Eliot became the minister and social worker at the Bulfinch Place Church in the West End, and the family moved to 2 West Cedar Street on Beacon Hill. Eliot graduated from the Winsor School, a private preparatory school on Beacon Hill, in 1910. After receiving her A.B. degree from Radcliffe College in 1914, she spent five years doing social work for Associated Charities and the Children's Mission to Children. From 1919 to 1920 she studied at Oxford University, and briefly worked for the Massachusetts Minimum Wage Committee. The Woman's Education Association of Boston sent her to England for six months in 1921 to study the nursery school movement at the Rachel McMillan Nursery School and Training Centre in London, and to prepare herself to start a similar school in Boston.  Career  In January 1922, with the sponsorship the Woman's Education Association, Eliot co-founded the Ruggles Street Nursery School in Roxbury with Boston philanthropist Elizabeth W. Pearson. In addition to teaching children, the school trained teachers in early childhood education. Eliot served as Director until 1952. She also continued her education, earning her Ed.M. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1926 and her Ed.D. in 1930. Eliot became a leading proponent of early childhood education, teaching at the Ruggles School and at Wellesley College and giving frequent talks to parent and church groups. In 1923 she helped found the Cambridge Nursery School. She helped organize the National Association for Nursery Education, which became the National Association for the Education of Young Children, and served for a time as its secretary- treasurer. During the Depression, the Roosevelt Administration's Federal Emergency Relief Administration organized \\"emergency nursery schools\\" for needy children. Eliot became a member of the National Advisory Committee for the program, and supervised its New England operations. The Ruggles Street Nursery School eventually became the Nursery Training School of Boston and moved to 355 Marlboro Street. In 1951 it became the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts University and moved to Medford, Massachusetts. The Eliot-Pearson Award, given biennially to honor outstanding contributions in the field of children's media, is known as the \\"Abby\\".  Later years  After retiring in 1952, Eliot taught for two years at Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena, California. In 1954 she returned to Massachusetts and taught for several years at the Brooks School and Garland Junior College. She served on many boards and committees for child guidance and mental health and on the Radcliffe College Board of Trustees. She also continued to give lectures, and helped found the Walden Clinic, which became the Eliot Community Mental Health Center in Concord, Massachusetts. Eliot's partner for more than 50 years was Anna E. Holman. They shared a house in Concord from 1954 until Holman's death in 1969. She died of a heart attack on October 29, 1992, aged 100, at the New England Deaconess Home in Concord.

This flood became known as The Great St. Patrick‚Äôs Day flood, and also affected other areas of the Mid-Atlantic on both sides of the Eastern Continental Divide.  Flood control  Civic organizations in the city, with financial backing from the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and the Chamber of Commerce had been asking the Federal Government for help with flood control for almost thirty years. They had formed committees to lobby government officials and found themselves caught in political processes that ultimately resulted in the city and its residents sustaining devastating damage. In August 1935, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill for nine flood control reservoirs to be built above Pittsburgh. However, while the Senate debated this bill, the tremendous 1936 flood occurred. The Congress did not actually appropriate any funds for the project until the 1937 flood which threatened, but spared the city and went on to devastate the Ohio River Valley.  Causes  On March 16, 1936, warmer-than-normal temperatures and torrential rain followed a cold and snowy winter, leading to the rapid melting of snow and ice on the upper Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers. They and their tributaries were already over their banks and were threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On Tuesday, March 17, the waters reached flood stage of 25 feet. Heavy rains overnight caused the waters to rise quickly, and on March 18, the water peaked at about 46 feet, 21 feet above flood stage. Four days later, on March 21, the water finally receded to 24 feet.  Aftermath  The aftermath to the city was devastating. About 100,000 buildings were destroyed and the damage was estimated at about $250 million ($ today). Steel mills that were located around the three rivers suffered devastating damage and 60,000 steel workers within a thirty-mile radius were out of work due to the damage that the mills suffered. Sixty five percent of the downtown business district had been under water from the Point all the way up to Grant Street. Electric power failed on March 17 and full electric service was not restored for eight days. KDKA radio was able to broadcast without interruption throughout the flood but Pittsburghers were unable to listen because they did not have electricity to run their radios. The contamination of the water supply led Pittsburgh residents to be told to boil water for fear of a typhoid epidemic. This fear was never realized; whether it was from the boiling of water or just luck is unknown. At least 69 deaths occurred in western Pennsylvania, including 45 in the city. There was no train service because the railroad tracks that ran along the three rivers were blocked or washed away by the flood. Trolleys were also affected by the power loss and some were abandoned where they were when power was lost. Roads around the rivers were washed away or buckled and there was a gasoline shortage because there was no electricity to run the pumps. St. Patrick's Church was able to hold dedication ceremonies on St. Patrick's Day despite the rain, but nearby St. Stanislaus suffered severe flooding and pews were seen floating down the street. The pastor had to be rescued from the second floor. Relief workers consisting of police, firemen and the National Guard secured the city and protected public safety. The absence of electricity caused the pumps at the water intake facility to fail, and left firefighters unable to fight fires. These fires had been burning for days because of the lack of water pressure in the fire hydrants. The Red Cross provided food, clothing and medical supplies, while the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps rescued people from flooded houses and assisted in the cleanup after waters receded. On March 20, days after the initial flooding, receding waters and debris fields caused rumors that the massive 16th Street Bridge had collapsed. Although false, the hysteria forced the Pittsburgh Police to declare all bridges closed until they were spot checked. Many buildings in Pittsburgh, particularly in or near downtown, have markers indicating the height reached by floodwaters. The flood eventually led to calls for the construction of a dam upstream on the Allegheny to prevent future floods of this magnitude. Laws providing for the construction of the dam were passed in 1936 and 1938, but it would take nearly three decades, and a bitter fight with the Seneca Nation of Indians, before the Kinzua Dam was finally completed in 1965. Effects in other areas Washington, DC, experienced floods, including at Navy Yard on the Anacostia River. The Potomac and James Rivers, across the continental divide from the Ohio and its tributaries, also suffered severe flooding during mid-March 1936. Potomac River crossings at Harpers Ferry and Shepherdstown, both in West Virginia, and Hancock and Point of Rocks, both in Maryland, were all destroyed.\\"Point of Rocks Bridge Washed from Moorings\\". The Baltimore Sun (Baltimore: Tribune Company). 1936-03-20. p. 8. Great Falls experienced what were, as of July 2014, its highest floods on record. Washington, DC, saw its airport, Washington-Hoover Airport in Arlington, Virginia, flooded.Grover and Lichtblau, The Floods of March 1936, Photographic Plate 2 (between pp. 34‚Äì35) The effects of the storm also affected the Northeast. Waters raged from New York and Connecticut to New Hampshire and Maine. The Connecticut River reached flood stage at 38 feet, and 28 people died in Connecticut alone, as Hartford was paralyzed by the rising water. The National Guard was called in to save stranded residents. Significant flooding also occurred in New Hampshire, as the Merrimack River crested above 18 feet. In total, storm costs were over $520 million. (equivalent to $6.6 billion in 2015 dollars).

After this, she left her job at UNESCO and traveled abroad to advocate for the disabled. Death and legacy Kanza suffered cardiac arrest and died on 2 April 1999. She was buried in the Luozi Territory. In 2004, Kanza was inducted into the Congo's Pantheon of National History, one of the first women to be accorded the honour. Her bust is displayed the Gallery of Memory. The \\"Cercle Sophie Kanza\\", an association of female professors in the Congo, was named in her honour. Three of Kanza's daughters organized a mass of thanksgiving in honor of herself and her husband in Gombe on 28 March 2015.

He is the son of Norman Casse, one of the founders of OBS (Ocala Breeders Sale) and brother to the trainer Mark Casse. He graduated from Florida State University in 2002 with a bachelor's degree in International Affairs.  Career  Casse's first job post-college was as working as a groom and assistant trainer for his brother, Mark. He followed that up with a stint at the consignment agency Paramount Sales in Lexington, Kentucky. Casse started Casse Sales LLC, a sales consignment agency, at the age of 24, and gradually built the business to include clients such as Eugene Melnyk, John C. Oxley, Zayat Stables, Coolmore Stud, Kinsman Farm, Gary Barber, Earle I. Mack, Stonerside Stable, and Vincent Viola. The first 2-year-old he ever sold, a Rahy filly for George Steinbrenner's Kinsman Farm, brought $500,000. Jim Rome's two-time Breeders' Cup winner Mizdirection was also sold via Casse Sales LLC in 2010 and later achieved $2.7 million at Fasig-Tipton's November 2013 sale. Casse is active as a buyer's agent, pinhooker and consignor. He has been involved in the winners of no less than nine Grade One stakes races. In October 2016, Dancing Rags, sold by Casse on behalf of Kinsman Stud, won the Alcibiades Stakes at Keeneland. Only a day later, Gary Barber's Keep Quiet, bought by Casse for ‚Ç¨37,000 ($45,455) at the 2014 Arqana December sale in France, won the Dixiana Bourbon Stakes. He also purchased an interest in Haveyougoneaway on behalf of Barber and the mare later won the Ballerina Stakes. Barber's 2013 private purchase, Jack Milton, eventually won the Maker's Mark Mile Stakes. Negligee, consigned by Casse, also won the Alcibiades Stakes in 2009. She later sold for $625,000 as a broodmare prospect at the 2011 Keeneland January sale. Lear's Princess, co-pinhooked by Casse with his father, won the Gazelle Stakes at Belmont Park. In November 2013, Casse purchased a weanling by Zensational for Ahmed Zayat, the owner of American Pharoah, for $130,000. The colt was named Justin Squared, for both Casse and Justin Zayat. Justin Squared won the Chick Lang Stakes on the Preakness Stakes undercard in 2016. As a pinhooker, Casse sold the mare Gamay Noir in November 2015 for $1.1 million in foal to Tapit after being purchased for $375,000 nine months earlier. He also purchased a daughter of More Than Ready in September 2016 for $390,000, who achieved $1 million as a two year old in training seven months later. In January 2017, Casse visited Gold Coast, Australia to attend the Magic Millions yearling sale and purchased approximately $1.1million Australian dollars in yearlings with Gai Waterhouse. Ten days later while at Cape Town he purchased the highest- priced yearling filly in the sale, sired by Frankel (horse), for 4 million South African rand. The filly was also Frankel's 3rd highest priced filly in the Southern Hemisphere. Casse's affinity for Frankel was on display later in the year, when he purchased the highest priced yearling to be sold in Ireland at the Goffs Orby sale. That yearling, named Old Glory, was revealed to be trained by Aidan O'Brien in County Tipperary at Ballydoyle. In February 2017, Casse was brought to Sydney, Australia by Inglis Sales company, founded by William Inglis (auctioneer), to advise investors and to develop their two year old in training sales. Later in 2017, after a second-place finish in the Preakness Stakes, it was announced that Coolmore Stud had purchased the stallion breeding rights to Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner and Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse winner Classic Empire in a deal brokered by Justin Casse. In May 2018 in Deauville, France, Casse purchased a 2-Year- Old Colt for Gary Barber by American stallion War Front, later named War of Will (horse). That year War of Will would run second in the Summer Stakes (Canada) and fifth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf, but eventually found his best running on dirt surfaces, despite that his pedigree suggests he would have an affinity for turf racing through the War Front and Sadler's Wells lineage. In early 2019, War of Will would be stabled at Fair Grounds Race Course and eventually win the Lecomte Stakes and the Risen Star Stakes. These victories would place him amongst the best 3-Year-Old Colts in America and make him an early favorite for the 2019 Kentucky Derby. In the Kentucky Derby, drawing post position one, War of Will lost any chance of victory after tangling with winner Maximum Security (horse). Maximum Security was disqualified, and his jockey, Luis Saez, was suspended for 15 days. In the days following, the owners of Maximum Security, Gary and Mary West, filed a lawsuit in federal court asking that the disqualification be reversed. Two weeks later at Pimlico Race Course, War of Will hugged the rail for most of the mile-and-three-sixteenths distance, before scooting to the middle of the track and holding off a challenge from a long shot named Everfast to win the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.

Takayasu which is the east part of Yao, Osaka. The site is designed as a national historic site under the name ‚ÄúTakayasusenzukakofungun‚Äù. History In the central Takayasu ward of Yao city (Chizuka, Yamatake, Okubo, Hattorigawa) about 200 ancient tombs exist. These areas were called \\"Senzuka\\". It is thought that these ancient tombs were constructed from the 6th to 7th century. Some 600 ancient tombs had been discovered by the survey of Taish≈ç period (1912‚Äì1926). Many of the ancient tombs are small round burial mounds, 10‚Äì20 meters in diameter. They are distributed mostly on Mt. Takayasu hillside with a height of 50‚Äì300 meters. Most of the ancient tombs are open in their south side. In these areas, only a few people, those with great political power, constructed circular-shaped ancient tombs with rectangular frontage (=a key hole-shaped tumulus). Their authority became divided during the late Kofun period as small local clans came to expand their power. It is thought that such situation made many ancient tombs to concentrate in this area. The details of the tombs are unknown. In the early Meiji period, Edward Sylvester Morse surveyed and sketched Kaizanzuka-kofun and introduced it as ‚ÄúDolmen ancient tomb of Japan‚Äù. In later research William Gowland tried to take pictures of Nishitsuzuka-kofun (= Double chamber ancient tomb) and published a thesis as ‚ÄúDolmen of double chamber‚Äù. Tsuboi Shougoro published a thesis, \\"Same origin theory of ancient tombs / graves and dolmens\\" in 1888.  ≈åkubo/Yakatake sub-group  Kawachi-dolmen (formal name: ≈åkubo/Yamatake No. 36 kofun) is called \\"Dolmen\\" or \\"Dolmen kofun\\" locally. Its mound was lost, exposing the stone chamber portion. At the end of 2016 bushes surround it. Shuntokumarukagamizuka (formal name: ≈åkubo/Yamatake No. 27 kofun) is located at the south of the graveyard of Raiko-ji in Yao city. As the stone chamber is collapsed, only the passage part remains, forming a tunnel-shape.  Hattorigawa sub-group  Nishitsuzuka-kofun (formal: Hattorigawa No. 25 kofun, popular name: Double chamber dolmen): The mound is collapsed, exposing a part of the stone chamber. Two burial chambers are vertically connected and Nishitsuzuka's name is derived from them. The stone chamber is fragile.  Kourigawa sub-group  Kourigawahigashizuka and Nishituka ancient tombs are widely different from the position to the west. Kaizanzuka-kofun (formal name: kourigawa No. 1 kofun It exists in the ground of Houzo-ji temple): The inner space of the stone chamber is about 15.7 m2. It is the largest in the Takayasu-kofun group. Kourigawahigashizuka-kofun is located about 50m west from Kourigawa crossroad of Japan National Route 170. It is thought that it was constructed at the end of the fifth century. It is a circular‚Äêshaped tomb with rectangular frontage. The northern end has a mound about 50m in diameter. Many buried objects were excavated from the stone chamber at the time of farmland cultivation in 1897. Although an excavational investigation was conducted as an emergency survey for residential development in 2001, the land of Kourigawahigashi-kofun was divided into residential area and it is defunct.

Form The metre comprises paired hemistichs of the following form (where \\"‚Äì\\" represents a long syllable, \\"u\\" a short syllable, and \\" _uu_ \\" one long or two shorts):Classical Arabic Literature: A Library of Arabic Literature Anthology, trans. by Geert Jan van Gelder (New York: New York University Press, 2013), p. xxiv. : u ‚Äì _uu_ ‚Äì  u ‚Äì _uu_ ‚Äì  u ‚Äì ‚Äì  Thus, unlike most classical Arabic metres, wƒÅfir allows the poet to substitute one long syllable for two shorts, an example of the prosodic element known as a biceps. Thus allows wƒÅfir lines to have different numbers of syllables from each other, a characteristic otherwise only found in kƒÅmil, mutadƒÅrik and some forms of basƒ´·π≠.W. Stoetzer, 'Rajaz', in Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature, ed. by Julie Scott Meisami, Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 645-46 (p. 646). WƒÅfir is traditionally represented with the mnemonic (tafƒÅ øƒ´l) ' (). History Historically, wƒÅfir perhaps arose, along with ·π≠awƒ´l and mutaqƒÅrib, from hazaj.Shawkat M. Toorawa, review of Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms: Festschrift for Wolfhart Heinrichs on His 65th Birthday Presented by His Students and Colleagues, ed. by Beatrice Gruendler and Michael Cooperson, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 132 (2012), 491-97 (p. 493), DOI: 10.7817/jameroriesoci.132.3.0491. In the analysis of Salma K. Jayyusi, the Umayyad poet Jarir ibn Atiyah used the metre for about a fifth of his work, and at that time \\"this metre was still fresh and did not carry echoes of great pre-Islamic poets as did ·π≠awƒ´l and ba·π£ƒ´t. WƒÅfir had therefore a great potential for introducing a diction nearer to the spoken language of the Umayyad period.\\"Salma K. Jayyusi, 'Umayyad Poetry', in The Cambridge History of Arabic Literature: Arabic Literature to the End of the Umayyad Period, ed. by A. F. L. Beeston, T. M. Johnstone, R. B. Serjeant and G. R. Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983). The metre, like other Arabic metres, was later borrowed into other poetic traditions.

History Mess uniforms first appeared in the British Army in about 1845, initially utilizing the short shell jacket worn since 1831. This working jacket was worn open over a regimental waistcoat for evening dress.Alastair Campbell, page 57, \\"The Dress of the Royal Artillery, SBN 85368 491 X The original purpose was to provide a relatively comfortable and inexpensive alternative to the stiff and elaborate full-dress uniforms then worn by officers for evening social functions such as regimental dinners or balls. With the general disappearance of full dress uniforms after World War I, mess dress became the most colourful and traditional uniform to be retained by most officers in British and Commonwealth armies. Immediately after World War II the cheaper \\"blue patrols\\" were worn for several years as mess dress, but by 1956 the traditional uniforms had been readopted.Alastair Campbell, page 58, \\"The Dress of the Royal Artillery, SBN 85368 491 X Contemporary usage The formal designation of the most commonly worn mess uniform in the British Army is \\"No. 10 (Temperate) Mess Dress\\". The form varies according to regiment or corps, but generally a short mess jacket is worn, which either fastens at the neck (being cut away to show the waistcoat, this being traditionally the style worn by cavalry regiments and other mounted corps), or is worn with a white shirt and black bow tie (traditionally the usual style for unmounted regiments, corps, and services).Since regimental amalgamations, the \\"cut away\\" or cavalry-style jacket has been adopted by some British Army infantry regiments such as the Royal Regiment of Wales,page 19 \\"Regiment\\" issue thirty - \\"The Royal Regiment of Wales\\", the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers,page 20 \\"Regiment\\" issue twelve - \\"The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers\\", and corps such as the Adjutant General's Corps and the Royal Logistic Corps. Officers of the Foot Guards, Royal Engineers, the Parachute Regiment, the Royal Army Medical Corps, and the Royal Regiment of Scotland amongst others still wear the infantry style of jacket. The colours of mess jackets and trousers reflect those of the traditional full dress uniforms of the regiments in question, as worn until at least 1914. Jackets are, therefore, usually scarlet, dark blue, or rifle green, with collars, cuffs, waistcoats, or lapels in the facing colours of the regiments in question. In the case of those regiments which have undergone amalgamation, features of the former uniforms are often combined. Waistcoats are often richly embroidered, though with modern modifications, such as a core of cotton for gold cording instead of the thick gold cord which made these items very expensive prior to World War II. Non-commissioned officers' mess dress is usually simpler in design, but in the same colours as officers of their regiment. Most British Army regiments' mess dress incorporates high-waisted, very tight trousers known as overalls, the bottoms of which buckle under leather Wellington or George boots. Ornamental spurs are usually worn by cavalry regiments and corps that traditionally were mounted; some other regiments and corps prescribe spurs for field officers, since in former times these officers would have been mounted. The Rifles do not wear spurs at any rank, following Light Infantry traditions since historically no Light Infantry officer rode on horseback. Scottish regiments wear kilts or tartan trews, and some wear tartan waistcoats as well. In \\"No. 11 Warm Weather Mess Dress\\", a white drill hip-length jacket is worn with either a waistcoat in the same material or a cummerbund of regimental pattern. Blue and various shades of red or green are the most common colours for the cummerbund. Trousers or overalls are the same as in No. 10 Dress. Female officers and soldiers wear mess jackets in a pattern similar to those of their male counterparts over dark-coloured ankle-length evening dresses. Black hand bags may be carried, and black evening shoes are worn.

It protects an area of cerrado forest. Location The Matas do Segredo State Park protects a remnant of cerrado forest within the urban area of Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul. It has an area of . The park is the source of many springs that feed the C√≥rrego Segredo. The park adjoins residential neighborhoods to the south and east, and pasture areas to the north and west. The urban areas both put pressure on the park and give it support as one of the few remaining green areas in the city. History In the 1980s the area was known as the Ch√°cara Santa In√™s. Part of it was sold to a company that intended to develop it as a residential area, but this was stopped by the action of neighborhood residents associations, environmentalists and civil society organizations. who proposed expropriation to create a botanical garden for the state capital. Due to bureaucratic problems no action was taken for several years. With the development of large neighborhoods nearby the area suffered from hunting and extraction of forest products. People started fires, and trails had to be opened to give access fire department vehicles, which accelerated the degradation by hunters and gatherers. A proposal was signed on 18 November 1990 to turn the area into a conservation unit, in part to protect the important water sources that it contains. The state governor created the Campo Grande Botanical Garden by decree 7.119/93 of 17 March 1993 to preserve the biodiversity of the cerrado and to protect the water sources. SEMA was given 180 days to start administering the area, but this did not happen. The state government transferred the botanical garden to Matas do Segredo State Park by decree 9.935 of 5 June 2000. The objective is to protect the springs of C√≥rrego Segredo, and the fauna and flora of the cerrado. On 17 April 2015 the State Secretary for Environment and Economic Development inaugurated the visitor center. Environment The K√∂ppen climate classification is Aw, with dry winters and rainy summers. Average annual rainfall is , with least rain in the June‚ÄìAugust period. Random surveys of the vegetation have identified 188 species in 63 families. The greatest number of species were in the family Fabaceae (22), followed by the Rubiaceae (10), Apocynaceae, Bignoniaceae and Sapindaceae (8), and the Annonaceae and Euphorbiaceae (7). There were 10 herbaceous species, 38 shrubs, 111 trees, 24 vines and one parasite. The greatest diversity of species was found in the cerrado areas (96 species), followed by cerrad√£o (56 species). Overall the site had good diversity of flora. Activities The park is used for research and for environmental education for school children. The park has ecological trails, a belvedere and a visitor center. The park works with the Military Environmental Police on the Florestinha Project, where children and adolescents attend after-school classes and activities that teach them about conservation and citizenship. The program is popular with students, who help with environmental awareness programs in the neighborhood.

An experimental psychologist and cognitive scientist, Pashler is best known for his studies of human attentional limitations (his analysis of the Psychological refractory period effect concluded that the brain has discrete \\"processing bottlenecks\\" associated with specific types of cognitive operations). and for his work on visual attention He has also developed and tested new methods for enhancing learning and reducing forgetting, focusing on the temporal spacing of learning and retrieval practice. Pashler is also known for influential critiques of methodological and statistical practices in behavioral science. His critiques have focused on statistical and logical issues in neuroimaging research (\\"voodoo correlations\\"), educational psychology (learning styles concept) testing of mathematical models, and the replicability of ‚Äúbehavioral priming‚Äù research in the field of social psychology. Education Pashler was born in 1958 in New York. He received his BA in Logic and Philosophy of Science from Brown University in 1980 and his PhD in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1985. He joined the faculty of the University of California, San Diego in 1985. Honors Pashler was elected to membership in the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 2000. He is also an elected Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the Psychonomic Society. Pashler received the Troland Research Awards from the National Academy of Sciences in 1999; the Academy cited his \\"many experimental breakthroughs in the study of spatial attention and executive control, and... his insightful analysis of human cognitive architecture.\\" He also received the Chancellor‚Äôs Associates Award for Research given by University of California, San Diego. Research career In the 1980s, Pashler and several colleagues developed the Response Selection Bottleneck model of dual-task interference. The model, partly inspired by early work by Alan Welford, makes many predictions about patterns of behavioral response times in the Psychological Refractory Period experiment. The model has been supported by mathematical analyses of behavioral response times and studies of brain activity when people engage in multitasking. In 1988, Pashler published the first demonstration of the perceptual phenomenon that later came to be called change blindness, using displays of letters that appeared, disappeared, and reappeared (sometimes with alterations). He noted the contrast between observers' subjective sense of awareness of an entire display and their very limited ability to detect even large changes. In 1992, Pashler (with Mark Carrier) showed that the testing effect (sometimes referred to as Retrieval Practice) directly strengthens associative learning, and does so more effectively than the same time spent re-studying the same associative links. In 2007, Liqiang Huang and Pashler proposed the Boolean Map Theory of visual attention and awareness. The theory argues that a specific type of abstract data structure (the Boolean Map) characterizes the contents of human visual awareness at any given instant in time. In 2008 (with Melody Wiseheart & other collaborators) Pashler carried out the most systematic and long-term studies of the effect of temporal spacing on human learning. Holding total time constant, the team found that when people study information on two occasions separated by a temporal gap G, and then are given a memory test after a further delay D, performance on the test is best when the G is about 10-20% as long as D. (This implies, for example, that if one wishes to study information on two occasions with the goal of retaining it for 1 year, the best practice would be to separate the two study events by about 1 month, whereas if one wished to retain the information for a week, a 1-day gap would work better.) This research is relied upon by some software developers in building spaced-learning apps and websites to help people to retain information more efficiently In 2006, US Department of Education commissioned Pashler to lead a review of cognitive science findings that could best help guide teachers in scientifically validated instructional practices. The resulting Practice Guide is distributed by the Department and is available free of charge on the department's website. In 2008 (with Edward Vul) Pashler showed that the famous Wisdom of Crowds Effect first noted by Francis Galton could be elicited within a single individual. Averaging two estimates from the same person (their first-choice answer and a second answer elicited later) produced an improvement in accuracy equal to about 1/3 the benefit obtained by averaging estimates from two different people. This discovery, termed the ‚ÄúInner Crowd Effect‚Äù by The Economist helped prompt follow-up research examining potential new methods of improving human judgment accuracy. Pashler has also published several articles on varied topics in political psychology, including biases in perception of newsworthiness and attitudes to pro-liberty views.Pashler, Hal: ‚ÄúU.S. Immigrants‚Äô Attitudes Toward Libertarian Values‚Äù (2013). Department of Psychology, University of California, San Diego. Controversies In 2008, Pashler (along with Vul, Harris, and Winkielman) published a paper initially entitled ‚ÄúVoodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience‚Äù arguing that many of the most prominent research articles in cognitive and social neuroscience had made statistical errors resulting in gross over-estimation of brain-behavior correlation values. The paper (published under the milder title \\"Puzzlingly Large Correlations...\\") produced an intense controversy that was covered in popular media as well as academic press. Some writers have pointed to this paper as having helped launch the current period of intensive methodological debate and controversy in behavioral science Statistical practices in brain imaging field appear to have changed in response to the paper with increased use of cross-validation. In 2009, Pashler chaired a review commissioned by the American Psychological Society examining the validity of the concept of learning styles The review concluded that widely accepted ideas about learning styles lacked serious empirical support and recommended that educators should not base instructional practices on these notions. These conclusions have prompted extensive controversy in the education field Pashler has also been an outspoken proponent of efforts to increase replicability in psychological research, arguing that many very well-known findings in areas like social cognition and social psychology should not be believed due to statistical errors, publication bias, and other problems. Together with E. J. Wagenmakers, he edited the special issue of the Perspectives on Psychological Science which appears to have introduced the term ‚ÄòReplicability Crisis‚Äô in reference to the current state of social and behavioral science.

It is a small, diffuse shrub with its branches, leaves and some of its flower parts densely covered with white, woolly hairs. The flowers are a shade of red and tube-shaped with the stamens and style extending beyond the end of the five petals. Description Dasymalla axillaris is a diffuse shrub which grows to a height of about and which has its branches, leaves and sepals densely covered with white branched hairs. The leaves are stalkless, egg- shaped with the narrow end towards the base, long, wide and are wrinkled below their woolly covering. The flowers are vivid in appearance, deep red to yellowish scarlet and are arranged singly or in groups of up to five in leaf axils on woolly stalks long. Each flower is surrounded by woolly bracts and bracteoles. The sepals are woolly-hairy on the outside, glabrous on the inside, long, forming a short tube near their base. The five petals form a broad tube long with five roughly circular lobes with a wavy to tooth-like end, the lower lobe slightly larger than the others. The tube is sparsely hairy on the outside and mostly glabrous on the inside, except for a ring of hairs near the ovary. The stamens are longer than the flower tube and the style is longer than the stamens. Flowering occurs from July to December and is followed by an egg-shaped fruit with two humps on the end and the sepals attached to it. Taxonomy and naming Dasymalla axillaris was first formally described in 1839 by Stephan Endlicher and the description was published in his book Novarum Stirpium Decades. In 1917, George Druce transferred the species to Pityrodia but in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber resurrected the genus Dasymalla, including this species. The specific epithet (axillaris) is a Latin word meaning \\"of an axil\\". Distribution and habitat This species of Dasymalla grows in deep sand in recently disturbed areas about south-east of Geraldton in the Avon Wheatbelt, Swan Coastal Plain and Yalgoo biogeographic region and its numbers decline fairly rapidly following the disturbance. Conservation Dasymalla axillaris is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia) meaning that it is likely to become extinct or is rare, or otherwise in need of special protection.

The British Royal Navy captured her early in 1781. She first appeared in a commercial role in 1784 as America, and was renamed in 1785 as Butterworth. She served primarily as a whaler in the Greenland whale fisheries. New owners purchased her in 1789. She underwent a great repair in 1791 that increased her size by almost 20%. She is most famous for her role in the \\"Butterworth Squadron\\", which took her and two ship's tenders on an exploration, sealing, otter fur, and whaling voyage to Alaska and the Pacific Coast of North America. She and her consorts are widely credited with being the first European vessels to enter, in 1794, what is now Honolulu harbour. After her return to England in 1795, Butterworth went on three more whaling voyages to the South Pacific, then Africa, and then the South Pacific again. In 1802 she was outward bound on her fourth of these voyage, this to the South Pacific, when she was lost. French privateer Many accounts of the Butterworth Squadron refer to Butterworth as a former French 30-gun frigate. The tern \\"frigate\\" was often used loosely. Butterworths previous name was American, and there was no French warship of that name that fit her description. However, there was a French privateer frigate Am√©ricaine, of Granville, that carried 32 guns and that was active between 1779 and 1780. Between 1778 and 1779 Am√©ricaine was under the command of Captain Paul Eudes de la Cocardi√®re. Under his command she captured at least four prizes: Hunter, Sorel, Edgipezeriere, and Good Intent. He paid Am√©ricaine off on 20 May 1779.Les Corsaires. Accessed 2 December 2016. Captain Fran√ßois Jourdan de la Monnerie was her next captain, in 1780. Under his command she captured the prizes Machora, Betsy, Sil Lah, Race Horse, Elisabeth Quenley, Notre Dame du Rosaire, and Hanto of Black. He paid her off on 3 July 1780. Am√©ricaine then made a third cruise. On 17 January 1781 Am√©ricaine recaptured the Dutch ship Hendrick Frederick, Captain Raba, master.

It is one of ten mathematical books known collectively as Suanjing shishu (The Ten Computational Canons). In 656 CE, when mathematics was included in the imperial examinations, these ten outstanding works were selected as textbooks. Jiuzhang suanshu (The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art) and Sunzi Suanjing (The Mathematical Classic of Sunzi) are two of these texts that precede Zhang Qiujian suanjing. All three works share a large number of common topics. In Zhang Qiujian suanjing one can find the continuation of the development of mathematics from the earlier two classics. Internal evidences suggest that book was compiled sometime between 466 and 485 CE. \\"Zhang Qiujian suanjing has an important place in the world history of mathematics: it is one of those rare books before AD 500 that manifests the upward development of mathematics fundamentally due to the notations of the numeral system and the common fraction. The numeral system has a place value notation with ten as base, and the concise notation of the common fraction is the one we still use today.\\" Almost nothing is known about the author Zhang Qiujian, sometimes written as Chang Ch'iu-Chin or Chang Ch'iu-chien. It is estimated that he lived from 430 to 490 CE, but there is no consensus. Contents In its surviving form, the book has a preface and three chapters. There are two missing bits, one at the end of Chapter 1 and one at the beginning of Chapter 3. Chapter 1 consists of 32 problems, Chapter 2 of 22 problems and Chapter 3 of 38 problems. In the preface, the author has set forth his objectives in writing the book clearly. There are three objectives: The first is to explain how to handle arithmetical operations involving fractions; the second objective is to put forth new improved methods for solving old problems; and, the third objective is to present computational methods in a precise and comprehensible form. Here is a typical problem of Chapter 1: \\"Divide 6587 2/3 and 3/4 by 58 ƒ±/2. How much is it?\\" The answer is given as 112 437/702 with a detailed description of the process by which the answer is obtained. This description makes use of the Chinese rod numerals. The chapter considers several real world problems where computations with fractions appear naturally. In Chapter 2, among others, there are a few problem requiring application of the rule of three. Here is a typical problem: \\"Now there was a person who stole a horse and rode off with it. After he has traveled 73 li, the owner realized [the theft] and gave chase for 145 li when [the thief] was 23 li ahead before turning back. If he had not turned back but continued to chase, find the distance in li before he reached [the thief].\\" Answer is given as 238 3/14 li. In Chapter 3, there are several problems connected with volumes of solids which are granaries. Here is an example: \\"Now there is a pit [in the shape of the frustum of a pyramid] with a rectangular base. The width of the upper [rectangle] is 4 chi and the width of the lower [rectangle] is 7 chi. The length of the upper [rectangle] is 5 chi and the length of the lower [rectangle] is 8 chi. The depth is 1 zhang. Find the amount of millet that it can hold.\\" However, the answer is given in a different set of units. The 37th problem is the \\"Washing Bowls Problem\\": \\"Now there was a woman washing cups by the river. An officer asked, \\"Why are there so many cups?\\" The woman replied, \\"There were guests in the house, but I do not know how many there were. However, every 2 persons had [a cup of] thick sauce, every 3 persons had [a cup of] soup and every 4 persons had [a cup of] rice; 65 cups were used altogether.\\" Find the number of persons.\\" The answer is given as 60 persons. The last problem in the book is the famous Hundred Fowls Problem which is often considered as one of the earliest examples involving equations with indeterminate solutions. \\"Now one cock is worth 5 qian, one hen 3 qian and 3 chicks 1 qian. It is required to buy 100 fowls with 100 qian. In each case, find the number of cocks, hens and chicks bought.\\" English translation Ang Tian Se, a student of University of Malaya, prepared an English translation of Zhang Qiujian Suanjing as part of the MA Dissertation. But the translation has not been published.

She is the granddaughter of critically acclaimed Chinese actor and director, Yuanlong Wang famous for his work in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. Throughout the course of her career, Wu has notably worked for the ABC daytime drama series General Hospital and One Life to Live while also working as a fellow writer for Disney. She has scripted and directed many documentary films that have screened at the IFP Market, Asian American International Film Festival, Sundance Producers Conference, and the Anthology Film Archives in New York City. As a writer she has also had her own plays read at prestigious outings and settings such as the Santa Clara Experimental Theater Festival and La Jolla Studio Stage. Proving herself to be rather multi talented, Wu has also served as a National Endowment for the Arts Panelist, New York State Council on the Arts, Individual Artist Grant Panelist and has served as an international Emmy Awards Juror, as well.  Early life  Jade Wu was born January 5, 1953, in Tokyo, Japan and was born into a family of Chinese heritage. She was the daughter of a soldier and spent much of her childhood traveling while her father was serving in the United States Army. Her family later settled in the United States where her father began work at Capitol Hill. Wu spent much of her childhood living in Washington, D.C. and considers it to be where she was raised, despite the many places she had lived before hand. Many years later she moved to California.  Education  After moving to the west coast, Wu attended the University of California, San Diego. Working towards success in medical school, Wu began research after her first year enrolled as a student, realizing that she wanted to pursue an MFA in theater. There, over time she developed the accents of standard English, British/Polish/ Slovakian and some fluency in Cantonese and Mandarin. Wu Graduated the University of California with a BS in Biochemistry, a BA in Humanities, a BA in Drama, and an MFA in Acting and Directing. Also, later received education: * Certification in Video/Film Editing from The Edit Center * AA in Science and Humanities from Mira Costa College  Before entertainment  After graduating, Jade Wu moved to New York City to put her degree to use and pursue her dream as an actress and or director. Upon her arrival, however, she could not find a job. There were no roles or positions for Asian Americans on television at the time, and if there were they were too small to benefit from financially. Because of the lack of opportunities, Wu got involved in commercialism and later found herself in the corporate realm of public relations and advertising. Through this period of her youth, she became skilled in image and visibility in both public and private sector campaigns. She became well-versed in international diplomacy and formalizing relationships as well as gaining interest in social, cultural, human, and environmental causes.

It was not until one of her old head-shots happened to end up in a Homicide: Life on the Street episodic casting office that she finally surfaced within Hollywood. At the time, the show was shooting in Baltimore, Maryland. The executives called her in for an audition as they were looking for a Korean immigrant. Even during the late 1990s roles for Asian American actors were so sparse that it was rare to find trained Asians who were adequately eligible for the position posted. Wu was awarded a recurring role on the show, officially introducing her to the professional arena of television. Jade Wu has since then, worked with many famous names, such as; Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, George C. Wolf, Austin Pendleton, Jeanine Tesori, Jenifer Lewis, Ato Essandoh, Fred Weller, Geoff Arends, Tony Kushner, Ridley Scott, Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Tony Gilroy, Warren Leight, Paul McGuigan, Guerrmo Navarro, Vincenzo Natali, Peter Leto, Clark Johnson, Frank Prinzi, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson. Wu also had recurring roles on One Life to Live, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Bull, The Blacklist. has performed on stage as well, working in Off-Broadway theatre productions at The Public, Delacorte Theatre in Central Park, Urban Stages, Bank St. Theatre, Minetta Lane, The Wilma Theatre, Arena Stage, Shakespeare Theatre Washington DC, and La Jolla Stage. Most notably, Wu played the lead role of Ahma Chin in a Sundance Sundance pedigree independent film, The Motel, which won the Humanitas Prize and an Independent Spirit Award Nomination. She has worked with iconic stage directors, such as Alan Schneider, Liv Ciuilei, JoAnne Akalaitis, Gerald Gutierrez, Wendy Goldberg, Blanka Zizkaand David Muse and numerous award-winning playwrights.

For a quarter of a century, she was a curator at the Frankfurt Ethnological Museum (now the Museum of World Cultures), and she also worked at the Frobenius Institute. Early life and education Karin Hissink was born in Berlin to Hertha Hissink, who came from a wealthy German family. Her father, Jack Hissink, was Dutch and worked for AEG. She had a brother, Jan. In her youth, she was a member of a women's group of glider pilots. She lost her entire family during World War II. She studied archaeology and ethnology at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland), and at the Frederick William University in Berlin. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the use of masks as facade decorations on ancient buildings of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. She obtained her doctorate in 1933 from Frederick William University and then worked for a year as a volunteer at an Ethnological Research Institute that was affiliated with the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Career In 1934, Hissink moved to Frankfurt, where she took positions at the Institute for Cultural Morphology (renamed the Frobenius Institute in 1938) and the Ethnological Museum (now the Museum of World Cultures). Over the next two years, she took part in the last of the twelve research expeditions to Africa led by German archaeologist Leo Frobenius that collected ethnographic data and objects and documented rock art. During World War II, Hissink effectively ran the Frobenius Institute as many of its male staff members were away on military service, and she was the wartime director of the Ethnological Museum (1940‚Äì1945). The institute was destroyed by bombing, but most of its holdings were saved, and for a time it was housed in Hissink's own apartment. After the war, from 1947 to 1972, Hissink was a curator at the Ethnological Museum. In the early 1950s, she spent two years doing field research in the then little-studied eastern lowlands of Bolivia, and this work is considered an important contribution to cultural anthropology. She focused on the mythology of the Chama, Chimane, and Tacana peoples . Her compilation of nearly 400 Tacana myths is the largest collection of myths that has been published about any South American ethnic group. She also brought back some 300 objects from these trips that are still in the collection of the World Cultures Museum. She did further research in the central American countries of Mexico, Honduras, and Costa Rica. She died in 1981 in Kronberg im Taunus, a town near Frankfurt.

Prasterone enanthate is a synthetic androgen, estrogen, and neurosteroid. It is a steroid ester and a long-lasting prodrug of prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone; DHEA) in the body. Prasterone is a naturally occurring prohormone of androgens and estrogens and hence is an agonist of the androgen and estrogen receptors, the respective biological targets of androgens like testosterone and estrogens like estradiol. Prasterone also has a variety of activities of its own, including neurosteroid and other activities. An injection of prasterone enanthate has a duration of action in terms of elevated prasterone levels of about 18 days. The combination of estradiol valerate and prasterone enanthate was developed as early as 1966 and was introduced for medical use in 1975. The formulation is marketed widely throughout Europe, and is also available in several Latin American countries and in Egypt. It is not available in any predominantly English-speaking countries. Medical uses The combination of estradiol valerate and prasterone enanthate is used in menopausal hormone therapy to treat menopausal symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women. Estradiol valerate serves as an estrogen in the preparation, while prasterone enanthate is intended to serve as a weak androgen. It is thought that the inclusion of prasterone enanthate in the formulation may provide additional psychotropic benefits. =Available forms= Prasterone enanthate is available only as a combination formulation of 4 mg estradiol valerate and 200 mg prasterone enanthate in oil for depot intramuscular injection. Side effects Prasterone enanthate, in combination with estradiol valerate at the dosages used clinically, has no masculinizing side effects. This is in contrast to combinations of estrogens with other androgens, such as testosterone esters. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= =Pharmacokinetics= Estradiol and levels after a single intramuscular injection of Gynodian Depot (4 mg estradiol valerate, 200 mg prasterone enanthate in oil) in women. The pharmacokinetics of prasterone enanthate have been assessed in a number of studies. Prasterone enanthate is a prodrug of prasterone in the body. It is completely hydrolyzed into prasterone and heptanoic acid (enanthic acid) following absorption from the tissue depot after intramuscular injection. Levels of DHEA peak at about 9 ng/mL within 1 to 4 days of an injection of prasterone enanthate. Subsequently, DHEA levels return to baseline by about 18 days following the injection. Prasterone enanthate has an elimination half-life of about 9 days. The plasma half-life of DHEA/prasterone enanthate following an intravenous injection is about 44 minutes. The half-lives of DHEA metabolites range up to 3.6 days. Within 30 days, 91% of a dose of prasterone enanthate is eliminated. Approximately 94% is excreted in urine and 6% in feces. Prasterone enanthate is eliminated mainly in the form of metabolites and conjugates. Chemistry Prasterone enanthate, also known as 5-dehydroepiandrosterone 3Œ≤-enanthate or as androst-5-en-3Œ≤-ol-17-one 3Œ≤-heptanoate, is a synthetic androstane steroid and the C3Œ≤ heptanoate (enanthate) ester of prasterone (5-dehydroepiandrosterone). History Prasterone enanthate was patented by Schering in 1968 and 1971. The combination of estradiol valerate and prasterone enanthate was developed and marketed by Schering, was first tested clinically as early as 1966, was first described in the scientific literature in 1972, and was first introduced for medical use in April 1975. Society and culture =Brand names= The major brand name of the combination of estradiol valerate and prasterone enanthate is Gynodian Depot. Other brand names of this formulation include Binodian Depot, Cidodian Depot, Klimax, and Supligol NF. =Availability= The combination of estradiol valerate and prasterone enanthate is marketed widely throughout Europe, and is also available in several Latin American countries and in Egypt.https://www.micromedexsolutions.com/ In Europe, it is available in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, and Switzerland. In Latin America, it is available in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela.

Call. It was directed by Yves Simoneau. It is a two-part adaptation of the 1995 novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry and is chronologically the third book of the Lonesome Dove series, but regarded as the first events in the Lonesome Dove franchise. In this prequel to Lonesome Dove, it is 1840s Texas, and two young men join the Texas Rangers unit that's on a mission to annex Santa Fe. While the miniseries has been broken up into 3 parts for the DVD release, the series was originally broadcast by ABC over two nights in May 1996, and was later nominated for several awards. Plot =Part 1= The series begins in the Republic of Texas in 1842, as Comanche warriors led by Buffalo Hump use the full moon to conduct slave-raids on settlements in northern Mexico. Woodrow Call and Augustus \\"Gus\\" McCrae are junior Texas Rangers of a larger party heading west to scout a road from San Antonio to El Paso. Tasked with night watching the camp, a drunk McCrae wanders off exploring and is chased and wounded by Buffalo Hump. The next morning, the group is ambushed and two of the party are killed and one wounded. Three months later in Austin, a large group is being assembled in order to seize Santa Fe from the Mexicans as the Texan Santa Fe Expedition. McCrae encounters Clara Forsythe at the local store and Call meets Maggie at the local whorehouse. News of a Comanche raid takes the Rangers group west over the Brazos River, where they are ambushed while resting. Call manages the only kill of the punishment squad's raid and is promoted to corporal as a result, whereas McCrae proposes to Clara. Rejoining the expedition, they encounter Buffalo Hump again and learn (after inviting him to parley at their camp) that it was his son who died at the hands of Call. =Part 2= The expedition begins to break up as it is slowed by heavy rains and many of the civilians opt to return to Austin. The increasingly rocky terrain of Comancheria also proves troublesome for the wagons. After meeting the ranger Charlie Goodnight, who explains that they're heading into country with no water, their native guides desert, stealing horses as they go. They again encounter the natives who harry them by shooting Call, stealing more horses and setting fire to the grasslands. Now on foot, with no horses and limited supplies, the party splits over gathering food and which way to travel to find water. McCrae, weakened by hunger and thirst, is haunted by a dream of Buffalo Hump riding a buffalo. Wallace, Call, and McCrae are arrested by Mexican militia after stumbling into a remote Mexican village. En route to San Lazaro to be tried, the camp is attacked at night by a grizzly, allowing them to escape with rifles. In the darkness they re-find their companions, and the morning reveals a large Mexican army camp nearby. Now around 30, weakened by hunger, and with limited ammunition, Colonel Cobb enters the camp and surrenders to the Mexicans - but not without resistance from Call who attacks Cobb and receives 100 lashes as punishment. The army breaks camp and moves with their prisoners through Apache lands. As they travel, the nights become increasingly cold, increasing the suffering of the travellers. They soon find the corpses of the Mexican general and his retinue, killed by the region's rogue natives, led by an Apache named Gomez - including Cobb who survived blinded and crippled. Many of the group are unfit for the \\"dead man's walk\\" through the wastelands and across \\"the big dry\\", more so after Cobb decides to die in a blaze of glory, killing Shadrach and injuring several others in the process. Finally they begin the desert crossing. =Part 3= Continuing to cross the desert, their horses are soon stolen by the Apache. Their numbers dwindle as they are picked off one by one, until they finally reach the Rio Grande having survived the Jornada del Muerto. Here the prisoners are transferred to a French Major in charge of a troop of lancers, and the disgraced Mexican Captain is told to return across the desert to his post despite the dangers. Told to bathe in a river, the prisoners panic when the army begins a practice military maneuver, and several more are killed by accident. They soon arrive at San Lazaro, a leper colony, and the seven surviving men are forced to select lots to decide who among them will be executed for treason. Bigfoot Wallace is among those executed. Also in the colony is an English prisoner, The Lady Carrie, who along with her son Willie, and Lady-in-Waiting Emerald, having been ransomed and released, asks to travel back to Austin with them and offers to provision the journey. On the way back they again travel back through Comancheria but are able to spook the Comanche with an aria, a snake, and a sword. Back in Austin, McCrae calls again on Clara, and Call turns to see Maggie leave the store. Clara and McCrae kiss while Call looks on awkwardly. Call looks out the window to see Maggie and the two share a meaningful look with each other. Cast =Main cast= Production The series teleplay was co-written by author Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, who had also worked on other parts of the Lonesome Dove series, and later went on to write the screenplay for Brokeback Mountain.

The Hoshin Kanri strategic planning system originated from post-war Japan, but has since spread to the U.S. and around the world. Translated from Japanese, Hoshin Kanri aptly means \\"compass management\\". The individual words \\"hoshin\\" and \\"kanri\\" mean direction and administration, respectively.  Overview  Hoshin Kanri requires a strategic vision in order to succeed. From there, strategic objectives need to be clearly defined, with goals being written for long periods of a one to five- year-long timeframe. Once the long term timeframe goals are completed, the team can focus on yearly objectives. Management needs to avoid picking too many vital goals in order to stay focused on what is strategically important. The big goals then need to be broken down into smaller goals, at a weekly and monthly basis and then implemented so that everyone, from management to the factory floor, is in agreement on what needs to be accomplished. The satisfaction of goals should be reviewed on a monthly basis, with a larger annual review at the end of the year. Performance measurement is also a key part of the process. Hoshin Kanri is a top-down approach, with the goals being mandated by management and the implementation being performed by employees. As a result, systems need to be in place to ensure that objectives from senior management are effectively communicated all the way down the chain of command. As such, a catchball system is often used in order to aid in the execution of the strategic plan. A catchball system seeks to get opinions of both managers and employees through meetings and interactions in order to ensure the bidirectional flow of goals, feedback, and other information throughout the organization.  Usage  Companies that use Hoshin Kanri often follow a Think, Plan, Implement, and Review process, which is comparable to W. Edwards Deming's Plan Do Check Act cycle. This is because Deming played a role in the spreading of quality control principles that influenced the development of Hoshin Kanri. The cyclical process is a way to plan for the future, not just to react to what is happening now. The principles of PDCA are heavily embedded into the Hoshin Kanri planning process. Beyond PDCA, Joseph M. Juran also played a role in spreading quality control principles that influenced Hoshin Kanri, specifically focusing on management's role in the process.

After education at King's College School, Watson studied under Arthur William Rucker and C. V. Boys at the Royal College of Science and received his bachelor's degree in 1890. At the Royal College of Science, Watson was appointed demonstrator in physics in 1890, assistant professor in 1897, and professor in 1915. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1901. At the beginning of his career, Watson was an assistant to Professors A. W. Rucker and Thomas Edward Thorpe in the great magnetic survey of the British Isles from 1890 to 1895. He assisted C. V. Boys in radio-micrometer experiments, in timing the periodicity of spark generators' electrical discharges, and in photographing the flight of bullets. He worked with J. W. Rodger in investigating the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarisation in liquids. He designed and built self-recording magnetographs which were used at Kew, Eskadalemuir, and other observatories. His textbooks of physics, Textbook of Physics, Intermediate Physics, and Practical Physics, became popular and were widely used. As a member of the Expert and Technical Committee of the Royal Automobile Club, Watson created specially designed instruments to investigate and develop the petrol motor. He assisted W. de W. Abney in experiments on colour vision. Upon the poison gas attacks in April 1915, Watson was sent to France to experiment with defensive countermeasures and in May 1915 made the first Allied experiments on a gas- cloud in the field. In June 1915, the British Army established the Central Laboratory with Watson as director. He was personally involved in the systematic collection and examination of the German shells and fuses used for the gas attacks. During these field investigations he was frequently gassed with a variety of poisons. In the last great gas attack of the war, Watson was a victim and eventually succumbed in hospital. In addition to the Royal Automobile Club, Watson was a member of the Savile Club.

He would popularize this term in Latin American evangelicalism through the Latin American Theological Fellowship and through global evangelicalism through the Lausanne Conference of 1974.  Life  Padilla was born into a poor family in Quito, Ecuador, in 1932. Due to the Great Depression, his family would move when he was two years old to Colombia, where he would grow up. He would later pursue a BA in philosophy and a MA in theology at Wheaton College, before continuing on to complete a PhD in the New Testament from the University of Manchester, under F. F. Bruce. His education and experiences with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship underscored Padilla's evangelical foundations and the priority he would place on the historical-critical approach to hermeneutics. However, in 1959, Padilla was appointed a traveling secretary in Latin America for International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. In his work with universities throughout Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, Padilla would be faced with a tense sociopolitical context. Students were immersed in Marxist writings and grappled with the possibility of revolution. This would be the context which produced not only Catholic liberation theology, but also challenged Padilla to develop a new evangelical social theology which he would later term \\"integral mission.\\" Padilla would bring his ideas to the global stage at the Lausanne Conference of 1974. This would have a significant effect on the nature of global evangelicalism and the growing priority of evangelicals in both evangelicalism and social activism.

It's a loose housing system, similar to free-stall housing, except there are no stalls or partitions. In a CBP, the resting and exercise areas of the cows are combined, resulting in reduced ammonia emissions, lower building costs, and increased cow movement. For these systems to be successful, they must be managed very closely. They requires tilling with a roto-tiller or deep-tillage tool to incorporate the manure, urine, and air into the pack and allow it to dry. The composting process allows the manure and urine to be stored for months at a time, while also supplying a bedding and exercise area for cows. Compost bedded pack barns are a fairly new system for housing dairy cattle, and are appealing to producers due to the lower instances of lameness and hock lesions. They also improve cow comfort, as the cows are not restricted in their lying behavior from stall size and partitions that are typically found in free-stall housing systems. Compost bedded pack barns are typically bedded with wood shavings/sawdust, or other organic materials that are compostable. For the composting process to work in a CBP, the internal temperature of the pack must be maintained at approximately 43.3-65.0 degrees Celsius and have a moisture content at approximately 40-60%. The lower end of the temperature range is compatible with cellulose degradation, which is needed to break down the wood shavings/sawdust that is typically used. The higher end of the temperature range is compatible with pathogen destruction, which helps destroy mastitis causing bacteria The first CBP was built in 2001 in Minnesota. However, the compost bedded pack system was invented by dairy farmers in Virginia to improve upon the conventional bedded pack system. The recommended stocking density of a CBP is 7.4 m2/cow (80 sq. feet/cow) for the average Holstein cow. This allows for the proper aeration and absorption of manure and urine by the bedding and still allow the composting process to work.

Pelehin went abroad, attended internships at universities and hospitals in Lemberg, Cracow, Vienna and listened to lectures on pharmacology, toxicology, hygiene and therapy. From Vienna he went to the University of Berlin, then in Breslau and Paris. In the summer of 1829 he visited the universities of Holland, then again, he attended lectures in Paris. During this time Pelehin was elected a member of many foreign medical societies: correspondent for the Medical Surgical Society in Berlin, correspondent for the Russian Society Braslav improvements (1829) and a member of the Medical and Surgical Society in London (1830) among others. In 1829, Pelehin returned to Russia and was appointed the position of associate professor of ophthamology and founded a small eye clinic. In the same year he passed doctoral exams and received from the Medical-Surgical Academy the title of doctor of medicine without the dissertation, \\"honoris causa\\". In August 1830, after reading the lecture \\"de amaurosibus\\" (in Latin) and another trial lecture \\"about artificial pupil\\" (in Russian), he was confirmed in the rank of associate professor, but was forced to leave the Academy for several years. In connection with the cholera epidemic Pelehin was appointed as a member of the commission for the study and stop this epidemic, sent to Saratov, then in Astrakhan, where he stayed for three years. In 1831, he contracted severe form of cholera, from which almost died. In 1834, Pelehin was sent to London for a year to study lithoclasty (Lithotripsy) by the method Gertlu and other issues. After returning home he became a professor of forensic medicine, medical care and police, he was ordered to take the chair. In 1839 he was awarded the degree of Doctor in Surgery. In 1840-1841 he lectured in ophthalmology. In the same year he was confirmed in the rank of Distinguished Professor, and in 1846 he retired with the rank of state councillor.

Biography In 1831, her great grandfather and grandfather, both known as James Stewart, immigrated to Canada from Scotland. The Stewarts established themselves in Straftford, Ontario. Grace Anne Stewart's father, James Stewart, was the only one of his six brothers to become a farmer. In 1881, he moved to Manitoba and settled on a farm near Minnedosa where Grace Anne Stewart was then born and raised. Grace had two brothers and two sisters. Despite being raised in a rural environment, Grace Anne was not lacking professional influences. Three of her uncles received medical degrees from the University of Chicago, while another was a lawyer, and her fifth uncle was a building contractor. In 1918 Stewart earned her Bachelor of Arts majoring in geology at the University of Alberta. She was the first woman attain this academic achievement in Canada. Her Freshman and Sophomore year she was a member of the Alberta College Literary Society. In 1918, she was also the captain of the girls hockey team, which was said to be an exceptional year in the history of the team. Upon earning her degree she remained at the University of Alberta as Assistant in the Department of Geology from 1918‚Äì1920, and in 1920, she earned a Masters in Arts. She was then awarded a fellowship at the University of Chicago. Here she worked under the supervision of Stuart Weller and earned a Ph.D. with distinction in 1922. She began her professional career in 1923 when she accepted an offer to become an Instructor at Ohio State University. She attained the title of professor in 1946 and remained at Ohio State University until her retirement in 1954. Here she was active in Faculty Women's Group and was Chairman for one year. She also dedicated much of her time to the Geological Museum. Following her dissertation, Stewart focused primarily on Paleozoic faunas of Ohio and in 1937, was the Chairman of the Geology Section of the Ohio Academy of Science. Stewart was also listed as a Member of Sigma Xi, Fellow Paleontological Society, Fellow Geological Society of America, and was listed in Who's Who - Women of America. Stewart was highly active in her academic career. In the summers of 1919 and 1920 she worked for the Research Council of Alberta. The summers of 1921 and 1922 she spent working in the National Museum with the Geology Survey of Canada. It is noteworthy to mention that her collaboration with Dr. J.A. Allan at the University of Alberta lead to long-term exchanges of rock samples and fossils that aided the development of both institutions geological museums in 1924 to 1925. During World War II, she worked at the Office of Strategic Services in Washington from October 1944 to October 1945 as a geographer. In 1954, Stewart retired and moved to Tucson, Arizona. However, this was not the end of her career. Stewart took a job offer in Calgary assigned with the task of correlating fossils found in oil well cores from different geographical areas. She returned to her retirement in Arizona after a short time in Calgary. In 1969 she suffered a stroke and was placed in a nursing home. She died in 1970 at the age of 77 having spent the last 16 years of her life in Tucson, Arizona. One of Stewart's most notable works was for McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology where she wrote an article on the Devonian period in the geology section. Of her personality, it is said that she gave her best effort whether in the office, laboratory, or a classroom. Stewart assumed roles in science that were almost exclusively reserved for men. She is said to be hospitable, gracious and dignified and well-liked by all.

She was elected AAAS fellow in 2013 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 2015.  Early life and education  Wu's parents were physics professors in Beijing, China. In high school, Wu was recognized as an academic talent and frequently chosen for competitions in math and physics. Her parents made diligent efforts to provide her with a rigorous education, even during the anti-intellectualism of the \\"Cultural Revolution.\\" As a high school junior, Wu was selected to the Chinese preparatory camp for the International Mathematical Olympiad, but declined in order to attend a summer program in biology. Wu was admitted from high school to Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) with the highest entering grades in 1982. She received the first 3-year pre-medical education in this program at Peking University and then attended PUMC for clinical education. While at PUMC, she participated in laboratory research in immunology and became deeply fascinated by basic research. In 1987, Wu attended a scientific lecture on virus structure by Professor Michael Rossmann, a pioneer in X-ray crystallography who was visiting Beijing at the time. Instead of spending another two years to complete her M.D. degree, Wu resolved to come to the U.S. to pursue further scientific training. She entered the Ph.D. program in biochemistry at Purdue University in Indiana in 1988 under Professor Rossmann's supervision, graduating in 1992, and then moved to New York City to perform her postdoctoral work in Professor Wayne Hendrickson's laboratory at Columbia University.  Career  Following her postdoctoral work, Wu started an independent laboratory as assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Weill Cornell Medical College in 1997. She was promoted to associate professor in 2001 before becoming professor in 2003. In 2012, she was recruited to the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital as the Asa and Patricia Springer Professor of Structural Biology in the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School.  Research  Wu's research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in cell death and inflammation, mainly through the application of biochemical and biophysical methods. Her laboratory has determined the structures of numerous large protein complexes that play critically important roles in immune signaling, including structures of TRAFs, Myddosome and IKK-beta in Toll-like receptor signaling, the Inflammasome, and the synaptic recombination-activating gene (RAG) complexes. Based on these studies, she has advanced the concept of signal transduction as a process that is mediated by higher-order oligomer assembly, with ramifications that include proximity-driven enzyme activation, threshold behavior, signal amplification, reduction of biological noise, and temporal and spatial control of signal transduction.

Copenhagen's new neighbourhoods outside the old fortifications were experiencing rapid population growth while the population in the old city was declining. Some of the oldest and most ramshack housing blocks were therefore being replaced by commercial buildings or modern apartment buildings. The new street ran diagonally through the area. It was named after Christian IX who had just died. Construction progressed fast and had been completed in 1910. Buildings Eugen J√∏rgensen, who was both a partner in the development company and a member of the City Council, designed all the buildings along the street. They are built in a monumental National Romantic style, combining red brick and roof tiles with architectural details such as bay windows, orio windows, exposed timber framing, turrets and spires.

Born into a wealthy family as Peter Fox Andr√©, he became an atheist and married a working-class woman. As a result, he was disowned by his family. He first came to prominence as publisher of the National Reformer, a newspaper which campaigned for secularism. He subscribed to the Religion of Humanity of Auguste Comte, and was also a leading figure in the British National League for the Independence of Poland, and served on the executive of the Reform League.Timothy Messer-Kruse, The Yankee International: Marxism and the American Reform Tradition, 1848-1876, p.268Hal Draper, The Marx-Engels glossary, p.71 Fox was a founding member of the International Workingmen's Association (IWMA) in 1864, serving on its general council continuously, and acting as its press representative from 1865 onwards. Other than Karl Marx, he was the only regular member of the council who was a non-worker and considered an intellectual. In May 1866, Fox was made the IWMA's Corresponding Secretary to America. He threw himself into the task, writing to a large number of leaders of working-class movements in the country, and had particular success with William Jessup, vice president of the National Labor Union, who led his union into sympathy with the IWMA.Timothy Messer-Kruse, The Yankee International: Marxism and the American Reform Tradition, 1848-1876, pp.61-65 In September 1866, the IWMA's general secretary, W.

Fox was the only council member who could take over at short notice, and so he filled the post until November, when Cremer briefly returned.Hal Draper, Karl Marx‚Äôs Theory of Revolution, p.561 He continued as Corresponding Secretary, but increasingly came into conflict with Marx, believing that Marx had manoeuvred to remove some of his contacts from posts in the movement. Fox proposed that the headquarters of the IWMA be moved to Geneva, as he knew that Marx had less support there than in other centres of the movement, but the council rejected this plan. He resigned later in 1867, citing a need to work full-time as a journalist in order to support his family. Fox subsequently moved to Vienna, and soon afterwards began corresponding with Marx on a friendly basis. He died of a pulmonary disease in 1869, leaving his wife and children in poverty. Marx contacted Fox's mother, who agreed to assist Fox's wife and children after Marx threatened to start public collections.

Francisco came up with his own method of making ketchup using bananas in 1938. In 1942, he began commercial production of banana ketchup under the brand name Mafran, a portmanteau derived from the first syllables of his first name and surname. He registered Mafran as a trademark with the Bureau of Patents in the Philippines. Years later, Francisco approached Tirso T. Reyes for funding to expand his business. This led to the establishment of the Universal Foods Corporation in 1960. Francisco soon left the company due to internal conflicts. Francisco established Jufran Food Industries and launched Jufran Banana Catsup. The name Jufran was derived from Francisco's son and namesake, Magdalo \\"Jun\\" Francisco Jr. In 1969, Universal Foods Corporation launched UFC Tamis Anghang Banana Catsup, made from a unique recipe which combines the sweetness preferred by the Filipino palate with a spicy aftertaste, hence, tamis-anghang (Tagalog for sweet-spicy).

It was a scene of merriment to see him sporting a moustache because basically he was a Carnatic singer and in those days it was considered a taboo for them to wear a moustache. However, the very next moment shooting was over, Subramania Iyer got a clean shave done. R. Balasaraswathi who became a popular playback singer in later years, appeared as a child artiste, playing the role of Tukkaram's daughter. The film was produced also in Telugu with C. S. R. Anjaneyulu playing the title role. Soundtrack Although no print of the film has survived, making it a lost film, some song discs of the film were still available as of January 2008.

A member of the Naddula Chahamana family, he carved out a principality for himself with Jalore at its capital. He ruled parts of southern Rajasthan as a feudatory of the Chaulukyas, and participated in their successful battle against Muhammad of Ghor in 1178 CE. He also fought with other Chaulukya feudatories, including Asala of Kiratakupa (modern Kiradu) and the Guhila chief Samantasimha.  Early life  Kirtipala was the youngest of the three sons of the Naddula Chahamana king Alhana and queen Annalla-devi. Kirtipala's elder brother Kelhana became the king of Naddula, while Kirtipala himself became the governor of a fief of 12 villages. According to Kirtipala's 1161 CE Nadol copper-plate inscription, the 12 villages given to him by Alhana and prince Kelhana were: In the 1182 CE Jalor inscription of his son Samarasimha, he is styled as \\"Maharaja Kirtipala-deva\\".  Military career  Javalipura was originally ruled by the members of a Paramara branch. According to the 17th century chronicler Muhnot Nainsi, the pradhana (prime minister) of the local Paramara ruler was a Dahiya Rajput. Kitu (Kirtipala) managed to take control of Javalipura after winning over this Dahiya pradhana. Kirtipala's conquest of Javalipura appears to have happened during the reign of his father Alhana. He continued to govern this territory during the reign of his brother Kelhana. At least in the early part of his reign, he acknowledged the suzerainty of his brother. The Chaulukyas of Gujarat were the ultimate overlords of both Naddula and Jalore Chahamana branches. The Sundha Hill inscription boasts that Kirtipala routed the Turushka (Turkic) army at Kasahrada (modern Kyara in Sirohi district). This refers to an 1178 CE battle, in which the Chaulukya army defeated the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor. Kirtipala seems to have joined the Chaulukya forces in this battle, during the reign of Mularaja II. A Kumbhalgarh inscription suggests that Kirtipala invaded the Guhila kingdom, and ousted its ruler Samantasimha. Kirtipala probably launched this invasion during 1171-1179 CE, with the approval of his Chaulukya overlord. Later, Samantasimha's younger brother Kumarasimha gained his ancestral throne by appeasing the Chaulukya king, who was probably Mularaja II or his predecessor Ajayapala. Kirtipala seems to have given up his allegiance to the Chaulukyas as a result of this episode. According to the Sundha Hill inscription, Kirtipala defeated Asala, the ruler of Kiratakupa (modern Kiradu) and a vassal of the Chaulukyas. Earlier, in 1152 CE, Kirtipala's father Alhana had obtained control of Kiratakupa as a feudatory of the Chaulukya king Kumarapala. Sometime later, the Chaulukyas had transferred control of Kiratakupa to another Chahamana prince called Madanabrahma. Asala was probably the successor of Madanabrahma.  Personal life  Kirtipala had at least three sons and a daughter. The three sons were Samarasimha, Lakhanapala and Abhayapala. Samarasimha was his eldest son and successor. According to the 1176 Lalrai inscription, Lakhanapala and Abhayapala controlled Sinavana, which can be identified with the modern Sonana village. The Sundha Hill inscription states that Kirtipala's daughter Rudala-devi commissioned two Shiva temples at Javalipura. Kirtipala was a Hindu, but also patronized Jains. His 1161 Nadol grant portrays him as a worshipper of Surya (the sun), Agni (fire), and Maheshvara (Shiva). It then records a grant to a Jain temple.

He ruled the area around Jalore as a Chaulukya feudatory.  Reign  Samarasimha succeeded his father Kirtipala on the Chahamana throne of Javalipura. He had two brothers named Lakhanapala and Abhayapala, and a sister named Rudala-devi. In his inscriptions, he is styled as \\"Maharaja Samarasimha- deva\\". Samarasimha's 1182 CE Jalor stone inscription states that he \\"held in scorn\\" the nomadic tribes of Pilavahika (identified with modern Peelwa near Parbatsar). According to historian Dasharatha Sharma, this is a reference to his successful expeditions against the bandits of Pilavahika. The 1182 CE inscription mentions that Samarasimha's maternal uncle Jojala was a Rajya- Chintaka during his reign. This suggests that Jojala looked after the administration of the kingdom.  Public works  The 1185 Jalor inscription from Samarasimha's reign records the construction of a temple called Kuvara- Vihara. The temple was originally built by the Chaulukya monarch Kumarapala in the Kanchanagiri fort of Javalipura, in 1221 VS (1164-65 CE). It was rebuilt by Bhandari Yashovira in 1242 VS (1285-86 CE), on Samarasimha's orders. The original temple structure had been burnt by the Shakambhari Chahamana invader Vigraharaja IV during his war against the Chaulukyas. According to the Sundha Hill inscription, Samarasimha built extensive ramparts on the Kanakachala fort. G. H. Ojha identified Kanakachala with the fort of Jalor, same as Kanchanagiri fort mentioned in the 1185 CE inscription. According to D. R. Bhandarkar, Kanchanagiri or Kanakachala was the original name of the hill on which the fort was situated. Kirtipiala started the construction of a fort on this hill, and the work was completed by Samarasimha. The Sundha Hill temple further states that the king established the town of Samarapura, after having weighed himself against gold. The identity of Samarapura is not known. Samarasimha's sister Rudaladevi also commissioned two Shiva temples.  Personal life  Samarasimha had at least two sons and a daughter. His daughter Lila-devi married the Chaulukya monarch Bhima II. This is attested by the 1206 Kadi inscription of Bhima II. His two sons were Manavasimha and Udayasimha. The elder son Manavasimha was an ancestor of the founders of the Chauhan principalities of Chandravati and Abu. Udayasimha succeeded Samarasimha on the throne of Jalore.

The most powerful king of his dynasty, he overthrew the Chaulukya suzerainty, and became a sovereign ruler. However, some years later, he faced an invasion from the Delhi Sultanate, and became a tributary to the Sultan Iltutmish.  Early life  Udayasimha was a son of the Chahamana ruler Samarasimha. He had a brother named Manavasimha. His sister Lila-devi married the Chaulukya monarch Bhima II. Multiple inscriptions issued by Udayasimha have been found at Bhinmal: 1205 CE (Jagaswami temple), 1217 CE (Baraji resthouse), 1248 CE (Baraji resthouse) and 1249 CE (Nilkanth Mahadev temple). These mention his title as Maharajadhiraja.  Military career  Like his ancestors, Udayasimha served as a feudatory of the Chaulukya rulers of Gujarat in the early part of his reign. During the reign of the Chaulukya ruler Bhima II, the Chaulukyas faced a Yadava invasion from south. Taking advantage of this, three northern Chaulukya feudatories in the Marwar region formed an alliance and rebelled against the imperial rule. These included Udayasimha, Somasimha and Dharavarsha (the Paramara chief of Abu). In the ensuing battle, Udayasimha was wounded by the Chaulukya general Lavanaprasada, but the conflict appears to have ended with an advantage for Udayasimha. The Sundha Mata inscription declares that he could not conquered by the Gurjara (Chaulukya) king. Even the Chaulukya chronicle Kirti-Kaumudi states that Lavanaprasada had to conclude a treaty with the rebels, and return to the troubled Chaulukya capital. Before Udayasimha's ascension, his ancestral principality was largely confined to the area around Jalore. Udayasimha seems to have expanded his territory significantly. According to the Sundha Hill inscription, he ruled Javalipura (Jalor), Naddula (Nadol), Mandavyapura (Mandore), Vagabhatameru (Juna Barmer), Surachanda (Surachand), Ramasainya (Ramseen), Srimala (Bhinmal), and Satyapura (Sanchore), among other places. Historian Dasharatha Sharma theorizes that some of these places, which were earlier a part of the Chaulukya empire, came under Chahamana control while Lavanaprasada was busy fighting the Yadavas. The Sundha Hill inscription further states that Udayasimha put an end to Sindhuraja. D. R. Bhandarkar identified Sindhuraja with a Chahamana ruler of the Lata branch. However, A. K. Srivastava does not find this identification convincing, as Sindhuraja of Lata had been killed by the Yadava king Simhana. According to Dasharatha Sharma, this Sindhuraja might have been a weak ruler of Sindh. = Conflict with the Delhi Sultanate = Udayasimha appears to have become a tributary to the Delhi Sultanate at some point, but refused to pay the tribute, leading to a war sometime during 1211-1216 CE. This conflict has been described in the medieval Muslim chronicles, such as the 13th century Taj-ul-Maasir of Hasan Nizami (which mentions Udayasimha of Jalore as \\"Udi Sah of Jalewar\\"), and the 16th century Tarikh-i-Firishta (which calls him \\"Oodye-Sa of Jalwur or Udi Sah of Jalewar\\"). Firishta states that the Delhi Sultan Iltutmish marched to Jalore when Udayasimha discontinued the tribute payments. Hasan Nizami mentions that this army included prominent generals such as Rukn-ud-din Hamza, Izz-ud-din Bakhtiyar, Nasir-ud-din Mardan Shah, Nasir-ud-din Ali, and Badr-ud- din Saukartigin. Udayasimha took shelter in the Jalore fort, but surrendered as soon as some bastions of the fort were demolished. The Sultan accepted the surrender in return for a tribute of 100 camels and 20 horses, and then returned to Delhi. In 1221 CE, Iltutmish again launched an offensive against the Hindu rulers of present-day Rajasthan and Gujarat. Lavanaprasada's son Viradhavala and his minister Vastupala organized a confederacy of Hindu rulers, forcing the Delhi Sultan to retreat without a fight. According to the Gujarat chronicle Hammira-mada-mardana, the Chaulukya kingdom was invaded by three enemies: the Turushka (Turkic) ruler Milacchikara (Iltutmish), the Yadava king Singhana, and the Paramara king Devapala. The northern rebel feudatories (including Udayasimha) initially planned to side with the Turushkas, but Viradhavala convinced them to ally with the Chaulukyas. Iltutmish appears to have led another expedition against Udayasimha. According to the 12th century Muslim historian Minhaj-i-Siraj, Iltutmish conquered the Mandore fort in 1227 CE. Mandavyapura or Mandore, according to the Sundha Hil inscription, was in possession of Udayasimha. Several Hindu accounts mention that Udayasimha succeeded against the Turushkas (that is, the Delhi Sultanate). The Sundha Hill inscription credits him with curbing the power of the Turushkas. The 17th century chronicler Muhnot Nainsi states that \\"Sultan Jalal-ud-Din\\" attacked Jalore in 1241 CE, but was defeated and forced to retreat. Nainsi quotes a doha according to which the asuras (Muslims) drank water from Sundara lake with their mouths, but Udaya(-simha) took this water out of their wives' eyes in form of tears. The Jain legend in the Puratana- Prabandha-Sangraha collection gives a similar account, but states that the attack was led by a general named Malik Ambar. The Turkic army drank quenched its thirst at Sundara lake, and halted at the Sirana village. There, Rawal (king) Udayasimha defeated them: Malik Ambar was killed in the battle. The Puratana-Prabandha-Sangraha account goes on to mention that in 1253 CE, Jalal- ud-Din himself marched to Jalore. When the Delhi army damaged the fort using explosives, Udayasimha sent Rajaputra Bapada to negotiate a peace treaty with the invaders. Udayasimha agreed to Jalal-ud-Din's demand of 3,600,000 drammas (coins). Jalal-ud-Din also took as hostage Yashovira, a son of Udayasimha's minister. He then left for Delhi, and Udayasimha repaired the damaged walls of the fort. Since no Sultan named \\"Jalal-ud-Din\\" is known to have ruled during Udayasimha's lifetime, historian A. K. Srivastava theorizes that Hindu chroniclers used this name to refer to Iltutmish or one of his sons.  Cultural activities  According to the Sundha Hill inscription, Udayasimha was a scholar who was conversant with Bharatamukha-Mahagrantha. According to historian Dasharatha Sharma, this term refers to Mahabharata. A. K. Srivastava, however, identifies it with Bharat's Natya Shastra. He commissioned two Shiva temples at Javalipura. The text Nirbhaya-Bhimavyayoga states that it was composed during his reign.  Personal life  Udayasimha and his queen Prahaladava-devi had two sons: Chachigadeva (his successor) and Chamundaraja. According to a 1337 CE Bhinmal inscription, he had another son named Vahadasimha. Udayasimha's daughter married Virama, a son of the Chaulukya general (and later Vaghela king) Viradhavala. This marriage was probably in form of a matrimonial alliance. After Viradhavala's death, his sons Virama and Visala fought for the Vaghela throne. The Vaghela minister Vastupala supported Visala, because of which Virama was forced to flee the Vaghela kingdom. Virama took shelter with his in-laws, but the Chahamanas wanted to maintain good relations with the Vaghelas. Therefore, Udayasimha had Virama assassinated, possibly by his own son Chachigadeva. According to a Jain legend in the Puratana-Prabandha-Sangraha, Udayasimha later asked Visala to pay a tribute. Visala sent expeditions against Udayasimha, but failed to achieve any major success.

He maintained the borders of his ancestral kingdom intact, and achieved military successes against some neighbouring princes. He is most notable for issuing the Sundha Hill prashasti inscription, which provides historically valuable information about his ancestors.  Background  Chachigadeva was the eldest son of his predecessor Udayasimha and queen Prahaladava-devi. According to the 1284 CE Budhatra (Jodhpur) inscription of his daughter Rupadevi, he was also known as \\"Chacha\\". Several inscriptions from Chachigadeva's reign have been discovered. These include: * 1262 CE Sundha Hill inscription: notable for containing an account of the Chahamana rulers of Javalipura and their ancestors in Naddula * 1266 CE Jalore inscription * 1269 CE Sewari inscription (issued at Kareda) * 1276 CE Ratanpur inscription * Four Bhinmal inscriptions: 1271 CE, 1274 CE, 1277 CE, and 1278 CE The inscriptions usually give his title as Maharajadhiraja (\\"king of great kings\\") or Maharajakula. The Ratanpur inscription describes him as a Mahamandeshvara-raja. According to the 1274 CE Bhinmal inscription, his title was \\"Rajadhiraja\\" (king of kings); the 1277 CE inscription gives his title as \\"Maharajakula\\". Jakha or Jakahadeva was the prime minister of Chachigadeva, as attested by the 1266 CE Jalore and the 1276 CE Ratanpur inscriptions.  Military career  Chachigadeva appears to have maintain a sovereign status and the territory inherited from his father. The Sundha Hill inscription poetically describes him as \\"destroying the roaring Gurjara lord Virama, hating the enemy Salya, taking exquisite delight in felling the shaking (or leaping) PƒÅtaka, depriving of his colour Sanga, and a thunderbolt to the mountain - the furious Nahara\\". Virama can be identified with the Vaghela prince Virama-deva, who was married to Chachigadeva's sister. Virama and his brother Visala-deva both wanted the Vaghela throne after the death of their father. The Vaghela minister Vastupala supported Visala, because of which Virama was forced to flee the Vaghela kingdom. Virama took shelter with his in-laws, but the Chahamanas wanted to maintain good relations with the Vaghelas. Therefore, Chachigadeva treacherously murdered Virama. This event probably happened while Chachigadeva was still a prince. Salya was probably Salha, a ruler of the Chahamana branch of Sanchore and a distant cousin of Chachigadeva. Their fourth-generation ancestors - Kirtipala and Vijayasimha - were brothers. Sanchore is known to have been controlled by Chachigadeva's father Udayasimha. It is possible that Salha tried to assert his sovereignty, because of which he and Chachigadeva became enemies. Patuka has been identified as Pratapa-simha of Abu by Dasharatha Sharma. D. R. Bhandarkar, on the other hand, identified him as a cousin of Chachigadeva (a son of Udayasimha's brother Manavasimha). Bhandarkar identified Sanga Sangana, a ruler of Vanthali, by Bhandarkar. Dasharatha Sharma opposes this theory, arguing that Chachigadeva was a child at the time of Sangana's death. Nahara, according to Sharma, might have been a Muslim general.  Personal life  According to the 1284 CE inscription, Chachigadeva's wife was Lakshmi-devi. The couple had a daughter named Rupa-devi, who married the king Teja-simha (possibly a Guhila ruler, according to G. H. Ojha). According to the 17th century chronicler Munhot Nainsi, Chachigadeva had three sons: Samantasimha (his successor), Chahadadeva, and Chandra. Chachigadeva's successor was Samantasimha, who was probably his son, although the relationship between these two persons is not certain.  Cultural activities  The Sundha Hill inscription states that Chachigadeva waived some taxes at Shrimala (Bhinmal). At Ramasainya (modern Ramseen), he donated funds for the temple of the deity Vigrahaditya. For the temple of the gold Aparajitesha, he commissioned a golden cupola, a silver girdle, a hall, a ratha studded with precious stones, and a flag staff. He worshipped the goddess Aghateshvari (Chamunda) at Sugandhadri (modern Sundha Hill), and commissioned a mandapa at her temple. He also patronized Jainism: he granted a village to a Parshvanatha shrine at Karaheda. The Sundha Hill prashasti (eulogy) of his family was composed by a Jain yati (monk).

Early life and education John G. Agar was born in New Orleans on June 3, 1856 to William Agar and Theresa Price. In 1876, he graduated with a B.A. from the Georgetown University. Followed by a Masters of Arts in 1888 and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1889 and a Doctor of Laws in 1910. In 1878, he attended the Columbia College Law School and graduated in 1880. On February 28, 1892, he married Agnes Louis Macdonough. Together, they had five children including Herbert Agar, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History. His son and namesake John G. Agar Jr. died in WW I in October 1918 at St. Mihiel, northern France. Career In 1881, Agar was appointed Assistant Attorney for the Southern District New York by President Garfield. He resigned in 1882 to become a senior member of Agar, Ely, and Fulton, a role he held until his death. In 1896, he was named a school commissioner on the New York City Board of Education and is credited for removing education from politics and obtaining better funding for public schools. He resigned as school commissioner in 1899 after faulting Tammany Hall for not releasing the funds raised for building and improving schools; removing the requirement for teachers to hold a license; and giving more power to those in politics to choose principals that aligned with their beliefs rather than the best for the job. Due to these defects, Agar declared he could not accomplish anything good for the public school system. After his resignation, Agar proposed to fix these defects by making the Board of Education separate from the political governance of the city; control over finances through a school tax that would fund public schools; and limit the number of school Commissioners to increase their control of funds and responsibilities. From 1906 to 1908, he was a member of the Municipal Art Society (MAS) and president of the Reform Club. In 1908 and 1909, he was president of MAS followed by service as the third president of the National Arts Club from 1910 - 1932. In 1913, Agar delivered a speech at the 8th annual Fifty Books of the Year Exhibition at the National Arts Club, where he announced the founding of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. The organization was to promote and encourage those in the graphic arts to exchange views, publish books and periodicals, hold exhibitions and lectures, and promote higher education in the arts. In 1924, he was award the AIGA Medal. In 1916, he was appointed Knight of the Order of St Gregory by Pope Benedict XV and was a trustee of St. Patrick's Cathedral. And in 1928, he became president of the Arts Council of New York City. In 1926, Agar successfully petitioned the New York Court of Appeals to raise the requirements for admission to the bar. Agar produced a report with the Committee on Character that described ignorance and unfitness among a large population of the candidates for the bar and recommended that at least two years in college in addition to three years in a recognized law school be required.

The CSP&KC; was the first of the three to put its depots in the downtown area. with Initially it built two depots in Waterloo, one on the west side of the Cedar River and one on the east side.

Otto P√©rez, when he was president of the country, tried to lead a legalization drive, and some congressmen tried to pass a law for legalization, but those efforts failed. A poll conducted in 2012 said that 41% of Guatemalans might support decriminalization. History One early law restricting cannabis was Decree 1331 of 1932, which restricted \\"plantas letales\\" to include \\"Indian hemp and marihuana\\". In 2012, former Guatemalan president Otto P√©rez announced his support for decriminalizing drugs, but he said that the United States boycotted his plans. He nevertheless tried to promote the idea in diverse forums, culminating in a speech he gave before the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 26 September 2012. A poll in that year revealed that 41% of Guatemalans thought that decriminalization was a good idea. In 2016 the Commission of legislation and constitutional points of Congress (Spanish: Comisi√≥n de Legislaci√≥n y Puntos Constitucionales del Congreso) in Guatemala rejected the Law to regulate the cultivation, production, distribution, commercialization, medicinal and recreational consumption of cannabis (Spanish: Ley para Regular el Cultivo, Producci√≥n, Distribuci√≥n, Comercializaci√≥n y Consumo Medicinal y Recreativo del Cannabis) as \\"unfeasible, inopportune, and unconstitutional\\". The law had been proposed in April of that year by the congressmen from the party Convergencia. Alvaro Vel√°zquez, one of the congressmen, had said he would keep trying for the initiative to advance but he died in 2017.  Conviction and sentences  According to Guatemalan law, cannabis is illegal, as of 2016, and a person convicted of personal consumption of a drug (including cannabis) would be sentenced to a minimum of 4 months in jail and a 200 quetzals fine, and up to 5 years and a 10,000 quetzals fine, but because \\"personal consumption\\" is not defined properly, the prosecutor can accuse the person of traffic and the judge may give a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

McLaurin (September 16, 1887 ‚Äì September 4, 1968) was an American professor, and the first African-American to attend the University of Oklahoma. McLaurin held a master's degree from the University of Kansas and was a retired professor living in Oklahoma City. Before retirement, he taught at a predominantly black college, Langston University. He applied and was accepted into the University of Oklahoma in 1948, as a result of the United States Supreme Court decision in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, concerning his application, which enabled African Americans to be admitted to graduate education at the University of Oklahoma on a segregated basis. In the case, McLaurin was supported by Thurgood Marshall, Amos T. Hall, Roscoe Dunjee, and five other African American students. The University was required by law to allow McLaurin into the school, but he was entirely segregated from the other students. Later when other African-American students were admitted into the school, they went through similar conditions such as different classrooms, libraries, cafeterias, and restrooms. On September 29, 1948, a federal court ruled that the University of Oklahoma's denial to admit McLaurin was unconstitutional. To comply with segregation laws, the president of the university, George Lynn Cross, arranged for McLaurin's classes to be held in classrooms with an anteroom: this way, McLaurin could sit away from the white students while still attending all his classes. Other special accommodations that were created to continue segregation include special seating areas at the cafeteria and sporting events, and separate restroom facilities. In retaliation of these conditions, McLaurin filed a suit stating that these conditions deprived him of equality. The District Court was not in agreement with his argument and denied his motion for the reason that racial segregation is a \\"deeply rooted social policy of the State of Oklahoma.\\" Afterwards, McLaurin brought his case up again but this time he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. This would begin the timeline of the McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education suit. In McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, McLaurin argued that the Fourteenth Amendment was being violated by how they were being treated. It was not until 1950 that the Supreme Court ruled that the treatment must be equal between White and African American students. Mclaurin v Oklahoma State Regents was an important case in history because it was one of the first cases that attempted to combat the \\"separate but equal\\" provision in the Plessy v Ferguson case. Mclaurin v Oklahoma showed how the \\"separate but equal\\" provision can still be manipulated in a way that discriminates against individuals on the basis of race. This case played an influential role in history because its ruling led the way to the eventual overturning of Plessy v Ferguson. The Mclaurin case showed the inequality in the separate but equal provision, the accommodations made for Mclaurin required that he sit separate from the other students, in an alcove labeled \\"reserved of colored\\", he sat alone in the cafeteria and he also had his own desk in the library which was behind a stack of newspapers so he would not be seen by the white students. All of these discriminatory practices happened under the umbrella of the separate but equal provision.\\" In 1950 a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that McLaurin had not received equal treatment as required by the Constitution. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Frederick M. Vinson wrote that McLaurin was \\"handicapped in his pursuit of effective graduate instruction. Such restrictions impair and inhibit his ability to study, to engage in discussion and exchange views with other students, and in general to learn his professions.\\" Currently, there is a meeting named after George A. McLaurin on the campus called The George McLaurin Male Leadership Conference. The conference is mainly intended for the recruitment of first-generation college students, and particularly those within minority groups. https://www.nps.gov/nhl/find/statelists/ok/Bizzell.pdf  References  1887 births 1968 deaths University of Oklahoma alumni School desegregation pioneers Langston University faculty Activists from Oklahoma ","title":"George W.

Plants in this genus are woolly shrubs with five petals joined to form a tube-shaped flower with four stamens of unequal lengths. These species are similar to those in the genus Pityrodia except that the branches are distinctly 4-angled in cross section and the fruit has calluses or ridges. Description Plants in the genus Muniria are evergreen shrubs, tall and densely covered with woolly hairs. The stems and branches are four-angled in cross section. The leaves are simple, elliptic to egg-shaped, arranged in opposite pairs, covered with woolly hairs and glands. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to twelve in leaf axils and single flowers or groups are surrounded by leaf-like bracteoles. Flowers have five sepals which are joined for about half their length to form a tube with five lobes. The five petals are pale yellow to red and form a slightly curved tube with five lobes on the end, the upper lobes slightly shorter than the lower ones. There are four stamens with the lower pair shorter than the upper ones. The fruit is dry, does not release its seeds when mature and has ridges or calluses. Taxonomy and naming The genus was first described by Nikola Streiber and Barry Conn in 2011 and the description was published Australian Systematic Botany. The type species is Muniria quadrangulata which was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir as Pityrodia quadrangulata. In 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nikola Streiber transferred P. quadrangulata and three others in that genus to the new genus Muniria.

Theodore Joset (Chinese: Ëã•ÁëüÁ•ûÁà∂, 7 October 1804 ‚Äì 5 August 1842) was a Swiss priest and the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong. Early Life and Ecclesiastical Career Fr. Josef was born in Courfaivre, Switzerland in 1804. He was ordained as a diocesan priest at Fribourg in 1831 and subsequently spent two years at Saignel√©gier. He was then appointed as the representative of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith in the Portuguese colony of Macau. He departed for China on 13 August 1833 and arrived 15 months later in Macau on 15 November 1834. Fr. Josef was to assist Raphael Umpierres, the Procurator of the mission at Macau, and then succeeded the position in 1835. On 17 Dec 1839, he was also appointed consul general to Charles Albert, King of Sardinia. Establishment of Apostolic Prefecture in Hong Kong The need for pastoral care in Hong Kong had come to the attention of Fr. Josef during the First Opium War. The British troops stationing in Hong Kong, many of them were Irish and Catholic, had no army chaplains, and only had Macau to look to for religious support. Given the alarming rate of illness and death among British soldiers there, Fr. Josef realized that the services of Catholic priests had become an urgent requirement in Hong Kong. Fr. Joset then wrote to Rome from Macau and urged the Church to recognize Hong Kong's situation and the need to begin a mission there. Consequently, Pope Gregory XVI decreed to create an Apostolic Prefecture that would include \\"Hong Kong with the surrounding six leagues,\\" and would be independent of the Macau Diocese, on 22 April 1841. This was only 3 months after the British first hoisted their flag in Hong Kong and well before the signing of Treaty of Nanking, which would formally cede Hong Kong to Britain, in August 1842. Fr. Joset was appointed as Hong Kong's first Prefect Apostolic. Fr. Joset's action and the Church's response enraged the Portuguese authorities in Macau, who claimed jurisdiction on Hong Kong. He, along with other priests and Chinese seminarians, were banished from Macau by the Macau authorities. Work in Hong Kong as Prefect Apostolic Fr. Joset and the other banished priests and seminarians arrived in Hong Kong on 3 March 1942. The prime concern of the newly established Apostolic Prefecture was to serve the religious needs of Irish soldiers. Fr. Joset not only diligently carried on his duties as procurator, but also started at once to build the Mission House, arrange for a site and building materials for the church, and level sites for the cemetery, the seminary, and other institutions. He oversaw the laying of foundation stone of the first Catholic church in Hong Kong dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in Wellington Street on 7 June 1842. Death and Burial After arriving in Hong Kong for a short few months, Fr Joset was dead of fever on 5 August 1842, at the age of 38. After his death, Fr. Joset was remembered as the founder of Hong Kong's Catholic Church. He was laid to rest behind the main altar of the Catholic Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, beneath a marble slab on which said: ‚Äú Here awaiting the Resurrection are the mortal remains of Theodore Joset, Swiss priest of the Propaganda Fide, Apostolic Representative, Procurator of China, First Apostolic Prefect of Hong Kong and of all the Missions.

Composition  The proteins within the WRC form a CYFIP1-Nap1 heterodimer and a WAVE1-Abi2-HSPC300 heterotrimer, and following interaction with Rac1, the holocomplex has been observed in a CYFIP1-Nap1-Abi2 heterotrimer subcomplex and an active WAVE1-HSPC300 heterodimer subcomplex.  Function  WRC recruitment to the sites of actin nucleation events at the cell periphery is mediated by the binding of a number of ligands containing a conserved WRC interacting receptor sequence (WIRS) which binds to a conserved location shared across the surfaces of Abi2 and CYFIP1. The WRC is activated by interaction with the Rac1 (via the CYFIP1 component of the complex) and Arf small GTPases (such as ARF1, ARF5, and ARF6 ) or the similar protein ARL1, which causes dissociation of the CYFIP1-Nap1-Abi2 heterotrimer at the membrane periphery. This allows the V domain of the WAVE1 component to interact with the actin monomers while its CA domain interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, allowing the Arp2/3 complex to act as a nucleation core for the branching and extension of actin filaments.

It is located in a park in front of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and was completed on July 1, 2013, coinciding with the 120th anniversary of the founding of the city. According to Nikolai Kolchanov, the director of the institute, the monument commemorates the sacrifice of the mice in genetic research used to understand biological and physiological mechanisms for developing new drugs and curing of diseases. Description The monument, which sits on a granite pedestal, is of a laboratory mouse wearing pince-nez on the tip of its nose. The mouse holds knitting needles in its paws and is shown knitting a double helix of DNA. The bronze figure is itself only 70 cm (27¬Ω‚Äù) high, but the total height of the monument including the pedestal is 2.5 meters (98\\"). The DNA spiral emerging from the knitting needles winds to the left, thus showing that it is the still poorly understood Z-DNA - this symbolic of scientific research that is still to be done. In contrast, the more common B-DNA (depicted in school lessons) winds to the right. Background The foundation stone of the monument was laid on June 1, 2012, in honor of the 55th anniversary of the founding of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics. The design for the mouse was the creation of the Novosibirsk artist Andrey Kharkevich, who made more than ten sketches before settling on a final design. It was from among the different versions of the classic and stylized image animals that a mouse knitting the DNA helix was selected. Andrei Kharkevich described the statue as: \\"Here, the images of a laboratory mouse and a scientist are combined because they are connected to each other and serve one cause. The mouse is shown at the exact time of scientific discovery. If you peer into its eyes, you can see that this mouse has already invented something. But the whole symphony of scientific discovery, joy, \\"Eureka!\\" has not yet sounded.\\" Sculptor Alexei Agrikolyansky, who made the statue, confessed that it had not been easy to capture that moment as the mouse was obviously not human and yet he had to produce a character and emotions for the mouse that were believable and, while maintaining the anatomical proportions, create something that neither looked like a cartoon character nor a real mouse. The sculpture was cast from bronze in Tomsk by Maxim Petrov.

Biography  Ren Yuandao was born in the Jiangsu Province during the late Qing Dynasty. He joined the Beiyang Army and studied a military academy in Japan before the Xinhai Revolution broke out in 1911. Ren later served in the National Revolutionary Army and also held some administrative positions in the Nationalist government. He commanded the garrison in the Beijing-Tianjin area during the 1930s, and after gathering 10,000 men and three torpedo boats, he defected to the pro-Japanese Reformed Government of the Republic of China under Liang Hongzhi. Despite joining Wang Jingwei's Reorganized National Government in Nanjing in 1939-40, Ren maintained contacts with the Nationalist intelligence agency and provided them with information. During his time with the Wang Jingwei regime he held the post of Minister of the Navy from 1940 to 1945 (acting, 1940‚Äì42). He was also a member of the National Military Council (1940‚Äì42) and the Governor of the Jiangsu Province (1944‚Äì45).

Born in Barcaldine, Queensland, he was educated at Brisbane Grammar School before becoming a teacher at the Brisbane Normal School. At the outbreak of World War One, Little enlisted in the military at the age of 21. Little was assigned to the 15th battalion and spent some time encamped in Egypt before arriving at Gallipoli on the afternoon of 25 April 1915. On 14 May, Little was given a field commission as a 2nd Lieutenant, due to the loss of officers in the unit due to Turkish snipers and bombs. On 26 May, Little was badly injured defending his trench against a Turkish attack; when a bomb that he was holding exploded in his hand. He was evacuated to a hospital ship, where both of his eyes had to be removed, and his right hand amputated. Little's family in Australia were given conflicting reports on his injuries, with one report stating he was not seriously injured, while another listed him as killed in action. While recovering from his injuries, Little married a nurse, Miss Bessy Crowther. Upon his return to Australia, Little tried to enter politics, standing as a Nationalist candidate in the Electoral district of Bremer at the 1918 election, but he was defeated by future Labor Premier Frank Cooper. Little then turned his attention to writing, contributing prolifically to such publications such as The Queenslander on a variety of topics, including short stories and advocacy for disabled persons. At the end of the war, Little became the inaugural President of his branch of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League, an organisation that later became the RSL.

Active throughout the 1990s, the group comprised Patrick Foster on guitar and vocals, Andy Duboc on bass, and David Bishop on drums. Throughout their initial decade of activity, the group remained committedly DIY, recording and publishing their music themselves while holding down full-time jobs, earning them the title of \\"hardest working band in America.\\" History Starting in 1985 guitarists Patrick Foster and Brad Maylor, along with bass player Andy Duboc, were part of the collegiate indie rock band Empty Box in Charlottesville, Virginia. Before Empty Box disbanded in 1989, David Bishop had joined on drums and the four musicians went on to reconstruct the group in 1990 under the name Wingtip Sloat. By 1991 Maylor had left the band, and Sloat continued on as a trio, practicing in the basement of Duboc's parents' house and recording sessions on 4-track tape. They released several rough recordings on cassette, and then some more refined material on 7\\" vinyl via their own label, Sweet Portable Junket, derived from their similarly named fanzine, Sweet Portable You. The group went to great lengths to print and collate their records in uniquely handmade wrappers, rounding out a staunch do-it-yourself aesthetic for the band. The group's early sound was reminiscent of other DC-area post-hardcore artists affiliated with Dischord Records, but Wingtip's Sloat's lo-fi sound and penchant for New Zealand pop set them apart. Wingtip Sloat's heavy airplay on college radio and occasional tours along the East Coast, sometimes as openers for acts like Pavement, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 and Sebadoh, created a buzz in the American indie rock scene. They were also a favorite of British DJ John Peel who played them a lot on BBC Radio and raved about the group to Rolling Stone magazine. The group contributed tracks to several compilations, released split records with like-minded bands, and were known for covering songs by seminal, contemporary, and often obscure indie artists who'd influenced their sound: Swell Maps, Tall Dwarfs, The Clean, Sun City Girls, Happy Go Licky, World of Pooh, Galaxie 500, Minutemen, and others. Much of Sloat's material was released by Rake bassist Bill Kellum's DC-area label VHF Records, including two LPs of more polished-sounding material: 1995's Chewyfoot and 1998's If Only for the Hatchery. Though the band's progress was sometimes slowed by the members' work in their various fields of printing, contracting, and accounting, they continued to practice several times a week. Following prominent concerts in the late 1990s with Sonic Youth, Spoon, and Mike Watt, Wingtip Sloat's members shifted their priorities to family life, and the group disappeared from the public eye. Wingtip Sloat's early vinyl releases and many compilation tracks resurfaced on the CD collection, Add This to the Rhetoric, in 2007. Meanwhile the band continued to write and record material, even after Bishop's relocation to Louisville, Kentucky in 2004. Recordings from 2015‚Äì2016 would surface as the albums Purge and Swell and Lost Decade in 2018. Released as a combined LP-and-CD release, as well as via the online indie music streaming service Bandcamp, these first new Wingtip Sloat tracks to appear in 20 years contained rehearsal tapes, bits of poetry, instrumental breaks, and original songs alongside cover versions of compositions by Belle & Sebastian, Bob Dylan, Brian Eno, and Wire.

A court in Eastern Germany had condemned Marquardt, an amateur psychic and cartomancy practitioner, to twelve years' imprisonment. The verdict referred to so called Kriegs- und Boykotthetze, incitement to war and boycott: Marquardt had provided favorable forecasts for families preparing to leave East Germany, and when arrested, was in possession of an astrological handbook including a horoscope with a positive outlook on Western Germany. The judgment has been deemed barbaric and was mentioned several times in documentations about Unrechtsjustiz, systematic injustice in the GDR.  Background of Marquardt  Charlotte Marquardt grew up in the family of a metal worker in Berlin- Wei√üensee. She worked as a telephone operator and typist, and in 1927 married an officer of the Schutzpolizei, who was transferred to Suhl. Marquardt was a housekeeper and had two sons with her husband. During the war, after her husband moved to Litzmannstadt (≈Å√≥d≈∫) in occupied Poland, she became acquainted with fortune-telling via her Polish housekeeper and began to practice it herself. The marriage ended in divorce; Marquardt's elder son was killed in action during auxiliary flak service while still a minor. She was then evacuated to Suhl with her younger son. She worked in a factory and continued practicing cartomancy for acquaintances, often in exchange for food or other goods. She started to do so within her family and friends but acquired a reputation within a larger circle. In 1946, Artur Hofmann, KPD minister of the interior, issued a ban on commercial divination, chiromancy, phrenology and astrology in neighboring Saxony. There were penalties of up to 150 Reichsmark and the allocation of suspects to the Labor Office for reconstruction work. Under the German Empire and the Weimar Republic, divination had not been legally condemned, but the police forces of the various states had kept an eye on professional practitioners. Marquardt's card reading gained the envy of a neighbor. Starting in 1946 she filed reports with the police about Marquardt's guests and practices. The reports were unsuccessful at first, as Marquardt did not take money for her services. In 1950 Marquardt started to work in the Suhl city library. She was fired in 1955 after providing a blacklisted book to a reader.  Arrest, legal proceedings and verdict  Marquardt was arrested in 1955 after coming back from a visit to West Berlin, where she had met her brother. A Stasi lieutenant called Stoschek had identified various families whom Marquardt had advised from in 1951 prior to their leaving East Germany for the West. She had tried to predict a favorable timing and had backed the basic decision to leave for Western Germany. She was therefore prosecuted for \\"incitement to boycott and war under Article 6 of the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic\\". On April 20, 1956, the Suhl SED newspaper, Freies Wort, published a report titled \\"Righteous atonement for unscrupulous abdication\\" about the verdict. The written reasons of the judgement mention, as well a national horoscope of the Federal Republic of Germany, a further attempt to boycott and make a case for war. The horoscope had been found in a \\"Lorcher Astrologischer Kalender auf das Jahr 1956\\", an astrological calendar published by Karl Rohm in Lorch. When Marquardt was arrested, the calendar was still packed in the original cover, as she had received it as a present from her brother during her visit in Berlin. The mentioned horoscope for the Federal Republik of Germany predicted a decisive role of the western part in a future reunified Germany, based on a lucky junction, an astrological aspect (trine) between Jupiter, the Sun, and the Moon. The protocol of Marquardt's police interrogation alleges that her brother, as a Western agent, tried to convince Marquardt to spread propaganda supporting German unity according to the Bonner Muster (the pattern of Bonn). Marquardt served her sentence in Hoheneck women's prison near Stollberg in the Erzgebirge. Several applications for early release were refused. She was released on probation in 1962. The authorities believed there was no longer a risk, as ‚Äì after the construction of the wall ‚Äì she would not be able to leave East Germany. Marquardt went to stay with the family of Ilse Gratz, a former inmate; they had become friends in Hoheneck. Gratz was relatively \\"small fry\\"; she had been sentenced to three years' imprisonment after recommending friends go to see her brother, who ran a hotel in West Germany. At the time as a mother with two small children she had been arrested on Christmas Eve in 1955, but was released one year later due to an amnesty. Marquardt's health was impaired by the harsh conditions of her imprisonment. She died of thyroid cancer in 1975.  Documentation  The fate of Marquardt has been documented in contemporary Western German collections about systematic injustice and the state of human rights in the GDR. Baldur Haase provided an account of the story in a documentary narrative.¬ªDie Kartenlegerin von Suhl: 'Ich bin bei der Stasi gefangen ...' 1955/56¬´, dokumentarisch erz√§hlt von Baldur Haase, Erfurt 1998, , published 1998 at the state of Thuringia Stasi Records Agency Commissioner. Haase himself was sentenced at the age of 20 to three years in prison and remained under close surveillance until the end of the GDR. Like Marquardt he was jailed for possessing a book, as he had received and read George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four in an exchange with pen pals in western countries. After 1989, Haase became an author and was in demand as a Zeitzeuge, a witness recounting his experiences and that of others in lectures and readings to various audiences.

As a religious teacher, he was not fully ordained and was more or less under the supervision of another missionary.

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 334 F. Supp. 1257 (E.D. Pa. 1971), was a case where the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was sued by the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (PARC), now The Arc of Pennsylvania, over a law that gave public schools the authority to deny a free education to children who had reached the age of 8, yet had not reached the mental age of 5. The law had also been used by the state in multiple occasions to deny free public education to children who had a hard time integrating into classroom environments and schools. This was the first major legal case to provide equality to students with disabilities. The case was filed and settled by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and lasted between 1971-1972. The case was over seen by three judges, Circuit Judge Adams, and two District Judges, Masterson and Broderick. The language used during this case is outdated to modern times; therefore, the use of the word \\"mentally retarded\\" refers to any intellectual disability.  Argument  The argument of the case was that all children, whether having an intellectual disability or not, could benefit from any type of free training or education. It was also argued that not having free educational resources will negatively affect the way a child develops. Although children with intellectual disability would benefit differently than other children, they would be able to develop levels of self-care. Furthermore, the more education they received, the more they could continue to benefit. Pennsylvania's education laws at that time allowed the students' rights of due process to be denied along with a free public education. This was argued by the plaintiffs to be both unlawful and unjust.  Plaintiffs  Thomas Gilhool, the lead plaintiff's attorney in PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, discusses the strategy of the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia in its decision to pursue PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania prior to Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman (1984); part of a panel discussion, \\"The Disability Rights Movement: From Pennhurst Until Today\\", U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, Washington, D.C., 27 June 2016. The plaintiffs in the case are the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens and the families of children with intellectual disabilities who were denied an education. The Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (PARC) is a non-profit organization created in 1949 with goals of advancing the interests of citizens with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) in Pennsylvania, along with ensuring that people with I/DD get their share and equal resources that is given to all citizens of the state. During the time of the case, PARC had member chapters in 53 out of the 67 counties in Pennsylvania. The PARC chapters ran education programs for children with intellectual disabilities and had been doing so for up to 20 years before the case. The families that sued along with the PARC all had children that were of school age (6-21), were identified as having an intellectual disability, and were denied free public education from the state of Pennsylvania due to an intellectual disability. All of the families claimed that their child would benefit from the free education they had so wrongfully been denied. Each family had also elected their child to be entered into public schools. Thirteen families sued all together.  Defendants  1) The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania - overall responsible for the education of Pennsylvania's children 2) David H. Kurtzman - Pennsylvania's Secretary of Education 3) The State Board of Education 4) Joseph Adlestine - Acting Secretary of Public Welfare of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 5) the following school districts of Pennsylvania: * Philadelphia School District * Allegheny County School District * West Homestead School District * Berks County School District * Governor Mifflin School District * Shaler Township School District * Wilson School District * Marple - Newtown School District * Pittsburgh School District * Reading School District * Susquehanna County School District * Mountain - View School District  Ruling  Early in 1972 the two sides settled after the evidence that was provided had been evaluated. A consent decree was given by the U.S. District Court Judge Masterson that ruled the existing law restricting kids ages six to twenty-one years of age was unconstitutional. It was also stated that Pennsylvania was responsible for providing free public education to all children; that meant that no child, regardless of their disability, could be turned down by the Commonwealth to the access of free public trainings and educational programs. The quality of the education and training given to the children with disabilities had to match that of the education and training given to general students.  After the case  Pennsylvania was not the only state at the time with legislation that restricted education to students with disabilities. Other states enforced similar laws. However, Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (PARC) v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, was the first time education restricting legislation was contested and defeated. Although the case only stayed at the district level, other cases involving children with disabilities and their fight for educational equality rose. Mills v. Board of Education of District of Columbia was another such case that took place later in 1972, and this case received enough attention to go to the Supreme Court.

Biography  Dale Spalding grew up in Downey, California, in a family of four children. As a teenager, he became interested in harmonica after listening to an album by Paul Butterfield. He also started playing the guitar. He is fascinated by rhythm and blues from New Orleans, Big Band Swing and British Invasion. He is also interested in blues legends like Muddy Waters, BB King, Little Walter, John Lee Hooker, and Canned Heat. Spalding also followed several musicians playing in Los Angeles, such as the Ashgrove and the Golden Bear. In 1969, Spalding moved to San Francisco, where he played in clubs and studied harmonica with bluesman Sonny Terry. Terry introduced Spalding to his friends, among them Brownie McGhee, Willie Dixon, Johnny Shines, Lafayette Leake and Big Walter \\"Shakey\\" Horton. Spalding later formed a duet with Duke Burrell, the pianist of Louis Jordan. Duke discovered Spalding's talent as a vocalist and encouraged him to sing more. The duet played together for ten years, during which Duke taught him a variety of jazz classics and ballads. After the death of Burrell in the early 1990s, Spalding went back to Los Angeles, where he formed the Dale Spalding Band with bassist Tom Gargano, his long-time friend. The Dale Spalding Band regularly performs in Los Angeles, and has played with various musicians, including drummer James Gadson, saxophonist Lon Price and pianist Bruce \\"Funky Mal\\" Malament. In 2000, Mexican conguero Poncho Sanchez discovered the Dale Spalding Band, and Spalding and Sanchez started working together. Spalding toured several times with Sanchez in the US and Japan. He also worked with Sanchez on Latin Spirits, and played the harmonica on the 2003 song '\\"MaryAnn\\", with Ray Charles on vocal. In 2005, Spalding moved to New Orleans, and started working with roots rock band The Iguanas. Hurricane Katrina forced him to move once more, this time to Austin, Texas, where he played with Little Elmore Reed's band.

The anarchist movement in Chile emerged from European immigrants, followers of Mikhail Bakunin affiliated with the International Workingmen's Association, who contacted Manuel Chinchilla, a Spaniard living in Iquique. Their influence could be perceived at first within the labour unions of typographers, painters, builders and sailors. During the first decades of the 20th century, anarchism had a significant influence on the labour movement and intellectual circles of Chile. Some of the most prominent Chilean anarchists were: the poet Carlos Pezoa V√©liz, the professor Dr Juan Gandulfo, the syndicalist workers Luis Olea, Magno Espinoza, Alejandro Escobar y Carballo, √Ångela Mu√±oz Arancibia, Juan Chamorro, Armando Trivi√±o and Ernesto Miranda, the teacher Flora Sanhueza, and the writers Jos√© Domingo G√≥mez Rojas, Fernando Santiv√°n, Jos√© Santos Gonz√°lez Vera and Manuel Rojas. At the moment, anarchist groups are experiencing a comeback in Chile through various student collectives, affinity groups, community and cultural centres, and squatting.  History of Chilean anarchism   First stage: The early years (1880‚Äì1921)  Carlos Pezoa V√©liz. = First publications = Anarchist propaganda began circulating in Chile around 1880, consisting of literary works arriving from Spain and Argentina. The first libertarian newspaper, El Oprimido, was published in 1893 in Valpara√≠so, followed by others such as: El √Åcrata, La Luz, La Revuelta, La Batalla, El Surco, Acci√≥n Directa and others. La Batalla was published continually for a longer period of time, between 1912 and 1926. There were also various newspapers published by general unions with anarchist tendencies, such as: El Siglo XX, La Imprenta (typographers) and El Mar√≠timo in Antofagasta (sailors).Luis Vitale, Contribuci√≥n a una Historia del Anarquismo en Am√©rica Latina; pg. 26 After the Russian Revolution (which was regarded with distrust by most anarchists from the very beginning), the differences between anarchists and Marxists deepened. Their cohabitation within general unions came to an end, and the moderate and reformist socialists took over the Workers' Federation of Chile (FOCH).Cappelletti & Rama (1990); op. cit. pag. In December 1919, the Chilean wing of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was founded in Valparaiso. The Chilean IWW differed from the revolutionary workers' organisation in the United States: in Chile, it had clearer anarcho-syndicalist tendencies than in the US, and was more a revolutionary and syndicalist organisation rather than a libertarian one. The IWW had a national reach, from Iquique to Corral. They declared themselves as enemies of the capital, the government, and the church, and their usual tactics were striking, boycotting and sabotaging. It had an enormous influence on the sailors of Valpara√≠so, Iquique and Antofagasta, and it organised the bakers', ammunition manufacturers', builders' and shoemakers' syndicates. Its most famous wobblies (members) were Juan Onofre Chamorro, Armando Trivi√±o, Pedro Ortuzar and Porfirio Soto, among others. As far as anarchist literature was concerned, the publishing house Editorial Lux distinguished itself by printing books by Chilean and European anarchists such as Manuel M√°rquez and Jos√© Domingo G√≥mez Rojas. Among other notable militants were the typographer Enrique Arenas from Iquique, founder of a number of anarchist newspapers, as well as Luis Olea, Alejandro Magno Espinosa and Alejandro Escobar y Carballo, the driving force behind several general unions (Cappelletti, LXXXV). = General Unions and Co-operatives vs Benefit Societies = On 1 May 1889, Chilean anarchists first commemorated the Haymarket affair with a crowded public manifestation. A year prior, in 1898, they had founded the Carpenters and Woodworkers' Society, the Caupolic√°n Society for Education and Mutual Aid, and the Railroad Workers' General Union, all of them of anarchist inspiration. In 1901, the Italian lawyer and anarchist theorist Pietro Gori visited Chile, and his influence strengthened the ideological principles of the Chilean anarchists. The first general unions (trade unions organised by profession or specific branches) were created between 1901 and 1902, for professions such as carpenters, railroad workers, sailors, watchmakers, bakers, tram conductors, plasterers, shoemakers, furniture makers, graphic artists and coal merchants. Some of the notable activists during this period were Marcos Y√°nez, Belarmino Orellana, Eugenio Sagredo Jim√©nez, Luis Morales and Manuel Guerra. These general unions were soon engaged in conflict with the older and newer benefit societies, which had been in existence since the mid-nineteenth century, and which they considered incapable of defending the interests of the working class. The newspaper El Faro criticised the old benefit societies, branding them as \\"the mutualist mummies that have been eternally vegetating without any sort of practical profit, or the economical development of which they should be responsible as the developers of all kinds of social wealth\\". The newspaper Siglo XX had a similar position on the matter: \\"It is essential within these societies to assure the payment of the quotas of their members, with no care whatsoever given to whether the individual actually has the resources to meet them or not (...) These societies are powerless in defending the privileges and the interests of the proletariat\\".Luis Vitale, Contribuci√≥n a una Historia del Anarquismo en Am√©rica Latina; pg. 27 Anarcha-feminism also started to develop at the beginning of the century, inspired by the writings of Louise Michel, Voltairine de Cleyre, Lucy Parsons and Emma Goldman. This context of a growing working-class movement set the basis for the emergence of co-operatives, which adopted a strictly defensive position despite their anarcho-syndicalist inspiration. The first co-operative was founded by dockworkers in Iquique on 1 May 1900, and later ones emerged in Antofagasta, Cha√±aral and Copiap√≥. In 1904 the first National Convention of Co-operatives was organised in Santiago, with the participation of 20 000 members from 15 organisations. The defensive character of these organisations meant that most co-operatives were under the control of socialists and Marxists, particularly members of the Democrat Party. Many of these went on to form the Workers' Federation of Chile (FOCH). The Trotskyist historian Luis Vitale talked about the unifying effect of these organisations. The red-and-black flag of anarchy. = The First Demonstrations = One of the first conflicts triggered by the anarchists was \\"the Great Boatmen Strike\\" of 1890, which took place in Iquique, Antofagasta, Valpara√≠so, Concepci√≥n and other smaller ports. A strike broke out in Valpara√≠so in 1903 at the South American Steamboat Company (CSV), which was suppressed violently, causing the workers to react by setting fire to the company's headquarters.  The Red Week (1905)  In 1905, a spontaneous workers' movement took place in Santiago, encouraged by the anarchists. It came to be known as the Red Week. The movement started as a consequence of an unjustified repression by the police of a rally of protest against taxes on imported meat. The fierce repression and clashes with the police resulted in the deaths of around 200 workers. The indignation of the workers grew stronger and stronger, and most of the labour unions went on general strike. The government declared a state of siege and called upon the army to suppress the movement. The crowds attempted to take over the governmental palace, and even though they did not manage this, the city remained under their control. A march prior to the Santa Mar√≠a School Massacre. The response of the government was to increase the repression and to persecute the revolutionary anarchists and syndicalists who were the leaders of the movement. However, anarchist activity was still on the rise. The anarchist newspaper El Alba condemned the acts in an edition released in October 1905: \\"The people have been assassinated with rage and malice by the young horde of the bourgeoisie. More than 500 citizens have been murdered vilely and cowardly, and more than 1500 were injured\\".  The Santa Mar√≠a School Massacre (1907)  Antonio Ram√≥n Ram√≥n, the \\"avenger\\" of the Santa Mar√≠a School Massacre. In 1906 a general strike was declared in Antofagasta, run by the railroad workers. On 21 December 1907, the strike aimed at improving the pay of the saltpetre miners in Iquique ended in a massacre carried out by the authorities, known as the Santa Mar√≠a School massacre. It was there that the army fired into the crowd that had gathered in Santa Mar√≠a square, killing around 3000 people, among them workers, women, and children.Luis Vitale, Contribuci√≥n a una Historia del Anarquismo en Am√©rica Latina; pg. 30.  First stage: The early years (1880‚Äì1921)  Carlos Pezoa V√©liz. In 1906 a general strike was declared in Antofagasta, run by the railroad workers. On 21 December 1907, the strike aimed at improving the pay of the saltpetre miners in Iquique ended in a massacre carried out by the authorities, known as the Santa Mar√≠a School massacre. It was there that the army fired into the crowd that had gathered in Santa Mar√≠a square, killing around 3000 people, among them workers, women, and children. = The Chilean Workers' Federation (FTCH) (1906) = In June 1906, the general unions of Santiago founded the first national trade union center in the country: The Chilean Workers' Federation (FTCH). The Co-operative Federation of Valpara√≠so was created at the same time, and brought together the benefit societies and the general unions of the nation's main port city. Following the same example, the Co-operative Foundation of Santiago was created in 1907. The FTCH recognised only one organisation per labour union, as a way of avoiding syndicalist parallelism and also as a strategy to weaken the benefit societies, which were seen as reactionary. In 1907, the FTCH supported the general strike, which peaked on 20 June. The Santa Mar√≠a Massacre was the cause of a major repression of labour organisation, which meant that the FTCH and a large part of the other anarchist organisations were dissolved.  Second stage: The splendour of \\"the idea\\" (1921‚Äì1931)  After the Russian Revolution (which was regarded with distrust by most anarchists from the very beginning), the differences between anarchists and Marxists deepened. Their cohabitation within general unions came to an end, and the moderate and reformist socialists took over the Workers' Federation of Chile (FOCH). In December 1919, the Chilean wing of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was founded in Valparaiso. The Chilean IWW differed from the revolutionary workers' organisation in the United States: in Chile, it had clearer anarcho- syndicalist tendencies than in the US, and was more a revolutionary and syndicalist organisation rather than a libertarian one. The IWW had a national reach, from Iquique to Corral. They declared themselves as enemies of the capital, the government, and the church, and their usual tactics were striking, boycotting and sabotaging. It had an enormous influence on the sailors of Valpara√≠so, Iquique and Antofagasta, and it organised the bakers', ammunition manufacturers', builders' and shoemakers' syndicates. Its most famous wobblies (members) were Juan Onofre Chamorro, Armando Trivi√±o, Pedro Ortuzar and Porfirio Soto, among others. = General Unions and Co-operatives vs Benefit Societies = Industrial Workers of the World. The main achievement of the IWW was organising the dispersal of the workers' movement in its confrontation with the capital and the government. However, it could never bring together all the syndicalist and libertarian organisations; in fact, some of them were the rivals of the industrialist organisations, since they preferred organising themselves in unions or branches. The IWW had a strong relationship with the University of Chile Student Federation (FECH), which alerted the government and caused it to increase the repression until 1920. The nationalist organisations, the right-wing crowd and the members of the Patriotic Leagues attacked the workers' and anarchists' establishments, stormed and sacked the FECH, burning the contents of its library in the streets, with the full permission of the police. In spite of the remoteness between the IWW anarcho-syndicalism and the FOCH, (oriented by the communists since 1917), both had as a common enemy the Workers' Association, a pro- fascist employer's association. 5 September 1924 the civic and military coup d'√©tat was repudiated by the Chilean left wing. Nevertheless, the restorative military movement of January 1925 was supported by the socialist and communist forces. The anarchists and the organizations who exercised their influence decided to stay back and not trust the military. In 1925 there was a \\"strike of tenants\\" in Santiago. The government decided to create a \\"Housing Board\\" to solve conflicts between tenants and owners, arrangement that was supported by the communists. The anarcho-syndicalists rejected this arrangement, which they believed had as an objective to divide the strike movement. The anarchists founded that same year a new worker's organization. The Chilean Workers' Regional Federation (known by its abbreviation in Spanish FORCH), affiliated to the International Workers' Association (AIT): taking as a model the Argentinean Regional Worker's Association (FORA). Daniel Barret, El mapa del despertar anarquista latinoamericano In January 1927 a general strike took place in Santiago and Valpara√≠so. A month after general Ib√°√±ez demoted president Arturo Alessandri with a new coup d'√©tat. The 1930s crisis hit the population hard which never stopped striking in the streets. In response, the dictatorship suppressed the worker's organizations and disarticulated them almost completely. A partir de la d√©cada de 1930 comienzan a promulgarse en Chile textos dedicados de manera especial a regular materias sobre la seguridad del Estado y orden p√∫blico, como los siguientes: 1) El DFL N¬∫ 143 de 1931, que estableci√≥ como delito contra la seguridad interior la propagaci√≥n de noticias tendenciosas o falsas. 2) El Decreto Ley N¬∫ 50 de 1932, que regul√≥ una serie de figuras penales que ser√≠an retomadas por los cuerpos normativos posteriores, tales como la apolog√≠a de la violencia, la propagaci√≥n y promoci√≥n de doctrinas subversivas, la incitaci√≥n a la revuelta o al terrorismo, entre otras. 3) La Ley N¬∫ 6026, la primera \\"Ley de Seguridad Interior del Estado\\", promulgada en 1937, cuyas disposiciones ser√≠an recogida por la legislaci√≥n posterior, incluida la Ley de Seguridad Interior actual (que data de 1958). In May 1929 the American Continental Workers' Association (ACAT) was founded in Buenos Aires, to which representatives of the Chilean IWW assisted. By the mid 30s it had its headquarters in Santiago, Chile. However, the organization did not have the significant impact that was expected due to the repression and the advancement of the left wing and the Latin American populist policies, which then led to the disappearance of the ACAT.  Third stage: Modern syndicalism (1931‚Äì1957)  Finalized the dictatorship in 1931, the communists and socialists founded the Worker's Confederation of Chile (CTCH). The anarchists create their own General Worker's Confederation (CGT). However, the legalization of the reformist union and its institutionalized, the harsh repression towards the anarchists and the certain disorganization among the libertarians: weakened the anarchist prevalence, that would start falling during the decade, with a slight upturn during the years of the Spanish Revolution, until becoming of little significance in the 1940s decade. The syndicalist prominence had remained in the hands of the reformist syndicalism of the socialists, communists, and the Christian democrats. In 1947 the anarquist from Cobquecura, Chile, Flora Sanhueza, created the \\"Ateneo Luisa Michel\\" inspired by the libertarian seminars from the beginning of the century. This Seminar was directed to the makers of fishing nets. In the first four years, the seminar worked as a center for development of these workers, practically in undercover. In 1953, it turned into a school that welcomed the children of women workers, dominating itself as \\"Libertarian School Luisa Michel\\". It ended up with more than 70 students. The school stopped functioning in 1957. = The foundation of the Workers' Central Union of Chile (1953) = On 18 June 1950 the central anarchist syndicalist National Unitarian Movement of Workers (MUNT) is created. Formed from the Laborer's Federation of Leather and Footwear Workers (FONACC) and 12 other federations of the anarchist court, in which stood out: the Miners' Federation, the Sweets Federation, the Metallurgist Federation, the Resistance Union of Plasterers (URE), the FONACC, etc. The MUNT had it fixed to have great protagonism in the drafting of the Declaration of Values of the Unique Center of Workers (CUT), founded 12 February 1953 by the Christian syndicalist (libertarian) Clotario Blest. In this Declaration, the Chilean workers pointed out that \\"the emancipation of the workers is the worker's own doing\\" (adopting the motto of the First International).  Fourth stage: The \\"political anarchism\\" (1957‚Äì1973)  In the year 1957 the Libertarian Movement was founded on the seventh of July in remembrance of the general strike carried out in 1955, being its main cheerleader Ernesto Miranda. It grouped anarchists and dispersed syndicalists after its exit that year of the Worker's Central (CUT). In 1958 Law No. 12927 is dictated on \\"Inner Security of the State\\" that, changed in diverse occasions, prevails to the present time, sanctioning any act of insurrectionist nature or revolutionary nature.La \\"Ley sobre Seguridad Interior del Estado\\" se√±ala en su T√≠tulo Segundo que: \\"[‚Ä¶] cometen delito contra la seguridad interior del Estado quienes se alcen contra el Gobierno constituido o provocaren la guerra civil, y especialmente aquellos que inciten a la subversi√≥n del orden p√∫blico o a la revuelta, resistencia o derrocamiento del gobierno constituido, incluyendo a quienes se re√∫nan con tales prop√≥sitos o a fin de conspirar contra la estabilidad del gobierno; los que inciten a las Fuerzas Armadas y/o de Orden y Seguridad, o a individuos pertenecientes a ellas, a la indisciplina, o al desobedecimiento de las √≥rdenes del Gobierno constituido o de sus superiores jer√°rquicos; los que inciten, induzcan, financien o ayuden a la organizaci√≥n de milicias privadas, grupos de combate u otras organizaciones semejantes y a los que formen parte de ellas, con el fin de sustituir a la fuerza p√∫blica, atacarla o interferir en su desempe√±o, o con el objeto de alzarse contra los poderes del Estado o atentar contra las autoridades; los militares o polic√≠as que no cumplieren las √≥rdenes superiores del Gobierno constituido, o retardaren su cumplimiento o procedieren con negligencia culpable; quienes propaguen o fomenten doctrinas que tiendan a destruir o alterar por la violencia el orden social o la forma republicana y democr√°tica de gobierno; y quienes den noticias o informaciones tendenciosas o falsas destinadas a destruir el r√©gimen republicano y democr√°tico de Gobierno, o a perturbar el orden constitucional, la seguridad del pa√≠s, el r√©gimen econ√≥mico o monetario, la normalidad de los precios, la estabilidad de los valores y efectos p√∫blicos y el abastecimiento de las poblaciones.\\" Towards 1961 the anarcho-syndicalists centralized around Ernesto Miranda participated in the formation, next to Clotario Blest, of the \\"Movement of Revolutionary Forces\\" (MFR); a \\"coordinator\\" of groups and individuals representing almost all of the spectrum of the left wing in the 60s. In 1965, Miranda and a group of anarcho-syndicalists, reunited in the ad hoc \\"Libertarian\\" group, participate also next to Blest, of the foundation of the Movement of Revolutionary Left (MIR), retiring soon when Miguel Enr√≠quez and the young people left behind from the Socialist party of Concepci√≥n assumed total control of the organization. In 1972, within the framework of the \\"ascent of the masses\\" in Chile during the Popular Unit (promoted by the left wing), the \\"Libertarian Union Movement\\" (MSL) was created; this was an organization that did not receiving the support of the \\"Front of Revolutionary Workers\\" (of the MIR), so it registered a list on its own to the general elections of the CUT, taking Ernesto Miranda as candidate for president, who obtained as little as 0.35% of the voting. After losing the election of the CUT, Miranda was strongly criticized for proposing the foundation of a \\"libertarian political party\\". In the decade of 1970 there were some sporadic appearances of libertarian groups during the government of Salvador Allende. At the beginning of 1973 the Libertarian Federation of Chile (FLCH) is born after the meeting of old militants and young people disillusioned of the MIR. This federation, although of very short existence, would become famous after writing up a proclamation where they announced the imminence of a coup d'√©tat and the incapacity of the government of Popular Unity in order to confront it.  Fifth stage: The Lost Years (1973‚Äì1990)  After the coup d'√©tat of general Augusto Pinochet, a cruel repressive wave triggered against all the left wing, including the little individual anarchists who still existed. In 1975 the Committee of Defense of Human rights (CODEH) is reactivated, by Clotario Blest and Ernesto Miranda, that will be of vital importance for the persecuted by the dictatorship. The anarchist affiliation during the dictatorship did not have an organic character, limiting itself to the work of some individuals that contributed to the formation of resistance groups against the dictatorship, specially in the university and population scope. Anarchism ‚Äì as a social movement was forgotten during those years. Luis Vitale, Contribuci√≥n a una Historia del Anarquismo en Am√©rica Latina; pg. 35  Anarchism in Chile nowadays   Anarchism makes a comeback in Concepci√≥n  Between 1992 and 1995, a strong libertarian presence is observed in sectors of Concepci√≥n, in the street struggle and the protest activities of the University of Concepci√≥n; especially during the day of the young combatant. In 1990 the \\"Collective Anarchist\\" of Concepci√≥n is formed, which gathers members of the \\"Factory of Union and Social Analysis\\" and the \\"Collective Liberation\\". The Collective is shown to the community in the act of 1 May 1990, with a noticeably anarchist poster. From this experience, and after the entrance of several individuals, the first Anarchist Congress in 1991 takes shape. Soon the \\"Kolektivo Kultural Mano Negra\\" is formed and will originate in the \\"Kolektivo Kultural Malatesta\\", that in 1995 will be the basis of the \\"Germinal Audio-visual Collective\\", origin of the \\"Anarchist Germinal Group\\". Precisely, within the oldest groups and of anarcho-syndicalist tendency, we can mention the \\"Worker's Solidarity\\" of Concepci√≥n, tied to the AIT, and to the \\"Germinal Anarchist Group\\" of Penco, which develops propaganda work pro- IFA. This group went from being a group of audio-visual diffusion, soon happened to define itself in 1995 by the tendency of 'especifista', strengthening the work of insertion in cultural spaces like; Boca Sur, Lomas Coloradas and Chiguayante, to soon found a library and a center of documentation in Penco. At present the \\"Cultural Center Claudia Lopez\\" (named in memory of the anarchist student assassinated in 1998) is to be found in Concepci√≥n. Within the framework of the strike of the miners of Lota of 1996, a call to the conformation of a \\"Committee of Solidarity\\" with the miners takes place. In that space, next to union sectors and Marxist groups, the libertarian presence becomes present in the three months that the struggle lasted. Although the anarchist revival in the 90s seems to come from the Platformism current, near the political left wing (with influences of the MIR and FPMR), that rescues the \\"political anarchism\\" of the Libertarian Movement of 7 July and that is manifested by the end of the '80s in the \\"Man and Society Training Center\\", [direct antecedent of the \\"Anarco Communist Congress of Unification\\" (CUAC) and of the \\"Libertarian Communist Organization\\" (OCL- Chile)]; with the foundation in 2002 of the Front of Libertarian Students (FEL) and of the participation in the Presidency of the Republic political campaign of Marcel Claude (through the \\"Libertarian Network\\"), this current moves away more and more of the anarchism to constitute itself in a political party of left wing. Towards the mid '90s, product of the approach to libertarian theses of some militants of the \\"Youth Lautaro Movement\\" (MJL- Lautaro) (Marxism‚ÄìLeninism-maoism), begin to develop an insurreccionalist trend similar to libertarian marxism and situacionism. Towards mid 2000s, this current starts spreading through the \\"Kolektivo Kamina Libre\\" and de las casas okupa. Although it is certain that their theses contribute a new air to the traditional anarchism, it is not less certain that their avant-garde practices situate them closer to Marxism‚ÄìLeninism.  \\"The idea\\" expands throughout Chile  Anarchist march in Valpara√≠so, 2005. During the 2000s a rebirth of \\"the idea\\" arose again; this time around the Anarchist Blok, an organization composed by different groups based in Santiago, such as: \\"Current Anarchist Revolution\\" (CRA) (the longest standing group; active since 2003), the newspaper \\"Ide√°crata\\", \\"Direct Action Editions\\" or \\"Santiago's Society for Resistance\\". During those years \\"Anarchist May Day\\" and \\"Libertarian May, the first\\" celebrations were held in remembrance of the Haymarket affair. Noam Chomsky, member of the American IWW; and Eduardo Colombo of the French CNT -and author of L'espace politique de l'anarchie-, visited the country during 2006 as they were invited by the Institute of Anarchist Studies (IEA). Noam Chomsky. The libertarian groups \\"GOKE\\" and \\"Neither Helmet Nor Uniform\\" lead the opposition to compulsory military service through conscientious objection since the early 1990s; becoming, thus, a referent for Chilean antimilitarism. It is also worth noting the healthy state of the squatting movement, which has refurbished different cultural and social venues re-opening them for community use. In the city of Santiago alone there are several squat houses like \\"El Ateneo\\", \\"La Tortuga\\", \\"Volnitza\\" and \\"La M√°quina\\" in the Recoleta Commune. Born in the squatter spaces of the cities of Valparaiso, Villa Alemana and Quilpu√©, the informal group \\"Black Column\\" has become a center of gravity for many people committed to tasks of agitation, urban intervention, hacking, and media activism. They claim to be inspired by their particular interpretation of Situationism, their own update to Autonomism, biopolitical criticism and Queer Theory; they do not belong to an organization as such, although they function within a rhizome-like structure. This situation has made Anarchists from Valparaiso to be sometimes perceived as different to many others in the rest of Chile and elsewhere. From the beginning of the 1990s the Eco-anarchist tendency started to be expressed in Chile in an incipient way when the works of Murray Bookchin began to be widespread. Nowadays, the \\"Eco-anarchist Group\\" (GEA) from Santiago -which advocates Social Ecology ‚Äì and some other groups linked to organic community farming, permaculture and vegetarianism stand out. During the 2006 student protests in Chile, young anarchist students at the University of Art and Social Sciences, for the first time in almost half a century, raised their banner in a struggle against education profiteering and for universal gratuity in the education system, beginning thus a campaign that would expand into the following decade and was, in fact, supported massively by the rest of the Chilean students. During the student protests in Chile in 2008 and 2011, libertarians had a significant presence within the assemblies of high school and university students, forcing the reformist sectors (communists and socialists mainly) to maintain the debate regarding universal gratuity. The communist project, up to that point, was oriented towards obtaining a system of \\"differentiated fee\\". In the year 2012 the \\"First Anarchist Book Fair in Santiago\\" took place; and it was organized again in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  New publications  In recent years anarchist propaganda and media publications have multiplied, carrying out an increasingly intensive task of propagating anarchist ideas and libertarian practices in the country as well as developing its project in the social movements and organizations. These publications also give evidence of the differences among the anarchists themselves, since many groups adhere to different but not necessarily contradictory tendencies. There are spaces dedicated to journalism from a libertarian point of view such as: Hommodolars, a website belonging to the Autonomous Collective for Counter-Information Hommodolars, and the newspaper Ojo Subterr√°neo. At the beginning of the decade of 2000 the fanzine Ide√°crata, the voice of the Chilean 'anarko-punk' began to be published. During 2006‚Äì2007, the journal Acci√≥n Directa made its appearance. From 2009 to 2013 El Surco started to be published, with a circulation of 2000 copies, distributed throughout the country and abroad. Since June 2010, the Anarco-Communist newspaper Solidaridad can be found in the most populated cities of Chile. Since the end of 2011 the monthly newspaper El Amanecer began to be published in Chill√°n, with a circulation of 600 copies and presence in other parts of Chile. This publication's aim was to deal with dystopian issues such as Schizoanalysis or Anti-psychiatry. Also, from 2011 the newspaper Acracia is still being published monthly in Valdivia. Since 2014 this publication has become the mouthpiece for FALV. Also, the publication of the anarchist newspaper El Sol √Åcrata began in northern Chile during 2012, with presence in Calama and Antofagasta. There are also some publications linked to the countercultural movement; Desobediencia Publishers, the DSOBDC Editions and the fanzine Akci√≥n Direkta, among many others. As for the audiovisual media, it is worth noting the work carried out by the Productora de Comunicaci√≥n Social, which produces the videomagazine Sinapsis, a DVD launched in 2007 and renown by its documentaries. Although its periodicity is somewhat irregular and there is no clear estimate of the number of copies being distributed, the material being published has been copied intensively by different kinds of collectives. Ediciones Esp√≠ritu Libertario is a publishing house focusing on the distribution of books, it was founded in the middle of 2001 and is a local referent for the self-management of books manufacturing. In the mid-1990s they published Historia de la subversi√≥n olvidada written by Chilean Libertarian historian √ìscar Ortiz. There are also other publishing houses relying on artisan work such as Ediciones Crimental, Afila tus Ideas, and Pu√±ales con Tinta. They have joined efforts, alongside other small publishers, to create The Coordinating Centre of Black Editorials, which has participated in numerous instances within the students movement that has been developed at the same time.  The Criminalization of the Anarchist Movement  Educating and profiting = Governing and stealing. Graffiti in Ancud of 2011. In recent years, hundreds of anarchists have been arrested and prison sentences have been served by individuals who were accused of street disorder, ill-treatment of police officers and the placement of bombs, which has led the anarchist movement to be criminalized. One of the first victims in the clashes with the police after the return to democracy was anarchist dance student Claudia L√≥pez Benaiges, who died due to the action of the state security forces during the disturbances of 11 September 1998. Today there is an Anarchist Social Center in the city of Penco that bears her name. On 28 January 2006, a bomb was detonated at the entrance of the offices of the National Intelligence Agency of Chile (ANI) in Tenderini Street in the city of Santiago. A group called Autonomous and Destructive Forces Leon Czolgosz took responsibility for this action. On 31 March 2008 young anarchist Jhonny Cariqueo Y√°nez died as a result of the beating suffered on 29 March (Young Combatant's Day) while he was under arrest by the Carabineros de Chile in Santiago. La Naci√≥n ‚Äì Involucran a Carabinero en muerte de otro poblador. 2 de abril de 2008 On 14 December of that same year, another Anarchist and supporter of the Mapuche cause, Juan \\"Orangu\\" Cruz Magna, 28, from Santiago, was shot in the neck by strangers when he was spending some time at the Mapuche community of Temucuicui. Kaos en la Red ‚Äì Medios acusan a la comunidad Temucuicui de haber asesinado a Juan Cruz Makna On 22 May 2009, Anarchist Mauricio Morales died in Santiago Centro when the bomb that he was carrying at his back went off near the Gendarmerie School. La Naci√≥n ‚Äì Anarquista muri√≥ al estallarle bomba que llevaba en mochila. 23 de mayo de 2009 On 31 December 2009, Basque novelist Asel Luzarraga was arrested in Padre Las Casas, accused of being involved in the placement of four explosive devices. That accusation was finally withdrawn in the face of manifest material impossibility, as it was shown that Asel was outside Chile on the dates of three of those four attacks. In 2013 he published with the publishing house Quimant√∫: Los buenos no usan paraguas (Desmontando un montaje; desnudando al Estado), an essay that narrates the judicial process in which he was involved. On 14 August 2010, in the so-called \\"Bombs Case\\", the squatter house Sacco y Vanzetti was raided and 14 people were arrested, including anarchists, anti-authoritarians and Marxists. After eight months in prison and several months of probation, all of those charged were declared innocent after a long trial that culminated in the Chilean Supreme Court. In October 2012, an appeal was rejected that sought to annul the ruling that acquitted the accused. In 2012, young Anarchist Luciano Pitronello was sentenced to six years of probation. The process had begun with him being arrested under charges of terrorism for installing a bomb at a bank of Santander branch, and ended with him being charged for handling of explosives and the use a false patent. In November 2013 some young anarchists acquitted in the \\"Bombs Case\\" were arrested in Spain accused of installing explosive devices at Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar injuring a woman.http://www.abc.es/local-aragon/20131114/abci-anarquista-detenido- atentar- pilar-201311140830.htmlhttp://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/detenidos- barcelona-cuatro-radicales-acusados-bomba- pilar-2834069http://www.biobiochile.cl/2013/11/13/policia-espanola-detiene-a- chilenos-acusados-de-atentados-explosivos-en-basilica-del- pilar.shtmlhttp://www.rpp.com.pe/2014-07-04-espana-procesan-por-terrorismo-a- dos-chilenos-por-colocar-una-bomba- noticia_705305.htmlhttp://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1975055/0/detenidos/barcelona/atentado- el-pilar/http://www.diariovasco.com/rc/20131117/mas- actualidad/sociedad/detenidos-atentar-basilica-pilar-201311172226.html They were found guilty of \\"Terrorist damages\\"and\\" terrorist injuries\\" and sentenced to 12 years in prison.http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2016/03/680-674560-9-justicia- espanola-condena-a-12-anos-a-anarquistas-chilenos-que-atentaron-en.shtml At least 200 artifacts have exploded in Chile since 2005. This has led to the formulation of charges against some thirty anarchists.

Since the beginning of the nineteenth century there have been a significant number of literati who adhered to the anarchist cause. Among these we can mention V√≠ctor Domingo Silva, Antonio B√≥rquez Solar, Carlos Pezoa V√©liz, Carlos Roberto Mondaca Cort√©s, Alfredo Guillermo Bravo, Jos√© Domingo G√≥mez Rojas, and the National Literature Prizes: Jos√© Santos Gonz√°lez Vera, author of Vidas M√≠nimas, and Manuel Rojas, a renowned novelist, author of Hijo de un Ladr√≥n. Jos√© Domingo G√≥mez Rojas (1896‚Äì1920) Luis Olea, Magno Espinoza, Alejandro Escobar and Carballo, Marcial Cabrera Guerra, and Eduardo GentosoCappelletti, op.cit. p√°g. combined their Anarchist journalistic activity and union activism with literature and poetry, which were considered as another means of spreading Anarchist ideals. The most renown of them was Carlos Pezoa V√©liz, poet, translator, lecturer, journalist and lyricist of songs. There were also novelists who supported Tolstoy's ideas such as Pedro Prado, author of La Reina de Rapa Nui and La Casa Abandonada, and Fernando Santiv√°n, who published his autobiographical work Memorias de un Tolstoiano. In the first decades of the 21st century, \\"The Idea\\" has resurfaced through new and diverse musical tendencies, such as punk, hip-hop, trova and electronic music. A stream of post-punk graphic design that has permeated the entire society with its Anarchist slogans has also emerged in the last years.

Unsworth, a 13-year-old boy, committed suicide after years of bullying motivated by his homosexuality. His death garnered considerable national attention in Australia, as well as international attention. Unsworth's suicide was particularly controversial because it took place in the context of a number of vigorous debates in Australia about LGBTI issues, notably same-sex marriage and LGBTI-specific anti-bullying programs in schools. Throughout 2016, there had been significant controversy over one such program: the Safe Schools Coalition Australia, of which the federal government had curtailed the operation. Unsworth's death renewed criticism of that decision, and was cited as evidence that the program was needed. There are ongoing criminal proceedings regarding some of the bullying Unsworth faced from his school peers.  Background  = Political context =  Safe Schools Coalition Australia  In February 2016, the Safe Schools Coalition Australia, an initiative designed to combat anti-LGBTI prejudice in schools, became the center of significant political and social debate. It was criticized by conservatives prominent in both media and politics, who contended that the program was more about enforcing a radical view of sexuality and gender on school children than its stated goals. It was also criticized by socially conservative activists such as the Australian Christian Lobby, who objected to its affirmation of homosexuality and its opposition to homophobia. On February 23, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that the program would be reviewed, a move heavily criticized by LGBTI advocates and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. On March 11, the review was given to the government, and it was made public on March 16. The review largely vindicated the program, angering conservative MPs. 43 Coalition MPs signed a petition calling for the program to be suspended. On March 18, the federal government announced that the program would be significantly curtailed. Its response went beyond that recommended by the review, which led to further criticism by LGBTI advocates. The program continued to be the subject of controversy throughout the year. LGBTI advocates have expressed concerns that the ongoing controversy had caused an increase in anti-LGBTI school bullying.  Proposed plebiscite on same-sex marriage  On August 11, 2015, after a party room meeting of both the Liberal and National parties, the Coalition government decided that while they would continue to vote as a block against same-sex marriage for the term of Parliament of the time, it would hold a plebiscite on same-sex marriage after the next election. The proposal was almost unanimously rejected by the LGBTI community in Australia; one survey returned 85% opposition to a plebiscite among the LGBTI community. Opinion polls at the time showed a strong majority of Australians in favour of the proposal; however, some LGBTI advocates have contended that this support was not due to in-principle support for a plebiscite, but rather the loss of faith in the Parliament to legislate, and a belief that a plebiscite was necessary to legalise same-sex marriage. After taking over the leadership of the Liberal Party and Prime Ministership in September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull pledged to continue the government's support for a plebiscite. An attempt at a conscience vote on same-sex marriage was blocked by the government on March 2, 2016. One argument against the plebiscite offered by its opponents is that it would have a negative impact on the mental health of LGBTI people. On October 22, 2015, during Parliament's Question Time, Shorten asked Turnbull about his support for the plebiscite, citing a submission from Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria opposing the plebiscite on mental health grounds. Turnbull responded that the debate would be respectful. The Coalition campaigned on the plebiscite at the 2016 election, pledging to hold it if re-elected. Labor pledged a parliamentary vote on same-sex marriage if it was elected, with Shorten citing the Orlando nightclub shooting as highlighting the possible dangers of a plebiscite. His comment was criticized by opponents of same-sex marriage. The Coalition was re-elected at the July 2 election with a one-seat majority, and continued planning for the plebiscite. However, in July 2016, opinion polls began to show decreasing support for the proposal. One poll found initial support for a plebiscite to be 48%, but that when voters were aware that Coalition MPs would not be required to vote for same-sex marriage if it was passed, support dropped to 35%, and when voters were aware that it would cost $160 million, support fell to 25%. On September 12, 2016, Shorten spoke in Parliament against a plebiscite. He again invoked mental health, but also suicide, commenting: > Every piece of expert advice tells us young Australians who are gay are more > likely to contemplate suicide and more likely to take their own lives. The > idea of young people, perhaps yet to come out, seeing the legitimacy of > their identity debated on the national stage. That is not an ideal inflicted > on any citizen when we have a better path. Let me be as blunt as possible: a > 'no' campaign would be an emotional torment for gay teenagers, and if one > child commits suicide over the plebiscite, then that is one too many. This comment was strongly criticised by conservative commentators, who labelled it \\"emotional blackmail\\". However, on October 4, 2016, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that mental health service Lifeline had added \\"2016 Marriage Equality Plebiscite\\" to a list of reasons that people seek its services, in anticipation of increased demand of its services should the plebiscite go ahead. The bill for the plebiscite was introduced to the Parliament on September 14, 2016. On October 11, the Labor caucus unanimously decided to bind against it. With Labor's numbers against it in the Senate, passage of the plebiscite bill was widely considered impossible. It passed the House on October 20, but was voted down by the Senate on November 7. (However, after Unsworth's death, a popular vote on same-sex marriage did take place in the form of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey.) LGBTI advocates have repeatedly criticised the debate about marriage equality in Australia as vitriolic, and have argued that homophobia generated by the debate and the plebiscite contributed to Unsworth's suicide. Some have further argued that his suicide vindicates criticism of the plebiscite on the grounds it would make LGBTI suicides more likely. = Unsworth's personal life = Unsworth attended Aspley State High School in Brisbane, Australia. His mother reported that he was gay and that he had been consistently bullied over his sexuality for years, telling the Courier-Mail: > \\"He was a really feminine male, he loved fashion, he loved make-up and the > boys always picked on him, calling him gay-boy, faggot, fairy; it was a > constant thing from Year Five.\\" Unsworth was Indigenous.  Violent assault  On October 27, 2016, Unsworth was the victim of a violent assault, in which he was struck in the jaw with a fence pole. His aunt has reported that the assault occurred during an argument over a girl between Unsworth and another boy, narrating the argument as follows: > \\"Someone spat on a girl so Tyrone defended the girl. The other fellow who > was in the argument went and found a fence paling and while Tyrone had his > back turned hit him with it.\\" The assault took place outside the Police Citizens Youth Club in Zillmere in north Brisbane. Students at his school witnessed the assault and took him into the club. Staff at the club called an ambulance. Unsworth's injuries required surgery, and he was afraid to return to school following the assault. Unsworth's grandmother has reported that \\"We tried to force him [to return to school] but he just kept saying, 'No, I don't want to go back to school.'\\" Following the assault, Unsworth moved to his grandfather's property in Upper Kedron in north west Brisbane to recover. His aunt has said that \\"He was very different when he got out of hospital\\". Her and his grandfather told Unsworth after almost a month's absence from school that he would have to return to school, a prospect the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has reported \\"weighed heavily on Tyrone's mind.\\"  Last day  A friend of Unsworth has reported that the day before he committed suicide, he was on a fishing trip with her and revealed the extent of the bullying he was facing. Unsworth's friend told the ABC's 7.30 program: > \\"He was an absolute mess, crying his eyes out and telling me everyone wants > him dead and I said, 'Tyrone, what do you mean everyone wants you dead?' He > said, 'The kids at school keep telling me to go kill myself', and I was > obviously gobsmacked. [The other students] did call him nasty names, like > faggot and fairy. He loved girly things, he's chosen dresses for me and his > mum to wear, he's asked to use makeup. Kids obviously thought because he's > like that he could be a target for their bullying.\\" She urged Unsworth to tell someone at his school about the bullying, but that Unsworth replied \\"They don't care\\", and that he was not wanted and didn't belong at the school. = Actions of Aspley State High School = There have been conflicting reports about whether or not Unsworth's school was aware of his bullying and the actions it took. The school has acknowledged knowing about the assault on Unsworth on October 27 but not about other bullying. Unsworth's family has disputed this. Following Unsworth's suicide, principal Jacquinta Miller said that no allegation had been made about bullying of Unsworth to the school but that the school would have intervened had there been. Queensland's Department of Education has stated: \\"Tyrone was absent from school following the [assault] incident and the school attempted to make contact with the family regularly. The school has the best interests of the family and school community at heart in handling this matter.\\"  Death  Unsworth committed suicide on November 22, 2016. His grandfather had planned that he would be at school on this day, but he remained at his grandfather's farm. His grandfather returned to the farm from work at about 1 p.m. When he did not find Unsworth in the house, he \\"walked out the back\\" and found him dead.  Reactions  Unsworth's suicide generated significant attention in Australia, as well as international attention. = Unsworth's family = Unsworth's mother wrote on Facebook that she \\"just wanted him to wake up and come home with me.\\" She also said that Unsworth was \\"pain free now\\" and that his bullies \\"can't pick on you anymore, but this shouldn't of had to happen. No words can explain how we are feeling for you and what has happened.\\"[sic] Unsworth's grandmother wrote: > \\"Now you're at ease and peaceful, lay to rest my beautiful grandson, you be > flying high with the butterflies and your fairy angels will be guarding you > way up in the sky our darling little grandson.\\" = School community = Aspley State High School principal Jacquinta Miller said in a statement that \\"no allegation of bullying against this young person was made to our school. Neither the student nor his family ever came to us to say there was a problem of any kind. If they did, we absolutely would have stepped in.\\" She also said that Unsworth's family had the school's \\"deepest sympathies\\" and that \\"the safety and wellbeing of everyone in our school is our highest priority and we do not tolerate bullying in any way, shape or form.\\" A parent of children at Aspley State High petitioned the school to join the Safe Schools Coalition. The petition quickly garnered 20,000 signatures. = Australian community = Vigils were held in various locations around Australia in honour of Unsworth. On December 4, a rally in Unsworth's memory attended by hundreds of people was held in Brisbane. Attendees were asked to dress in bright colours. Speakers and attendees demanded implementation of the Safe Schools program in Queensland schools, with some speakers sharing stories of other LGBTI young people suffering bullying, poor mental health, and in one case, suicide. On December 5, the ABC featured a report on Unsworth's life, suicide and the issues of homophobia and bullying in Australia on its 7.30 program. = LGBTI community = Australia's LGBTI community reacted with shock and grief to Unsworth's suicide, and called for more to be done about anti-LGBTI bullying. The Safe Schools Coalition released a statement saying it was \\"grieving the loss of a precious young life and express our deepest sympathies to the family and friends effected and ask that the public respect their right to privacy.\\" The New South Wales Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby said that Unsworth's suicide was \\"why we need Safe Schools\\", and \\"Our thoughts are with his devastated family.\\" Micah Scott, the head of Australian LGBTI youth group Minus18, said that \\"Tyrone's experience isn't an isolated incident. It is shared by LGBTI young people around Australia. I think that is really important to highlight.\\" He criticized what he deemed to be \\"fearmongering and false information\\" about the Safe Schools Coalition, which he said was making the program harder to implement. LGBTI advocate Rodney Croome commented: > \\"Being a teenager is hard enough, but being a gay teenager is that much > harder because of the stigma, bullying and fear of not fitting in. (LGBTIQ > youth suicide rates are) a national disgrace and it requires a national > response, starting with training for all teachers in how to recognise and > respond to the kind of homophobic bullying that took Tyrone Unsworth's > life.\\" = Political responses = Australian MP for Goldstein Tim Wilson used a 90-second parliamentary speech to pay tribute to Unsworth. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten called Unsworth's suicide \\"heartbreaking\\", described him as a \\"brave young man\\", and stated that \\"The importance of Safe Schools has never been clearer to me.\\" Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek described the news as \\"absolutely heartbreaking\\" and that \\"Labor's thoughts are with Tyrone's lived ones.\\" Senior Labor Senator Penny Wong said that \\"This is a tragic event and my heart goes out to Tyrone's family. This why anti-bullying programs matter and why we need to defend the Safe Schools program.\\" MP for Herbert Cathy O'Toole called for the Safe Schools program to be further implemented. Queensland Education Minister Kate Jones stated that \\"the heartbreaking story here is that we know young people who identify as LGBTI are more likely to commit suicide. We have to do more to support all young people to feel safe and supported. We have to work towards a day when we see an end to bullying and discrimination.\\" = Response from social conservatives = The Australian Family Association called the news of Unsworth's suicide \\"horrible\\", while reiterating that the Safe Schools Coalition was \\"not about bullying.\\" The Australian Marriage Forum described the news as \\"terrible\\", a \\"tragedy\\" and a situation of \\"inconsolable sadness\\". They said that Unsworth had been \\"cruelly teased\\" and \\"everyone has been shaken\\" by his suicide. It maintained that his suicide was not a justification for implementing the Safe Schools program. The Australian Christian Lobby and Marriage Alliance, another anti-same-sex marriage group, did not comment on Unsworth's suicide, according to same-sex marriage advocacy group Equal Marriage Rights Australia. EMRA criticised their lack of comment. Fake social media accounts were set up in Unsworth's name, with the operator of one account saying that their \\"issue\\" with Unsworth is \\"he is a fag\\". Rodney Croome stated that Unsworth was \\"being bullied beyond the grave\\" and that the operation of fake accounts \\"highlights how deep the hatred of LGBTI people still runs in some parts of Australian society.\\" = Criticism of social conservatives = Unsworth's suicide sparked fierce criticism of conservative activists who had campaigned against LGBTI anti-bullying initiatives such as the Safe Schools Coalition. LGBTI rights activist Simon Hunt argued that \\"The Australian Christian Lobby and The Australian are culpable in Tyrone's death because of their relentless, dishonest campaign against #SafeSchools.\\" Lobbying group Secular Public Education severely criticised the Australian Christian Lobby, calling it \\"viciously homophobic\\" and accusing it of \\"intense hate-campaigning\\", \\"malicious actions and bullying tactics\\". SPE alleged that the controversy over Safe Schools had been \\"entirely fabricated\\" by the ACL, which was \\"relentlessly assisted\\" by News Limited, and that as a result of their campaigning, \\"Queensland schools running the program are subjected to a constant stream of abusive correspondence, emails and phone calls.\\" Equal Marriage Rights Australia asserted that the Australian Christian Lobby and other conservative activists had \\"so much blood on its hands\\" due to Unsworth's suicide. Daily Telegraph contributor Shannon Molloy wrote that \\"there are a lot of people with the innocent blood of a 13-year-old boy on their hands this week\\" and wondered \\"if they're happy about it.\\" He accused some conservative activists of \\"devoting significant portions of their lives to attacking, persecuting, degrading and seeking the continued marginalisation of gay, lesbian and transgender people\\" and said he \\"wouldn't be surprised if inside their cold, dead hearts there's a rare and excited beat\\" over Unsworth's death. Contributor for The Guardian Nic Holas wrote that anger over the death \\"is best directed\\" towards \\"architects\\" of the campaign against the Safe Schools Coalition. He identified those architects as \\"the editors and staff of conservative newspapers; the rightwing politicians like Queensland's own George Christensen, who continues to attack any and every aspect of the Safe Schools program and had the temerity to gloat after he successfully \\"gutted\\" the anti-bullying program; the Australian Christian Lobby who target LGBTIQA children and illegally use their images to spread a deceitful campaign.\\" Holas attributed Unsworth's bullying to \\"a culture of conservatism gone mad.\\" Fairfax Media writer John Birmingham wrote that Unsworth's suicide was an example of \\"the real-world consequences of the cruel games played by politicians like George Christensen and Cory Bernardi, and the cowardice of Malcolm Turnbull\\". He accused the trio of believing it to be \\"so important [Unsworth] and every child like him be made to feel like hunted freaks.\\" Fellow Fairfax writer Tim Dick condemned \\"grown-up bullies, those adults who attack, smear, vilify the people who drew up an optional educational tool to reduce the amount of hate people have to face.\\" The Labor politician Cathy O'Toole said that the federal government had made \\"incredibly cruel and divisive remarks\\" about the program. Courier Mail contributor Lauren Martyn- Jones wrote that \\"Tyrone Unsworth is just the sort of kid the Safe Schools program was established to support, before it became mired in controversy and ended up as a whipping post for the right-wing, anti-PC brigade.\\" The Salvation Army was criticised for issuing a statement shortly after Unsworth's death saying that it would not support the Safe Schools Coalition in its current form. Michael Barnett, co-convenor of Jewish LGBTI group Aleph, commented that \\"News Corp journalists like Andrew Bolt, Miranda Devine and Rita Panahi are on a crusade to destroy transgender kids\\", a claim strongly denied and criticised by Bolt.  Memorial  Unsworth's funeral was on December 1, 2016. Over $20,000 was raised by his family to cover the costs of the funeral.  Aftermath  = Criminal proceedings = The assault on Unsworth was investigated by Queensland Police. On February 3, 2017, the police force concluded their investigation and said in a statement that Unsworth's assailant, also a 13-year-old boy, was \\"being dealt with under the provisions of the Youth Justice Act\\". = Future of the Safe Schools Coalition = Federal government funding for the Safe Schools Coalition was set to expire on June 30, 2017. In order for the program to continue operation after this date, it would be necessary for it to be funded by states. Australian states have taken different approaches to funding of the program. On April 16, 2017, New South Wales Education Minister Rob Stokes announced that New South Wales would not fund the program beyond June 30, 2017, and that it would be replaced by a different anti-bullying initiative. This move was heavily criticised by Fairfax columnist Andrew Street, who invoked Unsworth's suicide in his criticism. On April 18, 2017, Tasmanian Education Minister Jeremy Rockliff announced that, like New South Wales, Tasmania would also not fund the program beyond June 30, 2017, and would instead implement a different anti-bullying initiative. The new initiative would preserve a focus on anti- LGBTI bullying. The Australian Christian Lobby criticised the new program as well, arguing that there should be no focus on sexuality and gender in anti- bullying programs.

It is managed and operated by Seogwipo city government. The museum displays items related to the history and culture of citrus and the citrus industry. History and location The museum opened on February 25, 2005 in the Sinhyo-dong district of Seogwipo City, at the foot of Wollabong Peak. Located on a sprawling hillside, the facilities include the museum, an artificial waterfall, a citrus experiential learning field, a farming recreation complex and an agricultural product distribution center. The specific goal was described by the museum's manager, Hyun-gwan Cheol in 2011, \\"We need to tell people about the value of citrus. We need to save [its] history\\". The museum is an affiliate of the citrus industry in Jeju Island along with the Citrus Research Station, the Climate Change Research Center and South Korea‚Äôs National Gardening & Herbal Medicine Research Institute. It is recognized by citrus researchers as a source of information for the history and development of the citrus industry in South Korea, as well as citrus- related technologies, products and entertainments. In 2015, The Korea Times reported that Jeju produces most of the citrus fruit consumed domestically in Korea with a total of 3,600 tons of fruit exported in 2014; 1,500 tons going to Britain, and 722 tons going to Canada. Some of the local fruits are the gamgyul, which is grown in open fields; hallabong, created especially for Jeju, and cheonhaehyang, both grown in greenhouses; and unshu, grown in fields and greenhouses. Generations of rural families supported themselves and their children's education with the industry, especially from the 1970s to the 1990s. Dropping prices in 2002 caused the farmers to diversify, some branching into the tourism industry with \\"experience programs\\", where visitors picked their own fruit. The government provided the farmers subsidies to help stabilize prices, with gamgyul picking retaining its important role in the island's culture and economy. Juju has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and the Korea Tourism Organization named the museum as one of eighteen named \\"special tourist zones\\" of Jeju Island. Artificial waterfall by orchard. Citrus museum buggy ride. Facilities The facilities consist of areas both inside and outside the museum: a themed exhibition hall, 3D image room and seminar room, folk relic exhibition hall, special exhibition hall, world citrus orchard, and a subtropical botanical garden Inside the museum there is an interactive learning exhibition, an arcade of 3D videos, interactive maps, sniffing stations, insect galleries, citrus products from all over the world and an observatory. The first exhibition room provides a history of types of citrus fruits, cultivation methods, and country of origin. The second exhibition room explains the trend of the citrus industry and the processing industry such as citrus juice. The exhibition room of folk relics shows Jeju's ancestral farming and household goods. Sarah Warren, a journalist for The Jeju Weekly, noted one item of interest in the exhibit, the dottongsi, a traditional Jeju toilet. And, the Citrus Virtual Experience Room gives a view of real citrus farming. The exhibits show a glimpse of Jeju residents' lives. The world citrus exhibition is located in the greenhouses at the back of the museum and staff call it a \\"secret garden\\" and a favorite of visitors, with over 100 kinds of citrus fruit, including the largest and smallest, and unusual ones like the Buddha's hand. It is divided into sections, including the Asian Pavilion, the Japanese Pavilion, the American Pavilion, the European Pavilion, and the Korean Pavilion; some of the subtropical plants are mango, papaya and guava. Outside is the picking orchard, artificial waterfalls, walking trail, playground and small workout facility. International citrus exposition Since 2013, it has participated as joint host for the annual Seogwipo World Citrus Pre-Expo (and later Expos), always held in November, with local government and industry affiliates. Some of these include: Agriculture, Livestock and Livestock Foods Department, Rural Development Administration, National Agricultural Products Quality Management Institute, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province Development Corporation, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province Tourism Association, Jeju Tourism Organization, KOTRA, Jeju Chamber of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, and NACF. The 2013 pre-exo was themed \\"The Future of Seogwipo and its Globally Renowned Citrus\\", and provided visitors a chance to compare Jeju's local citrus with citrus from eight other countries, including the United States, France, China and Japan.In 2015, the first expo, Jeju International Citrus Expo 2015, with some 174,000 visitors, discussed \\"The Future of Jeju, the Worldwide Prestigious Citrus\\" with the goal of raising the competitiveness of the Korean orange industry globally and providing more export opportunities for local varieties like the gamgyul. View from grounds towards ocean. Events and programs The museum and facilities offer monthly hands-on programs, such as making cookies, cakes, mandarin candles and soaps. One example was the July 25th, 2015 \\"Citrus and Jelly Making\\" program with 17 teams and 73 participants, followed by \\"Tangerine Muffin Making\\" in August. Depending on the season, visitors can pick citrus fruit and sample either the citrus or the edible citrus blossoms. Some more organized events are tree propagation, tie-dying with tangerine peels and the art of citrus tea making. In addition to cooking and making citrus items, the well-being experience program includes a footbath experience site. In December 2014, Seogwipo city promoted the museum with other nearby sightseeing places including Cheonjiyeon Falls, Jeongbang Falls, Mt. Sanbangsan and the Yongmeori Coast after a decrease in visitors following the Sinking of MV Sewol's effect on school excursions traveling from the mainland to Jeju. The museum holds special art exhibits, in addition to its main collections. In December 2012 through January 2013, the work of Koh Jae Man, \\"famous mandarins\\" as symbols of the island, was shown. And artist Do-Hee Jeon \\"2015 Botanical Art Exhibition\\" was shown at the museum In 2016, they held a citrus floral fragrance children's literary contest winner exhibition.

The manuscript is described as illustrated encyclopedia about ancient Indian astrology and astral magic. The book consists of 876 miniature paintings and about 400 paintings of various angels, planets, signs, degrees, Sufic talismans, magical spells, Hindu goddesses, astrological tables and horoscopes, animals and weapons. These are among the earliest examples of the Deccan painting style. History The manuscript was completed on 17 August 1570, in Bijapur during the regime of Ali Adil Shah I, it is a complete illustration on astrology and astral magic. The imprinted date and painting style directs that either the work was commissioned by the Bijapur sultan Ali Adil Shah (1557-1579) or by his court member. This hypothesis was strengthened by the length of the volume, the quality and quantity of its miniatures, the extensive use of gold in the manuscript, and the number of painters employed - all factors that seemed to suggest a royal patron. In fact, Emma Flatt's in her recent article on the Nujum al-‚Äòulum goes further to attribute, from internal evidence, the authorship to Ali Adil Shah himself \\"or at least the sixteenth-century equivalent of a celebrity ghostwriter\\". The author and professor O P Parameswaran writes that; This school of Bijapur was patronised by Adil Shah I (1558-1580) and his successor Ibrahim II (1580-1627), both of whom were patrons of art & letters while the latter was an expert in Indian music and author of a book on this subject, the Nauras Nama. The rulers of Bijapur used to have cordial relations with Turkey and Persia and the astronomical illustrations in this book are well derive from an Ottoman Turkish manuscript, such as the work of Fuzuli. Description Description about the manuscript as mentioned in the Chester Beatty Library says; Nujum al-‚Äòulum (‚ÄòStars of the Sciences‚Äô) is a compendium of Muslim and Hindu beliefs mainly dealing with astrology and magic. Depending on how they are counted, the manuscript contains between four and almost eight hundred llustrations. The folios included here illustrate the northern constellations Andromeda (portrayed as a woman) and the Horse; the Sun in a chariot; the zodiac sign Leo (a lion) with accompanying naksatras (mansions of the moon) and degrees; Jupiter depicted as an elderly king in procession; and the Universal Ruler upon his seven-storied throne. The only other copy of this text known was also produced in Bijapur, about a hundred years later, and is also in the Chester Beatty Library.
