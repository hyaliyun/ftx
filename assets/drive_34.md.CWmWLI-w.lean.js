A colorless gas, it is the simplest enol ether. It is used as a synthetic building block, as is the related compound ethyl vinyl ether (a liquid at room temperature). Preparation Methyl vinyl ether can be made by reaction of acetylene and methanol in presence of a base. Reactions The alkene portion of the molecule is reactive in many ways. It is prone to polymerization, leading to formation of polyvinyl ethers. Polymerization is typically initiated with Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride. This mode of reactivity is analogous to the way vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride can be polymerized to form polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl chloride, respectively. Methyl vinyl ether also participates in [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. Its reaction with acrolein is the first step in the commercial synthesis of glutaraldehyde. The alkene can be deprotonated at the vinyl carbon adjacent to the oxygen. In particular, this approach allows the synthesis of a variety of acyl derivatives of silicon, germanium, and tin that cannot be made easily by other routes. Toxicity The toxicity of vinyl ethers has been heavily investigated because divinyl ether has been used as an anesthetic. The acute LD50 for methyl vinyl ether is greater than 4 g/kg (rats, oral).

The species epithet mohriana honors the pharmacist and botanist Charles Mohr of Alabama.Oklahoma Biological Survey Distribution The Mohr oak is abundant in western Texas. It also grows in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Coahuila. Description The Mohr oak can be a small tree up to six meters (20 feet) high or a large thicket-forming shrub. The bark is light brown, rough and deeply furrowed. The twigs are yellowish or whitish, with short velvety hairs, becoming smooth with age. The buds are dark red-brown, sparsely covered with hairs. The leaves are shiny, leathery, dark blue-gray and densely covered with light gray hairs underneath. They have entire margins and are occasionally toothed. The inflorescence, which appears in spring, is reddish. There are female catkins with one to three flowers and male catkins with numerous flowers. The acorn cups are deep and the acorns grow singly or in pairs and are light brown, broadly ovoid with a rounded apex. Habitat The preferred habitat of this oak is on dry limestone or calcareous slopes at a height of between 600 and 2500 meters (2000‚Äì8300 feet) above sea level, in chaparral and desert scrub savanna. It thrives in regions that receive less than twenty five inches (63 cm) of annual rainfall.Texas Native Plants It grows in association with true mountain-mahogany Cercocarpus montanus, desert ceanothus Ceanothus greggii, the sandpaper oak Quercus pungens, oneseed juniper Juniperus monosperma, cane cholla Opuntia imbricata, purplefruited pricklypear Opuntia phaeacantha, Mexican buckeye Ungnadia speciosa, Texas persimmon Diospyros texana, hairy tridens Erioneuron pilosum and plateau oak Quercus fusiformis.Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. 1992.

It was built in 1858, originally on on the Long Island Sound, by Benjamin Pike, Jr., born in 1809, a noted manufacturer of scientific instruments located in lower Manhattan. After his death in 1864, his widow sold the Mansion to William Steinway of Steinway & Sons in 1870. Jack Halberian purchased the Mansion in 1926 and upon his death in 1976, his son Michael Halberian began an extensive restoration. The house had been for sale since his death in 2010. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a city landmark in 1966, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The property was purchased by undisclosed buyers in 2014. Description The Steinway Mansion is a large Italianate Villa style dwelling. The architect is unknown. It is constructed of granite and bluestone with cast iron ornamentation and has a two-story, T-shaped central section, with a slate covered gable roof. It has a one-story library wing with large bay windows. It features a four-story tower topped by a balustrade and octagonal cupola. There are three porches supported by cast iron Corinthian order columns. There are five Italian marble fireplaces, pocket doors that hold original cut glass depicting many of Pike's 19th-century scientific instruments. The center main hall contains elaborate carved walnut balustrades, a two-story domed rotunda topped with a central stained glass skylight and ceilings throughout. There are three large underground cisterns designed to collect rain water from the roof for grounds irrigation and a 1000-gallon () copper tank in the attic to furnish the house with a pressurized water system for bath and kitchen use. In 2006, a documentary film titled The Steinway Mansion was produced and includes extensive interviews with Michael Halberian and Henry Steinway and many rare photos.

Set in the 19th century, it is a free interpretation of the Faust legend and its respective literary adaptations by both Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1808) as well as Thomas Mann. The dialogue is in German. The film won the Golden Lion at the 68th Venice International Film Festival. At the 2012 Russian Guild of Film Critics Awards the film was awarded the prizes for Best Film, Best Director (Alexander Sokurov), Best Script (Yuri Arabov) and Best Male Supporting Actor (Anton Adasinsky). It received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot Heinrich Faust (Johannes Zeiler) is driven by his longing for enlightenment. He seeks to understand the very nature of life and how it makes the world go round. Driven by his burning desire for cognition, he even unearths corpses and rummages in their guts just to localize the home of the soul. While he keeps on telling himself \\"in the beginning was the word\\", he gets to know the racketeer Mauricius (Anton Adassinsky), playing a worldly version of Mephistopheles, who eventually contradicts him: \\"In the beginning was the deed\\". In spite of being amorphic, Mauricius considers himself an √úbermensch. Faust's obscure new friend takes him to the twilight zones of their small town. In a bath, his attention is caught by the young Margarete (Isolda Dychauk), also known as \\"Gretchen\\". Later the two new friends are entangled in a pub brawl, Faust accidentally kills Gretchen's brother. Faust becomes obsessed with Gretchen, who appears to embody the beauty of blooming life. He indulges himself in thinking that studying her would be reasonable as a part of his research about what makes all the difference between life and death. When the aging Faust has become irreversibly infatuated with Gretchen, Mephistopheles offers him to let him have her. Faust cannot resist the idea of spending a night with Gretchen. Yet Mauricius demands nothing less than Faust's soul in return. Faust even has to sign the contract with his own blood. Now living on borrowed time, Faust can pursue Gretchen, but he is haunted by penitence and fear. Finally Faust cannot bear Mauricius' nihilistic comments anymore. Overwhelmed with wrath, he buries Mauricius under rocks and finds himself lost in the middle of nowhere. Cast * Johannes Zeiler as Faust * Anton Adasinsky as Moneylender (Mephistopheles) * Isolda Dychauk as Gretchen * Georg Friedrich as Wagner * Hanna Schygulla as the Moneylender's'wife' * Antje Lewald as Gretchen's mother * Florian Brueckner as Valentin * Sigurdur Skulasson as Faust's father * Maxim Mehmet as Valentin's friend * Eva-Maria Kurz as Faust's cook Themes The film is the final part in a series of films where Alexander Sokurov explores the corrupting effects of power. The previous installments are three biographical dramas: about Adolf Hitler in Moloch from 1999, Vladimir Lenin in Taurus from 2001, and the Japanese emperor Hirohito in The Sun from 2005. Producer Andrey Sigle said about Faust: \\"The film has no particular relevance to contemporary events in the world ‚Äì it is set in the early 19th century ‚Äì but reflects Sokurov's enduring attempts to understand man and his inner forces.\\" Beyond the themes within the actual film, the project also had a political dimension. Sigle said: \\"The film is a big Russian cultural project and for Putin is very important. He saw it as a film that can introduce the Russian mentality into European culture; to promote integration between Russian and European culture.\\" Production The project, described in 2005 as \\"loosely based on works by Goethe and Thomas Mann\\", was announced by Sokurov in 2005 as \\"a very colourful, elegant picture with a lot of Strauss music and a smell of chocolate.\\" The eight-million euro film was produced by the St. Petersburg- based company Proline Film and received support from the Mass Media Support Fund of Russia. Filming started 17 August 2009 in the Czech Republic, where it continued for two months. Locations included the castles of Toƒçn√≠k, Lipnice nad S√°zavou and Ledeƒç, as well as the town Kutn√° Hora. Studio scenes were shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague. Photography also took place in Germany. In October the team moved to Iceland for several days of filming resulting in some astonishing shots of geysers. Release The film premiered on 8 September 2011 in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival. Three days later it was screened in the Masters section of the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. =Reception= Faust has an approval rating of 65% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 37 reviews, and an average rating of 6.60/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"It strays from the source, but whatever it might lack in fidelity, Aleksandr Sokurov's lengthy, ambitious Faust more than makes up in fresh energy and ideas\\". It also has a score of 65 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Jay Weissberg wrote in Variety: \\"Forget Marlowe, Goethe, Gounod and Murnau, or rather, lay them aside, since the idiosyncratic helmer adds his own spin on the classic legend, and an over- familiarity with Faust's previous incarnations will likely hinder understanding.\\" In a reservation, Weissberg wrote that Sokurov's \\"established fans\\" will be \\"the only audience for this largely impenetrable though undeniably impressive indulgence\\". Regarding the visuals, he noted the unexpected collaboration between the cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel and Sokurov, and wrote: \\"[W]hile the stillness that marks the first films of his quartet (self-lensed) is little in evidence, visuals here are striking in their mottled gray tonalities. ... The influence of Flemish and Dutch painting on Sokurov's work has never been clearer than in Faust, with its deep debt to the witchcraft paintings of artists such as David Teniers and Herri met de Bles.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote: \\"...and bliss out the next on the delirium that is ‚ÄúFaust,‚Äù the latest from Alexander Sokurov (‚ÄúRussian Ark‚Äù). An eccentric interpretation of the Goethe play, ‚ÄúFaust‚Äù is mesmerizing, at times predictably if divertingly bewildering and beautiful, with images that burn into your memory, like that of an embracing couple falling into a lake in a vision of desire and the abyss that invokes ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAtalante‚Äù but is definitely Sokurovian.\\" At the closing ceremony of the Venice Film Festival, Faust was honoured with the festival's highest prize for best film, the Golden Lion. The jury president was the American filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, who said when he presented the winner: \\"There are some films that make you cry, there are some films that make you laugh, there are some films that change you forever after you see them; and this is one of them.\\" References External links  \\"Faust\\", Proline Film * Faust Filming locations with real photos at Movieloci.com Category:2011 films Category:Films based on Goethe's Faust Category:Films based on works by Thomas Mann Category:Films directed by Alexander Sokurov Category:Films set in the 19th century Category:Films set in Germany Category:Films shot in Germany Category:Films shot in Iceland Category:Films shot in the Czech Republic Category:German- language films Category:Golden Lion winners Category:Russian films Category:Russian films based on plays ","title":"Faust (2011 film)"},{"id":"30624552","text":"Fort Totten Officers' Club, also known as the Castle, is a historic clubhouse located at Fort Totten in Bayside, Queens, New York.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Requeixo, Nossa Senhora de F√°tima e Nariz. It was named for S√£o Pedro de N√°ris. With an area of , it is made of localities of Nariz, Verba and Vessada. Its population was 1,467 in 2001. History The existence of a settlement in Nariz was first referred to in the population cadastre () ordered by Manuel I of Portugal in 1521 (completed in 1527). At the time the region was already part of the municipality of Aveiro. The origin of its name remains clouded in mystery, although it could have been a colloquial term of derision, to indicate a rural backwater. In the 13th century, it was also likely to have been designated as Amalarici (\\"town\\"), which presupposes its translation to Mariz or Maariz, later adopting the form commonly used today. On 3 October 1775, Father Manuel do Vale, prior of Requeixo, responding to an inquiry on 22 September, referred to the ecclesiastical parish that existed, encompassing the places of Requeixo, Narix and P√≥voa, which were supported by individual financial clerks and clergy (the co-adjuster for Nariz was Father Francisco Rodriques √Ålvares, from Recard√£es). This branch of the parish of Requeixo included a small population of 164 dwellings dispersed in the hamlets of Nariz, Cabe√ßo da Eireira, Canissais, Porto de Ilhavo, Verba, Vessada and Ramalheiro. The archive at the University of Coimbra holds a document dated 7 March 1811, that was presented by the local brotherhood of S√£o Pedro and villagers from Nariz, requesting the authority to have the blessed sacrament in the sacristy of the local chapel during Lent. The parish of S√£o Pedro de Nariz was created by the Bishop of Aveiro, D. Manuel Pacheco de Resende, in January 1819, de-annexing it from Requeixo. Its first parish priest was Father Pedro Duarte Rosa, until 31 December 1829, succeeded by Father Jo√£o Sim√µes, who remained chaplain until 1808. He was succeeded by Father Jer√≥nimo Vieira de Carvalho, who was born in Nariz in 1781, and was vicar from April 1839 to January 1848, dying on 24 October 1866. At the time of its incorporation the area included 200 dwellings and more than 700 inhabitants. Its urban size hovered around this size in 1867 (215), 1896 (218), slowly creeping upwards in 1909 (226 dwellings with 958 inhabitants) and 1941 (372 dwellings with 1199 inhabitants). The Church of S√£o Pedro was constructed from the small oratory that existed on the same site, developed over time, although the first baptism on the site occurred on 27 March 1819. Geography The territory of Nariz is located in the southern extremity of the municipality of Aveiro, between the neighbouring municipalities of Vagos and Oliveira do Bairro. Architecture The Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (IGESPAR) has classified the historical main Church of Nariz/Church of S√£o Pedro as a site of public interest, owing to its history as the centre of worship and communal life. This church, originally built on a smaller chapel to the patron saint, was ordered constructed by Father Jo√£o Sim√µes in 1808. Culture The parish's main celebration is in honour of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, which is celebrated on the first Sunday of August.

He is said to have established a church in Anglesey, and although no part of the original structure remains, the current church is still dedicated to him. A nearby standing stone is said to be the remains of a man who he punished for stealing a bible from the church. Life and family The remains of a man turned to stone by St Tyfrydog for stealing a bible, according to legend Little is known for certain about Tyfrydog's life, and his dates of birth and death are unknown. He is said to have lived towards the end of the sixth century, although another account has him as active during the middle of the fifth century.Williams, pp. 503‚Äì504. His father is recorded as being Arwystli Glof ab Seithenyn, active in the middle of the sixth century. Both he and his father are said to have been part of the Christian community on Bardsey Island, at the tip of the Ll≈∑n Peninsula in north-west Wales.Williams, p. 26 Some of his siblings are also venerated as saints.

Commemoration Tyfrydog is the patron saint and the reputed founder of St Tyfrydog's Church, Llandyfrydog, a small village in Anglesey, north Wales. The tradition is that he established the church in about 450. No part of a building from that period survives; the earliest parts of the present structure date from about 1400. Llandyfrydog takes its name from the church and the saint: the Welsh word ' originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"-dyfrydog\\" is a modified form of his name. He is venerated as a saint, although he was never canonized by a pope: as the historian Jane Cartwright notes, \\"In Wales sanctity was locally conferred and none of the medieval Welsh saints appears to have been canonized by the Roman Catholic Church\\". The feast day of St Tyfrydog is 1 January. About from the church, there is a field with an upright stone about high. The stone is known as \\"the thief of Dyfrydog\\". It is said to be a man turned into stone by St Tyfyrdog for stealing the church's bible; the lump near the top of the stone is said to be the sack on the man's shoulder.Baring-Gould, pp. 292‚Äì293 It is also said that the man's soul is periodically chased around the field during the night, chased by \\"demons with red-hot pitchforks.\\" See also Other Anglesey saints commemorated in local churches include: *St Caffo at St Caffo's Church, Llangaffo *St Cwyllog at St Cwyllog's Church, Llangwyllog *St Eleth at St Eleth's Church, Amlwch *St Iestyn at St Iestyn's Church, Llaniestyn *St Peulan at St Peulan's Church, Llanbeulan References ;Notes ;Bibliography Category:5th-century people Category:6th-century people Category:Medieval Welsh saints ","title":"Tyfrydog"},{"id":"30624612","text":"Temnora reutlingeri is a moth of the family Sphingidae.

The revolt was led by Muslim leaders Haxhi Qamili, Arif Hiqmeti, Musa Qazimi and Mustafa Ndroqi. As well as total amnesty, the rebels demanded the return of Albania to the suzerainty of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.  Background  Prince William and his wife Sophie arriving in Albania on March 7, 1914 Prince Wilhelm of Wied took the throne of Principality of Albania on March 7, 1914, and had to face a chaotic political situation, both within the country and with its neighbours. Based on the Treaty of London signed on May 30, 1913, the Great Powers resolved on July 29, 1913 that they should establish International gendarmerie to take care of public order and security on the territory of newly recognized Principality of Albania. On the same basis they established International Commission of Control (ICC) on October 15, 1913, to take care of the administration of newly established Albania until its own political institutions were in order. Prince Wilhelm of Wied had to deal with a difficult political situation: # Essad Pasha Toptani, who dominated new government of the Principality of Albania because he was both minister of interior and minister of war. By choosing to reside in Durres instead of Shkod√´r, the prince of Wied was at mercy of Essad Pasha. # the International Commission of Control and foreign advisers who still had great deal of authority # the representatives of Austria-Hungary and Italy # the resistance in Northern Epirus, which was finally given a special administration by Protocol of Corfu # the fighting between forces under control of Essad Pasha Toptani and the Provisional Government of Albania # the major peasant revolt of mostly pro-Ottoman Muslim peasants. There were numerous armed groups in Principality of Albania during regime of prince Wilhelm: # the International Gendarmerie under control of the International Commission of Control and prince Wilhelm # the irregular bands of southerners led by local leaders # the native outlaw # the Bulgarian outlaw, Komitadjis # the Greek rebels from the Northern Epirus # the peasant rebels in central Albania # Essad Pasha's gendarmerie # the Romanian volunteers # the Austro- Hungarian volunteers # the volunteers from Kosovo led by Isa Boletini # the Mirdita Catholic volunteers from the northern mountains under the command of Pr√™nk Bib√´ Doda Essad Pasha Toptani, as minister of war and interior, was against peaceful solution of problem with Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence of February 28, 1914. He opposed International Commission of Control which believed that problem can be solved by diplomatic means. Prince and his cabinet accepted proposals of Essad Pasha to decide for military solution. In order to increase the military strength of the Principality of Albania, several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of the central Albania. The rebellion was only tacitly supported by the Ottomans, who as a consequence of the Balkan Wars were physically separated from the Albanian lands. The Ottoman preoccupation with the looming First World War also rendered diplomatic and material support impractical.  Events  = The plot of pro-Ottoman Albanians = Ahmed Izzet Pasha A plot by the Young Turk government and led by Bekir Fikri to restore Ottoman control over Albania through the installment of an Ottoman-Albanian officer Ahmed Izzet Pasha as monarch was uncovered by the Serbs and reported to the ICC. Ismail Qemali supported the plot for military assistance against Serbia and Greece. The ICC allowed their Dutch officers serving as the Albanian Gendarmerie to declare a state of emergency and stop the plot. They raided Vlor√´ on 7‚Äì8 January 1914, discovering more than 200 Ottoman troops and arrested Fikri. During Fikri's trial the plot emerged and an ICC military court under Colonel Willem de Veer condemned him to death and later commuted to life imprisonment, while Qemali and his cabinet resigned. After Qemali left the country, turmoil ensued throughout Albania. At that time the Commission was not able to force Essad Pasha to leave Albania, because it did not have enough authority. = Revolt = Prince Wilhelm of Wied, Isa Boletini and officers of the International Gendarmerie: Duncan Heaton-Armstrong and Colonel Thomson near Durres in June 1914 The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime of the Principality of Albania was a tool of the six Christian Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. Revolt was led by Muslim leaders Haxhi Qamili, Arif Hiqmeti, Musa Qazimi and Mustafa Ndroqi. This group of discontented Muslim clerics gathered around Essad Pasha Toptani who proclaimed himself the savior of Albania and Islam. After receiving the news that thousands of rebels surrounded Shijak on May 17 (only 10 km from Durres), Essad Pasha Toptani was accused of fomenting the revolt against William of Wied. He was exiled to Italy on May 20, without trial. In Italy, he was received with honor since both Italian and Austrian representatives played roles in intrigues that surrounded the revolt. The chaos and revolts deteriorated after Essad Pasha was exiled. In order to gain support of the Mirdita Catholic volunteers from the northern mountains Prince of Wied appointed their leader, Pr√™nk Bib√´ Doda, to be the foreign minister of the Principality of Albania. The International Dutch Gendarmerie was also joined by Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo. Dutch gendarmes together with northern Mirdita Catholics attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged the rebels on May 23, they were surrounded and captured, as well as another expedition from Durres which attempted to release the captured gendarmes. Rebels launched the attack on Durres and even started firing on it with their light weapons. The people in Durres panicked and the Prince and his family found shelter on an Italian ship anchored in the bay. On the same evening the rebels released Dutch officer and sent him to Prince of Wied with their demands: * total amnesty * return of Albania under suzerainty of sultan of Ottoman Empire On 14 August, the rebels attacked the capital, which was protected mainly by Romanian and Austrian volunteers. The first insurgent attack lasted half an hour and was repulsed with heavy losses for the attackers. The second attack began after an hour, and lasted also for an hour, before it was once again repulsed, mainly due to the brave actions of the Romanians, who were greatly praised by their Christian Albanian comrades. After half an hour, the insurgents launched their third and final attack, but they were repelled everywhere by stiff Romanian resistance.\\"Rom√¢nul\\" newspaper, 9/22 august 1914 edition (Romanian) Prince of Wied appointed Colonel Thomson to be commander of defence of Durr√´s. He was killed on June 15, during a rebel attack. During next week Dutch officers were captured by rebels in most of the central Albania. The rebels captured Berat on July 12 and Vlore, without fight, on August 21. Only a week after prince Wilhelm of Wied's departure from Durres on September 3, 1914, another violent revolt arose. The rebels managed to lay siege on Durres, imprison Wied's supporters, to call for Muslim prince and to establish the Senate of Central Albania. Insurgents hoisted the flag of the Ottoman Empire. Vast majority of population living in the northern and the southern part of Albania disassociated themselves from the Senate of Central Albania. Haxhi Qamili and his supporters were reported to have persecuted, bound, tortured and killed many teachers of the Albanian language. Because he supported the usage of the Arabic alphabet (as opposed to the Latin one), he viewed them as enemies of Turkey. The revolt failed to generate much support in the regions surrounding Elbasan, which were inhabited by mix of Sunni, Bektashi and Orthodox Albanians, with the Sunnis being the most numerous. The local Muslims were noted for their opposition to ideas deemed \\"fanatical\\", and their identification with Albanian nationalism. Much of this is attributed to the charismatic leadership of the Albanian nationalist Aqif Pasha. Local Islamic leaders also denounced the \\"archaic\\" ideas of Haxhi Qamili, and supported the adoption of the Latin alphabet, contradicting much of the Sunni clergy elsewhere. The representative of Elbasan in Haxhi Qamili's uprising, Haxhi Feza, withdrew from the movement in protest against Haxhi Qamili's excesses, and for this, Haxhi Qamili personally ordered him to be imprisoned.Carcani, Leonard.

Dutch officers were gradually replaced with officers from Austria-Hungary and Germany, who arrived in Durr√´s on July 4. Soon the First World War broke out and by August 4 most of Dutch officers returned to Netherlands. In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha decided to accept invitation of Senate of the Central Albania to return to Albania to take over the power. First, he had to provide financial backing for his government. Therefore, he travelled to Ni≈°, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Pa≈°iƒá signed the secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on September 17, 1914. In October 1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dib√´r and captured the interior of Albania, including Dures.  Atrocities  During the revolt the \\"disciplinary forces\\" of rebels headed by the mufti of Tirana, Musa Qazimi, carried out executions in order to \\"clean\\" the \\"Bektashi schismatics\\". Other targets besides \\"Bektashi schismatics\\" included Christians, Albanian nationalist teachers who had been teaching using the Latin alphabet, and even Muslim clerics who were supporters of Albanian nationhood.

Life Ball was born on 13 March 1734. When John Wesley and other Methodist preachers visited High Wycombe, in Bucks where she lived for most of her life, she was attracted by their teaching. In 1766 she began to keep a diary, some extracts of which have been published. Several of the letters that passed between her and Wesley have also been printed. By Wesley's advice she broke off an engagement to be married to one who, in the language of the sect, was 'an ungodly man.' She was a mystic, and Wesley warns her that 'a clear revelation of several persons in the ever blessed Trinity was by no means a sure trial to Christian perfection.' Hannah Ball died on 16 August 1792. Sunday schools In 1769 she began a Sunday school. It was continued by her sister Anne, was reorganised in 1801, and lasted late into the nineteenth century. The germ of the modern Sunday school may be traced in the methods of instruction established by Luther, John Knox, and St. Charles Borromeo. There are traces of them in France in the seventeenth century. The Rev. Joseph Alleine was in the habit of drawing young pupils together for instruction on the Sunday. Bishop Thomas Wilson instituted such schools in the Isle of Man in 1703. The Seventh Day Baptists had one between 1740 and 1747 at Euphrata, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1763 Mrs. Catharine Cappe and the Rev. Theophilus Lindsey had such a gathering of the young at Catterick. Dr. Kennedy, about 1770, established one in Bright parish, co. Down. In 1778 the Rev. David Simpson opened one at Macclesfield. There was another at Little Lever, taught by 'Owd Jemmy o' th' Hey,' whose services were paid for by a wealthy piper-maker, Adam Crompton. These and others preceded the experiment made at Gloucester in 1783 by Robert Raikes, who is often described as the founder of Sunday schools.

The traditional houses and settlements of the several hundreds ethnic groups of Indonesia are extremely varied and all have their own specific history. Ethnic groups in Indonesia are often associated with their own distinctive form of rumah adat.Dawson (1994), p. 10 The houses are at the centre of a web of customs, social relations, traditional laws, taboos, myths and religions that bind the villagers together. The house provides the main focus for the family and its community, and is the point of departure for many activities of its residents.Dawson (1994), p. 8 Villagers build their own homes, or a community pools its resources for a structure built under the direction of a master builder or carpenter. The vast majority of Indonesians no longer live in rumah adat, and the numbers have declined rapidly due to economic, technological, and social changes. General form With few exceptions, the peoples of the Indonesian archipelago share a common Austronesian ancestry (originating in Taiwan, c. 6,000 years ago) or Sundaland , a sunken area in South East Asia, and traditional homes of Indonesia share a number of characteristics such as timber construction, varied and elaborate roof structures.The Oxford Companion to Architecture, Volume 1, p. 462. The earliest Austronesian structures were communal longhouses on stilts, with steep sloping roofs and heavy gables, as seen in the Batak rumah adat and the Torajan Tongkonan. Variations on the communal longhouse principle are found among the Dayak people of Borneo, as well as the Mentawai people. A fishing village of pile houses in the Riau archipelago The norm is for a post, beam and lintel structural system that take load straight to the ground with either wooden or bamboo walls that are non-load bearing. Traditionally, rather than nails, mortis and tenon joints and wooden pegs are used. Natural materials - timber, bamboo, thatch and fibre - make up rumah adat. Hardwood is generally used for piles and a combination of soft and hard wood is used for the house's upper non-load bearing walls, and are often made of lighter wood or thatch.Dawson (1994), p. 12 The thatch material can be coconut and sugar palm leaves, alang alang grass and rice straw. Traditional dwellings have developed to respond to natural environmental conditions, particularly Indonesia's hot and wet monsoon climate. As is common throughout South East Asia and the South West Pacific, most rumah adat are built on stilts, with the exception of Java, Bali, and other houses of Eastern Indonesia. Building houses off the ground on stilts serve a number of purposes: it allows breezes to moderate the hot tropical temperatures; it elevates the dwelling above stormwater runoff and mud; it allows houses to be built on rivers and wetland margins; it keeps people, goods and food from dampness and moisture; lifts living quarters above malaria-carrying mosquitos; and reduces the risk of dry rot and termites.Dawson (1994), pp. 10-11 The sharply inclined roof allows the heavy tropical rain to quickly sheet off, and large overhanging eaves keep water out of the house and provide shade in the heat.Dawson (1994), p. 11 In hot and humid low-lying coastal regions, homes can have many windows providing good cross-ventilation, whereas in cooler mountainous interior areas, homes often have a vast roof and few windows. Examples Examples of rumah adat include: *Batak architecture (North Sumatra) includes the boat-shaped jabu homes of the Toba Batak people, with dominating carved gables and dramatic oversized roof, and are based on an ancient model. *The Minangkabau of West Sumatra build the rumah gadang, distinctive for their multiple gables with dramatically upsweeping ridge ends. *The homes of Nias peoples include the omo sebua chiefs' houses built on massive ironwood pillars with towering roofs. Not only are they almost impregnable to attack in former tribal warfare, but flexible nail-less construction provide proven earthquake durability. *Rumah Melayu Malay traditional houses built on stilts of Sumatra, Borneo and Malay Peninsula. *The Riau region is characterised by villages built on stilts over waterways. *Sundanese imah usually take basic form of gabled roof called kampung style roof, made of thatched materials (ijuk black aren fibers or hateup leaves) with weaved bamboo wall and structure built on short stilts. The more elaborate overhanging gabled roof is called Julang Ngapak. *Unlike most South East Asian vernacular homes, Javanese omah are not built on piles, and have become the Indonesian vernacular style most influenced by European architectural elements. *The Bubungan Tinggi, with their steeply pitched roofs, are the large homes of Banjarese royalty and aristocrats in South Kalimantan. *Traditional Balinese homes are a collection of individual, largely open structures (including separate structures for the kitchen, sleeping areas, bathing areas and shrine) within a high-walled garden compound. *The Sasak people of Lombok build lumbung, pile-built bonnet-roofed rice barns, that are often more distinctive and elaborate than their houses (see Sasak architecture). *Dayak people traditionally live in communal longhouses that are built on piles. The houses can exceed 300 m in length, in some cases forming a whole village. *The Toraja of the Sulawesi highlands are renowned for their tongkonan, houses built on piles and dwarfed by massive exaggerated-pitch saddle roofs. *Rumah adat on Sumba have distinctive thatched \\"high hat\\" roofs and are wrapped with sheltered verandahs. *The Papuan Dani traditionally live in small family compounds composed of several circular huts known as honay with thatched dome roofs.

This trend dates from the colonial period, with the Dutch generally viewing traditional architecture as unhygienic, with big roofs that sheltered rats.Nas, p. 348 Multi-family homes were viewed with suspicion by religious authorities, as were those aspects of the rumah adat linked to traditional belief. In parts of the Indies, colonial authorities embarked on vigorous demolition programmes, replacing traditional homes with houses built using Western construction techniques, such as bricks and corrugated iron roofs, fitting sanitary facilities and better ventilation. Traditional craftsmen were retrained in Western building techniques.Nas, p. 347 Since independence, the Indonesian government has continued to promote the 'rumah sehat sederhana' ('simple healthy home') over the rumah adat.Transformation of Building Form: Development of Traditional Dwelling of the Ngada, Central Flores Island - Toga H Pandjaitan Exposure to the market economy made the construction of labour-intensive rumah adat, such as the Batak house, extremely expensive (previously villages would work together to construct new homes) to build and maintain. In addition, deforestation and population growth meant that the hardwoods were no longer a free resource to be gathered as needed from nearby forests, but instead a too-expensive commodity. Combined with a general appetite for modernity, the great majority of Indonesians now dwell in generic modern buildings rather than traditional rumah adat. In areas with many tourists, such as the Tanah Toraja, rumah adat are preserved as a spectacle for tourists, their former residents living elsewhere, with design elements exaggerated to the point that these rumah adat are considerably less comfortable than the original designs.Nas, p. 352 While in most areas rumah adat have been abandoned, in a few remote areas they are still current, and in other areas buildings in the style of the rumah adat are maintained for ceremonial purposes, as museums or for official buildings. Contemporary adaptation Gates and pavilions of annual Gambir Fair draw influences and combine elements from rumah adat, such as these pavilion that combines Karo, Minang and Javanese style. During the colonial Dutch East Indies period around the first half of the 20th century, the typical style and elements of vernacular Indonesian rumah adat were often used as the inspiration, recreated and replicated intentionally to represent the cultural diversity of the colony, also intended to create a festive atmosphere with fantastic architecture. The annual Pasar Gambir for example ‚Äî a fair held between 1906 to 1942 in Batavia, was known to have gates, stages, towers and pavilions constructed in rumah adat style drawn from all over the archipelago. Each year, these uniquely designed rumah adat pavilions were created and constructed anew using locally available materials, thus also become the attraction of the fair. The Dutch colonial pavilion in Paris Colonial Exposition 1931 showcasing a synthesis of various rumah adat of the Dutch East Indies. This period also saw the pride and desire to showcase the cultural diversity of the colony through showcasing the vernacular architecture of the archipelago. In 1931, during Paris Colonial Exposition, the Netherlands presented a beautiful cultural synthesis from their colony ‚Äî the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch colonial pavilion was located on exhibition lot as wide as 3 hectares and was built based on the combination of many cultural elements of the Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago), a combination of Indonesian vernacular architecture. It has walls consisted of 750,000 pieces of ironwood from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo). As the centerpiece, the front part is decorated with twin 50 metres-tall Balinese Meru towers. The pavilion's roof was done in tumpang or tajug style, a signature of Javanese mosque, completed with carved wooden door of kori agung typical towering portal of pura Balinese temple, combined with arched roof of Minangkabau's atap bagonjong typical of rumah gadang. This fusion of Indonesian vernacular architecture presented a splendid and majestic palace-like pavilion. However, on 28 June 1931, an enormous fire burnt down the Dutch pavilion, along with all cultural objects displayed inside. The House of the Five Senses, Efteling theme park, The Netherlands. An example of a modern building constructed using Western techniques, based on a rumah gadang design Buildings are sometimes built with modern construction techniques that include stylistic elements from rumah adat, such as The House of the Five Senses in the Efteling, a building modeled on the Minangkabau rumah gadang. In the colonial period some Europeans constructed homes according to hybrid Western-adat designs, such as Bendegom, who built a 'transitional' Western-Batak Karo house.Nas, p.349 In numbers of places, elements or ornaments of rumah adat has become the regional identity of provinces or regencies (kabupaten). Thus the construction of government and public buildings are encouraged to include or feature this native architectural elements. Despite technically the new buildings are constructed in contemporary technique with concrete frames and brick walls, instead of traditional timber carpentry. Most often the result is the implant of traditional roof sit on top of modern buildings. This tendency can be seen in West Sumatra and Tana Toraja, where the typical Minang bagonjong (horned) roof and Toraja tongkonan roof are implanted in almost any public buildings; from airports to hotels, restaurants and government offices. 2009 Padang earthquake It has been noted that the traditional wooden houses are generally more earthquake-resistant than modern brick designs, although they are more vulnerable to fire. The construction of modern concrete framed and brick walled rumah adat has undermine the very characteristic of traditional wooden house, which is its flexibility to absorb shock-waves generated by an earthquake. These concrete rumah adat-style building often can not withstand earthquake and collapsed, like those buildings collapsed in 2009 Padang earthquake. In some areas, a 'semi-modern' rumah adat concept has been adopted, such as among some Ngada people, with traditional elements placed inside a concrete shell.

After the Restoration of 1660 he was a man about town, with support from nobleman and courtiers.

Collecting career Wise began collecting books as a schoolboy, spending his pocket money at the barrows in Farringdon Street. He was a keen collector of first editions in original condition. His interests were poetry followed by drama and his collection dating back to Elizabethan publications was an exhaustive representation. His collection was funded by selling duplicates and acting as an agent for wealthy collectors. Wise was given an honorary M.A. degree by the University of Oxford and elected an honorary Fellow of Worcester College due to his services to bibliographical science. He became a member of the Consultative Committee of the Friends of the Bodleian and was elected President of the Bibliographical Society in 1922‚Äì1924. Forgeries and thefts Wise became a noted bibliographer, collector, forger, and thief. He parlayed his international reputation as a collector of books and an exposer of forgers and forgeries into a career in creating and selling forgeries. He privately printed nearly 300 works of English authors, some of which were debunked as forgeries by Carter and Pollard. In 1934 his reputation was damaged by the publication of \\"An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets\\" by John Carter and Graham Pollard. In their writing and expose, Carter and Pollard were astute in their use of irony. Carter and Pollard proved that a large number of rare first edition pamphlets from 19th century authors which depended solely on Wise's published works for their authenticity were fakes. Wise and a fellow bibliophile Harry Buxton Forman had been involved in the fabrication and sale of many of the same pamphlets to collectors. Forman and Wise's crimes are generally regarded as one of the most notorious literary scandals of the twentieth century.Collins, John, Two Forgers: A Biography of Harry Buxton Forman and Thomas James Wise, Oak Knoll Press, New Castle, Del., 1992. Shortly after Wise's death the Library was sold to the British Museum by his widow for ¬£66,000. The works were compared with the British Museum's former collection at which point it was discovered that over 200 book leaves were missing and 89 of these matching leaves were found in the Wise volumes. Henry Wrenn had built up a drama collection (housed in the University of Texas) and Wise had helped with supplying these volumes. When the Texas authorities sent relevant volumes for comparison, 60 of these books were also found to have been completed with thefts from the British Museum library. A detailed scientific investigation by David Foxon was published by the Bibliographical Society in 1959 with the conclusion that Wise must have known that some of the book leaves added to his collection were stolen and that it was probable that he had taken the leaves himself., \\"In general it seems likely that Wise would not have risked sharing his guilty knowledge with an emissary but would have made the thefts himself; the rest of this study is written on that assumption.\\" A particularly noteworthy forgery, which he authenticated as genuine and original, was an edition of E. B. Browning's Sonnets from the Portuguese said to have been published in Reading in 1847. Personal life In 1890 Wise married Selina Fanny Smith (aged 22) and they moved into 52 Ashley Road, Hornsey Rise (leading to the name of the \\"Ashley Library\\"). By 1895 Selina deserted her husband on the grounds that he was fully devoted to his book collection rather than their marriage. In 1897 they were formally divorced and Wise moved to St. George's Road in Kilburn (now Priory Terrace). Wise remarried in June 1900 to Frances Louise Greenhaigh and dedicated the final volume of the Ashley Library catalogue to her. Publications Wise's published works included detailed bibliographies of Tennyson, Swinburne, Landor, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Ruskin, the Brownings, the Bront√´s, Shelley and Conrad. He was the copyright owner and co-editor of the Bonchurch edition of Swinburne's works. Legacy The bulk of his personal papers consisting of 33 document boxes (13.86 linear feet), and 2 galley folders are at the Harry Ransom Center of The University of Texas at Austin. They are housed off site and require advance requests for examination. Another collection is at the Firestone Library at the Princeton University Library, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections. It includes 0.2 linear feet, 1 half-size archival box.

Italian irredentist Born in Fiume, then Austria-Hungary, Nino Host obtained a license to middle school, and specialized as a dentistry technician. In the eve of World War I, he enrolled the Sursum Corda. An Italian irredentist, he defected to the Italians and participated as a volunteer, with the new nom de guerre \\"Venturi\\" earning thrice a Silver Medal of Military Valor and the rank of captain of the Alpini and then the Arditi. In November 1918 he arrived in Fiume with the Italian occupation troops, and immediately was co-opted in the Italian National Council of Fiume. In Fiume in April 1919, Giovanni Venturi created the \\"Legion of Fiume\\", consisting of a core of volunteers officially to defend the city from the French army contingent in the city, who took a pro-Yugoslav stance. In May 1919, Host- Venturi went to Milan to meet Benito Mussolini, from which he obtained promises of support, and immediately after, under the auspices of Giovanni Giuriati he arranged several meetings in Rome with Gabriele D'Annunzio and was instrumental in organising his Impresa di Fiume. Between June to July 1920, Host-Venturi also opened a series of secret meetings with Croat, Montenegrin and Albanian separatists to explore the possibility of a concerted campaign that aimed to \\"prevent the consolidation of the so-called Yugoslavia\\".  Fascist leader  As a Fascist exponent Host-Venturi was among the advocates of forced assimilation of non-native populations present in Venezia Giulia. In a speech held on 23 May 1925 at the Congress of Istrian Fascists, he denounced the use of the Slavic language by local Slovenes and Croats during their church attendance. In 1927, at a conference that took place in Trieste, Host- Venturi with Bruno Coceani, Joseph Cobolli and other leaders from Venezia Giulia, outlined the guidelines for a complete Italianization to the \\"alloglot\\" minority in Friuli, Venezia Giulia and Zara. Host-Venturi become secretary of the Fascist Federation of Fiume from 15 November 1925 to 24 May 1928, and was a special commissioner to Pola from 1 April to 24 May 1926. He was the head of the Fascist Party (PNF), and 1934‚Äì1935 member of the Corporation of insurance and credit. From January 1935 to October 1939, Host- Venturi was secretary to the Merchant Marine. As Secretary of the Merchant Marine Host-Venturi was among those who contributed most to the consolidation of the Finmare, the Italian state shipping financial holding company which covered the maritime sector within Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI).  Minister of Communications  On 31 October 1939 Mussolini asked him to substitute Benni the guidance of the Ministry of Communications. It was a ministerial reshuffle which served to alienate Mussolini \\"technocrats\\" who until then had in hand the most important economic ministries. The decision was made in the climate of controversy so-called \\"anti-bourgeois\\" and was not foreign to the approach of Mussolini's decision to war. A leading such sensitive areas he wanted to call people to PNF trusted men of the \\"fascist revolution\\", and Host-Venturi was certainly one of these. As war approached Italian territory Giovanni Host Venturi created a special anti guerrilla unit the \\"Nucleo paracadutisti dalmati\\" to support the dalmatian Chetniks against Tito's partisans. Host-Venturi remained at the Ministry of Communications until 6 February 1943, when he was replaced by Senator Vittorio Cini, this time following a massive government reshuffle which saw the removal of fascist authority following the heavy military defeats and the approaching invasion of national territory by the Allies. Five months before the fall of fascism, for reasons that are not known to us, Host-Venturi was ousted from the government by Mussolini as a result of a deep reshuffling of the government operated by the \\"Duce.\\" He joined the Italian Social Republic, although not holding office or senior positions.  After the war  At the end of the war chose to leave Italy. He moved to Argentina in 1948. Franco Venturi, his son, was born in Rome in 1937, and emigrated at an early age in Argentina together with his father and family, where he became a painter and cartoonist. Franco Venturi was seized in Mar del Plata on 24 February 1976 and was considered as a desaparecido in the 1980s. Nino Host-Venturi died in 1980 by committing suicide in Buenos Aires.

Description Groups of round houses about 9 metres in diameter and built on piles formed Enggano villages. Wood or bamboo were used for walls, and roofs were thatched with woven rattan leaves. Two to four large planks of wood were tightly fastened to form a circular, disc-like floor, into which the roof rafters were sunk. The house interiors consisted of one large room surrounding a hearth. Adults slept in this main room, while children and adolescents slept in less substantial rooms and shelters. The houses were accessed via a notched wooden beam. A kadiofe was the public meeting hall of a village. They were rectangular pile-built structures with rattan roofs and four open sides. Unfortunately, the last of the traditional beehive houses of Enggano were likely torn down before the arrival of the Rhenish Missionary Society in 1902, and the best source for pre-20th century Engganese cultural practices are the writings of Italian anthropologist Elio Modigliani, who spent several months on the island in 1891.

Karunakaran-led United Democratic Front government of the state of Kerala, India through the Power and Energy Limited Company. The Kerala government selected Power and Energy Limited arbitrarily without inviting tenders, allegedly at an inflated price and at an excessive service charge and in violation of central and state government procedure. The Palmolein import scam was first brought to light officially by a report of the Accountant- General of Kerala in July 1993, a Comptroller and Auditor General report in February 1994, and subsequently by a report of the Public Undertakings Committee of the Kerala Legislative Assembly in March 1996. After a Left government came to power in May 1996, a vigilance case was registered against Karunakaran and six others on 21 March 1997. Following an inquiry, a charge sheet was submitted to the Court of the Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Trivandrum, on 23 March 2001. The case dragged on, with Karunakaran filing writ petitions and appeals before the Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court of India, raising the plea of bad faiths (mala fides) and eventually obtaining a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in August 2007. The appeal remained pending before the Supreme Court of India until Karunakaran's death in December 2010. Case The government of Kerala decided to import 15,000 tonnes of palm oil from Power and Energy Ltd, a Malaysian company in Singapore, at a price higher than on the open market. The price of import was fixed to USD405 per tonne, while the international market price was USD392.25 per tonne. The import order was signed by P. J. Thomas, who was then Kerala's Food Secretary. The investigation agency's charge sheet says that this order caused a loss of more than 2.32 crores to the public finances. The opposition cried foul in the import. A vigilance case was filed against K. Karunakaran and seven others, including Thomas.A Special Leave Petition by Karunakaran made the Supreme Court of India stay the proceedings against him. The court closed the proceedings entirely against Karunakaran after his death in December 2010. Thomas was bailed in 2003. The case was reopened in March 2011.Palmolein import scandal case to be reopened The Economic Times,Thiruvananthapuram, 15 March 2011 In August 2011, Oommen Chandy, as the then Finance Minister in Karunakaran's Cabinet and the Chief Minister of Kerala, was also added to the new investigation. The court asked the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to submit its investigation report by 10 November 2011.Palm oil deal glare on Chandy The Telegraph,Thiruvananthapuram, 8 August 2011. Chandy was the 23rd witness in the case and had been well known as the leader of the inner-party campaign launched by the A. K. Antony group within the State Congress against Karunakaran, especially on the palmolein issue during the early 1990s, when the import deal first became a controversy. =Accused= * K. Karunakaran * Former Food and Civil Supplies Minister T .H. Musthafa, a close associate of Karunakaran * Former Chief Secretary S.

Ltd, Sivaramakrishnan * P. J. Thomas Expulsion of Chief Vigilance Commissioner A debate raged against Thomas heading the position as CVC and being accused in the case. On 3 February 2011, he was finally asked to quit by the Supreme Court on the grounds that he had a corruption case pending against him. Exoneration of Chandy On 25 June 2013, the Kerala High Court exonerated Chandy. The verdict was in response to a petition, filed by CPI-M veteran V. S. Achuthanandan and former bureaucrat and legislator K.J. Alphonse, contesting a vigilance probe clean chit to Chandy in the 1999 case. The court dismissed a petition filed by CPI-M veteran V.S. Achuthanandan and former bureaucrat and legislator K.J. Alphonse. On 16 February 2016, the Supreme Court rejected Achuthanandan's plea and said that he was just dragging the case to get political mileage. The judges said \\"It seems you (Achuthanandan) want to keep the matter pending to score points against each other. Are you trying to fish in troubled waters? We will not allow this gameplan to continue.\\" References Category:Politics of Kerala Category:Political corruption in India Category:1991 in India Category:History of Kerala (1947‚Äìpresent) Category:Corruption in Kerala Category:Indian National Congress of Kerala ","title":"Palmolein Oil Import Scam"},{"id":"30625015","text":"Bulbinella rossii, commonly known as the Ross lily, is a species of flowering plant in genus Bulbinella. It is one of the subantarctic megaherbs. The specific epithet honours British Antarctic explorer James Clark Ross, who visited Campbell Island in December 1840. Description Bulbinella rossii is a large, dioecious, perennial lily, growing up to 1 m in height and with a basal diameter of 40 mm. The dark green, fleshy, strap-like leaves are 0.6‚Äì1 m long and 15‚Äì60 mm wide. The inflorescence is a cylindrical raceme up to 600 mm long. The golden yellow flowers are densely crowded, 10‚Äì14 mm in diameter, and are often flushed with orange. The ovoid seed capsule is 10 mm long, containing narrowly winged, dark brown seeds. The plant flowers from October to January and fruits from December to March. Distribution and habitat The lily is endemic to New Zealand‚Äôs subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands. There it is common and widespread from sea level to the tops of the island mountains. Because it thrives where the ground has been disturbed, and because it is not particularly palatable to browsing animals, it is common near old human habitation sites and may form dense colonies in open herbfield and tussock grassland.New Zealand Plant Conservation Network  Conservation Status  The species is listed as \\"At Risk - Naturally Uncommon\\" in the most recent (2018) assessment using New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants, because of its restricted range.Megaherb community on Campbell Island with Bulbinella rossii (yellow to orange flowers) and Anisotome latifolia (pink flowers) References =Notes= =Sources= * rossii Category:Flora of the Auckland Islands Category:Flora of the Campbell Islands ","title":"Bulbinella rossii"},{"id":"30625018","text":"Meteor Rain () is the debut Mandarin studio album of Taiwanese Mandopop quartet boy band F4.

The New Haven, Connecticut, based organization concentrated on work for Roman Catholic clients in Connecticut. Architectural practice The firm was a partnership between Howard J. Sullivan AIA and David Polak AIA (d. 1981). It was established shortly after Maurice F. McAuliffe was named the 8th Bishop of Hartford, a time that also coincided with the end of the long career of architect Joseph A. Jackson who was popular with Catholic clients. Bishop McAuliffe would go on to establish 25 new parishes and 9 parochial schools many of which were to be designed by Polak and Sullivan. From a stylistic standpoint their output is extremely varied including at various times Romanesque Revival buildings, Gothic Revival buildings, Colonial buildings, Modern buildings and even a few buildings in International Style, which was rarely used for Roman Catholic churches. In spite of their popularity with their clients there is surprisingly little information on this firm. Neither Polak nor Sullivan responded to AIA surveys conducted in 1956, 1962 and 1970. It does not appear that the firm was in any way associated with Yale University. Personal life Howard Sullivan was a trustee of St. Bernadette Church, one of the first designed by his firm and a member of the Knights of Columbus. In 1956 he was the recipient of the Knights of Columbus 7th annual Charles Carroll of Carrollton Award for outstanding leadership. For many years Sullivan was a member (along with fellow church architect J. Gerald Phelan) of the Architectural Registration Board of Connecticut, appointed by and reporting to the governor. Sullivan also served as chairman for the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven between 1970 and 1977.

Savcƒ± was the youngest of Murat's three sons. The name of his mother and birth year are unknown. In Ottoman tradition, all princes () were required to serve as provincial (sanjak) governors as a part of their training. Savcƒ±'s sanjak was Bursa, the co- capital of the empire (along with Edirne). Savci was also brother of Osman I.  Rebellion  When Ottoman Turks captured Edirne (Adrianopolis), Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos appealed to the West for help. Instead, he was detained as a debtor in Venice. Andronikos (later Andronikos IV Palaiologos), his son and regent in Constantinople (modern ƒ∞stanbul, Turkey), refused to pay the ransom for his father, and John had to give up the island Tenedos (modern Bozcaada, Turkey) to buy his freedom. After that event, John assigned his younger son Manuel (later Manuel II Palaiologos) as his crown prince and accepted the suzerainty of Ottomans in 1373. Thus, when the Ottoman sultan asked for his services against some rebellions in Ottoman lands, he had to leave his capital. This absence gave Andronikos a chance to rebel. On the Ottoman side, Savcƒ± Bey, who was the youngest of three brothers, saw that under the shadow of his older brothers, he had almost no chance to be enthroned in the future and faced a probable death under the traditional policy of fratricide in Ottoman succession. (This fear was not unreasonable; later when Murat I died older brother Beyazit I immediately killed the other brother Prince Yakup). He prepared to rebel to gain the post. While his father was occupied with suppressing the rebellions, Savcƒ± saw his chance to revolt. Using the royal treasury under his disposal, he formed an army. The two rebellious princes, well aware of one another's interests, decided to collaborate and combined their forces.Prof.Ya≈üar Y√ºcel-Prof Ali Sevim:T√ºrkiye tarihi II, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1991, p 16Joseph von Hammer: Osmanlƒ± Tarihi Vol I (condensation: Abd√ºlkadir Karahan), Milliyet yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul. p 20  End of the rebellion  After learning about their sons' joint rebellion, Murat and John returned from Anatolia. The armies of the fathers and the sons met in Apikridion (an ambiguous location probably southwest of Constantinople), where Murat persuaded Savcƒ±'s soldiers to switch sides.Nicolae Jorga: Geschiste des Osmanichen vol I, (trans: Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli) Yeditepe Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 2009, , p 235 Although the princes escaped to Didymoteicho (in modern Greece), they soon surrendered. After a short exchange, enraged Murat blinded Savcƒ±. However, he changed his mind and had him executed. Although he asked John V to also blind his son, John was more merciful towards Andronikos and only blinded him in one eye. Andronikos went on to become the Byzantine emperor as Andronikos IV Palaiologos.Lord Kinross: The Ottoman Centuries, (Trans. by Nilifer Ep√ßeli) Altƒ±n Kitaplar, ƒ∞stanbul,2008, p.49  Aftermath  Savcƒ±'s son Davut fled to Hungary.

He was a consistent supporter of the Italian unification ideals that would lead to the Italian Risorgimento shortly after his death. Biography =Childhood and education= Francesco Melzi d'Eril was born to Gaspare and Marianna Teresa d'Eril in 1753. Despite the House of Melzi d'Eril being one of the prominent families in the Milanese aristocracy, their wealth had been compromised. This was mostly due to Francesco's grandfather Francesco Saverio Melzi, who had fought in the War of the Austrian Succession along with the Spanish, thus falling in disgrace when Empress Maria Theresa had re-established her control over her possessions in Lombardy. As a consequence of this situation, Francesco Melzi d'Eril was raised by his uncle. Francesco's uncle had him educated by the Jesuits, first at the \\"Collegio dei Nobili\\" in Brera and then at the \\"Scuole Palatine\\", both in Milan. In the latter institute, Francesco met scientist Ruggero Giuseppe Boscovich, who would thereafter be one of his best friends. In 1773, as a consequence of Emperor Joseph II's Enlightenment- influenced reforms, religious schools lost the right to confer degrees, so Francesco never graduated. =Entry into politics= Despite his family's situation, Melzi d'Eril had the opportunity to frequent exclusive Milanese circles, where he met prominent Lombard Enlightenment thinkers such as Pietro Verri, Cesare Beccaria, Giuseppe Parini, and Ippolito Pindemonte. He also had the opportunity to travel abroad and become knowledgeable about the emerging, Enlightenment-influenced European political systems as well as the English parliamentary system. In this context, he developed a liberalist view and sympathized for the French Revolution, although this was later mitigated by his disapproval of the radical, anti-religious developments the Revolution would bring about. He also thoroughly embraced the cause of the Italian unification. =Descent of Napoleon in Italy= Melzi d'Eril's attitude towards Napoleon was as mixed as that he had had towards the French Revolution. When Napoleon began his Italian campaign, and entered Milan, Melzi d'Eril first supported the new rule, participating in the government of the Cisalpine Republic. Later on, when he realized that Napoleon had no interest in the unity of Italy, Melzi d'Eril retired and eventually moved abroad. After the Battle of Marengo (1800), Melzi was invited to France to participate in the definition of the new political order for Italy. When the Italian Republic was founded, with Napoleon as the head of state, Melzi d'Eril was named vice- president. In the three years of the Italian Republic, Melzi d'Eril largely contributed to the development of the Republic as well as the renewal of the city of Milan, that was chosen as the capital of the new kingdom. Nevertheless, when the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in 1805, Napoleon chose Eug√®ne de Beauharnais as his governor, and Melzi d'Eril was somehow set aside from the new government. As a compensation of sorts, he was made Duke of Lodi. He thus retired, but remained a strong supporter of the autonomy of Italy and a frank critic of the Napoleonic rule. =Late years= In 1815, Milan fell under the Austrian rule. Melzi d'Eril was cautious in his relationships with the Austrian Empire, avoiding direct confrontation but also refusing to bow to the new rulers. It is notable, for example, that in 1815 he refused to welcome Austrian emissary Annibale Sommariva who had been sent on a diplomatic mission to meet him in his house in Bellagio. Melzi d'Erial died on 16 January 1816 at the age of 63, in his house in Milan (Palazzo Melzi d'Eril), while the Austrian Emperor was visiting the city. The newspaper did not report on his death, for fear that the news might cause uprisings in Milan while the Emperor was there. The very day of his death, his house was sealed by the police, and his documents were later sequestrated and brought to Vienna. The funeral was delayed until 28 March, but it was solemn and largely participated by the population. His body was buried in Villa Melzi d'Eril, his villa in Bellagio, on Lake Como.

A native of Wesel, Cleves, Nering was educated largely in Holland. From 1677-79 he also travelled in Italy. In 1682 Nering worked on the gate and chapel of K√∂penick Palace. He was appointed Oberingenieur (senior engineer) by Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg, in 1684. The following year Nering was appointed Ingenieur-Oberst (engineer colonel) within the General Staff. After Frederick III came to power in 1688, Nering was tasked with overseeing the drafts of 300 two-storied burgher homes in the new town of Friedrichstadt. He also planned the layout of the Gebdarmenmarkt and contributed to Sch√∂nhausen Palace. In K√∂nigsberg Nering designed the Burgkirche, constructed from 1690-96. Nering was appointed Oberbaudirektor (senior architectural director) for Brandenburg on 9 April 1691. He worked on Schloss Oranienburg (1690‚Äì94), the bridge Lange Br√ºcke in Berlin (1692‚Äì95), the Hetzgarten in 1693, and the Parochialkirche and part of the Zeughaus in 1695. Georg Heinrich Kranichfeld used Nering's design for Sch√∂nhausen Palace during the construction of Holstein in East Prussia. Nering also originated the design of the Zeughaus (arsenal) on Unter den Linden in Berlin in the year of his death; it was completed in 1730 and became the modern-day Deutsches Historisches Museum. Charlottenburg Palace, the royal residence of the Hohenzollern family in Berlin (finished 1713) In 1695, Nering began designing Electress Sophia Charlotte's summer residence, later known as Charlottenburg Palace, but he died during its construction. Although the palace was subsequently greatly expanded, the original central section became known as the Neringbau. The architect was also honored by having a street near Charlottenburg Palace named after him in 1892. References * *Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie.

Opened in 1957, it was the first major mall in the St. Louis area, and one of the first to have more than one department store. The mall previously included Macy's, Dillard's and Sears as anchor stores, all three of which were vacant before demolition began in May, 2016, resulting in a \\"dead mall\\". Demolition was finished in October 2017. Decline was first noticeable in the early 2000s, but took off seriously in 2006, when many stores started to close their doors. The announcement the Dillard's would close in August 2007 was critical, because it was the most popular store. Two years later, Macy's closed, which was considered the ultimate dagger. It was by then assumed that Crestwood Mall was not going to be around much longer, and that became official in September 2013, when the exterior Lens Crafters closed their doors. History Crestwood Plaza was the first regional mall in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Local retail developers Louis and Milton Zorensky developed the mall in 1957. Its original anchor stores included local department store Scruggs, Vandervoort and Barney (later Famous-Barr, then Macy's) and Sears, making one of the first major malls to have more than one anchor store, and the first to utilize a split- level parking lot to allow direct access to both floors of the anchors. The Zorenskys later developed a second St. Louis mall, Northwest Plaza, which opened in 1963. In 1967, Crestwood was expanded, adding Stix Baer & Fuller (later Dillard's) as a third anchor. The mall was the subject of a 1975 lawsuit related to a Kroger supermarket that formerly operated within it. The suit was filed after Kroger moved to a new store across the street in 1972 and subleased its space in the mall to Tipton Electronics. Mall owners wanted to terminate the lease with Kroger, but Kroger wanted to maintain the sub-lease. The suit ruled in Kroger's favor. Originally an open-air mall, Crestwood Plaza was enclosed in 1984. A Woolworth store at the mall closed in 1988, and was replaced by 18 smaller stores a year later. Westfield Group purchased Crestwood Plaza in 1998 and renamed it Westfield Shoppingtown Crestwood. The company sold two other St. Louis-area malls to CBL & Associates Properties in 2007, but did not include Crestwood in the sale. It had previously attempted to sell the mall to Somera Capital Management in 2006, but the deal was not completed. The mall was ultimately sold to Centrum Properties and renamed Crestwood Court. Also in 2007, Dillard's closed its store in the mall due to decreased sales. Famous-Barr had also announced plans to relocate to a new outdoor mall in Sunset Hills, but remained at Crestwood after the Sunset Hills development was canceled. The Crestwood store closed as a Macy's in 2009, leaving Sears as the only anchor. The loss of anchor stores resulted in increasing vacancies throughout Crestwood Court. Although Centrum initially planned to redevelop the center as a lifestyle center, it filled more than half of the mall with art-oriented tenants, such as art galleries and dance studios. Sears closed in April 2012 due to declining sales. As of late 2012, the only remaining tenant was a LensCrafters. The mall concourses were officially closed off on July 11, 2013, leaving only LensCrafters, which had an exterior entrance.http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/article_261c9ae1-b332-5462-bac0-57a060d33d0a.html On September 16, 2013, LensCrafters closed, leaving the mall completely vacant.http://sunsethills-crestwood.patch.com/groups/crestwood-court- redevelopment-news/p/crestwood-courts-final-tenant-leaves Redevelopment In Summer 2013, proposed redevelopment hit a snag when the Crestwood board of aldermen refused to take the bid from the redeveloper, Centrum Properties, and the project was considered abandoned. The property at that point was entirely vacant.http://sunsethills-crestwood.patch.com/groups/police-and- fire/p/multiple-vehicle-breakins-on-watson-road In April 2014 Urban Street paid $3.6 million for the Crestwood Court during an online auction.

The organization comprises the General Council of Official Medical Colleges (Consejo General de Colegios Oficiales de M√©dicos or CGCOM) and the Spanish regional medical colleges. Its role is to represent all the registered doctors, ensuring proper standards and promoting an ethical medical practice.  Responsibilities  The CGCOM is the governing body that coordinates and represents the 52 local medical colleges at national and international levels. Its role is to represent, organize and defend the medical profession. Within the General Council, there is a Permanent Commission that is in charge of its administration and management. It manages any plans or projects agreed by the General Assembly and it also deals with administration and management issues of the General Council and its Human Resources department. Currently there are five members of the Permanent Commission.  Organization  The General Assembly is the highest power within the CGCOM and it is constituted by all 52 presidents of the local Medical Colleges, the members of the Permanent Commission, the national representatives of the College sections, representative members of the University, the scientific societies and other medical institutions. These medical institutions will join in following invitation by the assembly and will have a say but no right to vote. The College sections are the different committees within each local College that get doctors together according to the modality of their medical practice. These committees are in charge of providing advice regarding their own specialties as well as organising suggestions or audits on the appropriate issues set up by nominated working groups. The national representatives of the different college sections are as follows: * Rural General Practice * Inner city General Practice * Dependent private practice * Independent private practice * Doctors with poor employment contracts * Doctors in public administration * Hospital doctors * Training doctors * Retired doctors = Departments and Trusts = Organizaci√≥n M√©dica Colegial de Espa√±a ; General working groups: * Working group on ethics, medical law and working permits * International issues * Technology * Working group on organization rules * Working group on budgets * Working group on news release and the OMC journal * Working group on nursing prescription * Working group on violence against doctors * Working group on terminal care and 21st century medical ethics * Area of relationship with non-medical professionals * Area of relationship with Patients Associations * Area of relationship with non-traditional-medicine practitioners * Area of relationship with the University * Area of relationship with the pharmaceutical industry * Area of relationship with business companies * Area of relationship with medical insurance companies * Area of relationship with scientific societies * Medical harm evaluation board * New technologies working group.

It also publishes audits, documents and reports of general interest for the medical profession.  History  In 1875, King Alfonso XII signed a law that made it compulsory for doctors working in Madrid and other Royal Places to be part of a register. This eventually became the basic structure for the creation of the medical colleges. The first Spanish medical colleges were formally established in 1894. Compulsory registration for all doctors was debated between 1898 and 1900 but wasn‚Äôt established till 1917. From 1893 there was a growing need amongst the medical profession to create a professional association and with this in mind, the local colleges were founded. The general organization of Medical Colleges (Organizaci√≥n M√©dical Colegial or OMC) was created soon after. A school for orphans of medical parents (Colegio Principe de Asturias) was founded on May 15, 1917. In October 1918, a first attempt to get the Heads of the Colleges to meet together had to be canceled due to the flu epidemic at the time; the unsuccessful date was chosen to coincide with a Medical National Meeting. It wasn‚Äôt until January 1919 that representatives from 33 local colleges finally met in the first ever general assembly. During that historic meeting they discussed issues such as pensions for the relatives of all those doctors deceased during the flu epidemic and also general issues about the medical profession. They created an executive committee based in Madrid and led by Dr Augusto Almazara and they agreed to meet again later on. The Medical College of the city of Valencia requested an assembly of Spanish Medical Colleges and this was organized on 6 November 1920. On this date the Federation of Spanish Medical Colleges was founded creating a National Directory. Dr. Jos√© Sanch√≠s Berg√≥n, first President of the OMC in Spain. During the next several years the Federation evolved to establish some formal rules when it came to sanction doctors or to settle disagreement between the administration and the Colleges. In January 1930, a General Assembly took place in Barcelona and it was chaired by Dr Perez Mateos. During this meeting a project to study the country medical needs (Proyecto de Previsi√≥n Nacional) and the statute were signed off. At this point, the General Council of the Medical Colleges becomes the absolute leader to organize a link between regional Colleges, public administration, official organizations and the registered doctors. From this date it becomes the only accepted official institution that represents doctors in Spain. At the very beginning of the Spanish Civil War, in July 1936, the Ministry of Work and Health dissolved the existing Colleges organization. By 1937, the Republic had constituted the Association of Medical Professionals and by August, the general Government had created a Permanent Commission that reported directly to the Health General Headquarters. After the war in 1940 and under the dictatorship of General Franco, new laws for the functioning of the General Council of the Medical Colleges were instituted. In 1946 a new set of internal rules was established including 22 deontological principles. Then in 1963 the rules of the Council were renewed introducing some fundamental changes. Under the new rules, the assembly was composed of the Presidents of each of the local colleges rather than by a representative group of their members. A voting system was introduced so that the registered doctors themselves could choose their representatives, who could then choose the members of the General Council.Libro de Actas de la Organizaci√≥n M√©dica Colegial. Madrid. 1963 The term Organizaci√≥n M√©dica Colegial was adopted as the name of this organization. By 1967 the official state document announced that the OMC is a guild within public law and is fully independent from the Health Administration.Orden de 1 de abril de 1967 por la que se aprueba el nuevo texto del Reglamento de la Organizaci√≥n M√©dica Colegial. BOE. 1967/05/13; (114):6396-412. The arrival of democracy in Spain brought intense political changes. In 1980 some new medical statutes were approved; the main novelty being that the representatives of the sections within the colleges had their right to voice and vote, and furthermore, all registered doctors can take part in general elections to choose the members of the Council. It becomes compulsory for every College to have its own named ethics group. Further changes were introduced during the following years (2006‚Äì2010) which have greatly changed the organization. The most remarkable ones have been the tasks and responsibilities of the Autonomy Groups, the incorporation of medical students to the organization, the incompatibility of jobs within the Permanent Commission and the time limit to the responsibility posts. The aim remains to update the General Council to the reality of the current medical profession. The organization was responsible for several public awareness efforts during the 2009 flu pandemic in Spain.

The church, now a listed building, was built between 1695 and 1703. It is the oldest church in Berlin built as a Protestant place of worship. The church is now used and owned by the congregation of St. Mary's and St. Peter's, the merger of the parishes in the historical city center concluded on 23 September 2005. The congregation forms part of the Evangelical Church Berlin- Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia, a Protestant regional church body comprising Lutheran, Reformed and united Protestant congregations. Name When the prince-electoral family of Brandenburg, the Berlin-based Hohenzollern, converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism (in German usually: Reformed Church; in English mostly: Presbyterian church) in 1613, all parish churches of Berlin, then under the patronage and advowson of the Lutheran city council, remained Lutheran. So only the C√∂lln Palace and Collegiate Church, the court church, was dedicated as a Reformed place of worship. However, mainly by immigration the number of ordinary German-speaking Berliners of Reformed denomination, not employed at or belonging to the court, grew and a separate parochial church for them, as opposed to the Palace Reformed Church, was needed. Parochialkirche was the first and then only Reformed church for prevailingly ordinary Reformed congregants in Berlin, thus the undifferentiated name. As a Reformed church building Parochialkirche is not dedicated or even consecrated to any patron saint.

In 1946 a makeshift floor was built from the porch into the church, which could not be structurally secured until 1950-1951. Fritz K√ºhn made a cross from scrap iron found in the ruins, which was hung in the sanctuary in 1961. The last religious service took place in the building on 20 August 1961 and for the rest of the East Berlin-era the building was used for exhibitions and concerts and then (from 1970) as a furniture warehouse. A new roof was put on in 1988. From 1991 onwards the building was gradually restored. Works on the porch and tower were postponed in 2001 and on the nave in 2004. In summer 2016, the bell tower dome with the golden sun was restored after 72 years and the carillon with 52 bells has been rung since 23 October 2016 from the Parochialkirche's 65 m tower.Parochialkirche - The oldest church of the Reformed Protestant community in Berlin Cemetery The church's cemetery is one of the oldest surviving ones in Berlin and includes the tomb of the Reformed theologian Daniel Ernst Jablonski.

Nexus was formed in 2010 after a merger agreement between the former members of Distant Thunder Show Corps and Equinox Drum and Bugle Corps (both of Bedfordshire). Nexus have their rehearsal base at Sandye Place Middle School, Sandy, Bedfordshire. For their inaugural season Nexus competed in the British Youth Band Association (BYBA) circuit. In 2011, Nexus also joined the Drum Corps United Kingdom (DCUK) circuit, where they have competed every year since. Nexus have also enjoyed competition in European shows from 2012. Nexus competed in Division Three for their first BYBA season and since were promoted to Division Two for 2011 after becoming Division Three Finals and National Champions. However, in 2011, Nexus have decided to move to Associate Class in BYBA and Open Class in DCUK.

He won the 1914‚Äì15 Southern League title with for Watford, and captained Wolverhampton Wanderers in the 1921 FA Cup Final. Early and personal life Gregory was born in Pinner, Middlesex on Valentine's Day 1888, leading to him being christened Valentine. Val was the third son of Fred Gregory, a tenant farmer at Pinner Hill Farm, and later the licensee of Oddfellows pub in Pinner. He joined Watford three months after his elder brother, also named Fred, and at one stage he, Fred, and younger brothers Allan and Owen were all contracted to Watford simultaneously, although only he and Fred went on to play for the club competitively. Career After starting his career in amateur football with Pinner Football Club, Gregory joined Watford as a professional in December 1911. He made his debut on 25 December, in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Luton alongside elder brother Fred. His first goal followed shortly after, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Exeter City on 30 December 1911, and by the end of the 1911‚Äì12 season Val had made 16 Southern League appearances, scoring twice. He established himself as a first-team regular over the following two seasons, missing only five of Watford's 84 games. Watford narrowly avoided relegation in the 1913‚Äì14 season with an 18th- placed finish, but Gregory and Watford started the following season with a nine match unbeaten run. He played only three of their next ten matches, coinciding with six Watford defeats over the same period. From 25 December onwards he was ever-present, and Watford secured the Southern League title on the penultimate game of the season, with Fred scoring the title-winning goal in a 3‚Äì2 win against Gillingham. Normal peacetime competitions were suspended between 1915 and 1919 due to the First World War. In this time, Gregory made 43 wartime appearances for Watford, and also made guest appearances for Arsenal. The Southern League resumed in 1919‚Äì20, which proved to be Gregory's last season at the club. He made 35 appearances and scored twice, but Watford lost out on the title to Portsmouth on goal average. In May 1920, Gregory joined Football League side Wolverhampton Wanderers for what was at the time a Watford record transfer fee of ¬£1,500. He was joined by former Watford teammate George Edmonds, the top scorer from the title-winning season. Despite being a Second Division side, Wolves overcame Stoke City, Derby County, Fulham, Everton and Cardiff City to reach the 1921 FA Cup Final. Gregory captained his team in the final at Stamford Bridge, but they were defeated 1‚Äì0 by Tottenham Hotspur. Gregory spent the remainder of his professional career at Wolves, making his final appearances for the team in the 1922‚Äì23 season that saw the club relegated to the third tier. He became a player-coach in 1925, and finished his playing days as an amateur for Butler Sports and Wolverhampton Football Club. He finally ended his service as a coach at Molineux in 1938 due to ill health. Later life and death After retirement, Gregory remained in Wolverhampton, and once refereed a charity match held at Molineux, Wolverhampton Wanderers' home. He died in March 1940 in Wolverhampton, aged 52.

It is located north-northeast of Madera, California. It was closed in 1966. History Madera AFS was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 774th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at the new station on 27 November 1950, and assumed the coverage of a temporary \\"Lashup\\" site at Fort MacArthur (L-43) operating an AN/TPS-1B radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The squadron began operating AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars from Madera AFS in January 1952. In 1958 the height-finder radar was replaced by AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-6A radars. In 1959 an AN/FPS-20 search radar superseded the AN/FPS-3. In 1960 the Air Force upgraded an AN/FPS-6A to become a -6B. During 1961 Madera AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-18 at Beale AFB, California. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 774th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 January 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In August 1963, the SAGE data feed was reassigned to DC-17 at Norton AFB. The Air Force upgraded the search radar, first to an AN/FPS-20A, and then to an AN/FPS-66. By 1963 this AN/FPS-66 search radar operated in conjunction with AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars, and on 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-74. Reductions in ADC funding led to Madera Air Force Station being inactivated on June 25, 1966. Today, the site remains largely intact, although at some point, the radar towers had been removed. When the station was shut down, it was handed over to a Native American group which operated the property as a vocational technology center. The site was sold off to someone else & used for unknown purposes, and then the current owner bought it in the late 1980s or early 1990s.

Life  Wilhelm Jordan as a student in K√∂nigsberg Jordan was the son of the pastor Charles Augustus Jordan and attended gymnasiums in Gumbinnen and Tilsit. From 1838 he studied theology at the University of K√∂nigsberg and became a member of the Corps Littuania. His university friends included the liberals Rudolf von Gottschall and Ferdinand Gregorovius ‚Äì Jordan and Gregorovius read out the poem of welcome on behalf of the student body at the ceremony of homage for the king and queen of Prussia. Thrilled by Feuerbach and Hegel, Jordan gave up his preacher course and switched to philosophy and the sciences. After graduating Doctor of Philosophy at the Albertus-Universit√§t (1842) he moved to Berlin to work as a writer. In 1843 he was convicted of liberal anti-Christian writings and moved from Berlin to Leipzig, where in 1845‚Äì46 he worked for the magazine Die begriffene Welt. He was expelled from Leipzig in 1846 for his political activities and moved to Bremen, where he worked for the Bremer Zeitung, becoming its foreign correspondent in Berlin and Paris. From 18 May 1848 to 20 May 1849 he was the liberal member for Freienwalde in the Frankfurt Parliament, which he called the \\"great university of my life\\". There he joined Heinrich von Gagern and called for a greater German Empire led by Prussia. For this reason, in a speech on 24 July 1848 in a debate about the 'Drang nach Osten', he argued against restoring an independent Polish nation state and against supporting the Polish struggle for independence. Poles, he claimed, would soon join Russians and \\"life and death\\" struggle would ensue with GermansDefining Germany: the 1848 Frankfurt parliamentarians and national identity, Brian E. Vick, page 192, Harvard University Press 2002 On this matter he called for a \\"gesunden Volksegoismus\\" (a healthy Volk-egoism), which quickly became a buzzword for his opponent Robert Blum and was also developed into the \\"national egoism\\" advocated by the Polish nationalist Roman Dmowski.

Jordan was also on the Marinerat in the Reichshandelsministerium (Reich trade ministry) and worked on building a national fleet. After his retirement, he went on many lecture tours, popularising the Nibelungenlied among other things - one of these took him to the US in 1871. On his eightieth birthday his birthplace of Insterburg made him an honorary citizen. Publications Signature as Dr. Wilhelm Jordan His literary works are rooted in 19th-century historicism and profoundly influenced by Ludwig Klages and his school friend Theodor Lessing. His plays, poems and novels are dominated by philosophical and scientific ideas. His main work was his Nibelungen-Epos, written in Stabreim (alliterative verse) - in it, he used the Old Norse saga of the same name and the Lay of Hildebrand as his main sources but subjected the action to a time-related psychological interpretation. In the 19th century he was often seen (in the words of Ren√© Simon Taube) as \\"a precursor of Nietzsche and pioneer of Darwin in Germany\\". Today his work is little-known, except for his 'mysterium' Demiurgos and his translation of the Elder Edda, both still in use due to their sensitive language and epic depth.

She appeared in the show on/off between 1978 and 1998. Entertainment career She began her career as an entertainer in British nightclubs during the 1960s and 1970s. She collaborated and became friends with many well-known English actors and comedians in the clubs, including Lynne Perrie, Pat Phoenix, Liz Dawn, Freddie Starr and Les Dawson. =Acting credits= Palmer joined the cast of Coronation Street in 1978, portraying machinist Ida Clough. Her son, David Palmer, told the Bridlington Free Press in 2011 that he was unsure how she came to be cast in the show, but she joined the series about the same time as Lynne Perrie and others whom she worked with in the clubs. Palmer's character appeared opposite other high- profile characters on the show, including Ivy Tilsley and Vera Duckworth. Palmer remained a regular cast member on the show until 1988, when Ida Clough was fired by Mike Baldwin (portrayed by Johnny Briggs) for reporting him for drunk driving. Palmer's Ida Clough returned to the show in 1995 for the funeral of Ivy Tilsley, played by Lynne Perrie. Palmer made her last appearance on Cononation Street in 1998. Her other credits included Days of Hope, Spend, Spend, Spend and the 1979 film, Yanks. Her last appearance as an actor was in the comedic series, Stan The Man, in which she played the wife of actor Eric Sykes' character. Personal life Palmer and her husband, Alex Palmer, were both originally from the West Riding of Yorkshire. The couple, who worked in the licensed trade in addition to her career as an entertainer, purchased a home in the East Riding village of Sewerby in the 1970s with the intent to move there during their retirement. In 1986, they moved to the nearby seaside resort of Bridlington, where they began operating the Nag's Head pub in Market Place. They ran and lived at the Nag's Head until Alex retired in 1990, at which time they moved to Sewerby. Death Palmer died on 5 January 2011, at Scarborough General Hospital in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England at the age of 82 after a brief illness. She is survived by her husband, Alex, and her son, David Palmer. Her funeral was held on 18 January at St John the Evangelist Church in Sewerby. Her son David died by suicide in 2018. At the time of his death he was being investigated by police over the murder of his partner.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester- news/son-coronation-street-legend-thought-14739305 References External links *Obituary in The Guardian * Category:1928 births Category:2011 deaths Category:British television actresses Category:English television actresses Category:English film actresses Category:English soap opera actresses Category:English stage actresses Category:English businesspeople Category:People from Bridlington Category:People from Bolton upon Dearne Category:Actresses from Yorkshire Category:20th-century English actresses ","title":"Helene Palmer"},{"id":"30625600","text":"Chrysolina oricalcea is a species of broad-shouldered leaf beetle of the family Chrysomelidae, subfamily Chrysomelinae.

Background The Church of St Peter is found at the west end of the village of Letwell, near Rotherham, in South Yorkshire. The church was built around 1375 by John Mauleverer,Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council website, taken from 'A Patchwork of Parishes', 1997 but has been substantially altered several times.Heritage Inspired website Much of the church was later rebuilt in 1820, at the expense of Henry Gally Knight FRS, the owner of Firbeck Hall, but was largely destroyed by fire a few decades later. The church today consists of the 14th century tower with a Victorian nave and apse. It is Grade II* listed. 1867 Fire The tower, along with the vestry are all that remain of the church following a fire which occurred in 1867. The fire was inadvertently started by one Harry Radley, who was sexton at the time. In response to complaints from the parishioners that they were too cold, he had over-stoked the coal-fired boiler which led to the fire.Bailey, D. 'A Visitor's Guide to the Parish of Firbeck with Letwell and Woodsetts' (2002) The church was re-built and decorated in its current form at the expense of Sir Thomas Woollaston White, 2nd Bt., the son of the famous soldier Sir Thomas White, 1st Baronet of Tuxford and Wallingwells, who twice raised the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry Cavalry at his own expense. Much of the decoration in the church was contributed by Sir Thomas' daughters. Organ The church is unusual as it still uses a harmonium instead of an organ. The harmonium, dating from the 19th century, was constructed by the Estey Organ Company of Brattleboro, Vermont. Churchyard The churchyard is a designated Grade III Botanical site. Current use It is part of the Diocese of Sheffield, now under the joint Benefice of St Martin, Firbeck, with St Peter, Letwell and St George, Woodsetts and holds worship every Sunday, alternating Matins and Evensong.

It is found in tropical humid forests in South America, where its range includes the Amazon, the Guiana Shield, Trinidad, and the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil. It formerly included T. chionurus of the Choc√≥ region as a subspecies, but under the common name white-tailed trogon (a name now reserved for T. chionurus).Remsen, J. V. (2008). Recognize Trogon chionurus as a separate species from Trogon viridis. . South American Classification Committee. Accessed 25 January 2011. Description Female with abnormally dark bill This relatively large trogon is long.Restall, R. L., Rodner, C., & Lentino, M. (2006). Birds of Northern South America. Christopher Helm. (vol. 1). (vol. 2). As most trogons, it is strongly sexually dimorphic. In the male the head and upper breast are dark blue (appears blackish in poor light), and the back is green. The lower underparts are orange yellow. The wings are black, vermiculated with white. The undertail is black and white: Each feather has a broad black base and a broad white tip and outer edge.Ridgely, R. S., & Greenfield, P. J. (2001). The Birds of Ecuador ‚Äì Field Guide. Cornell University Press. The complete eye-ring is pale bluish. The female green- backed trogon resembles the male, but has a grey back, head and breast, and distinct black-and-white barring mainly to the outer webs of each tail feather. For comparison, the similar but smaller violaceous trogon has a yellow (male) or incomplete white eye-ring (female), and the male also has barring to the undertail. There is no overlap in the distribution of the green-backed and white-tailed trogons, but the two can be separated by the undertail pattern: Unlike the green-backed trogon, the male white-tailed trogon only has a very narrow black base to each feather (the undertail appears almost entirely white), and the female mainly has black-and-white barring to the inner webs of each feather (can be difficult to see). The male white-tailed trogon also has a bluer rump than the green-backed trogon. The song of the green-backed trogon consists of about 20 cow notes that start slow, but accelerate towards the end. The song is slower than the white-tailed trogon, and higher pitched than the black-tailed trogon. Ecology They typically perch upright and motionless. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. Their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Green-backed trogons feed mainly on small fruit, supplemented by arthropods - slightly more so in the dry season when fruit are scarce, but even then they seems to be among the most frugivorous trogons in their range.Pizo, M. A. (2007). The relative contribution of fruits and arthropods to the diet of three trogon species (Aves, Trogonidae) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Revista Brasileira de Zoologia 24(2): 515-517. They are consequently more rarely seen to attend mixed-species feeding flocks than other trogons.Machado, C.G. (1999). A composi√ß√£o dos bandos mistos de aves na Mata Atl√¢ntica da Serra de Paranapiacaba, no sudeste brasileiro. Revista Brasileira de Biologia 59(1): 75-85. It is a resident of humid tropical forests, and it typically is the commonest trogon in its range. It nests in a termite nest or a hole in a rotten tree. The nest is usually if not always built by the female which excavates an upward-sloping tunnel ending in a breeding chamber.Cisneros-Heredia, D. F. (2006). Notes on breeding, behaviour and distribution of some birds in Ecuador. Bull. B.O.C. 126(2): 153-164. The nesting season is apparently mainly during the summer months (June‚ÄìAugust). The clutch is typically two or three white eggs. These are incubated for 16‚Äì17 days, with a further two weeks to fledging.

It was based in the Bolton in Greater Manchester, England. The company produced large steam-driven engines for textile mills in Lancashire and elsewhere. History The firm started as Knight and Wood, having premises at the Victoria Foundry in Garside Street, Bolton. The name changed around 1860 to James and Edward Wood. J & E Wood engines were characterised by having a neat appearance, the valve gear was beneath the cylinders. From 1875 on, they only used Corliss valves.  The Mutual Mill Engine  On 7 September 1893, one of J & E Woods 1892 engines in Mutual Mills, Rochdale was extensively tested by Mr J L F Crosland and the results published. The engines were triple expansion with four cylinders arranged in a horizontal double tandem formation. The high pressure (HP) cylinder had a bore of , the intermediate pressure (IP) cylinder had a bore of and the two low pressure (LP) cylinders . The stroke was and the engine operated at 53 rpm. The engines were fitted with Corliss valves operated by a simple proprietary trip motion. The piston rods for the HP and IP are and . During the test, the two by Lancashire boilers with 3 ft 2 in diameter flues produced steam at 156 psi. There were Galloway tubes in the flues and behind the boilers was an economiser with 288 pipes. Water was delivered to the boilers at . The boilers were fed by mechanical stokers using coal known as Shaw slack with a calorific value of 12,963 Btu/lb. During two days of testing the engine developed power of 1089.7 and 1049.4. The power developed on the two sides of the engine was balanced being 542.2 IHP and 547.5 IHP. On the two days 1.37 lb/IHP hr and 1.38 lb/IHP hr. Taking into account that coal could be bought at 6s/ton- this means that 1d would buy 23.1 IHP hrs or 5544 IHP hrs per pound sterling. For a thermal efficiency point of view, of the 14935 Btu of heat supplied, 2545 Btus were converted into mechanical work. This is an efficiency of 0.172 while a perfect engine gives 0.279, Theoretical Carnot Cycle Efficiency, so the engine has a relative efficiency of 0.616. This is taken as the reference standard for an engine of this configuration.

She was born in Streetly, Staffordshire, England and studied piano privately and horn at the Birmingham Conservatoire (formerly the Birmingham School of Music) before reading music at Birmingham University, graduating with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1960.Master of Arts [Birmingham University] 1968 After completing her studies, she took a position teaching music with the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Her music has been performed internationally. She is one of the women pioneers in electronic music composition in Great Britain for her earliest musique concrete pieces belong to the late 1950s. Daphne Oram was helpful and encouraging here. The influences on her music are diverse and include non-European music as well as the sounds of nature and industry. The use of music technology allowed her to make sonic explorations and the use of microtonality. These influences also enriched her writing for acoustic instruments as in \\"Study of the Object no V\\" (1970) for unaccompanied voices, a graphic score she calls sound sculpture, \\"Mestra\\" (1979‚Äì80) for solo flutes and \\"Hunting Horns are Memories\\" (1977) for horn and tape for which she worked out quarter tone fingerings for the F/B flat double horn. How time passes is also intrigues her and she has experimented with polymetric and polytempi music. Janet Beat is included in the British Music Collection archive at Heritage Quay, Huddersfield. She is an Honorary Research Fellow of the School of Culture & Creative Arts at the University of Glasgow and an Affiliate of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery as a Curatorial Consultant. Works Beat composes for instruments, electronic music for tape alone and also for acoustic instruments with tape or computer. She has written for orchestra, chamber ensemble, theatre and film.

It was used to refer to the Republican machine in the 1920s run by William Hale Thompson, as when TIME magazine said, \\"to Mayor Thompson must go chief credit for creating 20th Century Politics Chicago Style.\\"TIME (1931) online The phrase has often been used to refer to the Democratic Party-dominated machine, or \\"boss,\\" politics of Chicago during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Political scientist Harold Gosnell wrote the most detailed analysis in Machine Politics: Chicago Style (University of Chicago Press, 1937). Paul E. Peterson extended the term to cover School Politics, Chicago Style (University of Chicago Press, 1976). Paul Kleppner looked at ethnic politics in the city in \\"Mayoral Politics Chicago Style: The Rise and Fall of a Multiethnic Coalition, 1983-1989.\\" National Political Science Review 5 (1995): 152-180. The term has been used by critics of the administration of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley,Nicola Mann, \\"The Death And Resurrection of Chicago's Public Housing in the American Visual Imagination,\\" Doctoral Dissertation, University of Rochester, 2011. *\\"Unlike other U.S. cities like New York City, Chicago never benefited from a reformist Mayor such as Fiorello LaGuardia. Instead, for the past forty-five years, Chicago has been beholden to the so-called Chicago- style politics of Richard J. Daley and his son Richard M. Daley. This one- party/one-family made the city vulnerable to corruption...\\"John N. Kotre, The Best of Times, the Worst of Times: Andrew Greeley and American Catholicism, 1950-1975. and to Chicago's history of political corruption more generally. More recently, the phrase was used by Republican Party politicians and activists during the 2008 presidential election and 2012 presidential election campaigns against Barack Obama, who had lived in Chicago since 1985. The phrase has also been used in recent years to characterize a supposedly offensive ‚Äútough, take-no-prisoners approach to politics‚Äù. Origins and meaning Journalists Chuck McCutcheon and David Mark have described the phrase Chicago politics as a reference to the \\"unsavory and even corrupt\\" aspects of politics in Chicago, and noted that in the heyday of the Chicago machine, this included patronage, nepotism, and \\"activities that regularly drew the attention of federal prosecutors.\\" According to McCutcheon and Mark, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's tenure as mayor \\"is often considered Chicago- style politics at its worst.\\" The term Chicago-style politics was often used as a shorthand for political corruption. In 1970, for example, historian Humbert Nelli suggested in a historical profile of early twentieth-century mafia boss Anthony D'Andrea that Andrea had possessed all the qualities necessary to excel at \\"Chicago-style politics\\" - namely, the need to be \\"cynical, vicious, corrupt, pragmatic and well connected with criminal elements.\\"Nelli, H, \\"Anthony D'andrea's first and last hurrah,\\" Chicago Tribune, December 6, 1970. Nelli had been referring to the politics of Chicago around 1910, but the phrase was also used to describe contemporary Chicago politics during the 1970s. In 1977, for example, Chicago Tribune reporter Stanley Ziemba described \\"charges of corrupt patronage systems, mob influence, and political clout and reprisals\\" as the hallmarks of \\"Chicago-style politics\\" while reporting on civic elections in Chicago's suburbs.Ziemba, S., \\"Crime, cronyism: New suburb issues,\\" Chicago Tribune, April 17, 1977. Reporters have often used the term in this way since the 1970s. In 2003, for example, Seattle Weekly editor David Brewster, said that \\"Chicago-style politics\\" were \\"coming to Seattle\\" in reference to a local scandal over campaign contributions, defining the phrase as \\"this whole muscling-the- opposition, reward-your-friends and punish-your-enemies, tough-guy politics.\\" Use in 2008 and 2012 elections According to McCutcheon and Mark, the phrase Chicago-style politics took on \\"new resonance\\" in the political campaign advertisements of Republican presidential candidate John McCain when Democratic US Senator Barack Obama of Chicago, Illinois ran for President in 2008. For example, McCain's political campaign said Obama practiced Chicago- style politics, implying corruption. Republican presidential primary candidate Mitt Romney introduced the phrase into the rhetoric of the 2012 presidential campaign when he described a recess appointment by President Obama as \\"Chicago-style politics at its worst.\\" Romney supporters used \\"Chicago\\" as an epithet and referred disdainfully to \\"Chicago-style politics.\\" According to Jacob Weisberg of Slate magazine the phrase was \\"mainly\\" a way for Mitt Romney to \\"call Obama corrupt without coming out and saying so\\". The Chicago Tribune characterized the refrain as an attempt to discredit Obama through \\"guilt by geography,\\" saying \\"...Chicago has seen a goodly share of high- and low- profile officials and operatives shipped off to prison over the decades, and Republicans would like to prod voters into thinking that some of that dirt surely must have rubbed off on Obama.\\" Drake University professor of political science Dennis Goldford, an expert on presidential politics, suggested that Republicans were using the phrase to imply that Obama was a product of an outdated large urban political organization based on unethical behavior and the use of force.

Painting by Anton Wilhelm Tischbein Johann Christian Senckenberg (28 February 1707 - 15 November 1772) was a German physician, naturalist and collector. Senckenberg was born in Frankfurt am Main. In 1763 he established the Senckenberg Foundation to support natural sciences. This founded the Botanischer Garten der Johann Wolfgang Goethe- Universitat Frankfurt am Main. His name is honoured in the Senckenberg Gesellschaft f√ºr Naturforschung (Senckenberg Natural History Society) which he endowed, Frankfurt University Library, and Naturmuseum Senckenberg.  Life  Johann Christian Senckenberg was born on 28 February 1707 in the Frankfurter Hasengasse in the house \\"Zu den Drei Kleine Hasen\\". He was the second oldest son of the Frankfurt city physicus (Physikus primarius, medical officer) Johann Hartmann Senckenberg (1655-1730) and his second wife Anna Margaretha born Raumburger (1682-1740). He attended the municipal school in the former Franciscan mendicant in 1719. When Senckenberg was twelve years old, Senckenberg House was burned down in the Gro√üer Christenbrand, which was the worst fire disaster in Frankfurt until the Second World War. The reconstruction of the house brought the family into financial difficulties. Although Senckenberg was granted a 100 guilders scholarship through the city four years later, his studies were delayed due to the financial situation. In the meantime, Senckenberg worked as an intern lead doctor (Leitarzt) with the Solms noble family and with Frankfurt doctors B√ºttner and Grambs. His father instructed him in practical medicine. In 1730 he was able to study medicine at the University of Halle. His teachers in Halle included Friedrich Hoffmann and Georg Ernst Stahl. In July 1731 he had to stop studying in Halle. The deeply religious Senckenberg was impressed by the theologian Johann Konrad Dippel and became involved in theological arguments and refused Eucharist. He had turned away from the state church and was in contact with pietists, inspirational communities and members of the Moravian Church (Herrnhutern). In Halle, he encountered the charitable institutions of August Hermann Francke, including an orphanage and a hospital. Senckenberg returned to Frankfurt in the spring of 1732 and practised medicine there without a license. After he had suffered from mental problems, his older brother Heinrich Christian Senckenberg helped him in 1737 to obtain his doctorate at the Georg August University of G√∂ttingen. Under the chairmanship of Albrecht von Haller, he dealt in his dissertation with the healing power of the Lily of the valley (De lilii convallium eiusque inprimis Baccae viribus.: \\"On the healing power of the berries of the Lily of the valley\\"). In the following years, Senckenberg became involved as \\"Physicus extraordinarius\\", from 1755 as \\"Physicus ordinarius\\" for the health service in Frankfurt. After the death of his mother in 1740, Senckenberg married the jeweller's daughter (Joh-)Anna Rebecca Riese in 1742. In the same year he resigned the B√ºrgerid. The two had been neighbours as children and had known each other ever since. On 26 October 1743, Riese died of childbed fever following the birth of their daughter. The daughter Anna Margarethe Senckenberg died in 1745 from meningitis. Senckenberg remarried in 1744. His second wife, Katharina Rebecca von Mettingh, had been a friend of Senckenberg's first wife. She died in 1747, as did a son that was born in June 1747 (tuberculosis). In 1754, Senckenberg married a third time. However, the marriage with Antonetta Elisabetha Ruprecht was not good, and from 1756 they lived separately. Ruprecht suffered from cancer. Senckenberg also treated her after the separation, but she died in late 1756. After the death of his three wives and his children, he decided to make his entire fortune available in a Foundation pro bono publico patriae. Senckenberg called the reason for the Foundation the \\"lack of marital heirs\\" and his love \\"for my fatherland\\". The purpose of the Foundation should be the \\"better health care of local residents and the care of the poor.\\" The endowment of 95,000 guilders came partly the legacy of Anna Rebecca, and partly from the fortune he had earned as a doctor. Senckenberg stated that a \\"Collegium medicum\\" comprising Frankfurt Protestant physicians were the heirs of the Foundation's assets, and that four city doctors were to be testament executors. Two-thirds of the interest on the Foundation's capital was to be used to promote medicine, although initially it was to be used for the entertainment of the Senckenbergische Wohnhaus, which was equipped with a library and a collection. The remaining third should be used to care for needy doctors and patients. In 1765, Senckenberg increased the Foundation assets to 100,000 guilders. He strongly limited the board of trustees and gave his older brother and his descendants a say in the Foundation's administration. The Foundation became called Senckenbergische Stiftung and took as seal the coat of arms of the Senckenberg family: a burning bush. Senckenberg already had plans to build a building on the outskirts with garden, laboratory, botanical garden and greenhouse. In 1766, Senckenberg acquired a three-hectare plot of land at Eschenheimer Tor for 23,000 guilders. From 1767 the building became the foundation seat and residential building of Senckenberg. On 9 July 1771, Senckenberg laid the foundation stone for the Frankfurt B√ºrgerhospital. During an inspection of the building on 15 November 1772, Senckenberg crashed down from the scaffolding of the dome of the hospital and died. On 17 November, he was publicly dissected in the \\"Theatrum anatomicum\\" donated by him, even though he had refused a dissection in the will. The cause of death was a cervical spine fracture with ascending bleeding in the spinal canal. Senckenberg's nephew, Renatus Karl von Senckenberg, noted in a report on Senckenberg; \\"All of Frankfurt regretted his loss\\". On 18 November 1772, Frankfurt surgeons accompanied by Renatus of the Senckenberg Foundation, as well as administration and other mourners, carried the coffin to the Senckenberg tomb on Stiftsgeb√§ude. Senckenberg kept diaries during his studies. A total of 53 diary volumes and 600 folders with further notes are now in the Frankfurt University Johann Christian Senckenberg Library. There are 40,000 pages in total. Due to the hard-to-read handwriting (a mixture of Frankfurt German, Latin, Greek, French and English), as well as numerous idiosyncratic abbreviations, reading and transcribing these diaries is very difficult. Since 2011, Frankfurt University Library has been working on bringing some 13,000 diary pages from the years 1730 to 1742 into a readable form and making them available online as digital copies.

History It dates back to the first millennium, and is situated on the banks of the River Derwent to the south of Duffield, Derbyshire, England. It is the parish church of Duffield, and is associated with the nearby church of St Paul's in Little Eaton. In times past, the Parish of Duffield was much larger than it is now, covering the area known as Duffield Frith. The church's distance from the centre of the village is thought be because it was next to Duffield Bridge, which was used by pilgrims and other travellers.Bland.J., (Circa 1900) Notes on Duffield Church, a paper read before the Church of England Men's Society, Duffield Branch. Derby: J.H. Hall The church is Grade I listed. The current building dates from the 14th century, but was restored in 1847 by James Piers St Aubyn and in 1896‚Äì97 by John Oldrid Scott. Its weathercock was installed in 1719 by ironsmith Robert Bakewell. The church is in a joint ecclesiastical parish with St Paul's Church, Little Eaton, which was formerly part of Duffield Frith. Bells During the restoration of 1887, the peal of eight bells was augmented to ten by a gift from Sir Arthur Heywood, 3rd Baronet. St Alkmund's is one of only a few churches outside the larger centres so endowed. Organ The church has a pipe organ by Cousans dating from 1972.

Jordan was interviewed by Pennsylvania State Police twice that day and arrested before sunrise the next morning. The Lawrence County District Attorney's Office initially filed the charges in adult court because that is required in Pennsylvania homicide cases, regardless of a defendant's age. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office then took over prosecution of the case. After Brown had spent more than three years in a juvenile detention facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, while Pennsylvania courts deliberated his status, Brown was tried as a juvenile and found guilty of being delinquent by a judge on April 13, 2012. On May 8, 2013, the Superior Court vacated the finding of delinquency, citing \\"palpable abuse of discretion\\" and sent the case back to juvenile court. On July 18, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his conviction in a 5‚Äì0 decision. The justices attacked the evidence as insufficient and said that the juvenile trial evidence pointing to a shotgun in Brown's bedroom as the murder weapon supported an equally-reasonable conclusion that it was not the murder weapon. Brown could have faced a life sentence without parole if he had been tried and convicted for murder as an adult, but he faced custody in a secure juvenile detention center until he reached the age of 21 because he was only 11 when the crime occurred. He was granted transfer of his case into the juvenile court system. Incident Kenzie Houk was eight months pregnant when she was shot in the back of the head while she was sleeping in bed in their western Pennsylvania farmhouse. Both she and her unborn son died as a result of the attack. Houk's 4-year-old daughter alerted nearby tree cutters roughly 45 minutes after Jordan Brown and Houk's 7-year-old daughter got on a school bus. The state Attorney General prosecutor asserted that Houk was killed by a youth-model Harrington & Richardson 20-gauge shotgun, a Christmas gift to Jordan from his father. Pennsylvania State Police found a spent shotgun shell near the path Brown walked with Houk's older daughter to get to their school bus. He was subsequently arrested. Controversy The human-rights organization Amnesty International opposed the effort to try Jordan as an adult, citing the mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole penalty as a violation of international law. A petition signed by nearly 4,000 people protested what it termed as denial of Brown's fifth and sixth amendment rights. On weekends Jordan hunted alongside his father, Chris Brown, who purchased the youth-sized 20-gauge shotgun that state police believed was the murder weapon. The youth's father did not publicly discuss the case, until after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exonerated his son nine years later in July 2018. Legal proceedings Jordan Brown was initially charged as an adult. Presiding Judge Dominick Motto of the Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, Common Pleas Court initially denied decertification and transfer to juvenile court because Jordan would not admit his involvement in the crime. After Pennsylvania's Superior Court ruled that Judge Motto violated Brown's Fifth Amendment rights, Judge Motto recused himself from the case, and Judge John W. Hodge granted the decertification petition and ruled that Brown should be tried as a juvenile. The decertification ruling transferred Brown's case from adult court to Lawrence County's family court division regularly presided over by Judge Hodge, who handled the subsequent juvenile adjudication and dispositional hearings. Then what became an issue was whether Brown's eventual adjudication hearing (juvenile court trial) should be opened to the public, and whether he should provisionally be released while a decision in that matter was pending. Judge Hodge held that Brown's juvenile hearing would not be open to the public or to the news media. The Pennsylvania Superior Court rejected an appeal by three area newspapers (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and New Castle News) to overturn Hodge's ruling and open the hearing to the public. After those newspapers decided not to pursue their appeal further, Judge Hodge was directed by another panel of the Superior Court to move swiftly to hold an adjudication hearing. Judge Hodge ruled that Jordan would not be released pending that hearing. Following three days of testimony and legal argument, Judge Hodge issued his ruling on April 13, 2012, that Brown was responsible for first degree murder in the death of 26-year-old Kenzie Houk and of homicide in the death of her unborn male child. Judge Hodge adjudicated the now-15-year-old Jordan Brown to be delinquent (the juvenile court equivalent of a guilty verdict). Judge Hodge would announce Brown's disposition (the equivalent of a juvenile sentence) at a later date. Under Pennsylvania law, an adjudicated juvenile offender cannot be held in custody past his 21st birthday. Brown could be held in a juvenile rehabilitative treatment facility only until he turned 21 in August 2018. After his February 21, 2009 arrest, Jordan was placed in the Lawrence Country Jail, a facility for adults. But authorities transferred him to a juvenile center in March 2009 after his attorneys argued that the adult jail with its three cell blocks couldn't accommodate an 11-year-old boy. On June 13, 2016, more than seven years after his arrest, Jordan Brown was released from juvenile custody, two months before his 19th birthday. Judge Hodge put Brown on probation in the custody of an uncle who lived in Ohio, just across the border from Lawrence County. He was to remain on juvenile court probation until he turned 21. His lawyers continued to file appeals in order to have his juvenile conviction (adjudication) overturned. Two years later that resulted in the July 18, 2018 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling. Possible retrial On May 8, 2013, Superior Court, in the second appeal that came before it in this case, ruled that \\"the juvenile court committed a palpable abuse of discretion in rendering a ruling that is plainly contrary to the evidence\\" and vacated the juvenile court's disposition of delinquency. The ruling in particular objected to the assumption, made by the juvenile court, that no one else but Jordan could have shot Houk. Judge Hodge issued a juvenile court opinion on April 19, 2015, again finding that Jordan was the individual who killed Kenzie Houk and her unborn child on the morning of February 20, 2009. His disposition order was dated May 18, 2012. And again a third appeal was taken to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. In a split panel decision dated September 1, 2016, titled In re J.B. III, 147 A.3d 1204 (Pa.Super. 2016) (‚ÄúIn re J.B. III‚Äù), the Superior Court affirmed the juvenile court, and rejected claims that the juvenile court had improperly reassessed the evidence and made new credibility determinations in ruling on Brown's post-dispositional motions. A certiorari request for review was made to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which granted an appeal to consider Brown's claims that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the adjudication of the juvenile court, and that its adjudication was against the weight of the evidence.  Conviction overturned  On July 18, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his conviction in a 5‚Äì0 decision. The two Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices who did not participate had previously ruled in Jordan's favor on his earlier appeal while they had served as judges in the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The justices attacked the evidence as insufficient and said that the juvenile trial evidence pointing to a shotgun in Brown's bedroom as the murder weapon supported an equally-reasonable conclusion that it was not the murder weapon. Justice Debra Todd wrote the Court's opinion and noted, \\"The Commonwealth‚Äôs evidence was, therefore, insufficient as a matter of law to overcome Appellant‚Äôs presumption of innocence, and the juvenile court‚Äôs adjudication of his delinquency for these serious crimes must be reversed.\\" The last words of the opinion then ordered that \\"Appellant is discharged.\\" Double jeopardy has attached under the Fifth Amendment, and Brown, now 21, cannot be retried. Another possible suspect is Adam Harvey, an ex-boyfriend of Houk. Houk had a restraining order against Harvey because he had threatened violence against her.  Current life  Brown is currently a college junior studying computer science. He has repeatedly stated in interviews that while he suffers from PTSD, he is committed to turning his life around.

Distances are to scale, but the galaxy images have been enlarged for your viewing pleasure. The Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey is a project to exploit the latest generation of ground-based wide-field survey facilities to study cosmology and galaxy formation and evolution. GAMA will bring together data from a number of world class instruments: * The Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), * The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) * The Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) * The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) * The Herschel Space Observatory * The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Data from these instruments will be used to construct a state-of-the-art multi- wavelength database of ~375,000 galaxies in the local Universe over a 360 deg2 region of sky, based on a spectroscopic redshift survey on the AAT's AAOmega spectrograph. The main objective of GAMA is to study structure on scales of 1 kpc to 1 Mpc. This includes galaxy clusters, groups, mergers and coarse measurements of galaxy structure (i.e., bulges and discs). It is on these scales where baryons play a critical role in the galaxy formation and subsequent evolutionary processes and where our understanding of structure in the Universe breaks down. GAMA's primary goal is to test the CDM paradigm of structure formation. In particular, the key scientific objectives are: * A measurement of the dark matter halo mass function of groups and clusters using group velocity dispersion measurements. * A comprehensive determination of the galaxy stellar mass function to Magellanic Cloud masses to constrain baryonic feedback processes. * A direct measurement of the recent galaxy merger rates as a function of mass, mass ratio, local environment and galaxy type. In August 2012 GAMA received worldwide attention for its announcement of a galaxy system very similar to our own Milky-Way Magellanic Cloud system, centred on GAMA202627.

It is an urban pageant offering a yearly cash prize, entertainment contracts, and scholarship assistance to the winners. The pageant's focus is to spotlight the modern urban woman and to promote women in business. History American Siren was launched by Invision Filmworks in January 2011 as a recruiting tool for new faces in the entertainment industry, keeping inline with the principles of presenting more positive images of minorities and urban life. The pageant was created as a solution to the exploitation and controversy of hip hop models and so called video vixens; providing positive representations of the morals and values of minority and urban women instead of the more common negative, degrading, subservient, or misogynistic images popularly portrayed. The pageant's intention is to showcase the \\"urban woman\\" in a new light by combining the world of entertainment with the world of business thus giving young women not just positive new role models but educating them of the many career options available despite the preconceived prejudices toward beauty. Competition The competition is open to all women over the age of 18. Entry requires contestants to submit an essay and to sign an honor pledge see honor code.

On the top floor of the three storey atelier-house the memorial room for the Hungarian artist Amerigo Tot can be found.  History  In the post war period the gallerist Gy√∂rgy Koller (1923‚Äì1996) founded the Association of Hungarian Engravers (‚ÄúRMAK‚Äù)in 1953. Because quality and authenticity of the artworks were always his top priority, the association became soon well known in the Hungarian art scene and art market ‚Äì especially because the artists were granted much more freedom and personal support than they could expect from the government. In 1980, the first private gallery of Hungary was opened in the atelier-house of the Hungarian-Italian sculptor Amerigo Tot. From that time on the Koller Gallery was authorized to present not only graphics, but also sculptures and paintings. Already in the year 1984, an exhibition- and sell room was established in the Hungarian National Gallery, which underlined the cooperation with the institution. Additionally, an exhibition room was opened in the S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi street as well as in the Hilton Hotel in the Castle District. Thus, Hungarian art could be presented to a broader public. The organisation of exhibitions abroad, as f.e. J√°nos Kass in London, Imre Varga in Venice, Vienna, Basel and Paris or Mikl√≥s Melocco in Hamburg, also enhanced the good reputation of Hungarian contemporary art. Gy√∂rgy Koller, the founder of the Koller Gallery, died in 1996. In the year 2006, the grandson of Gy√∂rgy Koller became the managing director of the Koller Gallery. The aim of the gallery still is to represent Hungarian and international modern and contemporary art. After a period of modernisation, the gallery successfully organised numerous exhibition in Hungary and abroad. Sculpture garden of the Koller Gallery  Represented artists  From the beginning, the gallery represented contemporary artists, especially engravers and graphical artists as f.e. Mikl√≥s Borsos, Lajos Szalay, J√°nos Kass, Vladimir Szab√≥ and Gyula Hincz. The Koller Gallery also represents modern and contemporary sculptors such as Mikl√≥s Borsos, Imre Varga, Mikl√≥s Melocco and P√©ter P√°rk√°nyi and modern and contemporary painters, such as Istv√°n Sz≈ënyi, Istv√°n Cs√≥k, Bertalan Por, Istv√°n M√°csai and among the young artists G√°bor Szenteleki and M√≥zes Incze, just to name a few. The gallery also offers art appraisals and services for art collectors.  Amerigo Tot memorial room  The Koller Gallery can be found in the former atelier-house of the Hungarian-Italian sculptor Amerigo Tot. To bear tribute to the artists, a permanent memorial room and exhibition has been opened in fall 2010. And the Galerie Arte too.

Marriage Johanna of Baden-Durlach was born in the Karlsberg, Durlach, the third child of Friedrich VII Magnus, Margrave of Baden-Durlach (1647‚Äì1709) and his wife Auguste Marie of Holstein- Gottorp (1649‚Äì1728). In 1697, she was married in Baden-Wurttemberg in a double-wedding to Duke Eberhard Ludwig of W√ºrttemberg (1676‚Äì1733).Wilson, p. 229. His parents were Duke Wilhelm Ludwig of W√ºrttemberg and Magdalena Sibylla of Hesse-Darmstadt. The couple tied the two leading Lutheran dynasties of southern Germany together. Joanna's marriage was celebrated in Switzerland, where Baden's court stayed in exile due to repeated French invasions. Two months later in Stuttgart, the marriage of Eberhard Ludwig's sister, Magdalene Wilhelmine and the crown prince and later Margrave Charles III Wilhelm of Baden-Durlach was celebrated. Eberhard paid little attention to his new wife; allegedly he only married her in order to be near one of Joanna's ladies-in- waiting.  Separation  After a son, Crown Prince Friedrich Ludwig (1698‚Äì1731), had been born in the first year of marriage, the couple lived largely separated. Through his military career Eberhard Ludwig initially stayed rarely in Stuttgart. In 1704, he took part in the Battle of Blenheim, and was later appointed commander of the Army of the Rhine. In 1707, he became Field Marshal of the Swabian troops in the War of Spanish Succession. It was important for him to command a standing army and a great role model and lead to an absolutist French state with a brilliant court. Johanna Elisabeth clung on to Pietist ideas of morality, with which she had been brought up, and stayed in the old castle in Stuttgart.  The Gr√§venitz affair  Eberhard Ludwig of W√ºrttemberg was the first Duke who lived openly with a mistress, Wilhelmine von Gr√§venitz (1686‚Äì1744). His morganatic marriage to her 1707 was considered a scandal. On the application of Johanna Elisabeth to Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, the bigamous marriage had to be dissolved and Gr√§venitz was sent into exile in Switzerland.Wilson, pp. 230- 233. Her spouse returned in 1710 when Wilhelmine of Gr√§venitz, through a sham marriage to Hofmeister Count von W√ºrben, was able to return to W√ºrttemberg as well.Wilson, p. 234. They lived largely in Ludwigsburg. In 1718, the residence was also officially moved to Ludwigsburg. Johanna Elisabeth, meanwhile, continued to live in the Old Palace in Stuttgart. She refused, however, to file for divorce, and the marriage was not dissolved. The early death of Prince Friedrich Ludwig in 1731 threatened to move W√ºrttemberg to a Catholic secondary line. Because of this danger, Duke Eberhard Ludwig broke his connection to Wilhelmine of Gr√§venitz and hoped to conceive an heir from his legitimate and long-ignored wife, Johanna Elisabeth. The advanced age of the couple and the imminent death of the Duke on 31 October 1733, however, thwarted these efforts. Johanna Elizabeth survived her husband by more than twenty years. She lived as a widow at Kirchheim Castle, and died in Schloss Stetten, Stetten in the Rems Valley. She was buried in the Ludwigsburg Castle Church.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Lugia first appeared as a central character in the film Pok√©mon: The Movie 2000, The Power Of One, and later serves as the version mascot of the video game Pok√©mon Silver and its remake, Pok√©mon SoulSilver, appearing on the box art of both, and appearing in-game. It later appears in the Pok√©mon anime, various merchandise, spin-off titles and printed adaptations of the franchise, such as Pok√©mon Adventures. In animated appearances, Lugia is voiced in Japanese by Koichi Yamadera and in English localizations by Eric Rath. Within the world of the Pok√©mon franchise, Lugia are strongly associated with the sea and the element of water in general, in contrast to Ho-Oh, the version mascot of Pok√©mon Gold and Pok√©mon HeartGold, which is associated with the element of fire. As a Psychic-type and Flying- type Pok√©mon, Lugia possesses multiple psychic abilities, such as telepathy, and can fly, but also possesses abilities related to water. Lugia has received positive reception from critics. Design and characteristics Considered a legendary Pok√©mon within the setting of the games, Lugia is characterized as the \\"Diving Pok√©mon\\" in the Pok√©dex and the latter states that Lugia is known as \\"The Guardian of the Sea\\". It has been more often compared to a dragon, bird, wyvern or sea monster, 1UP.com calling it a \\"sleek, draconic creature\\". The Hartford Courant described Lugia as resembling a \\"flying white lizard\\", adding that its wings more closely resembled \\"huge cartoon paws\\". They are primarily pale silver-white, but have blue undersides with slightly varying tones. They have a somewhat beak-like, ridged mouth, although they have teeth on their lower jaw. Their head has a point to the back, and their eyes have pointed blue spikes on them. Lugia have long slender necks and their bodies are smooth and covered with streamlined feathers, with the exception of dark blue or black spike-like protrusions which run down the length of their back, and two smaller ones on the ends of their tails. They have large wings that resemble hands, similar to a personified bird wing. Lugia possess the ability to calm storms and are said to appear when storms start. They are also said to be able to spawn a storm lasting as long as 40 days by flapping their wings. A light flutter of a Lugia's wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to blow apart regular houses. Lugia are highly intelligent, and isolates itself at the bottom of the sea, where it tends to slumber in solitude at the bottom of a deep oceanic trench, in order to avoid accidentally causing damage with the devastating power it packs. Appearances =In video games= In Pok√©mon Gold and Silver and Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, a Lugia plays the role of a powerful legendary Pok√©mon that lives at a far-off location and has to be caught or defeated by the player. It can be found in the depths of a sea cave located at the Whirl Islands, a group of isolated islands surrounded by whirlpools. In these games, the player must obtain an item called the \\"Silver Wing\\", in order to catch that Lugia. A Lugia is one of the main characters of Pok√©mon XD: Gale of Darkness. The storyline of the game depicts an evil Lugia, known as \\"Shadow Lugia\\", terrorizing the locals and wreaking havoc. Among other things, this variant is said to be the ultimate shadow Pok√©mon. The player has to catch and purify it for it to return to its original, normal state. A Lugia is also featured in the Super Smash Bros. series from Melee onwards, where, when released from a Pok√© Ball, will fly up and unleash its signature Aeroblast attack. It may also periodically emit its signature cry. Following connectivity issues at the first Pokemon Go Fest, all attendees were provided with a Lugia in game. =In other media= In Pok√©mon: The Movie 2000, a Lugia, voiced by Eric Rath, arises from the sea when the three legendary birds Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres are roused by a Pok√©mon collector who tries to catch the trio. Lugia then battles the raging birds and, with the help of Ash Ketchum and Team Rocket, manages to calm them and restore peace to nature. In the anime, a young Lugia named Silver makes an appearance when the protagonist, Ash, travels to the Whirl Islands where he meets a friend of his, named Ritchie, to help stop a Team Rocket scientist from separating Silver from its parent, another Lugia. Lugia also appeared in Pok√©mon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages. In Pok√©mon Adventures, the Elite Four tried to exterminate humans using a Lugia in the Yellow chapter. The Masked Man apparently caught a Lugia twice to get an item called \\"Silver Wing\\", but both times Lugia went back to the wild, along with Ho-Oh. Lugia most recently appeared in Pok√©mon the Movie: The Power of Us. Promotion and reception The Telegram & Gazette stated that attempts to merchandise the character were poorly received, namely due to lack of familiarity on the part of consumers with the character. September 2000 saw Lugia-themed Chrysler PT Cruisers touring the United States and visiting IGN offices to promote the games Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, Hey You, Pikachu!, and Pok√©mon Puzzle League. Lugia has had positive reception. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish praised the design heavily, calling it a \\"sleek, draconic creature\\" similar to Final Fantasy VIII rendition of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, and attributing the preference consumers had for Pok√©mon Silver over Pok√©mon Gold reflected in sales to its role as the game's mascot. Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Lugia the sixth best Legendary Pok√©mon and the fourth best Pok√©mon overall. They also called it a \\"gentle giant\\". IGN also ranked Lugia as the 4th best Pok√©mon, where the staff commented that\\" it's gone on to become one of the franchise's most iconic legendary creatures .Lugia - #4 Top Pok√©mon - IGN In contrast, the Daily Texan criticized Lugia as lacking the \\"human personality that make the other Pok√©mon so endearing\\", further adding that while it had an animalistic grace, the effect was ruined in the animated film by its voice.

Until 1920, stamp designs only showed pictures of the King and Queen and were primarily shown using typographic design. In 1921, a new series known as the and was specially printed to serve as additional postage for sending sea mail in waterproof iron chests. Stamps issued in later years began to show the culture and geography of the Indonesian archipelago. During the Dutch East Indies period, the stamps were printed in the Netherlands by the firm of Joh.

He is known to have been situated at Sirmium, spending his career defending the Byzantine Empire against the Avars. He might have been a magister militum per Illyricum. The main source about him is Menander Protector.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 241-242  Biography  Bonus is first mentioned c. 561, while in the service of Justin, son of Germanus. Bonus was tasked with defending the Danube limes against the Avars. He is mentioned at the time as a protostates (). His title might have been equivalent to a majordomo. He resurfaces in 568-570 as a general. His exact position in the military hierarchy is uncertain, but the location of his activities at Sirmium, while still being in charge of the Danube limes, suggests the position of magister militum per Illyricum. The spring of 568 found the Avars besieging Sirmium. Bonus was in charge of the defense within the walls and was wounded in combat. When negotiations started between the defenders and the besiegers, Bonus was initially unable to attend the meetings. The Avars started suspecting that their opponent was dead, forcing Bonus to appear to them in person. The Avars eventually agreed to lift the siege in exchange for a \\"gift\\" (payment). Bonus sought the approval from emperor Justin II. Months later, Bonus allowed an Avar embassy to cross Byzantine areas towards Constantinople. The negotiations at the capital failed. Justin II reprimanded Bonus for granting protection to an embassy that had clearly unacceptable demands. His message to Bonus also warned the general to prepare for renewed hostilities. In 569/570, Tiberius II Constantine, the comes excubitorum, instructed Bonus to guard the river crossings of the Danube once more. His subsequent activities are unknown. The 10th-century Suda lexicon preserves another fragment of Menander Protector concerning Bonus, though its context is left unclear. The passage has Bonus warning his men that the Avars use battle cries and the beating of the drums to unnerve their enemies. He instructs his forces to answer with battle cries of their own. The \\"Suda On Line\\" project translates the relevant passage (E, 2310): \\"The Avars in their battle-charge wanted to raise a confused and fierce noise, and along with their yelling to make a thud on their drums, so that the din would be raised so much that it would astonish and terrify the Roman army. Since Bonos knew this in advance, he forewarned the soldiers, so that they would not be dumbfounded by the melee, but imitating in advance what was going to happen, to be accustomed to what was to come by the similarity even before the event, and when they perceived the beating of the drums, they themselves would beat in return with their shields and shout the war-song and sing a paean and make a thump on the water-pots (which were made of wood).\\" E, 2310, Suda On Line, Translated by Catharine Roth (2007) See also *Bonosus  References   Sources  * Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine generals Category:Magistri militum Category:History of Syrmia Category:Medieval history of Vojvodina Category:6th century in Serbia Category:Avar‚ÄìByzantine wars ","title":"Bonus (Sirmium)"},{"id":"30626395","text":"The International Protein Index (IPI) is a defunct protein database launched in 2001 by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and closed in 2011.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church lies to the west of the village of Little Barford, overlooking the River Great Ouse, about south of St Neots. History The oldest fabric in the church is in the nave and the chancel and dates from the Norman era. Alterations and additions took place in the 14th, 15th and 19th centuries. The tower and the clerestory were built in the late 15th century. In 1834 a south chapel was demolished and it was replaced in 1869 by a vestry and organ chamber. This was part of a restoration carried out by Arthur Blomfield. The church closed in 1972, and two years later was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund (the forerunner of the Churches Conservation Trust). The church had been built to serve a medieval village which has since been deserted. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in cobbles with ashlar dressings. Some roofs are tiled, others are slated. The plan consists of a nave with a clerestory and a north aisle, a chancel with a south vestry, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with an embattled parapet, paired bell openings, and a five-light west window. The east window in the chancel consists of three lancets, and in the north wall of the chancel are two windows in 14th-century style. In the south wall of the nave are three windows; one at a higher level dates from the 16th century, the others are from the 19th century, one in 12th-century style, and the other in the style of the 14th century. The south doorway dates from the 12th century. It has a semicircular arch, is decorated with zigzag and dogtooth designs, and has scalloped capitals.

The game is loosely based on the 1985 film of the same name. A sequel, Back to the Future Part II & III, was released in 1990. Gameplay In the single mode game, the player controls Marty McFly through various stages set in 1955 in which he collects various clock icons in order to advance to the next level, and avoid the gradual vanishing of his future (indicated by a fading photograph at the bottom of the screen). If the photograph fades fully, Marty would lose a life as it would show him vanishing. Collecting 100 clocks restored the photograph to its full, unfaded status. Two power-ups can help improve Marty's control: bowling balls that can destroy enemies and a skateboard which can speed up gameplay. There are also three minigames at the end of each stage, featuring such scenarios as Marty repelling Biff Tannen's gang of bullies from a cafe, blocking all the kisses Lorraine sends Marty (in the shape of little hearts), and having to position his guitar properly to stay in tune at the dance in order for George and Lorraine to kiss. The gameplay on these stages is often compared to that of Paperboy. In the final stage, Marty gets to control the DeLorean time machine on the street at night, dodging lightning bolts and obstacles while accelerating in such a way as to reach precisely at the end of the stage, enabling the time machine to bring Marty home to 1985. The game only contains two songs from the film. One is a sped up version of \\"The Power of Love\\" which plays throughout most of the game; the other is \\"Johnny B. Goode,\\" which plays in the guitar level. If Marty loses all his lives, the player is shown a game over screen reading, \\"Tough luck Marty! It looks like you are stuck here.\\" The player is also presented with this message if Marty fails to get the DeLorean to 88 mph by the time he reached the wires, regardless of how many lives he has left.  Reception  Bob Gale, screenwriter of the Back to the Future films, has called the NES game \\"one of the worst games ever,\\" and even insisted in interviews that fans should not buy it. According to Gale, LJN refused his requests to give input while the game was being developed; once he was shown the game, he asked them to make changes, but was told it was too late in the process to change anything.

History Central Government through Ministry of Power in exercise of the power conferred by sub-section (3) of Sect 26 and sub-section (2) of Section 27 of the Electricity Act, 2003, by notification dt. 27 September 2010 in the Gazette of India notified that the Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (a Government Company) shall operate National Load Despatch Centre and the five Regional Load Despatch Centers, with effect from 1 October 2010. The subsidiary was set up on the recommendations of a government committee headed by G.B. Pradhan, additional secretary in the Union ministry of power. To make load despatch centres financially self-reliant and autonomous, the committee recommended independent and sustainable revenue streams. The move to separate the two functions is in keeping with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, which seeks to separate commercial interests from load management functions. The Pradhan committee report had recommended setting up a separate representative board structure overseeing the functions of the five regional load despatch centres (RLDCs) run by PGCIL‚Äîthe northern, eastern, north- eastern, western and southern regions at that time. The subsidiary was eventually made a separate company effective from 3 January 2017. Several steps were taken by Central Government and Regulators in formation of POSOCO. Some of the major milestones are listed below. ‚Ä¢ Pre 1994: RLDCs were operated by CEA with budgetary support from Govt. of India. ‚Ä¢ 1994-1996: RLDCs transferred in a progressive manner to POWERGRID.

POWERGRID transmission network failure  The Northern Region Grid, which provides power to nine states in northern India including Delhi, experienced a widespread outage due to a grid disturbance that occurred at about 2.35 a.m on 30 July 2012. Restoration work started immediately under the direction of CEO, POSOCO and POWERGRID's chairman & managing director. A team of engineers tried to find out a way for restoring the normal supply of power immediately, so that railways, Metro, airports and other power users deemed essential could get immediate restoration of electricity. With the coordinated efforts of the whole team of engineers and constituent state utilities, power supply to the essential services and other essential loads in northern India was restored by about 8.00 a.m. and about 60% of load of the Northern Region was restored by 11:00 am. This was possible by gearing up the power supply from hydroelectric sources and also extending power from the Eastern and Western regions for start-up supply for thermal generating units of the Northern Region. Thus the associated problems for want of power supply could be partially overcome by this time. Later, power supply was restored progressively and by 12:30 p.m. power was extended to most of the cities and towns through POWERGRID sub- stations. The Northern Grid was brought back to normalcy to meet the demand of about 30 GW at 7:00 p.m. On 31 July 2012, the northern grid collapsed for a second time, hours after the power supply was restored in the entire northern region following a disruption on the previous day. The eastern transmission lines also failed, disrupting power supply in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal, Assam and Punjab, among other states. Power Minister Veerappa Moily said that transmission grids will be independently audited in three months to ensure that the grids are fail-safe.

It was played between South Africa and Australia. The match ended in a tie after a run out between Allan Donald and Lance Klusener ended the match which resulted in Australia booking a spot in the final where they would defeat Pakistan. Background The two teams had faced each other in a Super six match, which would eventually prove to be the deciding factor in determining which of the two teams would qualify for the final. South Africa batted first and put up a competitive total, with Herschelle Gibbs scoring 101. In reply, Australia began losing wickets at regular intervals. The turning point of the match occurred when captain Steve Waugh was dropped by Gibbs at short mid-wicket, as Gibbs attempted to throw the ball up into the air in celebration, only for the ball to slip through his fingers. After the dropped chance, Waugh was reported to have famously said to Gibbs \\"You've just dropped the World Cup\\". Waugh denied saying this, but the quote has lived on in cricketing folklore.You've just dropped the world cup. ESPNCricinfo.com. Retrieved on 21-01-2012 Waugh went on to score an unbeaten 120 and guided Australia home by 5 wickets. Had Australia not won the game, they would have been knocked out of the World Cup. As it happened, the victory allowed them to finish in second place in the Super Six stage, and qualify to play South Africa in the semi-final. The match =Details= South Africa won the toss and elected to field. In seaming conditions, Australia managed to put up a total of 213 with Michael Bevan and Steve Waugh scoring vital half- centuries. Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald tore through the middle and lower order picking up 9 of the ten wickets between them. South Africa began their chase steadily with Kirsten and Gibbs putting on a good opening partnership. Wickets then fell at regular intervals as South Africa collapsed to 61-4. Jonty Rhodes and Jacques Kallis then put together a vital partnership taking South Africa within 40 runs of victory. Through some valuable runs from Mark Boucher and Pollock, and some big hitting from Lance Klusener, South Africa moved closer to the target =Final Over= South Africa entered the final over at 205/9, needing a further nine runs to win. The two men at the crease were Lance Klusener who was on strike and Allan Donald at the other end. Damien Fleming was the bowler. * 1st ball : Fleming bowled a full ball to Klusener who cover drove it away to the boundary for four runs. * 2nd ball : Fleming again bowled full but Klusener also hit this ball hard along the ground past Mark Waugh, who was standing at long-off, for another boundary. Klusener had made his way to 31 runs off just 14 balls and South Africa were now level, but they still needed one more run to advance into the final. On this delivery, Australian commentator Bill Lawry said \\"He‚Äôs hit it hard...that‚Äôs Mark Waugh down there, he won‚Äôt get it - they are level! South African commentator Mike Proctor then said \\"What kind of shot is that? That‚Äôs unbelievable, is he going to do it again for South Africa? He has done it on so many occasions. The first two deliveries of this over, he has gone bang, bang four, four - take that! Scores are level, South Africa need one to win to reach the final.\\" At that point, Bill Lawry reminded him that South Africa only had one wicket in hand and Australia would go through in the event of a tie. At that point, the Australian captain, Steve Waugh, brought his field up inside the circle to prevent a single being taken. * 3rd ball : The third ball saw Klusener mis-hit his shot to Darren Lehmann, who was standing at mid-on. Allan Donald was backing up a long way at the non-striker's end, and if Lehmann's close range throw at the stumps had hit, Donald would have been easily run out. Mike Proctor remarked \\"that could be the difference between a World Cup final or nothing.\\" * 4th ball : The fourth ball was similar to the third. Klusener mis-hit to Mark Waugh at mid off, but this time Klusener went for the run, even though the chances of a run out were high and there were still two balls remaining. Klusener sprinted down the pitch while Donald, at the other end, was watching the ball instead of his partner and did not hear the call to run. Waugh threw the ball to Fleming who rolled it along the pitch to Adam Gilchrist standing over the stumps at the batsman's end. Donald (who had dropped his bat) was run out by some distance for a diamond duck. Bill Lawry commentating on the final ball said, \\"There it is, this will be out surely - oh it's out, it's gonna be run out...oh, that is South Africa out - Donald did not run, I cannot believe it. Australia go into the World Cup Final - ridiculous running with two balls to go. Donald did not go, Klusener came - what a disappointing end for South Africa. What a match for our viewers right around the world.\\" Australia tied the match and went into the final against Pakistan. Legacy Australia went on to win the final at Lord's, beating Pakistan by eight wickets after bowling them out cheaply. They would then go on to win the 2003 and 2007 World Cups, and achieve a run of 34 World Cup matches without losing (which finally ended when they lost to Pakistan in the group stage of the 2011 World Cup). South Africa, on the other hand, maintained their trend of choking at the World Cup: in 1992 they had lost to England in the semi-finals when rain forced them to score 22 runs off the final ball, and in 1996 they had won all their group matches before losing to West Indies in the quarter-finals. The trend also went on to continue, as in 2003 as hosts, a Duckworth/Lewis miscalculation meant they tied Sri Lanka in their final group game at Kingsmead when victory would have seen them advancing to the Super Six. In 2015, they won their first knockout game against Sri Lanka and set co-host New Zealand a record World Cup knockout game chase target in their semifinal at Eden Park ‚Äì and it might have been bigger had rain not shortened the South African innings ‚Äì but miscues and the heroics of South African-born Grant Elliott undid them as New Zealand advanced to their first Cricket World Cup final. South African coach Bob Woolmer resigned after this match. In 2007, shortly before his death, he revealed that Donald and most of his team-mates were in tears after the result and put towels over their heads so no-one could see them. The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack opened its report of the match with: \\"This was not merely the match of the tournament: it must have been the best one-day international of the 1,483 so far played. The essence of the one-day game is a close finish, and this was by far the most significant to finish in the closest way of all - with both teams all out for the same score. But it was a compressed epic all the way through, and it ended in a savage twist.\\" In 2000, the match featured among CricInfo's 100 great matches of the 20th century. Steve Waugh called it \\"the best game of cricket I've played\\", while in 2004 The Sydney Morning Herald ranked it the 20th-biggest moment in Australian cricket. In 2010, The Times rated South Africa's choke in the final over as the second-biggest sporting choke of all time. In 2009, Shaun Pollock revealed that when betting at the Durban July horse race shortly after the match, he was told \\"Whatever you do, don't bet on number 10, he doesn't run\\", a reference to Donald not running (he was wearing jersey number 10). The twists, turns and close finish resulted in many observers regarding the match as the perfect One Day International from an entertainment perspective. The record-breaking ODI between Australia and South Africa seven years later, in 2006, continued the close rivalry between the two teams.

Bijoux Terner has over 35 years of experience designing, sourcing, and selling fashion accessories: watches, necklaces, pashminas, scarves, handbags, ties, and travel accessories. History Bijoux Terner was founded in 1974 by Salomon Terner in Miami, Florida. Terner, known as ‚ÄúMoni‚Äù, had left his native Cuba in 1960 after the government seized control of his family's business. In Cuba, Terner had been the president of the National Association for Handbag Manufacturers and, shortly after arriving in the United States, he launched a handbag manufacturing business of his own operating out of the basement of a local department store. Terner soon found success designing handbags for airline flight attendants. By 1965, his young business was supplying handbags to more than 80 percent of airline carriers and two of his handbags are on permanent display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. In 1974, Salomon Terner founded Bijoux Terner. Originally established strictly as a jeweler, the company soon began distributing custom designed jewelry at wholesale prices out of malls and merchandise marts. Before long, Bijoux Terner's aim expanded to include other fashion accessories as well. Salomon Terner's daughter, Rosa, decided to follow in her father's footsteps and joined the company. With the two of them at the helm, Bijoux Terner experienced steady growth over the next twenty years. The Bijoux Terner store in Miami International Mall in Miami, Florida, opened in late 2010. In 1997, Salomon and Rosa Terner decided to try selling all of the jewelry and accessories at an underperforming kiosk in Miami International Airport at $10. The location sold the merchandise five times faster than usual and, in just a few hours, had sold out. Realizing that the simple price point was perfect for travel customers who were in a hurry, the company began targeting the travel retail industry with a simple price point strategy. Bijoux Terner boutiques were opened in airports, on cruise ships, and eventually in casinos all around the world. In less than a decade, the company grew to over 400 locations in more than 25 countries around the world. Terner decided to sell the company and, in 2006, the Bahrain-based private equity firm Arcapita acquired Bijoux Terner for $90 million. Products When first launched, Bijoux Terner strictly offered jewelry goods. Since then, the company's product offerings have expanded to include bags and purses, textiles, travel accessories, and home goods. Within its categories, Bijoux Terner offers products such as watches, necklaces, earrings, pashminas, scarves, wallets, and handbags. The company also serves travel consumers offering goods such as travel pillows, chargers for electronics, and bedazzled headphones. The Simple Price Point Strategy began as an experiment at one of the company's locations. A Bijoux Terner kiosk at Miami International Airport had been underperforming and on the verge of closing. In a last-ditch effort, Rosa Terner decided to try to sell all of the store's products at $10. The experiment worked and the store sold five times more than usual and sold out in a matter of hours. The experiment led the company to introduce a simple price point strategy at all of its locations. In the United States, the company applied a $10 price to its products while, in Europe, they sold for ‚Ç¨12. Bijoux Terner's Global Reach. Bijoux Terner has over 650 locations in 50 countries around the world. Today, prices vary slightly depending on the market. The simple price point strategy has been an enormous success. Since its introduction, Bijoux Terner has grown 15 to 20 times its original size. Locations Bijoux Terner has over 700 locations in 50 countries around the world. Its headquarters are in Miami, Florida, where it also has its distribution center. The company has Sourcing and Quality Assurance offices based in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, as well as additional account support in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Manila, Philippines; and Zaragoza, Spain.

(Snail Games). It is published in the United States and Europe by its U.S. publishing division, Snail Games USA. It was released on November 27, 2010 in Europe.gamesindustry.biz In 2014 the European game service transferred from Webzen to Snail Games USA. Gameplay Players are first asked to choose one of four ancient civilizations to play as.Official site The choice is between the historical nations of Rome, Egypt, Persia and China. Each race has different benefits for a starting player, such as Rome‚Äôs units possessing higher than average health, or China‚Äôs construction time being shorter than average. Further civilization-specific units are found later in the game, like the Egyptian Anubis Chariot or the Persian War Elephant. After choosing and naming a character, players have the option to take a short tutorial to familiarise themselves with the game. Tasks are appointed to players throughout the game to guide them in learning the game‚Äôs mechanics and complexities. Players start with a small army and a high-quality hero to command them. Players start the game with a tiny settlement in the style of their chosen civilization from the character creation process, but are able to expand their territory, develop their city and build new settlements as the game progresses. Initially, within the starting city, there is only a Town Hall, a Barracks and a Civilian House. Through tutorial quests, players learn how to construct additional buildings, upgrade them, train units for their armies and research skills that will improve various aspects of their empire. Each building has a maximum level of 25, and requires progressively more time and resources to construct. There are five resources in Ministry of War from which construction flows: Food, Lumber, Stone, Metal, and Gold. The player's civilisation will accumulate these automatically within their borders, but their rate can be augmented through research and upgrades. Heroes are the second main element of the game next to building and upgrading one‚Äôs civilization. Heroes act as leaders in the player's empire. They are used to traverse the world map and can be used to plunder, tax and scout other cities. Furthermore, they are used in ranked arena battles and to conquer neutral territories. These heroes, in classic RPG style, can be levelled up through gaining experience points from battle and have an inventory full of slots in which to equip armour, weapons and accessories. The game features a persistent world. However, there are events that take place in instanced environments such as lair, arena and neutral city battles. Combat Combat is central to Ministry of War. Players are required to destroy NPC monsters and armies in order to gain items and experience for their heroes, to raid neutral territories and shrines, and to attack, or defend themselves from, other players.MMOReviews As heroes become more powerful, they are able to increase the size of their standing army and the strength of their troops. Heroes also possess unique skills that can give armies a boost in battle. Battles can be controlled manually by players, or they can choose to let them play out automatically; victory or defeat is decided upon through AI. A player can join or leave a battle at any point. Once combat begins, there is a brief waiting period during which players have the choice to command the combat themselves or to relinquish control. After this players will have 3 minutes to defeat their enemy. If an army is defeated, units can be retrained in one‚Äôs city but heroes themselves never permanently ‚Äúdie‚Äù. Gameplay goals There are a variety of goals for players to achieve depending on their gameplay style. One player may wish to possess the most territory of any civilization and thus will focus on expanding their influence through temples and worship. Other players may wish to ally themselves with a guild and conquer the most territory and plunder enemy cities. Still other players may wish to pit themselves one-on-one against players in the arena and achieve the highest ranking. Guilds Ministry of War requires the participation as a member of a guild to achieve any lasting conquests on the world map. Players joining a guild gain the ability to wage war on neutral territories, build new cities and campsites and campaign against the other civilizations. In the future, guilds will be able to vie for control of ‚ÄúFamous Cities‚Äù such as Berlin, Alexandria and Milan.

The railway station was an intermediate stop on the Kettering, Thrapston and Huntingdon Railway line that closed in 1959. The railway station was fairly inconveniently situated 1.75 miles from the town itself. At one time there were plans to extend the Wellingborough - Higham Ferrers branch to Raunds, but the plan was blocked by land owners. The Manchester, Sheffield & Lincolnshire Railway (the forerunner of the Great Central Railway) proposed a line from Doncaster to Raunds in an early version of its bid to build a trunk line to the capital. This line never came to fruition, and the company eventually built its London Extension via Nottingham, Leicester, Rugby and Brackley.

The upper level of the house holds the St. George's Historical Society Museum. The house is named for its architect, Walter Mitchell, who had it built in the 1720s. The museum is a replica of an 18th-century printshop, though its location was never formerly the site of such a business (it occupies the former servants' quarters of the Mitchell House). The museum is largely dedicated to the history of Bermuda's first newspaper and printing business, that of Joseph Stockdale, who published The Bermuda Gazette. Stockdale actually operated his business from the cellar of his own house, the Stockdale House, on Printer's Alley (currently a private home, belonging to present-day newspaperman Lt. Col. Gavin Shorto). Following his death, Stockdale's heirs continued to run operate the business from Stockdale House until relocating to Hamilton, Bermuda, following the capital's move there in 1815 (this led to a petition against the gazette, and the cancellation of subscriptions by many in St. George's, resulting in the closure of the newspaper). The Featherbed Alley Printshop was created, and is operated, by the Department of Tourism (DOT) of the Government of Bermuda. The Gutenberg press was obtained from a local printing business which had imported it some years earlier. Throughout the Nineteen-Eighties, the Curator of the museum was Major Donald Henry 'Bob' Burns, MC, famous also as the town crier of St. George's, and holder of the Guinness Book of World Records record for the loudest human speaking voice.POTSI (archived): Major Donald Henry 'Bob' Burns, MC.

While early efforts at systematic education were mostly in the form of private schools and academies, a public education system was founded during the Reconstruction era, by the biracial legislature led by the Republican Party. It was implemented by the late 1800s. Throughout its history, Mississippi has produced notable education inequalities due to racial segregation and underfunding of black schools, as well as rural zoning and lack of commitment to funding education. In the 21st century, Mississippi struggles to meet national assessment standards, and the state has low graduation rates. The Mississippi Legislature and Board of Education develop policies aimed at building better learning environments and standards in the classroom. In 2005, ninety-one percent of white students statewide were in public schools, and an even higher percentage of black students.Bolton, Charles C. The Hardest Deal of All: The Battle Over School Integration in Mississippi, 1870-1980. University Press of Mississippi, 2005, pp. 136, 178-179. , 9781604730609. Although unusual in the West, school corporal punishment is common in Mississippi, with 31,236 public school studentsPlease note this figure refers to only the number of students paddled, regardless of whether a student was spanked multiple times in a year, and does not refer to the number of instances of corporal punishment, which would be substantially higher. paddled at least one time. A greater percentage of students were paddled in Mississippi than in any other state, according to government data for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. Antebellum education Prior to the American Civil War, the elite arranged for private education of their children, founding private academies and schools. Some sent their children to the North (particularly Philadelphia, which had many Southerners) or England for education. The state government did not set a curriculum. Most children were educated at home for the skills they needed to help support their families. Funding for the few schools was left to private donations and student tuition. In Columbus, Franklin Academy for Boys was opened in 1821 as the first public school in Mississippi for white students. By 1830, only thirteen percent of white children were enrolled in public schools, and there was limited access to government-funded schools at the beginning of the Reconstruction. In 1918, Mississippi became the last state in the Union to require children to attend at least some schooling. Education in the Constitution Mississippi‚Äôs Constitution of 1868, drafted by a biracial convention, was the first legislation to provide for free public education for all children. The constitution established a ‚Äúuniform system of free public schools, by taxation or otherwise, for all children between the ages of five and twenty-one years.‚Äù Legislation was passed in 1870 that created school districts under the supervision of an elected State Superintendent of Education and appointed country superintendents, as well. Areas of a population with at least 5000 were permitted to establish separate school districts and extend the school term to seven months. The Constitution provided the following features in its legislation to establish a public education system: 1\\\\. Administration: the state superintendent of public education must be elected to provide ‚Äúgeneral supervision of the commons schools and the educations interests of the State.‚Äù A State Board of Education shall also be made up of the State Superintendent, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State. 2\\\\. School Term: The school year should also be at least four months. Any county that does not abide by the guidelines presented in the legislation should forgo its share of school funding and taxes. 3\\\\. Funding: The common schools were funded from a combination of revenue earned from the sixteenth sections lands, and an excise tax on alcohol, military exemption fees, and public and private donations specifically designed for public education. Such monies were invested in the United State bonds and the interest collected was allotted to support school systems. A poll tax was also levied to aid in funding education. By this time, the state was dominated by Protestant European Americans. The Constitution also states that public schools or their funds were not to be controlled by any religious group. It forbade conversion of public schools into Catholic parochial schools. African Americans and education Before the American Civil War, both enslaved and free African Americans had been prohibited by state law from receiving education. After the war, missionary groups in northern Mississippi helped establish schools to educate African-American youth. Some white supremacists tried to take control of the educational system, hoping to quell efforts to educate African Americans. The Constitution of 1868 did not direct integration of the new public school system, in part to gain support to establish it at all. The legislature determined that each individual school district could choose whether to have an integrated or segregated system. Superintendents of each county were told to divide the funds equally between white and black schools in the district, but black schools were historically underfunded. White schools were better constructed and were able to better serve the students academically. During the 1870s, education for blacks was further endangered as violence erupted in protest of the education of African Americans. At the same time, the government greatly decreased funding for public schools and the effectiveness of schools diminished. In 1886, state Superintendent J. R. Preston created a revised education code that slowly raised standards in the classroom. Teachers were paid more in salaries and were required to take teacher licensing exams. Leaders in education The Mississippi Board of Education, which currently has nine members, oversees education policy in the state. The Board appoint the State Superintendent of Education, sets public education policy and oversees the Mississippi Department of Education. Section 201 of the Mississippi Constitution states that the Mississippi Governor shall appoint one member from Mississippi‚Äôs Northern Supreme Court district, one member from Mississippi‚Äôs Central Supreme Court district, one member from Mississippi‚Äôs Southern Supreme Court district, one member who is employed as a school administrator, and one member who is employed as a public school teacher. Additionally, the Lieutenant Governor shall appoint two members-at-large, and the Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives shall appoint two members-at-large.

It serves the town and comune of Brenner in the autonomous province of South Tyrol, northeastern Italy. The station, situated at 1,371 m above sea, was opened in 1867 by the Austrian Empire's S√ºdbahn as a mountain pass stop along the Brenner Railway. In 1919, Brenner station came 300 m (980 ft) south of the border due to the annexation of County of Tyrol's territory by Italy from Treaty of Saint Germain-en-Laye (1919). The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). Italian train services to and from this station are operated by Trenitalia. Austrian train services, which use the platforms north of the station, are operated by √ñBB. Location The station is situated at Karl-von-Etzel-Strasse in the centre of town. History = County of Tyrol = Construction of the Brenner Railway between Verona (Bern- im-W√§lsch) to Innsbruck began in 1851 under the Austrian Empire's S√ºdbahn. On 25 July 1867, the section between Bozen and Brenner entered operation; the first train to leave for Bozen left Brenner at 8.05 am. Brenner station was officially opened on 24 August 1867, together with the remaining final section to Innsbruck. Some houses in Brenner had been destroyed to make room for a new area, long, for the station building and other rail infrastructure. The arrival of railway opened a new era for the village: it confirmed Brenner Pass, which has already been a major trans-Alpine crossing from the ancient Roman times, as the principal mountain pass for travellers and merchants. Moreover, the railway enabled more efficient movement of troops for the Austrian Empire to secure its southern regions of modern-day Veneto and Lombardy. = Transfer to Italy = On 26 April 1915, the Treaty of London promised Italy the territory south of the Brenner Pass (now known as South Tyrol), if the country switched its side to support the Entente powers against the Central Powers led by the German and Austro-Hungarian empires. On 10 November 1918, following the German Empire's call for an armistice, Italian troops moved up from Veneto and arrived at Brenner. The Treaty of Saint- Germain-en-Laye was signed with Austria on 10 September 1919. Under that treaty, the new border of Italy and Austria (Republic of German-Austria) moved to Brenner.Con.fine Brennero, Editrice Athesia, 2006, = Schengen passport- free zone = In 1992, Austria signed the Schengen Agreement and subsequently became a member nation of the European Union in 1995. Border and custom control posts at Brenner station have been removed.  Features  The passenger building is a modest, well-maintained three-storey structure. At ground level, it houses the ticket office, a waiting room and a station cafe. There are offices upstairs for both rail operators, Trenitalia and √ñBB, The station yard has a total of 12 through tracks: five of them are equipped with platforms and four terminating tracks with bay platforms. All of the platforms are connected by a pedestrian underpass. Another seven through tracks, which are not equipped with platforms, are used for overtaking and exchange of locomotives. All single system electric locomotives must be changed here at the border, since Austria and Italy use different electrical networks (15 kV AC at 16‚Öî Hz in Austria, 3000 V DC in Italy). However, the S√ºdtirol Bahn now operate on multi-system locomotives on their Bozen/Bolzano-Innsbruck through service.

The dual-track Brenner Railway was already running at full capacity as of the late 2000s; therefore, transport of freight by road has risen and consequently caused traffic congestion and air pollution, as Brenner Pass is the region's only major thoroughfare between Austria and Italy. The Brenner Base Tunnel, scheduled to be completed in 2025, would divert all freight rail traffic between Fortezza/Franzensfeste and Innsbruck via a tunnel underneath Brenner. Local traffic between Fortezza, Brenner and Innsbruck would continue with additional capacity being released on this railway section. The majority of freight traffic, as well as some passenger services, would make use of this tunnel. Journey time between Bozen/Bolzano and Innsbruck would be reduced from 2 hours to 50‚Äì55 minutes. Example of reduction of journey times (if passenger services are transferred to the Base Tunnel): *Bozen/Bolzano to Innsbruck - 2 hours currently; 50 minutes via Brenner Base Tunnel *Verona to Munich - 5 hours 20 minutes currently; 4 hours 10 minutes via Brenner Base Tunnel omitting Brenner station only Gallery File:FS 245 locomotive.jpgFS class 245 locomotive at the station.

Some are Christians, while others are Hindus. They have various sub-groups, among which are the Arrikars, Kantaikars, Magkars, Pagelkars and Ramponkars. Though they are largely involved in fisheries, Hence they have right of sacred thread. They are distinct from the Gabit community found mostly in northern Goa, although they share a similar traditional occupation. Found chiefly in the coastal talukas of Mormugao, Salcete and Tiswadi, the Catholic Kharvis generally speak the Konkani language but some use Portuguese. They write Konkani using Roman script. Arranged marriages are common but not prevalent, and monogamy is practised. The traditional joint family arrangements are increasingly giving way to the nuclear family. Their principal diet is rice and fish curry but meat and vegetables are also important constituents. While the Kharvis are traditionally a significant group among the fishing community of Goa, many of the younger generation have moved away from that occupation and also from the area. They are increasingly to be found working in Europe and the Gulf countries, from where they send money back to their families in India. The traditional modes of fishing in Goa have increasingly been supplanted by mechanised methods and the investment required for this, plus the gains to be accrued, have led to an influx of non- Kharvi communities to the industry. This shift to mechanisation has been encouraged by both the national Government of India and the state Government of Goa since the 1970s, and it had first become evident after the annexation of Goa by India in 1961. Those who remain in Goa as fishermen ‚Äî the women sell the fish ‚Äî operate in groups of around 25 people.

The temple, dating from the era of Medang Kingdom, sits in a narrow valley surrounded by paddy fields about two kilometers southeast of the Ratu Boko archaeological park on the east side of modern Yogyakarta. Further north is the Prambanan temple, and to the south are the Gunung Sewu hills, extension of Gunung Kidul hills.  Architecture  Banyunibo has a curved rooftop design crowned with a solitary stupa; this theme is unique among the surviving Buddhist temples of Central Java. The curved rooftop was either meant to symbolize lotus or padma petals, or meant to mimic the organic roof made from ijuk fibres (black fibres surrounding the trunk of Arenga pinnata) common in ancient Java vernacular architecture and also found today in Balinese temple roof architecture. The main structure was originally surrounded by stupas at ground level, the foundations of which can still be seen today. The stupas' foundations are arranged in a row of three stupas in south side of the temple, and three stupas on the east side. The northern side probably also contain the base of three stupas, however it still buried under a meter thick of earth. The main temple is facing west.Ancient Mataram Temple reliefs The stairs and the portal of the temple are adorned with typical Kala-Makara style, typical of ancient Central Javanese temples dated from this period. Makara is located on each side of the stair and Kala head is located on top of the portals. The niches surrounding the body of the temple are adorned with the images of Bodhisattvas, while the niches upon the windows are adorned with the images of taras with each hands holding flowers. The inner wall is adorned with the image of Hariti surrounded by children (some parts of this relief are missing) and Vaisravana. The inner wall also adorned with a bald male figure underneath an umbrella being upheld by servants, suggests that it may represent one of the temple's patrons. The collapsed ruins of Banyunibo were discovered in November 1940. Research continued to 1942 and succeeded to reconstruct the roof and the portal section of the temple. The reconstruction was halted due to World War II and Indonesian National Revolution. In 1962 the restoration of sub-basement, foot, and wall section of the temple, as well as the north wall, was finished. The reconstruction of Banyunibo temple was completed in 1978.

Geography Eddington was a village and is now a suburb in the south of Herne Bay, on what is now the Canterbury Road or A291. It is in Greenhill and Eddington ward, and forms part of Herne and Broomfield parish. =Geology and topography= Eddington is approximately 13 metres above sea level, lying above mainly London Clay with some head Brickearth next to Plenty Brook; however to the east this changes to Tertiary deposits of the Thanet, Oldhaven and Woolwich beds. Its northern boundary is the railway line, and its southern edge includes the Thanet Way and Herne Bay cemetery. At its western limit is Eddington Business Park and its eastern sector contains part of Eddington Conservation Area. This conservation area includes a small portion of the north-west of Herne and Broomfield parish, known locally as the Links. Herne Bay Golf Club is in the south of Eddington. Herne Bay Golf Club closed sometime during between 2011 and 2016 and has since been transformed into yet another housing estate. Eddington Business Park contains Herne Bay Delivery Office for the Royal Mail. Herne bay delivery and sorting office closed in 2016 and is now a children's soft play area. In the past, parts of Eddington have been susceptible to flooding from Plenty Brook and the Council has recommended the construction of upstream storage lagoons near Herne Bay Golf Course besides other measures. =Local government= As of January 2010 the local councillors for Greenhill and Eddington Ward were Roger Matthews and Margaret Flaherty, both representing the Liberal Democrats. Herne Bay councillor Roger Matthews was charged in March 2009 alongside Herne Bay Golf Club owner Julian in respect of corruption. Matthews represented Greenhill and Eddington ward on Canterbury City Council, and was suspended from the local Liberal Democrats group. The councillor denied the charge and was later cleared, but the businessman was convicted. Previously in 2008, Greenhill and Eddington ward representative Margaret Flaherty was taking on local council work herself, clearing shrubbery from road signs at Eddington. At times the council has chosen to remove travelling families from this area. Kent Enterprise House at Eddington hosts the annual parish meetings. History Much of the history of the layout and buildings of Eddington is described in the Eddington Conservation Appraisal of 2009. =Archaeology= Eddington Farm in 1932 Between August and September 1998, an archaeological dig by Houliston found evidence of early occupation in the vicinity of Eddington Farm, and a follow-up investigation by Crispin Jarman and Grant Shand found signs of occupation, farming and burial which had occurred from the later Neolithic period, around 3,500 BCE. The evidence for this was a polished stone axe found near the present Thanet Way. A late Bronze Age enclosure was found near a possibly earlier monument with a ring ditch. It is thought that late Bronze Age tree-clearance and consequent soil erosion may explain a subsequent period of abandonment of this farmland. The Romans and Romano-British then laid out a field system and made cremation burials. There is some evidence of local habitation occurring at the end of the Roman occupation. At the north of the Eddington Farm site in the early- or mid-Saxon period, a farmstead was built. In October 2003 Crispin Jarman investigated apparent concentrations of early to middle Iron Age activity and medieval activity on land adjacent to the old Thanet Way at Underdown Lane. It is thought that the 4‚Äì8 Iron Age roundhouses there are part of a larger settlement, along with a possible cremation burial. A possible northern edge of a medieval farmstead was discovered in the south- west corner of the site, along with pottery from the 13th and 14th centuries. In April 2007 there were archaeological investigations at Talmead House, Mill Lane, and on land to the west of Mill Lane, Eddington. Features including Roman cremation burials were found, including one adjacent to Talmead Pond. =Later history= Eddington, 1914, just north of Priory House on the east side of Canterbury Road: these buildings still exist 15th century to present: summary Eddington, of which ton means a small settlement or farmstead, is first mentioned in 1466 CE. Between the 16th and 19th centuries it was a hamlet set among fields, with farms, tracks and roads. By 1800 it had become a junction between roads to Sea Street (Upper Bay), Underdown, Greenhill, Blacksole, Beltinge Fostal and Herne Bay. There was an old track which turned sharply, linking Parsonage Farm and Badcock Farm, and this track was upgraded to a turnpike road joining Herne Bay and Canterbury in 1814. In 1860 the Faversham-Ramsgate railway (now Chatham Main Line) cut through the roads to Sea Street, Beltinge and Blacksole, but the Canterbury Road had its own bridge under the railway embankment, and at that time it was realigned to fit. Terraced housing was built on Canterbury Road in the 1890s, and Parsonage and Badcock farmsteads were demolished around 1900. Parsonage Road was developed by 1930, but there was no more development until the 1950s at Eddington Lane. Between the 1950s and the 21st century, most of the remaining open land was built up, except for The Links. For example, in the 1990s Nurserylands housing estate was built to the north of Eddington Lane and facing onto Plenty Brook; however Vincent Nurseries to the south of the development retains a rural aspect. One of the more recent developments in 2001 was St Augustine's Court housing estate on the junction of Canterbury Road and the Old Thanet Way (A2990). 19th century: spotlight In 1800 Edward Hasted described the parish, which included Herne, as follows: > A wild and dreary country; there is a great deal of poor land in it, covered > with broom, and several wastes or little commons, with cottages interspersed > among them. The soil of it is in general a stiff clay, and in some parts > mixed with gravel, the water throughout it is very brackish. The southern > part of it is mostly coppice woods, a considerable quantity of which belong > to the archbishop. and are in his own occupation. There are thirty-seven > teams kept in this parish. There are about seventeen acres of hops in it, > and not long ago double that number, and these are continually displanting. > It also produces much canary-seed, of which it has sometimes had one hundred > acres ... Northward from (Herne) is Underwood farm, and opposite to it the > parsonagehouse, formerly the residence of the Milles's. These are within the > hamlet of Eddinton, in which, further on upon the road, is a new-built > house, belonging to Mr. Edward Reynolds. Parsonage Road Hasted also mentions Underdowne Farm in Eddington, owned in 1800 by the Oxendon family who had rebuilt the farmhouse. Underdowne Farm was once part of the manor of Makinbrooke in the north-west part of the parish of Herne. This manor was originally owned by the See of Canterbury for the benefit of knights who served their country. After Edward III's reign the manor belonged to Adam le Eyre of London, then to Thomas Wolton of Eastbridge hospital in Canterbury. By 1528, Robert atte Sea of Herne was renting the land. It was subsequently inherited by the Crayford family, and then the aforementioned Oxendons. By 1858 Eddington and Underdown were separate districts of Herne parish. In Eddington, Edward Collard was a farmer, William Evans was the surgeon in Herne Street, Eddington, William Johncock was the blacksmith, and Thomas Taylor was running the Blacksmiths' Arms Inn. By 1891, Eddington was still a hamlet in the parish of Herne. It had a post office, a blacksmith, a builder and a maltster. Residences included Prospect House, The Priory and Eddington House. =Landmarks= Herne Bay Court Eddington College before 1914 Herne Bay Court Evangelical Centre, known locally as Herne Bay Court, was a Herne Bay local landmark from around 1900 to around 2008, situated near Talmead. Around 1900, James Thurman MA bought part of Parsonage Farm at Eddington from Joseph Gore who had leased 165 acres between Herne and the sea at the end of the 19th century. Gore kept the 15-acre field which still exists at the end of Parsonage Road, and kept a herd to supply The Creameries in Herne Bay, but sold up in 1914. Meanwhile, on the site of the old farmstead Thurman built New College, known locally as Eddington College, as a school in competition with Herne Bay College which at that time occupied numbers 6‚Äì8 St George's Terrace, Herne Bay and was run by Captain Eustace Turner. Both schools were evacuated in World War I and were requisitioned by the military. Thurman retired and after the war Eddington College was taken over by Captain Turner who ran it as Herne Bay College until 1939. The college specialised in engineering, and in the 1930s \\"the College possessed one of the largest and best-equipped school engineering workshops in England, and was remarkable for its many engineering examination successes.\\" However the building and its engineering equipment were requisitioned for the World War II war effort. After the loss of the engineering equipment, the school could not reopen after the war and the building was sold. It reopened in 1949 as Herne Bay Court: a Christian conference centre. By 2006 it had closed and was standing empty for several years, with the council discussing development plans. Between 2007 and 2010 there was a local movement to save or reopen Herne Bay Court. This building is locally listed in respect of its use as army headquarters in World War II. The trees at Herne Bay court are subject to a tree preservation order. Eddington Farm, now demolished Eddington Farm (demolished) Eddington Farm was on Eddington Lane and next to Plenty Brook. It originally occupied the site of the present Herne Bay sorting office and business park. It was recorded as a 40‚àíacre farm in 1661, stretching as far as Parsonage Farm, along what is now Canterbury Road and Mill Lane. Past owners and tenants included Richard Constant, Jarvis Dadd, John and Mary Sole and Richard Reynolds. By 1841 it was an arable and pasture farm owned by Edward Collard. Pear Tree House (now The Priory) Location of The Priory and Eddington House, 1908 This was at Pigeon Lane, later named Priory Lane. This road joined with Canterbury Road and Underdown Lane, and at the junction there was a hamlet including a smithy, letterbox and guidepost. A ladies' seminary occupied Pear Tree House from the 1830s to 1880s, run by Mrs Sladden and then by sisters Jane and Mary Baskerville. During this period the building was called Pear Tree House until around 1887 when the school closed and it was occupied by Charles Lethbridge and was renamed The Priory. It was a care home for some years, then became a residence. As of 2011 it is a bed and breakfast establishment. Eddington House (demolished) This Georgian house of around 1790 was built as a country residence in spacious grounds on the site now occupied by the Beaumanor housing estate, on the corner between Canterbury Road and Eddington Lane. In the early 20th century it became the preparatory school for Herne Bay College,See :File:Eddington House Eddington Kent.jpg being renamed Eddington College. It continued as a prep school, changing its name to Bramdean in 1957 and then Beaumanor in the 1960s. It was demolished in 1968 by developers, and the subsequent housing estate was given the name of Beaumanor. Listed buildings All the nationally listed buildings in this area are Grade II or II*. Some of these are listed as groups: Underdown House ;Underdown House group: Underdown House is in Underdown Lane and the associated group includes The Cottage, the Tithe Barn to the south-west and the Old Coach House. The L-shaped Underdown House has a 17th-century west wing and an 18th-century frontage; it has original casement windows with small leaded panes at the back on the west side and at the west end of the southern frontage. Unfortunately the originally rural setting of the house has been compromised by recent contiguous housing estates, St Augustine's Court and Wye Green. The Cottage is mid-19th-century with a hipped slate roof and original cambered sash windows. The Old Coach House is late-17th- to early-18th-century, and is weatherboarded with a tie-beam roof. The Tithe Barn dates from around 1500, and is weatherboarded over a red brick base, with a thatched roof which was once tiled. On the east side the roof has a projecting thatched hip which contains a few original tiles. The Priory ;Priory (The) group: The Priory is at 203 Canterbury Road. The group includes numbers 1 and 2 Laurel Cottages (numbers 195 and 197 Canterbury Road), and Little Cottage. The Priory is an early-19th-century brown-brick house in Gothic Revival style, including a pointed doorway with moulded architrave. Laurel Cottages date from the 18th century and they have since been pebbledashed, but contain original sash windows. Little Cottage is timber- framed and was re-faced with stucco in the 18th century; it has a tiled roof and original sash windows. Forge Cottage, 2011 ;Forge Cottage (The) and sewer vent column: The Forge Cottage is at 250 Canterbury Road. It is an 18th- century, weatherboarded and timber-framed building with a half-hipped, tiled roof. The doorcase is 18th-century, but the 6-panelled door has been moved to another location on the building. Also on Canterbury Road but not grouped with The Forge Cottage is a listed, cast iron sewer vent column with Corinthian capital, dated 1870 and made by W. Macfarlane and Co. in Glasgow. Among locally listed World War II monuments are the Warden's Post at Eddington House Junior School, Canterbury Road, and the Army occupation of Avonleigh, Parsonage Road. Also relating to World War II is the pillbox near the former crossroads of the Thanet Way and Canterbury Road. Dating from the 19th century or earlier is the Maltings at Eddington Farm. Cemetery Section J of Herne Bay Cemetery where Edmund Reid lies Herne Bay cemetery lies at the southern end of Eddington and is controlled by Canterbury City Council. The earliest burials date from 1871. In 1880 interments were officially ended at Herne church and other local graveyards. Edmund Reid, the head of CID who investigated the Whitechapel murders in 1888, is buried in plot J62. Scattered among the plots there are war graves from World Wars I and II. The cemetery contains an elaborate monument to Lydia Cecilia Hill, known as Cissie Hill, a cabaret dancer and close friend of Ibrahim, Sultan of Johor who funded the building of Mayfair Court and the associated servants' quarters in Grand Drive, Herne Bay for her.Information from Herne Bay Historical Records Society In 1938 there were rumours of an engagement between the \\"glamour girl\\" Sissy and the 64-year-old divorcee sultan, whom she had met in Ceylon in 1934, but the sultan promptly denied this. Sissy was killed in a daylight bombing raid at the age of 27 years while shopping in Canterbury on 11 October 1940, and was identified by her jewellery, said to be a gift from the sultan. Looking north from the Canterbury Road and Underdown Lane junction, 1908. The weatherboarded building in the foreground is the 18th-century Forge Cottage, and the brick building with large door and chimney may have been the forge. The tall building in the centre is Eddington Villas, built 1896. Beyond the curve of the road ahead on the left would have been the spacious grounds of Eddington House, now the Beaumanor housing estate. Opposite Eddington house, on the right of the road in the distance would have been the grounds of New College (now Herne Bay Court) which was built on the Parsonage farmstead site around 1900. The same scene, photographed in 2011, can be seen in the image above right.

Along with his affiliation with the University of Western Ontario (where he teaches Clinical Neurological Science) he is affiliated with the London Health Sciences Centre's University Hospital (where he has set up and runs stroke prevention clinics) and the Robarts Research Institute, one of Canada's leading medical research organizations. He is a recognized expert in stroke prevention and stroke prevention research and has over 500 peer-reviewed publications since 1970. He has delivered more than 600 lectures in 38 countries to physicians around the world. In 2015, he received the Research Excellence Award from the Canadian Society for Atherosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology. In 2019, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada. Dr. Spence is the director of the Stroke Prevention & Atherosclerosis Research Centre (SPARC), a unit of the Robarts Research Institute. With Maria Dicicco, RVT, he pioneered the measurement of total plaque area (TPA) in a patient's carotid artery using ultrasound technology. The ability to measure TPA gives doctors the ability to treat, and measure the change in, the amount of plaque in a patient's arteries and has given researchers the ability to measure the effectiveness of new drug treatment therapies for stroke prevention.Spence JD, et al. Carotid Plaque Area: A Tool for Targeting and Evaluating Vascular Preventive Therapy Stroke. 2002;33:2916-2922 in high-risk patients with narrowing of the carotid arteries, the process of \\"Treating Arteries\\" was associated with a >80% reduction in the 2-year risk of strokes and heart attacks. doi: 10.1001/archneurol.2009.289. PubMed PMID: 20008646 Dr. Spence is recognized as \\"The Father of Total Plaque Area Measurement\\" and the importance of TPA measurement is that, in Dr Spence's words, \\"We can now treat arteries instead of just treating risk factors\\".  Spence - Key Research Discoveries  Cerebral consequences of hypertension: treating high blood pressure prevents only arteriolar strokes. (.Stroke 1986; 17(5):808-10) This research led to the understanding that the effects of therapies, designed to reduce hypertension, on blood pressure need to be distinguished from other effects on atherosclerosis. Effects of antihypertensive drugs on blood velocity and arterial flow disturbances 1976, 1980, 1995: these studies showed that antihypertensive drugs have different effects on blood velocity and arterial flow disturbances, which have implications for how effective they are at fighting the buildup of arterial plaque. (.Magn Reson Med Jan 2002;47:149-159) Effects of grapefruit juice on drug metabolism: The discovery with Drs. David Bailey and Malcolm Arnold, that grapefruit juice markedly increases blood levels of a number of drugs that have low bioavailability because of gut wall first-pass metabolism by CYP3A4 made a major contribution to the understanding of pharmacokinetics, and has opened up a new field of pharmacology. (Lancet 1991; 337(8736):268-9). Ultrasound measurement of plaque: Beginning in 1990, Dr. Spence pioneered the use of carotid plaque measurement (as opposed to intima-media thickness) for research and for management of patients with carotid artery disease. (.Spence JD, et al. Carotid Plaque Area: A Tool for Targeting and Evaluating Vascular Preventive Therapy Stroke. 2002;33:2916-2922). This has evolved to the use of 3-D plaque volume measurements for evaluation of new therapies. The effect of drug therapies on carotid plaque volume can now be evaluated in a very cost-effective way. Development of quantitative traits for human atherosclerosis: Spence developed a number of quantitative traits that will advance the search for new genetic causes of atherosclerosis, and thus new therapeutic targets and new therapies for atherosclerosis. These are unexplained atherosclerosis and its progression, unexplained protection from atherosclerosis and unexplained regression of atherosclerosis. (;.Stroke 1999;30:969-73; Atherosclerosis 1999;144:429-340Stroke 2003;34:1178-1182, Nature Clinical Practice Neurology 2006;2: 611-619Lanktree MB, Hegele RA, Schork NJ, Spence JD. Extremes of unexplained variation as a phenotype: an efficient approach for genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular disease. Circ Cardiovasc Genet Apr 2010; 3: 215 ‚Äì 221) Appropriate carotid endarterectomy: Showed in 2005 (Stroke 2005;36:2373-2378) that with intensive medical therapy most patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis cannot benefit from endarterectomy or stenting, and that the very small proportion (10%) who may benefit can be identified by microembolus detection on transcranial Doppler. Showed in 2010 (Arch Neurol. 2010 Feb; 67(2):180-6) that the proportion who could benefit had declined with more intensive therapy to less than 5%. SPARC's work was confirmed in 2010 by an international multicenter study, the ACES study. Dr. Spence led a study in the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network, on histological validation of imaging features of vulnerable plaque that will also serve to identify high- risk carotid plaques. Physiologically individualized therapy for resistant hypertension. Reported in 2017 that in patients in three hypertension clinics in Africa, measuring plasma renin activity and aldosterone markedly improved blood pressure control, but permitting selection of the treatment that is appropriate to that patient, by identifying the physiological cause of the hypertension. doi: 10.1093/ajh/hpx066. PubMed PMID: 28472315. Effects of the intestinal microbiome on atherosclerosis He reported with colleagues in 2018 that patients with carotid atherosclerosis not explained by traditional risk factors had higher blood levels of toxic metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria from foods such as red meat and egg yolk. doi:10.3390/nu10060779. PubMed PMID: 29914158, His group also found that blood levels of those toxic products are elevated with even moderate impairment of kidney function, such as seen in elderly patients. doi: 10.1053/j.jrn.2018.05.007. Epub 2018 Aug 9. PubMed PMID: 30100156. This has important implications for diet, and offers the possibility of an entirely new way of treating atherosclerosis: repopulation of the intestinal microbiome.

After World War II there were 17 steamboats altogether but as time went by they decayed and most of them were set aside. Only two of them are still in use ‚Äì Vltava and Vy≈°ehrad. Vltava belongs to a group of rather small steamboats. It had to be shorter and narrower in order to be able to sail easily and safely through the very busy locks on the route from Prague to ≈†tƒõchovice for which it had originally been built. Because there were very low bridges on the river it did not even have a sightseeing deck. It was made in the PRAGA shipyard in Prague under the supervision of the chief constructor Mr Benbenek. After some delay it was finally floated out on 27 August 1940. It was worth 2.7 million Czech crowns. During World War II it had to be renamed along with many other boats. Its name was Moldau I (Moldau is a German word for the Vltava). The steamboat kept running on its route to ≈†tƒõchovice until 1990 when it was put aside after an accident. In 1991 it was partially repaired and started operating as a restaurant boat. The last reconstruction was carried out in 2007 when the steamboat was completely reconstructed to resemble the one from 1940 as closely as possible.  Technical details  The steamboat's length is 53 meters and it is 5.1 metres wide. It has a 112,5 kW (150 k) steam engine. The Vltava can hold 250 passengers, 100 of them can be seated. It reaches the speed of 16.5 km/h. It has its own restaurant, bar and a partially covered deck.  Modern usage  Originally Vltava was used for connecting Prague and ≈†tƒõchovice, later its route was extended to Slapy. In 1991 it became a restaurant boat and began use as a sightseeing boat for Prague river cruises as well as cruises to Mƒõln√≠k or Slapy. Now it mainly serves as a sightseeing steamboat in Prague.

In addition, the track was recently featured on The Crown Jewels Part 2 CD by Aroe and the Soundmakers, in its 1990 demo format. Before the release of the Trials Of Life EP by the Gutter Snypes on the imprint, Johnny F spent much of his time running Liberty Grooves - The Hip Hop Shop in Tooting. At the same time, Whirlwind was living on the South Coast. Despite this, the duo wrote another track, \\"Battle Tipped Rhyme\\",Heroes Of UK Hip Hop website which although never ready for release, was performed on a number of occasions. This track was rebuilt by The Assembly Worker and Whirlwind D, and finally released in 2010 to mark 20 years of the Liberty Grooves record label.

The character is portrayed by actress Ashley Fink, and has appeared in Glee since the season one episode \\"Wheels\\", first broadcast on November 11, 2009. Lauren was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. She is a member of New Directions, the glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. Her storylines have seen her interact with other members of the glee club and form a relationship with Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling). Lauren is also the president of the AV club, and a member of the school's wrestling team. She joins the glee club in the show's second season, putting her in close contact with some of the shows main characters. Following the character's significantly expanded role in the second season, Fink's portrayal has received predominantly positive reviews. Rosie O'Donnell criticized the character, saying that Fink was unattractive and therefore a bad representation of fat people, but later apologized for these remarks. Lauren made her solo musical debut in the second season, performing The Waitresses' \\"I Know What Boys Like\\" in the episode \\"Comeback\\". The song was well received by critics, and was released as a single, available for download; it was subsequently included on the EP released in September 2011 through the Target chain, Glee: The Music, Dance Party. Although Lauren also appears in ensemble musical performances, Fink is not credited as a vocalist on the series' soundtrack albums. Lauren's role was reduced in the beginning of the third season, and she made a final, non-speaking appearance in the third episode, \\"Asian F\\". After this, it was confirmed she would appear once again in Glee and doing so in the fourth season's episode \\"Sadie Hawkins\\", which premiered on 24 January 2013. After this, she made numerous appearances in flashbacks before appearing one final time in the series finale, \\"Dreams Come True\\", during the performance of OneRepublic's \\"I Lived\\" by the glee club's alumni. Storylines Throughout the first season of Glee, Lauren makes numerous guest appearances. She is a member of the McKinley High wrestling team, as well as president of the AV club. She first appears in the episode \\"Wheels\\", where she unsuccessfully tries out for a spot on the cheerleading team. She reappears in \\"Hell-O\\", when cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester assembles a group of unpopular, lonely students, whom she dubs the \\"Old Maid's Club\\". Lauren later helps glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) to rig hidden microphones in the choir room to prove that the rest of the glee club are not pulling their weight in rehearsals. She is later seen as the leader of a group of goths who idolize Twilight character Edward Cullen. Lauren's role becomes more prominent in the second season. Glee club member Puck (Mark Salling) asks her to join New Directions so they will have enough members to qualify for a show choir competition. Lauren accepts, on the condition that she gets seven minutes in heaven with him, though it is later revealed that she became bored with Puck's kissing style after three minutes. In the Valentine's Day-themed episode \\"Silly Love Song\\", Puck reveals that he has fallen in love with Lauren, and serenades her with Queen's \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\". She finds his song choice insulting and stands him up on a pre-Valentine's date, but eventually agrees to spend Valentine's Day with him as friends. Lauren makes her solo debut in the following episode, where she performs a rendition of \\"I Know What Boys Like.\\" Puck helps her, by advising her to picture the other members in their underwear, which she does in her timid-turned-confident performance. In the episode, \\"Sexy\\", Lauren enlists Puck to make a sex tape with her, as she believes the publicity will make her a star, but they give up the idea when they learn it would constitute child pornography, as both are underage. In \\"Born This Way\\", Lauren reveals to Puck that she'd been a child beauty queen, \\"Miss Tiara Toddler\\", before she gained weight and became ineligible; Puck tells her he will run a campaign for her to become prom queen, and be her king. When Quinn, who is prom queen frontrunner, sees Lauren putting up posters for her own candidacy, she confronts Lauren, and the ensuing encounter is heated. Lauren decides to dig up dirt on Quinn as a campaign tactic, and aided by Puck, discovers that Quinn used to be overweight and unpopular before slimming down and transferring to McKinley; Lauren then plasters the school with pictures of the old Quinn, humiliating her. But the tactic backfires, making Quinn more popular, and hurting Lauren's candidacy. Lauren apologizes to Quinn, Quinn says she respects Lauren, and the two reach an understanding. Neither Lauren nor Puck win the race for prom queen and king, but they remain a couple; they fly with the rest of New Directions to the nationals competition in New York City, where the glee club comes in twelfth out of fifty teams. This defeat leads Lauren to quit the glee club at the beginning of the third season and break up with Puck. Development =Casting and creation= Ashley Fink was cast as Lauren Zizes Lauren is portrayed by actress Ashley Fink. She made routine guest appearances throughout the first season, and became a member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode \\"Special Education\\". Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club, Fink initially reacted with disbelief. She commented, \\"I didn't quite believe it at first, I thought I was getting Punk'd.\\" She said that being cast in Glee makes her feel like \\"the luckiest girl in the world\\". Fink's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine. She said, \\"In life, there's so much diversity, and it's not necessarily represented on television. I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and it‚Äôs just so inspirational.\\" When asked about her casting process, Fink said: Fink does not know how long her character will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: \\"I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her.\\" Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: \\"Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss‚Äîwho's exploded with popularity‚Äîand Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold.\\" =Characterization= In her first episode, it is revealed that Lauren is a member of William McKinley High's wrestling team. TV Squad has said that \\"Lauren can deliver a zinger with the bite of Sue Sylvester and the humor of our beloved Brittany Pierce.\\" Seth Abramovitch of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude: \\"Zizes isn't just a heavy, supremely confident girl. She's also extremely violent. She‚Äôs on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was a lot more than just bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There‚Äôs a word for people who do things like that in the real world: It's 'asshole'.\\" He went on to add: \\"Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine‚Äîan obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's \\"Fat-Bottomed Girls,\\" she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'.\\" Journalist James Poniewozik of Time magazine commented of the episode \\"Silly Love Songs\\": \\"It was the kind of twist Glee can sell, partly because of the way the characters are established (in retrospect, you can see how a really strong woman who rejects him is a turn-on for Puck) and because of how well its cast (Ashley Fink has been killing it as Lauren, and sells her confidence and abrasiveness in a way that makes her a person, not an engineered positive-body-image model). And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on-the-nose song choices, \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" was just a perfect choice and performance‚Äînot just on topic but actually in Puck's musical wheelhouse.\\" =Relationships= Over the course of Glee second season, Lauren forms a relationship with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled \\"Special Education\\". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: \\"I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know what you mean, but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, it comes down to whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about the two of them together that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility.\\" Television critics have responded positively to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN said of the episode \\"Silly Love Songs\\": \\"The absolute best part of \\"Silly Love Songs\\" was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, it was nice to even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's \\"Fat Bottomed Girls,\\" induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: \\"For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self- professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that ‚Äúbad‚Äù at all. But it‚Äôs always fun to watch Salling sing, and it‚Äôs always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings.\\" In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck \\"a lot less assured\\" than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes \\"as endearing as they are unrealistic\\", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that \\"the ice around [her] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo.\\" Reception Puck (Mark Salling, pictured) plays a large role in Lauren's storylines. Lauren has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Canning praised Fink's performance in the episode \\"Silly Love Songs\\", as well as Lauren's dialog. Lisa Respers France of CNN commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren, noting: \\"for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is able to take the concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and shove it back in our faces with a side order of fabulousness.\\" Reiter felt that in \\"Comeback\\", new characters Lauren and Sam \\"managed to shine\\". Rosie O'Donnell reacted negatively to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In an interview with Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of \\"I Know What Boys Like\\" underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren \\"so unlikable,\\" and questioned why the producers had not cast a \\"pretty heavy girl\\". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, \\"Oh, Ashley ‚Äì I love your swagger ‚Äì your acting ‚Äì your face ‚Äì your heart ‚Äì as a famous fat person ‚Äì I am often asked about the issue‚Ä¶ I love the story line ‚Äì I love the show ‚Äì and if in any way something I said hurt you ‚Äì I apologize MORE. You are so talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt it‚Ä¶as I know you can‚Äîthe often misquoted Rosie.\\" Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: \\"I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just become a source of great comedy ‚Äì is that because she's full-figured? No. Is it because her character is well-written? Yes. It‚Äôs kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do.\\" Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called Lauren's performance of \\"I Know What Boys Like\\" the highlight of \\"Comeback\\". Gonzalez was less than enthused. She graded it \\"C‚àí\\", after \\"deductions\\", and said the only reason it started with a \\"C\\" was due to it being interspersed with shots of the cast in their underwear. Patrick Burns of The Atlantic was also unimpressed, and questioned Lauren's spot in the glee club, commenting \\"her brazen character never ceases to please, but it's just not believable that she would join the glee club if she cannot sing.\\" References External links Category:Glee (TV series) characters Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Fictional singers Category:Fictional wrestlers Category:American female characters in television Category:Teenage characters in television ","title":"Lauren Zizes"},{"id":"30627260","text":"Katherine Larson is an American poet, molecular biologist and field ecologist.\\"On the NewsHour: Poet Katherine Larson\\", PBS NewsHour, 14 March 2012.

Initially the Coast Guard established a base on the Hawaiian Archipelago in 1945, with a pair of PBY-5 Catalinas and one Grumman G-21 Goose. The air unit maintained supervision for the windward side of Oahu. In 1949 the Command moved to Naval Air Station Barbers Point, and in 1965 the unit received its current designation of Coast Guard Air Station Barbers point. For 24 years the Sikorsky HH-52 Seaguard was the primary SAR helicopter, unit 1987 when it was retired and replaced with the A√©rospatiale HH-65 Dolphin. The fixed wing component has consisted of various models of the C-130 Hercules which have been assigned to the unit since 1959. Currently, AIRSTA Barbers Point has the HC-130H model in use, configured primarily as a search and rescue aircraft. It has the ability to airdrop rescue equipment to survivors at sea or on land. It can take operate from short, unprepared airfields. Today 200 officers and enlisted personnel maintain a continuous service for the Fourteenth Coast Guard District. Duties include aviation mission support for Search and Rescue, Marine Environmental Protection, Maritime Law Enforcement and Aids to Navigation. Since 1979, the unit has been awarded two Coast Guard Unit Commendations and four Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendations for exemplary service.

The event was the 15th event produced under the Rey de Reyes name and also the 15th time that the Rey de Reyes tournament was held. Production =Background= Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \\"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2011 show was the 15th Rey de Reyes show in the series. =Storylines= The Rey de Reyes show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The fortifications were built as part of France's Maginot Line defensive strategy, but the sector lacks the large interconnected fortifications found along France's land border with Germany. The sector's principal defense was the Rhine itself, which could be crossed only by boat or by seizing a bridge crossing. The sector's fortifications chiefly took the form of casemates and blockhouses. The SF Colmar was flanked to the north by the Fortified Sector of the Lower Rhine to the north and the Fortified Sector of Mulhouse to the south. The Colmar sector was directly attacked by German forces on 15 June 1940, capturing or destroying most of the fortifications in the sector in three days.  Concept and organization  The Maginot Rhine defenses employed three lines of defense, with blockhouses or casemates close to the Rhine (the first line), backed by infantry shelters (the second line). The third line was a strong series of casemates, built on the model of interval casemates in the northeastern sections of the Line, but without lower levels. All of the Colmar fortifications were built in the mid-1930s by the Commission d'Organisation des R√©gions Fortifi√©es (CORF). CORF was responsible for the major fortifications of the Maginot Line, but in this area no major positions or ouvrages were built.Mary, Tome 3, pp. 146-148Romanych, Rupp, p. 85 The riverbank fortifications were of a basic nature, with protection only up to 155mm caliber, machine gun armament and no electrical system. The second and third lines were more robust in construction and equipment, with electric generators and anti-tank weapons.Kauffmann, p. 76 The heaviest concentration of fortifications were in the area of Neuf-Brisach, itself a preserved fortress from the Vauban era. Neuf-Brisach guarded a strategic bridge across the Rhine. Insignia of the 28th RIF. Insignia of the 42nd RIF.  Command  The Colmar sector was under the overall command of the French 8th Army, which was in turn part of Army Group 3 under General Besson. The SF Colmar was commanded by General Coradin, then General Poisot and finally General Cousse from 1 January 1940. The command post was at Colmar. The interval troops, the army formations that were to provide the mobile defense for the sector, to support and be supported by the fixed defenses, were under the command of the 13th Corps (13e Corps d'Armee), General Misserey, commander. The primary interval formation was the 54th Infantry Division. Artillery support for the sector was provided by the first battalion of the 170th Position Artillery Regiment (R√©giment d'Artillerie de Position (RAP)), which controlled both fixed and mobile artillery, commanded by Chef d'Escadron Maigret. The 54th ID was a Class B reserve formation, not suitable for sustained or heavy combat. From 16 March 1940 the SF Colmar was designated the 104th Fortress Infantry Division, or \\"Colmar Division,\\" incorporating the 9th and 10th battalions of the Chasseurs Pyr√©n√©ens. At the midpoint of the Battle of France on 1 June 1940, the fortress troops of the 104th DIF amounted to two fortress infantry regiments in four battalions and one regular infantry regiment in three battalions, comprising 300 officers and 10,300 men.Mary, Tome 3, p. 189  Description  The sector includes, in order from west to east, the following major fortified positions, together with the most significant casemates and infantry shelters (abris) in each sub-sector. = Sub-sector of Elsenheim = 42nd Fortress Infantry Regiment (42e R√©giment d'Infanterie de Forteresse (RIF)), Lt.

By this time the main French army was in full retreat. The casemate lines along the Rhine were not supported by significant mobile forces or field artillery, which had been diverted to more urgent tasks. The casemates were designed to be mutually supporting, with fields of fire along the Rhine rather than across it. The first line was exposed to enemy fire from across the Rhine, a distance of a few hundred meters. German forces, under General Dollmann, amounted to seven divisions of the Seventh Army, supported by about three hundred artillery pieces.Mary, pp. 196-200 The codename Kleiner B√§r (\\"Little Bear\\" or \\"Lesser Bear\\") was given to the planned German cross- Rhine operation. The initial attack started at 0900 (some sources say 1000) on 15 June with artillery bombardments. 8.8 cm guns concentrated on the French positions just across the river, destroying many in a few minutes.Mary, Tome 3, p. 197Romanych, p.88 At 0920 the first assault crossed the river, composed of the German 218th Infantry Division at Schoenau, the 221st Infantry Division at Limbourg and the 239th Infantry Division at Sponeck. Supporting operations were carried out by the 554th ID at Neuf-Brisach and the 557th ID at Rhinau in the Lower Rhine sector. In most locations the French were unable to mount a serious defense, lacking artillery support and mobile forces. Riverbank positions were cleared quickly or destroyed by the Germans. The strongest resistance was posed by Casemate Schoenau Sud, which caused the 218th ID to suspend a portion of its crossing operations. Stronger resistance came from the third defensive line, supported by interval troops. Heavy fighting took place around Neuf-Brisach, where the German 554th ID's 623rd Infantry Regiment encountered Casemate Fort-Mortier and its supporting troops from the 28th RIF. The 623rd was pinned to the riverbank. The 557th ID's attack at Rhinau was intended to be a diversionary attack, but it produced significant success. The artillery bombardment and infantry attack destroyed most French positions, with only Casemate Rhinau Sud holding out through the day. Several positions in the third line were taken by the Germans on the 15th at Rhinau. In all, at the end of 15 June, German forces held a shallow bridgehead wide, extending to the third line, about back from the riverbank. The Germans used the night to land reinforcements.Romanych, p.89 16 June opened with another artillery bombardment, followed up by attacks on the third line of casemates, supported by unopposed Stuka attacks. By evening third-line casemates in the central portion of the front were being captured or were surrendering. The most significant resistance was mounted by Casemates Marckolsheim Sud and Nord, but Sud was captured by evening and Nord the next morning. Apart from some casemate crews left to cover their retreat, the survivors of the 104th and 105th DIF abandoned the remaining fortifications overnight, retreating to new positions in the Vosges mountains. Colmar was occupied on the 17th, but some casemates held out until the 18th. The French Army Group 2, of which the 104th and 105th were a part, was encircled in the Vosges, remaining there until they surrendered at last on 25 June.Romanych, p.90 Units The 28th Fortress Infantry Regiment was positioned in the Dessenheim sub-sector. German fire on the 15 June forced many riverside casemate garrisons out of their positions, followed up by aerial bombardment the next day One the 18th the regiment retreated, the first battalion to Hohneck and the second to the Markstein and the Petit-Ballon in the Vosges. By the 21st the first battalion was pushed back to the Reinkopf, the La Bresse, finally surrendering at Wildensein. The second battalion was surrounded at Markstein, where most of the unit was captured.Mary, Tome 1, p. 92 The 42nd Fortress Infantry Regiment held the Elsenheim sub-sector. On 17 June the regiment retreated to Kaysersberg in the Vosges, fighting an action against the Germans at the Col du Surceneux. The regiment was captured on 22 June.Mary, Tome 1, p. 96 = 1944 = As Allied forces approached the Rhine in November 1944, the Germans destroyed many of the bankside fortifications that had escaped damage in 1940.Mary, Tome 5, p. 142  Present situation  Interior of Saasenheim casemate in 2011 Most of the Rhine defenses were simply abandoned after World War II. Most of the first line of blockhouses on the banks of the river were destroyed when the river was widened as part of navigational improvements in the 1970s.Romanych, p. 93 Many village line positions remain, but have been stripped by salvagers.Mary, Tome 5, p. 155 Marckolsheim Sud (35/3) casemate was preserved in 1972Kaufmann 2011, p.181 and is operated as the Memorial Museum of the Maginot Line of the Rhine (Mus√©e M√©morial de la Ligne Maginot du Rhin).

He is Professor of Media Studies at The New School in New York City. His writing is often associated with the philosophy of nihilism and pessimism. Thacker's most recent books are the Horror of Philosophy series (including the book In the Dust of This Planet) and Infinite Resignation. He received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, and a PhD in Comparative Literature from Rutgers University. Works Thacker's most widely read book is In the Dust of This Planet, part of his Horror of Philosophy trilogy.In The Dust Of This Planet has been translated into several languages, including Spanish (Materia Oscura, 2015), Italian (Nero Editions 2018), Russian (Hyle Press, 2017), and German (Mathes & Seitz 2019). In it, Thacker explores the idea of the \\"unthinkable world\\" as represented in the horror fiction genre, in philosophies of pessimism and nihilism, and in the apophatic (\\"darkness\\") mysticism traditions. In the first volume, In the Dust of This Planet, Thacker calls the horror of philosophy \\"the isolation of those moments in which philosophy reveals its own limitations and constraints, moments in which thinking enigmatically confronts the horizon of its own possibility.\\"Thacker, In The Dust Of This Planet - Horror of Philosophy vol. 1, p. 2. Thacker distinguishes the \\"world-for-us\\" (the human-centric view of the world), and the \\"world-in- itself\\" (the world as it exists in essence), from what he calls the \\"world- without-us\\": \\"the world-without-us lies somewhere in between, in a nebulous zone that is at once impersonal and horrific.\\"Thacker, In The Dust Of This Planet - Horror of Philosophy vol. 1, p. 6. Thacker's major philosophical work is After Life. In it, Thacker argues that the ontology of life operates by way of a split between \\"Life\\" and \\"the living,\\" making possible a \\"metaphysical displacement\\" in which life is thought via another metaphysical term, such as time, form, or spirit: \\"Every ontology of life thinks of life in terms of something-other-than-life...that something-other-than-life is most often a metaphysical concept, such as time and temporality, form and causality, or spirit and immanence\\"Thacker, After Life, p. x. See After Life , talk and interview, Ctheory/PAC-TAC lecture series, November 2008. Thacker traces this theme from Aristotle, to Scholasticism and mysticism/negative theology, to Spinoza and Kant, showing how this three-fold displacement is also alive in philosophy today (life as time in process philosophy and Deleuzianism, life as form in biopolitical thought, life as spirit in post-secular philosophies of religion). Ultimately Thacker argues for a skepticism regarding \\"life\\": \\"Life is not only a problem of philosophy, but a problem for philosophy.Thacker, After Life, p. x. Thacker's work has often been associated with contemporary philosophies of nihilism and pessimism, as well as to speculative realism. His text \\"Cosmic Pessimism\\" defines pessimism as \\"the philosophical form of disenchantment.\\"Thacker, \\"Cosmic Pessimism\\", continent 2.2 (2012). The text begins with the following line: \\"Pessimism is the night-side of thought, a melodrama of the futility of the brain, a poetry written in the graveyard of philosophy.\\" In 2013 Thacker, along with Alexander Galloway and McKenzie Wark, published the book Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation. There Thacker writes about dark media or technologies that mediate between the natural and supernatural. In the opening of the book the authors ask \\"Does everything that exists, exist to me presented and represented, to be mediated and remediated, to be communicated and translated? There are mediative situations in which heresy, exile, or banishment carry the day, not repetition, communion, or integration. There are certain kinds of messages that state 'there will be no more messages'. Hence for every communication there is a correlative excommunication.\\"Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and Mediation, Alexander R. Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark (University of Chicago Press, 2013), p. 10. This approach has been referred to as the \\"New York School of Media Theory.\\"Geert Lovnik, \\"Hermes on the Hudson: Notes on Media Theory after Snowden\\", e-flux #54 (2014). Thacker's poetry and fiction has appeared in anthologies such as Degenerative Prose (published by Black Ice/FC2), Diagram: Selections from the Magazine (edited by Ander Monson), Debug: Primary Techno Noir (edited by Kenji Siratori), Alt-X, and Black Ice Magazine.See http://altx.com Thacker has produced book arts projects, and an anti-novel titled An Ideal for Living, of which American poet and conceptual writer Kenneth Goldsmith has said: \\"this an important book...these pages take cues from Burroughs and Gibson, while at the same time presciently pointing to the web-based path writing would take over the next decade.\\"From the back cover blurb, published by Schism Press. With Ronald Sukenick and Mark Amerika, Thacker helped establish Alt-X Press, for which he edited the anthology Hard_Code.An ebook version is at Alt-X Press. Thacker has also collaborated with art, media, and music collectives.These include Fakeshop, which has presented work at Ars Electronica and the 2000 Whitney Biennial, Biotech Hobbyist, and Merzbow. Thacker produced a CD of noise music released by Extreme Records (Sketches for Biotech Research, XCD-046), as well as a collaborative CD with Merzbow, part of the Merzbow Box Set released in 2000. The Box Set also includes a book titled Merzbook that includes Thacker's essay \\"Bataille/Body/Noise.\\" Thacker's earlier works adopt approaches from the philosophy of science & technology. Examples are his book BiomediaSee What Is Biomedia?, Configurations 11.1/Project Muse (2003), and the entry \\"Biomedia\\" in Critical Terms for Media Studies, University of Chicago Press, 2010. and writings on bioinformatics, nanotechnology, biocomputing, complexity, CAS (complex adaptive systems), swarms and networks.Networks, Swarms, Multitudes, part 1, part 2, Ctheory (2004), Biophilosophy for the 21st Century, Ctheory (6 September 2005). This work is also interested in the boundary between science and science fiction.See Biomedia. Also \\"The Science Fiction of Technoscience\\" in Leonardo 34.2 (2001); \\"SF, Technoscience, Net Art\\" in Art Journal 59 (2000). An example is Thacker's concept of \\"biomedia\\" which he defines as following: \\"Biomedia entail the informatic recontextualization of biological components and processes, for ends that may be medical or nonmedical...and with effects that are as much cultural, social, and political as they are scientific.\\" He goes on to clarify, saying: \\"biomedia continuously make the dual demand that information materialize itself as gene or protein compounds. This point cannot be overstated: biomedia depend upon an understanding of biological as informational but not immaterial.\\"Thacker, \\"Biomedia\\", in WJT Mitchell & Mark BN Hansen (editors), Critical Terms for Media Studies, University of Chicago Press 2010, p. 123. Thacker distinguishes biomedia from traditional concepts of biotechnology, as seen in science fiction via cyborgs. With biomedia, he writes, \\"the emphasis is less on 'technology' as a tool, and more on the technical reconditioning of the 'biological.' It is this assumption that characterizes the concept of 'biomedia.'\\"Thacker, \\"What Is Biomedia?\\", p. 52 Thacker explicitly distinguishes this from mechanical prosthetics and sci-fi tropes of downloading human consciousness into virtual reality. He writes, \\"By contrast, what we find with biomedia is a constant, consistent, and methodical inquiry into the technical-philosophical question of 'what a body can do.'\\"Thacker, \\"What Is Biomedia?\\", \\"Configurations,\\" 11.1 (2003): 53] As an example of this, in his book The Global Genome, Thacker looks to recent developments in tissue engineering where readily apparent techno-mechanical apparatuses disappear altogether so that it appears as though technology is the natural body. Here, in Thacker's words, \\"Technology is thus invisible yet immanent.\\"Thacker, The Global Genome, MIT Press, 2005, p. 267. In this same book, Thacker connects biomedia to a notion of bioart, which he sees as a form of post-media politics conceptualized by French philosopher F√©lix Guattari and the concept of biopolitics in the work of Michel Foucault. Thacker redefines bioart from the common definition of art utilizing biology as its medium to art that makes \\"politically aware, critical, and ethically conscious interventions\\" enabled by nonspecialized engagement with biotechnology.\\"Thacker, The Global Genome, p. 307. He offers as examples Critical Art Ensemble, SubRosa, and the Australia-based art research lab Symbiotica. Thacker is a regular contributor to The Japan Times Books section.See The Japan Times website for more. He has written a column for Mute Magazine called \\"Occultural Studies.\\"Occultural Studies @ Mute Magazine. Thacker has also written the Forewords to the English editions of the works of E.M. Cioran, published by Arcade Press, as well as the Preface and Annotations to Clive Barker's novella Cabal, published by Fiddleblack Press.Cabal & Other Annotations, published by Fiddleblack He is part of the editorial group of Schism Press, an underground philosophy and literary press.https://schismpress.tumblr.com/about.

One reviewer writes of the book: \\"Infinite Resignation belongs on the shelf next to the likes of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer...Like all great works of philosophy, this book will force readers to question their long-held beliefs in the way the world works and the way the world ought to work...Thacker's voice is quiet, a desperate whisper into the void that is both haunting and heartbreaking.\\" Influence In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Nic Pizzolatto, creator and writer of True Detective, cites Thacker's In the Dust of This Planet as an influence on the TV series, particularly the worldview of lead character Rust Cohle, along with several other books: (Ray Brassier's Nihil Unbound, Thomas Ligotti's The Conspiracy Against the Human Race, Jim Crawford's Confessions of an Antinatalist, and David Benatar's Better Never to Have Been).\\"Writer Nic Pizzolatto on Thomas Ligotti and the Weird Secrets of True Detective.\\" In September 2014 the WNYC's Radiolab ran a show entitled \\"In the Dust of This Planet.\\" The program traced the appropriation of Thacker's book of the same name in contemporary art, fashion, music video, and popular culture.\\"Radiolab - In The Dust Of This Planet\\", original broadcast on Monday September 8, 2014. The story was also covered by NPR's On The Media in their show On The Media - Nihilism . Both Thacker's book and the Radiolab podcast were covered by Glenn Beck on TheBlazeTV. Thacker has commented on 'nihilism memes' in an interview for The Awl: \\"Is it any accident that at a time when we have become acutely aware of the challenges concerning global climate change, we have also created this bubble of social media? I find social media and media culture generally to be a vapid, desperate, self-aggrandizing circus of species-specific solipsism ‚Äî ironically, the stupidity of our species might be its only legacy.\\"\\"There's always death to look forward to: Nihilist Arby's and the cheerful nihilism of the Internet\\", by Angela Brussel, The Awl, August 2nd, 2017.

Observations The Security Council called on both Cyprus and Northern Cyprus to urgently address the humanitarian issue of missing persons. It welcomed the Secretary-General Kofi Annan's review of UNFICYP as requested in Resolution 1568 (2004) and his assessment that violence on the island was unlikely, as well as his intention to keep the operation under review.

The credit was given at a rate of 6.2 percent of earned income up to a maximum of $400 for individuals or $800 for married taxpayers. Making Work Pay could be claimed by single filers making between $8,100 per year and $95,000 per year. Joint filers in the range of $8,100 and $190,000 could claim it annually. Withholding formulas directed employers to increase take-home pay immediately without action from employees. Taxpayers with multiple jobs or self-employed had to adjust withholding to avoid inadvertently receiving multiple credits. Workers with multiple jobs, or unemployed, had the option to delay receiving the credit and receive instead a lump sum (all $400 to $800 at once) calculated on the tax return filed in the following year. Reconciling the credit required filing Schedule M with the Form 1040 personal income tax return. The policy concept behind the Making Work Pay tax credit was to stimulate consumer spending, implemented as part of President Barack Obama's stimulus package in 2009. Because Making Work Pay contributed to higher take home pay by reducing withholding, it was assumed that the recipients would spend the majority, if not all, of the credit. The credit was not extended to tax year 2011, and has not been considered since then. The Democratic bill to extend the credit was defeated by the newly elected Republican controlled House of Representatives in 2010.

In 1906 she published her most well-known work, The Root Children (original title: Etwas von den Wurzelkindern, \\"Something about the children from the roots\\"). Life =Childhood= Sibylle von Olfers was born as Maria Regina Angela Hedwig Sibylla von Olfers in the Castle of Metgethen (Schloss Metgethen) on 8 May 1881. The castle was the mansion of Metgethen estate, near K√∂nigsberg. At that time the estate lay within the administration district of Samland, but was incorporated by K√∂nigsberg in 1939. She was the third oldest of the five children of Ernst Friedrich Franz Gustav Werner Marie von Olfers and his second wife Olga Maria Bertha Freiin Behr. Her father was a Health Counsellor, natural scientist and writer. His first marriage was with the older sister of Sibylle's mother with whom he had had four children. Her paternal aunt Marie von Olfers was a major artistic influence. Sibylle grew up in a sheltered childhood and enjoyed, together with her brothers and sisters, education and teaching through governesses and private tutors. The parents as well had a cordial relationship with their numerous children. Sibylle was considered a delicate, intelligent girl who revealed her passion for arts very early. According to the notes of her grandmother, she had the soft face of a Madonna but was called a wild bumblebee because she differed so much from other kids with her fantastic games and ideas. Sibylle was referred to as talented and prettier than ever. The grandmother wrote furthermore that in her early years she didn't learn very well because she preferred to amuse herself with fantasies of games during the lessons. Sibylle von Olfers had a very intimate relationship with her little sister who was born a few years after her. Because of her original ideas and her artistic talent, Sibylle created a very happy and fulfilled life for her sister. The picture-books, which she had written solely for her sister, brought a lot of cheerfulness into the life of the whole family. During her childhood, she sometimes showed a silent, childish religiousness. This could especially be seen when she prayed in front of self-erected altars surrounded by numerous candles or when she modeled Madonnas and drew images of saints per order of her sister.

Born into a well-to-do Lebanese family, Abu Shabaki became interested in poetry at a young age. The son of a merchant, he was left fatherless in his youth, an experience that would mark his earlier works. Elias worked as a teacher, translator and _in addition to publishing several volumes of poetry_ as a journalist writing for many Arabic newspapers and literary magazines. Being an adherent to the Romantic school, Abu Shabki believed in inspiration and denounced conscious control in poetry. His poems were gloomy, deeply personal and often contained biblical overtones centering on his internal moral conflicts. Some of Abu Shabaki's work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection Serpents of Paradise which was regarded as obscene due to its overt sexual content. The poet's obsession with the spiritual consequences of carnality that was manifested in his writings was attributed to the guilt brought upon by his sexual escapades with various women when he was married and until his death from leukemia in 1947. Abu Shabaki called for the renewal and modernization of Arab literature, he inspired succeeding generations of poets. His contributions to literature were commemorated by turning his house in his hometown of Zouk Mikael into a museum. Biography =Childhood and youth= Elias Abu Shabaki was born on 3 May 1903 in Providence, USA to Youssef Abu Shabaki, a wealthy Lebanese merchant, and his wife Nayla n√©e Saroufim. Elias' mother came from a family well known for its poetic gifts, and both Nayla's brother and maternal uncle (Elias Ferzan) were established poets. The couple had left the Lebanon to visit Nayla's uncle Elias Ferzan in Providence where she gave birth to Elias at Ferzan's place. In 1904, Youssef and Nayla settled back in their native town of Zouk Mikael in the current Keserwan District in Mount Lebanon, a town overlooking the Mediterranean Sea which is noted for its natural beauty. Elias was raised as a devout Christian by his Maronite parents; he was admitted in 1911 to the Lazarist Saint Joseph College in the nearby town of Aintoura where he studied, among other courses, French and Arabic literature. Nayla introduced Elias to Arabic poetry and taught him a long poem written by her uncle Elias Ferzan, which, according to the young Abu Shabaki, was highly inspirational. In 1914, while Elias' father was visiting his estates in the Khartoum region in Sudan, he was attacked by bandits who stripped him of his belongings and killed him; the loss of his father left young Elias in a state of emotional distress and depression that would mark the rest of his life. The orphaned Elias continued his education at Aintoura until the outbreak of the Great War when he had to quit the school due to financial problems, though the school was later forced to close by the Ottoman authorities. Elias resumed his studies at the College Central in Jounieh which was run then by the Marist Brothers before returning a year later to Saint Joseph's but he never graduated as a result of a quarrel he had with one of his teachers; nevertheless he continued his self-education and read religious books and French Romantic literature extensively which inspired his first literary efforts. Among the French authors, Elias was particularly fond of the works of Charles Baudelaire and Alfred de Musset. =Courtship and marriage= When he was 16, Elias met and was infatuated by his neighbor Olga Saroufim who was two years his senior. Their friendship rapidly evolved as they exchanged literary books and letters. Elias' attachment to Olga was most evident when she fell ill with fever during a visit to the southern city of Sour; Elias was reported to have invited his family members to kneel and pray for Olga to get better. After some 10 years of betrothal, Abu Shabaki wedded Olga in December 1931. Elias and Olga had a lone child together who died at birth in 1932. =Career= Having lost his father at an early age, Elias was compelled to teach in order to earn a living. He taught for a while at the Jesuit mission school then at the school of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Gemmayze and lastly at the Makassed school. Elias had had an affinity for journalism since his youth, and he eked a meager living through his contributions to a number of Lebanese newspapers (al-Bayraq, al- Bayan, an-Nidaa, al-Ma'rad, al-'assifa, Lisan al-hal, al-Joumhour, al-Makshouf and Sawt al-Ahrar), also publishing a great number of journalistic articles on a variety of topics. Elias also corresponded with a number of Egyptian newspapers such as al-Moktataf and al-Masa. At the request of his publishers, Abu Shabaki translated to Arabic a number of French literary material from the 17th till the 19th century such as Lamartine's Jocelyn and La Chute d'un ange, Edmond Rostand's La Samaritaine, Bernardin St. Pierre's Paul et Virginie and La Chaumi√®re indienne and many other works by Henri Bordeaux, Voltaire, Antoine Fran√ßois Pr√©vost, and Moliere. Elias was employed during World War II as a translator in the press and radio services of the French high Commission. In 1926 Elias produced his first poetic juvenilia al-Kithara (The lyre); the work attests of the young poet's inexperience but also of his promising talent. In 1928 Elias finished al-Marid as-samit (The silent invalid), a narrative poem which is one of Abu Shabaki's best known works, springing from the center of European romantic tradition. His next book Afa'i al-Firdaws (Serpents of Paradise), published in 1938, is lauded by many as Abu Shabaki's best work and one of the best accomplishments of romantic poetry in modern Lebanese and Arabic literature. Afa'i al Firdaws and Elias' latter works would play an influential role in the development of modern Arabic poetry and literature. In 1941 Elias published his third book al-Alhan (The melodies), an ode to simple peasant life, followed in 1944 by Nidaa' al-Qalb (The heart's evocation) and Ila al-Abad (Eternally), where Elias reverts to discussing matters of the heart from a more mature perspective. Ghalwaa was published in 1945. The book's title is an anagram of Olga's name in Arabic. In addition to poetry, Elias published a number of studies including a study in comparative literature called Rawabith al-fikr wal-ruh bayn al-Arab wal-Franja (Intellectual and spiritual links between the Arabs and the French), in which he sought to demonstrate the weight of French influence on world literature; he also authored long essays about Lamartine, Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde. In addition, Abu Shabaki produced a series of portraits of literary and political personages which were first published in al-Maarad journal then collected in a volume dubbed al-Rusum (The Portraits). =Death= Elias died on January 27, 1947 from Leukemia at the H√¥tel-Dieu de France Hospital in Beirut, he was buried in his hometown of Zouk Mikael. After his death, Elias' friends put together a number of verses and works that were published in periodicals in a book dubbed Min Sa'id al-Aliha (From the bosom of the Gods) in 1958. Views and beliefs =Morality= Elias was raised a devout Christian by his Maronite parents in the Lebanese countryside. His religious schooling and upbringing is reflected in his deeply spiritual writings and his resort to the Bible for some of his poems, which reflects the strong hold it had upon him. Elias developed a consuming obsession with the opposing forces of good and evil, awakened at an early age due to the loss of his father at the beginning of World War I; early writings attest to the young poet's disgust and disenchantment with human existence. This is best manifested in a poem entitled Qathoora (Defilement). Abu Shabaki's stances and the subjects he treated were considered provocative and scandalous at the time. He forthrightly and fearlessly confronted matters of sin, sexuality and immorality in a deeply personal manner. Even though he was one of the first Arab literary figures to bluntly address these taboo issues, Abu Shabaki drew praise for his innovative style. During the course of his lengthy engagement to Olga, Elias had a torrid love affair with a married woman that is subliminally confessed in his writing of Ghalwa and Serpents of Paradise, where the remorseful Elias engages in constant conflict between lust and love and the struggle to reconcile sensual bestiality with spirituality. Despite Abu Shabaki's celebration of carnal pleasures, he retained his belief in God whose judgement he feared; his poems show a concern for the spiritual expenses that these pleasures entail. =Women and sexuality= Some scholarsRobin Ostle in Between Heaven and Hell: Sin and Sexuality in the Poetry of Ilyas Abu Shabaka (1903‚Äì1947), Representations of the Divine in Arabic Poetry. Gert Borg and Ed de Moor (Eds.).Orientations 5, Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam-Atlanta, 2001, pp183-193 argue that Elias was a misogynist as attested at an early stage in his works such as this passage from al-Kithara: \\" Beware of love! In love is evil, it is a fire in the heart which melts. If there is a deceitful heart in men, then the hearts of women are more so.\\"Al-Kithara, (Beirut 1926) p.35. Elias epitomized beautiful lewd women as diabolical creatures, cunning temptresses causing man's downfall and \\"Serpents of Paradise\\"; this bitter and ironical antithesis is an allusion to danger and evil that is brought upon by lust and sin. Elias' aversion and attraction to women and sex is evident in the poem \\"Storm\\" where the disturbed poet condemns a prostitute while asking her to make love; similarly in \\"The Wretched Woman\\", Abu Shabaki depicts a prostitute who inflicts her clients with venereal diseases as a way to avenge herself. Elias' attitude towards women softened and changed radically as attest his later works as he went through a process of reconciliation and redemption through love. Despite his views Elias was romantically involved with at least four women according to his biographer Razzuk Faraj Razzuk. Olga Saroufim whom Abu Shabaki married in 1931 was the main love of his life yet he had an affair with Rose, a married woman in his hometown, while he was engaged to marry in 1929. Elias alludes to this experience in many of his writings, especially his book \\"Serpents of Paradise\\". The third woman to mark Abu Shabaki's life, albeit in a minor role, was an Egyptian singer called Hadia who exercised a calming effect on Abu Shabaki, as evidenced by the poem written for her. After having parted with the singer, in 1940 Elias met a dancer called Leila Adem; the poems in \\"The Call of the Heart\\" and \\"To Eternity\\" were written for her. Abu Shabaki's relationship with Leila continued until his death in 1947. Writing Abu Shabaki's was a prolific writer, publishing a wide variety of works including poems, journal articles and literary studies. Widely seen as his most important work was Afa'i al- Firdaws (1938). Elias' writing is characterized by powerful imagery, realism and often a striking carnality and obsession with the pleasures of the flesh. Elias believed that the purest art evolves from emotion, which he thought was the source of authentic and aesthetic experience; he set a high value for inspiration and denounced rationalism and the role of conscious control in writing poetry. In one poem Abu Shabaki wrote that truthful poetry is the best, contrary to the old Arabic saying that the best poetry is that which feigns most. =Influences= The many hardships and emotional challenges that Abu Shabaki endured, from growing up fatherless amid the First World War to losing his only born son, influenced his gloomy poetry which conveys a strong sense of the presence of evil in the world and an effort to find an escape in love or in the innocence of childhood and nature. Elias' often pessimistic writings evoked a concern for the body and its lust, greatly affected by Romantic works he had read during his youth which commended loneliness, sorrow, passion, pain and death and denounced the materialism and lewdness of city life. Christian tradition and imagery inspired and permeated much of Abu Shabaki's work, which abounds in biblical images, mirroring the experiences of a Christian who felt deeply about the teachings of the Catholic Church. =League of ten= In 1930, Abu Shabaki along with Michel Abou Shahla, Khalil Takieddin and Fouad Hobeish, co-founded a literary society conveniently dubbed the \\"League of ten\\" () since it at first included ten literary and artistic figures. In addition to the four founding members, the league consisted of Karam Ali Melhem Karam, Youssef Ibrahim Yazbek, Takieddin al-Solh, Toufic Youssef Awwad, Abdallah Lahoud and Michel Asmar. The league waged an assiduous attack on literary figures and the political establishment through articles published in the periodical al-Maarad, which was subsequently forced to close down by the government. The league's aim was to promote literary renewal and modernization of Arab literature.Al-Rusum, (Beirut 1929) =Publications= Al-Kithara Elias' first Diwan, al-Kithara (The Lyre), was published in 1926 by Sader publishers. Al-Kithara was Elias' earliest work, attesting of the young poet's inexperience while revealing his great poetic potential. The juvenilia that showed the influence of classical Arab poets such as Abu Nuwas was described as gloomy and pretentious. It contained a number of poems translated from French and was dedicated to the spirit of Abu Shabaki's dead father; the dedication established the melancholy and pessimistic mood that pervade the Diwan. Al-Marid as-samet Al-Marid as-samet (The Silent Invalid) was Elias' second juvenilia. It was published in 1928 and was the poet's first trial at narrative poetry. Ghalwaa Abu Shabaka's narrative poem Ghalwaa was written between the years 1926 and 1932 but wasn't published until 1945 by Sader Press, two years before the poet's death. The poem was inspired by Elias' love interest and muse Olga; the poem's title is an anagram of Olga's name in Arabic (ÿ£ŸàŸÑÿ∫ÿß=ÿ∫ŸÑŸàÿßÿ°). It was viewed ever since its publication as an influential and progressive work which revolutionized Arabic literature and as a prime example of Arabic romanticism. The generally acclaimed masterpiece owed its success to its sheer artistic merit, impressive length and the juxtaposition of extreme emotional and moral situations such as passion and sin. Although Mahjarite writers had produced similar long poems, they seldom engaged in poems with such clear narrative plot. Afa'i al- Firdaws Afa'i al-Firdaws (Serpents of Paradise) is a collection of 13 poems written between 1928 and 1938 and published in 1938 by the now-defunct Dar al-Makshouf publishing press. The book is highly regarded as a masterpiece of Lebanese poetry; it draws inspiration from love and eroticism in a clear connection to the influences of French romantic works such as Charles Baudelaire's Les fleurs du mal. In Serpents of Paradise, Elias' candid and puritanical morality gives way to a sense of sin and spiritual deprivation as he comes to terms with the effects of the love affair that he had while he was betrothed to Olga. The Diwan is characterized by constant antithesis between love and deceit, life and death. Al-Alhan Al-Alhan (The melodies) is an anthology encompassing 16 poems. Al-Alhan was published in 1941 by Dar al- Makshouf, it was described as a unique work in the history of Arabic literature; each of the poems deal with a different aspect of rustic country life, where images of Lebanese folklore and colloquialism abound. In the book, Abu Shabaki identifies himself with the peasant, praises the simplicity of traditional ways, and furthers himself from the spurious gifts of technology and displays of false riches. Eliyah Hawi, a contemporary literary figure, saw Abu Shabaki's poem as calling to a form of new paganism where Abu Shabaki \\"worships the blessing and fertility of the Earth womb.\\" Through al-Alhan, Abu Shabaki paved the way for a new trend among his contemporary Muslim poets which manifested in a return to Islamic Sufism or to pre-Islamic natural atheism such in the case of Adunis. Nidaa al-Qalb and Ila al-Abad Published in 1942 by Dar al-Makshouf, Nidaa al-Qalb (The Call of the Heart) is a collection of love poems. In this volume, Elias placed aside his view of Woman as an evil snare and extolled chaste love, in a striking contrast with the harsh judgement and hedonistic pursuits expressed in Afai al-firdaws. In the poem The Cup, Abu Shabaki, having recovered peace and his faith in love, accepts his predicament as a poet who is unappreciated by his society. Ila al- Abad (To Eternity) was the last of Abu Shabaki's works published during his lifetime, the anthology confirmed Elias' return to peace that was evidenced in The Call of the Heart. The crude sensuality of his earlier works are totally replaced with more refined and mystical dimensions of love that are further emphasized in this book which was also issued by Dar al-Makshouf in 1944. Legacy Elias is considered a cornerstone in modern Arabic poetry in Lebanon and one of the greatest Arab poets; he is also one of the leading Lebanese figures of Arabic romanticism. His revival of the romantic school, long dormant in the Occident, was pursued by a large following of Arab contemporary poets and writers. The romantic movement is now outdated in the Middle East but Abu Shabaka's work still attracts young readers who appreciate sentimentality and poetry and have little taste for the socio-political raptness found in the work of modern, politically engaged Arab poets. Abou Shabaki's work confirmed the Christian tradition in modern Arabic literature and helped establish the Bible as a literary source in Arabic. Later writers and poets benefited from the revival of biblical themes and legends which Abu Shabaki's poetry portrayed. The poet influenced the writings of many of his successors like Badr Shakir al-Sayyab, Nizar Qabbani, Khalil Hawi, Henry Zgheib and Adunis. =Elias Abu Shabaki Museum= On 11 June 2008, the Zouk Mikael municipality inaugurated the Elias Abu Shabaki museum in the poet's home. Abu Shabaki's mansion in Zouk Mikael was built by his father and uncle, who traded goods between Egypt, Sudan and Lebanon. The mansion was designed by an Egyptian architect, built by local stonemasons and its interior walls were decorated by Austrian artists. In the later years of his life, Elias had mortgaged his house due to his poor financial condition. The municipality appropriated the plot in the 1970s and saved the house and its gardens from being replaced by a residential building. The mansion was restored during the next 2 decades and was refurbished with the original furniture and accessories of the poet that were saved by his wife's family; in addition to the furniture, the museum houses a collection of the poet's books, original manuscripts and letters.

Taylor is also co-founder of The Legacy Center, an organization devoted to helping individuals and organizations identify and preserve the values and stories that have shaped their lives. He was a contributing editor of Books and Culture. A recurring topic in Taylor‚Äôs work is the role of stories in shaping lives. He points out that we are born into stories, live in stories, and die leaving a legacy of stories. Stories, he argues, are the single best way human beings have discovered for preserving and making sense of their experience, and understanding this increases one‚Äôs ability to make one‚Äôs own life story a rich one. In addition to his books and articles, Taylor has served as a stylist for several Bible translations, including the New Living Translation and a revision of the New Century Version. He also co-produced the newly released The Expanded Bible. Taylor received his B.A. from Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California and an M.A. and Ph.D in English from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He taught literature and writing at Bethel University for thirty-three years. Personal life Taylor is married and the father of four children. He currently resides in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Biography Joseph Rockwell Swan was born at Westernville, Oneida County, New York. He studied at an academy in Aurora, New York, where he began the study of law. He moved to Columbus, Ohio in 1824, and studied law at the office of his uncle, Judge Gustavus Swan, where he was soon admitted to the bar.Smith 1898 : 30-31 Swan's first office was prosecuting attorney of Franklin County, to which he was appointed in 1830 by the judges of the Common Pleas. In 1833, a statute was passed which made the office elective, and in October of that year, the voters of Franklin County chose Swan. Within a year, the legislature chose him for judge of the Common Pleas Court, with a grueling circuit of Franklin, Madison, Clark, Champaign, Logan, Union, and Delaware counties, with the legislature electing him in 1834 and again in 1841.Reed 1897: 109-112 Swan resigned from the court in 1845, and formed the partnership of Swan and Andrews in Columbus, with John W. Andrews as junior partner, until 1854.Randall 1912: 133-140 In 1850, the General Assembly passed an act calling a convention to revise or amend the constitution of the state of Ohio, and Judge Swan was elected as a delegate from Franklin County. In 1854 he won election to the Ohio Supreme Court. Ohio Supreme Court In 1854, Swan ran for the Ohio Supreme Court as an Anti-Nebraska Party candidate, and defeated his Democratic opponent by 188,000 to 109,000.Smith 1898 : 27 His most important decision came in 1859, and cost him re-nomination by the Republicans. This case involved Simeon Bushnell, who, along with Charles Langston, was convicted by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and imprisoned for rescuing a fugitive slave in an event known as the Oberlin‚ÄìWellington Rescue. The case was appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, where Swan was in the majority of a 3-2 decision to deny release on grounds that the United States Supreme Court had found the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was constitutional. If they had ruled for release, Governor Chase was prepared to use the militia. To do what? This may have precipitated the Civil War in Ohio that year.Neff 1921: 214-215 In closing, Swan contrasted his personal views with his need to adhere to the Constitution: This famous decision ended Swann's legal career, as he expected it would.Randall 1912: 135‚Äì136 Abolitionists in the Republican party saw to it that he was denied re- nomination at the party convention that year. He resigned in November 1859, a short time before his five-year term would have expired.Justices of the Supreme Court of Ohio 1787 - Present Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted He never again sought public office or practiced law. When Judge Gholson died in 1862 and passions had cooled somewhat, Governor Brough offered his seat on the Supreme Court to Swan, but he declined. In 1860, Swan was chosen president of the Columbus and Xenia Railroad Company; he was also chief legal advisor of that company and of the Little Miami Railroad. In 1869 he was appointed general solicitor of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway Company, where he served for ten years, until failing health compelled resignation. When Swan died at his home in Columbus in 1884, he left three sons and two daughters. His funeral was at Trinity Church, and burial was at Green Lawn Cemetery, Columbus, Ohio, next to his wife, Hanna Ann Andrews, originally from Rochester, New York, whom he had married in January of 1833.The Supreme Court of Ohio and The Ohio Judicial System - Joseph Rockwell Swan After Swan's death, the Franklin County Bar Association prepared a memorial, written by Richard A. Harrison, Allen G. Thurman, Chauncey N. Olds, and others. It read, in part: Writings According to the Ohio Supreme Court web site, Swan's legal guidebooks were \\"perhaps [his] most important contribution to Ohio jurisprudence\\".

The overhand (or overhead) throw is a single-handed throw of a projectile where the object is thrown above the shoulder. The overhand throw is a complex motor skill that involves the entire body in a series of linked movements starting from the legs, progressing up through the pelvis and trunk, and culminating in a ballistic motion in the arm that propels a projectile forward. It is used almost exclusively in athletic events. The throwing motion can be broken down into three basic steps: cocking, accelerating, and releasing. Desired qualities in the action produce a fast, accurate throw. These qualities are affected by the physical attributes of the thrower like height, strength, and flexibility. However it is mainly the throwing motion mechanics and the thrower's ability to coordinate them that determines the quality of the throw. Determining the desired qualities of the throwing motion is difficult to assess due to the extremely short amount of time that it takes professionals to perform the motion. The motion In the overhead throwing motion the body is a kinetic chain, and the efficiency of the kinetic chain determines the quality of the throw (velocity and accuracy of the projectile). The thrower uses muscle segments throughout the whole body to transfer potential energy from the lower extremities to the upper extremities where it is then transformed into kinetic energy as the projectile is released.Seroyer, Shane. \\"The Kinetic Chain in Overhand Pitching\\", Sports Health March/April 2010 This throwing motion is described based on the analysis of professional athletes, mainly baseball pitchers, as they are recognized as having mastered this skill. There are variations in the throwing motion unique to the thrower, but generally the throwing motion is performed as follows. =Starting position= Proper technique for the start of the overhead throwing motion involves the thrower's body facing approximately 90 degrees from the intended target, with the throwing arm on the opposite side. =Cocking= The first stage of the throwing motion includes the time from the start of the motion to when the shoulder has reached its maximum external rotation. The throwing motion is initiated by first taking a stride toward the target with the leg opposite of the throwing arm. The stride foot should be in line with the thrower's stance foot and the target; placing the foot wide from the target creates a breakdown of the motion due to over-rotation of the pelvis, and placing the foot inward from the target forces the thrower to throw across his or her body. The purpose of the stride is to increase the distance over which linear and angular trunk motions occur, allowing more energy to be produced and transferred up the body. The stride step is performed while raising the throwing arm back to the point of maximum external shoulder rotation. At this point the arm is fully ‚Äúcocked‚Äù. It is important to note that the ball does not move forward during the cocking stage.Pappas, Arthur. \\"Biomechanics of baseball pitching\\" The American Journal of Sports Medicine July 1985 =Acceleration= The acceleration phase is initiated once the projectile begins its forward motion, which is also about the same time as the stride foot makes contact with the ground. The acceleration phase is the most explosive part of the overhead throwing motion, as the projectile's velocity increases from zero to its maximum velocity in this short amount of time. The ball is brought forward while the thrower's body rotates towards the target starting from the stride foot, moving up to the pelvis, followed by the trunk and spinal rotation, and then up to the shoulders. Although not visibly obvious, trunk muscular control is an important factor in high velocity throwing Hong, Di-An. \\"A three-dimensional, six-segment chain analysis of forceful overarm throwing\\" Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology April 2001 During this phase the thrower's trunk will tilt to the side opposite the throwing arm to allow for greater distance of acceleration, which transfers more energy to the projectile. The acceleration phase ends at the time of the projectile's release from the hand, at which point it has attained its maximum velocity. =Release and follow-through= Where the ball is released depends on the distance of the thrower's target; a farther target requires a higher release point and the same applies conversely. The purpose of the follow- through is to decelerate the throwing arm. Once the projectile is released the throwing arm keeps moving across the body. This rapid deceleration is actually the most violent part of the throwing motion, as the greatest amount of joint loading occurs at this stage. For professional baseball pitchers the leg opposite the stride leg also steps forward and squares the pitcher with his target. Uses The main use of the overhead throwing motion is for competitive sports, including: *Baseball *Quarterback position in American football *Water Polo *Javelin Throw *Cricket *Dodgeball *Axe Throwing Related injuries Frequent use of the overhead throwing motion at high performance levels, such as by professional athletes, can lead to injury. This is due to the large amount of stress placed on the elbow and shoulder, which are the most common areas injured. These injuries can include but are not limited to:Fleisig, Glenn. \\"Kinetics of Baseball Pitching with Implications About Injury Mechanisms\\" The American Journal of Sports Medicine March 1995 = Elbow injuries = *Torn ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint (requires Tommy John surgery) *Injury to the common flexor tendon = Shoulder injuries = *Injury to the rotator cuff *Injury to the labrum *Scapular dyskinesia = Abdominal injuries = *Injury to the oblique muscles References Category:Biomechanics Category:Motor skills Category:Motor control Category:Throwing ","title":"Overhand throw"},{"id":"30627909","text":"St. Urban Apartments on Central Park West.

It is used as an aid in washing the body, for example, to apply soap to the body, and to remove the soap with a rinsed out washing mitt. It can also be used to freshen up the face. Usually, a towel is used to dry off the body afterwards. A washing mitt is especially useful for people that like to wash themselves at a sink, and do not wish to spill or waste much water. The washing mitt is also a good tool for nurses and caregivers, who wash their patients in their beds. An expansion on the washing mitt is the showercloth, with which also the back can be washed. There are also special sponges which can be used in the shower, or in the bathtub, in combination with a shower gel.

Typically, lotteries pay out around 50‚Äì70% of stakes (turnover) back to players. The remainder is then kept for administration costs and charitable donations or tax revenues. In gambling terminology lottery payouts are the equivalent of RTP or returns to players. The lottery operator's gross margin is the opposite of RTP. Actual payouts after a draw will vary to what payouts are advertised before a draw, depending on whether the jackpot is hit or not. Typically jackpot amounts that are not hit or paid out are then rolled over to the next draw. In this sense, typical RTP or returns to player percentages will vary with the size of the jackpot. It can happen that after several rollovers, a jackpot becomes that large that there is real 'positive RTP; with a lottery ticket, i.e. if you were to buy every single ticket you would make a profit after your ticket costs. This will of course also depend on your chances of sharing or not sharing the jackpot with another player, any taxes payable plus whether you are taking the cash or annuity option or not (as available). In the US, large lottery winnings generally are advertised as an annuity amount, paid in 20 or more installments; in most cases, a cash option is available. The cash option in the US can be 40‚Äì60% of the advertised annuity amount. Legislation varies by US jurisdiction; many statutes specify a minimum payout percentage. To make lotteries competitive, some jurisdictions increase payout percentages versus those of a neighboring lottery. The percentage changes are likely due to competition from illegal numbers on daily numbers games.

He served during the long campaign in the Mediterranean as part of a division under the command of Samuel Hood. He was with Lord Nelson in Corsica in 1794 when he nearly succumbed to dysentery and malaria. Weatherhead was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent and was mortally wounded during the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Background Weatherhead was born in July 1775 and baptised in Brancaster, Norfolk on 18 July 1775. The son of the local rector, the Reverend Thomas Weatherhead. At the age of 17, he joined the Royal Navy and was, along with William Hoste, one of a group of boys from Norfolk who went to sea in the year of 1793, and who served under Horatio Nelson. Naval campaigns =Mediterranean= Weatherhead joined as a midshipman, shortly after Nelson was appointed her captain Agamemnon was part of a squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral Hotham, sent to the Mediterranean with the intention of establishing naval superiority. Joined later by Admiral Samuel Hood's fleet, the force sailed initially to Gibraltar and then Toulon, arriving in July. Toulon was largely under the control of moderate republicans and royalists, but was under threat from the forces of the National Convention. The city authorities therefore requested that Hood take the city under his protection and the Agamemnon was sent first to the Sardinia and then Naples to request reinforcements. The requests were successful, and 2,000 men and several ships were mustered by mid-September. The force arrived back in Toulon on 5 October to find that the French army had occupied the hills surrounding the city and was bombarding it. Hoping the town could hold out, Hood sent Agamemnon to join a squadron operating off Cagliari. On the way they encountered a French Squadron. Nelson promptly gave chase, firing on the 40-gun Melpomene. The Agamemnon inflicted considerable damage but the remaining four French ships turned to join the battle and, realising he was outnumbered, Nelson withdrew and continued to Cagliari, arriving on 24 October. =Corsica= On 26 October, after Agamemnon had been repaired, Weatherhead found himself on the way to Tunis with a squadron under Commodore Robert Linzee. On arrival, Nelson was given command of a small squadron consisting of the Agamemnon, three frigates and a sloop, and ordered to blockade the French garrison on Corsica. The fall of Toulon at the end of December 1793 meant the Agamemnon's mission to Corsica had added significance, as it could provide the British a naval base close to the French coast. Hood therefore sent reinforcements during January 1794. A British assault force landed on the island on 7 February, and the squadron moved to intensify the blockade off Bastia. For the rest of the month it carried out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. Towards the end of the month, troops under Lieutenant-General David Dundas entered the outskirts of Bastia.After surveying the enemy positions, they withdrew, Dundas claiming that the French were too well entrenched to risk an assault. Nelson disagreed and a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders followed. By late March the arguments had been resolved and Nelson began to land guns from his ships and emplace them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour and opened fire, whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment. After 45 days, the town surrendered. Nelson subsequently prepared for an assault on Calvi, working in company with Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart. It was around this time that Weatherhead contracted both dysentery and malaria, a combination that almost killed him. =HMS Captain= by James Fittler and Nicholas Pocock It is unclear how long Weatherhead was laid up for but he was certainly fit for duty in the June 1796 when Agamemnon was sent home for urgent repairs, and Weatherhead, along with Nelson, transferred to the third-rate, . After overseeing the evacuation of British nationals from Leghorn and transporting them to Corsica, Captain was ordered to blockade the newly captured French port. In July she oversaw the occupation of Elba, but by September the Genoese had broken their neutrality to declare in favour of the French. By October, the Genoese position and the continued French advances led the British to decide that the Mediterranean Fleet could no longer be supplied; they ordered it to be evacuated to Gibraltar. Weatherhead was also present during the withdrawal from Corsica. In December 1796 Nelson moved his flag to the frigate HMS Minerve, covering the evacuation of the garrison at Elba, HMS Captain being deemed too large and slow for the operation. Nelson returned to HMS Captain in time to take part in the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797. =Cape St Vincent= Battle of Cape St Vincent by Robert Cleveley At the battle of Cape St Vincent, on 14 February 1797, Captain was to the rear of the British line. Instead of continuing to follow the line, Nelson disobeyed orders from the commander in chief, Sir John Jervis and wore ship, breaking from the line and heading to engage the Spanish van, which consisted of the 112-gun , the 80-gun and the 130-gun Sant√≠sima Trinidad. Captain engaged all three, assisted by which had come to her aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides, Captain found herself alongside the San Nicolas. Nelson led a boarding party across and forced her surrender. San Josef attempted to come to the San Nicolas‚Äôs aid, but became entangled with her compatriot and was left immobile. Nelson led his party from the deck of the San Nicolas onto the San Josef and captured her as well. After the battle, the Spanish sought refuge in Cadiz where they were subsequently blockaded by the British. =HMS Theseus= In May 1797, joined Jervis's fleet. The Theseus was a troubled ship and the crew were bordering on mutinous. Jervis saw the officers in charge as responsible and requested that Nelson take over. Nelson took with him a number of his trusted followers including Midshipman William Hoste and the newly promoted Lieutenant John Weatherhead. Weatherhead must have played a part in suppressing the half mutinous crew. A letter from the crew stated, \\"We thank the Admiral (Nelson) for the Officers he has placed over us\\". On 27 May 1797, Theseus was ordered to lie off Cadiz to monitor the Spanish fleet and await the arrival of Spanish treasure ships from the American colonies. On 3 July, Theseus took part in a bombardment and an amphibious assault on the port. =Santa Cruz de Tenerife= Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife by Francisco de Aguilar The battle plan for the assault on Santa Cruz called for a combination of naval bombardments and an amphibious landing. The initial attempt was called off after adverse currents hampered the assault and the element of surprise was lost. Nelson immediately ordered another assault but this was beaten back. He prepared for a third attempt, to take place during the night. Although he personally led one of the battalions, the operation ended in failure: the Spanish were better prepared than had been expected and had secured strong defensive positions. Several of the boats failed to land at the correct positions in the confusion, while those that did were swept by gunfire and grapeshot. Nelson's boat reached its intended landing point but as he stepped ashore he was hit in the right arm by a musketball, which fractured his humerus bone in multiple places. Weatherhead was in Nelson's boat that night and managed to get ashore under a hail of shot, but was hit in the stomach. One of the Spaniards, Bernardo C√≥logan, found Weatherhead on the beach near death. C√≥logan used his shirt to bandage Weatherhead and arranged for his returned to the Theseus. However, Weatherhead's condition did not improve and he died four days later on 29 July 1797. Nelson wrote in a letter to Weatherhead's father, \\"...Believe me I have largely partaken in our real cause for grief in the loss of a most excellent young man\\", and \\"....when I reflect on that fatal night I cannot but bring sorrow and his fall before my eyes\\".

Background  Gregory Floyd began his career as a hospital police officer over twenty years ago. A committed worker, Floyd became the youngest hospital police captain in the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporations‚Äô (HHC) history, at the age of 27. HHC is the largest municipal healthcare organization in the U.S. Soon after, Gregory became the vice president of the New York City Hospital Police Guardians Association, and in 1994, he was appointed as Teamsters local 237 deputy director for peace officer titles. Floyd‚Äôs success continued, as later that year he was appointed secretary to the New York State AFL-CIO‚Äôs Committee of Peace and Law Enforcement Officers. It was not until 1999 that Floyd became the director of Local 237‚Äôs Citywide Division, where his notoriety grew when he acted as a key player in the fight to save the title of ‚Äòhospital police special officer‚Äô from elimination, due to privatization. Four years later, at the beginning of 2003, Floyd was elected to serve as a trustee on Local 237's executive board, just a year before he was also made the union's secretary- treasurer and chief negotiator. All of these positions led to Gregory Floyd's eventual rise to become the union's fifth president in its 55-year history, on March 30, 2007, when he was appointed by the Union's executive board. In November 2009, Floyd won his first election, continuing as Union President.  Current appointments  As president of Local 237, the largest local in the 1.4 million Teamsters Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), Floyd represents a varied group of 25,000 New York employees from both New York City agencies and the Housing Authority, ranging from school safety agents and taxi inspectors to x-ray technicians and city attorneys. The Union also represents blue and white collar workers employed by municipalities and school districts throughout Long Island. Gregory Floyd presently serves as a trustee to the board of the New York City Employee Retirement System (NYCERS), one of the largest public pension funds in the United States. He also serves as a commissioner of the board of the IBT Human Rights Commission (he was appointed by IBT General President James P. Hoffa), while also holding a seat on the board of Group Health Insurance (GHI), and the Health Insurance Plan of New York (HIP). In addition, Floyd serves as the vice president of the New York State AFL-CIO and the New York Central Labor Council, as well serving as a trustee of Teamsters Joint Council 16. He is also on the board of trustees for the Council for Unity, an organization based in New York that promotes safety and unity in schools and communities around the city.  2010 Local 237 Presidential Election  After being appointed president of Local 237 and serving for two years, Floyd was elected to his first full term in 2009.  Contract negotiations  In his years as Local 237's chief negotiator Floyd has attained contracts that provide reasonable wage increases, and that have maintained health and pension benefits for Local 237 union members.  Advocacy  Gregory Floyd is a strong advocate for maintaining affordable housing, rallying to ensure that people are not left homeless from the privatization of housing in densely populated areas. He has continuously fought and rallied to ensure that affordable housing is available to those who require it, and has successfully lobbied State and Federal agencies to obtain the funds necessary for the upkeep and maintenance of the New York City Housing Authority. Floyd organized a large contingent of public employees to attend the One Nation Rally in October, 2010, in Washington D.C. Floyd is the host of Reaching Out With Greg Floyd, a public affairs program that airs on WWRL AM 1600 and cable TV channels throughout New York City. He is a frequent guest and commentator on local and national news programs.  Personal life  Gregory Floyd is married to writer Wendy Bolton Floyd, the author of When Did You Know ...

Elizabeth had married James Courtenay as her second husband, having first married Lewis Rosier (d.1676) of Swimbridge, whose monument can be seen in St James's Church, Swimbridge.\\"North wall north aisle large wall monument with small urns flanking achievement above shouldered surround with puttis to each side and winged skull below to Lewis Rosier d.1676 with original painted decoration\\".

He entered the United States Naval Academy in 1874, but was not commissioned as an ensign until 1883. He served aboard many ships before becoming one of the inaugural members of the General Board of the United States Navy. Afterward, he commanded both and . After becoming governor in 1914, Maxwell instituted a number of reforms, including establishing the Bank of Guam and the Guam Insular Patrol Force. He also reorganized the tax system and stressed the building and improvement of new roads. His plans to give Guamanians United States citizenship was rejected by then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Guam became the center an international relations incident when the German made port there asking for coal at a time when the United States remained neutral in World War I. Maxwell refused to break neutrality by providing fuel and supplies, forcing the ship to stay in port for the next two years. Maxwell attracted controversy during his term, particularly when he approved the first execution on the island since the US takeover. Eventually, a lower-ranking officer, William P. Cronan, placed Maxwell on the sick list, despite his protest, and removed him from power, taking the office himself. The Navy launched an inquiry into the appropriateness and motives of the dismissal, but nonetheless, Maxwell, declared perfectly healthy by mainland doctors, was reassigned to the Naval War College. Naval career Maxwell was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on June 8, 1874. On March 3, 1883, he was commissioned as an ensign junior grade, and an ensign on June 26, 1884. He served aboard the training ship from 1883 to 1885. On July 4, 1893, he was promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade). From July 1890 to March 1891, he served aboard the , before becoming the Assistant to the Inspector of the 5th Lighthouse District in July 1892. In 1900, Maxwell began his assignment aboard . In 1905, as a Lieutenant Commander, he served as Chief Engineer on 's commissioning crew. In 1910 as a Commander, he served as one of the first members of the General Board of the United States Navy. On November 12, 1911, he left Hampton Roads, Virginia commanding , after being placed in command two days before. He continued in this position until 1912. In 1913, he commanded . Governorship Maxwell served as Naval Governor of Guam from March 28, 1914 to April 29, 1916. During his term, a typhoon hit in the summer of 1914, leaving a shortage of rice and corn crops. As governor, he established a number of government organizations, some still in existence. These organizations include the Guam Insular Patrol Force, the civilian predecessor to the Guam Police Department, as well as the Bank of Guam. He reorganized the taxation system by raising property assessments and stressed road building. The bank opened in January 1916 and helped many islanders obtain loans to open small businesses. He also served as the first chairman of the Guamanian chapter of the American Red Cross and organized its first fundraising drive. In 1914, Maxwell proposed granting United States citizenship to the people of Guam. However, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, rejected the plan, claiming that making Guamanians citizens was not in the best interest of the country. He also asked that Guam be made an open port of trade to all ships, believing this would reduce the local's dependence on government assistance for food. In December 1914, Maxwell found himself at the center of a diplomatic incident when the German Empire ship stopped in Guam to resupply on coal. Maxwell, under orders to maintain American neutrality in the recently begun World War I, refused the ship supplies, instead forcing it to voluntarily inter itself at the island for the next two years. Near the end of his term, Maxwell began coming into conflict with the islanders. He attracted some controversy when he outlawed public whistling, hoping to curtail mischievous local boys from whistling an incorrect cadence as sailors marched. He attracted larger anger when he ordered the first execution on the island since the United States had assumed control of it; despite numerous pleas to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, the man, Filipino Pablo Corpus, was executed for murder on February 4, 1916 by hanging. On April 29, 1916, William P. Cronan relieved Maxwell after involuntarily placing him on the sick list. However, upon transportation to the mainland United States, he was found to be perfectly healthy and reassigned to the Naval War College. The Navy launched an inquiry, led by Captain William R. Shoemaker, into the events surrounding Maxwell's dismissal and placement on the list by an officer of a lower rank. It was alleged that Cronan, then aide to the governor, disagreed with several of Maxwell's policies and used improper and unprofessional methods to oust him and take the position for himself. Legacy The Maxwell School, named after the governor, was built in Santa Rita, Guam in the early 1930s, but does not exist today.

Foot Tanning Company is a leather production facility located in Red Wing, Minnesota. It processes leather for use in the crafting of shoes, boots, belts, and leather accessories. In 2010, the factory processed nearly 6 million linear feet of hides. S.B. Foot Tanning Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Red Wing Shoes Company, Inc. and is the principal supplier of leather to their shoe manufacturing plants. The company also supplies over 1.5 million linear feet of leather for use in the production of military footwear per year, extending a tradition that began with World War I, when the tannery supplied boot leathers for the construction of soldier boots. Processing Hides are sourced from Feedlot cattle raised on ranches in Nebraska and Texas which are then run through primary processing in Minnesota and Iowa. The tannery then purchases the pre-processed hides which arrive in a stage of production called \\"Wet Blue,\\" a term applied to animal hides that have been cured in Chromium salts. Wet-Blue hides produce stable leather products that are durable and flexible; and are able to maintain these characteristics over time. Upon arrival, the hides are graded based on the overall thickness and quality of the hide. Once graded, hides are grouped and shaved to a specific thickness. Once a hide has passed through the shaver, it will be more uniform and ready for color tanning. S.B. Foot Tanning Company uses wood drums measuring up to 40 feet in diameter. Wood drums are preferred over steel mainly due to heat absorbing properties. The hides are spun in a float of chemicals and dyes, mostly consisting of oils distilled from different tree barks and vegetation, to stain the hides to desired color. The longer a hide is spun in the barrel, the more time the dyes and oils have to seep into the cells and fibers of the leather. Most of the leather processed will spin long enough for the dyes to fully penetrate the hides. The hides are then dried, removing nearly 90% of the water weight from the hides. Some hides are then processed through additional steps: adding oils, waxes and possibly additional color tone finishes to achieve the desired look and properties. S.B. Foot Tanning Company then packages the hides for shipment to different production facilities. It is estimated that Red Wing Shoe Company uses nearly half of the total shoe leather produced. Environmental Concerns Tanneries process animal skins with the use of chemicals to alter the proteins and produce a durable and flexible product. Whether the tanning process is done using vegetable tanning, chromium salt tanning or another process, solid and water waste are inevitable by-products. Currently, all hides used by S.B. Foot Tanning Company are pre-processed to a ‚Äúwet-blue‚Äù state prior to delivery to the tannery for final tanning and dying. The three stages of Wet-Blue processing (pretanning, tanning, finishing) produce 450‚Äì600 kg of waste per ton of processed leather. 1996 Management of Waste from Animal Product Processing, Section 3: Tanneries The treatment of this waste is governed by EPA rules and regulations. Of this waste, nearly half can be reprocessed or recycled. Lime split can be sold as collagen (25-30% reduction in total waste), waste water treatment solids can be processed and resold as soil fertilizer (10% reduction) and trimmings can be collected and re-packaged for use in making bonded leather products (5% reduction). A second by-product is waste water. 35 m^3 of waste water per ton of raw hide is the average. The highest amount of waste water is produced in the pretanning process as hides are fleshed and split ‚Äì removing any hair or animal debris from the hide. The process used by S.B. Foot Tanning Company and the Wet Blue facilities they source their hides from report a waste water impact of 28 m^3 per ton. Precipitation techniques and fluid-reuse has reduced the total amount of solid and water waste produced. High-exhaustion tanning processes have reduced the use of Chromium salts by 33% and increased the chrome utilization from 70% to 98%, resulting in reduction of chrome discharge (waste) from 3.8 kg/t to 0.05-0.1 kg/t. 2000 UNIDO The Scope for Decreasing Pollution Load in Leather Processing - Ludvik, Biljan Further developments in alternative pre-tanning processes and precipitation recovery/re-use of chemicals continue to be developed. History The company has been in near-continuous operation since 1872 and is the namesake of Silas Buck Foot (S.B. Foot). The original business was built along the shores of Trout Brook in Featherstone Township, just outside Red Wing, MN. The tannery was built to supply the Foot, Schulze & Co's demand for reliable hides that could be fashioned into furry moccasins called \\"shoe pacs,\\" a popular shoe of the time with local farmers and outdoor workers. In the Cash Panic of 1893, the tannery managed to continue daily operations and pay its workers by issuing scrips reading ‚ÄúIn 60 days we promise to pay to the order of bearer the sum of $5.00.‚Äù This tender was treated as cash and accepted by local merchants without discount. The tannery made good on these scrips, redeeming all outstanding scrip in due time.Republican Eagle, First Hundred Years, 41. In April, 1897, the company was renamed and S.B. Foot & Company was formally incorporated. S. B. Foot turned over management of the tannery‚Äôs daily business to his son, Edwin Hawley Foot (E. H. Foot) in 1898. In the early 1900s, the tannery buildings had become a liability - they needed to be rebuilt. S.B. Foot tried, unsuccessfully, to sell the tannery. E.H.‚Äôs enthusiasm in running the tannery business changed S.B. Foot‚Äôs mind and a decision was made to build a new factory. With $250,000 being raised from local Red Wing residents and another $250,000 coming from the Foot family's own finances to help start construction of the new factory in early 1908. Silas Buck Foot would pass away in May of that year ‚Äì leaving the business entirely in the control of E.H. Foot. The company survived the Great Depression, re-organizing as S.B. Foot Tanning Company in the winter of 1932-33. E.H. Foot died July 4, 1957, 100 years after his father had originally arrived in Red Wing. Silas B. Foot II, E.H. Foot's eldest son, then presided over the company until 1972 when E.H. Jr., brother to S.B. Foot II, became president. Silas B. Foot III, the fourth generation of the Foot Family to preside over the business, would become president prior to selling the business to the Red Wing Shoe Company in 1986. Red Wing Shoe Company continues to operate the tannery today. =Silas Buck Foot= Silas Buck Foot (S.B. Foot) was a farmer, inventor and shoemaker who had moved to Minnesota from Pennsylvania in 1857. At this time, Red Wing, Minnesota was a booming hub of Goodhue County, situated on the shores of the Mississippi River with favorable portage and proximity to wheat supplies and the mills in Minneapolis. S. B. was an active member in the local church, fraternal societies and municipal projects, he ‚Äúbecame the president of the Red Wing and Iowa Railroad Company in 1881, hoping to build and operate a railroad from the Great Lakes shipping port of Duluth, through Red Wing, to the agricultural and coal mining region of Iowa.‚Äù \\" Angell, Madeline, Minnesota History, Fall 1981 S.B.

The SSD was a multi-level-cell solid-state drive available in a 2.5\\" form factor, came in 80 GB and 160 GB capacities and utilized NAND flash memory on a 50 nm process. The second-generation SSD which was called the \\"X25-M G2\\". The X25-M G2 was also available in a 2.5\\" form factor and 80 GB and 160 GB capacities, but with NAND flash memory on a more efficient 34 nm process. Overview Around May 2008, rumors and various leaks about a possible mainstream affordable SSD released by Intel surfaced. A couple weeks after, Intel indirectly confirmed the rumors by releasing a promotional video. Intel then released its X25 series of SSDs which consisted of three different drives: The X25-V, X25-M, and X25-E. The letter after each name stands for value, mainstream, and extreme respectively. The X25-M was released in an 80GB capacity with 50 nm NAND flash memory in a 2.5\\" form factor. The 160 GB capacity version came out several months after. Intel then released a 34 nm flash memory version in the middle of 2009. Because Intel used the same exact name for these new drives, the consumers nicknamed the 34 nm SSDs as the \\"X25-M G2\\". A third generation drive called the \\"X25-M G3\\" was rumored to come out in late 2010 but was delayed until early 2011. However, a blog said it was quietly sold on Taobao, a Chinese eBay-esque website. Features Before the X25-M was released, all of the multi-level cell (MLC) drives were the same piece of hardware, but with a different company logo on it. This is called rebranding, which happens often in the computer hardware market, but Intel opted to develop its own MLC drive. The most notable feature about the X25-M is how well it performed in comparison to other MLC and single-level cell (SLC) SSDs. SLC drives are naturally more efficient than MLC drives, however Intel's unique architecture for this MLC drive was much more efficient than the typical MLC drive. To prevent data loss, Intel included additional 7.5‚Äì8% more space (6‚Äì6.4 GB on an 80 GB drive), specifically for reliability purposes. If it ran out of good blocks to write (nearing the end of the drive's lifespan), the SSD will write to this additional space on the drive. =TRIM support= X25-M G2 Trim command support was released for Windows 7. Trim support gives the SSD the ability to take the memory that is marked to be deleted to erased immediately. This gives the drive more space to reuse, and reduces performance loss over time. The firmware also increased overall sequential write times of the 160 GB X25-M G2, though not of the 80 GB version. This increased the maximum write speed of 70 MB/s to 100 MB/s. Intel refused to release any trim-supporting firmware for the first generation X25-M. According to discussions tech journalist Anand Lal Shimpi with Intel \\"this isn‚Äôt a technical limitation of the drives, but rather something Intel is choosing to enable only on the 34nm products\\" to pressure users to upgrade.Intel's 34nm SSD Preview: Cheaper and Faster?, Anand Lal Shimpi, Anandtech, July 21, 2009 =Bugs= Two bugs with the firmware on the X25-M G2 were fixed. The first bug had complications with a BIOS HDD password. A BIOS HDD password is used to reduce functionality of the computer unless the user inputs the correct password. The problem was that certain X25-M G2 drives that shipped with the bugged (02G2) firmware gave difficulty to any users that used a BIOS HDD password. This means that users who bought the drive with this firmware had to do the following until the next firmware update: should not set a BIOS HDD password, change or disable the BIOS password.Malventano, Allyn. \\"PC Perspective - Intel X25-M 'G2' 34nm 160GB SSD Review.\\" - PC Perspective .22 July 2009.

Mike Hamsterbacke (eng. \\"Hamstercheek\\") lives here together with his father Alfred in a small house. His best friends are Birne, a living light bulb from China and the academic Dr. Karl H√∂hn, a mixture between a mouse and a bird. Since issue 02/1989 Mike also has a girlfriend called Tina, whom he met in a sausage factory owned by Gottlieb Grunz, where she was working as the company nurse. Since issue 05/1982, Mike has had an enemy called Girerschlund Wolf, a notorious villain and thief, who has dedicated his entire life to Mike's downfall. However, his own incompetence and overconfidence always foil his plans. A typical Mike story often begins my Mike's father looking for an assistant job in the town newspaper (\\"S√ºlzberger Bote\\") for his son, so that he can \\"improve his allowance\\". Mike starts on this job with such euphoria so that in the end, something goes horribly wrong and Mike is fired from his new job. Since issue 11/1986, the concept was changed, with many Mike stories being adventures, where Mike travels throughout the world with Dr. Karl H√∂hn. Since issue 04/1997, around half of the contents consist of reprints of older stories (from 1986 onwards). The comic was cancelled in issue 03/2007. Mike and the secret of the dwarf forest The longest story ever to be published is the multi-part story Mike und das Geheimnis des Zwergenwaldes (\\"Mike and the secret of the dwarf forest\\"). It was published from issue 05/1979 to issue 03/1982 and consisted of 18 episodes over 130 pages. The story consists of a camping trip that Mike, Dr. Karl H√∂hn and Birne go on together, into the idyllic dwarf forest. When they arrive at the camping site, Karl goes to fetch firewood, falls down into a hole and is rescued by friendly Waldl√§ufer Wurzelwarz. Mike and Birne go to search for Dr. H√∂hn and also fall down the same hole. Thus begins a genuine fantasy epic with dwarfs, dragons, elves, a fabulous golden key and an evil sorcerer called Feuerbart and his demonic troops.

Vadim Lyubashevsky. Lattice-Based Identification Schemes Secure Under Active Attacks. In Proceedings of the Practice and theory in public key cryptography , 11th international conference on Public key cryptography, 2008. Ideal lattices naturally occur in many parts of number theory, but also in other areas. In particular, they have a significant place in cryptography. Micciancio defined a generalization of cyclic lattices as ideal lattices. They can be used in cryptosystems to decrease by a square root the number of parameters necessary to describe a lattice, making them more efficient. Ideal lattices are a new concept, but similar lattice classes have been used for a long time. For example cyclic lattices, a special case of ideal lattices, are used in NTRUEncrypt and NTRUSign. Ideal lattices also form the basis for quantum computer attack resistant cryptography based on the Ring Learning with Errors. These cryptosystems are provably secure under the assumption that the shortest vector problem (SVP) is hard in these ideal lattices. Introduction In general terms, ideal lattices are lattices corresponding to ideals in rings of the form \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle for some irreducible polynomial f of degree n . All of the definitions of ideal lattices from prior work are instances of the following general notion: let R be a ring whose additive group is isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Z}^n (i.e., it is a free \\\\mathbb{Z} -module of rank n ), and let \\\\sigma be an additive isomorphism mapping R to some lattice \\\\sigma(R) in an n-dimensional real vector space (e.g., \\\\mathbb{R}^n ). The family of ideal lattices for the ring R under the embedding \\\\sigma is the set of all lattices \\\\sigma(I) , where I is an ideal in R. Vadim Lyubashevsky, Chris Peikert and Oded Regev. On Ideal Lattices and Learning with Errors over Rings. In Eurocrypt 2010, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2010. Definition =Notation= Let f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}[x] be a monic polynomial of degree n , and consider the quotient ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle . Using the standard set of representatives \\\\lbrace(g \\\\bmod f) : g \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}[x] \\\\rbrace , and identification of polynomials with vectors, the quotient ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle is isomorphic (as an additive group) to the integer lattice \\\\mathbb{Z}^n, and any ideal I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle defines a corresponding integer sublattice \\\\mathcal{L}(I)\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}^n. An ideal lattice is an integer lattice \\\\mathcal{L}(B)\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}^n such that B = \\\\lbrace g \\\\bmod f : g \\\\in I \\\\rbrace for some monic polynomial f of degree n and ideal I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle . =Related properties= It turns out that the relevant properties of f for the resulting function to be collision resistant are: * f should be irreducible. * the ring norm \\\\lVert g \\\\rVert_f is not much bigger than \\\\lVert g \\\\rVert_\\\\infty for any polynomial g, in a quantitative sense. The first property implies that every ideal of the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle defines a full-rank lattice in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n and plays a fundamental role in proofs. Lemma: Every ideal I of \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle , where f is a monic, irreducible integer polynomial of degree n , is isomorphic to a full-rank lattice in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n . Ding and LindnerJintai Ding and Richard Lindner. Identifying Ideal Lattices. In Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2007/322, 2007. gave evidence that distinguishing ideal lattices from general ones can be done in polynomial time and showed that in practice randomly chosen lattices are never ideal. They only considered the case where the lattice has full rank, i.e. the basis consists of n linear independent vectors. This is not a fundamental restriction because Lyubashevsky and Micciancio have shown that if a lattice is ideal with respect to an irreducible monic polynomial, then it has full rank, as given in the above lemma. Algorithm: Identifying ideal lattices with full rank bases Data: A full-rank basis B \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^{(n,n)} Result: true and \\\\textbf{q} , if B spans an ideal lattice with respect to \\\\textbf{q} , otherwise false. # Transform B into HNF # Calculate A = {\\\\rm adj}(B) , d = \\\\det(B) , and z = B_{(n,n)} # Calculate the product P = AMB \\\\bmod d # if only the last column of P is non-zero then # set c = P_{(\\\\centerdot,n)} to equal this column # else return false # if z \\\\mid c_i for i = 1, \\\\ldots , n then # use CRT to find q^\\\\ast \\\\equiv (c/z) \\\\bmod (d/z) and q^ \\\\ast \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod \\\\ z # else return false # if Bq^ \\\\ast \\\\equiv 0 \\\\bmod (d/z) then # return true, q = Bq^ \\\\ast /d # else return false where the matrix M is : M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_{n-1} & & & & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & & & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} Using this algorithm, it can be seen that many lattices are not ideal lattices. For example let n = 2 and k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\smallsetminus \\\\lbrace 0, \\\\pm 1 \\\\rbrace , then : B_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} k & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} is ideal, but : B_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & k \\\\end{pmatrix} is not. B_2 with k = 2 is an example given by Lyubashevsky and Micciancio.Lyubashevsky, V., Micciancio, D. Generalized compact knapsacks are collision resistant.. In CBugliesi, M., Preneel, B., Sassone, V., Wegener, I. (eds.) ICALP 2006. LNCS, vol. 4052, pp. 144‚Äì155. Springer, Heidelberg (2006). Performing the algorithm on it and referring to the basis as B, matrix B is already in Hermite Normal Form so the first step is not needed. The determinant is d = 2 , the adjugate matrix : A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, : M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} and finally, the product P = AMB \\\\bmod d is : P = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. At this point the algorithm stops, because all but the last column of P have to be zero if B would span an ideal lattice. Use in cryptography MicciancioMicciancio, D. Generalized compact knapsacks, cyclic lattices, and efficient oneway functions.. In Computational Complexity 16(4), 365‚Äì411 (2007). introduced the class of structured cyclic lattices, which correspond to ideals in polynomial rings \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^n-1), and presented the first provably secure one-way function based on the worst-case hardness of the restriction of Poly(n)-SVP to cyclic lattices. (The problem Œ≥-SVP consists in computing a non-zero vector of a given lattice, whose norm is no more than Œ≥ times larger than the norm of a shortest non-zero lattice vector.) At the same time, thanks to its algebraic structure, this one-way function enjoys high efficiency comparable to the NTRU scheme \\\\tilde{O}(n) evaluation time and storage cost). Subsequently, Lyubashevsky and Micciancio and independently Peikert and RosenPeikert, C., Rosen, A. Efficient collision-resistant hashing from worst-case assumptions on cyclic lattices. . In Halevi, S., Rabin, T. (eds.) TCC 2006. LNCS, vol. 3876, pp. 145‚Äì166. Springer, Heidelberg (2006). showed how to modify Micciancio‚Äôs function to construct an efficient and provably secure collision resistant hash function. For this, they introduced the more general class of ideal lattices, which correspond to ideals in polynomial rings \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/f(x). The collision resistance relies on the hardness of the restriction of Poly(n)-SVP to ideal lattices (called Poly(n)-Ideal-SVP). The average-case collision-finding problem is a natural computational problem called Ideal-SIS, which has been shown to be as hard as the worst-case instances of Ideal-SVP. Provably secure efficient signature schemes from ideal lattices have also been proposed,Vadim Lyubashevsky and Daniele Micciancio. Asymptotically efficient lattice-based digital signatures. In Proceedings of the 5th conference on Theory of cryptography, 2008. but constructing efficient provably secure public key encryption from ideal lattices was an interesting open problem. The fundamental idea of using LWE and Ring LWE for key exchange was proposed and filed at the University of Cincinnati in 2011 by Jintai Ding and provided a state of the art description of a quantum resistant key exchange using Ring LWE. The paper appeared in 2012 after a provisional patent application was filed in 2012. In 2014, Peikert presented a key transport scheme following the same basic idea of Ding's, where the new idea of sending additional signal for rounding in Ding's construction is also utilized. A digital signature using the same concepts was done several years earlier by Vadim Lyubashevsky in, \\"Lattice Signatures Without Trapdoors.\\" Together, the work of Peikert and Lyubashevsky provide a suite of Ring-LWE based quantum attack resistant algorithms with the same security reductions. =Efficient collision resistant hash functions= The main usefulness of the ideal lattices in cryptography stems from the fact that very efficient and practical collision resistant hash functions can be built based on the hardness of finding an approximate shortest vector in such lattices. Independently constructed collision resistant hash functions by Peikert and Rosen, as well as Lyubashevsky and Micciancio, based on ideal lattices (a generalization of cyclic lattices), and provided a fast and practical implementation. These results paved the way for other efficient cryptographic constructions including identification schemes and signatures. Lyubashevsky and Micciancio gave constructions of efficient collision resistant hash functions that can be proven secure based on worst case hardness of the shortest vector problem for ideal lattices. They defined hash function families as: Given a ring R = \\\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle , where f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_p[x] is a monic, irreducible polynomial of degree n and p is an integer of order roughly n^2 , generate m random elements a_1, \\\\dots , a_m \\\\in R , where m is a constant. The ordered m -tuple h = (a_1, \\\\ldots, a_m) \\\\in R^m determines the hash function. It will map elements in D^m , where D is a strategically chosen subset of R , to R . For an element b = (b_1, \\\\ldots , b_m) \\\\in D^m , the hash is h(b) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\\\alpha_i \\\\centerdot b_i. Here the size of the key (the hash function) is O(mn \\\\log p) = O(n \\\\log n), and the operation \\\\alpha_i \\\\centerdot b_i can be done in time O(n \\\\log n \\\\log \\\\log n) by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) , for appropriate choice of the polynomial f . Since m is a constant, hashing requires time O(n \\\\log n \\\\log \\\\log n). They proved that the hash function family is collision resistant by showing that if there is a polynomial-time algorithm that succeeds with non-negligible probability in finding b eq b' \\\\in D^m such that h(b) = h(b') , for a randomly chosen hash function h \\\\in R^m , then a certain problem called the ‚Äúshortest vector problem‚Äù is solvable in polynomial time for every ideal of the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle . Based on the work of Lyubashevsky and Micciancio in 2006, Micciancio and RegevDaniele Micciancio, Oded Regev Lattice-based Cryptography . In POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY, 2009. defined the following algorithm of hash functions based on ideal lattices: * Parameters: Integers q, n, m, d with n \\\\mid m , and vector f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n . * Key: m/n vectors a_1, \\\\ldots , a_{m/n} chosen independently and uniformly at random in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n . * Hash function: f_A : \\\\lbrace 0, \\\\ldots , d-1 \\\\rbrace ^m \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n given by f_A(y)= [F \\\\ast a_1  \\\\ldots  F \\\\ast a_{m/n}]y \\\\bmod \\\\ q . Here n,m,q,d are parameters, f is a vector in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n and A is a block-matrix with structured blocks A^{(i)} = F \\\\ast a^{(i)}. Finding short vectors in \\\\Lambda_q^\\\\perp ([F \\\\ast a_1  \\\\ldots  F \\\\ast a_{m/n}]) on the average (even with just inverse polynomial probability) is as hard as solving various lattice problems (such as approximate SVP and SIVP) in the worst case over ideal lattices, provided the vector f satisfies the following two properties: * For any two unit vectors u, v, the vector [F‚àóu]v has small (say, polynomial in n , typically O(\\\\sqrt{n})) norm. * The polynomial f(x) = x^n+f_n x^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+f_1 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}[x] is irreducible over the integers, i.e., it does not factor into the product of integer polynomials of smaller degree. The first property is satisfied by the vector \\\\mathbf{F} = (-1,0, \\\\ldots ,0) corresponding to circulant matrices, because all the coordinates of [F‚àóu]v are bounded by 1, and hence \\\\lVert [\\\\textbf{F} \\\\ast \\\\textbf{u}]\\\\textbf{v} \\\\rVert \\\\leq{\\\\sqrt{n}} . However, the polynomial x^n-1 corresponding to \\\\mathbf{f} = (-1,0, \\\\ldots ,0) is not irreducible because it factors into (x-1)(x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}+\\\\cdots+ x + 1), and this is why collisions can be efficiently found. So, \\\\mathbf{f} = (-1,0, \\\\ldots ,0) is not a good choice to get collision resistant hash functions, but many other choices are possible. For example, some choices of f for which both properties are satisfied (and therefore, result in collision resistant hash functions with worst-case security guarantees) are * \\\\mathbf{f} = (1, \\\\ldots ,1) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n where n + 1 is prime, and * \\\\mathbf{f} = (1,0, \\\\ldots ,0) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n for n equal to a power of 2. =Digital signatures= Digital signatures schemes are among the most important cryptographic primitives. They can be obtained by using the one-way functions based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems. However, they are impractical. A number of new digital signature schemes based on learning with errors, ring learning with errors and trapdoor lattices have been developed since the learning with errors problem was applied in a cryptographic context. Their direct construction of digital signatures based on the complexity of approximating the shortest vector in ideal (e.g., cyclic) lattices. The scheme of Lyubashevsky and Micciancio has worst-case security guarantees based on ideal lattices and it is the most asymptotically efficient construction known to date, yielding signature generation and verification algorithms that run in almost linear time. One of the main open problems that was raised by their work is constructing a one-time signature with similar efficiency, but based on a weaker hardness assumption. For instance, it would be great to provide a one-time signature with security based on the hardness of approximating the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) (in ideal lattices) to within a factor of \\\\tilde{O}(n) . Their construction is based on a standard transformation from one-time signatures (i.e. signatures that allow to securely sign a single message) to general signature schemes, together with a novel construction of a lattice based one-time signature whose security is ultimately based on the worst-case hardness of approximating the shortest vector in all lattices corresponding to ideals in the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle for any irreducible polynomial f . Key- Generation Algorithm: Input: 1^n, irreducible polynomial f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} of degree n. # Set p \\\\longleftarrow (\\\\varphi n)^3 , m \\\\longleftarrow \\\\lceil \\\\log n \\\\rceil , R \\\\longleftarrow \\\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]/\\\\langle f \\\\rangle # For all positive i , let the sets DK_i and DL_i be defined as: : DK_i = \\\\lbrace \\\\hat{y} \\\\in R^m such that \\\\lVert \\\\hat{y} \\\\rVert_\\\\infty \\\\leq 5ip^{1/m} \\\\rbrace : DL_i = \\\\lbrace \\\\hat{y} \\\\in R^m such that \\\\lVert \\\\hat{y} \\\\rVert_\\\\infty \\\\leq 5in \\\\varphi p^{1/m} \\\\rbrace # Choose uniformly random h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_{R,m} # Pick a uniformly random string r \\\\in \\\\lbrace 0, 1 \\\\rbrace^{\\\\lfloor \\\\log^2n \\\\rfloor} # If r = 0^{\\\\lfloor \\\\log^2n \\\\rfloor} then # Set j = \\\\lfloor \\\\log^2n \\\\rfloor # else # Set j to the position of the first 1 in the string r # end if # Pick \\\\hat{k} , \\\\hat{l} independently and uniformly at random from DK_j and DL_j respectively # Signing Key: (\\\\hat{k} , \\\\hat{l}). Verification Key: (h,h(\\\\hat{k}) , h(\\\\hat{l})) Signing Algorithm: Input: Message z \\\\in R such that \\\\lVert z \\\\rVert_\\\\infty \\\\leq 1 ; signing key (\\\\hat{k} , \\\\hat{l}) Output: \\\\hat{s} \\\\longleftarrow \\\\hat{k}z + \\\\hat{l} Verification Algorithm: Input: Message z ; signature \\\\hat{s} ; verification key (h,h(\\\\hat{k}) , h(\\\\hat{l})) Output: ‚ÄúACCEPT‚Äù, if \\\\lVert \\\\hat{s} \\\\rVert_\\\\infty \\\\leq 10 \\\\varphi p^{1/m}n \\\\log^2n and \\\\hat{s} = \\\\hat{k}z + \\\\hat{l} ‚ÄúREJECT‚Äù, otherwise. =The SWIFFT hash function= The hash function is quite efficient and can be computed asymptotically in \\\\tilde{O}(m) time using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) over the complex numbers. However, in practice, this carries a substantial overhead. The SWIFFT family of hash functions defined by Micciancio and Regev is essentially a highly optimized variant of the hash function above using the (FFT) in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q. The vector f is set to (1, 0,\\\\dots , 0) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n for n equal to a power of 2, so that the corresponding polynomial x^n + 1 is irreducible. Let q be a prime number such that 2n divides q-1 , and let \\\\textbf{W} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^{n \\\\times n}_{q} be an invertible matrix over \\\\mathbb{Z}_q to be chosen later. The SWIFFT hash function maps a key \\\\tilde{a}^{(1)} , \\\\ldots , \\\\tilde{a}^{(m/n)} consisting of m/n vectors chosen uniformly from \\\\mathbb{Z}^{n}_{q} and an input y \\\\in \\\\lbrace 0, \\\\ldots , d-1 \\\\rbrace^m to \\\\textbf{W}^{\\\\centerdot} f_A(y) \\\\bmod \\\\ q where \\\\textbf{A} = [ \\\\textbf{F} \\\\ast \\\\alpha^{(1)}, \\\\ldots, \\\\textbf{F} \\\\ast \\\\alpha^{(m/n)} ] is as before and \\\\alpha^{(i)} = \\\\textbf{W}^{-1} \\\\tilde{a}^{(i)} \\\\bmod q . Multiplication by the invertible matrix \\\\textbf{W}^{-1} maps a uniformly chosen \\\\tilde{a} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^n_q to a uniformly chosen \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^{n}_q . Moreover, \\\\textbf{W}^{\\\\centerdot} f_A(y)=\\\\textbf{W}^{\\\\centerdot} f_A(y') \\\\pmod q if and only if f_A(y)= f_A(y') \\\\pmod q . Together, these two facts establish that finding collisions in SWIFFT is equivalent to finding collisions in the underlying ideal lattice function f_A , and the claimed collision resistance property of SWIFFT is supported by the connection to worst case lattice problems on ideal lattices. The algorithm of the SWIFFT hash function is: * Parameters: Integers n, m, q, d such that n is a power of 2, q is prime, 2n \\\\mid (q-1) and n \\\\mid m . * Key: m/n vectors \\\\tilde{a}_1, \\\\ldots , \\\\tilde{a}_{m/n} chosen independently and uniformly at random in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n . * Input: m/n vectors y^{(1)}, \\\\dots , y^{(m/n)} \\\\in \\\\lbrace 0, \\\\dots , d-1 \\\\rbrace ^n . * Output: the vector \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m/n} \\\\tilde{a}^{(i)} \\\\odot (\\\\textbf{W}y^{(i)}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_q^n , where \\\\odot is the component-wise vector product. =Learning with errors (LWE)= Ring-LWE Learning with errors (LWE) problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems and has served as the foundation for many cryptographic applications. However, these applications are inefficient because of an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. To get truly efficient LWE applications, Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev defined an appropriate version of the LWE problem in a wide class of rings and proved its hardness under worst-case assumptions on ideal lattices in these rings. They called their LWE version ring-LWE. Let f(x)= x^n+1 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}[x] , where the security parameter n is a power of 2, making f(x) irreducible over the rationals. (This particular f(x) comes from the family of cyclotomic polynomials, which play a special role in this work). Let R= \\\\mathbb{Z}[x]/\\\\langle f(x) \\\\rangle be the ring of integer polynomials modulo f(x) . Elements of R (i.e., residues modulo f(x) ) are typically represented by integer polynomials of degree less than n . Let q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\bmod 2n be a sufficiently large public prime modulus (bounded by a polynomial in n ), and let R_q = R/\\\\langle q \\\\rangle = \\\\mathbb{Z}_q[x]/\\\\langle f(x) \\\\rangle be the ring of integer polynomials modulo both f(x) and q . Elements of R_q may be represented by polynomials of degree less than n -whose coefficients are from \\\\lbrace 0 , \\\\dots , q-1 \\\\rbrace . In the above-described ring, the R-LWE problem may be described as follows. Let s = s(x) \\\\in R_q be a uniformly random ring element, which is kept secret. Analogously to standard LWE, the goal of the attacker is to distinguish arbitrarily many (independent) ‚Äòrandom noisy ring equations‚Äô from truly uniform ones. More specifically, the noisy equations are of the form (a, b \\\\approx a \\\\centerdot s) \\\\in R_q \\\\times R_q , where a is uniformly random and the product a \\\\centerdot s is perturbed by some ‚Äòsmall‚Äô random error term, chosen from a certain distribution over R . They gave a quantum reduction from approximate SVP (in the worst case) on ideal lattices in R to the search version of ring-LWE, where the goal is to recover the secret s \\\\in R_q (with high probability, for any s ) from arbitrarily many noisy products. This result follows the general outline of Regev‚Äôs iterative quantum reduction for general lattices,Oded Regev. On lattices, learning with errors, random linear codes, and cryptography . In Journal of the ACM, 2009. but ideal lattices introduce several new technical roadblocks in both the ‚Äòalgebraic‚Äô and ‚Äògeometric‚Äô components of the reduction. They used algebraic number theory, in particular, the canonical embedding of a number field and the Chinese Remainder Theorem to overcome these obstacles. They got the following theorem: Theorem Let K be an arbitrary number field of degree n . Let \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha (n) \\\\in (0, 1) be arbitrary, and let the (rational) integer modulus q = q(n) \\\\geq 2 be such that \\\\alpha \\\\centerdot q \\\\geq \\\\omega (\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}) . There is a probabilistic polynomial-time quantum reduction from K - DGS_\\\\gamma to \\\\mathcal{O}_K \\\\- LWE_{q, \\\\Psi \\\\leq \\\\alpha} , where \\\\gamma = \\\\eta_\\\\epsilon(I) \\\\centerdot \\\\omega(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n})/\\\\alpha . In 2013, Guneysu, Lyubashevsky, and Poppleman proposed a digital signature scheme based on the Ring Learning with Errors problem. In 2014, Peikert presented a Ring Learning with Errors Key Exchange (RLWE-KEX) in his paper, \\"Lattice Cryptography for the Internet.\\" This was further developed by the work of Singh. Ideal-LWE Stehle, Steinfeld, Tanaka and Xagawa Damien Stehl√©, Ron Steinfeld, Keisuke Tanaka and Keita Xagawa. Efficient public key encryption based on ideal lattices. In Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2009. defined a structured variant of LWE problem (Ideal-LWE) to describe an efficient public key encryption scheme based on the worst case hardness of the approximate SVP in ideal lattices. This is the first CPA- secure public key encryption scheme whose security relies on the hardness of the worst-case instances of \\\\tilde{O}(n^2) -Ideal-SVP against subexponential quantum attacks. It achieves asymptotically optimal efficiency: the public/private key length is \\\\tilde{O}(n) bits and the amortized encryption/decryption cost is \\\\tilde{O}(1) bit operations per message bit (encrypting \\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}(n) bits at once, at a \\\\tilde{O}(n) cost). The security assumption here is that \\\\tilde{O}(n^2) -Ideal-SVP cannot be solved by any subexponential time quantum algorithm. It is noteworthy that this is stronger than standard public key cryptography security assumptions. On the other hand, contrary to the most of public key cryptography, lattice-based cryptography allows security against subexponential quantum attacks. Most of the cryptosystems based on general lattices rely on the average-case hardness of the Learning with errors (LWE). Their scheme is based on a structured variant of LWE, that they call Ideal-LWE. They needed to introduce some techniques to circumvent two main difficulties that arise from the restriction to ideal lattices. Firstly, the previous cryptosystems based on unstructured lattices all make use of Regev‚Äôs worst-case to average-case classical reduction from Bounded Distance Decoding problem (BDD) to LWE (this is the classical step in the quantum reduction from SVP to LWE). This reduction exploits the unstructured-ness of the considered lattices, and does not seem to carry over to the structured lattices involved in Ideal-LWE. In particular, the probabilistic independence of the rows of the LWE matrices allows to consider a single row. Secondly, the other ingredient used in previous cryptosystems, namely Regev‚Äôs reduction from the computational variant of LWE to its decisional variant, also seems to fail for Ideal-LWE: it relies on the probabilistic independence of the columns of the LWE matrices. To overcome these difficulties, they avoided the classical step of the reduction. Instead, they used the quantum step to construct a new quantum average-case reduction from SIS (average-case collision-finding problem) to LWE. It also works from Ideal-SIS to Ideal-LWE. Combined with the reduction from worst-case Ideal-SVP to average-case Ideal-SIS, they obtained the a quantum reduction from Ideal- SVP to Ideal-LWE. This shows the hardness of the computational variant of Ideal-LWE. Because they did not obtain the hardness of the decisional variant, they used a generic hardcore function to derive pseudorandom bits for encryption. This is why they needed to assume the exponential hardness of SVP. =Fully homomorphic encryption= A fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is one which allows for computation over encrypted data, without first needing to decrypt. The problem of constructing a fully homomorphic encryption scheme was first put forward by Rivest, Adleman and DertouzosR. Rivest, L. Adleman, and M. Dertouzos. [On data banks and privacy homomorphisms.]. In In Foundations of Secure Computation, pp. 169‚Äì180, 1978. in 1978, shortly after the invention of RSA by Rivest, Adleman and Shamir.R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman. [A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems.]. In Comm. of the ACM,21:2, pages 120‚Äì126, 1978. An encryption scheme \\\\varepsilon = (\\\\mathsf{KeyGen}, \\\\mathsf{Encrypt}, \\\\mathsf{Decrypt}, \\\\mathsf{Eval}) is homomorphic for circuits in \\\\mathcal{C} if, for any circuit C \\\\in \\\\mathcal{C}, given PK, SK \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathsf{KeyGen}(1^\\\\lambda), y = \\\\mathsf{Encrypt}(PK, x), and y' = \\\\mathsf{Eval}(PK, C, y), it holds that \\\\mathsf{Decrypt}(SK, y') = C(x). \\\\varepsilon is fully homomorphic if it is homomorphic for all circuits of size \\\\operatorname{poly}(\\\\lambda) where \\\\lambda is the scheme's security parameter. In 2009, GentryCraig Gentry. Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices. In the 41st ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), 2009. proposed the first solution to the problem of constructing a fully homomorphic encryption scheme. His scheme was based on ideal lattices.

She was one of the most popular authors in the short-lived gang pulp genre.Gang Pulp, Off-Trail Publications, 2008. . Even in an era of hardboiled crime fiction, her stories were unusually hard-edged and bitter. Her best work includes ingenious plotting, remorselessly violent characters, and colorful underworld argot. Most of her early stories appeared in the Harold Hersey- published pulp magazines Gangster Stories, Mobs, Prison Stories,Locke, John; editor. City of Numbered Men: The Best of Prison Stories, Off-Trail Publications, 2010. . Includes Harris' \\"Big House Boomerang,\\" set in San Quentin's jute mills. Racketeer Stories, and Gangland Stories. When Hersey sold off his assets, Harris continued to appear in the successor to Gangster Stories, Greater Gangster Stories. After the collapse of the gang pulps in 1934, Harris diversified into a variety of crime pulps, The Phantom Detective, Thrilling Detective, Super-Detective Stories, Popular Detective, etc. When the gang genre was temporarily revived in the late 1930s in the pulps, Double- Action Gang Magazine and Ten Story Gang, Harris was a frequent contributor. Her published output includes fewer than a hundred known stories, low for a pulp writer, but many of them were novelettes or short novels. Little is known of Harris' background. It is believed that \\"Margie Harris\\" is a pseudonym. The only biographical information comes from a jocular letter published in Gangster Stories. She claimed to have been a newspaper reporter; and many of her stories featured reporters and references to newspapers. From the cases she covered, she would have been in the Bay Area from approximately 1900-1915 and in Chicago from 1915-1930 (these ranges are very speculative). Criminals she knew in the Bay Area include Ed Morrell, the so-called Dungeon Man of San Quentin, and his neighbor in the solitary confinement cells, Jacob \\"Tiger Man\\" Oppenheimer.Sifakis, Carl. The Encyclopedia of American Prisons, Edward Morrell entry, Facts on File, Inc., 2003. In Chicago, she was acquainted with the big-time mobster Big Jim Colosimo.

Her new husband, David Macomb, was a member of a prominent local family, but his poor management of their property forced them into debt, and they settled in the southern United States, where Mary died while moving to Texas in 1836. Before moving southward, the Macombs resided in the present two-story house, which is built primarily of large blocks of sandstone. After the Macombs' departure, the property was converted for industrial uses. By 1845, multiple new buildings arose around the old structure, including a frame building and a slaughterhouse. These buildings are no longer on the property. In 1976, the Macomb House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically important architecture and because of its place in local history: most significant were its architecture, its role in commerce, and its place in the exploration and settlement of the local area., Ohio Historical Society, 2007.

This is opposed to a one-way contract that would pay the same salary regardless of where the athlete is assigned to play. Two-way contracts are common for professional ice hockey players who aspire to play in the National Hockey League (NHL). Any hockey player entering the NHL for the first time will sign an entry-level, two-way contract with an NHL team stipulating that he will receive a higher salary if assigned to play with the NHL team, but will receive a lower salary if assigned to play for a team in the minor leagues such as the American Hockey League or the ECHL. Beginning in the 2017‚Äì18 season, the National Basketball Association added two-way contracts between NBA teams and their NBA G League affiliates. Unlike in the NHL, these contracts are not offered to every aspiring NBA player, but only to undrafted players whom a team would like to keep \\"on retainer\\" without having to sign to a full-time contract. Each NBA team can have up to two two-way contract players per season, and are typically considered to be \\"16th and 17th men\\" on a roster. Excluding time spent before and after the G League's season begins and ends, players on two-way contracts can spend up to 45 days in the NBA while spending the rest of the season in the G League. As of the 2017‚Äì18 season, players earn $75,000 while they are in the G League and roughly $204,000 if they spend the maximum 45 days on an NBA roster. The two-way contract system benefits young undrafted players who do not want to play professional basketball overseas, as well as those who believe an organizational investment in them is beneficial to their development. Some player agents are concerned about this system, because in exchange for guaranteed employment at a higher salary than a typical G League player, two- way players give up the freedom to be called up from the G League by any NBA team, possibly one with intent to sign the player to a 10-day contract, which could eventually lead to a full-time NBA roster spot sooner than with a two- way contract. In baseball, players can receive a split contract. This contract pays the player different salaries based on whether they are in Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball.

Dalton was born in Hampshire, the eldest son of the Reverend Peter Dalton. His mother belonged to the prominent Dominick family of Dublin, who gave their name to Dominick Street in Dublin city centre. Sir Christopher Dominick (died 1743), who began laying out the street in the 1720s, was his uncle. He graduated from Queen's College, Oxford in 1702 and became a fellow of All Souls' College in 1706. He was called to the Bar in 1711. In 1725 he was appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and held that office until his death in 1730, aged about fifty-five.

The intent of the system is to generate human behaviors that comply with the self-correcting mechanisms of the Earth.http://www.earthscore.org/articles/intro_earthscore_overview.pdf Earthscore has been studied and utilized by university students and academics worldwide since 1992. Earthscore was developed and created by The New School professor and artist Paul Ryan, and originally published by NASA in 1990. Components In its most complete and succinct iteration, Earthscore is a notational system with five components. These components are: * Three Comprehensive Categories of Knowledge: The categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness * The Relational Circuit: A circuit that organizes the categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness in unambiguous, relative positions * Threeing: A formal, teachable version of cooperation * The Firstness of Thirdness: A spontaneous, intuitive appreciation of a pattern in nature * The Semiotic System for Interpretation: A process of generating signs to approach knowledge =Three Comprehensive Categories of Knowledge= The Three Peircean Categories Using the trikonic categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness developed by American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, Earthscore splits knowledge into three modes of being: firstness (positive quality), secondness (actual fact), and thirdness (laws that will govern facts in the future), and defines these categories as \\"a theory of everything\\". Firstness is positive quality in the realm of spontaneity, freshness, possibility, and freedom. Earthscore defines firstness as being \\"as is\\", without regard for any other. Examples include: the taste of banana, warmth, redness, and feeling gloomy. Secondness is a two-sided consciousness of effort and resistance engendered by being up against brute facts. Earthscore defines secondness as the \\"facticity\\", or \\"thisness\\", of something, as it exists, here and now, without rhyme or reason. Examples include: pushing against an unlocked door and meeting silent, unseen resistance. Thirdness mediates between secondness and firstness, between fact and possibility. Earthscore defines thirdness as the realm of habit and laws that will govern facts in the future, and posits that a knowledge of thirdness can allow predictions of how certain future events will turn out. It is an 'if...then' sort of knowledge. Thirdness consists in the reality that future facts of secondness will conform to general laws. =The Relational Circuit= The relational circuit is a self-penetrating, tubular continuum with six unambiguous positions which attempts to supply a topological continuum to the trikonic categories. The circuit organizes differences in terms of firstness, secondness, and thirdness, and three \\"in-between\\" positions that connect them within the continuum. The relational circuit is to the Earthscore System what the staff and bars are to classical music notation, and is the basis of the third component, threeing.http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/leonardo/v039/39.3ryan.pdfhttp://www.earthscore.org/articles/ed_creating_curriculum_two.pdf =Threeing= Threeing is a practice in which three people take turns playing three different roles; initiator, respondent and mediator, in an attempt to solve relational confusion. The roles correspond to the categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness. Through role playing, the three individuals interact with each other spontaneously and recursively, following the relational circuit. Threeing is further broken down into ten different subsections: * Profiling Skills and the Talking Stick * Diagnosing Relational Problems * Dividing the Tasks * Making Decisions * Reading Charles Peirce * Imitating Sherlock Holmes * Cultivating Creativity * Solving Problems * Planning to Three * Exploring the Yoga of Threeing =The Firstness of Thirdness= Earthscore utilizes the Firstness of Thirdness as a means of creativity, in an attempt to imagine an ecologically sustainable life before living it. By incorporating pure firstness as the realm of spontaneity, Earthscore uses the disciplines of Zen, yoga, and T'ai chi to cultivate the human capacity to be comfortable in pure firstness and yield new insights and visions. =The Semiotic System for Interpretation= Earthscore approaches knowledge as a process of generating signs, and incorporates the semiotic system of Charles Sanders Peirce consistent with the trikonic categories: A sign (firstness) representing an object (secondness) for an interpretant (thirdness). Earthscore exfoliates the threefold division into a sixty-six- fold classification of signs that is inclusive of everything in nature, in order to systematize both interdisciplinary and multimedia representations of ecosystems.

Early life and education The fifth son of Simon (an Anglican priest) and Ann (Ringgold) Wilmer, William Holland Wilmer was born on October 29, 1782 at the family's ancestral \\"Stepney Manor\\" in Kent County of Chestertown, Maryland. He graduated from Washington College there in Chestertown, Maryland in 1802 or 1803. Rev. William Smith had founded the college, but left twice, eventually becoming the first provost of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Wilmer's schoolmates likely included future Maryland Governor, Thomas Ward Veazey, future Maryland Episcopal bishop William Murray Stone and future Methodist bishop John Henry.William A. Clebsch, The Reverend Doctor William Holland Wilmer (1782-1827): His life work and thought (unpublished dissertation, Virginia Theological Seminary, Alexandria, 1951) pp. 8-9 After graduation, Wilmer went into business with his sister's husband, T. Cannell, for six years.Holmes p. 162 Career Although he had attended Methodist prayer meetings as a youth, Wilmer decided that his life's work was to preach the gospel through the established Episcopal Church. He accordingly studied privately, and in 1808 was ordained a deacon by Bishop Thomas Claggett. Wilmer's first assignment was his home parish in Chestertown, and during his four years there, he established what had been the Chapel of Ease in the town's center as the parish's main church, as the previous parish building five miles out of town went to ruin. In 1812, shortly after the death of his first wife as he himself reached the age of 30, and after ordination as a priest, Wilmer accepted the joint invitation of Bishop Claggett and William Meade (a newly ordained deacon and who later became the third Episcopal Bishop of Virginia), moved to Alexandria, Virginia and took charge of the recently organized St. Paul's Church.Walter C. Whitaker, Richard Hooker Wilmer: Second Bishop of Alabama (Philadelphia: George W. Jacobs 1907) pp. 5-7, available at https://archive.org/details/richardhookerwi00whitgoogClebsch p. 83 explains the Alexandria parishes were served by Bishop Claggett until Bishop Moore's consecration For a year, Wilmer also served as the first rector of St. John's Church, on Lafayette Square across from what was then called the President's House in the newly created and laid out national capital of District of Columbia, but resigned that position to concentrate on his ministry in Alexandria.W. A. R. Goodwin, History of the Theological Seminary in Virginia and its Historical Background, (New York, Du Bois Press, 1923) p. 78 After the First Great Awakening, the disestablishment of the Episcopal Church in Virginia after the Revolutionary War (particularly the loss of \\"vacant\\" church lands circa 1801), and the death of Bishop James Madison as another war with Britain began in 1812, the Episcopal Church was at such a low ebb in the Commonwealth that its priests had not convened since 1805 and Madison's preferred successor, John Bracken, rector of Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg, declined the offer.John E. Booty, Mission and Ministry: A history of Virginia Theological Seminary (Harrisburg, PA: Morehouse Publishing 1995) p. 4Clebsch pp. 41-44 Meade had crossed the Potomac River to study for ordination under Rev. Walter Addison (who succeeded this priest's uncle Rev. James Jones Wilmer and Rev. Obadiah Bruen Brown as Senate Chaplain), but weak eyes had forced him to pause his studies for a time.Booty, pp. 6, 44 By that date only about half of Virginia's Episcopal parishes had priests (most serving several churches), and the diocese of Maryland was little better off. St Paul's Church, Alexandria Virginia Wilmer (and the Second Great Awakening) revitalized the Episcopal Church in the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River region. Wilmer helped Virginia's second bishop Richard Channing Moore (whom he, Meade, Edmund Lee and Bushrod Washington convinced to accept the position headquartered at Monumental Church in Richmond) reinvigorate it more broadly. The Evangelical Anglicanism movement of William Wilberforce as well as the moderation of Calvinist doctrine advanced by Charles Simeon influenced all these clergymen.Booty, pp. 14-15 In 1814, Virginia's Episcopal priests and laity convened and formally elected Bishop Moore. During the diocesan convention, Wilmer delivered the first sermon at the newly rebuilt Monumental Church, followed the next Sunday by then Rev. Meade.B.B. Wilmer, \\"The Theology and Teaching of the Rev. Dr. William Holland Wilmer\\" in Goodwin, pp. 366-372 In June 1817, Wilmer's Alexandria congregation having outgrown its building, the cornerstone was laid for a new building, designed by Benjamin H. Latrobe of Baltimore and with an interior patterned after a Christopher Wren building (St. James Church, Piccadilly, London) and which would seat 600.Clebsch p. 11 Through that summer and winter, Wilmer and Richard Baxter (a leading Jesuit of Georgetown University published a total of 53 learned letters under pseudonyms in the 'Alexandria Gazette' debating Evangelical Lutheran doctrine, which were collected and published together in 1818.Clebsch pp. 14-16 Despite his own congregation's growth, Wilmer remained concerned about the continued shortage of educated Episcopalian priests. In June, 1818, a year after the national General Convention approved the creation of the General Theological Seminary in New York City, Wilmer became the first President of the Society for the Education of Pious Young Men for the Ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Maryland and Virginia, a position he held until leaving Alexandria for Williamsburg in 1826.Booty, p. 29 The previous year, Wilmer had been one of three men delegated to raise funds for the General Theological Seminary in New York, with particular responsibility for fundraising in the southern dioceses, and he served on the GTS board of trustees from 1820 until his death. Another Education Society founder was Reuel Keith (1792-1842), rector of the newly founded Christ Church (in the District of Columbia but part of the Diocese of Maryland), who had studied at Middlebury College and the recently founded Andover Theological Seminary (mostly Congregational) in Massachusetts before being ordained by Bishop Moore in 1817.Booty, pp. 9, 30 In 1819, Wilmer began publishing and editing the 'Washington Theological Repertory'.Booty pp. 16-17 and the following year received a doctor of divinity degree from Brown University.Clebsch, p. 21 considers it probably honorary The journal was designed to \\"disseminate the principles of religion and piety,\\" and Wilmer also became involved in several tract and prayer book societies.Clebsch pp. 71-76 In 1822 Wilmer published in Baltimore (with the imprimatur of the clerk of the Diocese of Maryland), The Episcopal Manual: A Summary Explanation of the Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America. The popular manual may have first been published as early as 1815, and was republished at least four times, including in 1829, shortly after the author's early death.Clebsch pp. 13, 84-88 Meanwhile, in 1821, the Virginia convention of the Episcopal church pledged its support for a regional seminary. Acquiescing to lobbying by the College of William and Mary since at least 1815,Goodwin, p. 76 the Virginia convention recommended the seminary be located in Williamsburg, to involve the Diocese of North Carolina, as well as those men from the District of Columbia and Diocese of Maryland who had been working together through the Education Society. However, the convention of the Diocese of Maryland failed to concur.Clebsch pp. 64-65 Meanwhile, Keith had moved from Georgetown to Williamsburg in 1820 to teach history and classics at the College of William and Mary, as well as to lead Bruton Parish Church‚Äîbut his classes seemed unpopular and he never had more than one theological student at a time. In 1823 he left for his native Vermont.Booty pp. 31-33.Goodwin p. 77 Moreover, enrollment had so declined at the College that its president, John Augustine Smith recommended it be moved to Richmond, which led to considerable controversy, Smith's resignation and move to New York. The committee appointed by the Virginia convention changed its mind about the proposed seminary's location‚Äîand accepted Alexandria after Hugh Nelson arranged significant funding and Wilmer offered space and persuaded Rev. Keith to return and become its first professor and dean. Thus, Wilmer and Meade (and Bishop Moore) helped found Virginia Theological Seminary(VTS), where Wilmer taught theology and church history from 1823-1826. The first class included thirteen candidates for holy orders, and three years later 23 men were studying at VTS.Booty pp. 34-38. Bruton Parish Church and churchyard Williamsburg Virginia by Frances Benjamin Johnston In 1826, after lobbying by Moore (but refusing his offered position in Richmond), Wilmer moved to Williamsburg to become professor of moral philosophy and rector of Bruton Parish Church.Clebsch pp. 77-78 He served as the historic College's interim president from June 1826 to October 1826, when he was elected its eleventh president. He served until his death the following July of \\"bilious fever\\"‚Äîa two-week illness after a long journey in driving rain.Clebsch pp. 29-31 His successor was Adam Empie. Wilmer also served five times as President of the House of Deputies at the General Convention (1817‚Äì26),Don S. Armentrout and Robert Boak Slocum, eds. An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, A User Friendly Reference for Episcopalians (New York: Church Publishing Incorporated, New York, NY 2000) p. 560. somewhat to the dismay of those with High Church predilections.E. Brooks Holifield, The Gentleman Theologians:American Theology and Southern Culture, 1795-1860, (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2007) pp. 161-162 Slavery During the first census in 1790, Simon Wilmer (either Wilmer's father or grandfather, for the name was used through several generations) owned 19 slaves and had five free male whites under age 16 in his Kent County, Maryland household.Clebsch p. 2 Although Wilmer's salaries were considered large for the time, according to his son's biographer, he spent considerable amounts buying and freeing slaves, so when he died unexpectedly at age 44, the family was forced to rely upon the parish's generosity, and his widow moved back to Alexandria and taught school for several years to support the young family.Whitaker, p. 17 As in the case of Robert Carter III, Virginians of this era often chose not to memorialize opposition to slavery. The Maryland Diocesan Archives (deposited with the Maryland Historical Society) only hold about 50 of Wilmer's letters and papers, although the first archivist, Ethan Allen, said his brief mission tour of Virginia's Northern Neck with Wilmer confirmed him in his faith and career.David L. Holmes, William Holland Wilmer: A Newly Discovered Memoir, Maryland Historical Magazine, Summer 1986, p. 160.Clebsch p. 60 Five of Wilmer's sermons were published before 1820; no copies remain of the 1818 or 1820 sermon entitled \\"The Almost Christian\\".Clebsch p. 84 Personal life and family Wilmer's first wife, Harriet Ringgold, also of an established family in Kent County, died soon after their marriage. Soon after moving to Alexandria, Wilmer married Marion Hannah Cox of Mount Holly, New Jersey, who died shortly after the birth of their sixth child in 1821 (and is buried at St. Paul's churchyard in Alexandria). Wilmer caused a scandal when he married Ann Brice Fitzhugh (1801-1854), two decades his junior, on February 5, 1823, but they had two children before his death, and she raised her stepchildren.Clebsch pp. 4-5 Although Wilmer's eldest son, William Porteus, died of yellow fever at age 21 in Natchez, Mississippi shortly after his father, both his brothers ultimately became priests, and two of his sisters also married clergymen (Marion Rebecca marrying Rev. R. Templeton Brown who ended his clerical career in Rockville, Maryland; and Jane Eliza Wilmer married Rev. Samuel Buel of the General Theological Seminary in New York). Richard Hooker Wilmer (aged 11 at his father's death) also worked to support the young family before beginning his clerical career. A firm believer in slavery, he was elected Bishop of Alabama and consecrated by bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America in 1862, and ratified by the General Convention after the war. Bishop Wilmer's son, another William Holland Wilmer (1863-1936) became a prominent ophthalmologist in Washington, D.C., Johns Hopkins University, and the Military Medical Research tLaboratory in Mineola, Long Island. and benefactor of Washington National Cathedral. Rev. Wilmer's other surviving son, George Thornton Wilmer (1819-1898), later like his father became rector of Bruton parish and a professor at the College of William and Mary, and after serving as a lieutenant in the Virginia Home Guard, a professor of theology at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, though he ultimately moved to and died in Pittsylvania County, Virginia.J.T. White, National Cyclopedia of American Biography (1893) p. 265 available at https://books.google.com/books?id=pN0DAAAAYAAJ&dq;=william+holland+wilmer+1827&source;=gbs_navlinks_s Rev. G.T. Wilmer's son Cary B. Wilmer also became a priest and taught at Sewanee.Clebsch, p. 4. Wilmer Hall at VTS Two of Wilmer's brothers also became Episcopal priests.Clebsch p. 3 Lemuel Wilmer became rector at Port Tobacco, Maryland (then a major slave trading port). His brother Simon held posts near the ancestral home in Kent County, Maryland as well as near Philadelphia (including Swedesborough, New Jersey and later Radnor, Pennsylvania) but was disciplined (silenced) by conservative (and new) bishop George Washington Doane for not giving up his affiliation with the Diocese of Pennsylvania (under Bishop William White) while serving as a supply priest for coastal New Jersey parishes without a rector since his departure from Swedesboro after his wife's death. Although this likewise evangelical or Methodist-leaning Rev. Simon Wilmer published a pamphlet in his defense, he ultimately married a rich widow and accepted a position near Washington, D.C. at Christ Episcopal Church in Accokeek, Prince George's County, Maryland.Ethan Allen, Clergy in Maryland of the Protestant Episcopal Church Since the Independence of 1783 (Baltimore, J.S.

Legacy Fifteen years after Wilmer's death, an updated edition of The Episcopal Manual (sometimes nicknamed Wilmer's Episcopal Manual) was published in Philadelphia.Goodwin at p. 374available at https://archive.org/details/MN5050ucmf_0 The College of William and Mary's Special Collections Research Center maintains his personal papers. Other records are held by the Diocese of Maryland. A tablet memorializing Wilmer remains posted in Bruton Church in Williamsburg.Goodwin, p. 82 VTS named its former library (and later reflectory) Wilmer Hall after this founder; a residence hall and campus street are now named after the founder. His former parish in Alexandria also built a hall named after their late rector in 1860; rebuilt in 1860, it housed a school (now parish offices and head start/preschool).

History =Aramaean temple of Hadad-Ramman= Damascus was the capital of the Aramaean state Aram-Damascus during the Iron Age. The Arameans of western Syria followed the cult of Hadad-Ramman, the god of thunderstorms and rain, and erected a temple dedicated to him at the site of the present-day Umayyad Mosque. It is not known exactly how the temple looked, but it is believed to have followed the traditional Semitic-Canaanite architectural form, resembling the Temple of Jerusalem. The site likely consisted of a walled courtyard, a small chamber for worship, and a tower-like structure typically symbolizing the \\"high place\\" of storm gods, in this case Hadad. One stone remains from the Aramaean temple, dated to the rule of King Hazael, is currently on display in the National Museum of Damascus.Burns, 2005, p.16. =Roman temple of Jupiter= The Temple of Hadad-Ramman continued to serve a central role in the city, and when the Romans conquered Damascus in 64 BCE they assimilated Hadad with their own god of thunder, Jupiter. Thus, they engaged in a project to reconfigure and expand the temple under the direction of Damascus-born architect Apollodorus, who created and executed the new design.Calcani and Abdulkarim, 2003, p.28. The symmetry and dimensions of the new Greco-Roman Temple of Jupiter impressed the local population. With the exception of the much increased scale of the building, most of its original Semitic design was preserved; the walled courtyard was largely left intact. In the center of the courtyard stood the cella, an image of the god which followers would honor.Burns, 2005, p.40. There was one tower at each of courtyard's four corners. The towers were used for rituals in line with ancient Semitic religious traditions where sacrifices were made on high places.Burns, 2005, pp.67-68. The sheer size of the compound suggests that the religious hierarchy of the temple, sponsored by the Romans, wielded major influence in the city's affairs.Burns, 2005, p.62. The Roman temple, which later became the center of the Imperial cult of Jupiter, was intended to serve as a response to the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. Instead of being dedicated to one god, the Roman temple combined (interpretatio graeca) all of the gods affiliated with heaven that were worshipped in the region such as Hadad, Ba'al-Shamin and Dushara, into the \\"supreme-heavenly-astral Zeus\\".Burns, 2005, p.65. The Temple of Jupiter would attain further additions during the early period of Roman rule of the city, mostly initiated by high priests who collected contributions from the wealthy citizens of Damascus. The inner court, or temenos is believed to have been completed soon after the end of Augustus' reign in 14CE. This was surrounded by an outer court, or peribolos which included a market, and was built in stages as funds permitted, and completed in the middle of the first century CE.Burns, 2005, p. 61. At this time the eastern gateway or propylaeum was first built. This main gateway was later expanded during the reign of Septimius Severus (r. 193‚Äì211 CE).Burns, 2005, p. 72. By the 4th century CE, the temple was especially renowned for its size and beauty. It was separated from the city by two sets of walls. The first, wider wall spanned a wide area that included a market, and the second wall surrounded the actual sanctuary of Jupiter. It was the largest temple in Roman Syria.Bowersock and Brown, 2001, pp.47-48. =Later history= During the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, Theodosius I converted the temple to a church dedicated to John the Baptist. After the Muslims took over Damascus in 635 CE, the church was shared for seventy years, but Al-Walid I converted it to the Umayyad Mosque. Archaeology and interpretation Richard Pococke published a plan of the temple compound in 1745 in his work A Description of the East and Some other Countries, Vol. II. In 1855 the Reverend Josias Porter published a plan showing 40 surviving columns or column fragments which still survived between houses in the area. In 1921 Wulzinger and Watzinger made a plan showing the peribolos to measure some 350m by 450m. See also * List of Ancient Roman temples References Bibliography * .

It is located north of Brunswick, Maine. It was closed in 1969. History Topsham AFS was initially the headquarters of the Air Defense Command Bangor Air Defense Sector (BaADS), which was activated on 8 January 1957. In 1958 a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-05) was established at Topsham AFS. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. A GATR site (R-25) was also constructed at Topsham as part of the 654th Radar Squadron at Brunswick AFS, but was reassigned to the BaADS at Topsham AFS when the 654th RADS was inactivated in 1965. The BaADS was absorbed by the 36th Air Division, being moved to Topsham from Davis Monthan AFB, Arizona on 1 April 1966. DC-02 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained under the 34th AD until it, and the Air Division was inactivated on 30 September 1969 when technology advances allowed the Air Force to shut down many SAGE Data Centers. With the inactivation of the 36th AD, the station and GATR site were closed. The former Topsham AFS is now an annex of the now-closed Naval Air Station Brunswick. The SAGE DC blockhouse was demolished in August 1985 and is now a recreation field. =Known ADCOM units assigned= * 36th Air Division, 1 April 1966 ‚Äì 30 September 1969 * Bangor Air Defense Sector, 8 January 1957 ‚Äì 1 April 1966 See also * List of USAF Aerospace Defense Command General Surveillance Radar Stations References * A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946 - 1980, by Lloyd H.

Typically, it resolves spontaneously by itself.Breast disorders in the pediatric and adolescent patient. Templeman C, Hertweck SP. Obstet Gynecol Clin North Am. 2000;27(1):19‚Äì34. Montgomery glands around the nipple. Symptoms A cyst of Montgomery may be asymptomatic. Yet, a cyst of Montgomery usually is diagnosed when a female patient, 10‚Äì20 years of age, complains to a healthcare professional of breast pain (mastalgia), inflammation or a palpable nodule in the breast. The diagnosis is made clinically, when a palpable nodule is felt in the retroareolar area.Disorders of the breast in children and adolescents, Part 2: breast masses. De Silva NK, Brandt ML. J Pediatr Adolesc Gynecol. 2006 Dec;19(6):415-8. Pathophysiology The periareolar glands of Montgomery in the breast are also called Montgomery tubercles or Morgagni tubercles. These periareolar glands are small, papular tissue projections at the edge of the areola (nipple).Obstruction of the Montgomery tubercles may result in an acute inflammation, a clear or light brownish fluid may drain out of the areola (nipple discharge), and an subareolar mass may develop, the cyst of Montgomery.Nipple discharge and breast lump related to Montgomery's tubercles in adolescent females. Watkins F, Giacomantonio M, Salisbury S. J Pediatr Surg. 1988;23(8):718-20. Diagnosis The diagnosis can be confirmed with ultrasonography, frequently showing a simple cyst in the retroareolar area. In some patients, multiple cysts or bilateral cysts may exist. Cysts of Montgomery may have liquid content with an echogenic or calcific sediment. Breast US in children and adolescents. Garc√≠a CJ, Espinoza A, Dinamarca V, Navarro O, Daneman A, Garc√≠a H, Cattani A. Radiographics. 2000 Nov‚ÄìDec;20(6):1605‚Äì12. Treatment and prognosis The clinical management of a cyst of Montgomery depends upon the symptoms of the patient. If there are no signs of infection, a cyst of Montgomery can be observed, because more than 80% resolve spontaneously, over only a few months. However, in some cases, spontaneous resolution may take up two years. In such cases, a repeat ultrasonography may become necessary. If, however, the patient has signs of an infection, for example reddening (erythema), warmth, pain and tenderness, a treatment for mastitis can be initiated, which may include antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). With treatment, inflammatory changes usually disappear quickly. In rare cases, drainage may become necessary. A surgical treatment of a cyst of Montgomery, i.e. a resection, may become necessary only if a cyst of Montgomery persists, or the diagnosis is questioned clinically.Overview of breast masses in children and adolescents. Banikarim C, De Silva NK. In: UpToDate [Textbook of Medicine]. Basow D (Ed). Massachusetts Medical Society, and Wolters Kluwer publishers. 2010. The prognosis seems to be excellent.

It contains the Grade II listed St. Ismael's Parish Church which has existed since at least 1230, and was extensively rebuilt in 1870-73 and restored in the 1990s. History Historically, Uzmaston and the surrounding parish belonged to the Hundred of Dungleddy. In 1993, five Roman coins were unearthed behind the church at Uzmaston. At the time of the 1851 census, Uzmaston belonged to a parish comprishing an area of 2,070 acres with a population of 683 people, 307 male and 376 female. Landmarks St. Ismael's Church Its parish church is dedicated to the 6th-century Breton prince and Welsh saint Isfael. In 1230 it was granted to Wizo the Fleming. It was extensively rebuilt in 1870-73 and renovated in 1991-92. It was further restored in 1999 by Hereford architect Lingen Barker. It became a Grade II listed building on 16 July 2004.

The film is a modern satire decrying pollution, waste and consumerism, animated in a 1950s educational film style. Plot After a brief history of the pollution imperative from before the Industrial Revolution to the present, the film follows a nuclear family polluting its way through an average day. The narrator explains that pollution is a critical part of our culture and keeps our economy strong. The film connects our wasteful, selfish habits with consumerism and its ally, big business. The resulting out-of-control pollution of the air, water and land is displayed in scenes of dismal destruction overlaid with happy music and cheerful calls by the narrator to pollute more for a better tomorrow. Production \\"Let's Pollute!\\" took more than three years to complete, primarily in the home studio of filmmaker Geefwee Boedoe. Boedoe wrote, directed, animated and produced the film with animation help from Tim Crawfurd and post-production help from a small team of mostly volunteers. In keeping with the 1950s style, the animation is very graphic and flat, while gritty textures underscore the pollution theme. Also in keeping with the techniques of that era and his own background of hand-drawn animation, Boedoe drew all the line work on paper with a black lithographic pencil and created the textures primarily with India ink on plastic sheets, rather than computer synthetic effects. He sketched out storyboards with pencil and paper and scanned them and artwork into his computer for editing. Music Much of the film's score is pre-recorded tracks by French musician Roger Roger. Two original tunes, composed by Geefwee Boedoe and performed by a group of his musician friends, are also on the soundtrack. Reception and awards \\"Let's Pollute!\\" was nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Film, Animated, by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). This is the first Academy Award nomination for Geefwee Boedoe. Let's Pollute! also took the Silver SpIFFy in the animated film category at the Spokane International Film Festival, the Big Muddy Film Festival and the Orlando Film Festival.

Its incidence has been estimated to be 1 in 500 patients, though this may be as high as 32% in some cases.  Signs and symptoms  Patients typically present within one week of surgery with eye pain, photophobia, conjunctivitis, or excessive tear production. Risk factors DLK is predominantly associated with Lasik, as the creation of a flap creates a potential space for cells to accumulate. Individuals with atopic conditions with pre-existing allergic conjunctivitis, or ocular rosacea, are more prone to developing the condition after surgery. Some authors have reported that moderate to severe eye allergies and chronic allergic conjunctivitis are an absolute contraindication to the LASIK procedure. This is in distinction to findings of earlier studies. Keratitis can also occur after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), although because it occurs in the setting of infection, it is distinct from the sterile infiltrates of DLK. DLK can also occur following myopic keratomileusis, in which a disc of corneal tissue is removed, shaped and sutured back into place, although this technique is more historical, having been replaced by Lasik and PRK.  Pathology  DLK is usually seen after refractive surgery. Neutrophils infiltrate the corneal stroma in a diffuse, multifocal pattern. Infiltration is confined to the surgical flap interface with no posterior or anterior extension, and overlying epithelium most often remains intact. As it is a sterile process, cultures based on swab tests are negative. Diagnosis = Stages = There are 4 stages of disease, with stage 4 being the rarest and most severe. * Stage 1 Cells infiltrate the periphery of the flap, without involving central cornea. * Stage 2 Peripheral cells migrate to the center of the cornea, and impair vision; presentation is usually 2 to 3 days after surgery. * Stage 3 Cells at the central cornea form clumps of dense cell aggregates. * Stage 4 Otherwise known as central toxic keratopathy, stage 4 characteristically has no inflammatory cells at the anterior chamber or cornea, but there is central stromal necrosis, and the cornea becomes opacified; onset is usually 3 to 9 days after refractive surgery. Treatment Depending on severity, therapies may range from topical or oral anti-inflammatories to irrigation and surgical repair.

May 3, 1733 ‚Äì November 8, 1809) was a British colonial militiaman and politician serving in Canada.  Early life  The year and location of Thomas Dixson's birth is not clear. The Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia 1758‚Äì1983: A Biographical Directory and the National Historic Sites designation list gives Dixson's birth as occurring on May 3, 1733 at Colchester, Connecticut to parents William and Rebeckah (or 'Rebecca') Dickson, whilst the entry in The Springhill Record commemorating Dixson's listing as a Person of National Historic Significance listed his birth as occurring in 1732 at Dublin, Ireland. As a young child, the Dixsons moved to Norwich, Connecticut.  French and Indian War  During the French and Indian War, Dixson moved to Fort Cumberland, Nova Scotia, soon after, and served as a militiaman in the capture of Fort Beaus√©jour in 1755. Dixson also served with Amherst at Montreal in 1760 and with Monckton in Havana in 1762.*  American Revolution  In 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, a band of revolutionaries led by Jonathan Eddy attempted to capture Fort Cumberland (Fort Beaus√©jour) as part of an effort to provoke Nova Scotia into joining the revolution against British control of the colonies. To resist this siege, known as the Battle of Fort Cumberland, Captain Dixson sailed himself and three volunteers in a small open boat across the Minas Basin (known for some of the highest tides on Earth), part of the Bay of Fundy, to warn the authorities in Halifax and bring reinforcements to the loyalists' aid. For this effort, Dixson was named a Person of National Historic Significance in 1938. On 20 August 1776, Dixson was elected a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia in a by- election to represent Cumberland County. In October 1778, Dixson became a Justice of the Peace for Cumberland County. In 1785, Dixson's term as a Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly member ended when New Brunswick separated from Nova Scotia. Dixson was subsequently elected to the same position he had held previously in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick, representing Westmoreland County. In 1802, Dixson retired from politics, and died on November 8, 1809, at Point de Bute, New Brunswick. He was survived by his wife and their eleven children.  Family  At some point prior to 1761, Dixson travelled south to Massachusetts and met Catherine Wethered (or 'Weatherhead'), whom he married in Kings Chapel in Boston on April 9 that year. That same year, Dixson received a land grant at Fort Beaus√©jour, but later moved to Point de Bute, New Brunswick. His half-brother Charles and his son Thomas Law also served in the Nova Scotia assembly.

It is located northwest of Prince George, Virginia. It was closed in 1983. History Fort Lee Air Force Station, located on the United States Army Fort Lee installation, was selected in 1956 for a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system direction center (DC) site, designated DC-04. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. This automated control system was used by NORAD for tracking and intercepting enemy bomber aircraft. In the later versions the system could automatically direct aircraft to an interception by sending instructions directly to the aircraft's autopilot. The 4625th Air Defense Wing was activated at the site under the 85th Air Division on 1 December 1956 to supervise the construction of the SAGE blockhouses and the installation and testing of the SAGE electronic and data processing equipment. The 4625th ADW was re-designated as the Washington Air Defense Sector (WaADS) on 8 January 1957 upon DC-04's activation, remaining under the 85th AD. The operation of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) direction center (DC-04) was the mission the WaADS. The Sector was disestablished on 1 April 1966, the SAGE operations were reassigned to the 33d Air Division, being moved to Fort Lee AFS from Richards-Gebaur AFB, Missouri. The 33d AD was inactivated on 19 November 1969, its assets being assumed by the newly reactivated 20th Air Division at Fort Lee AFS The DC-04 and the 20th Air Division were inactivated on 1 March 1983 by Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC).

She was bought off the stocks in 1974 and modified to comply with British standards for the Lewis service. She remained on the route until 1995, when she was replaced by the larger . Design The car deck featured two lanes either side of the central casing and featured two hoistable mezzanine decks for additional car capacity. Car deck access was via a two piece bow ramp and visor, with a single piece stern ramp. The superstructure featured a foremast above the wheel house carrying the radar scanners and aerials, and a main mast aft incorporated into the forward edge of the funnel, cleverly concealing the main engine exhausts. Her original single lounge bar saloon was soon divided with a screen to cordon off different areas. The cafeteria and servery was situated aft of the saloon and in common with vessels of the time, she was fitted out with a number of sleeping berths allowing passengers to embark the night before an early departure. Early in her Caledonian MacBrayne career, she was fitted with stabilisers, improving stability. Suilven was the first vessel in the Caledonian MacBrayne fleet to carry the fleet branding on the hull side in large steel letters, welded to the hull side. Air conditioning was fitted for her service in Fiji. Service Suilven was purchased for the Stornoway to Ullapool route, a replacement for the 1964 . She operated the route for 21 years, giving two crossings per day in summer reducing, until 1979, to one in winter. In October 1989, 's larger passenger capacity was required for those travelling to the M√≤d in Stornoway. For those 10 days, Suilven took over the Oban-Craignure service. By the 1990s, she was increasingly inadequate for the traffic on the service and unacceptably slow and the larger MV Isle of Lewis was built, offering superior capacity and facilities, entering service in July 1995. No longer required in Scotland, she was sold to Strait Shipping, for service between the North Island and South Island of New Zealand. In 2004, she was moved to Fiji and operated between Suva, Savusavu (on Vanua Levu) and Taveuni. In August 2012, Suilven was advertised for sale and expected to be sold as scrap for demolition; however, in late 2012, it was reported that Ben Naidu, owner of Venu Shipping, had acquired the ship for refitting and further service in Fiji, for an undisclosed sum. It was believed that, for the first time in her history, the ship would be renamed. On 24 November 2015 Suilven capsized in Suva harbour. There were no passengers aboard as the ship was only carrying cargo at the time of the incident, the crew were rescued, no one injured.

It is one of very few remaining independently owned newspapers in the country and has existed since 1855. The group previously distributed a free weekly newspaper, called the Ashton Reporter in recognition of the group's origins, and continues to publish the Glossop Chronicle. History The original 1855 publication's name was the Ashton Weekly Reporter, subtitled the Stalybridge and District Chronicle. It cost three halfpence and covered news primarily from Ashton-under-Lyne, Stalybridge, Mossley, Dukinfield, Droylsden, Hooley Hill, Denton and Hyde. The original Ashton Weekly Reporter with its circulation of 5,000 became the Ashton and Stalybridge Reporter. On 24 September 1859, 31-year-old William Hobson died of a kidney disorder and Edward Hobson became more involved in the running of the newspaper with the continued support of his surviving son. By 1886, circulation had exceeded 9,000. The rise in numbers was met by another name change, dropping Stalybridge from the title to become the Ashton Reporter. The following year, Edward Hobson senior died aged 66. Edward junior was the next to take the helm, aided by 19-year-old John Andrew, who had worked his way up from errand boy to a respected journalist at the paper. Edward's sister Martha was also involved, helping out as book keeper-cum- cashier. Martha and John's relationship blossomed and they were later married. The Evening Reporter was introduced in 1876 and proved a success. This saw Hobson and Andrew moving from the restricted Stamford Street premises. Andrew commissioned architects John Eaton & Son to design plans for a new office and contractors J. Barton and Son built the new premises on Warrington Street, overlooking Ashton Market. The first edition was printed there on 11 January 1879. The site was occupied by Marks and Spencer from the mid-1960s to 2013. Business boomed and in the 1880s the company bought six new Linotype machines to replace the out-dated presses. Type was then set up as a page in wooden frames, from which moulds of papier-m√¢ch√© were made. These were used to make stereotype plates, which were lowered by hoist to the ground floor. Here they were fitted to the 'Victory' rotary presses ready for printing. Andrew died in 1906 leaving his two sons, Edward and William, to take control of the Reporter and one of the brothers' first moves was to buy a new three-deck Foster press. In 1914, coinciding with the outbreak of the First World War, the Evening Reporter ceased publication after issuing 8,104 editions. On 4 November 1919, the flags on the Reporter office roof and Ashton Town Hall flew at half-mast to mark the death of Edward Andrew. Edward's brother William was now left in charge of the business. In 1925, the Reporter became a limited company and with the paper's continuing success and demand for bigger issues, the Foster press was enlarged, allowing for a 16-page edition to be printed. In 1934 the Reporter acquired the North Cheshire Herald, merging it with their Hyde Reporter. In 1937 the group took on the Glossop Chronicle. Gerald Andrew became managing director at the end of 1961, after the death of his uncle, William Andrew. At this time circulation stood at around 90,000, having risen from more than 50,000 before the war. Gerald revolutionised the paper in 1962 when news appeared on the front page for the first time (previously only advertisements were present). In October 1966, the Reporter moved out of Warrington Street to Waterside Mill off Whitelands Road, Ashton, where a new high-speed Crabtree Viscount rotary press was installed, which allowed colour printing. After spending years fighting off advances from United Newspapers, who were keen to buy the Reporter Group, Gerald Andrew finally conceded in February 1980. The change of ownership brought about more dramatic changes. Towards the end of 1984 the Denton, Droylsden and Mossley offices were closed. In March 1986, Ashton Weekly Newspapers left Waterside Mill and moved to Park House, Acres Lane, Stalybridge. The number of titles in the group was reduced from fourteen to eight. The Audenshaw Reporter became part of the Ashton Reporter and a Stalybridge and Dukinfield title was launched. Bredbury and Romiley, and Marple, ceased to have their own editions of the North Cheshire Herald. Droylsden and East Manchester were merged. Initially, the High Peak Reporter was absorbed by the Glossop Chronicle, but a few months later was reinstated. The Reporter appeared in tabloid form for the first time on 7 March 1986. At first it had a red masthead but this was quickly changed to blue. The Co-operative Press of Manchester did the typesetting. Printing took place at Central Lancashire printers at Wigan. Circulation had begun to fall in the 1970s and by the early 1990s only the Glossop Chronicle retained any buoyancy. This process worsened as free papers gained in popularity. A radical redesign, instituted by Frank Whalley when he became editor in 1993, had no effect and in many ways only accelerated the decline. The decision to drop amateur dramatics was particularly badly received. A trio of glossy colour magazines - In High Peak, In Tameside and In Saddleworth - only added to the financial losses. (Some years earlier a magazine called Juzz Jazz had lasted for only a handful of issues). In 1994 the Reporter began to move to the Apple Macintosh QuarkXPress system. It had first used direct input in early 1987, when composing was taken over by Lockie Press of Golbourne. Around 1990 the process was moved to the Burnley Express, as was printing. United Newspapers received an offer for Ashton Weekly Newspapers in 1997 and decided to accept. On 16 August the newly formed Reporter and Chronicle Newspapers Ltd legally took control. Heading the new firm were Martin Lusby and Barrie Holden, supported by backers 3i and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The pair previously held top-level positions with EMAP Newspapers. Martin Lusby was installed as chairman and Barrie Holden was managing director. The number of titles was quickly reduced to two - the Tameside Reporter and the Glossop Chronicle. Printing was moved around the country, to wherever offered the best deal. The Hyde office was closed as was the office on Old Street, Ashton, which the Reporter had occupied since the 1960s. The paper briefly used a room in the old post office on Warrington Street but by the start of the 21st century it no longer had a presence in its home town. The Glossop Chronicle office was sold in 2012. Full colour was quickly introduced. In 2007 the number of titles was increased with the reintroduction of an Ashton Reporter, this time a free newspaper covering the Ashton area. Like all other newspapers the Reporter was hit hard by the global banking crisis of 2007 when the housing market collapsed. It closed in September 2012, but was relaunched on 25 October. Reporter and Chronicle Newspapers Ltd sold the publications to the New Charter Housing Association which promised a new look for both titles, investment and growth. Much of the existing editorial team was left in place. New Charter established Quest Media as an umbrella organisation to run the Reporter and Tameside Radio, which came into its ownership in 2013. In 2015 both the newspaper and radio station were moved from Stalybridge to Cavendish Mill, Cavendish Street, Ashton-under-Lyne, marking the Reporters return to the town of its birth after a gap of more than ten years.

He is the youngest person to have held that post. Shelmerdine was the architect of several buildings in Liverpool. In 1875, he designed the gates and lodge at the Ullet Road entrance to Sefton Park. In 1890 he drew the plans for Kensington Library. This is an asymmetrical building, in brick and dressed stone, with a white cupola. In 1896 he designed Everton Library in Heyworth Street, in grimshell and redbrick, on a triangular site. Toxteth Library, in Windsor Street, a balanced English Renaissance style building, was set out by him in 1902. By 1904 he was setting out St John's Gardens at the back of St George's Hall, which now contain interesting examples of Victorian and Edwardian public sculpture. In 1906 he was working on the Hornby Library, designed to house Hugh Frederick Hornby's collection of books and prints. His last design for a library was that at Sefton Park, on Aigburth Road. The ground floor is of ashlar and roughcast, the first is half-timbered. It was the last of Thomas Shelmerdine's libraries, and was completed in 1911. His brother Henry Shelmerdine (1856-1935) was also an architect, who spent most of his career working for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

He signed his name as Placide P. Gaudet. Gaudet is noted for his research into the history and genealogy of the Acadian people and played an important role in the preservation of their history. He was born at Cap-Pel√©, New Brunswick, the son of Placide Gaudet and Marie Vienneau dit Michaud. Gaudet's father died shortly before his birth and his mother returned to her father's farm. She moved to her father-in-law's farm in Dorchester in 1862. Gaudet was educated at St. Joseph's College in Memramcook. He began studies for the priesthood at the Grand S√©minaire de Montr√©al but left in 1874 due to poor health, returning to New Brunswick. He then took on a number of short term teaching positions. From 1883 to 1885, he was given a contract by the Canadian archives to copy church archives in Acadian areas, supplementing his income by teaching. Gaudet worked for several newspapers including the Courrier des provinces Maritimes, Le Moniteur acadien and L'√âvang√©line. In 1890, Gaudet married Marie-Rose Arsenault. He taught at the Coll√®ge Sainte-Anne from 1895 until the college was destroyed in a fire in 1899. Later in 1899, he was hired by the Canadian archives to copy Acadian parish archives from Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. In 1906, Gaudet published Report concerning Canadian archives for the year 1905, a genealogy of Acadian families. As a result of his work and his own private research into local history, he became a noted authority and speaker on Acadian genealogy and history. Gaudet published Le grand d√©rangement in 1922.

However, during its long history, it moved between a number of sites in the town. History In 1552, on the order of Edward VI of England, Chantries were dissolved, effectively closing the Chantry School in Burnley. The lands that had funded the chantry, were purchased by some of the wealthy men of the parish and granted to the former chantry priests for the rest of their lives. This enabled the chantry school to continue to operate for a few more years. By 1558 it had become obvious that the chantries would not be restored and the men urged the endowment of a Free Grammar School, with additional gifts of land and rents. February 1, 1559, the Habergham deed was sealed marking the beginning of the Burnley Grammar School. The Towneley family - along with the Haydock, Habergham, Woodruff and Whitacre - were the founders and governors of the school.The National Archives Accessed 2010 St. Peter's Church, Burnley Its first headmaster was a former chantry priest, Gilbert Fairbank, with lessons initially taught at his home next to St Peter's Church (). In 1602, one of the governors, John Towneley, paid for a new schoolhouse to be built in the churchyard.Hall & Spencer, Burnley: A Pictorial History, p.[2] There was a dispute throughout the 1680s between the Catholic Towneleys and the school's Anglican governors over the choice of schoolmasters. This resulted in the building the construction of an Anglican schoolhouse () in 1693. The school is situated across the River Brun in an area then known as Brown Hill. In 1728 the Suffolk-based, Burnley born clergyman, Henry Halstead left a large collection of books to the School's library.MF Snape The Church of England in industrialising society: the Lancashire parish of Whalley Full text at Google books Former Burnley Grammar School (1874-1959) The school seems to have been in decline in second half of the 19th century, even as the town rapidly expanded around it. An education commissioner's report from the late 1860s showed attendance to be low and the schoolhouse in a poor state. Wealthy families shunned the school in favour of distant boarding schools, and several attempts to raise funds for a new building failed.Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire The Transactions, Volume 9 Vol. X p.19-24 Full text at Google books During 1871 the Governors of the school agreed to allow representatives of the Town Council and School Board to join them, in return for financial aid. This resulted in the 1874 opening of new school buildings across Bank Parade (), which can still be seen today.www.visitburnley.com. Accessed 6 November 2007 Despite an agreement at this time to establish a girls department once funding could be established, no action was taken. By the late 1890s, it looked like the school board would create a rival higher grade school,Sheila Fletcher Feminists and bureaucrats: a study in the development of girls' education in the nineteenth century Full text at Google books which would likely be disastrous for the grammar school. Some girls were allowed to attend from 1903 and it was taken over entirely by the council in 1904. It was decided that an equivalent girls school should be created and Burnley High School for Girls opened in Ormerod Road in 1910 (). It moved to a new building in the former grounds of Ivy Bank House in the 1951 (). In 1959 the grammar school moved once again to larger premises on Byron Street (), neighboring the girls school with Ivy Bank Secondary Modern School also constructed on the site in the 1960s. The school celebrated an annual founders day at St Peters. During the 70's it had very active Public Speaking & Debating Clubs (Mr JD Mitchell), a Photographic Society (Mr AG Stephenson), Film club (Mr Wardle), French Club (Madam Heap). Most boys took up to 10 GCE 'O' levels, and rarer subjects including Geology (Mr HH Grieve), Control Technology (Mr Stephenson), Additional Maths (Mr Grayson), Latin, were offered. The school was particularly successful at encouraging boys to read PPP/PPE at Oxford. The mixed comprehensive Habergham High School was formed in 1981, from the merger of two schools, with the girls school becoming the sixth form centre. Burnley Grammar Schools last Headteacher being Mr Keith Panter, Mr P Jennings and Mr GD Clayton (Death Notice September 2014) were his deputies. Staff included Mr JD Mitchell (Senior Teacher i/c Library), Mr Mel Saunders (Maths), Mr Bernard Grimes (Chemistry & Head of science), Mr W Slater (Biology), During this period, many new names were considered for the school including 'Burnley Collegiate School' which was deemed to be inappropriate. In 2006 Habergham merged with Ivy Bank to form Hameldon Community College, which in 2010 moved to a new building on Coal Clough Lane. In 2015 it was announced that the recently opened free school, Burnley High will construct a new building on the former Habergham site.

The ACES concept is intended to improve the on-orbit lifespan of current upper stages. In 2015, ULA announced conceptual plans to transition the Vulcan rocket to the ACES second stage, also referred to as Centaur Heavy, after approximately 2024. Vulcan will initially launch with the Centaur V upper stage. History (Advanced Common Evolved Stage) Two Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES) concepts were originally proposed in 2006 by both Boeing and Lockheed Martin. 2006: Centaur Extensibility For Long Duration, Gerard Szatkoski, et al, NASA/KSC and Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, (AIAA Space 2006 Conference Paper no. 60196), accessed 20 October 2015. By 2010, ULA had inherited the intellectual property of both proposals, and ACES had evolved into a new high-performance upper stage to be used on both Atlas V and Delta IV/Delta IV Heavy launch vehicles. Now called the Advanced Common Evolved Stage, ACES was intended to be a lower-cost, more-capable and more-flexible upper stage that would supplement, and perhaps replace, the existing ULA Centaur and Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) upper stages. This upper stage was intended to incorporate improved insulation for improved cryogenic storage and longer coast durations.2005: Atlas Centaur Extensibility to Long-Duration In-Space Applications, Bernard F. Kutter, Frank Zegler, et al, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, (AIAA 2005-6738), accessed 20 October 2015. In April 2015, the stage was reverted to the original Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage name, as the new Vulcan will be the only application, beginning no earlier than 2023. In Sept 2020 ULA stated they were no longer actively developing ACES. Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage , ACES was expected to debut on the Vulcan launch vehicle no earlier than 2023 but in July 2015 the timeframe was clarified to not likely fly until 2024‚Äì25. In 2018, ULA gave multiple presentations that again showed an ACES debut in 2023. In 2019 however, ULA said that while they still planned to develop ACES, they no longer have a specific date for when that will be. ACES will use ULA's proprietary Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF) technology to significantly extend its lifetime in space. ACES is planned to include common bulkhead propellant tanks with a diameter of , capable of carrying of propellant. =Vulcan Centaur Upper Stage= In late 2017, ULA decided to bring the diameter and advanced insulation elements of the ACES upper stage forward. Under the new plan, Vulcan's upper stage is the Centaur V, with two LH2/LOX RL-10 engines and no IVF. ACES is now expected to have the same tank diameter as Centaur V, but stretched, with the possible addition of two more RL-10s and IVF. Bringing critical items from ACES into the Centaur V development workstream in 2017 was expected to increase the lift capacity of the first generation Vulcan, so it could carry planned high mass, high energy national security reference payloads. The Centaur V was projected to permit ULA to retire both the Atlas V and Delta IV earlier than planned. On May 11, 2018 United Launch Alliance (ULA) announced that the Aerojet Rocketdyne RL-10 engine was selected for Centaur V, following a competitive procurement process. =Integrated Vehicle Fluids= The IVF technology uses a lightweight internal combustion engine to use hydrogen and oxygen propellant boil-off (normally wasted when boil-off gases are vented to space) to operate the stage. This includes producing power, maintaining stage attitude and keeping the propellant tanks autogenously pressurized. Using these fluids eliminates the need for hydrazine fuel, helium for pressurization, and nearly all batteries in the vehicle. IVF is optimal for depot operations, since only LH2 and LO2 need be transferred, and it extends mission lifetimes from the present dozens of hours to multiple days. , the internal combustion engine to be used to power the IVF system on ACES will be produced by Roush Racing. In August 2016 ULA's President and CEO Tory Bruno said both Vulcan and ACES were intended to be human rated. Possible applications One possible application for ACES is the use of the longer endurance and the greater fuel capacity as propellant depot with in- space refueling capability to retrieve derelict objects for near-space clean up and deorbit. These new approaches offer the technical prospect of markedly reducing the costs of beyond-LEO object capture and deorbit with the implementation of a one-up/one-down launch license regime to Earth orbits.

John's nickname is because before his election to the Patriarchal throne he held the office of hieromnemon within the Patriarchate. He was the nephew of a prominent Metropolitan of Chalcedon.Magdalino, p. 275. He was a cleric from within the scholarly, philosophical branch of the Church hierarchy, and had risen through the ranks of the patriarchal clergy.Magdalino, p. 275. He sought to reverse the secularising trend within the clergy by banning them from acting as advocates in civil courts. A lifelong scholar, he sought to reclaim the great, but dispersed, collection of books within the capital, as there was no central library. He made it a practice to acquire the book collections of deceased powerful men, and then had the patriarchal staff recopy them. His measures greatly expanded the range of titles held in the Great Church to which teachers were attached.Magdalino, p. 323-325. Within religious matters, he pushed the trend of making the patriarchal clergy, rather than the monastic community, the authoritative voice of Orthodoxy.Magdalino, p. 306. He also convened a synod in Constantinople in 1117 which condemned the doctrine of Eustratius of Nicaea as Nestorian, despite the defence offered by the Patriarch.Hussey, p. 151. During his patriarchate some efforts were made by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to bridge the schism between the Orthodox and the Catholic Church but these failed, as Pope Pascal II in late 1112 pressed the demand that the Patriarch of Constantinople recognise the Pope's primacy over \\"all the churches of God throughout the world\\". This was something the patriarch could not do in face of opposition from the majority of secular clergy, the monastic world, and the laity.Hussey, pp. 170-171.

Johann Marbach, engraving by Theodor de Bry. Life He was born at Lindau in Bavaria. He began his studies at Strasbourg in 1536, and three years later went to Wittenberg, where he shared a house with Martin Luther and took his doctor's degree in 1543. After holding temporary positions at Jena and Isny, in 1545 he accepted a call to Strasbourg. Here, from 1545 to 1558, he was pastor of the Church of St. Nicholas; canon at St. Thomas' from 1546; professor from 1549, and from 1551 president of the Church Convocation. In 1551 he was an envoy from Strasbourg to the Council of Trent. Until Martin Bucer's departure for England (1549) Marbach was on good terms with him as the recognized head of the Strasbourg Church, and remained a regular correspondent. Gradually, however, Marbach developed a more exclusive Lutheranism than that represented by other Strasbourg Reformers. In the position to the Swiss, Calvinistic, and Unionistic elements in Strasbourg, Marbach was the leader. The outcome of this conflict was evidenced in the Strasbourg Kirchenordnung of 1598, principally Marbach's work. From 1553 complaints began against the pastor of the local French refugee Calvinist congregation, Jean Garnier, because he did not hold the doctrine of the Strasbourg church on the Eucharist. He was obliged to leave Strasbourg in 1555. Also that year Peter Martyr, a teacher at the High School, left for Zurich to escape making declarations on the same topic. The last prominent advocate of Unionistic-Calvinistic theology at Strasbourg was Jerome Zanchi, also a teacher of the High School, and a member of the French congregation. When in 1560 Marbach reprinted at Strasbourg the treatise of the Lutheran Tilemann Hesshusen, De pr√¶sentia corporis Christi in c≈ìno Domini with the author's vehement preface against Frederick III, Elector Palatine and his theologians in Strasburg, open conflict broke out between Zanchi and Marbach. The main points of contention were the doctrines of the Eucharist, of Ubiquity (just then coming into prominence), and of the perseverance of the elect and predestination. Marbach advocated his views in three major works. He combatted not only the Calvinists but the Schwenkfeldians and Anabaptists, who were still active at Strasbourg; and introduced the Lutheran catechism (1554). He instituted private confession in the Church of St. Nicholas, and kept up the rite of confirmation when it began to fall into disuse in other Strasbourg churches. Marbach also took an active part in bringing about the acceptance of the Formula of Concord; and prevailed on the Strasbourg theologians to sign the Zerbst Formula (1571), while the official acceptance of the Formula of Concord was opposed by the town council. In the Palatinate he assisted Louis VI in 1576 to restore Lutheranism after the death of Frederick III. He died at Strasbourg.

The house was occupied by his descendants until 1960, when it was donated to and restored by a foundation controlled by his descendants. The house was listed by the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.Primitive Hall FoundationSchooler, 1971.The Story of Primitive Hall, Primitive Hall Foundation History Joseph Pennock (1677‚Äì1771) made a mysterious note in his Bible concordance dated September 14, 1738, \\"then my impostum brok and the Seme year I Bilt my nu Hous\\" which is taken to mean that Primitive Hall was built in 1738. He was born near Clonmel, Tipperary County, Ireland, and acquired the land in 1703 as a result of a 1683 purchase of 5,000 acres from William Penn by his grandfather, George Collet. Of the original 1,250 acres in West Marlborough Township conveyed by the purchase, Pennock kept 700 acres throughout his lifetime and gave the rest to one of his sons. He was a merchant in Philadelphia and used Primitive Hall as a country estate. Though he was a Quaker all or most of his life, one source reports that he was not a member of the Society of Friends at the time of his marriage.Smith, p. 492-3. Stairway on the ground floor of the central hall in 1960 Joseph married Mary Levis in 1705 and moved to West Marlborough Township by 1714. Mary bore 12 children and died in 1748. The foundations of a circa 1710 house are nearby. The family presumably lived in this house before moving into their new house, Primitive Hall, by 1740. During the early 1700s West Marlborough Township was on the frontier and Joseph reportedly left food out for Native Americans who would drop in and sleep in the central hall.See film, 5:25 Joseph was a member of the Pennsylvania Assembly from 1716 to 1744 and was also a Justice of the peace, performing his judicial duties in the old Chester Courthouse., see pages 144-146, 280 Iron bars in one of the cellar windows suggest that the cellar was used as a jail until the accused were transported to Chester.Schooler, p. 3. Joseph's son, Nathaniel, also served in the Pennsylvania Assembly, until his resignation in 1756 at the start of the French and Indian War, on the basis that a Quaker should not be a part of a government that was in a state of war. The house is furnished with much of its original furniture, including a settle bench that folds out into a bed. A table that Joseph bought from the old Chester Courthouse, the largest of its kind in the United States, still stands in the center hall of the house.See film, 7:00 The name \\"Primitive Hall\\" was first recorded about 1846 but is believed to be much older.

It was adapted from standard plans developed by William Penn for townhouses in Philadelphia - more precisely, it is two standard townhouses placed side by side, with a large brick floored center hall in between. The east and west sections each have a separate cellar and a separate chimney, but the central hall does not have a cellar. Corner fireplaces in each room connected to the section's single chimney. A staircase in the central hall ascends from the first to the third floor. A dozen of the house's windows were very large for their time, typically including 30 individual panes. A modern one-story brick kitchen was added to the north side of the house sometime after 1971. Gate leg table owned by Joseph Pennock The house is closely associated with the owners of the Lukens Steel Company of Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Isaac Pennock, a son or grandson of Joseph, started in the iron business in the 1790s. The business expanded under his son-in-law, Dr. Charles Lukens, and after Lukens's death in 1825, under Isaac's daughter, Rebecca Pennock Lukens. She was one of the first women owner-managers of a major industrial enterprise in the United States. After Rebecca's retirement in 1847, the business was run by her son-in-law Dr. Charles Huston. Stewart Huston, Charles's grandson, was a long-time executive of Lukens Steel and the last occupant of Primitive Hall, with ownership of the house never having left the family.Lukens Steel ‚Äî A Brief History In 1960 he deeded the house to the Primitive Hall Foundation, whose board is composed of descendants of Joseph Pennock.

Hollywood actor, pilot and Army Air Force Captain (later Brigadier General) James Stewart was posted to Sioux City with his squadron in 1943, where he and his crew completed their initial B-24 Liberator qualification prior to deployment overseas.Michael Simpson, History of the 445th Bomb Group, Revised Edition The training of B-17 crews continued until May 1945. Around that time, the field received a new mission which required the conversion of the facilities for B-29 Superfortress training.USAFHRA Document 00178231 The base was transferred to the 17th Bombardment Operational Training Wing and began the transition to start B-29 training.USAFHRA Document 00178233 By early June, there were ten B-29's on the field. The new training program was short lived, however because in August 1945 it was canceled. With the end of World War II, the former training base switched to becoming a processing center to discharge personnel out of the service and back into civilian life. With its mission completed, Sioux City Army Air Base closed in December 1945.USAFHRA Document 00178240 =Fighter-Interceptor base= However, the facility would not remain closed for long, as in September 1946 the airfield was opened by the Air Force Reserve. Sioux City Air Base was one of the first Air Force Reserve bases established after the war, and in December 1946 the 185th Iowa Air National Guard unit was established at Sioux City. Assigned to the new Air Defense Command (ADC) upon reactivation, the 140th Army Air Force base unit was activated as its host unit.USAFHRA Document 00180051 The mission of the 140th AFBU was to offer flight and ground training to all commissioned and enlisted members of the Air Force Reserve residing in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming.USAFHRA Document 00180054 During the 1950s, ADC based the 521st Air Defense Group at Sioux City beginning on 15 February 1953 as part of the Central Air Defense Force. The 521st had the 14th, 87th and 519th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons, equipped with F-86 Sabres, F-84 Thunderstreaks, and F-102 Delta Daggers. In 1955, the 521st was reassigned and replaced by the 13th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which flew with the 14th FIS from the base until 1960.Aerospace Defense Command publication, The Interceptor, January 1979 (Volume 21, Number 1). =ADCOM Radar Control Center= Beginning in 1959, the ADC flying activity was reduced and Sioux City became an ADC command and control base. The Sioux City Air Defense Sector (SCADS) was established on 1 October 1959 assuming control of former ADC Central Air Defense Force units in western Iowa, most of Nebraska along with southern South Dakota. In 1959 a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-22) was established at Sioux City AFS. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. The operation of DC-22 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer was the primary mission of SCADS, as well as providing air defense over parts of Minnesota, Colorado and Wyoming The Sector was disestablished on 1 April 1966 as part of an ADC consolidation and reorganization; its units were reassigned to the newly established 30th Air Division which took over operation of the SAGE DC-22. The 30th AD administered and trained subordinate units, and participated in numerous air defense training exercises. In addition, it supervised training of Air National Guard units with a pertinent mobilization assignment. DC-22 was inactivated in September 1968 as ADC phased down its interceptor mission as the chances of a Soviet bomber attack on the United States seemed remote, its mission being consolidated into North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). With the inactivation of the 30th AD, the Air Force closed Sioux City Air Force Station as an active-duty facility. Its facilities were turned over to Sioux Gateway Airport, along with the Air Force Reserve and Iowa Air National Guard for limited military use. Today, the Sioux City SAGE building is reportedly now a turkey processing plant. =Iowa Air National Guard= An air-to-air view of three Vought A-7D Corsair II aircraft in formation during Exercise TEAM SPIRIT'86 on 1 March 1986. The aircraft belonged to the 185th Tactical Fighter Group, Iowa Air National Guard, based at Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa (USA), which flew the A-7D from 1977 to 1992. Iowa ANG F-16s on the flight line at Sioux City, 1998 KC-135E departing Sioux City Airport for retirement The 185th Air Refueling Wing was established in December 1946. The Army Air Force's 386th Fighter Squadron, flying P-47 Thunderbolts, was activated in 1943 and then inactivated in 1945 at the end of World War II. The unit was subsequently re-designated the 174th Fighter Squadron and allocated to the Iowa National Guard on 24 May 1946. On 2 December 1946, the 174th was extended Federal recognition and equipped with P-51 Mustangs. Today, the 174th is still the flying squadron at the 185th Air Refueling Wing, formerly the 185th Fighter Wing. For three years, the 174th flew the P-51 Mustang, later redesignated the F-51 \\"Mustang after the U.S. Air Force became an independent service in 1947 and all Army Air Forces National Guard units became Air National Guard units. In 1949‚Äì50, the unit received its first jet, the F-84B \\"Thunderjet.\\" The squadron was called to active duty on 1 April 1951 for service during the Korean War and moved to Dow AFB in Bangor, Maine. Most jet pilots transferred to USAF units in Europe and the Far East. During its Korean service, the squadron was re-equipped with the F-51D . The unit finished their tour and was transferred back to state control on 31 December 1952. In July 1953, the unit converted from F-51Ds to the F-80C Shooting Star. In 1955, the 174th FS was re-designated the 174th Fighter Interceptor Squadron and was transitioned to the F-84E Thunderstreak as a component of the 132nd Fighter Interceptor Wing. In 1961, the unit was re- designated the 174th Tactical Fighter Squadron and converted to flying F-100C Super Sabre. On 1 October 1962, the unit reached group status and was reorganized and re-designated as the 185th Tactical Fighter Group. On 26 January 1968, the 185th was recalled to active Federal service as a result of the \\"Pueblo Crisis\\". The 174th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 185th augmented by many of the other personnel from the Group, deployed with their F-100s to Phu Cat Air Base, South Vietnam on 11 May 1968. During the course of the next 90 days, the balance of the 185th was deployed to six military bases in Korea and several others within the continental United States. As for the 174th, on 28 May 1969, the personnel and aircraft were recalled with the 185th and returned to Sioux City and released from active duty. In 1977, the 185th converted to the A-7D Corsair II. On 19 December 1991, the 185th converted aircraft again, receiving F-16 Fighting Falcons. On 16 March 1992, the 185th Tactical Fighter Group was re-designated the 185th Fighter Group. As the Air Force and Air Guard standardized unit structures, the 185th was designated the 185th Fighter Wing. The F-16 \\"Fighting Falcon\\" would be the last jet that the unit would fly before conversion to the KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft in 2003 and being re-designated the 185th Air Refueling Wing. In 2007, the 185th began transitioning from the KC-135E to KC-135R and KC-135T models with larger engines, capable of more missions. UA Flight 232 crash On July 19, 1989, Sioux City IAP / Sioux City ANG was the emergency landing site for United Airlines Flight 232 after a catastrophic failure of the plane's hydraulic system. The emergency landing happened to coincide with an activation of the base's Air National Guard force, which provided the maximum manpower on the airport including the firefighting forces of the local Air National Guard unit. The ANG firefighter's were only equipped to handle small commuter and Air Force A-7 aircraft, rather than a widebody jet such as the DC-10. It is widely recognized that the efforts of the Air Guardsmen at the Sioux City Airport contributed to many lives being saved after the crash of UA 232.

He is a Person of National Historic Significance. Biography Joseph Oleskiw (1860 ‚Äì 1903) Cyril Ivanovich Genik was born in 1857 in Bereziv Nyzhnii, Galicia, to father Ivan Genyk, a village mayor, and Ann Pertsovych. Genik began his studies at Kolomyja, before moving to what is now Ivano-Frankivsk to complete his teaching education. He completed his baccalaureate in Lviv before being appointed as a teacher in 1879 in Nadvirna county. In 1882, Genik returned to his home village and established a school there. During the 1880s, Genik established a milling business as well as a producers' cooperative that he named the Carpathian Store. In 1890, he was elected to the town council in the town of his initial studies, Kolomyja. Cyril and Paulina (Tsurkowsky) Genik and children, and the Jones family, 1906 At some point, Genik met Joseph Oleskiw, a man who had been encouraging immigration by Ukrainians to Canada. Oleskiw asked Genik if he could accompany and lead his second contingent of Ukrainians on their voyage to Canada and help them get settled. Genik and his family of his wife and four children joined a group of 64 Ukrainians in landing at Quebec City on June 22, 1896. Genik led his contingent firstly to Winnipeg and then to what was founded as Stuartburn, Manitoba, which is now considered to be the first Ukrainian Canadian community in Western Canada. In August, Genik applied for a homestead in Stuartburn, but quickly changed his mind and relocated to Winnipeg. That same month, Oleskiw recommended Genik to the Canadian Department of the Interior as an immigration agent. In September, Genik became an as-needed Department worker for the government's interpreting and translation needs. Father Nestor Dmytriw worked with him briefly in 1897‚Äì98 at the Immigration Hall in Winnipeg. In his job as an immigration agent, Genik met new Ukrainian Canadian immigrants at Quebec City, encouraged the use of English and the abandonment of traditional customs and served as a counsellor wherever necessary. His workload increased dramatically with the sharp rise in Ukrainian immigration to Canada ‚Äì so much, in fact, that by 1898 Genik had become a full-time salaried employee of the Canadian government.

In 1911, following the general election of that year in which Genik's favoured Liberal Party had lost office, Genik lost his job, and he finished his life in the public sphere. He lived for a while in the United States but returned to Winnipeg in his later life, where he died on February 12, 1925. By the time of his death, Genik had become so well known in the Ukrainian Canadian community that he had come to be known as the \\"Czar of Canada\\".

He was married at Albany, New York, on March 2, 1869, to Miss Emma D. Weeks, a native of Vermont. He died in Bozeman, Montana on January 26, 1919. Early years Lester Willson was born in Canton, New York on June 16, 1839, the son of Ambrose and Julia Willson. He was one of seven children and had at least two brothers, Davis and George. His brother Davis would play a prominent role in Lester's later career as a businessman in Montana. He attended public schools in Canton and graduated from a prominent Academy before working as a clerk for two years and then volunteering for the Union Army in 1861. Civil War experiences Willson in 1865 Willson enlisted in Company A, Sixtieth New York Volunteers, August, 1861, was enrolled second sergeant September 9, 1861, a lieutenant October 3, 1862, first lieutenant and adjutant November 17, 1862. He was offered a captaincy on the same day the adjutant's commission was received, but declined. He was made captain August 2, 1864, lieutenant-colonel October 1, 1864 and colonel May 17, 1865. Willson left the regiment July 17, 1865 as a colonel. On March 12, 1867,the original document states March 13, 1865, and was recorded march 12 1867 he was brevetted brigadier-general of volunteers \\"for gallant and meritorious services under General Sherman, resulting in the fall of Atlanta, Georgia.\\" =Campaigns= During the winter of 1861-62, Willson participated in guarding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and campaigns in Virginia under generals Nathaniel Banks and John Pope. He fought at the Battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862. On May 5, 1863, he was severely wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville Virginia. He did not return to duty until September 1863 under General Joseph Hooker when the XI and XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac moved westward to reinforce the Army of the Cumberland around Chattanooga, Tennessee. There Willson participated in the battles of Wauhatchie, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Peavine Creek, and Ringgold Gap. In 1864-65 he campaigned under General William Sherman and participated in the Chattanooga Campaign, the Atlanta Campaign, the Savannah Campaign and the Carolinas Campaign. As an aide, assistant inspector-general, and assistant adjutant-general, Willson was present at significant events during these campaigns. In Atlanta, his regiment, the 60th New York Volunteers share the honor of unfurling the union flag on top of the city hall with the 111th Pennsylvania Infantry. As assistant adjutant-general under the command of General John W. Geary he received the surrender of Savannah at the hands of its mayor R. D. Arnold, and was the first officer to enter the city at the head of his own regiment. The regiment entered the city unopposed and met the mayor and a delegation of the City Council instead of troops. Once Willson received the surrender his regiment quickly began providing protection to the citizens of Savannah from the mobs that had begun breaking into houses and plundering. Throughout the war Willson enjoyed the confidence of his superiors and on more than one occasion he was entrusted with intricate and dangerous duties by General Sherman. Major General George S. Greene credited him with being a most faithful and intelligent officer, and of his regiment (60th New York Volunteers) Greene has said, \\"It was one of the best in the service.\\" =New York State Militia= At the close of the war Willson held the rank of lieutenant colonel. His successful service and close association with many senior officers caused him to be appointed assistant quartermaster-general of the New York State Militia with the rank of colonel. For two years he was responsible for post-war dealings with the railroad companies regarding the transportation of troops, supplies, etc., the reconciliation of balances between the state and the general government, and the disposition of accumulated supplies belonging to the state. Working alongside Lester was his cousin Charles Rich and army friend, Loren W. Tuller. In December, 1865 after hearing a presentation on the western U.S. by then Speaker of the House of Representatives, Schuyler Colfax, Lester Willson got the wanderlust. He convinced his co-workers to that they should go to Montana and start a mercantile business. Unfortunately, Lester could not leave his New York job unfinished and did not join Rich and Tuller until 1867. However, he did invest in the business enterprise and enlisted the participation of his younger brother Davis to join Rich and Tuller in the 1866 journey to Montana. After reaching Omaha, Nebraska in May 1866, Davis Willson, Rich and Tuller invested over $5000 in supplies, merchandise and transportation to embark on an overland journey to Bozeman, Montana. Their journey took them west along the Platte River Road to Fort Laramie, Wyoming and then northwest along the Bozeman Trail. They arrived safely in Bozeman on September 2, 1866 with little interference by hostile Indians along the Bozeman Trail. They operated a successful store out of a tent for two months and by the end of 1866, they had moved into a rented cabin on main street with a sign that read: \\"Tuller and Rich - Cheap Cash Store\\". Davis quickly established a corral attached to the cabin and named it \\"Empire Corral\\". The business flourished as they freighted supplies to the mining camps in Bannack and Virginia City, Montana. By the spring of 1867, Lester Willson had found a prospective wife, Emma D. Weeks, and had finished his important postwar work for the New York State Militia. He resigned the office in March, 1867 to engage in business in Montana. Montana merchant Tuller and Rich Store, Bozeman, 1866 Lester and Emma Willson's 1st home in Bozeman, 1869 Willson House, built in 1886 by Lester Willson Lester Willson left New York in April 1867 taking a much less arduous route to Bozeman. The Bozeman Trail was now closed because of Indian trouble so Lester traveled by Union Pacific passenger train from Chicago to Platte City, Missouri. From there, stagecoaches carried General Willson to Denver, Colorado, Salt Lake City, Utah and on to Virginia City, Montana. He met with then Territorial Governor of Montana, Thomas F. Meagher in Virginia City and arrived in Bozeman on May 22, 1867. He became an active partner with his brother Davis, Rich and Tuller in running the mercantile business which was now flourishing because of the construction of Fort Ellis just west of town. In January, 1868 he returned to New York and proposed to Miss Emma D. Weeks. By May, he was back in Bozeman helping run the business. In January 1869, Willson returned to Albany, New York to marry Miss Emma D. Weeks on March 2, 1869, and bring her back to Bozeman. Returning via a Missouri River steamboat to Fort Benton, Montana, Lester, Emma and her piano were back in Bozeman by mid-May 1869. They soon moved into a remodeled cabin originally built by Daniel E. Rouse in 1864 in what was at the time one of the finest residences in Bozeman. Tuller left the business in 1868 and Davis Willson in 1870 to rejoin for a short period in 1872. Davis Willson eventually became a Presbyterian minister in the 1880s and the pastor of a small Gallatin Valley church. Lester Willson sold \\"The Willson Company\\" in 1914 five years before his death in 1919. In August 1870, Lester and Emma had the opportunity to entertain the civilian members of the Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition for dinner in their home on the evening before they left Bozeman on their historic expedition to Yellowstone. Willson was a board member on the first executive board of the Agricultural College of Montana when it was established in 1893. In 1882, along with Nelson Story, J.E. Martin, Broox Martin, and Edwin Lewis, Willson helped capitalize one of the first banks in the county, the Gallatin Valley National Bank. The bank failed during the Panic of 1893 and never reopened. Montana politician While serving in New York, Willson became active in the Union Party (Republican), politics which he brought with him to Montana. Shortly after arriving in Bozeman, Willson was instrumental in the establishment of a Bozeman chapter of the Union League, a quasi-ritualistic, patriotic society (Republican) in the hope that Montana politics would soon be dominated by Republicans. Willson soon became a Union Party elector for the 1867 federal elections. In September, 1868 he won a seat in the Montana Territorial Legislature representing Gallatin County, Montana. Willson was a Mason and a member of Bozeman Lodge No. 18, A. F. & A. M. He was charter member of the William English Post No. 10, Grand Army of the Republic and was a department commander of Montana. Willson also belonged to the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in New York, and to the Republican Club of the city of New York. In 1883-86 he served as territorial quartermaster-general with the rank of brigadier-general. Legacy Willson family plot at Sunset Hills Cemetery. Lester S. Willson headstone is in the right rear. In 1886 Lester and Emma built a home at 504 Central Ave, just blocks from downtown. It still stands today on Willson Avenue, a major residential thoroughfare intersecting Bozeman's West Main Street. After his death, the city renamed Central Avenue to Willson Avenue, for Lester Willson. Emma and Lester Willson had three children. Only one, Fred Fielding Willson survived to adulthood. Fred Willson became a prominent Bozeman architect and was responsible for a great many Bozeman buildings still standing today. He designed the Gallatin County High School, which was named Willson School in his honor when the building was converted from a high school to a middle school. Lester Willson died on January 26, 1919 and is buried in the Willson family plot, Sunset Hills Cemetery, Bozeman, Montana.

The ravine has several springs and a brook streaming at its bottom. Up in the ravine, on the left side of it, there is a Neopagan shrine, organized around two venerated \\"sacred stones\\". In years 2006‚Äì2007, during the renovation of Kolomenskoe sides of the ravine were reinforced, and pedestrian paths and stairs were created on its sides.  History  Since ancient times this ravine has always been a bit of a mystery. Inexplicable things constantly happened here in the past. For example, one amazing story was described in the 17th-century sources. In 1621, a small detachment of Tatar horsemen turned up at the walls of the Tsar's palace in Kolomna. They were surrounded and captured immediately by the warriors, who guarded the entrance to the palace. Being lost and disoriented, they claimed to be part of the armies of the Crimean khan Devlet I Giray that had attacked Moscow in 1571. Sensing defeat and wanting to avoid capture, they retreated into Golosov ravine, where they were quickly enveloped in a thick mist. Spending what seemed like only a few minutes finding their way through the fog, they emerged to find that 50 years had already passed. One of the captives, named Murza, said that the mist was unusual, of light green colour, but none of them paid attention to it, due to fear of the chasing. Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich ordered to undertake an inquiry, which showed that the men ‚Äúprobably told the truth.‚Äù They had even old-fashioned armor and ammunition, mostly of 1560s or 1570s types.http://www.gazetanv.ru/article/?id=167 This wasn't the only reported incident of time travel in the surroundings of Golosov Ravine. In the 19th century, such cases were documented by the Moscow province's police office. One story was published in the newspaper ‚ÄúMoscovkie vedomosti‚Äù in July 1832. Two local peasants, Arhip Kuzmin and Ivan Botchkarev, had a big night out at a neighboring village and decided to take a shortcut through the ravine on their way home. There was the same thick green mist that filled the ravine, where a strange corridor suddenly appeared. The peasants stepped down into it and met large and hairy manlike creatures, who managed to put them back on the right path via hand signals. A few minutes later, the peasants left the ravine and continued their way. When they eventually came to their native village, it turned out that two decades had already passed. Their wives and children did not recognize them. The incident was reported to the police who conducted an investigation, during which one of the men dissolved into the fog and never returned. Down through the centuries, people have been periodically seen hairy human-resembling creatures round Golosov ravine. Such cases were mentioned not only in the ancient and medieval chronicles, but also in the Soviet periodical press. Large hairy manlike creatures most likely represent the leshy - a sort of bigfoot from Slavic mythology, who is more man than ape and more woodland spirit than mortal creature. In 1926, a policeman reported seeing a ‚Äúhairy wild man‚Äù over two meters tall (6.6 ft) in Golosov Ravine. The policeman pulled out his pistol, but the strange creature instantly dissolved in the fog. Local schoolchildren joined the search for the unusual guest, but they were unable to detect his traces. However, one of the official Moscow newspapers published the article ‚ÄúYoung Pioneers (Soviet Boy Scouts) are capturing a leshy‚Äù, by the journalist A.Ryazantsev.  The sacred stones  The \\"sacred stones of Kolomenskoe\\" are a pair of local sandstone rocks of peculiar shape, located high in the ravine. Some sources claim them to be granite boulders of glacial origin, but this seems to be a misconception. Both rocks have traces of manual processing, both old (exaggerating the shape of the stones), and new (as they have been vandalized by modern graffiti).

The film's runtime is approximately 15 minutes. It was written and directed by first-timer Michael Creagh, and produced by Damon Quinn. The film was shot during Easter 2009 in Skerries, north Dublin. Creagh cast his nine-year-old son Oran in the lead role of the story. The story sees an eight-year-old schoolboy (played by Oran Creagh) fall in love with his teacher, Miss Purdy. One day he gives her a toy ring to show his affection. But heartbreak abounds when he bumps into Miss Purdy and her boyfriend having just bought a very real engagement ring. Devastated and spurned, Ardal challenges Miss Purdy‚Äôs fianc√© to a duel to the death. Plot Eight-year-old Ardal Travis has a crush on his second class teacher, Ms. Purdy. He demonstrates his affections by giving her a toy ring. While shopping with his mother, Ardal sees Ms. Purdy, who happily explains that she has just been proposed to by her boyfriend Pierce and is engaged to be married. Pierce appears to be a jerk: he refuses to take Ms. Purdy for lunch to celebrate the hour-old engagement, instead insisting on going home to watch football. Ardal sees his dad put a gun carefully in the closet; he stares into the closet contemplating his options. Ardal confronts Pierce while Pierce is impatiently waiting for Ms. Purdy outside of the school. Ardal challenges Pierce to a duel to the death, which Pierce mockingly accepts. The next day, Ardal meets Pierce in the school yard. Pierce forgets his gun on purpose and Ardal pulls a gun on him. Pierce at first believes it is a toy, but Ardal insists it is not. Ms. Purdy attempts to intervene but Ardal refuses to back down. Pierce, reduced to a crying mess says he never loved Ms. Purdy but only proposed to her to ‚Äúshut her up.‚Äù Ardal shoots Pierce and he falls to the ground. It is revealed that the gun was a toy after all, one that Ardal‚Äôs father was saving in the closet until his birthday. Ms. Purdy angrily calls off the engagement and breaks up with Pierce. She walks Ardal home, agreeing to ‚Äúkeep this between ourselves.‚Äù Ardal then tells Ms. Purdy that he doesn't deserve to marry her as well because he is \\"financially unstable and can't cater to all [her] needs\\" and that a woman like his teacher should get everything she wants. They then continue to walk hand in hand. At the beginning of the movie Ms. Purdy asked her students to look up the three words (Reveal, Pretend and Love), these three words summarize the whole film. Accolades The film was awarded Best Irish Short at the 23rd Foyle Film Festival. On 25 January 2011, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film at the 83rd Academy Awards.

After his disqualification from the space program on medical grounds, he was an instructor at the cosmonaut training centre outside Moscow. Early life Varlamov was born on 15 August 1934 in Sukhaya Tereshka in the Talchinska district of the Penza oblast. After World War II, Varlamov's family moved to Kyrgyzstan where Varlamov continued his schooling. Among his classmates was fellow future cosmonaut candidate, Mars Rafikov, who was almost a year older. His family then moved to the Orenburg region where Varlamov completed his schooling. He attended the Air Force introductory school in western Siberia, followed by the Kacha Higher Air Force school and finally the Stalingrad (Volgograd) Military Aviation school where he graduated with a commission as a pilot. He gained his lieutenant's wings in 1955. By 1956, Varlamov was a fighter pilot with the 3rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment which was responsible for the defence of Orel. He was made chief pilot in the regiment and promoted to senior lieutenant.

Varlamov showed great potential as a cosmonaut candidate, being physically fit and highly intelligent. With the completion of the Vostok simulator, he was selected for a special group of six candidates for accelerated training, along with Yuri Gagarin, Anatoly Kartashov, Andrian Nikolayev, Pavel Popovich and Gherman Titov. Known as the \\"Sochi Six\\", this group's purpose was to train the best of the existing candidates of TsPK and enable selectors to choose the candidate who would be first in space. =Discharge= In 1960 Varlamov was promoted to captain. While on holiday in June that year with other cosmonaut candidates Georgy Shonin and Valery Bykovsky at Medvezh'i Ozrea (Bear Lakes) near Moscow, Varlamov suffered a neck injury after diving into shallow water. While he recovered from a displaced vertebra, medical officers found further anomalies in his bone structure and he was medically disqualified from the program. He was discharged in 1961 and his place was taken by Bykovsky. =Cosmonaut Training Centre= Despite his discharge Varlamov did not leave the cosmonaut training centre as other unsuccessful candidates had done. He was well regarded by his peers and continued to work in the TsPK in administrative roles until the flight of Vostok 1 where he served as \\"deputy chief of the command point for controlling space flights.\\" In 1963 he became a senior instructor specialising in astronavigation at the cosmonaut training centre.

A ","title":"List of painters by name beginning with &quot;A&quot;"},{"id":"30630464","text":"Vienna Museum main building on Karlsplatz The Vienna Museum ( or Museen der Stadt Wien) is a group of museums in Vienna consisting of the museums of the history of the city. In addition to the main building in Karlsplatz and the Hermesvilla, the group includes numerous specialised museums, musicians' residences and archaeological excavations. The permanent exhibit of art and the historical collection on the history of Vienna include exhibits dating from the Neolithic to the mid-20th century. The emphasis is on the 19th century, for example works by Gustav Klimt. In addition, the Vienna Museum hosts a variety of special exhibitions.  History  Originally known as the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna (Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien), its existence dates back to 1887, and until 1959 was located in the Vienna Town Hall (Rathaus). The first plans for a city museum on Karlsplatz date back to the beginning of the 20th century; one of proposed plans were drawn by the renowned Jugendstil architect Otto Wagner. However, not least because of two world wars, the building of the museum was postponed for several decades. In 1953, the City Council of Vienna passed a resolution to honour Austrian president and former mayor Theodor K√∂rner, on the occasion of his 80th birthday by making the museum building a reality. A design contest was organised, in which 13 architects were specifically invited to take part (including Clemens Holzmeister, Erich Boltenstern and Karl Schwanzer) but which was open to any other entrants. Designs were evaluated by a jury which was chaired by the architect Franz Schuster and whose other members were the architects Max Fellerer and Roland Rainer, the Vienna Director of Building, the Director of City Collections, Franz Gl√ºck, the Head of the City Department of Regulations and the Head of the Department of Architecture. 80 contestants took part and submitted a total of 96 designs. The jury awarded Oswald Haerdtl fourth place, but he was subsequently \\"off-handedly\\" contracted to design the building, which was executed in an unassuming contemporary modern style. Haertl was also responsible for the interior design, down to the furnishing of the director's office. The museum opened on 23 April 1959 as the first newly built museum of the Second Republic, and remained the only such for decades.Juli 1953: Der Wettbewerb f√ºr den Museumsneubau, Wien im R√ºckblick November 1953: Museum der Stadt Wien: Die erste Besichtigung der Wettbewerbsentw√ºrfe, Wien im R√ºckblick The Historical Museum repeatedly distinguished itself with its exhibitions. In 1985, under director Robert Waissenberger, it presented the Jugendstil exhibition Traum und Wirklichkeit (Dream and Reality) at the Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus on the opposite side of the square; with more than 600,000 visitors, one of the most successful exhibitions ever held in Vienna. In 2000, the courtyard was roofed over. In 2003, under the direction of Wolfgang Kos, the museums of the City of Vienna were united under the umbrella name of Vienna Museum and the Historical Museum was renamed Vienna Museum. In early 2006, the foyer was renovated and in addition, new exhibition space was created in what had been a storage area. One of the exhibition rooms The main building of the museum presents a mix of historical and art exhibits with the intent of offering the visitor a cross section of the development of the city, from its beginnings in the Neolithic through the Roman camp of Vindobona up to the 20th century. In addition to the permanent exhibits, there are frequent special exhibitions.

Under former mayor Bruno Marek, the building was restored by the Association of Friends of the Hermesvilla and subsequently taken over by the city. The permanent exhibition is dedicated to the history of the building and the imperial couple, who spent a few days there each year until Elisabeth's death. In addition, special exhibitions are mounted on a wide variety of themes in cultural history. Special museums =Otto Wagner Pavilion on Karlsplatz= thumb Since 2005, a permanent exhibition on the life and work of Otto Wagner has been on show in this former Vienna Stadtbahn building. The building was constructed in 1898 as one of a pair of Jugendstil pavilions on either side of the square as part of the construction of the Stadtbahn in the 1890s; Otto Wagner was the contract designer of the system. During the planning in the 1960s for the new Vienna U-Bahn nodal station at Karlsplatz, the two pavilions were saved from demolition, dismantled, restored, and put back in place in 1977 after completion of the construction work in the square. They no longer serve any transport purpose. =Otto Wagner Hofpavillon at Hietzing= thumb The Pavillon des k.u.k. Allerh√∂chsten Hofes (Pavilion of the royal and imperial court) in Hietzing near Sch√∂nbrunn Palace was built in 1899 to Otto Wagner's design as a special station for the use of the Emperor and members of his court when using the Stadtbahn. It was not included in the original plans for the Stadtbahn, but Wagner began construction on his own initiative and was finally able to win over the Minister for Railways, Heinrich von Wittek. In contrast to the other Stadtbahn stations, this pavilion with its cupola has baroque elements, which could be interpreted as a sign of respect for the Emperor on the architect's part. It was built at the inbound end of the platform at the Hietzing station, which opened in 1898; originally there were steps linking it to the public platforms. The Emperor is only known to have used the station on two occasions: in 1899 when he opened the lower Vienna Valley line on the Stadtbahn (between Meidling Hauptstra√üe and Hauptzollamt) and in April 1902. Today the imperial waiting room and study and other rooms in the building are on permanent display. =Prater Museum= The Prater Museum is located in the Prater park, in the planetarium building near the Ferris wheel. It presents the history of Vienna's largest amusement park, the Wurstelprater, with exhibits such as an old mechanical fortune-teller and coverage of dark rides and sideshows. The museum was founded in 1933 by the teacher and local historian Hans Pemmer in his home and donated in 1964 to the City of Vienna, which built the present museum.Prof. Hans Pemmer, der unerm√ºdliche Volksbildner , Bezirksmuseum Landstra√üe, Die Wiener Bezirksmuseen, Museen.net =Clock Museum= Entrance to Clock Museum in Palais Obizzi The Vienna Clock Museum in the Palais Obizzi in the Innere Stadt, founded in 1917, is one of the most important of its kind on Europe. On the ground floor are displayed the collections of the museum's first and long- time director, Rudolf Kaftan, and of the poet Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach. During the Second World War, the \\"House of Ten Thousand Clocks\\", as it is also known, was closed and attempts were made to disperse the valuable clocks for safety to various castles in Lower Austria, with only partial success. After the war, work began on rebuilding the collection; thanks to funds from the City of Vienna and private donations, it has been possible to add a few additional rarities to the collection.Juni 1947: Das Haus der zehntausend Uhren, Wien im R√ºckblick =Fashion collection library= The Vienna Museum has a fashion collection in Meidling, adjacent to the Vienna School of Fashion at Schloss Hetzendorf. This is not open to the public, but the public may use the attached library, consisting of over 12,000 volumes and numerous periodicals, photographs and approximately 3,000 engravings on the subject of fashion. Musicians' residences The Vienna Museum includes numerous residences in which notable composers lived, were born and died, which are largely in original condition and intended to afford the visitor insight into the artists' everyday lives. Exhibits include music manuscripts, but also objects they used. =Mozart residence= The rooms in the Mozarthaus Vienna in Domgasse, near St. Stephen's Cathedral, are the only one of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's residences in Vienna to have been preserved (and the original furnishings have not been preserved). Mozart lived here from 1784 to 1787, during which time he composed, among other works, his opera The Marriage of Figaro, for which reason the house is also known today as the Figaro House. The flat has been open to visitors for decades; it was reopened in early 2006 after renovation. The house has several floors of exhibition space including objects such as the desk at which Mozart supposedly composed The Magic Flute. =Beethoven residence in Heiligenstadt= Ludwig van Beethoven spent the summer of 1802 in a house in Heiligenstadt, which at the time was a suburb of Vienna. There was a spa, where Beethoven attempted to reduce or cure his increasing deafness. During this stay, he worked on compositions including his Second Symphony, but also -- in an episode of depression and despair about the state of his hearing ‚Äî wrote his Heiligenstadt Testament. According to oral tradition, the house was Herrengasse 6, now Probusgasse 6; this is however disputed, since at the time there were no registration records for the suburbs of Vienna and Beethoven's own letters do not mention the address. =Eroica House= The Eroica House is a memorial to Beethoven's stay in Oberd√∂bling in the summer of 1803, during which he composed a large part of his Eroica Symphony. However, Beethoven never stayed in the house. Josef B√∂ck-Gnadenau misidentified the building, because he was unaware that the houses were re- numbered in 1804, rather than 1802. In 1872, Alexander Wheelock Thayer had identified the correct house: Hofzeile 15, which no longer exists. =Pasqualati House= In 1804-08 and 1810-14, Beethoven lived at the house of his patron Johann Baptist Freiherr von Pasqualati on the M√∂lker Bastei (M√∂lk Bastion, a remnant of the old city walls) in the Innere Stadt. Here he composed, among other works, the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, F√ºr Elise, the Archduke Trio and his only opera, Fidelio. Since Beethoven's actual flat in the north section of the fourth floor has a tenant, the next-door flat is on show as the Beethoven exhibit. =Haydn House= Haydn House, around 1840 In 1793, Joseph Haydn acquired the house which is now Haydngasse 19 in Mariahilf, and lived there until his death in 1809. The original address was Kleine Steingasse 71 (changed in 1795 to 73), and it was located in the hamlet of Obere Windm√ºhle, which was part of the outlying town of Windm√ºhle but was almost entirely surrounded by the larger town of Gumpendorf and was part of its parish. Here Haydn composed, among other works, the oratorios The Creation and The Seasons. In 1862, the street was renamed for its most famous residents, and the house has been a memorial since 1899 and a museum since 1904. In one of the rooms, Johannes Brahms' composing desk is on display. In 2009, the 200th anniversary year of Haydn's death, the permanent exhibition was recast and enlarged; it emphasises the composer's last years. =Birthplace of Franz Schubert= Schubert birthplace in Alsergrund Franz Schubert spent the first four and a half years of his life in this house in Nu√üdorfer Stra√üe in Himmelpfortgrund in what is now Alsergrund, the 9th district of Vienna. One important exhibit is Schubert's 'trademark' glasses. The house also has on display approximately 50 paintings by Adalbert Stifter, who was better known as an author. =Schubert's deathplace= Schubert spent only the last two and a half months of his life in his brother Ferdinand's flat in Kettenbr√ºckengasse in Wieden, where he died in 1828. Exhibits include his last drafts of compositions and a copy of the last letter he wrote by hand, to Franz von Schober. =Johann Strauss residence= The flat in Praterstra√üe in Leopoldstadt was the residence of Johann Strauss the Younger in the 1860s. Here he composed among other works the Blue Danube waltz, whose first notes traditionally inaugurate the New Year for the Viennese. Archaeological excavations The Vienna Museum includes a number of archaeological sites which document various periods in the history of the city. All are located in the Innere Stadt. =Michaelerplatz excavations= Michaelerplatz excavations Archaeological excavations in the Michaelerplatz between 1989 and 1991 uncovered among other things the settlement of Canab√¶ associated with the Roman camp at Vindobona. This will have consisted primarily of the residences of soldiers' wives and children. The excavation site was made permanently accessible to the public in 1991; the design of the presentation is by architect Hans Hollein. =Vergilius Chapel= The Vergilius Chapel near St. Stephen's Cathedral was built around 1250, but in the 14th century became a crypt for a wealthy family. In 1732 the cathedral graveyard was abandoned and in 1781 the adjacent Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene burnt down, following which the Vergilius Chapel was filled in and eventually forgotten. It now lies approximately 12 metres under the Stephansplatz and was rediscovered in 1973 during the building of the U-Bahn; it is now integrated into the Stephansplatz station and can be reached from there. =Museum of the Romans= Remains of a hypocaust from a Roman house at Museum of the Romans In the Hoher Markt north of Stephansplatz, excavated ruins of houses which served as officers' quarters in Vindobona are on display, together with exhibits of ceramic ware, gravestones and other objects which illuminate life 2,000 years ago in the Roman camp and attached town. This museum annexe, previously known as the \\"Roman Ruins\\", was expanded and reopened in May 2008 as the Museum of the Romans.\\"Die R√∂mer kommen nach Wien\\", ORF 10 May 2008 =Roman ruins under fire headquarters= In the cellar of the fire headquarters in Am Hof are the remains of a main drainage canal which once carried effluent from the southern section of the Roman camp to the brook which is now the street Tiefer Graben. Preserved in original condition, they were discovered in the 1950s during excavations for the foundations when the fire headquarters, destroyed by World War II bombing, were being rebuilt. At a depth of almost 3 metres, ruins of a wall of the Roman camp, a wall tower, part of a street which ran beside the wall and an approximately 5 metre stretch of the canal below the wall were uncovered.Juli 1958: Ein r√∂mischer Kanal unter der Feuerwehrzentrale, Wien im R√ºckblick =Neidhart frescoes= The Neidhart frescoes are in a 14th-century building in Tuchlauben and are the oldest surviving secular wall paintings in Vienna. The cycle of paintings were executed in 1398 on the walls of a then banqueting room on a commission from the wealthy merchant Michel Menschein. For the most part they show scenes from the life of the minnesinger Neidhart von Reuental. They were discovered in 1979 under a layer of plaster when the building was being renovated, and have been on view to the public since 1982.Neidhart Fresken, Burgenkunde.at References External links * Vienna Museum homepage * Vienna Museum English homepage * Interactive 360¬∞ x 180¬∞ panorama of Vienna Museum Karlsplatz: requires Flash Category:Architecture museums Category:Art museums and galleries in Vienna Category:Biographical museums in Austria Category:Buildings and structures in Alsergrund Category:Buildings and structures in Hietzing Category:Buildings and structures in Innere Stadt Category:Buildings and structures in Leopoldstadt Category:Buildings and structures in Mariahilf Category:Buildings and structures in Meidling Category:Buildings and structures in Wieden Category:History museums in Austria Category:Historic house museums in Austria Category:Horological museums Category:Museums in Vienna Category:City museums Category:Museums of ancient Rome in Austria ","title":"Vienna Museum"},{"id":"30630507","text":"The Eckle Round Barn is a historic building that was located near Shelby in rural Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States.

In 1894 he earned his medical degree from the University of Innsbruck, becoming an assistant at the University of Graz during the following year. In 1899 he received his habilitation for psychiatry and neuropathology, and from 1909 to 1926 was an associate professor at Graz. His name is associated with Zingerle's automatosis (Zingerle syndrome), a condition in which an individual experiences visual hallucinations taking place during automatic movements and changes in posture. The term \\"Zingerle syndrome\\" was named in his honor by Swiss neurologist Georges de Morsier (1894‚Äì1982).

D ","title":"List of painters by name beginning with &quot;D&quot;"},{"id":"30630597","text":"Let X be a set of possible \`states of the world' or \`alternatives'; society wishes to choose some state from X. Let I be a finite set, representing a collection of people. For each i \\\\in I, let u_i:X\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbb{R} be a utility function. A social choice rule (or voting system) is a mechanism which uses the data (u_i)_{i \\\\in I} to select some element(s) from X which are \`best' for society. (The basic problem of social choice theory is to disambiguate the word \`best'.) The classic utilitarian social choice rule selects the element x \\\\in X which maximizes the utilitarian sum U(x):= \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} u_i(x). However, for this formula to make sense, we must assume that the utility functions (u_i)_{i \\\\in I} are both cardinal, and interpersonally comparable at a cardinal level. The notion that individuals have cardinal utility functions is not that problematic. Cardinal utility has been implicitly assumed in decision theory ever since Daniel Bernoulli's analysis of the Saint Petersburg Paradox. Rigorous mathematical theories of cardinal utility (with application to risky decision making) were developed by Frank P. Ramsey, Bruno de Finetti, von Neumann and Morgenstern, and Leonard Savage. However, in these theories, a person's utility function is only well- defined up to an \`affine rescaling'. Thus, if the utility function u_i:X\\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} is valid description of her preferences, and if r_i,s_i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} are two constants with s_i>0, then the \`rescaled' utility function v_i(x) := s_i\\\\, u_i(x) + r_i is an equally valid description of her preferences. If we define a new package of utility functions (v_i)_{i\\\\in I} using possibly different r_i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and s_i>0 for all i \\\\in I, and we then consider the utilitarian sum V(x):= \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} v_i(x), then in general, the maximizer of V will not be the same as the maximizer of U. Thus, in a sense, classic utilitarian social choice is not well-defined within the standard model of cardinal utility used in decision theory, unless we specify some mechanism to \`calibrate' the utility functions of the different individuals. Relative utilitarianism proposes a natural calibration mechanism. For every i \\\\in I , suppose that the values m_i \\\\ := \\\\ \\\\min_{x \\\\in X} \\\\, u_i(x) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{and}\\\\quad M_i \\\\ := \\\\ \\\\max_{x \\\\in X} \\\\, u_i(x) are well-defined. (For example, this will always be true if X is finite, or if X is a compact space and u_i is a continuous function.) Then define w_i(x) \\\\ := \\\\ \\\\frac{u_i(x) - m_i}{M_i - m_i} for all x\\\\in X. Thus, w_i:X \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} is a \`rescaled' utility function which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. The Relative Utilitarian social choice rule selects the element in X which maximizes the utilitarian sum W(x):= \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} w_i(x). As an abstract social choice function, relative utilitarianism has been analyzed by Cao (1982), Dhillon (1998), Karni (1998), Dhillon and Mertens (1999), Segal (2000), Sobel (2001) and Pivato (2008). (Cao (1982) refers to it as the \`modified Thomson solution'.) When interpreted as a \`voting rule', it is equivalent to Range voting.

It is located in the middle of the place earlier known as Koladvipa. The Math has been continuing as a famous religious spot thronged by thousands of devotees every year. History In 1940,Bryant&Ekstrand;, 2004. p. 118-122 after jagad-guru Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada entered aprakata-lila, one of his intimate associates, Srila Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja, established Sri Gaudiya Vedanta Samiti (GVS)Bryant&Ekstrand;, 2004.p 76-80 in a rented building. He later purchased an extensive piece of land on which he established a matha with a beautiful temple. Inside the Temple The following deities preside in the five chambers of the temple and samadhi mandir respectively: Temple * Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada, * Sri Gauranga and Sri Radha-Vinoda-bihari, and * Sri Koladeva, or Varahadeva, the presiding deity of Sri Koladvipa. Samadhi * Srila Bhakti Prajnana Kesava Gosvami Maharaja * Srila Bhaktivedanta Vamana Gosvami Maharaja Nava-vidha Bhakti The Brahma Madhya Gaudiya Tilaka, a mark usually worn by the Gaudiya Vaishnavas on forehead. The temple's nine towers each represent one limb of nava-vidha-bhakti, the nine types of devotional service. * Hearing, * Chanting, * Remembering, * Serving the Lord's lotus feet, * Worshipping, * Offering prayers, * Engaging as a servant, * Serving as a friend, and * Completely surrendering oneself. Nava-vidha Khandas The deities of the Mandir - Gauranga and Sri Radha-Vinoda-bihari, Nabadwip, West Bengal The matha is divided into the following nine parts (khandas): * Paramartha-khanda - the printing press where devotional literature and magazines are produced. * Kirtana-khanda - the place where sankirtana, lectures on Bhagavatam and other scriptures take place. * Upasya-khanda - the temple where the deities of Srila Sarasvati Thakura Prabhupada, Sri Gauranga, Sri Radha-Vinona-bihari and Sri Koladeva are worshipped. * Sevaka-khanda - the place where the residents of the matha live. * Bhoga-khanda - the storehouse and kitchen. * Govardhana-khanda - the cow shed. * Vaisnnava-granthagara- khanda - the library. * Udayana-Khanda - the garden. * Jnana-khanda - the bathrooms and latrines. These sections are divided on the basis of activities favourable to bhakti, which are to be accepted and those unfavourable which are to be avoided. Jnana and karma which are devoid of bhakti are always to be rejected just as one rejects stools. For this reason the bathrooms and latrines of the matha are called Jnana-khanda. It was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami's long-held desire that a deity of Sri Koladeva be established on the Ganga's western bank in the old Kuliya-nagara. To fulfill this desire, Srila Bhakti Prajnana kesava Gosvami Maharaja has manifested the service of Sri Koladeva at the place.

The learning needs of 1000 and 2000 level undergraduate courses are intended to be supported with the wide variety of books and magazines. The library also contains the DeRoy Extended Study Center providing 24-hour access to 140 standard workstations as well as 30 high-end work stations with specialized software. Also, approximately 8000 videos, DVDs, laser discs and audiotapes are in the media collection. The Undergraduate Library also provides students with information on careers, computers, and student survival skills. In the Association of Research Libraries, Wayne State University libraries rank among the top 60 libraries.  Location  David Adamany Undergraduate Library is located at 5150 Anthony Wayne in Detroit, Michigan. Within the Wayne State University campus, it is situated at the center of Gullen Mall. Within Detroit, UGL is located within a couple miles from the three major freeways that run through the city; I-75, I-94 and the Lodge (M-10).  History  David Adamany faced a lot of adversity when he first came up with the idea of an undergraduate library in 1982. Adamany looked at the libraries that existed at Wayne State. Not only did he see a need for additional space and further collection development, he saw an opportunity. A library just for undergrads was a new concept. Adamany and library administration persevered through the years and worked to make the undergraduate library a reality. Over ten years after the idea was introduced in May 1986, ground was broken on February 2, 1996, in front of a substantial crowd in sub-zero degree temperatures. From there, things moved quickly. Construction took less than two years and staff worked hard to prepare for the September 1997 opening of the UGL with an interior size of 300.000 square feet  Art at Adamany  The Wayne State University Art Collection, which has grown to include nearly 6000 works of art, has proved a primary resource for creating such an environment. There are decorations and paintings on the walls within the UGL which embrace and enhance the everyday lives of people. The art at Adamany reinforces Wayne State University‚Äôs and Detroit's standing as a center for artistic expression.  Within the UGL  = First floor = Academic advising * Information Desk * Advising Office *:Advising office counsels students academically on how to succeed in their classes as well as aid them in their career development. Students can also learn more about study abroad programs and the office is responsible for providing reasonable accommodations for those persons with disabilities on campus. Professional learning specialists are available to aid students in academic success. Four types of tutoring are available at the Academic Success Center: (1) Students may apply to meet one hour weekly with a student expert, to assist them with work in a particular course; (2) Drop-in tutoring is available at the Center in specific courses; (3) On-line tutoring is available in specific courses, (4) Supplemental Instruction (SI) is available in many first-year introductory courses, in which SI leaders collaborate with the course instructor. These student experts attend each lecture, organize and facilitate group study sessions following the lecture (one to three hours per week), and direct students toward academic success. * Helen L. DeRoy Extended Hours Study Center *:The center provides 24-hour study area with computer workstations, printers, scanners, study tables, and help desk support. The computer support center is also located within this section of the library. Staff at the center help students who are experiencing problems with their Wayne State email address, blackboard program, pipeline, computer applications, and other technologies. * Bernath Auditorium * Online Catalog * Staff Lounge * Student Lounge * Media Equipment Desk * Book Check-Out Desk * Delilah's Cafe = Second floor = Irvin D.

Throughout his chiefship, Wabbicommicot had about 150 warriors under his control.Schmalz, 281 Biography Although it is not known when Wabbicommicot was born, his name first appears on some British documents detailing a meeting between him and Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, the British superintendent of northern Indians at Fort Niagara in July 1761. Rumours had spread that a number of key Seneca figures had been attempting to provoke rebellion against the British among western tribes, so Sir Johnson had been travelling to Detroit for an initial meeting with those tribes allied with the French. Wabbicommicot accompanied Johnson on this trip and thanked Johnson for bringing peace to \\"our Country which was in a treamor\\". However, no amount of negotiation on the part of Johnson could make up for years of the British policy of severing the Indians' supply of rum and ammunition. During the winter of 1762‚Äì3, Wabbicommicot reported to a Toronto-based trader that the First Nations in the region had been put on alert that a French contingent would be arriving shortly to retake the area, and that war would break out between the Indians and the British in spring. Wabbicommicot insisted that he was against a plan such as this, but said that he could not warn his people against it.Schmalz, 71 In May 1763, Wabbicommicot arrived at Fort Niagara to demand rum for his people, warning that he would not be able to guarantee friendly outcomes should his demand be refused.Schmalz, 72 Despite Wabbicommicot's alliance with the British, the personnel at Fort Niagara soon received word that some traders were attacked by Mississaugas at the mouth of the Grand River. In October 1763, Wabbicommicot travelled to Detroit to make a peace offering to the commandant there. He claimed that not only his own tribe but also the Ottawas and the Ojibwas wanted peace in the region. This statement was given weight by the Ojibwa's subsequent release of six prisoners as proof that they wanted to end the war.Schmalz, 75 By 1764, the fighting had ceased, and in September Wabbicommicot was present at the signing of a major treaty in Detroit. In the following years, Wabbicommicot continued his friendship with Johnson at Fort Niagara, feeding him news on occasion. In 1767, Wabbicommicot was asked by the British to put an end to the illicit trading occurring at Toronto. In August 1768, Mississaugas appeared at Fort Niagara and informed Johnson of Wabbicommicot's death.

Not much is known of his life beyond the fact that his name was Greek (from the Greek words eu, \\"well,\\" and prepein, \\"adapted, suited\\"), which is considered evidence of the antiquity of the Veronese see. According to the local tradition of Verona, he was one of the Seventy Disciples mentioned in the Gospel of Luke , but this is \\"entirely unsubstantiated.\\"Matthew Bunson, Margaret Bunson, Stephen Bunson, Our Sunday Visitor's encyclopedia of saints (Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2003), 297. and his name does not appear among the seventy in the 2nd-century list compiled by Hippolytus of Rome. Local tradition states that Euprepius was bishop of Verona from 60 to 72 AD.Henry Wace, A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines (John Murray, 1880), 298. Euprepius' death may have occurred at the end of the 1st century or beginning of the 2nd century. The 9th century Versus de Verona of Anno, Bishop of Verona, which discusses the period in which Verona was converted from paganism to Christianity, states: Primum Verona predicavit Puprepis episcopus (v. 40). This work, also known as the Carmen Pipinianum, includes a description of Verona and its churches, and gives a list of the first eight bishops: Euprepius, Dimidrianus (Demetrianus), Simplicius, Proculus, Saturninus, Lucilius (Lucillus, Lucius), Gricinus (Cricinus), and Zeno.Knights of Columbus. Catholic Truth Committee, The Catholic Encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic Church, Volume 15 (Encyclopedia Press, 1913), 361. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"the period of St. Euprepius, and therefore of the erection of the see, must be placed not before the peace given to the Church under Gallienus (260), but rather under the first period of the reign of Diocletian, when the Church enjoyed peace.\\" The reconstruction of the chronology of bishops from the altar cover from San Firmo e Rustico in Verona known as the Velo di Classe (which dates from the end of the 8th century or beginning of the 9th), places Euprepius first in the list of bishops of Verona. His feast day in the Martyrologium Romanum is 21 August. Veneration Euprepius‚Äô cult did not gain much popularity until the 14th century. In 1492, his relics, along with those of other Veronese bishop saints, were rediscovered in the pieve of San Procolo. The relics were translated to the ancient basilica of San Zeno in 1806, where an inscription on the altar reads: Euprepio Veronae a Christi ann. LXXII praesuli primo. In the 16th century, Domenico Riccio (Domenico Brusasorci) painted a series of portraits of the bishops of Verona, ranging from Euprepius to one of Cardinal Agostino Valerio for the Palazzo del Vescovado di Verona.Francis Palgrave, Hand-book for travellers in northern Italy (J. Murray, 1860), 275. Francis Turner Palgrave remarked in the 19th century that \\"of course the greater number are imaginary, and therefore as uninteresting as possible; but the artist has given his subjects expression and variety.\\" In 1961 the Sacred Congregation of Rites, in accordance with a proposal of the bishop of Verona, Giuseppe Carraro, joined the bishop saints of Verona under a single feast day (October 30), although Euprepius' separate feast day (August 21) was conserved due to the fact that he was the city's first bishop.

Bias electrode(s) focus the resulting electrons toward the collector electrode, where they cause changes in the standing current which are quantified as the detector output. Electron capture mode In the electron capture mode, the PDD is a selective detector for monitoring high electron affinity compounds such as freons, chlorinated pesticides, and other halogen compounds. For this type of compound, the minimum detectable quantity (MDQ) is at the femtogram (10^{-15}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{g}) or picogram (10^{-12}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{g}) level. The PDD is similar in sensitivity and response characteristics to a conventional radioactive ECD, and can be operated at temperatures up to 400¬∞C. For operation in this mode, He and CH4 are introduced just upstream from the column exit. Helium photoionization mode In the helium photoionization mode, the PDD is a universal, non-destructive, high sensitivity detector. The response to both inorganic and organic compounds is linear over a wide range. Response to fixed gases is positive (increase in standing current), with an MDQ in the low ppb range. The PDD in helium photoionization mode is an excellent replacement for flame ionization detectors in petrochemical or refinery environments, where the flame and use of hydrogen can be problematic. In addition, when the helium discharge gas is doped with a suitable noble gas, such as argon, krypton, or xenon (depending on the desired cutoff point), the PDD can function as a specific photoionization detector for selective determination of aliphatics, aromatics, amines, as well as other species.

Dating from the 6th century, it exists as a single manuscript that was discovered in the 'Library Cave' of the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, China by Aurel Stein in 1907, and which is now in the collection of the British Library in London, England.  The British Library manuscript  The manuscript (Or.8210/S.5574) is a paper scroll 15.5 cm high and 240 cm long. The hand-written text comprises 159 lines of about 15‚Äì17 characters per line. The handwriting is cursive, and in places untidy and hard to read, with many obvious transcription errors. The manuscript is incomplete, with probably three to five lines of text (45‚Äì75 characters) missing at the beginning. The end of the manuscript is intact, and gives the title of the text as Qi Jing (Á¢ÅÁ∂ì) \\"Classic of Go\\", and notes that it is complete in one scroll. Unfortunately the name of the author, which would probably have been given at the start of the text, is not provided. The manuscripts in the Dunhuang library cave date from the 5th century up to the early 11th century, when the cave was sealed. Lionel Giles (1875‚Äì1958), the first scholar to recognise the contents of this manuscript, dates the manuscript to the late Tang Dynasty, about 900 AD. However, it is believed that the text of the manual was composed during the late 6th century under the Northern Zhou dynasty (557‚Äì581). The main evidence for this is the fact that the author of the text refers to the black pieces as \\"crow pieces\\" (ÁÉèÂ≠ê) rather than \\"black pieces\\" (ÈªëÂ≠ê). The explanation for this unusual term is that Yuwen Tai (507‚Äì556), father of the first emperor of the Northern Zhou, and posthumously honoured as the founding emperor of the dynasty, had the nickname 'Black Otter' (ÈªëÁç∫), and therefore the character 'black' () was tabooed in documents written during the Northern Zhou dynasty, being replaced by the word 'crow' () which is a synonym for 'black' in Chinese. At the end of the manuscript is a single line of Tibetan reading ban de sba'i 'dris 'o, which has been interpreted as meaning \\"Written by the monk Ba\\". It is uncertain whether this means that the Chinese text was copied out by a Tibetan scribe, or whether a Tibetan monk added the line to the manuscript at a later date.  Contents  Mural illustrating the Vimalakirti Sutra dating to the Five Dynasties period (907‚Äì979) from Cave 32 at the Yulin Caves in Gansu, showing a game of Go being played. There is a similar mural at Dunhuang Cave 454. The main text is divided into seven numbered sections. The number and title of the first section is missing, but it discusses general principles of attack and defence, suggesting that the player emulate famous military strategists such as Chen Ping and Zhuge Liang. It gives general advice such as \\"If greedy, one will often be defeated. If timid, one will rarely succeed\\" (Ë≤™ÂâáÂ§öÊïóÔºåÊÄØÂâáÂ∞ëÂäü). The second section (Ë™òÂæÅÁ¨¨‰∫å) explains the ladder strategy. The third section (Âã¢Áî®ÁØáÁ¨¨‰∏â) discusses good and bad shapes of groups of stones, and gives examples of live and dead shapes, for example noting that \\"bent four in the corner is dead at the end of the game\\" (ËßíÂÇçÊõ≤ÂõõÔºåÂ±ÄÁ´ü‰πÉ‰∫°). The fourth section (ÂÉèÂêçÂºüÂõõ) discusses the symbolism of the Go board and the symbolic names given to different positions on the board. For example, the author states that \\"Go stones are round in imitation of the heavens, and the Go board is square in the same way that the earth is; that there are 361 intersections on the board reflects the division of the ecliptic [into 365 days]\\" (Á¢ÅÂ≠êÂúì‰ª•Ê≥ïÂ§©ÔºåÁ¢ÅÂ±ÄÊñπ‰ª•È°ûÂú∞„ÄÇÁ¢ÅÊúâ‰∏âÁôæÂÖ≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÈÅìÔºåÂÄ£Âë®Â§©‰πãÈÅìÊï∏). The explicit mention here that a Go board has 361 points indicates that the author of the manual was familiar with the standard board with a 19 √ó 19 grid, and not the earlier 17 √ó 17 grid board that is attested in archaeological evidence dating back to the late Han Dynasty (206 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE) and from paintings dating up to the mid 8th century. The fifth section (ÈáãÂúñÂã¢ÁØáÂºü‰∫î) discusses the importance of Go diagrams to mastering the game. It does not give any concrete examples of Go diagrams, but Cheng Enyuan (1917‚Äì1989) suggests that the original text of the manual would have included a set of accompanying diagrams illustrating game positions and strategy. The sixth section (Á¢ÅÂà∂ÁØáÂºüÂÖ≠) discusses rules of behaviour when playing Go, for instance noting that \\"when a stone has been played it may not be moved again\\" (‰∏ãÂ≠ê‰πãÊ≥ïÔºå‰∏çË®±ÂÜçÁßª). Cheng Enyuan notes that this section is very hard to understand as it uses some obscure technical terms and mentions some obsolete practices that are not found in modern Go. In particular it refers several times to the use of counting rods (), but their exact role in the game is uncertain. The seventh section (ÈÉ®Ë¢†ÁØáÂºü‰∏É) discusses the classification of Go diagrams into four categories: famous games; cunning techniques; Ko fights and seki; and life and death shapes. It mentions \\"13 diagrams of Han Dynasty Go games\\" and \\"24 diagrams of Eastern Wu Go games\\", which suggest that there was once a collection of early Go games, which the only surviving example of is a diagram of a game reputedly played between Sun Ce (175‚Äì200) and L√º Fan (died 228). Following the main text is an unnumbered section oddly titled \\"Techniques of Go Faults\\" (Á¢ÅÁóÖÊ≥ï), which appears to be a previously unknown text that the scribe added after the main text. Cheng Enyuan suggests that this section actually comprises two separate extracts from two different Go texts, the first which should be titled \\"Go Faults\\" (Á¢ÅÁóÖ) and the second which should be titled \\"Go Techniques\\" (Á¢ÅÊ≥ï). The \\"Go Faults\\" part discusses three bad faults of Go-playing (sticking too close to the edge and corners; clumsily responding to an opponent's moves; and allowing groups to be cut off from each other) and two careless types of play (playing a stone hurriedly and without thought; and trying to save a dead group), as well as two ways of staying alive (moving out to the centre; and connecting in all directions) and two good habits (not being greedy in a weak position; and not being timid in a strong position). Cheng believes that the following \\"Go Techniques\\" part, which is written in a different style and is a more rounded discussion of Go strategy, may be an extract from a Go treatise by Emperor Wu of Liang (464‚Äì549) who is recorded to have written several works on Go. Appended after this is a short text (16 lines) entitled Essential Commentary on Go (), ascribed to Emperor Wu of Liang, which gives some general strategic advice on playing the game. Although Emperor Wu's Commentary on Go is mentioned in bibliographies from the Tang Dynasty through to the Ming Dynasty, no extant editions of the text are known, and so the brief extract at the end of the Dunhuang manuscript is all that remains of this early Go treatise.  Controversy  In September 2013, Wang Runan, the vice-chairman of the Chinese Weiqi Association, called for the Dunhuang Go Manual to be returned to China.

The committee explored whether or not certain drugs should be considered addictive or habit-forming; examined whether there was a medical need to provide special, including institutional, treatment outside the resources already available, for persons addicted to drugs; and made recommendations, including proposals for administrative measures, to the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The committee produced two reports.  The First Brain Report  The first report is also known as The Report of the Second Inter-departmental Committee on Drug Addiction, and it was published in 1961. It stated that the incidence of addiction to dangerous drugs in Great Britain was small.http://www.drugtext.org/First-Brain-Report/drug-addiction-1.html This was the same conclusion drawn by the previous committee, The Rolleston Committee, in 1926.http://www.drugtext.org/Table/Rolleston-Report/  The Second Brain Report  The second report was published in 1964.http://www.the- shipman-inquiry.org.uk/4r_page.asp?id=3114 This report showed that there had been a significant rise in the incidence of addiction to heroin and cocaine, and that the main source of supply was a small number of over-prescribing doctors. The Rolleston defined addiction as an individualised pathology, whilst the second Brain report explicitly described the condition as a socially infectious one.by Rachel Lart, CHANGING IMAGES OF THE ADDICT AND ADDICTION, BRITISH MEDICAL PERCEPTION FROM ROLLESTON TO BRAIN It recommended the establishment of special treatment centres, especially in the London area, where addicts could be isolated from the community and treated. These became known as Drug Dependency Units or DDUs.  Evolution  A recommendation of the second committee was to set up a Standing Advisory Committee to keep under review the whole problem of drug dependence. This drew on evidence provided by doctors, and eventually they produced a report, the Wootton Report.

The study of education equity is often linked with the study of excellence and equity. Educational equity depends on two main factors. The first is fairness, which implies that factors specific to one's personal conditions should not interfere with the potential of academic success. The second important factor is inclusion, which refers to a comprehensive standard that applies to everyone in a certain education system. These two factors are closely related and depend on each other for an educational system's success. Especially, equal rights for both genders. This is one of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 in recognition of the importance of education equity. The growing importance of education equity is based on the premise that an individual's level of education directly correlates to future quality of life. Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving. However, inequity in education is challenging to avoid, and can be broken down into inequity due to socioeconomic standing, race, gender or disability. Educational equity is also based in the historical context of the location, people and structure. History shapes the outcome of individuals within the education system. Equity vs. equality Often, the terms \\"equity\\" and \\"equality\\" are interchanged when referring to educational equity. Although similar, there can be important distinctions between the two. = Equity = Equity recognizes that some are at a larger disadvantage than others and aims at compensating for these peoples misfortunes and disabilities to ensure that everyone can attain the same type of healthy lifestyle. Examples of this are: ‚ÄúWhen libraries offer literacy programs, when schools offer courses in English as a second language, and when foundations target scholarships to students from poor families, they operationalize a belief in equity of access as fairness and as justice‚Äù. Equity recognizes this uneven playing field and aims to take extra measures by giving those who are in need more than others who are not. Equity aims at making sure that everyone's lifestyle is equal even if it may come at the cost of unequal distribution of access and goods. Social justice leaders in education strive to ensure equitable outcomes for their students. = Equality = The American Library Association defines equality as: ‚Äúaccess to channels of communication and sources of information that is made available on even terms to all--a level playing field--is derived from the concept of fairness as uniform distribution, where everyone is entitled to the same level of access and can avail themselves if they so choose.‚Äù In this definition of equality no one person has an unfair advantage. Everyone is given equal opportunities and accessibility and are then free to do what they please with it. However, this is not to say that everyone is then inherently equal. Some people may choose to seize these open and equal opportunities while others let them pass by.  Educational Tracking  = Tracking and Equity = Tracking systems, are selective measures to locate students in different educational levels. They are created to increase the efficiency of education. It allows to make more or less homogeneous groups of students to perceive education that suits their educational skills. However, tracking can affect educational equity if the selection process is biased and children with a certain background are structurally located to lower tracks. The effects of tracking are that students are both viewed and treated differently depending on which track they take. It can generate unequal achievement levels between individual students and it can restrict access to higher tracks and higher education. The quality of teaching and curricula vary between tracks and as a result, those of the lower track are disadvantaged with inferior resources, teachers, etc. In many cases, tracking stunts students who may develop the ability to excel past their original placement. = Tracking systems = The type of tracking has impact on the level of educational equity, which is especially determined by the degree in which the system is differentiated. Less differentiated systems, such as standardized comprehensive schools, reach higher levels of equity in comparison to more differentiated, or tracked, systems. Within the tracked systems, the kind of differentiation matters as well for educational equity. Differentiation of schools could be organized externally or internally. External differentiation means that tracks are separated in different schools. Certain schools follow a certain track, which prepares students for academic or professional education, or for career or vocational education. This form is less beneficial for educational equity than internal differentiation or course-by-course tracking. Internal tracking means that, within a single school, courses are instructed at different levels, which is a less rigid kind of tracking that allows for more mobility. The organization of the tracking systems themselves is also important for its effect on educational equity. For both differentiation systems, a higher number of tracks and a smaller number of students per track is granting more educational equity. In addition, the effects of tracking are less rigid and have a smaller impact on equity if the students are located in tracks when they are older. The earlier the students undergo educational selection, the less mobile they are to develop their abilities and the less they can benefit from peer effects. Socio-economic equity in education Education equality on countries that are members of the OECD. The numbers correspond to the average difference of points in the results of the PISA test of a student from a high socio-economic level and a student from a low socio-economic level in their respective country. A higher number represents a more unequal education system whilst a smaller number indicates a more equal education system =Income and class= Educational scores are higher in rich countries with less economic inequality Income has always played an important role in shaping academic success. Those who come from a family of a higher socioeconomic status (SES) are privileged with more opportunities than those of lower SES. Those who come from a higher SES can afford things like better tutors, rigorous SAT/ACT prep classes, impressive summer programs, and so on. Parents generally feel more comfortable intervening on behalf of their children to acquire better grades or more qualified teachers (Levitsky). Parents of a higher SES are more willing to donate large sums of money to a certain institution to better improve their child's chances of acceptance, along with other extravagant measures. This creates an unfair advantage and distinct class barrier. =Costs of education= The extraordinarily high cost of the many prestigious high schools and universities in the United States makes an attempt at a \\"level playing field\\" for all students not so level. High-achieving low-income students do not have the means to attend selective schools that better prepare a student for later success. Because of this, low-income students do not even attempt to apply to the top-tier schools for which they are more than qualified. In addition, neighborhoods generally segregated by class leave lower-income students in lower-quality schools. For higher-quality schooling, students in low-income areas would have to take public transport which they can't pay for. Fewer than 30 percent of students in the bottom quarter of incomes even enroll in a four-year school and among that group, fewer than half graduate. Racial equity in education From a scientific point of view, the human species is a single species. Nevertheless, the term racial group is enshrined in legislation, and phrases such as race equality and race relations are in widespread official use. Racial equity in education means the assignment of students to public schools and within schools without regard to their race. This includes providing students with a full opportunity for participation in all educational programs regardless of their race. The educational system and its response to racial concerns in education vary from country to country. Below are some examples of countries that have to deal with racial discrimination in education. * US Department of Education: The Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues a seminal report in 2013. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American public schools once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality. The struggle for equality of access to formal education and equality of excellent educational outcomes is part of the history of education in this country and is tied up with the economic, political, social history of the peoples who are part of it. From the beginning of this nation, there were many barriers to the schooling and education of girls and racial, national origin, and language groups not from the dominant culture. Approaches and resources for achieving equality and equity in the public schooling of girls and ethnic, racial, and language minority groups are still evolving. * Asia-Pacific Region: Globalization of the economy, increasingly diverse and interconnected populations, and rapid technological change are posing new and demanding challenges to individuals and societies alike. School systems are rethinking the knowledge and skills students need for success, and the educational strategies and systems required for all children to achieve them. Within the Asia-Pacific region, for example, Korea, Shanghai-China, and Japan are examples of Asian education systems that have climbed the ladder to the top in both quality and equity indicators. * South Africa: A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. During the apartheid era, which began when the National Party won control of Parliament in 1948 and ended with a negotiated settlement more than four decades later, the provision of education was racially unequal by design. Resources were lavished on schools serving white students while schools serving the black majority were systematically deprived of qualified teachers, physical resources and teaching aids such as textbook and stationery. The rationale for such inequity was a matter of public record. Students wanting to be more involved in the community. Not feeling left out, which I think is a good feeling being that race was a big problem. They gave them transportation to get to the meetings and back to where they were going after. = Higher education = Higher education plays a vital role in preparing students for the employment market and active citizenship both nationally and internationally. By embedding race equality in teaching and learning, institutions can ensure that they acknowledge the experiences and values of all students, including minority ethnic and international students. Universities Scotland first published the Race Equality Toolkit: learning and teaching in 2006 in response to strong demand from the universities in Scotland for guidance on meeting their statutory obligations. Gender equity in education Gender equity in practicality refers to both male and female concerns, yet most of the gender bias is against women in the developing world. Gender discrimination in education has been very evident and underlying problem in many countries, especially in developing countries where cultural and societal stigma continue to hinder growth and prosperity for women. Global Campaign for Education (GCE) followed a survey called \\"Gender Discrimination in Violation of Rights of Women and Girls\\" states that one tenth of girls in primary school are 'unhappy' and this number increases to one fifth by the time they reach secondary schools. Some of the reasonings that girls provided include harassment, restorations to freedom, and an inherent lack of opportunities, compared to boys. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) understands Education as a \\" fundamental human right and essential for the exercise of all other human rights. It promotes individual freedom and empowerment and yields important development benefits.\\" UN Special Rapporteur Katarina Tomasevki developed the '4A' framework on the Right to Education. The '4A' framework encompasses availability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability as fundamental to the institution of education. And yet girls in many underdeveloped countries are denied secondary education. Figure on the right shows the discrepancies in secondary education in the world. Countries such as Sudan, Somalia, Thailand and Afghanistan face the highest of inequity when it comes to gender bias. Gender-based inequity in education is not just a phenomenon in developing countries. A New York Times article highlighted how education systems, especially the public school system, tend to cause segregation between genders. Boys and girls are often taught with different approaches, which programs children to think they are different and deserve different treatment. However, studies show that boys and girls learn differently, and therefore should be taught differently. Boys learn better when they keep moving, while girls learn better sitting in one place with silence. Therefore‚Äîin this reasoning‚Äîsegregating the genders promotes gender equity in education, as both boys and girls have optimized learning. =Causes of gender discrimination in education= VSO is a leading independent international development organization that works towards eliminating poverty and one of the problems they tackle is gender inequity in education. VSO published a paper that categorizes the obstacles (or causes) into: * Community Level Obstacles: This category primarily relates to the bias displayed for education external to the school environment. This includes restraints due to poverty and child labour, socio-economic constraints, lack of parental involvement and community participation. Harmful practices like child marriage and predetermined gender roles are cultural hindrances. * School and Education System Level Obstacles: Lack of investment in quality education, inappropriate attitudes and behaviors, lack of female teachers as role models and lack of gender-friendly school environment are all factors that promote gender inequity in education. =Impact of gender discrimination on the economy= Education is universally acknowledged as an essential human right because it highly impacts the socio-economic and cultural aspects of a country. Equity in education increases the work force of the nation, therefore increasing national income, economic productivity, and [gross domestic product]. It reduces fertility and infant mortality, improves child health, increases life expectancy and increases standards of living. These are factors that allow economic stability and growth in the future. Above all, female education can increase output levels and allow countries to attain sustainable development. Equity in education of women also reduces the possibilities of trafficking and exploitation of women. UNESCO also refers gender equity as a major factor that allows for sustainable development. https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/gender-inequality is an article published by The Economist, which says: \\"Looking at recently-published UN statistics on gender inequality in education, one observes that the overall picture has improved dramatically over the last decade, but progress has not been even (see chart). Although the developing world on average looks likely to hit the UN‚Äôs gender-inequality target, many parts of Africa are lagging behind. While progress is being made in sub-Saharan Africa in primary education, gender inequality is in fact widening among older children. The ratio of girls enrolled in primary school rose from 85 to 93 per 100 boys between 1999 and 2010, whereas it fell from 83 to 82 and from 67 to 63 at the secondary and tertiary levels.\\"  Reputable research centers and associations  *University of Pennsylvania: The Center for the Study of Race and Equity in Education unites University of Pennsylvania scholars who do research on race, racism, racial climates, and important topics pertaining to equity in education. Center staff and affiliates collaborate on funded research projects, environmental assessment activities, and the production of research reports. Principally, the Center aims to publish cutting-edge implications for education policy and practice, with an explicit focus on improving equity in schools, colleges and universities, and social contexts that influence educational outcomes.Mission and Purpose  Center for the Study of Race & Equity in Education *Programs for Educational Opportunity, University of Michigan: 'Equity in Elementary and Secondary Education: Race, Gender, and National Origin Issues' is a site composed of article reviews and final papers from students enrolled in an courses at the University of Michigan School of Education focusing on equity and social justice issues in education starting the Fall of 2007. What follows is a work in progress, started by members of a class entitled \\"Equity in K‚Äì12 Public Education\\" held the Fall of 2007 and \\"Equity and Social Justice in Education: Race, Gender, National Origin, and Language Minority Issues in Schools\\" the Fall of 2008 at the University of Michigan School of Education. The site has timelines, reviews of articles on selected issues, and additional resources. *Equity and Quality in Education (Asia Society): Asia Society is the leading educational organization dedicated to promoting mutual understanding and strengthening partnerships among peoples, leaders and institutions of Asia and the United States in a global context. Across the fields of arts, business, culture, education, and policy, the Society provides insight, generates ideas, and promotes collaboration to address present challenges and create a shared future. The highest performing education systems are those that combine quality with equity. Equity in education means that personal or social circumstances such as gender, ethnic origin or family background, are not obstacles to achieving educational potential (definition of fairness) and that all individuals reach at least a basic minimum level of skills (definition of inclusion). In these education systems, the vast majority of students have the opportunity to attain high- level skills, regardless of their own personal and socio-economic circumstances. *Regional Educational Laboratory Northwest: REL Northwest is part of the Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Program funded by the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences. Education Northwest works to transform teaching and learning by providing resources that help schools, districts, and communities across the country find comprehensive, research-based solutions to the challenges they face. *IDRA South Central Collaborative for Equity: The Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA) is an independent, non-profit organization that is dedicated to assuring educational opportunity for every child. The South Central Collaborative for Equity helps schools become more racially equitable, ensure equal opportunity for academic achievement, provide fair discipline, decrease conflict, and engage parents and community members. *PPS Racial Educational Equity Policy: The Board of Education for Portland Public Schools (PPS) is committed to the success of every student in each of our schools. The mission of Portland Public Schools is that by the end of elementary, middle, and high school, every student by name will meet or exceed academic standards and be fully prepared to make productive life decisions. We believe that every student has the potential to achieve, and it is the responsibility of our school district to give each student the opportunity and support to meet his or her highest potential. *National Centre for Student Equity in Higher Education (NCSEHE): Funded by the Department of Education (Australia) and currently based at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia, the NCSEHE promotes discussion and research of Australian higher education equity policy. The Centre undertakes and informs policy design, implementation, and institutional practice to improve higher education participation and success for marginalised and disadvantaged people in Australia. *Seed the Way: Founded by Rebecca Eun-Mi Haslam, 2015 Vermont teacher of the year. Haslam believes in equity and her company Seed the Way focuses on establishing equity in the classroom.  Notable publications and reports  Providing opportunities for students to consider racial equality as well as matters of racism as part of their study will help them to develop confidence to engage with these concepts as part of future practice, thinking, and life skills. Race, social class, and gender as issues related to schooling have received major attention from educators and social scientists over the last two decades. = Race equality in education - a survey report by England = The local authorities in England gave a survey report Race equality in education in November 2005. This report is based on visits by Her Majesty.s Inspectors (HMIs) and additional inspectors to 12 LEAs and 50 schools in England between summer term 2003 to spring term 2005. This report illustrates good practice on race equality in education in a sample of schools and local education authorities (LEAs) surveyed between the summer of 2003 and the spring of 2005. The survey focused on schools and LEAs that were involved effectively in race equality in education. Four areas were examined by inspectors: improving standards and achievement amongst groups of pupils, with reference to the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 (RRAA); the incorporation of race equality concepts into the curriculum in schools; the handling and reporting of race-related incidents in schools; the work of schools and LEAs in improving links with local minority ethnic communities. = Race equality and education ‚Äì by UK educational system = The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) (ATL promotes and protects the interests of its members ‚Äì teachers, lecturers, support staff and other education professionals) introduced a practical resource for the school workforce Race equality and education in the UK educational system. The publication sets out to examine the racial, religious or cultural terminology regularly used in today's society, in an attempt to combat prejudice based on colour, ethnicity, religion or culture. = The equity and excellence commission - US education = At this decisive moment, the Commission on Equity and Excellence in Education issues this seminal report. It is not a restatement of public education's struggles, nor is it a mere list of recommendations. Rather, this is a declaration of an urgent national mission: to provide equity and excellence in education in American public schools once and for all. This collective wisdom is a historic blueprint for making the dream of equity, and a world-class education, for each and every American child a reality. Carol D. Lee described the rationale for a special theme issue, \\"Reconceptualizing Race and Ethnicity in Educational Research.\\" The rationale includes the historical and contemporary ways that cultural differences have been positioned in educational research and the need for more nuanced and complex analyses of ethnicity and race. = Racial equity in education: how far has South Africa come? = A major task of South Africa's new government in 1994 was to promote racial equity in the state education system. This paper evaluates progress towards this goal using three distinct concepts: equal treatment, equal educational opportunity, and educational adequacy. The authors find that the country has succeeded in establishing racial equity defined as equal treatment, primarily through race- blind policies for allocating state funds for schools. Progress measured by the other two criteria, however, has been constrained by the legacy of apartheid, including poor facilities and lack of human capacity in schools serving black students, and by policies such as school fees. = Race in education: an argument for integrative analysis = Education literature tends to treat race, social class, and gender as separate issues. A review of a sample of education literature from four academic journals, spanning ten years, sought to determine how much these status groups were integrated. The study found little integration. The study then provided a research example on cooperative learning to illustrate how attention to only one status group oversimplifies the analysis of student behavior in school. From findings of studies integrating race and class, and race and gender, the study argues that attending only to race, in this example, oversimplifies behavior analysis and may help perpetuate gender and class biases. To determine to what extent race, social class, and gender are integrated in the education literature, the study examined a sample of literature published over a ten-year period and 30 articles focused primarily on race, or on school issues related directly to race, such as desegregation. = Equity and quality in education: supporting disadvantaged students and schools‚Äìfrom OECD = The report is by the OECD Education Directorate with support from the Asia Society as a background report for the first Asia Society Global Cities Network Symposium, Hong Kong, May 10‚Äì12, 2012. Asia Society is grateful for OECD's leadership in international benchmarking and for our ongoing partnership. Asia Society organized the Global Cities Education Network, a network of urban school systems in North America and Asia to focus on challenges and opportunities for improvement common to them, and to virtually all city education systems. This report presents the key recommendations of the OECD publication Equity and Quality in Education: Supporting Disadvantaged Students and Schools (2012a), which maps out policy levers that can help build high quality and equitable education systems, with a particular focus on North American and Asia-Pacific countries. Challenges in educational equity The long-term social and economic consequences of having little education are more tangible now than ever before. Those without the skills to participate socially and economically in society generate higher costs of healthcare, income support, child welfare and social security. =Societal structure and costs= While both basic education and higher education have both been improved and expanded in the past 50 years, this has not translated to a more equal society in terms of academics. While the feminist movement has made great strides for women, other groups have not been as fortunate. Generally, social mobility has not increased, while economic inequality has. So, while more students are getting a basic education and even attending universities, a dramatic divide is present and many people are still being left behind. =Increase migration and diversity= out of school children as a result of migration and diversity As increased immigration causes problems in educational equity for some countries, poor social cohesion in other countries is also a major issue. In countries where continued migration causes an issue, the ever-changing social structure of different races makes it difficult to propose a long-term solution to educational equity. On the other hand, many countries with consistent levels of diversity experience long-standing issues of integrating minorities. Challenges for minorities and migrants are often exacerbated as these groups statistically struggle more in terms of both lower academic performance and lower socio-economic status.

Smith for the TRS-80 and published in 1980 by Microsoft. In the game, the player competes in ten track and field events. The gold medalist for decathlon in the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics, Bruce Jenner, is a character. It was ported to the Apple II in 1981. The 1982 version for the IBM PC was renamed Microsoft Decathlon. Gameplay The ten events in the game are the 100m run, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400m run, 100m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin, and 1500m run. The running events involve alternately pressing the 1 and 2 keys. Other events have more complex controls, with the pole vault using five different keys. Reception Decathlon received the Creative Computing Game of the Year Award at the 1980 West Coast Computer Faire. BYTE in 1981 called Decathlon \\"a great party game\\" and \\"a remarkable simulation ... challenging and entertaining\\", praising the adherence to the real decathlon's rules and the TRS-80 and Apple II versions' graphics. Computer Gaming World stated in 1982 that Decathlon \\"has all the characteristics that are required of a long-lasting, quality game\\". It described the game as having \\"superb graphics and sound\\", and concluded that \\"it is an important contribution to the computer gaming hobby\\". Former decathlete Douglas Cobb wrote in PC Magazine in 1983 that \\"this impressive, realistic game brings back vivid memories and provides exciting entertainment through all ten events. The jumping and throwing events are particularly authentic, applying theories used in actual competition. Strategies combining speed, timing, and direction are authentic enough to help an Olympic hopeful train on the basic principles behind the individual events\\". In 1984 InfoWorld stated that \\"no one's topped it yet. If I were Microsoft, I'd market the heck out of [Decathlon] this summer.\\" Legacy Olympic Decathlon preceded Konami's Track & Field and The Activision Decathlon, both of which were released in 1983 and have similar gameplay.

Gameplay  In the game, the player participates in a Decathlon.  Reception  The game received unfavorable reviews. A reviewer for Next Generation said, \\"A decathlon simulation is a novel idea, but this implementation simply isn't exciting enough to do the job.\\" GameSpots Hugo Foster made similar remarks, and added that the simplicity of the gameplay makes the results essentially arbitrary once the player has mastered the rudimentary skills involved, which removes any potential excitement from the multiplayer mode: \\"You find yourself begging for results, rather than feeling that you've done something to deserve them.\\" However, he praised the included interview and commentaries from Bruce Jenner.

She is reluctantly taken to see her grandfather Len, now in his eighties, who is in hospital paralysed by a major stroke. Erin hardly knows him, but whilst helping her mother to clear out his flat she finds a diary of his time as a sergeant in the 6th Airborne Division in British Mandate Palestine after the Second World War. Her mother wants her to throw it away, but she surreptitiously keeps it. She decides to take up her best friend Eliza's offer to spend time in Israel, while she undergoes basic training for her compulsory Israeli military service. As they fly out Erin starts to read the diary, and becomes fascinated; it opens with Len describing \\"the worst day of his life so far\\" ‚Äì the horror of liberating Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Thereafter the series intercuts between the two stories as they develop, hers in 2005 and his in the 1940s. Len's unit is posted to Stella Maris base near Haifa, as part of the British Mandate forces keeping the fragile peace between Arabs and the growing Jewish population. Their first job is to round up a group of Jewish refugees coming ashore from a ship, who are taken to a detention centre. The forced showers and captivity behind wire fences remind Len of what he has seen in Germany. Returning to the beach Len finds a straggler, and is about to let her go when they are spotted by a passing patrol. Len is reprimanded; his commander emphasises the danger of Arab insurrection if Jewish immigration is not controlled. At the City Hospitality Club in Haifa, Len's corporal Jackie Clough introduces him to two Jewish girls: Ziphora and Clara. Clara explains that the club's purpose is to generate goodwill for the Jews, and that she is paid to be there. Meanwhile Len leads a search of the kibbutz at Qiryat Haiyim, but finds nothing. He is told that the entire secretariat at Stella Maris is Jewish and leaks are very common. Clara invites him home for tea, where her father tries to get him to talk about Stella Maris. Len's superior Rowntree encourages Len to contact the Jewish underground, suggesting that a crowd at a rally would be a safer place to meet them than Clara's flat. However, when Len is approached, his contact is shot dead by the British forces policing the rally: Len has been set up. Out on armoured patrol a chamberpot is emptied over the soldiers. Then at the base several of Len's men are shot, some in the back while they are hosing down the vehicles, in a raid by Jewish militants. Len goes to see Clara, whose father apologises for what has happened to Len's men, but tells him he is no longer welcome there. Clara however follows Len down the stairs and embraces him. Meanwhile, in 2005 Erin is staying with Eliza's well-to-do family, who drive Mercedes cars and live in Caesarea in a beach-front villa with a pool. Eliza takes Erin shopping and clubbing in Tel Aviv, cut short when Erin's epilepsy is triggered by flashing lights in the club. Erin also meets Eliza's brother Paul, described by Eliza as \\"crazy\\", who has come out of the army transformed into a peace activist. Paul and Eliza's father is a former general who criticised the occupation and is now a leading liberal. Nevertheless he and Paul clash over politics at the dinner table. According to Paul, his father's liberalism merely misleads people into thinking Israel is a normal country like their own; he says the truth is that it is dominated by the military and led by former military leaders. Erin asks Paul to take her to see the grave of one of Len's comrades, who in the diary has just been killed in the raid of the Jewish militants on the base. At the CWGC cemetery she finds the graves of two more names from the diary: Sergeants Robbins and Nash, who at that point in the diary are still alive. Paul takes her through a checkpoint into the Occupied Territories. In Nablus Erin hears him addressing a meeting of Combatants for Peace together with Omar, a former member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. At the end of the meeting, the two shake hands, and Paul drives Omar back towards his home on the Israeli side of the line. They are waved through the checkpoint, but Omar goes back to remonstrate with the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) border guards about a couple being split up, and is detained. Paul condemns the checkpoints as just a way to make Palestinian life difficult, and points to a stretch of the separation barrier where there is a Palestinian village on each side of the wall, arguing that a terrorist might live in either village. They go to a caf√©, but when Paul goes back to retrieve his wallet, the building is blown apart by a suicide bomb. = Part 2 = Len disciplines soldiers who are abusing his company's Palestinian servant. Later at the club, Clough teases him that Clara is seeking a passport from marrying him. Len takes Clara home on the way to a meeting; there is no- one in, so she takes him to bed, asking him to stay longer, but he has to attend a meeting. The meeting, at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, is a briefing on \\"Operation Bulldog\\", the upcoming cordon and search of Tel Aviv.\\"Operation Bulldog\\" as depicted in the series is a composite of two real- life operations: Operation Agatha, a number of targeted actions undertaken just before the King David bombing; and Operation Shark, the cordoning-and- search of Tel Aviv undertaken immediately after the bombing. There is an explosion outside. Some civilians in a neighbouring room come to the balcony, and Len goes to encourage them to move back from the window, but there is a second bigger explosion. When Len regains consciousness, he sees that an entire wing of the building has been destroyed. In 2005 rescue teams arrive to help the wounded from the caf√© explosion. At the hospital Erin walks through rooms of casualties before she finds Paul, just as his father arrives. Paul is alive, but his leg, arm and eye are bandaged. Len digs a dead woman out of the rubble of the King David Hotel. That night, Len rounds on Clara for having known in advance and trying to protect him. Clara protests she was only trying to show that she loved him. At the base, the servant alerts Len that Alec Hyman, one of his men who is Jewish, is being given a \\"regimental bath\\" in retribution‚Äîhe is being viciously scrubbed. Len breaks it up, and later thanks the servant, learning his name: Mohammed. Operation Bulldog gets underway. Len's platoon storms a house where one of the King David bombers had been hiding. But he has already been tipped off and gone. The owners protest that they had been forced to harbour \\"Irgun\\" members, but they are nevertheless taken away, and the British blow up their house. Mesheq Yagur kibbutz is searched, and Len discovers a substantial arms cache hidden in a room below a children's merry-go-round. Returning to base, the soldiers are serenaded by schoolchildren handing out flowers. Rowntree explains that they are anemones, or kalaniot in Hebrew: \\"red for the paratrooper's beret; black for his heart\\". Len gives the bunch to Mohammed, only to be told he has now put Mohammed under an obligation, and Mohammed will be duty-bound to offer him dinner. Subsequently he visits Mohammed and his extended family and has dinner. Afterwards they take a group photograph with Len outside Mohammed's house. Paul's mother complains that the suicide bombers at the caf√© are 'animals'. Paul replies that she should tell Erin about some of the 'animals' who blew up the King David Hotel, including her own father. Erin is on the point of going home, but reads the last page of Len's diary and finds with it, in an envelope, a key. Len writes that he is facing prison, and has let down everyone who ever trusted him, and wishes he could return the key to Mohammed. Haunted by this, and knowing her grandfather has been unhappy all his life, Erin decides to stay and find out more. Looking up Omar's telephone number in Paul's phone, she gets Omar to take her to Ein Hawd, which was the location of Mohammed's house in the diary. But she finds that that village is now Ein Hod, now a Jewish artistic centre. She is told that the Palestinians left in 1948, but some had returned to found a new Ein Hawd in what had been their orchards above the old village. An old man agrees to let them drive him through what was once his village, and eventually they identify what had been Mohammed's house. He thanks Erin for taking him back, even though it had been painful. He is able to give Omar a Hebron address for the family, although when Erin asks Omar to take her, he suggests that Paul might be a better guide, as it was where he had been stationed in the army. Erin and Eliza visit Eliza's grandfather. He is unapologetic, and tells them that his father, mother, sister and brother had all died in German camps. He says that his generation had been determined that the Jewish people would never again capitulate in the face of genocide, and want to secure a land that could be safe for ever. He explains that the British stood in their way, so they wiped them out. Len and Jackie and another soldier are off duty and driving through town in a jeep when they are ambushed. Len reaches for his revolver, but two men with handguns shoot all three soldiers. As Len and Jackie struggle for their lives, they are ignored by onlookers sitting in caf√©s.According to Kosminsky, the sequence at the end of episode 2 was inspired by a December 1947 of an incident when three soldiers were shot. = Part 3 = While in hospital Len shows some compassion to Avram Klein (a Jewish militant who has been shot in the jaw having shot three British policemen),Klein is based in part on Dov Gruner . Gruner was executed on charges of \\"firing on policemen, and setting explosive charges with the intent of killing personnel on His Majesty's service\\". He had not himself actually shot anybody, although others who died at about the same time had. Gruner was hanged three months before the events of the Sergeants Affair; for this purpose in the character of Avram Klein the series has composited Gruner with the perpetrators of the Acre Prison Break. even after a violent attempt to free him. Rowntree asks Len to persuade Klein to appeal to the Privy Council to avoid his otherwise inevitable execution. Len finds Klein in a solitary confinement cell in Acre, but he is unwilling to appeal, saying that every movement needs its martyrs. Meanwhile Len has started giving Mohammed's son Hassan tuition in mathematics. Clara is getting hostile glances from people who think she is fraternising with the enemy. Erin is dropped by taxi at Abu Dis, where Omar lives, which is near the separation wall. He is playing cards on the roof, and non-plussed when Erin says he had agreed to give her a driving lesson. He also tells Erin that he is a Palestinian Christian. In the car Erin admits that she is forbidden to drive because of her epilepsy. Omar drives her back to Caesarea, where Erin tempts him into the house, and then into the pool. They are starting to kiss when Eliza's parents appear. Eliza's father is formally polite; his wife looks very unhappy, and a strained dinner follows. Paul, though warm to Omar, also seems not entirely happy. Eliza's parents start to have a serious talk with Erin, but she is struck by another epileptic fit. When she recovers, Paul comes to see her; she senses that he is upset with her, but he denies it. Arriving at Clara's flat, Len is perturbed to find it open and apparently deserted. Clara is in the bath; much of her hair has been torn out, and she has been daubed with oil and feathers. Len comforts her and stays with her, but later needs to leave for an appointment, but will not be drawn as to what it is. Clara can't believe that he still does not trust her. Len relents and tells her everything, including the name of the spy that he, Robbins and Nash are going to meet. At the meeting they are ambushed; their Jewish informant is led away, and Len and the two Intelligence Corps sergeants are abducted. A purported British Army major apologises to Len that it has been a ruse, to try to determine whether Robbins is a spy. But Len is unconvinced, and he is dragged off to join the others, being held in a hole under a heavy trapdoor, with just enough room for themselves and an oxygen cylinder. Days pass, and Len is again taken to the \\"major\\", who tells Len he was indeed a wartime officer, in the Palestine Jewish Brigade, and had then spirited Jews out of the camps onto boats. He asks Len to join him, but Len is not interested. Days later, Len is dragged out again. Unhooded, and out in the open, he expects to be shot, but finds he has been released. He takes Rowntree back to the factory, but Robbins and Nash are gone. Two miles away, Robbins and Nash are found, dead and hanging from trees.The conditions of the imprisonment of Robbins and Nash, and the display and booby-trapping of their bodies, closely correspond to the fate of Sergeant Clifford Martin and Sergeant Mervyn Paice in what became known as The Sergeants Affair (although the actual communiqu√© attempted to claim that the killings were not a reprisal for the British hangings that day). The dates of death on the gravestones in Episode 1 are those of the real sergeants. A message hung around Robbins's neck says he has been found guilty of \\"murder\\" and executed in reprisal for the \\"illegal killing\\" of Avram Klein. Sappers declare the ground clear, but when a member of the Palestine Police starts to cut down the body, it explodes. Len returns to Clara's flat in fury, but she has gone. Clara's father apologies for his daughter's extreme views. Len confesses everything to Rowntree. Later, talking to Clough, he suffers an epileptic fit. Robbins and Nash are buried with military honours. Erin is shocked to read Len's description of his fit. She shows Paul a press cutting about Robbins and Nash; he remembers it, and says it was what broke the British will to fight. Erin also mentions Len's fit, and says that Len doesn't seem to know what it is. Paul kisses her, and she wakes up the next morning in Paul's bed. From a bus on the way to Hebron she rings Omar and asks if he could meet her there. At a military checkpoint a liberal Israeli guide is explaining to a group that part of the city has been closed off as a \\"sterile zone\\"; he is being barracked by an orthodox settler with a megaphone. Erin slips past the group and into the zone. She meets a group of Palestinian schoolgirls walking home from school. The girls are verbally abused crossing a playground, then stoned by some young Jewish boys, while IDF soldiers stand by and watch.According to Kosminsky, the sequence of the girls being stoned was a \\"direct reconstruction\\" from documentary video footage (e.g. perhaps this video ). Channel 4's lawyers demanded such evidence at script stage before they would allow the scene. (Kosminsky interview for Front Row, BBC Radio 4, 4 February 2011; at 10:40) Erin improvises a bandage for a cut on one of the girls' heads. The group are able to point her to a house that matches her address. At the doorway she is met by a Jewish orthodox woman. Inside she is led to a room where orthodox men are eating. Erin starts to explain her quest, when two IDF soldiers arrive, brought by the daughter, to lead Erin away. Behind her the man furiously rebukes the woman. Outside, she is patted down and bundled into an IDF military vehicle. Erin secretly sends text from her phone while she is driven away. = Part 4 = Erin is about to be questioned at the IDF base when Paul appears, and greets some of his former soldier colleagues. He tells her the army is there to protect the settlers, not to keep the peace. Erin wakes in the night and is almost shot by a sniper bullet. Paul has his ex-comrades throw him a gun, and he shoots into the night, later justifying his actions as loyalty. The next morning, they find a woman who is the grand-daughter of Mohammed's cousin. Settlers drop broken glass onto her yard from what had been her grandfather's house. The orthodox woman from the previous day arrives to taunt her.Compare this video / wider context of similar taunting, from Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem Erin tries to intervene, but Paul leads her away, saying it would make things worse. Paul tells Erin that Mohammed's family is now in Gaza, which is an unreachable war- zone. Back in 1947, a crowd is celebrating the U.N. partition resolution which will create a Jewish state. Searching for the source of the Kol Zion underground broadcasts, Len's men raid some flats; Clough's gun \\"accidentally\\" misfires. Len stumbles, but Clough catches Ziphora, his girlfriend, but lets her go. Later, Len beats him, and he admits to having told her everything ‚Äì just as he told Clara about Robbins and Nash. Len visits Mohammed and advises him to move somewhere safer, because the British will not protect him. But Mohammed will not be scared into leaving. Erin feels out of place at a party with Eliza's friends. On a laptop, she watches news of another suicide bombing. She argues with Paul, who does not understand why this is all so important to her. Len is driving Mohammed's son Hassan back from a maths exam. He turns off down a track to investigate a column of smoke from the village of Deir Yassin. Jewish fighters are going from house to house, throwing in grenades and shooting the occupants. Men are being forced into the village square and shot. One of the fighters is Clara. She asks him to join her, but Len turns and leaves. He later confronts Rowntree, but Rowntree is under a direct order that British lives are not to be risked protecting the Arabs. Erin goes to see Omar, but he too initially refuses to help. She shows him the key, and he explains its importance to displaced Palestinian families, and then shows her the key to his own uncle's house in Jaffa.cf Robert Fisk, The Keys of Palestine, from Pity the Nation: the Abduction of Lebanon (1st ed, 1990; chapter based on articles published in The Times, December 1980) He agrees to take her to Gaza. While on the bus Erin dreams she is making love with Len. Len's platoon is in Haifa, stationed between the Jewish and Arab- controlled areas, overlooked by armed Jewish irregulars. They are ordered to pull back, but Len orders them to hold the position to prevent Jewish mortar attack on souk. Len goes to find Rowntree, but he is gone and the last personnel is evacuating the base. The roads are clogged with Arab refugees. Mohammed insists that the Arab armies will protect them; but Len tells him that they will come too late: the Jews will arrive by nightfall. The family leaves home and Len drives them to the docks, where the Royal Navy is taking people to Acre. Mohammed commands Hassan to keep the house key safe, because one day they will return. Hassan goes missing in the crowds, and Len promises to go back and find him, persuading Mohammed to get his wife and daughter to safety. Len returns to his men and fills a bag with grenades and ammunition, ordering Alec to take the men to the docks. Erin and Omar are led through a tunnel into Gaza. A taxi takes them to a house of a cousin of Mohammed's, where relatives have gathered for the funeral for his daughter, who had been the suicide bomber of the previous night. Erin sits by herself on the roof, overlooked by a military watch-tower. A young girl Samira pulls her in, miming that it is not safe. In her room, the girl gets Erin to brush her hair. That night there is shooting; Erin comforts the girl, as the house comes under gunfire. Later, she is woken by arguing from downstairs. The son, who is with Hamas, is brandishing a gun and telling Omar, a Fatah member, to go. But the house is raided by Israeli soldiers. Omar and the son run off, while Erin and the family are confined in a bedroom. An IDF officer takes Erin's name and address, while the son is marched away. In the morning, the IDF are searching the house. Eliza appears to deal with Erin, called as a favour to her father. Len finds Hassan fighting with a small group of Arabs, under fire from a sniper. Len takes charge, only to find that the sniper is Jackie Clough, who has joined the Jewish militants. He confiscates his rifle and lets him go. He leads the group under fire through backstreets, until they can see the sea. Len agrees to stay and fight, if Hassan will go to the docks. But as Hassan sets out across open ground, he is hit by a bullet. Before he dies, he asks Len to promise to give the key back to his father. Back at the docks, Len tries to find Mohammed, but is caught and arrested by two military policemen, who had been tipped off by Alec to make sure Len gets home. IDF soldiers take Samira for a human shield when they go to occupy the brother's house. As Samira becomes frantic, Erin suggests that they take her also. They walk to the house, and are confined in the room of a bedridden old woman, who tells Erin she learned English from the British. She shows Erin a photograph; it is the photograph of Len with Mohammed and his family. She is Mohammed's daughter Jawda, with fond memories of Len, but she says her father was angry with him for many years as he failed to bring Hassan back. Erin produces the key, and as soldiers come in she clutches it in her hand. The IDF lay explosives in the house. Erin finds a toolbox, and chains herself and Samira to a pillar.The chain incident was based on the experience of an ISM activist The IDF commander tells Eliza to get a cutter, and she is freed. Outside, Erin finds Jawda being loaded into an ambulance, as the houses are blown up and a bulldozer moves towards the rubble. In the debris Erin retrieves some trinkets in a box and the photograph album, and in the ambulance gives them to Jawda. However, an IDF soldier forcibly takes away the box. Erin starts to remonstrate, but is seized by another fit. Later, Erin is back in Caesarea, gathering her things. She thanks Eliza's parents for her stay, and Paul hopes she may come back one day. As she flies home, Erin turns to the last page of Len's diary. He is leaving Palestine as prisoner on a Royal Navy ship. He writes that the Jewish state has been born in violence and cruelty, and worries that it will not thrive. For himself, he says all he has to look forward to is a long prison term and a dishonourable discharge. He wishes that one day he can return the key to Mohammed, though he is not sure he could face him. At the airport, Erin surprises her mother with the intensity of her embrace. In the hospital, she holds her grandfather's hand, and tells him she has given Mohammed's daughter the key. A single tear runs down his face, and her own eyes also fill with tears.  Production  = Research = The idea for The Promise arose from the 1999 drama Warriors, Kosminsky's sympathetic portrayal of British troops peacekeeping in central Bosnia in 1992‚Äì93, their hands tied by an impossible mandate. A former soldier wrote to its executive producer Jane Tranter at the BBC,DVD Commentary (Peter Kosminsky and Hal Vogel), at 20:10 suggesting she should do a film about the forgotten British soldiers who had been in Palestine. Tranter passed the letter to Kosminsky, who initially put it to one side. However, after completing The Project in 2002, Kosminsky presented the subject as a possible theme for a future drama, and the BBC agreed to support research on it. The BBC's Sarah Barton, subsequently assisted by Sarah MacFarlane, began making contacts through regimental groups and the Palestine Veterans Association, ultimately conducting detailed interviews with 82 veterans, many of them speaking about things they had never told their wives and families.Production Focus: The Promise, Royal Television Society event, 16 March 2011 These oral accounts were compared with archive material in books and from the Red Cross, the National Archives and the Imperial War Museum, including the weekly military intelligence digests. Kosminsky was particularly struck by the house demolitions carried out by the British, and with what other parallels might exist with the present. The research team contacted newly emerging groups of critical IDF veterans, Breaking the Silence and Combatants for Peace. According to Kosminsky, it took him eleven months to read all the research, including over 40 books that researchers had prepared for him, while thinking how to distill it into a workable drama.Miri Weingarten, The Promise: Interview with Peter Kosminsky, JNews, 24 March 2011 = Characters and construction = Kosminsky says that his overriding aim was to present the experience of the 100,000 British soldiers who served in Palestine, \\"to remind us all of what happened\\".Peter Kosminsky: Episode 1 Q&A;, Channel 4 website, 6 February 2011 After leaving Palestine nobody had wanted to remember,Sophie Bourdais, Peter Kosminsky: \\"Britain has a responsibility in the current Palestinian conflict\\" , T√©l√©rama, 22 March 2011 the veterans had been \\"shunned\\"; they had \\"returned home to find the nation that wanted nothing to do with them\\", with no memorial, and were denied even \\"the right to march to the Cenotaph in formation\\". Most found it incredibly hard to talk about their experiences. \\"I was determined that their story be told.\\"Macha S√©ry, Israel- Palestine: to the origins of the conflict , T√©l√©Visions supplement pp.6‚Äì7, Le Monde, 20‚Äì21 March 2011. (text) This was always his aim for the drama, to \\"honour the original letter sent to the BBC\\", so this was always going to be the path of Len's journey. Overwhelmingly, the veterans told a similar story: they had started out \\"incredibly pro-Jewish\\" but they had shifted their allegiance and by the end \\"were feeling a great deal of sympathy for the Arabs\\". \\"A big change came in the final months, as they saw what would happen to the Palestinians, and realised both sides were to be abandoned to a war.\\" \\"It was always going to be necessary for us to faithfully reflect this in our drama,\\" \\"I either had to reflect it or abandon the project.\\"Marcus Dysch, Peter Kosminsky says he kept Promise, The Jewish Chronicle, 31 March 2011 The series was led by what had come out of the interviews, what the soldiers had said and felt, and what they had actually experienced,Camilla Campbell (C4 head of drama), The Promise: Response to the Board of Deputies, dated 18 March 2011 rather than wider historical events with which rank-and-file soldiers had little contact. Of all the reactions to the series, Kosminsky said what meant the most to him was a letter from a veteran, now 85 years old: \\"You did what you said you would. Thank you so much.\\" The character of Erin was influenced by his two teenage daughters, one of whom has epilepsy. Kosminsky felt the trait wasn't often shown on screen unless it was a major plot point, so he liked the idea of showing \\"an eighteen-year-old girl who is trying to live a normal life, despite the fact she occasionally had epileptic fits; and how other people cope with that as well\\".DVD Commentary, at 18:10 For personal reasons, Kosminsky had long wanted to explore the idea of a young person gradually coming to appreciate \\"the young man inside the shell of an older, sick man\\",Interview: Peter Kosminsky, The Jewish Chronicle, 3 February 2011 to the extent that he sees the drama as an unconventional love story,Peter Kosminsky video interview, Canal+ website, at 00:30 capped when Paul tells Erin that the young Len of the diary no longer exists. Erin's passionate response \\"He does to me, he does to me!\\" was for Kosminsky perhaps the most important line in the whole film. The casual relationship Erin has with Eliza, \\"the way they talk, the way they react, their limited attention span\\" was very much drawn from his experience of his daughters and their friends,DVD Commentary, at 53:55 and he felt that the combination of naivety and flinty assertiveness were not atypical of an \\"eighteen-year-old kid from London\\", particularly given an emotionally rather unsympathetic upbringing. It was also important to make the character contrast with the \\"endlessly heroic and gentlemanly\\" Len, so it was intentional that she should be harder to like. However, he hoped that the audience would be won over as they came to understand the character, and that having the audience make this journey would make more powerful what he saw as her later bravery and single-mindedness. Erin's emotional journey intentionally parallels the 1940s arc, because at the heart of it is her increasing engagement with Len. \\"She becomes obsessed with him... she feels what he's feeling... so, by the time we get to Gaza, she patterns herself on what she thinks he would have done.\\" Through the modern story, Kosminsky wanted to show how the past can have consequences for the present, and that having left \\"chaos, political confusion, bloodshed and war\\", Britain has a responsibility for what happens today. \\"It is our problem, at least in part, and we should take some responsibility for it\\".Peter Kosminsky, A film-maker's eye on the Middle East, The Guardian, 28 January 2011 He also writes that what struck him most is a question: \\"How did we get from there to here?\\" In 1945 the Jewish plight had the sympathy of most of the world, but \\"just 60 years later, Israel is isolated, loathed and feared in equal measure by its neighbours, finding little sympathy outside America for its uncompromising view of how to defend its borders and secure its future. How did Israel squander the compassion of the world within a lifetime?\\" This is what The Promise sets out to explore. But \\"It does not help anyone by claiming that good and justice are on one side only. If it were that simple, we would have already found a solution. There are rights and truths on each side, that compete with each other. You can not have everything on one side or the other, everything is meshed together\\" ... \\"There are no good guys and bad guys in this sad situation and we have tried very hard to show pluses and minuses on both sides.\\" \\"I would be very sad if someone were to consider the series as partisan.\\"Marianne Behar, Interview with Peter Kosminsky, director of the Promise , L'Humanit√©, 22 March 2011 What he hoped to create was a kind of unstable equilibrium, so that audiences would find their sympathies shifting, repeatedly, from one side to the other. = Pre-production, further research, and finance = As of 2006 the project had the working title Palestine and was to be made for the BBC by Carnival Films,Ben Dowell, Kosminsky to film Palestinian drama, The Guardian, 12 January 2006 best known as makers of the Poirot series for ITV.

At this stage the treatment ran to 180 pages, with many scenes described in detail. Researchers continued to conduct interviews to enrich the story. Kosminsky flew to Israel with David Aukin, to visit places that would feature in the story, including the normally closed-off Deir Yassin, accompanied by modern Israeli historians organised by their pre-production partners, an Israeli documentary film company. Benny Morris let Kosminsky read a pre-publication proof copy of his book 1948; and from a recent PhD student of Motti Golani at Haifa University Kosminsky heard about the city hospitality clubs, still a stigmatised subject, which shaped the background for Clara in the story.DVD commentary, at 32:40 Scripts followed quickly, and by mid-2008 Channel 4 announced its backing for the project.Matthew Hemley, Channel 4 drama to be Morton‚Äôs directorial debut, The Stage, 25 July 2008 Daybreak had initially costed the drama at ¬£8 million, which with some trimming they had been able to pare back to ¬£7 million. Channel 4 committed ¬£4 million, roughly in line with the channel's hourly rate for prestige drama. Other sources of funding were more difficult. In France, a deal giving Canal + first-run subscription broadcast rights, with free-to-air rights on ARTE a year later, was negotiated by Daybreak's long-standing production contact Georges Campana, bringing in a further ¬£1 million. SBS (a frequent co-producer with ARTE) secured Australian rights, and some top-up funding was obtained from the E.U. media fund. However pre-sale negotiations for America and Germany ran into the sand. Eventually, having put back filming from an original autumn 2009 start, and with everything else ready to go, Kosminsky went back to Channel 4 and said that without another ¬£1 million the series wasn't going to happen. Exceptionally, Channel 4 agreed the extra funding, and filming started in Israel in early 2010 under the revised title Homeland, beginning with the period scenes at Stella Maris. Channel 4 presented its support as part of a ¬£20 million investment in drama, also including This is England '86 and Any Human Heart, made possible by cancellation of the ¬£50 million per series it was previously spending on Big Brother.Leigh Holmwood, Channel 4's extra ¬£20m for drama to fund Shane Meadows' TV debut, The Guardian, 26 August 2009 = Filming = Filming was entirely in Israel, with a predominantly local crew and through the Israeli production company Lama Films; something unusual for a UK television drama production. According to Kosminsky they also looked at Morocco, Cyprus, Southern Spain and Tunisia, and could have recreated the 1940s sequences there; but nowhere else would have replicated the \\"buildings, range of cultures or topography\\" of modern-day Israel.Peter Kosminsky and Hal Vogel, Behind the Scenes: The Promise, Broadcast, 3 February 2011 According to The Guardian: > Over the course of a long career Kosminsky has become adept at turning one > country into another: \\"I used the Czech Republic for Bosnia, Kenya for > Somalia, Ghana for Liberia, Morocco for Iraq, India for Pakistan and Leeds > for Northern Ireland.\\" This time, though, there was no faking it. \\"Israel > looks like nowhere else: the Bauhaus architecture in Tel Aviv, the > physiognomy of its people, who come from all over the world, and most of all > the Wall.

Filming used conventional Super 16mm film, which was then processed and edited in England. The cinematographer, David Higgs, had been keen to try the new Red One high resolution digital camera. However, the team were concerned by the potentially limited contrast ratio using digital ‚Äì a serious consideration in strong Mediterranean light ‚Äì and that its potential bulkiness might inhibit Kosminsky's trademark hand-held cameras following the action. It was also felt that relying on comparatively simple well-known technology would be sensible operating so far from home.DVD commentary, at 55:00 Ironically, however, the reliance on film led to a number of scenes having to be re-mounted after fogging went undetected for a week when it was impossible to get daily film rushes back to London because of the air travel disruption caused by the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano in Iceland.DVD commentary, at 1:04:40 Extensive use was also made of CGI and digital post-production, including for the caf√© explosion, the destruction at the King David Hotel, and the refugee ship of would-be immigrants.The Blu-ray release includes a 5-minute featurette presented by Paddy Eason of digital effects house Nvizible A particular challenge was how to realise the events at Bergen-Belsen. The film-makers considered and rejected a number of options, including live-action and CGI, before reluctantly deciding to fall back on black-and-white library footage from the Imperial War Museum in London, only to come to the view that the resulting sequence had more artistic and moral power than anything they might have been able to create.DVD commentary, at 14:40.

The Deputy Editor, Jenni Frazer, criticised it in her blog published by the paper, for \\"the suggestion that all Israeli Jews live in palatial surroundings with swimming pools and four-star views, the generally hateful depiction of anyone on the Israeli or Jewish side compared with the near-angelic rendering of anyone on the Arab or Palestinian side\\".http://www.thejc.com/blogs/jenni-frazer/under-duvet Writing in The Independent, novelist Howard Jacobson said that in The Promise, \\"Just about every Palestinian was sympathetic to look at, just about every Jew was not.

Mandel describes Kosminsky's body of work as combining \\"epic spirit with historical and journalistic rigour to deal with the conflicts of our time\\". On this series, he writes: \\"Historians will point out some simplifications... Others may complain of political bias towards the view of the English pro-Palestinian left. Nevertheless Kominsky [sic] delivers a historical fiction useful for understanding an intractable conflict\\". while the former commended its \\"epic spirit, rare on television\\".
