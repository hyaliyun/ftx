In Hokkien, Char means “stir-fried” and kway teow refers to flat rice noodles. The dish is considered a national favourite in Malaysia and Singapore. It is made from flat rice noodles () or kway teow (; ) of approximately 1 cm or (in the north of Malaysia) about 0.5 cm in width, stir-fried over very high heat with light and dark soy sauce, chilli, a small quantity of belachan, whole prawns, blood cockles without shells, chopped Chinese chives, slices of Chinese sausage, fishcake, bean sprouts, and less commonly with other ingredients. Char kway teow is traditionally stir-fried in pork fat, with crisp croutons of pork lard. In Penang, Char kway teow is commonly served on a piece of banana leaf on a plate, so as to enhance the aroma on the noodles. Char kway teow has a reputation of being unhealthy due to its high saturated fat content. However, when the dish was first invented, it was mainly served to labourers. The high fat content and low cost of the dish made it attractive to these people as it was a cheap source of energy and nutrients. When the dish was first served, it was often sold by fishermen, farmers and cockle-gatherers who doubled as char kway teow hawkers in the evening to supplement their income. History and etymology The term \\"char kway teow\\" is a transliteration of the Chinese characters 炒粿條 (in simplified Chinese 炒粿条). The dish's name is Hokkien (chhá- kóe-tiâu?), but the dish may have its roots in Chaozhou in China’s Guangdong province and is mostly associated with the Teochew. The word kóe-tiâu (literally meaning \\"ricecake strips\\") generally refers to flat rice noodles, which are the usual ingredient in West Malaysia and Singapore. In East Malaysia, on the other hand, actual sliced ricecake strips are used to make this dish. In popular transliterations, there is no fixed way of spelling chhá-kóe-tiâu, and many variants can be found: e.g., \\"char kueh teow\\", \\"char kuey teow\\", \\"char koay teow\\", \\"char kueh tiao\\" etc. Owing to the dish's popularity and spread to Cantonese-speaking areas, the term \\"char kway teow\\" has been corrupted into \\"炒貴刁\\" (). The term \\"\\" has no real meaning, but its pronunciation in Cantonese and Mandarin is similar to \\"粿條\\" in Min Nan. In Hong Kong, \\"char kway teow\\" is often known as \\"Penang char kway teow\\" (檳城炒粿條 or 檳城炒貴刁). Variations Char Kway Teow Penang Char Kway Teow As the dish has become increasingly popular, many cooks have come up with their own interpretations of the same basic main ingredient of ricecake strips/flat rice noodles fried with anything from eggs (chicken or duck), onions, garlic, prawns, cockles, Chinese sausage, chives, etc. In the past, it was usual to stir-fry char kway teow in pork fat without eggs (which were, however, available on request). More recently, ordinary cooking oil is commonly used for health or religious reasons, and eggs have become a standard ingredient in the dish. Versions of char kway teow prepared by Muslims in Malaysia will exclude pork fat and may include extra soy sauces and spices and the use of broader-width flat rice noodles. A popular version of char kway teow in Malaysia is also known as fried kway teow, where it is not as drenched in sauce as much as char kway teow is. There are also vegetarian varieties that may or may not include eggs. There are also \\"gourmet\\" versions of char kway teow, commonly found in Ipoh and Penang, where the dish may be prepared with more seafood, with crab meat and with duck eggs. Char kway teow is also popular at takeaways in Australia and New Zealand. In Myanmar, a variety called the Beik Kut kyae kaik (the Beik Scissor Cut) exists. It is popular in the southern coastal regions around the town of Myeik (\\"Baik\\" is the Burmese pronunciation) and in Yangon, the largest city in the country. It uses more pepper and seafood compared to the kway teow of Singapore and Malaysia. The rice noodles are slightly thinner and are stir-fried with boiled yellow peas, bean sprouts, squid and prawns, spring onions and dark sweet soy sauce. After being stir-fried, the noodles are cut with scissors (kut kyae in Burmese), thus its name. In many Asian fusion restaurants in America, such as the popular Cafe Asia chain, this dish is offered under the name Gway Tiao. Many Southeast Asian restaurants in Hong Kong offer char kway teow as a Malay speciality although it is of Southeast Asian Chinese origin. The char kway teow served in Hong Kong is an entirely different dish: stir-fried Chinese- style flat rice noodles with prawns, char siu, onions, and bean sprouts, seasoned with curry and bright yellow in colour. In some places this is known as Fried \\"Good Dale\\", a transliteration of the characters \\"炒貴刁\\". In Indonesia, there is a similar dish known as kwetiau goreng () and is served in Chinese restaurants, street side tent warung, and by traveling street hawkers' carts. This Indonesian version tastes mildly sweet with generous addition of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), has spicier and stronger flavor with addition of sambal condiment, less oily, mostly halal which means uses no lard or pork, and normally incorporates beef or chicken to cater to the majority Indonesian Muslim population. However, some Chinese restaurants in Indonesia that mainly serve non-Muslim customers might use pork and pork fat. In Vietnamese cuisine, a similar stir-fried noodle dish is called hủ tiếu xào. Thai cuisine has its own version called Pad see ew. In Singapore, the char kway teow is a popular, inexpensive dish usually eaten for breakfast and sold at food stalls in Singapore.Cheong, S. (2007, March 24). Orr koay teow, anyone. New Straits Times. Retrieved from Factiva. A unique feature to Singaporean style char kway teow is the use of yellow wheat noodles alongside the flat rice noodles. There are also healthier versions with more vegetables and less oil. Furthermore, the greens and bean sprouts give off a fresh, crunchy texture that makes the dish stand out even more from other dishes of the cuisine. There is also an incorporation of seafood (like prawns, cuttlefish, squid, lobster meat), although the typical hawker variety usually uses blood cockles. This version is also common in Perth, Western Australia, which has a large expatriate Singaporean population.

The player controls a barbarian warrior who has embarked on a quest to slay a dragon. While on his way to the dragon's lair, Rastan must fight hordes of enemy monsters based on mythical creatures such as chimeras and harpies. Plot Gameplay The controls of Rastan consists of an eight-way joystick, a button for attacking, and a button for jumping. By using the joystick in combination with either button, the player can determine the height of Rastan's jumps, as well as the direction he swings his weapon (including downwards while jumping). The game uses a health gauge system along with limited lives, although certain obstacles (such as falling into a body of water or being crushed by a spiked ceiling) will instantly kill Rastan regardless of how much health he has left. There are a total of six rounds, each consisting of three areas: an outdoor scene, a castle scene and a throne room where the player must confront the stage's boss. The backgrounds of the outdoor areas feature broad landscapes with changing sunlight effects with detail. The game's bosses (names according to the MSX2 version), in order of appearance, consist of: #King Graton, a halberd-wielding skeletal warrior; #King Slay, a demonic winged sword-master; #Symplegades, the wizard-king; #Laios, the dragon-king; #The Hydra, a five-headed snake-like monster; #The Dragon The player can pick up any item by touching it, as well as new weapons by striking them with his current one. All the weapons and power-ups picked by Rastan will be equipped only for a limited time, except for the Ring power up. The Ring will remain equipped on Rastan for the entirety of his current life, even carrying over to the next stage. When Rastan picks up any equipable item, an icon will appear on the lower right corner of the screen as an indicator of the item's effect until it wears out. Rastan can only wield one weapon at a time (a mace, an axe, a fireball-shooting sword, or his standard sword), as well as only one type of protector (a shield, a mantle, or a body armor), but other items (such as the necklace and ring) can be worn at the same time. There are also jewels that gives out bonus points, as well potion bottles that restore or deplete the player's health depending on the color. The rare golden sheep's head restores Rastan's health completely. Regional differences Rastan Saga (the Japanese version) features an opening sequence, when the player starts the game, which explains the purpose of Rastan's journey. It is not included in the versions released in other countries (which are simply titled Rastan). Also, in the Japanese version when the player completes a stage (\\"Round\\") the \\"victory\\" screen has text pertaining to the storyline. In the international versions, there is a \\"generic\\" victory screen with generic text (\\"You are a brave fighter to have cleared such a difficult stage.\\"). However, the international versions feature a different attract sequence which shows all the items that can be obtained by the player along with their effect. In the Japanese version there are far fewer bats during the bat swarm sequences in the castle of level 1 than in other versions. Ports Rastan was initially ported to various 8-bit home computers in Europe (the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC) by Imagine Software in 1987. The ZX Spectrum version was awarded 9/10 in the July 1988 issue of Your SinclairRastan and was placed at number 54 in the Your Sinclair's Top 100 list. Taito imported Imagine's C64 version to the United States, releasing it alongside two additional versions for the IBM PC and Apple IIGS, both of which were ported by Novalogic. An unreleased version for the Atari ST was discovered in demo form only. In 1988, Taito developed its own conversions for the MSX2 in Japan, and the Master System in North America and Europe. Both ports featured redesigned level layouts, with the Master System version replacing some of the boss characters as well. This version was itself later ported to the Game Gear and released exclusively in Japan on August 9, 1991 as Rastan Saga.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Rastan on their May 1, 1987 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy An emulation of the Rastan arcade game is included in Taito Legends, released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows PC in 2006. The game was followed by two sequels, Rastan Saga II (known as Nastar in Europe and Nastar Warrior in North America) and Warrior Blade: Rastan Saga Episode III. Rastan also made an appearance in another Taito game titled Champion Wrestler as \\"Miracle Rastan\\". The Saffire developed game Barbarian was released under the name Warrior Blade: Rastan vs. Barbarian in Japan as Taito published the game in the region. The game has nothing to do with Rastan despite the title change. The game was released in Japan on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. The GameCube version's release was cancelled in North America and Europe due to poor sales. Indie game Völgarr the Viking, developed by Crazy Viking Studios for Windows, OS X, Linux, Xbox One, and Dreamcast, was described on its Kickstarter page as based on Rastan.

History The church is built on part of the site of the Roman city Melite, which included all of Mdina and a large part of present-day Rabat. There were numerous churches built on the site of the present church which dates from the 17th century. In 1336 bishop Hilarius refers to the church as ecclesia Sancti Pauli de crypta, and also mentions the cemetery and the Roman ditch. The present church was built to replace a church which was completed in 1578. The new church was built with funds provided by the noble woman Guzmana Navarra on plans prepared by Francesco Buonamici. The church building commenced in 1653 was completed by Lorenzo Gafà in 1683. Annexed with the church of St Paul is a smaller church dedicated to St Publius which was rebuilt in 1692 and again in 1726 by Salvu Borg. The church was elevated to a Minor Basilica in 2020. The Grotto Entrance to the grotto is through the church of St Publius. The grotto is the place where according to tradition St Paul lived and preached during his three months stay in Malta in 60 A.D. In 1748 Grand Master Pinto donated a statue of St Paul for the grotto. The grotto was visited by two Popes, Pope John Paul II in 1990 and 2001 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. The grotto is linked to the Wignacourt Museum. The church is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

Directed by George Tillman Jr. and written by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker, the film stars Jamal Woolard as Wallace, alongside Angela Bassett, Derek Luke, and Anthony Mackie. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $44.4 million on a $20 million budget. Plot The film opens at a party in Los Angeles on March 9, 1997. Just as The Notorious B.I.G. is about to be killed in a shooting, the film flashes back to Biggie's childhood in Brooklyn, New York, where he lived during his childhood years as a hard-working school student before he begins dealing drugs. Christopher (The Notorious B.I.G.'s real name), now older, sells drugs at the height of the crack epidemic, hustling with his friends \\"D-Roc\\" and Lil' Cease. When his girlfriend, Jan Jackson, tells him that she is pregnant, he takes drug dealing more seriously so he can earn more money to support his growing family. Christopher eventually participates in a rap battle, where he wins, but his mother, Voletta Wallace, kicks him out of the house after finding drugs underneath his bed and also because of the fact letters were sent home about him not attending school. Chris gets caught with guns and drugs, and he serves nine months in jail before being bailed out. Christopher meets Kim Jones, but Kim refuses to pursue a relationship with him due to her abusive past. After reconciling with his mother and visiting his newborn daughter, T'yanna, he records a demo under the name \\"Biggie Smalls\\", which catches the attention of Puff, an ambitious record producer working for Uptown. Puffy promises him a record deal, but Puffy later tells Biggie that he was fired by Uptown, to their mutually shared disappointment. Soon afterwards, he and D-Roc are again arrested for possessing a gun, but D-Roc takes the blame to allow Biggie to pursue his music career. Biggie becomes depressed when he finds out his mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer, but is cheered up when Puffy signs him to his newly established record label, Bad Boy, and he records his debut album, Ready to Die. At a Bad Boy photoshoot, Biggie meets R&B; singer Faith Evans. The pair begin a relationship and get married on August 9, 1994, after only knowing each other for eight days; however, Faith catches him cheating, putting an end to the relationship. The two later reconcile, but the tensions between Biggie, Faith, Jan, and Kim continue to grow. Biggie meets Tupac Shakur at a party celebrating the release of Ready to Die. Biggie admires 2Pac, but questions people he associates with, telling him to watch the company he keeps while he's in New York. When 2Pac is robbed and shot five times at Quad Studios, he blames Bad Boy. At The Source Awards in 1995, Suge Knight makes a speech dissing Bad Boy Records. After altercations between the two rappers, the disagreement escalates into the media, who capitalize on the tension and stoke the flames of an \\"East Coast–West Coast rivalry\\", and attacks are made on both sides. At the 1996 Soul Train Awards in Los Angeles, Biggie receives a death threat from an unknown caller; it is one of several that he has received throughout the day. At the afterparty, 2Pac and Suge Knight verbally assault Biggie, but they leave when Biggie's security detail threatens them. A song called \\"Who Shot Ya?\\" is released by Biggie, which is interpreted as a diss track by 2Pac. Biggie and Puffy claim that \\"Who Shot Ya?\\" was recorded before 2Pac was shot, but 2Pac responds with \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" where he disses Biggie, Puffy, Junior Mafia and the rest of the Bad Boy entourage. 2Pac also claims he had sex with Faith. After seeing a magazine photo of 2Pac and Faith together, Biggie accuses Faith of infidelity, but she insists nothing happened between her and 2Pac. Biggie and Faith attempt to reconcile after she tells him that she is pregnant with his son, CJ Wallace, on October 29, 1996. The rivalry between the East and West Coast continues to escalate. At a concert in Sacramento, California, Biggie gets booed. After this, Biggie performs \\"Who Shot Ya?\\". The rivalry between Biggie and 2Pac continues until 2Pac is killed in Las Vegas, Nevada. Voletta tells Biggie that 2Pac was probably killed as a result of their feud, which shakes him up. Biggie attempts to ease the tensions in his life by visiting Jan and T'Yanna more often. Biggie and D-Roc renew their friendship after D-Roc is released from prison, and Biggie confides to him that he wants out of the rap game. However, Biggie decides to go to Los Angeles to promote his upcoming album, Life After Death, bringing D-Roc and Lil' Cease with him, along with Puff Daddy and Faith. While out in L.A., Biggie receives more death threats. After calling Lil' Kim to apologize and arrange a meeting with her, he leaves the party. The film returns to the opening scene, where Biggie is killed by an unknown assailant. His funeral is held a few days later, where friends and colleagues mourn, along with thousands of fans, who line the streets to pay their respects. In the epilogue, Voletta self-reflects on Biggie's life, stating that while she is hurt that he was taken before his time - she finds peace in the fact that he accomplished his dream and left a lasting impact. A member of the crowd turns on a ghetto blaster which plays Biggie's song \\"Hypnotize\\", and the crowd dances as Biggie's casket is driven down the city's streets.

Lil' Kim's scenes in the film contained a significant amount of nudity and sexuality. The film's producers, including Voletta Wallace, downplayed her comments.

The fruiting body is distinguished by its noticeably ear-like shape and brown colouration; it grows upon wood, especially elder. Its specific epithet is derived from the belief that Judas Iscariot hanged himself from an elder tree; the common name \\"Judas's ear\\" was largely eclipsed by the corruption \\"Jew's ear\\", while today \\"jelly ear\\" and other names are preferred. The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide, where it grows upon both dead and living wood. In the West, A. auricula-judae was used in folk medicine as recently as the 19th century for complaints including sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent. Although it is not widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century. Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as hot and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana, as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that A. auricula-judae has antitumour, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant and cholesterol- lowering properties. Taxonomy and naming Judas se pend (Judas Hangs Himself), by James Tissot. It is from the belief Judas Iscariot hanged himself on an elder tree that both the specific name auricula-judae and the common name Jew's ear originate. The medieval Latin name auricula Judae (Judas's Ear) matches the vernacular name in most European languages (c.f. French oreille de Judas, German Judasohr). The mistranslation \\"Jew's Ear\\" appeared in English by 1544.Oxford English Dictionary. \\"Erroneous rendering of medieval Latin auricula Judae Judas' ear\\" http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/101238?redirectedFrom=Jew's+ear& The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature as Tremella auricula by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, and later (1789) described by Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Tremella auricula-judae. However, the genus Tremella is now reserved for fungal species that live as parasites on other fungi. Tremella auricula-judae is now considered a basionym. In 1791, Bulliard transferred the species to the genus Peziza. In 1822, Elias Magnus Fries transferred the species to Exidia, and, in so doing, sanctioned the name. In 1860, Miles Joseph Berkeley described the species as a member of Hirneola, a genus described by Fries in 1848, now considered synonymous with Auricularia. The species was given the name Auricularia auricula-judae in 1888 by Joseph Schröter. The specific name of A. auricula-judae comprises auricula, the Latin word meaning ear, and Judae, meaning of Judas. Under binomial nomenclature, a species name can comprise only two words; but the taxonomists responsible for this naming hyphenated the specific name to \\"bend the rules\\" and keep the name \\"within the letter of the law\\".Harding 2008, p. 118 The name was criticised by mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, who said \\"Auricularia auricula-Judae is cumbersome and in addition is a slander on the Jews\\". Though critical of Lucien Marcus Underwood, saying he \\"would probably not have known the Jew's ear from the calves' liver\\", he followed him in using Auricularia auricula, which was in turn used by Bernard Lowy in an article on the entire genus.Lowy 1952, p. 660 Despite this, Auricularia auricula-judae is the currently recognised name for the species by many sources, though Auricularia auricula is still occasionally used. As well as the obligate synonyms from Bulliard, Fries and Berkeley, there are numerous other synonymous names. Mycologist George Willard Martin, writing in 1943, noted that the species was known by at least 12 binomials, of which none appeared to be valid, and noted that \\"the citations given for the various names are extremely erratic\\".Martin 1943, p. 77 Mycologist Mary F. Barrett attributes \\"such multiplication of names\\" to \\"the wide distribution of the Judas's ear, its ability to grow upon many different kinds of decaying wood, and to its great variation in size, colour and shape\\". The fungus is associated with Judas Iscariot because of the belief that he hanged himself on an elder tree after his betrayal of Jesus Christ. Folklore suggests that the ears are Judas's returned spirit, and are all that are left to remind us of his suicide. The common name of the fungus was originally \\"Judas's ear\\", but this was later shortened to \\"Judas ear\\" and then \\"Jew's ear\\".Harding 2008, p. 120 Common names for the fungus which refer to Judas can be traced back to at least the end of the 16th century;Barrett 1910, p. 13 for instance, in the 17th century, Thomas Browne wrote of the species: > In Jews' ears something is conceived extraordinary from the name, which is > in propriety but fungus sambucinus, or an excrescence about the roots of > elder, and concerneth not the nation of the Jews, but Judas Iscariot, upon a > conceit he hanged on this tree; and is become a famous medicine in quinsies, > sore throats, and strangulations, ever since. While the term \\"Jew's meat\\" was a deprecatory term used for all fungi in the Middle Ages, the term is unrelated to the name \\"Jew's ear\\". A further change of name to \\"jelly ear\\" was recommended in the List of Recommended Names for Fungi. The idea was criticised by the mycologist Patrick Harding, who considered it \\"to be the result of political correctness where it is not necessary\\", and who \\"will continue to call [the species] Jew's ear\\", explaining that, while anti-Semitism was commonplace in Britain, the name \\"Jew's ear\\" is in reference to Judas, who was a Jew.Harding 2008, p. 120 Unrelated common names include the \\"ear fungus\\", \\"common ear fungus\\",Boa 2004, p. 21 \\"the Chinese Fungus\\", \\"the pig's ear\\",Young and Smith 2005, p. 56 \\"the wood ear\\", \\"the black wood ear\\", \\"the tree ear\\", and \\"Kikurage\\". The species was known as \\"fungus sambuca\\" among herbalists, in reference to Sambuca, the generic name for elder. Description The fruit body of A. auricula-judae is normally across, but can be as much as . It is distinctively shaped, typically being reminiscent of a floppy ear, though the fruit bodies can also be cup- shaped. It is normally attached to the substrate laterally and sometimes by a very short stalk. The species has a tough, gelatinous, elastic texture when fresh, but it dries hard and brittle. The outer surface is a bright reddish- tan-brown with a purplish hint, often covered in tiny, downy hairs of a grey colour. It can be smooth, as is typical of younger specimens, or undulating with folds and wrinkles. The colour becomes darker with age. The inner surface is a lighter grey-brown in colour and smooth. It is sometimes wrinkled, again with folds and wrinkles, and may have \\"veins\\", making it appear even more ear- like. =Microscopic features= The spores of A. auricula-judae are long and sausage shaped, ranging in size from 16 to 18 micrometres (μm) long by 6 to 8 μm thick. The spores themselves are white, cream or yellowish, and are hyaline. The spores can sometimes be seen in a whitish mass on the underside of the fruit body. The species has elongated cylindrical basidia with three transverse septa (internal cross-walls dividing the hyphae). Basidia 60–72 μm × 4–7.5 μm; sterigmata lateral, well developed, 3–4.5 μm long. Spores smooth, hyaline, reniform to allantoid, 14–18 μm × 6-8 μm, guttulate. Hairs on the fruit body are from 85 to 100 μm in length, and 5 to 6 μm in diameter. They are hyaline, lack a central strand and have rounded tips. They do not grow in dense tufts. =Similar species= Auricularia auricula-judae is similar to A. fuscosuccinea in colour and texture, and \\"may be confused with it if only external features are considered\\". The spore and basidia sizes of the two species are slightly different, but this is not a reliable way to tell them apart.Lowy 1952, pp. 660, 662 A. cornea is another similar species in the same genus, but has distinct internal differences, is normally more pilose (more covered in soft hair) and tends to fruit in larger numbers.Lowy 1952, p. 662 Habitat, ecology and distribution Auricularia auricula-judae fruit bodies can be found in large numbers on old wood. Auricularia auricula-judae grows upon the wood of deciduous trees and shrubs, favouring elder. In up to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder.Harding 2008, p. 121 It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs.Young and Smith 2004, p. 64 It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (on living wood), and it causes white rot. Commonly growing solitarily, it can also be gregarious (in a group) or caespitose (in a tuft).Lowy 1952, p. 658 Spores are ejected from the underside of the fruit bodies with as many as several hundred thousand an hour, and the high rate continues when the bodies have been significantly dried. Even when they have lost some 90% of their weight through dehydration, the bodies continue to release a small number of spores. It is found all year, but is most common in autumn. It is widespread throughout temperate and sub- tropical zones worldwide, and can be found across Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa. There has been some debate about the appearance of the species in the tropics; while it has been frequently reported there, Bernard Lowy, in an article on Auricularia, said that \\"of the specimens I have examined, none could be assigned here\\". Also found on the Galapagos Island, Isla Santa Cruz. Uses =Food= Auricularia auricula-judae has a soft, jelly-like texture. Though edible, it was not held in high culinary regard in the west for many years. It has been likened to \\"eating an Indian rubber with bones in it\\", while in 19th-century Britain, it was said that \\"it has never been regarded here as an edible fungus\\". It has a mild flavour, and is useful for mixed mushroom recipes, but is still considered bland in the west. It can be dried and rehydrated, sometimes swelling to a very large size. Young specimens are best, but the species is not edible when raw, needing to be cooked thoroughly. The whole fruit body can be eaten, but should be thoroughly washed before cooking. Cooking can sometimes take a comparatively long time. A reference serving of dried fungus provides of food energy, 10.6 g of protein, 0.2 g of fat, 65 g of carbohydrate, 5.8 g ash, and 0.03% mg of carotene. Fresh mushrooms contain about 90% moisture. Dried specimens may be ground up into a powder and used to absorb excess liquid in soups and stews, as it rehydrates into tiny fragments. Both A. auricula-judae and the similar A. polytricha are popular in China, and are known by the general name of \\"wood ears\\" (). The medicinal use of food is common in China: a soup containing the species is used medicinally for dealing with colds and fevers by reducing the heat of the body.Acton and Sandler 2001, p. 134Acton and Sandler 2001, p. 124 There is evidence that the species were being cultivated in China as early as the Tang dynasty (618–907). Li Shizhen, in his Pen Tsao Kang Mu, quotes Tang Ying-chuan from that period as saying \\"... put the steamed bran on logs, cover with straw, Wood Ear will grow\\". In the early 20th century, large volumes of A. auricula-judae were exported from Australia to China, and it is today still sold in Asian food shops for culinary use. It is also popular in Vietnam, although the climate is there more suited to A. polytricha. A report on small- scale fungi cultivation concluded that A. auricula-judae would be suitable for cultivation only in cooler climates. According to a 2010 publication, the annual production of Auricularia species worldwide is the fourth highest among all industrially cultivated culinary and medicinal mushrooms, and in China, the estimated output was roughly 1.655 million tonnes (based on 2003 data), most of which are A. polytricha however (which has by and large replaced A. auricula-judae in international trade). Auricularia auricula-judae is also in cultivation elsewhere in the world, for instance, in Ghana. In the Brong-Ahafo and Ashanti regions, it is grown with what is referred to as the \\"plastic bag method\\". Sawdust is packed into polypropylene bags and then sterilised by steam for several hours. Once the sawdust has cooled, Sorghum grain spawn is added, and the bags are kept in moderately dark conditions. Once the sawdust is exposed to a humid environment, A. auricula-judae fruit bodies begin to grow.Apetorgbor et al. 2005, pp. 5–6 Elsewhere in the world, a study on the use of mushrooms by the Bini people inhabiting a remote village in southern Nigeria found that the local inhabitants collected and ate A. auricula-judae, but that it was not one of the mushrooms they used medicinally. Collection of the mushroom for culinary use has also been documented in Nepal. However, the Nepalese do not consider it a choice mushroom for eating; of the three grades given to edible mushrooms, it was given the worst. Again, unlike other mushrooms, no medicinal use was reported. The mushroom has also been the only non-morel species exported from Nepal for culinary use. Other places where A. auricula-judae has been recorded as commonly consumed include Poland,Boa 2004, p. 12 MozambiqueBoa 2004, p. 121 and Indonesia,Boa 2004, p. 115 while, in Bolivia, Goeldi's monkeys have been recorded as commonly eating the sporocarps. Koreans commonly use it in japchae. =Folk medicine= 16th- century herbalist John Gerard recommended Auricularia auricula-judae for curing a sore throat. Auricularia auricula-judae has been used as a medicinal mushroom by many herbalists. It was used as a poultice to treat inflammations of the eye, as well as a palliative for throat problems. The 16th-century herbalist John Gerard, writing in 1597, recommended A. auricula-judae for a very specific use; other fungi were used more generally. He recommends the preparation of a liquid extract by boiling the fruit bodies in milk, or else leaving them steeped in beer, which would then be sipped slowly in order to cure a sore throat.Harding 2008, p. 173 The resultant broth was probably not dissimilar to the Chinese soups that use A. polytricha. Carolus Clusius, writing in 1601, also said that the species could be gargled to cure a sore throat,Barrett 1910, p. 14 and John Parkinson, writing in 1640, reported that boiling in milk or steeping in vinegar was \\"the onely use the are put unto that I know\\". Writing in 1694, herbalist John Pechey described A. auricula- judae by saying \\"It grows to the Trunk of the Elder-Tree. Being dried it will keep a good year. Boyl'd in Milk, or infus'd in Vinegarm 'tis good to gargle the Mouth or Throat in Quinsies, and other inflammations of the Mouth and Throat. And being infus'd in some proper Water, it is good in Diseases of the Eyes.\\" The species also saw use as an astringent due to its ability to absorb water. There are recorded medicinal usages from Scotland, where it was again used as a gargle for sore throats, and from Ireland, where, in an attempt to cure jaundice, it was boiled in milk. The medicinal use of A. auricula-judae continued until at least 1860, when it was still sold at Covent Garden; at the time, it was not considered edible in the United Kingdom. Medicinal use in Indonesia was also recorded in the 1930s, and was more recently reported in modern-day Ghana. A report for the 2005 Commonwealth Forestry Conference examining the possible effects of deforestation in southern Ghana on medicinal and edible fungi found that A. auricula-judae was in use as a blood tonic.Apetorgbor et al. 2005, p. 10 =Pharmacology= Dried Auricularia auricula-judae Auricularia auricula-judae has been the subject of research into possible medicinal applications. Experiments in the 1980s concluded that two glucans isolated from the species showed potent antitumour properties when used on mice artificially implanted with Sarcoma 180 tumours. This was despite the conclusion of earlier research indicating that, while aqueous extracts from several other fungal species had antitumour effects, extracts from A. auricula-judae did not. Further, research on genetically diabetic mice showed that a polysaccharide extracted from A. auricula-judae had a hypoglycemic effect; mice fed with food including the polysaccharide showed reduced plasma glucose, insulin, urinary glucose and food intake. Another chemical extracted from the species was an acidic polysaccharide (made up of mostly mannose, glucose, glucuronic acid and xylose) which showed anticoagulant properties. The article concluded that \\"the polysaccharides from these mushrooms may constitute a new source of compounds with action on coagulation, platelet aggregation and, perhaps, on thrombosis\\". Another study reported that the species may be effective in stopping platelet binding in vitro, with possible uses regarding hypercholesterolemia. Research has shown that A. auricula-judae can be used to lower cholesterol levels generally, and, in particular, is one of two fungi shown to reduce the level of bad cholesterol. Cultural depictions The species is referred to in Christopher Marlowe's play The Jew of Malta. Iathamore proclaims: \\"The hat he wears, Judas left under the elder when he hanged himself\\". Later, the species was probably partially the inspiration for Emily Dickinson's poem beginning \\"The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants\\", which depicts a mushroom as the \\"ultimate betrayer\\". Dickinson had both a religious and naturalistic background, and so it is more than likely that she knew of the common name of A. auricula-judae, and of the folklore surrounding Judas's suicide.Harding 2008, pp. 193–4 References Cited texts   Category:Chinese edible mushrooms Category:Auriculariales Category:Fungi described in 1789 Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of Australia Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Africa Category:Medicinal fungi Category:Fungi in cultivation Category:Buddhist cuisine Category:Judas Iscariot ","title":"Auricularia auricula-judae"},{"id":"47769564","text":"The Purple Hills (originally titled \\"The Vanishing Frontier\\") is a 1961 American Western film directed by Maury Dexter and written by Russ Bender and Edith Cash Pearl.

It was originally described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815 as a species of Hydnum. Petter Karsten included it as one of the original three species when he circumscribed Phellodon in 1881. The fungus is found in Europe and North America, although molecular studies suggest that the North American populations represent a similar but genetically distinct species. Taxonomy Phellodon niger was originally described by Swedish mycologist Elias Fries in 1815 as a species of Hydnum. The genus Phellodon was circumscribed in 1881 by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten to contain white-toothed fungi. Karsten included three species: P. cyathiformis, P. melaleucus, and the type, P. niger (originally published with the epithet \\"nigrum\\"). The variety Phellodon niger var. alboniger, published by Kenneth Harrison in 1961, is considered synonymous with Phellodon melaleucus. Lucien Quélet's 1886 Calodon niger is a synonym of Phellodon niger. Taxonomic synonyms (i.e., based on a different type) include: Hydnum olidum (Berkeley, 1877); Hydnum cuneatum (Lloyd 1925); and Hydnum confluens (Peck 1874). The DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions of collections from the United Kingdom were compared with collections made in the Southern United States. They showed a 92–93% similarity, suggesting that the North American populations are a different species with very similar morphological characteristics. Phellodon niger is commonly known as the \\"black scented spine fungus\\", and the \\"black tooth\\". Description Underside of fruitbody, showing spines Fruitbodies of Phellodon niger have a cap and a stipe, and so fall into the general class of \\"stipitate hydnoid fungi\\". Individual caps are up to in diameter, but caps of neighboring fruitbodies often fuse together to create larger compound growths. Caps are flat to depressed to somewhat funnel-shaped, with a felt-like texture at first before developing concentric pits, wrinkles, and ridges. Initially whitish (sometimes with purplish tints), the cap later darkens in the center to grey, grey-brown, or black. The stipe, measuring up to long, is roughly the same color as the cap. On the underside of the caps are grey spines, up to 4 mm long. The outer covering of the stipe is a thick felty layer of mycelium that absorbs water like a sponge. In conditions of high humidity, P. niger can form striking drops of black liquid on the actively growing caps. The flesh has an odor of fenugreek when it is dry. The mushroom tissue turns bluish- green when tested with a solution of potassium hydroxide. The ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent) spores measure 3.5–5 by 3–4 µm. The basidia (spore- bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–40 by 5–7 µm. Phellodon niger has a monomitic hyphal system, producing generative hyphae with a diameter of 2.5–5 µm. Habitat and distribution The ectomycorrhizae that P. niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P. niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host. Phellodon niger is found in continental Europe, where it has a widespread distribution, and in North America. In a preliminary assessment for a red list of threatened British fungi, P. niger is considered rare. In Switzerland, it is considered a vulnerable species. Phellodon niger was included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers that can be used to detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. Collections labelled as P. niger from the United Kingdom that were DNA tested, revealed additional cryptic species. Analysis using PCR can determine the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction. Chemistry Phellodon niger has been a source for several bioactive compounds: the cyathane-type diterpenoids, nigernin A and B; a terphenyl derivative called phellodonin (2',3'-diacetoxy-3,4,5',6',4-pentahydroxy-p-terphenyl); grifolin; and 4-O-methylgrifolic acid. Additional nigernins (C through F) were reported in 2011. Fruitbodies are used to make a gray-blue or green dye.

History The street was developed by in the late 18th century by Henry Moore, 1st Earl of Drogheda whose estate lands and developments is reflected in the street names bearing his name, Henry Street, Moore Street, Of Lane (now Off Lane) and Drogheda Street. North Earl Street was a direct continuation of Henry Street eastwards. Henry Moore, 3rd Viscount Moore, 1st Earl of Drogheda who came into possession of lands in this area around what is now the Spire on O’Connell St in 1661 following the Restoration of the Monarchy. Laying out the streets, Henry was clearly a man who wished to leave a legacy. He named some of his new streets Henry St, Moore St, Earl St (now North Earl St), Drogheda St, Mellefont Place (which was Tucker’s Row and became Cathedral St). A small lane, now called Henry Place, linking Moore St to Henry St was called Of or Off Lane. Clearly Henry had used every other combination of his titles, and was left with using the prepositions. It was sometimes formerly called Earl Street North. Earl Street North c. 1900  Easter Rising and Independence  During the Easter Rising in 1916, North Earl Street was badly damaged along with O'Connell Street. Much of the street was reconstructed from 1917 onwards, with Edwardian Baroque or Empire Revival style by architects such as O'Callaghan & Webb. These buildings are characterised by their use of classical facades with brick and granite. Madigans Pub was also rebuilt at this time, and contains some stained-glass windows by Harry Clarke. Some of the Georgian buildings further away from the junction with O'Connell Street survived 1916, and form part of the older streetscape. These include a townhouse on the corner of Marlborough Street from the late 1780s. Other buildings feature Victorian stucco fronts.  Regeneration  Statue of James Joyce North Earl Street was pedestrianised in the 1980s along with a number of other city centre streets. A statue of James Joyce by Marjorie Fitzgibbon was installed on the street in 1990 as part of this redevelopment. It was commissioned by the Dublin City Centre Business Association. The statue is known colloquially as \\"the prick with the stick\\". The store hearing-aid shop, Bonovox at 9 North Earl Street, is reputedly the inspiration for Paul Hewson's choice as Bono for his stage name. From the 1960s, the department store Boyers & Co. operated from North Earl Street. It closed in 2016, and was redeveloped as a Sports Direct. During this time the street was characterised as dominated by discount stores and euro shops and a decline in the condition of the street. This followed the closure of Clerys in 2015, which also faces onto North Earl Street and Earl Place. This site went under development as the Clerys Quarter in 2019. These side entrances to the department store dated originally from 1979.

The most impacted states are those of the Nigerian Middle Belt like Benue, Taraba and Plateau. Violence has reached two peaks in 2004 and 2011 with around 2,000 fatalities those years. It resulted in more than 700 fatalities in 2015 alone.  Causes  Climate change played a major role in the migration of Fulani herdsmen. African countries have been affected the most by climate change globally. This notion has contributed to the migration of Fulani Herdsmen from the North towards southwest Nigeria. As observed from a \\"Push and pull\\" model, desertification, landslides, droughts, pollution, sand storms, and diseases that have all transpired from climatic changes have led Fulani Herdsmen to leave their communities. This is mostly due to droughts which timespans have persisted longer than anticipated, such as the evaporation of Lake Chad. Moreover, diseases have developed from climatic conditions and is killing the animals of these herdsmen. Thus, many Fulani's, also known as \\"the Bororos\\", are inclined to migrate south where there is improved vegetation, weather conditions, market opportunities, and hopefulness. Herder–farmer conflicts Since the Fourth Nigerian Republic's founding in 1999, farmer-herder violence has killed thousands of people and displaced tens of thousands more. Insecurity and violence have led many populations to create self-defence forces and ethnic militias, which have engaged in further violence. The majority of farmer–herder clashes have occurred between Muslim Fulani herdsmen and Christian peasants, exacerbating ethnoreligious hostilities. This violence stems from the relationship between the Bororo Fulani and the Yoruba farmers. Prior to this, the Fulani people had migrated into the southwestern Nigeria region centuries ago. In fact, in the 18th century, three different groups of Fulani had migrated to the city of Iseyin. These groups consisted of the Bangu, Sokoto, and Bororo Fulani. Out of these three groups, the Bororo Fulani in particular were the group to separate themselves from the Yoruba farmers. Meanwhile, the Bangu and Sokoto had developed a working relationship with the Yoruba people of Nigeria. Through this bond, they profited off of each other from the by products of their cattle and agriculture. The Fulani people would trade any commodities they extracted from their cattle to the Yoruba's for their crops. However, the migration of the Bororo Fulani shifted this relationship as they were perceived to be more aggressive than the settled Fulani. This difference was further exacerbated as they did not speak the native Yoruba language unlike the settled Fulani people who did. As the Bororo Fulani pastoralists integrated into this region the cattle they owned started damaging Yoruba farmers' crops and plants. This led to friction to become quite common among these two groups. One case that can be observed was when additional wreckage was pressed into farmers in the city of Iseyin after a group of Bororo Fulani were exiled from the city of Oyo and migrated there in 1998. Another conflict the Bororo Fulani have been involved with was in 1804 when the Fulani had a Holy War between those who identified as Muslim and resonated with the Hausas and those that were still associated with the Pagan tribes. The war took place in the northern region of Nigeria. This war led to a dichotomy of two groups of the Fulani. One group amalgamated with the Hausa people and are essentially integrated as Hausas while holding positions of wealth and power. The other group kept their pastoral ways intact and did not intermesh with any other tribes. This is what eventually became the Bororo Fulani which means the Bush or Cow Fulani. Currently, the conflict between Fulani herders and other Nigerian farmers have intensified. From 2011 to 2016, roughly 2,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced. This is partly due to the rise of jihadist groups, such as Boko Haram. Their presence has jeopardized many herders and farmers that graze in Northern Nigeria. The government has made little efforts to intervene and create schemes to alleviate this conflict. Hence, herders and farmers take it upon themselves to solve the conflicts existing within the community which invigorates conflict.  Abet Fulani Herders  The Abet, also known as the Kachichere, are another subgroup of the Fulani. They live in the Abet region of Nigeria after they migrated there in the 18th century. They live in a region for approximately 3 to 5 years before moving another few kilometers within the Abet. Once they establish a homestead, their herds graze within a 3-mile radius. The reason they prefer to graze in the Abet is due to the favorable conditions it holds for their cattle. This stems from the dry season coinciding with the peak of cow fertility and the production of milk. Furthermore, it is easier to herd animals in these open land spaces rather than in condense areas replete of bushes. For land rights in this region, Fulani families may be given rights to parts of the land through customary structures. Thus, land is distributed from Chiefs or those in charge of the villages that these fields reside in.

Background To annex the Muzaffarid kingdom Timur would have to capture its two main cities: Isfahan and Shiraz. When in 1387, Timur arrived with his army to Isfahan, It immediately surrendered and so he treated it with relative mercy as he normally did with cities that surrendered. Siege Soon after, Isfahan revolted against Timur's taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers. Timur laid siege to the city and recaptured it with little effort. Massacre of citizens After restoring his control over the city he ordered the massacre of the citizens who resisted; the death toll is reckoned to be at least 70,000. An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers constructed of about 1,500 heads each. This has been described as a \\"systematic use of terror against towns...an integral element of Tamerlane's strategic element\\" which he viewed as preventing bloodshed by discouraging resistance. His massacres were selective and he spared the artistic and educated. This would later influence the next great Persian conqueror: Nader Shah. Aftermath After the massacre Isfahan remained loyal to Timur and so he went to capture Shiraz. Unlike the events which occurred after the Siege of Herat Timur did not destroy any of the buildings and architecture allowing it retain its importance and influence in Persia.

In 1992 he was the first in the United States to perform minimally invasive aortic aneurysm surgery (stent graft procedure) together with Drs. Frank Veith, Michael L. Marin and Claudio J. Schonholz. He continues to develop new techniques, including seat belt and air bag technique for cerebral protection during carotid stenting. He is recognized as a renowned pioneer in the specialty of endovascular repairs of the aorta. Juan Parodi is also a political activist and defender of measures to alleviate poverty as well as promoter of the concept of responsible procreation and education of the most economically affected sectors in Argentina. Biography Juan Parodi was led to a career in surgery through his own interest and family influence - his uncle was a surgeon. In 1960 he began his medical training at the Universidad del Salvador, Buenos Aires, Argentina. After receiving an MD degree at the University of Salvador in 1968, Juan Parodi entered the general surgery residency in the former M. Castex Hospital which he finished in 1972. He did postgraduate fellowship at the University of Illinois at Chicago and following it did another one at the Cleveland Clinic with emphasis on vascular surgery. From 1975 to 1976 Parodi served as chief resident at the Cleveland Clinic, where Professor Alfred Humphries and Edwin Beven became two significant mentors in his career. It was during that last year 1976 that he committed all his wits to develop a new minimally invasive surgical technique that would change the future of the then infant specialty of vascular surgery and in particular aortic aneurysm surgery. The conception of Parodi's new minimally invasive technique started in 1976. It was aimed at excluding an aneurysm using a fabric graft and metal components to affix and seal these elements in position using an endovascular retrograde access. At that time, the term “metal cage with barbs” was used rather than “stent”. The engineering of the first prototypes using elastic wires of stainless steel and the experimental work took place at the Cleveland Clinic, USA. In 1979 he returned to Argentina where he continued working on the improvement of his minimally invasive surgical techniques. At that time, nobody paid attention to Parodi’s invention, which he continued to research without funding. By the mid 1980s, Parodi was having some success with his new technique in animal experiments. In 1988, Parodi met Argentinian radiologist Julio Palmaz, the inventor of the Palmaz stent, and Parodi began to use Palmaz stents in combination with his endografts on animals. From 1976 to 1990, Parodi did not receive any funding or support for his project. On 7 September 1990 Parodi made vascular surgery history with the first successful endograft procedure in the world, in the city of Buenos Aires. The first human being to be treated with Parodi’s endograft was fairly high profile – a friend of Carlos Menem, the then President of Argentina. The first device was simple, according to Parodi: “It was a graft I designed with expandable ends, the extra-large Palmaz stent, a Teflon sheath with a valve, a wire, and the valvuplasty balloon, which I took from the cardiologists.\\" Juan Parodi invited Julio Palmaz to participate in the case at the Instituto Cardiovascular de Buenos Aires. That case was a turning point in the history of vascular surgery, changing the way most patients with aneurysmal disease are treated around the world today. Despite the high profile of the patient, the procedure had little initial impact on the vascular surgery community because his initial results were rejected by the journal he submitted to. Finally in 1991 through the Annals of Vascular Surgery, the case by Juan C Parodi and Julio Palmaz became the first widely known endovascular repair (EVAR) of the aorta. In October 1992 the first EVAR case in Western Europe was done by Parodi, Claude Mialhe, Claude Amicabile and Claudio Schonholz in Nancy, France. In November 1992 Parodi was the first in the United States to perform minimally invasive aortic aneurysm surgery together with Frank Veith, Michael Marin and Claudio Schonholz. In 1995, the EVAR procedure was published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery. In 2005, Juan Parodi was celebrated as the creator of the Parodi Endograft, \\"one of the biggest innovations in the history of vascular surgery\\". When he became a professor in 1993 at Universidad del Salvador, Buenos Aires, he began traveling throughout the United States and abroad. He was a visiting professor at Stanford, New York, the University of London and the University of Tokyo. He also was an honorary professor at his alma mater, University of Buenos Aires and was a professor of surgery at Wake Forest University and Washington University in St. Louis. He is adjunct surgical research professor, University of Michigan, USA. In conjunction with the Research Chair at the University of Michigan, he undertook a work on the Argentine demographic growth, evaluating the projection of human quality in the coming years and with this base, he spoke at several conferences, which became very famous for making emphasis on the problems that hit your country hard, such as poverty and the poor education that this sector receives in Argentina. In 1980, Juan Parodi removed a gangrenous gall bladder from a poor Argentinian priest and did it without any payment. Years later, he found out who that poor priest was, Jorge Bergoglio. In 2014, Parodi and his wife was invited to visit that priest, now Pope Francis, at the Vatican and to be thanked for caring for another person without compensation.

This is however not quite correct, because the Black Jura does not exactly coincide with the chronostratigraphic boundaries of the Lower Jurassic. In addition, the term lias, which was formerly frequently used (and sometimes is today) as a synonym, should no longer be used in connexion with the South German Jurassic. Instead, the term lias, or North German Lias, should be reserved for the roughly equivalent lithostratigraphic unit in the North German Jurassic.

It opened on 3 February 1858 and closed to passengers on 18 June 1951. The line through the station closed in 1964 and has since been lifted. The station had distinctive wooden buildings on each platform with curved overhanging roofs to provide protection from inclement weather. Some other stations on the line had buildings of the same pattern. The station has been demolished. Scafell Road runs through its site. Services In July 1922 thirteen \\"Up\\" (southbound) trains called at the station on weekdays, with an extra on Saturday evenings. All originated at Ormskirk, several with connections from Southport. Ten Up trains called on Sundays. All trains continued all stations to St Helens. The \\"Down\\" (northbound) service was similar. The trains all consisted of \\"Motor Cars - One class only\\". Please note that 'Motor Cars' then did not have their modern meaning, but consisted of a single railway coach joined to a dedicated steam locomotive. Their generic type is summarised in L&YR; railmotors. Photographs appear in Bob Pixton's work on the line. In 1951 the Up service consisted of five trains on weekdays with three extra on Saturdays, all stations to St Helens. The rolling stock was \\"Third Class Only\\". No trains called on Sundays. The Down service was similar. All local trains plying between Ormskirk and St Helens called at Rainford Junction, entailing a reverse. None used the 'direct line' between Bushey Lane Junction and Randle Junction which formed the third side of the triangle shown near the top of the route diagram. That stretch was the preserve of goods trains, diversions and occasional specials. Private Sidings A siding was provided immediately south of the station for use by the Gamble Estate. It was small scale and was probably only used for agricultural traffic. It was in use in 1916 but seemed to have closed a few years later. In 1930 a siding was provided for the contractors building the nearby East Lancashire Road. It had been removed by 28 May 1934 when the road building contract had been completed.

He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the New England Patriots in 1975 and 1976 after playing college football for the USC Trojans. High school Carter had outstanding high school football career at Bonita High School, where he was considered by some observers to be one of the top high school running backs of the time. He ran for 4388 yards with 70 touchdowns during his three years on the Bonita varsity team, breaking records set by Glenn Davis in the process. Carter also participated in track and field in high school, and was the California state champion in the 100-meter dash in his junior year, running the race in 9.7 seconds. College After high school, Carter signed to play college ball at the University of Southern California. In his freshman year, Allen led the USC freshman team in rushing. But as a sophomore in 1972, he suffered leg injuries and fell behind Anthony Davis and Rod McNeill on the varsity team at tailback. Davis became the team's star tailback for the next three years, with Carter playing behind him. Carter rushed 30 times for 226 yards, a 7.5 average, that season, as USC won the National Championship. As a junior in 1973, again playing behind Davis and McNeill, Carter rushed 43 times for 294 yards, a 6.8 yard average. As a senior in 1974, Allen played behind only Davis, and rushed for 580 yards on 111 carries, a 5.2 average, helping USC to another National Championship. Allen played a key role in USC's victory in the 1975 Rose Bowl Game, rushing for 75 yards after Davis suffered a rib injury in the first half of the game. Professional career Carter was drafted by the Patriots in the 4th round with the 86th pick of the 1975 NFL draft. The Patriots had received the pick from the Cleveland Browns in exchange for wide receiver Reggie Rucker. With the Patriots he was reunited with fellow running back Sam Cunningham, who had been his fullback on the 1972 USC team. Carter was primarily a kick returner for the 1975 Patriots. He rushed only 22 times for 95 yards, a 4.3 yard average. He also caught 2 passes for 39 yards. He had a successful season as a kickoff return man, returning 32 kicks for 879 yards and a 27.5 yards per return average. His 32 returns ranked 7th in the NFL, his 879 yards ranked 6th and his 27.5 yard average ranked 3rd. In the final game of the season against the Baltimore Colts, Carter returned the opening kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown. His 99-yard return was the 2nd longest in the NFL that season. It also set a Patriots record for longest kickoff return, which was broken by Raymond Clayborn's 100 yard return in 1977. The touchdown was also enough to tie the league lead for kickoff return touchdowns for the season. In the first game of the 1976 season, Carter saw little action due to a knee injury. He returned just one kickoff for 19 yards and did not have any rushes or receptions. He was waived by the Patriots the following week and was signed by the New York Jets. He was waived by the Jets shortly thereafter. Post-retirement After his football career ended, Carter became a teacher, activities director, and assistant football coach at Anaheim High School. He later became Anaheim's varsity football head coach, during which time Carter coached future NFL running back Reuben Droughns.

The main tasks are wastewater discharge and treatment, flood protection, groundwater management, settlement of claims caused by hard coal mining, river restoration and protection of ecosystems.  History  = Origins and early development = In the North of Germany the merging of adjoining land owners along rivers and creeks in cooperatives had a long tradition from the 13th century on. In the German Rhine catchment, downstream of Cologne, the industrialization in the 19th century was leading to a renaissance of the alliance ideas. Until the middle of the 19th century the river Emscher (running from the spring close to Dortmund in western direction to the Rhine) was a small meandering lowland river of 109 km and the villages along the river had only a few thousand citizens. The improvement of steam engines and the construction of the Cologne-Minden trunk line in the 1840s enabled the economic development and the excavation of vertical mine shafts in the northern Ruhr from the 1850s on. That was resulting in severe environmental and health problems due to mining subsidence: The hard coal excavation in some hundred meters depth caused geological reactions at the surface, too. Locally, the sinking was leading over a stretch of 100 years to 30 m of mining-induced subsidence. The Emscher catchment area suffered from “subsidence funnels” where waste water, surface run-off and water from the creeks gathered and digested. From the river Ruhr (running in parallel in the south of the Emscher) water supply was installed by pumping stations to the northern cities from the 1870s on but the water carried germs and contaminations, too. Along the Emscher and its tributaries putrid smell, polluted water and flooding were not only restraining economic developments but also causing diseases and epidemics like typhus and malaria. From 1885 on legislative initiatives started to develop catchment-wide solutions and finally in 1899 the mining companies, industrial players and the Lord Mayors of the growing cities established the Emschergenossenschaft to organize the regional water drainage. In the same year the water supply was improved by the foundation of the Ruhrtalsperrenverein that was responsible for the construction and operation of drinking water basins to support the industry and citizens. The municipalities were responsible for the inner city drainage systems and interconnection points were jointly defined where the Emschergenossenschaft took over responsibility. Those were normally the sub catchment parts where underground sewer systems were impossible as the mining subsidence would have caused damages continuously and waste water would have infiltrated in groundwater and soil. In the following years – based on the Emschergenossenschaft act from 1904, a special water board act – the technical initial equipment and extension of the river and tributaries took place in the 865 km² catchment area, cutting the meanders (the Emscher was shortened from 109 km to today 81 km), deepening the runways and lining them with concrete, constructing dikes and pumping stations, relocating the Emscher mouth to guarantee downward slope and establishing waste water treatment plants. All discharge from industry, mines and households as well as rain, surface water and natural discharge were collected and drained in these new “concrete streams”. All costs were divided between the “users” of the Emscher system, depending on the volume and load of waste water or drainage capacity or causer (for example the mining companies). Between 1906 and 1914 the catchment area changed completely as in parallel to the technical transformation of the river system with 7.000 hectares drained land the shipping waterway Rhine-Herne Canal was constructed over a stretch of 46 km to connect the coal and steel district via the Rhine to the North Sea. This waterway was located partly in the former Emscher course and is often only separated by a dyke from the Emscher. Progressing coal mining aggravated environmental problems and permanent pumping and re-construction was needed since starting the initial equipment. In the 1920s the Emschergenossenschaft operated 30 waste water treatment plants but changed the system to more centralized solutions in the following years, starting 1927 with a facility in Bottrop and (after the second relocation of the Emscher mouth 1949) the development of the central treatment plant Emscher mouth in the 1970s. = Later development = The coal crisis that emerged in the 1960s was resulting in shutdown of most mines until the 1980s and as a follow-up the mining subsidence decreased and nearly stopped in the 1990s. Within the frame of the Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park from 1989 to 1999 (established as a political program for structural changes from the North Rhine-Westphalian government) the Emscher restoration was announced as a so-called lighthouse project. The Emschergenossenschaft with its administrative, political and industrial members decided to re-develop the whole Emscher system towards „second hand nature“ – a real restoration compared to the times before industrialization is impossible. The stretch was fixed for the time frame 1990 to 2020 with an investment budget of 4.5 billion €. First step was the construction respectively upgrading of 4 centralized waste water treatment plants in Dortmund, Bottrop, Duisburg and at the Emscher mouth. The second step is the construction of a 400 km waste water sewer system in parallel to the “concrete streams” and the river Emscher itself; tubes had been impossible due to mining subsidence before. Step by step compartments of the sewer system are connected to the waste water treatment plants. After connecting the tubes the remaining “concrete streams” are re-developed as a third step. The historical development has been leading to a regional system of 350 km open waste water courses within corridors, fenced and secured to prevent accidents and damage. These isolated lines are on the other hand a benefit as they now enable the Emschergenossenschaft to re-develop green belts with restored water courses in these corridors. In other metropolitan areas normally water courses had disappeared in the underground sewer system which was impossible in the Emscher catchment area. The planning process was based on catchment wide masterplan strategies and public involvement, especially for huge construction sites. The Emschergenossenschaft cooperated in many EU funded transnational projects for example on regional metropolitan park demands, with Dutch institutions on flood prevention and public participation processes,Sustainable Development of Floodplains on climate change mitigation and adaptation and with further networks on pharmaceutical residues in surface waters. The Emscher restoration programme is planned to be ready with a first basic ecological equipment until 2020.  Responsibilities  Responsibilities and tasks of the Emschergenossenschaft are defined in the act „Emschergenossenschaftsgesetz“ (Emscher GG Act Emschergenossenschaftsgesetz), enacted July 14, 1904 and adapted until 2013: * Management of runoff, flood prevention at open water courses and in the sub catchments; * Maintenance of open water courses and related facilities; * Ecological restoration of technically altered water courses; * Groundwater management; * Compensation of mining impacts on ecological or water management related changes; * Waste water disposal; * Waste disposal of waste from water management services; * Water quality management; * Scientific work related to water management challenges; * Support of drinking water supply, water for industrial use and use of hydropower The Emschergenossenschaft is working in an administrative collectivity with the Lippeverband, a water board established in 1926 in a neighboring river catchment area. Together, more than 1.500 employees work for both water boards, around 900 of them belong to the Emschergenossenschaft. Both public water boards together are the biggest water management and service provider in Germany.  Governance  The North Rhine-Westphalian water boards are statutory bodies, working in public-private partnership as non-profit institutions. The Emschergenossenschaft has an administration that is governed by a board of 3 managing directors, elected for 5 years each. The election happens on the level of associates that have representatives in an annual assembly, coming from * 19 municipalities, * 170 commercial and infrastructure companies and * 9 mining companies. The number of representatives per member depends on the number of citizens in the 19 municipalities and on the volume of waste water “produced” by the companies and mines. The supervisory authority is the Ministry for Climate Protection, Environment, Agriculture, Conservation and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (MKULNV). German water boards are not formal authorities but have to receive permissions and approvals for construction works etc. They are independent in financial and internal management but depend on regulatory decrees regarding water acts.  Catchment area  The Emschergenossenschaft is working in the 865 km² catchment area of the Emscher with the municipalities (from east to west) * Holzwickede * Dortmund * Small parts of Witten, Waltrop and Lünen * Castrop-Rauxel * Recklinghausen * Herten * Herne * Bochum * Essen * Mülheim * Gelsenkirchen * Gladbeck * Bottrop * Oberhausen * Duisburg * Dinslaken * Voerde The catchment is historically divided since cutting the Emscher main stream from its original estuary twice, first in 1906 from the original mouth in Duisburg and 1949 again by shifting the mouth to Dinslaken. The former parts of the catchment area in Duisburg and Oberhausen are drained artificially and the waste water is – after treatment – pumped into the river Rhine. These sub catchments are called “Alte Emscher” and “Kleine Emscher”. The third shift of the Emscher mouth (under construction 2014-2018) has been leading to the municipality of Voerde as a new member in the Emschergenossenschaft.

The Avenida leads from the Jardines del Real in the west to the Poblats Marítims in the east. Plans to extend the Avenida to the sea have existed for a long time, but have not been realized. History Originally envisioned as a jardin street under the name of \\"camino-paseo hasta el mar\\" the project was approved by law on 1 August 1893. The aim of the street was to link the Jardines del Real in the west to the Poblats Marítims in the east of the city. A first design was made by Casimiro Meseguer who intended to make the street part of a green city plan he called \\"Ciudad Jardín\\". Meseguer finished his plan in 1895. It was made with the bourgeoisie in mind, with villas for the rich directly on the avenue and less expensive houses behind it. Meseguer's design gave the street a width of 100 meters and included three large plazas with a diameter of 200 meters. A central part of the street would be a 60-meter wide gardened stretch, streets ending on the camino would have a width of 20 meters. However, the plans were cancelled due to the projected high costs and the Avenida was constructed differently. It became part of the growth of the city to the north-east and the sea and in line with the practice of ensanche. The first part of the Avenida has a 50-meter wide gardened stretch. A second part, leading to the Avenida de Cataluña, was finished in 1952. Construction on the third and currently final part started in 1972 and leads to the Cabanyal metro station. Although the Avenida was constructed differently than originally designed, Meseguer's ideas, however, remained popular throughout the 20th- century and were defended by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez. The Avenida de Blasco Ibañez obtained its current name in 1977, previously it had been called: calle número 141 del plano; Unión Soviética; Vía Triunfal; Paseo Valencia al Mar and Paseo al Mar. Extension to sea The University of Valencia's Rectorate Plans to extend the Avenida to the sea have existed for decades but have not been realized. In 2010 the Spanish ministry of Culture blocked the plans of the city of Valencia to extend the Avenida and kept the protection of Bien de Interés Cultural of the Cabanyal neighborhood. In 2014 Valencia mayor Rita Barberá announced that the Plan Especial de Protección y Reforma Interior (Pepri) del Cabanyal-Canyamelar would go on, including an expansion of the Avenida to the sea. The Pepri plan is controversial due to an expected destruction of homes in the Cabanyal neighborhood. Buildings The University of Valencia has several of its faculties located on the Avenida de Blasco Ibañez. Due to the presence of students the Avenida de Blasco Ibañez is known as one of the nightlife areas of Valencia.

Kidd died in 1874 before the house was completed and was unable to see his fine new house finished. Soon after the house was finished, a dam forming a pond was built below the Glenternie Burn. The house was then occupied by his two sisters, Miss Pringle Kidd, and Miss Elizabeth. Pringle Kidd died in 1902 at the age of 96. The house was sold in 1903 for £17,300 to Thomas Inglis, the proprietor of Bonnington Flour Mills in Edinburgh. He introduced the Belgian Hare to the Parish. He was succeeded by his brother, John, owner of John Inglis (shipbuilder), a well known shipbuilder situated in Glasgow. John died in 1922. The house was empty for 30 years. After this in 1952, it was sold to the Wolfe-Murray family, then the Morrow family. The Woodd family have been living at Glenternie since 1998. http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=200683 http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst18739.html References External links * Glenternie House - official site Category:Country houses in the Scottish Borders Category:Category B listed buildings in the Scottish Borders ","title":"Glenternie House"},{"id":"47769987","text":"Walter Scott (23 June 1932 — 6 June 1988) was a Scottish footballer, who played for Falkirk, Hamilton Academical, Dumbarton and Halifax Town.More Douglas Players  Walter 'Attie' Scott, A History of Football in Douglasdale], 12 July 2009 References Category:1932 births Category:Scottish footballers Category:Falkirk F.C. players Category:Hamilton Academical F.C. players Category:Dumbarton F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:1988 deaths Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Halifax Town A.F.C. players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Sportspeople from South Lanarkshire ","title":"Walter Scott (footballer, born 1932)"},{"id":"47769991","text":"Lindsay Davenport and Mary Joe Fernández were scheduled to play Tracy Austin and Gigi Fernández in the final.

The Institute was founded in 1981 by a group of food industry professionals and enthusiasts, including Julia Child and Robert Mondavi. Today, the organization includes educational programs, a bimonthly publication titled Savor This, and local chapters across the United States.Robert Mondavi Institute of Wine and Food Science Building at UC Davis in Davis, California Mission On their website, the group aims to further “the understanding, appreciation and quality of wine and food through fun educational experiences.” The AIWF implements these goals by awarding scholarships to culinary programs, organizing lessons about food and health for schoolchildren, and hosting community events. History The initial concept for the AIWF was led in 1979 by John Ronsheim, as a university gastronomy program. Ronsheim recruited 57 culinary experts to advise in the program’s development including Julia Child, James Beard, Robert Mondavi, Jeremiah Tower, Alice Waters, and Barbara Kafka. In the following years, Ronsheim coordinated efforts to find a host university and investors for the program. In 1981, the Institute was officially formed after funding a special collection of books on the culinary arts in an agreement with the University of California at Santa Barbara. Richard Graff was the first president. The organization began to hold conferences and dinners which address topics such as sustainable eating and the benefits of local ingredients. The first of these was The Conference of Gastronomy held in New York City in 1985. The AIWF also began publishing an academic journal, The Journal of Gastronomy, to highlight emerging and relevant research. The journal was published from 1984 to 1991. The Institute eventually began local chapters across the United States, and today there are 13 regional chapters. The AIWF also currently sponsors special collections at the University of California at San Diego and at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.

It opened on 1 August 1906http://www.disused- stations.org.uk/o/old_mill_lane/index.shtml and closed on 18 June 1951. The line through the station closed in 1964 and has since been lifted. The station has been demolished. Services In July 1922 thirteen \\"Up\\" (southbound) trains called at the station on weekdays, with an extra on Saturday evenings. All originated at Ormskirk, several with connections from Southport. Ten Up trains called on Sundays. All trains continued all stations to St Helens. The \\"Down\\" (northbound) service was similar. The trains all consisted of \\"Motor Cars - One class only\\". Please note that 'Motor Cars' then did not have their modern meaning, but consisted of a single railway coach joined to a dedicated steam locomotive. Their generic type is summarised in L&YR; railmotors. Photographs appear in Bob Pixton's work on the line. In 1951 the Up service consisted of five trains on weekdays with three extra on Saturdays, all stations to St Helens. The rolling stock was \\"Third Class Only\\". No trains called on Sundays. The Down service was similar. All local trains plying between Ormskirk and St Helens called at Rainford Junction, entailing a reverse. None used the 'direct line' between Bushey Lane Junction and Randle Junction which formed the third side of the triangle shown near the top of the route diagram. That stretch was the preserve of goods trains, diversions and occasional specials. Private Sidings To modern eyes a surprising amount of industry was once served by the railway at Old Mill Lane, the scale can be gauged in the aerial photographs in the Disused Railways website linked below. Rainford Pottery was served by a siding from 1868 until the 1950s when the traffic was lost to road. Pilkington's had two sidings, a yard turning northeast from south of the station and a siding to Rainford Sand Wash running parallel to the tracks just north of the station. Sand was a key ingredient in St Helens' glassmaking industry. This sand wash was served over the years by narrow gauge railways, aerial ropeways and lorries.

Construction of the building started in 1881 and was funded by the son of Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, Semyon Mikhailovich who recently returned from the 1877-78 Russo- Turkish War. The construction of the palace that was initially designed by French architect Étienne Bouchard in the Louis XIII style was soon suspended after the death of Prince Semyon Mikhailovich Vorontsov. In 1889 the unfinished palace was bought by the Russian Imperial Domains Agency for Alexander III of Russia. The new owner commissioned his favorite architect Maximilian Messmacher to modernize the villa's design. Although Massandra was listed among imperial residences, no royals ever stayed there over night (rather preferring the neighboring Livadia Palace). After the October Revolution and before World War II, the residence was used as a government sanatorium \\"Proletarian Health\\" for people ill with tuberculosis. After World War II it was used as a state cottage (dacha) under the name \\"Stalinskaya\\". After the fall of the Soviet Union, Massandra Palace was used as one of the Ukrainian official residences where were signed the Massandra Accords in 1993. In 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea, the residence was taken over by the Russian Presidential Affairs Administration. A bust of Alexander III was unveiled in front of the villa in 2017.

The mission of AoU is to accelerate health and medical breakthroughs, enabling individualized prevention, treatment and care from all of us. The project aims to collect genetic and health data from one million volunteers. The initiative was announced during the 2015 State of the Union Address, and is run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The founding program director was Eric Dishman, who stepped down to become the Chief Innovation Officer. In 2019, Joshua Denny was selected to be the second director. In October 2016, the project was renamed \\"All of Us\\". The research program was launched for national enrollment on May 6, 2018. The Program is currently bilingual, with information and materials available in Spanish and English. Additional languages will be added in the future.  Core Values  A set of All of Us core values are guiding the development and implementation of the All of Us Research Program: * Participation is open to all. * Participants reflect the rich diversity of the U.S. * Participants are partners. * Trust will be earned through transparency. * Participants have access to their information. * Data will be accessed broadly for research purposes. * Security and privacy will be of the highest importance. * The program will be a catalyst for positive change in research.  What Data is Collected When you sign up for the All of Us Research Program, you are asked to take a survey that gathers information about your lifestyle and environment. Participants in All of Us can choose to give researchers access to their electronic health records (EHR), which includes information about their individual health problems and treatment they have received. They may also be asked to provide blood and urine samples and your physical measurements. Participants may also share data gathered by wearable devices (Fitbit) and in the future be asked to participate in clinical trials. Program leaders plan to capture genomic data from select participants in 2019.  Who Can Enroll  Eligible adults (18 and over) can enroll with the program. People who are not eligible are those in prison or people who cannot consent on their own According to a sample consent form released in June 2018, participation in All of Us is voluntary and does not affect a participant's medical care. The form explains that if a participant quits the program, their samples will be destroyed.[16] Children may also be able to enroll in the program.[14] By January 2018 an initial pilot project had enrolled about 10,000 people and 2022 was targeted for one million people. As of May 2019, enrollment numbers at 1-year launch anniversary are 187,000+ participants, with more than 132,000 who have given biosamples. The NIH reported in May 2018 that they were pleased with high enrollment by underrepresented groups including communities of color and individuals with lower incomes. Up to three-quarters of beta phase participants came from those communities.  Program Partners  All of Us has more than 100 partners and champions working together to implement and support the mission and goals of the research program. Google life sciences startup Verily Life Sciences, a Google \\"moonshot\\" with a goal of \\"transform[ing] the way we detect, prevent, and manage disease\\" is one partner. The initiative was identified by a 2019 review as involving the public in every stage of the research.  Program Budget  The All of Us Research Program budget has increase every year since it launched: FY2016 - $130 million; FY2017 - $230 million; and FY2018 - $290 million.  Responses to the Initiative Professor Kenneth Weiss from Pennsylvania State University, in a skeptical review of this project in 2017, suggested that the funding could be better spent elsewhere. Program Progress = Enrollment = In the summer of 2019, one year after its official launch, All of Us had enrolled 230,000 participants, which represents almost one quarter of the program's goal of 1,000,000 individuals. Approximately 80% of those people are from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. One of All of US's main goals is to include many people from diverse ancestries.https://www.clinicalomics.com/news-and-features/one-year-after- launch-nihs-all-of-us-hits-key-milestones/ By June 2020, enrollment reached approximately 350,000 individuals. = All of Us Researcher Workbench = On May 27, 2020, the All of Us research program announced the launch of their research platform, the All of Us Researcher Workbench, for beta testing. Select data collected by the initiative, including electronic health records and survey responses from the first 225,000 program participants, will be available to approved researchers through the workbench. Researchers may apply for access to the data if they have an NIH eRA Commons account (for identity verification) and are affiliated with an institution that has signed a data use agreement with All of Us. = Response to COVID-19 Pandemic = In June 2020, the NIH announced that research materials collected as part of the All of Us initiative will be used to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Blood samples collected from recent volunteers will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in order to track prior infections within the US population. Electronic health records shared by All of Us participants will also be evaluated for potential patterns associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All of Us also added monthly participant surveys with questions about the physical, mental, and socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

History The first station opened in 1858 and closed in March 1862. A second station of the same name opened on a site a short distance further north on 1 June 1865. The station had distinctive wooden buildings on each platform with curved overhanging roofs to provide protection from inclement weather. Some other stations on the line had buildings of the same pattern. The second station closed on 18 June 1951. Goods trains continued to pass through the station site until 6 July 1964 when the line north of Mill Lane was closed and lifted. Both Rookery stations have been demolished. Services In July 1922 thirteen \\"Up\\" (southbound) trains called at the station on weekdays, with an extra on Saturday evenings. All originated at Ormskirk, several with connections from Southport. Ten Up trains called on Sundays. All trains continued all stations to St Helens. The \\"Down\\" (northbound) service was similar. The trains all consisted of \\"Motor Cars - One class only\\". Please note that 'Motor Cars' then did not have their modern meaning, but consisted of a single railway coach joined to a dedicated steam locomotive. Their generic type is summarised in L&YR; railmotors. Photographs appear in Bob Pixton's work on the line. In 1951 the Up service consisted of five trains on weekdays with three extra on Saturdays, all stations to St Helens. The rolling stock was \\"Third Class Only\\". No trains called on Sundays. The Down service was similar. All local trains plying between Ormskirk and St Helens called at Rainford Junction, entailing a reverse. None used the 'direct line' between Bushey Lane Junction and Randle Junction which formed the third side of the triangle shown near the top of the route diagram. That stretch was the preserve of goods trains, diversions and occasional specials.

Tom yum has its origin in Thailand. The words \\"tom yam\\" are derived from two Thai words. Tom refers to the boiling process, while yam means 'mixed'. Tom yum is characterised by its distinct hot and sour flavours, with fragrant spices and herbs generously used in the broth. The soup is also made with fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed red chili peppers. Commercial tom yum paste is made by crushing all the herb ingredients and stir frying in oil. Then, seasoning and other preservative ingredients are added. The paste is bottled or packaged and sold around the world. Tom yum flavored with the paste may have different characteristics from that made with fresh herb ingredients. The soup often includes meats such as shrimp, chicken, or pork. Preparation The taste of tom yum is based on sour and spicy flavors. A paste called nam prik pao is prepared as a base of the soup, to which water, herbs and meat are added. The nam prik pao is made from roasted chilies, shallots, and garlic and the ingredients are best grilled on a charcoal fire. The basic ingredient of tom yum is shrimp or pork. The most popular tom yum base is river shrimp called tom yum goong. The essential ingredients of tom yum are herbs such as lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves. Other ingredients are also important, especially Thai chilies, mushroom, coriander leaf (cilantro), tomatoes, sweet white onions, lime juice, sugar, and fish sauce. Tom yum nam khon is a variety with coconut milk or evaporated milk. Selected types Tom yam kung maphrao on nam khon, as served in Uttaradit, Thailand Ready-to-use bundles of lemon grass, galangal, lime leaves, and, for chicken tom yam, also turmeric, are sold at Thai markets *Tom yam nam sai (), clear broth tom yam soup *Tom yam nam khon () is a more recent variation from the 1980s. common with prawns as a main ingredient, evaporated milk or non- dairy creamer powder is added to the broth as a finishing touch. *Tom yam kathi () – coconut milk-based tom yum—this is often confused with tom kha kai (\\"chicken galanga soup\\"), where galangal is the dominant flavour of the coconut milk-based soup. *tom yam kung () – the version of the dish most popular among tourists, is made with prawns as the main ingredient. The dish originated during the Rattanakosin Kingdom. *Tom yam pla () is a clear fish soup that was traditionally eaten with rice. It used to be the most widespread form of tom yam before mass-tourism came to Thailand, for fresh fish is readily available almost everywhere in the region's rivers, canals and lakes as well as in the sea. Usually fish with firm flesh that doesn't crumble after boiling is preferred for this type of soup. *Tom yam gai () is the chicken version of the soup. *Tom yam po taek () or tom yam thale () is a variant of the soup with mixed seafood, like prawns, squid, clams and pieces of fish. *Tom yam kung maphrao on nam khon (), a version of prawn tom yum with the meat of a young coconut and a dash of (coconut) milk. *Tom yam kha mu (), made with pork leg. These require a long cooking time under low fire. In the modern popularized versions the soup contains also mushrooms—usually straw mushrooms or oyster mushrooms. The soup is often topped with generous sprinkling of fresh chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). Sometimes Thai chili jam (nam phrik phao, ) is added: this gives the soup a bright orange color and makes the chili flavor more pronounced. Other spicy and sour soups Less well known outside Thailand is tom khlong (ต้มโคล้ง), a spicy sour soup where the sourness, however, does not derive from lime juice but through the use of tamarind. Tom som () are soups that are also very similar to tom yum but most often do not contain lemongrass or kaffir lime leaves. Depending on the type of tom som, the acidity can be derived from lime juice or from the use of tamarind.

In Thai cuisine these are called yam, tam, lap and phla. A few additional dishes can also be regarded as being a salad. Overview Thai salads often do not have raw vegetables or fruit as their main ingredient but use minced meat, seafood or noodles instead. Similar to salads in the West, these dishes often have a souring agent, usually lime juice, and feature the addition of fresh herbs and other greens in their preparation. Thai salads are not served as entrées but normally eaten as one of the main dishes in a Thai buffet-style meal, together with rice (depending on the region this can be glutinous rice or non-glutinous rice) or the Thai rice noodle called khanom chin. Specialised khao tom kui (plain rice congee) restaurants also serve a wide variety of Thai salads of the yam type as side dishes. Many Thai salads, for instance the famous som tam, are also eaten as a meal or snack on their own. Varieties =Yam= Yam khamin khao kung Yam (, ) literally means \\"mix\\" but in Thai cuisine it normally refers to a type of salad-like dishes in the culinary repertoire of Thailand. Yam can be made with a wide variety of ingredients as its main ingredient and nearly any type of protein, vegetable, fruit, herb, spice, and noodle, or combinations thereof, is possible. The main ingredient can be raw, pickled, fermented, sun-dried, smoked, steamed, parboiled, boiled, grilled, baked, stir-fried or deep-fried, or combinations thereof. Besides the main ingredient, the basic recipe of a yam will nearly always contain sliced fresh shallots or onions, fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and fresh or dried chillies. When herbs are used, it is usually Chinese celery, sometimes in combination with other fresh herbs such as spearmint, coriander leaves, spring onions and culantro.http://www.thaicookbook.tv/thai-food-ingredients/fresh-herbs-and- spices/culantro-phak-chi-farang/ Very often, sliced tomatoes are also added in, or finely sliced fresh spices such as lemongrass, ginger, galangal, or khamin khao (lit. \\"white turmeric\\"). Yam pla duk fu, with the green mango dressing in a bowl on the side Examples of yam style salads are yam nuea yang with sliced grilled beef, yam khai dao with fried egg, yam tale with mixed seafood, yam mu yo with a pork sausage resembling liverwurst, or yam wunsen with glass noodles. Some yam salads can use only herbs, spices and nuts as their main ingredient, such as yam takhrai met mamuang himaphan with sliced lemongrass and cashew nuts, or with stir-fried vegetables, such as water mimosa in yam phak krachet. Depending on the salad, anything from crispy fried onions, crunchy nuts or seeds, to toasted coconut flakes can also be added to the mix to enhance the flavours, colours and textures. Also, in many yam salads where the main ingredient is not meat, cooked minced pork can be added for extra savouriness, as often happens in yam wunsen (glass noodle salad). After one look at the menu of a khao tom kui (plain rice congee) restaurant, it is clear that nearly any ingredient that one can imagine can be used to make a yam style salad. To name a few: yam khai khem (salted duck eggs), yam kung chiang (dry Chinese sweet pork sausage), yam mu krop (Chinese crispy pork), and yam phak kat dong (Chinese pickled cabbage). These yam that are eaten with plain rice congee tend to remain more simple in their preparation, containing only the basic \\"dressing\\" of lime juice, raw onion or shallot, chillies, sugar and fish sauce in addition to the main ingredient, with only some celery added where needed.Salad of White Turmeric, Salted Prawns and Pork, ThaiFoodMaster.com, 5 November 2010.Yam Mu Yaw (Spicy Northern-style Pork Sausage Salad), Tam Ra Ahan Thai (Thai Recipes), Clay's Kitchen, received 4 November 2013.Spicy Chinese Sausage Salad – Yam Kun Chiang, She Simmers: Thai Home Cooking, 27 July 2009.Thai Green Mango Salad with Grilled Shrimp and Cashews, She Simmers: Thai Home Cooking, 9 February 2011.Spicy Salad of Boiled Pork Sausage, She Simmers: Thai Home Cooking, 9 August 2011. A few types of yam need special mention as they differ somewhat from the basic recipe as mentioned above: *Yam naem khao thot (also known as naem khluk) is a salad made from crushed, deep-fried ball-shaped croquettes made from sticky rice and curry paste as the main ingredient, tossed together with shredded fermented pork sausage, and mixed with peanuts, crushed dried chillies, lime juice, sliced shallots and fresh herbs, and served with a selection of fresh greens and additional herbs on the side.Naem Khao Tod by Spoon Thai Restaurant, Chicago, She Simmers: Thai Home Cooking, 26 September 2011. *Yam thawai is an elaborate salad made with chicken and a wide selection of vegetables, such as banana flowers, eggplant, string beans, bamboo shoots and bean sprouts, blanched briefly in coconut milk, and then served together with a creamy curry-like dressing.Thai Salad of Chicken and Seven Vegetables Blanched in Coconut Milk and Served With Sour-Salty and Sweet Coconut Curry Dressing, Crispy Fried Shallots and Roasted Sesame Seeds, ThaiFoodMaster.com, 8 February 2011. *Yam pla duk fu or pla duk fu yam mamuang is deep-fried flaked catfish meat served with a dressing made with thinly sliced unripe mango, shallots, chillies, lime juice, sugar and fish sauce.Yam Pla Duk Fu (Crispy Catfish Green Mango Salad), Tam Ra Ahan Thai (Thai Recipes), Clay's Kitchen, received 4 November 2013. * Yam kung ten or just kung ten is a salad made with very small translucent freshwater shrimp. The novelty of this dish is that a spicy lime dressing is first placed at the bottom of a bowl, which is then filled to the brim with the live shrimp and closed off with a lid. When the lid is opened by an unsuspecting dinner guest, some of the small wriggling shrimp jump out of the bowl. Kung ten literally means \\"dancing shrimp\\". Shaking the bowl mixes the live shrimp with the sour dressing which kills them.Yam Kung Ten (\\"Dancing\\" Shrimp Salad), Tam Ra Ahan Thai (Thai Recipes), Clay's Kitchen, received 4 November 2013 * Northern Thai yam do not follow the usual Thai yam dressing in that they tend not to be sour at all. Many are soup-like in appearance and resemble cold vegetable, meat or fish stews. They are made similarly to a salad, by combining the separate (cold) ingredients into one dish together with fresh herbs. Very often a sauce made from boiled fermented fish is used as a flavouring. * Yam som o, a yam made with pomelo, can utilise a different dressing altogether than a standard yam. As the pomelo, being a citrus fruit, is already naturally tart, the dressing can be sweet and/or creamy. It is therefore that recipes often make use of palm sugar, tamarind and coconut milk to complement the taste of the pomelo.Pomelo Salad, ThaiFoodMaster.com, 4 May 2009. * Yam salat is commonly used to denote Western salads in Thai, usually to refer to salads that use mayonnaise in the dressing.Spicy Tuna Salad (Yum Salad Tuna), KitchenAholics, 27 November 2011. *Yam maeng da is made from grilled horseshoe crab and only the eggs are eaten. It has a nutty and strong fishy taste. =Tam= Northern Thai tam som o The most famous, and for many also the original, tam (, ), lit. \\"pounded\\") style salad is som tam, made from unripe papaya. The basic dressing for a som tam- style salad contains garlic, palm sugar, lime juice, bird's-eye chillies, dried shrimp and fish sauce. This dressing is slightly pounded and mixed together inside an earthenware mortar using a wooden pestle. With certain kinds of tam, some or all of the additional ingredients will also be pounded slightly if this helps to release the flavours. Though with dishes such as tam phonla mai (fruit) or tam mu yo (a sausage similar to liverwurst), the main ingredients are simply mixed in with the dressing. Many types of tam salads will also contain (sliced) tomatoes.Fruit Som Tam: Som Tam Pon La Mai, She Simmers: Thai Home Cooking, 20 December 2009. Northern Thai tam are quite different altogether. Most of these dishes do not use any lime or tamarind juice, nor any vinegar in their dressing, thereby lacking the sour element seen in many salads. Tam makhuea for instance, is made from mashed grilled eggplant, grilled shallots and garlic, roasted chillies, fish and shrimp paste and served with mint and boiled egg. It is somewhat similar to other eggplant salads from around the world such as baba ghanoush. Further removed from what would still be viewed as a salad in the West, is the northern Thai tam khanun, made with mashed boiled whole baby jackfruit, dried chillies, minced pork stir-fried with a chilli paste, cherry tomatoes, fresh kaffir lime leaves, and coriander leaves. Another traditional salad from northern Thailand is tam khai mot daeng, made with the eggs of the red ant. Phak phai (Vietnamese mint) is one of the more unusual herbs used in this salad. A tam style salad from northern Thailand that is also famous in the rest of Thailand, is tam som-o (pomelo salad), in which the slightly pounded flesh of a pomelo is mixed with garlic, sliced lemongrass, and a thick pungent black paste (nam pu) made from boiling down the juices and meat of rice-paddy crabs. =Lap= Lap mu Isan Lap or larb (, ) is one of the internationally most well-known salads from Laos. The spicy, sweet and very tart style of lap from Laos and northeastern Thailand is made with a dressing of lime juice, fish sauce, ground dried chillies, sugar and, very importantly, khao khua, ground dry roasted glutinous rice which gives this salad its specific nutty flavour. Coriander leaves and chopped spring onions finish off the dish. Lap is most commonly made with minced pork or minced chicken, but in Thailand, lap pla, with fish, is also popular. Nam tok is a derivative of lap where the meat is sliced and not minced. Northern Thai lap is a very different type of dish. As with the northern Thai tam, no souring agent is used in these dishes. Especially the versions using stir-fried minced meat (lap khua) more resemble a \\"normal\\" meat dish than a salad; but, as with salads, different ingredients, including fresh herbs and spices, are freshly mixed together to form the dish. Other versions of this northern Thai speciality use raw meat or fish.Lap kai, Lanna Food, Chiang Mai University. =Phla= Phla kung Phla (, ) style salads can be made with a variety of proteins but not thoroughly cooked (rare to medium). Popularly used are pork (phla mu), prawns (phla kung) or beef (phla nuea). The basic dressing is very much the same as a yam but with a difference. In addition to the fish sauce, lime juice, chillies, and shallots or onions, a phla style salad will also always contain large amounts of thinly sliced lemongrass and mint. Additional fresh herbs, such as coriander leaves, can also be added to the mix. Some versions are made with grilled pork or beef,พล่าหมูย่าง (Spicy Pork Salad), NuiHome.com, 2 September 2008. other versions will also have nam phrik phao, a sweet roasted chilli paste, mixed in with the dressing. This last version is popular with squid (phla pla muek) and with prawns.Phla Pla Muek (Spicy Squid Salad), Tam Ra Ahan Thai (Thai Recipes), Clay's Kitchen, received 4 November 2013. =Others= The following dishes can also be regarded as salads: *Khanom chin sao nam is a kind of noodle salad using fresh Thai rice noodles called khanom chin, mixed in with thick coconut milk, chopped pineapple, garlic, bird's-eye chillies, ginger \\"au julienne\\", lime juice, fish sauce, and pounded dried shrimp.ขนมจีนซาวน้ำ - A Piquant Ambrosia, Ohsirin: Eating Out Loud, 15 April 2011. *Mu kham wan or mu manao is a salad-like dish of sliced grilled pork over which a spicy and very sweet dressing made with lime juice, garlic, bird's-eye chillies, sugar and fish sauce is poured. This dressing is basically a generic Thai nam chim (lit. \\"dipping sauce\\").Mu Manao (Spicy Pork with Lime), Tam Ra Ahan Thai (Thai Recipes), Clay's Kitchen, received 4 November 2013. It is often served sprinkled with mint leaves and served together with thinly sliced raw Chinese broccoli which are made extra crispy by serving the sliced vegetable on a bed of ice. *Sa are salad-like dishes from northern Thailand which can use a similar chilli and spice paste as the northern Thai lap, but with sliced raw shallots and garlic added into the dish. Two of the numerous variations are sa phli, which is made with uncooked sliced banana flowers, and sa chin, with sliced raw buffalo meat.Sa chin, Lanna Food, Chiang Mai University. Sa taengkwa however, which is made with cucumber, doesn't use the lap spice mix but instead a mix of shrimp paste, roasted fermented soy bean and boiled fermented fish. *Achat is the Thai version of the Malay and Indonesian pickle called acar. Where the original acar can be made with a whole range of vegetables, the Thai versions are limited to cucumber. Achat is often served in a small dish as a dipping sauce for sate, thot man pla (spicy Thai fish cakes), and popia thot (deep-fried spring rolls). Taengkwa priao wan is a similar salad-like cucumber pickle.Achat (Cucumber Pickle), Tam Ra Ahan Thai (Thai Recipes), Clay's Kitchen, received 4 November 2013. *Sup no mai (lit. \\"bamboo-shoot salad\\") is a salad made by first boiling bamboo shoots, ya nang leaf juice and other ingredients together, after which the resulting salad is mixed with fresh herbs, sliced onions and dried chillies.Bamboo Salad: Soup No Mai, Joy's Thai Food, 2 November 2007. *Khao yam pak tai (ข้าวยำปักษ์ใต้, lit. \\"southern Thai mixed rice\\") is one of the staples of southern Thailand. It comes in many versions but the basic recipe for the most widespread variation involves mixing cold cooked rice with pieces or slices of unripe mango or pomelo, dried shrimp, budu sauce, bean sprouts, toasted coconut flakes, sliced lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. Sometimes lime juice is added for additional tartness.Southern Thai Rice Salad – Khao Yam (ข้าวยำ), She Simmers: Thai Home Cooking, 28 February 2011. *Miang kham are small \\"salad\\" parcels made with the fresh peppery leaf of the chaphlu wrapped around a filling of toasted coconut, chopped lime, bird's-eye chillies, shallots and ginger, which has been topped with a sweet and savoury sauce made from palm sugar and fish sauce. Variations include additional ingredients for the filling such as dried shrimp, roasted peanuts, fried fish or meat, sliced lemongrass, and alternative ingredients for the sauce such as tamarind, shrimp paste and galangal. These bite sized parcels are often eaten as a snack or appetizer.Thai Appetizer - Miang Kham Recipe: Tasty Thai Leaf-wrapped Tidbits, Templeofthai.com, received 4 November 2013.Thai Food Recipe: Miang Kham (Wild Betel Leaf Wraps) Joy's Thai Food, 28 August 2011. * Nam tok mu is made with grilled pork, chili powder, chopped shallots, ground roasted rice and lime juice. Although not really a salad as it doesn't involve mixing ingredients into a specific dish, the Thai tradition of serving a selection of fresh and boiled greens (often vegetables but also raw tree leaves, steamed mushrooms, or cooked pumpkin) together with a saucer or bowl of nam phrik (Thai chilli paste), fits one of the usual characteristics of a salad, being cold vegetables with a \\"sauce\\" as an accompaniment to a meal.

Gerrish catalog dated 1898 E.H. Gerrish (1847-1930) is credited with being the first person to sell wood-canvas canoes commercially. From 1882-1909, Gerrish built and sold canoes from a shop in Bangor, Maine. Early Gerrish canoes contain elements of the birchbark canoes upon which they were based. If studied from earliest-to-latest, the canoes of E.H. Gerrish appear to show the morphing of the wood-canvas from its roots in the birch bark to the modern open gunwale canoe. History Gerrish canoe with classic heart- shaped deck Evan Hughes “Eve” Gerrish is credited with being the first person to sell wood-canvas canoes commercially.Stelmok, Jerry and Rollin Thurlow, The Wood & Canvas Canoe: A Complete Guide to its History, Construction, Restoration, and Maintenance,The Harpwell Press, 1997, p.24.Jennings, John, The Canoe: A Living Tradition, Firefly Books Ltd., 2002, p.208. Born in Brownville, Maine, in 1847, Eve Gerrish was an established hunting and fishing guide when he moved to Bangor in 1875, set up shop manufacturing fishing rods and canoe paddles and began experimenting with wood-canvas canoe construction.Stelmok, Jerry and Rollin Thurlow, The Wood & Canvas Canoe: A Complete Guide to its History, Construction, Restoration, and Maintenance, The Harpwell Press, 1997, p.24. Canvas had been used to patch leaks in bark canoes, and native people had experimented with the use of canvas in canoe- building as the supply of usable birch bark became depleted with the rise in interest in use of the canoe for sporting activities.Stelmok, Jerry and Rollin Thurlow, The Wood & Canvas Canoe: A Complete Guide to its History, Construction, Restoration, and Maintenance, The Harpwell Press, 1997, pp.21-22. These early canvas-covered canoes were built without metal fastenings and, as with bark canoes, they were built from the outside-in—the reverse of the later practice of building over a form or mold.Wooden Canoe Number 21, Winter 1985, p.14. By 1878, Gerrish was producing eighteen canoes a year and by 1882 hired his first employee. In 1884 he was producing over 50 canoes annually. That year, Gerrish exhibited his canoes in New Orleans at the World Cotton Centennial.Stelmok, Jerry and Rollin Thurlow, The Wood & Canvas Canoe: A Complete Guide to its History, Construction, Restoration, and Maintenance, The Harpwell Press, 1997, p.25. As the advantages of the canvas covered canoe became evident to a public interested in a replacement for the more difficult to obtain and maintain bark canoe, others entered the canoe- building market and contributed to the advancement of the manufacturing process.

An economic depression known as the Panic of 1893 may have worked to the advantage of canvas canoe builders such as Gerrish: wooden boat builder J.H. Rushton nearly went bankrupt after investing in the promotion of his boats at this event,Manley, Atwood, Rushton and His Times in American Canoeing, The Adirondack Museum/Syracuse University Press, 1968, pp.128-129 while the less expensive and easily maintained canvas canoe continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1890s. Gerrish continued to build canoes until retiring in 1909 at the age of 62, selling the company to his foreman, Herbert Walton. Walton moved the company to his hometown of Costigan, Maine, where he continued to use the Gerrish name on his canoes but changed the name tag to reflect the new location of Costigan. Production of the canoes slowly declined until the shop finally closed around 1930.

Among surviving examples, it is unusual to find any two that are completely alike. WCHA Forums, KnowledgeBase, Manufacturers: E.H. Gerrish, Identification Features, accessed September 9, 2015. *Initially, it is likely Gerrish produced canvas canoes built in the manner of the birch bark, without the use of a form, although no examples are known to survive. While his system of building canvas canoes evolved to employ European boat building methods, Gerrish incorporated a nod to the Native-built canoe when he used cane to simulate spruce root lashings and carrying devices. This is seen on canoes presumed to be pre-1900. WCHA Forums, KnowledgeBase, Manufacturers: E.H. Gerrish, Identification Features, accessed September 9, 2015.

The awards ceremony has been held annually since 1952. Each winner is presented with a golden statue and in recent years also a cash prize. History The awards were first introduced in 1952, and the ceremony has been held annually since 1952 (apart from 1963, 1986, 1987, and 1988). In the first awards ceremony, only three kinds of awards (Best Film, Best Actor and Best Actress) were presented. In the beginning, second and third place prizes for Best Film category were also given. Over time the awards ceremony has expanded significantly; in 1954, a Best Director award was introduced with the second and third place prizes for Best Film being removed in 1955. In 1955, first Special Award for Best Child Artist was awarded. In 1956 a Best Cinematography award was created, and in 1962, Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards were also introduced. In 1990, the number of awards reached 10 with the addition of Best Screenplay, Best Music and Best Sound awards. The awards have topped out at 11 with the addition of a Best Editing award. In 2017, Myanmar Academy Awards introduced the Lifetime Achievement Award category. Adding to the unpredictability of the awards ceremony are prizes given to Special Awards some years and the duplication of awards when the judging panel cannot decide who should win. And of course, sometimes awards are simply not awarded if it is decided that no person is worthy. The first film to win the best picture award was Chit Thet Wai (Dear Thet Wai) in 1952. The best director award was first given to U Thu Kha for his Aww Main Ma (Oh, women!), a comic drama. Actor Kyaw Win won the first best actor award in Marlaryi with Kyi Kyi Htay winning best actress for her performance in Chit Thet Wai (Dear Thet Wai). As of 2017, there are total of 13 awards. # Best Picture # Best Director # Best Screenplay # Best Actor # Best Actress # Best Supporting Actor # Best Supporting Actress # Best Music # Best Cinematography # Best Film Editing # Best Sound # Special Award # Lifetime Achievement Award List of Myanmar Motion Picture Academy Awards ;1999 *Best Film -

The number of eligible film entries each year has declined dramatically since the 1980s. Due to heightened competition from foreign films and other entertainment media as well as escalating costs of production, the number of feature-length Burmese films has gone from nearly 100 films per year in the 1970s to barely more than ten today. The number of films screened were 95 in 1978, 75 in 1983, 65 in 1985. In 2008, only 12 were screened. As the Burmese film industry struggles to produce films each year, films that do get produced are mostly with established directors, actors and actresses. Most Burmese films today are dominated by comedies. The result is that the same coterie of players win the award year after year from a much shallower pool. It used to be that only few actors and actresses could claim as \\"academy award winner\\" or even fewer still as \\"repeat academy award winner\\". Venerable actors of old like Win Oo and Kawleikgyin Ne Win won just two each in their lifetime. Director Thukha and actress Myint Myint Khin who won six and five respectively were the exceptions, not the rule.

Club career Born in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Lemos joined Deportivo de La Coruña's youth setup in 2005 at the age of 12, after starting out at SD Villestro. He made his senior debuts with the former's reserves in 2011, in Tercera División. In July 2013, after making the pre-season with the first team, Lemos suffered a serious knee injury, only returning to the fields in March of the following year.

On 17 July 2015, he signed with CD Lugo from Segunda División after agreeing to a three-year deal. On 9 September 2015, Lemos played his first professional match, coming on as a second-half substitute for David Ferreiro in a 1–0 away win against Córdoba CF for the season's Copa del Rey. On 27 January of the following year he was handed a professional contract, being assigned the 14 jersey. On 5 July 2016, Lemos moved to La Liga side Celta de Vigo for five years. He first appeared in the competition the following 28 January, starting and scoring the first goal in a 2–0 success at CD Leganés, where he had already made his professional debut with his previous team. On 10 January 2018, after a six-month loan spell at RC Lens, Lemos returned to Lugo also in a temporary deal. On 19 June, he signed a three-year contract with UD Las Palmas.

LaMendola plays singing saw. Their music is often experimental and off-kilter in nature, shifting from humorous to dark, serious, or thoughtful in tone, sometimes within the same song. Time Out New York wrote \\"Ching Chong Song is a genuine New York oddity, drawing equally from junior-high musicals and graphic performance art. LaMendola commands the stage with her nerves unhinged, one part rising diva, the other local loon.\\" LaMendola's approach to saw playing is to use it primarily as a melodic instrument, rather than a simple atmospheric effect, which is demonstrated in such songs as \\"Lynette\\" and \\"Jonquil\\". The prevalence of saw in their music was noted by the Village Voice when they wrote \\"Cabaret weirdos Ching Chong song has have a surprisingly large amount of singing saw in their tunes.\\" The group have released two full-length studio albums, Little Naked Gay Adventure and Everything is for the Babies, both produced by Kevin Blechdom. The latter album also features Susan Hwang, of The Debutante Hour, as a third member, playing accordion, janggu (a traditional Korean drum) and providing a third vocal harmony. While Hwang also appears with them in promo photos, and performs with them as schedules permit, they do still perform as a duo. Their extended musical family also includes Johnny Dydo, Jeff Larson, Sam Grossman, Simon Beins, and Stefko. They have toured in the US and Europe, and performed at such diverse events as Art Basel, in Basel, Switzerland, Primavera a la Ciutat, in Barcelona, Spain, Ladyfest Rotterdam, in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and the Nachtbar Porn Festival in Berlin, Germany. They have also appeared on the NYC public access program Checkerboard Kids and were chosen to close the 22nd annual Antifolk Festival, hosted by Sidewalk Cafe owner and Anti-folk luminary, Lach. They were one of the groups listed as \\"Best Live Band in Town\\" in the New York Press 2009 Music Poll. Time Out New York also described them as \\"An unconventional duo that plays regularly at Sidewalk Café, Ching Chong Song stars Julie LaMendola (who sings and plays the saw) and Dan Gower (who plays the piano and wears a piano tie). Their songs are spare, but the pair compensate with enough chutzpah to fill Carnegie Hall.\\" Controversy The group have been criticised for their name, which some feel is derogatory and insensitive to Asians, as \\"ching chong\\" is generally considered to be a racial slur. As such, the group has been the object of a student group protest on a few occasions (such as New York University) and had one other show cancelled by Bryn Mawr College where they were scheduled to play. In a letter to the editor of Bryn Mawr's and Haverford's The Bi-College News Online regarding these incidents, LaMendola wrote of her disapproval of the cancellation of her group's show due to the band's name. This letter led to a spate of responses in the same Bryn Mawr publication. These events occurred in 2007, and the group has performed without incident since that time. Though briefly going by the name Church of Lurch, they have since continued to perform as Ching Chong Song. In 2010, Ching Chong Song topped a Village Voice readers poll for \\"Worst Band Name in New York\\", beating out groups Wakey!Wakey!, Freelance Whales, and Food Stamps for this dubious honor. The poll results were later lampooned by another NYC group, going by the moniker \\"Chink Floyd\\", citing their lack of inclusion in the poll.

She is a member of the Brahui people, an indigenous tribe of Balochistannow she has been settled in United States After Her marriage.  Biography  = Childhood = Khalida Brohi grew up in a small village in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan. Her parents had been married in a practice known as an exchange marriage, or watta satta. Her mother was 9 years old at the time, her father was 13. Brohi, the second oldest, was born two years later. She became the first girl in her village to go to school, and the first in her tribe to be educated. Brohi grew up in poverty, but her parents were keen to give their children opportunities they never had. When Brohi was very young, her parents moved them from the mud home which they enjoyed with extended family in Kotri to the city of Hyderabad in Sindh province in order to seek better opportunities. There they lived in a slum community, where her father worked a number of jobs, including as a part-time journalist, in order to earn the equivalent of just $6 per month. In Hyderabad, Brohi and her brother were sent to school with the little money that their father earned. The family grew and moved many more times, eventually landing in the slums of Karachi where Brohi continued her education. She had planned to study medicine and become the first doctor in her tribe, already an unusual path for girls, when an event changed everything. Her good friend and cousin was killed in the name of honor for falling in love with a boy who was not her betrothed. = Early Activism = Brohi was 16 when she decided to leave school and pursue justice for her cousin and all women and girls who become victims of honor killings. Her cousin had been murdered because she wanted to marry a person she loved instead of someone her family chose. Brohi began her activism by writing poetry about the experience and reading it at any event that would allow her to speak.  WAKE UP Campaign Against Honor Killings  Brohi was soon discovered by organizations fighting for women's rights and was invited to participate in conferences and workshops focused on ending honor killings and domestic violence. In 2008, she joined WAKE UP, an international organization committed to ending domestic violence. Using Facebook, Brohi organized WAKE UP rallies to pressure the national government of Pakistan to close the loopholes in the law that allow honor killings and domestic abuse. Her Facebook campaign garnered thousands of international followers and led to numerous demonstrations. It generally succeeded in raising awareness about the issue of honor killings both at home and abroad. In 2006 the Society Act broadened protections for women.  Youth and Gender Development Program  Despite the success of the WAKE UP campaign, Brohi realized that the awareness she was creating in Karachi and globally was not reaching the women and communities who were suffering from domestic violence and the custom of honor killings. In response, Brohi launched the Youth and Gender Development Program (YGDP). This initiative began as a weekly gathering of young women to discuss economic opportunities in their communities. However, with the backing of the UNHRC, it quickly expanded into skills-training programs for both women and men that taught computer and cottage industry manufacturing skills, while simultaneously educating participants about women's rights under the law and in Islam. The success of the program inspired Brohi to expand the idea and create an organization with a broader reach, leading to the founding of Sughar in 2009.  Sughar  Brohi recalls that in response, her father told her, \\"don't cry, strategize.\\" Instead of openly protesting, she created the Sughar Empowerment Society, which is a non-profit organization which helps women in Pakistan learn skills related to \\"economic and personal growth.\\" Sughar means \\"skilled, confident woman\\" in Urdu. The Sughar Empowerment Society provides women in the villages of Pakistan with income from their work, and the ability to \\"challenge negative cultural beliefs with education and information about women's rights.\\" The group allows Brohi to change cultural perceptions from within, instead of openly protesting. By 2013, there were 23 centers, serving 800 women who learn about \\"gender equality, preventing domestic violence, girls' education and women's rights,\\" all while they are creating work to be sold. The type of work the women create is traditional embroidery which is then sold to the fashion industry. Brohi would like to include a million women in Sughar within the next ten years, she said in 2013. While Brohi has been praised for her activism both inside and outside of Pakistan, she has also been threatened with violence for her work, including being shot at and bombed. = Social Entrepreneurship = One of the Sughar's initiatives was to create a tribal fashion brand which it called, Nomads, and featured products made by the Sughar women. Nomads debuted with an internationally acclaimed fashion show in 2012. In 2015, Brohi married David Barron, an American convert to Islam, in a rare love marriage because of their different cultural and social backgrounds. Together the couple founded The Chai Spot in Sedona, Arizona, a peace-building social enterprise focused on promoting Pakistani arts and hospitality, while at the same time providing uplifting opportunities for women and youth in Pakistan. In 2018, Khalida and David opened their second Chai Spot in Manhattan.

It did not go into production. Design The Villiers V made its first public appearance at the 1926 Paris Aero show, possibly before its first flight. As the military designation CN2 indicated, it was a two-seat chasseure de nuit or night fighter, designed and built to an Aviation Militaire specification. It was a sesquiplane with an upper to lower wing span ratio of about 1.4 and an area ratio of about 2.2 as the chord of the lower wing was also smaller. Apart from a centre section cut-out in the upper wing to enhance visibility from the cockpits and small root extensions on the lower wing, the two wings were strictly rectangular in plan and were wood framed and fabric covered. The Villiers V was a single bay biplane braced on each side by a single, faired duralumin interplane strut which leant outward to support the upper overhang and forward because of significant stagger. Four cabane struts supported the upper centre section close to the fuselage. Ailerons were fitted only on the upper wing. The Villiers V's fuselage was a flat sided, plywood covered monocoque. Its engine was a water cooled W-12 Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb in a cowling which followed the outline of the three separate cylinder blocks. The pilot's open cockpit was ahead of the trailing edge, under the upper wing cut-out, with the gunner close behind. The pilot controlled a pair of fixed synchronised Vickers machine guns firing through the propeller disc and the gunner was provided with a pair of Lewis guns on a flexible mount. The tail unit was conventional, with a broad chord, clipped triangular tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and fitted with separate, round edged, balanced elevators. The triangular fin and its full, rounded unbalanced rudder were also broad, the rudder extending down to the keel and operated in a gap between the elevators. The night fighter had fixed conventional tailskid landing gear with mainwheels on a single axle sprung to a pair of V-struts from the lower fuselage, assisted by a long tailskid. The night fighter was tested by the military under the designation Vil 5CN2 but was found not to provide enough improvement over existing equipment to justify production.

Due to Maggie's struggle, Joanna was later granted custody of Janice and the two later depart Salem. In September 1987, Janice returned to town when Maggie was recovering through a recurrent of Myasthenia Gravis. Janice stayed in town and took a job at Salem University Hospital where she had romances with both Bill Horton (Christopher Stone) and Mike Horton (Michael T. Weiss). Her romance with Bill tore the Horton family apart and made plans to leave Salem in March 1988 when she was murdered by the Riverfront Knifer, making her his second murder victim.

Kate Winograd Dr Kate Winograd, played by Elaine Princi, first appears in July 1977, when she is Head of Anesthesiology at Salem University Hospital.

Kate departs Salem in February 1978, and returns in 1979, when she has a sexual affair with Dr Neil Curtis. Kate and Bill's friendship begins when Bill, an accomplished surgeon, retrains in Anesthesiology after losing the ability to do surgery, thanks to a gunshot injury to his arm which causes nerve damage and impairs the use of his right hand. Bill retrains as an anesthesiologist so he can carry on working in the Operating room, and Kate supervises his re-training. Bill clashes with new Chief of Surgery, Dr Walter Griffin, because Bill thinks Griffin does unnecessary surgeries on patients and is \\"knife-happy\\". Bill is assigned to the night shift by the Chief of Staff Greg Peters, to avoid clashes with Griffin. This puts strain on Bill's marriage with Dr Laura Horton. Kate speaks up for Bill, saying the other trainees value him, and persuades Peters to put Bill back on the day shift. Bill's brother's neighbour Fred Barton falls downstairs and hits his head, and Bill rushes him into hospital. Fred haemorrhages and needs emergency brain-surgery, but the only surgeon available is an inexperienced junior trainee. The trainee panics in the Operating Room, and walks out. Bill has to do the surgery himself and he saves the man's life, with Kate assisting. But after the operation Barton is paralyzed from the waist down, and he sues the hospital and Bill and Kate. The trainee surgeon covers himself by saying Bill threw him out of the Operating Room; and Kate and Bill are fired from the hospital. Both unemployed, and both fighting the suit against them, Bill and Kate spend time with each other, and become close. They go for walks, and Bill kisses Kate at Christmas. At the same time, Laura's own work commitments have also put a strain on their marriage. Unhappy with his relationship with Kate, Laura throws Bill out, and he goes to live at the Salem Inn. Although Kate is in love with him, she also won't let Bill stay with her. She won't be the \\"other woman\\". Bill's brother Mickey persuades the young trainee surgeon to come clean about what he did; and Dr Marlena Evans helps Fred Barton realize that his paralysis is actually psychological, stemming from childhood traumas. On the day of Bill and Kate's trial, Barton walks into court! The case is thrown out, and Bill and Kate are re-instated at the hospital. That evening Bill and Kate celebrate and share a passionate kiss. But Kate breaks it off, and forces Bill to leave. Bill has a change of heart, and realizes his love for his wife Laura. He apologizes to Kate, telling her he mistook feelings of loyalty to her as love, and that he wants to remain friends and colleagues. Kate tells him she is leaving to take a job in Cleveland, but she really is heartbroken to miss her chance with the man she loves! In January 1979, with his hand better, Bill is offered the post of Chief of Surgery, and he accepts. Kate is over her infatuation with Bill, and with Laura's blessing, he re-hires Kate as Head of Anesthesiology. Kate assures Bill and Laura that she and Bill are now just good friends. Kate and Bill work away together when they go help flood-victims out of town. Laura's mentally-ill mother commits suicide, and Laura is traumatized. She begins to have hallucinations of her dead mother, who tells her to do things. Laura becomes paranoid, and she accuses Kate of moving in on Bill, telling her everyone at the hospital is talking about it. Kate tries to reassure Laura that she is just friends with Bill, to no avail. As Kate's reputation is very important to her, she resigns from the hospital again. Bill asks Kate to stay near by, but she gives him the cold shoulder. In truth, Kate is having an affair with Dr Neil Curtis, and her affair with Neil has just become sexual. Kate is resolved to leave town, as she does not want to cause the breakdown of marriages. : See also: Kate Roberts See also * Days of Our Lives characters * Days of Our Lives characters (1960s) * Days of Our Lives characters (1980s) * Days of Our Lives characters (1990s) * Days of Our Lives characters (2000s) * Days of Our Lives characters (2010s) * Days of Our Lives cast members * List of previous Days of Our Lives cast members Notes and references 1970s ","title":"List of Days of Our Lives characters (1970s)"},{"id":"47770440","text":"The Egypt electoral list is an electoral alliance in Egypt that was established between the Egyptian Front and the Independent Current Coalition to contest the 2015 Egyptian parliamentary election.

A few days later, the smear campaign against me was in full swing. She became an assistant to Mike Quill of the Transport Workers Union, founded in 1934 by Quill for subway workers in New York City and which had leadership dominated by the CPUSA during its early years up through 1948 during the presidential campaign of Henry A. Wallace. She worked for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, founded in 1936 by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), disbanded in 1942 to become the United Steel Workers of America, now the United Steelworkers (USW) union. She also served as secretary of Emergency Civil Liberties Union, founded in 1951 under the direction of Clark Foreman, formed as a breakaway from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), known after 1968 as the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee (NECLC), and merged in 1998 with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR). She was still secretary (as \\"Elinor Ferry Kirstein\\") in 1958. In the 1950s, her name appears in print in various political capacities. In 1957, her name appears in a \\"Trotskyite\\" debate in the International Socialist Review. In 2001, her name receives mention as an Independent-Socialist Party \\"campaigner.\\" Hiss case During the 1950s, Ferry documented McCarthyism and First Amendment defendants. Defendants whom she contacted include Anne Braden. She spent many years writing about the Alger Hiss. Her correspondence appears in the Hiss papers at Harvard. According to Allen Weinstein, Ferry was a \\"friend and defense researcher\\" of Hiss who \\"worked closely with Helen Buttenweiser on research for Hiss's retrial motion.\\" He also noted that \\"Links between The Nation and the Hiss defense had been close from the beginning of the case,\\" starting with publisher Frida Kirchwey and followed by succeeding publisher George Kirstein (Ferry's husband). According to G. Edgar White, she was \\"Helen Buttenweiser's research assistant.\\" Her work was to result in a negative \\"political history\\" of Whittaker Chambers and a defense for Hiss. In The Nation, she once called her unpublished book Whittaker Chambers: Agent Provocateur. As early as 1952, other writers began to draw on her research to discredit Chambers. Author John Chabot Smith cited Ferry's interview with Max Bedacht (whom Chambers claimed had delivered his summons to the Soviet underground) and wrote that \\"Bedacht denied the whole story; he told journalist Elinor Ferry it was a flat lie, and that he had never had any connections with an underground of any sort, Russian or American\\". In his \\"psychobiography\\" on Chambers, author Meyer Zeligs cites copious usage of materials from Ferry. Author Julia M. Allen cited Ferry about Chambers' wife, \\"Recollections of Esther Shemitz reflect the gender rigidity of the time and help to explain why both Hutchins and Rocher felt especially protective of her. In interviews conducted by Elinor Ferry in the 1950s, Shemitz was characterized as being 'masculine'.\\" FBI The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated Ferry from 1952 through 1968. Personal Ferry married at least twice, the second time to George Kirstein for ten years. (Kirstein bought The Nation magazine in 1955 and ran it until 1965). She had at least one child, James. She resided mostly in Mamaroneck, New York, and died in 1993. Friends since the mid-1950s included Nora Ruth Roberts (\\"a good friend of mine and valued comrade since 1957\\" she wrote in 2013 ) and Matthew Mills Stevenson.

The school is situated next to the Songhua River. The school was center of left-wing political thought during the 1920s. Among prominent alumni is Kim Il-sung, the first leader of North Korea. There is a museum, a schoolroom memorial and a statue dedicated to him at the school. There is also a slogan proclaiming Sino-Korean friendship on the roof. History The school was founded in 1917. The school was heavily influenced by left-wing ideology in the late 1920s, and was described as the most progressive in the city. Many prominent Chinese left-wing intellectuals have taught in the school, including Guo Moruo and Shang Yue. In 1964 Deng Xiaoping allowed the school to continue use the name \\"Yuwen\\". In 1978 Jilin Province officials approved Yuwen as the focus of the first run high school, and in 2003 the local government identified the school as a model high school. Since 2005 there has been an international cooperation program with Australia. There have also been recent cultural exchanges with schools from countries such as United States and Japan. =Kim Il-sung= Kim Il-sung during his time in Yuwen Middle School North Korean president Kim Il-sung attended the school for two and a half years starting from 1927. The school was described as the most progressive in the city of Jilin. Kim organized protests against \\"reactionary teachers\\" and Japanese-made goods in 1928. Kim was part of the South Manchurian Communist Youth Association there in 1929. Kim was arrested in the spring of 1929 and was consequentially expelled from the school. Kim Il-sung struggled to continue his studies in Yuwen High School. He had to live in a cheap dormitory owned by the Methodist Church, as recalled by his younger friend from the school. Kim survived from his mother's modest earnings after his father died. Kim wrote in his memoirs that he tried to spare his only pair of shoes for school by walking barefoot. Kim also complained about the blatant nature of the class society of Jilin. There is a bronze statue of Kim Il-sung, portraying him in a guerrilla uniform, at the school grounds. A schoolroom where Kim Il-sung studied is retained as a memorial, and there is a modest museum at the school. Kim also studied in the Korean Huadian School (also known as Hwasong Middle School), which was also in Manchuria. When he chose to enroll in the Chinese- language Yuwen Middle School, he would have had other choices beyond Korean Huadian School, because there were other Korean language schools in Manchuria. Visits by North Korean officials Since 1964 the Pyongyang Akinori school has been a sister school, and related visits have been received since then. A slogan on the roof of the building proclaims: \\"Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship\\". In September 2010, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il made Yuwen Middle School his first stop during a trip to China. Kim stayed there for some 20 minutes. Only days later, upon his return, Kim pronounced his son Kim Jong- un as his successor. The visit to Yuwen associated with Kim Il-sung's youth thus became a political message of a young successor's viability. Premier Choe Yong-rim visited the school, too, in November 2010. On 15 April 2014 around 400 to 500 North Koreans gathered at the school in honor of Kim Il-sung's birthday. Volleyball and other sporting events were held on the same day in Jilin. No Chinese officials attended, but Chinese security was present. On 6 July 2014 officials from the DPRK's Shenyang consulate-general joined Chinese officials and Chinese-Koreans in a ceremony to lay floral baskets at Kim Il- sung's statue.

The design of the unfinished creative work, which featured a deer with a child's face, was met with a mixed reception. Unable to meet TriMet's standards and remain under budget, in November 2011 Alavi withdrew his design from the project. Description Seyed Alavi's Rebirth was a proposed sculpture considered for installation at the MAX Orange Line's Southeast Park Avenue MAX Station in Oak Grove, an unincorporated area neighboring Milwaukie. The design of the unfinished creative work called for a yellow-painted deer with a child's face and was intended to represent \\"the interaction between the nearby riparian forest and the people living in Oak Grove\\". In its concept proposal, the art installation is described as: Alavi's second, more \\"humanized\\", rendering of the sculpture Two renderings of Alavi's design were made available to the public; the first computer-generated image did not include context, which arguably provoked debate over its design, while the second was more \\"humanized\\" and illustrated how the installation could interact with people and the surrounding environment. TriMet confirmed at least two changes to the sculpture's original design: a move to the southeast to avoid crossing into the Trolley Trail or Milwaukie's boundaries, and removal of its mosaic tile facade to reduce costs. In October 2011, the artist presented a revised concept to TriMet's Public Art Advisory Committee. The sculpture's color and dimensions were unchanged, but it would be made of glass-reinforced concrete. Its surface treatment remained undetermined, but Alavi wanted one that would be \\"natural or inherent\\" to the material to achieve a \\"reflective, glowing, and magical\\" appearance. The committee preferred the reflective appearance seen in the artist's original design and requested material samples at his final presentation, which was scheduled to take place in December. History and public reaction Upon public release, Rebirth design became a \\"target for ridicule\\". In June 2011, Milwaukie neighborhood association leaders sent a letter to the Public Art Advisory Committee expressing their disappointment with the proposed deer concept, hoping to see changes to its final design. Some residents thought the sculpture should be more accessible and less expensive; conversely, the Oak Lodge Community Council chairwoman, who also served as a member of the art committee, hoped the sculpture could serve as a community space and reach \\"icon\\" status. In a formal letter, TriMet's general manager responded to the neighborhood associations by encouraging residents to \\"communicate directly with the art committee by inviting members to neighborhood association leadership meetings\\". The agency's spokeswoman also told committee leaders that the public was welcome to share their preferences regarding the work's dimensions, fabrication methods, form, and materials. Oak Grove and Milwaukie residents also disagreed about whether or not those in the latter city had a say about the sculpture, which would have been within the area's boundaries according to the first design. In October 2011, at a public meeting to address TriMet's projected budget gap, one Milwaukie resident asked the agency to abandon its plans to fund Rebirth, saying that \\"a lot of people think that thing's just ugly. Why are they spending money on something that's an unnecessary add-on at the same time they're talking about cutting bus routes again?\\" The agency's general manager responded that all possibilities would be considered, though TriMet officials confirmed that cuts to its public art program were not an option and the MAX Orange Line's budget was separate from TriMet's financial problems. In November 2011, TriMet's public art coordinator confirmed Alavi's withdrawal from the project, saying, \\"The artist for Park (Avenue) did his due diligence. He did everything possible to make that a reality, but sometimes it's not realistic.\\" According to The Oregonian, Alavi was unable to meet the Public Art Advisory Committee's technical requirements and remain under budget. One committee member admitted, \\"The form itself was something a lot of people out in the community weren't happy with in the first place, so once the mosaic piece was taken away, it kind of devalued it.\\" Alavi released the following statement: The debate over the sculpture's proposed design by TriMet, the art committee, and members of the public reached \\"near- yelling match\\" status, resulting in \\"animosity and general nastiness\\". Following Alavi's withdrawal, the art committee made plans to reconvene and consider other design proposals for the site. Critical response In articles providing updates about the sculpture's status, The Oregonian called the work \\"larger-than-life style highway art\\" and \\"Twilight Zone Bambi\\". Angela Webber of the Daily Journal of Commerce expressed her love for the sculpture and disappointment in the public's reaction. She wrote, \\"This makes me so sad. [...] Apparently, this giant baby-faced deer statue isn't pretty enough for Milwaukie. [...] I imagine the folks of Milwaukie just don't get it.\\" Following confirmation about the artist's withdrawal, the journal's Aaron Spencer said local residents are being deprived of the sculpture's \\"disturbing fantastical whimsy\\". In an article called \\"Let's save the giant baby-faced deer statue!\\", he wrote: \\"As we all know, I love this statue. I love it a lot. And I think we can save it. There are lots of places in Portland that could use some beautification, and a little public art can go a long way.\\" Spencer and a colleague compiled a gallery of images created using Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the sculpture's potential.

Built by Cammell Laird, Douglas commissioned in December 1918, just after the end of the First World War. During the Second World War, Campbell mainly served with as a convoy escort, particularly on the East Coast of the United Kingdom. She survived the war, and was sold for scrap in 1947. Design and construction HMS Campbell was one of five Admiralty type flotilla leaders ordered from Cammell Laird (3) and Hawthorn Leslie (2) in April 1917.. The ship was long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Design displacement was normal and full load. The ship's machinery consisted of four Yarrow boilers that fed steam at to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared-steam turbines, rated at . This gave a design speed of light, which corresponded to about at full load. Up to 504 tons of oil fuel could be carried, giving a range of at . Campbells main gun armament consisted of five 4.7 in (120 mm)/45 calibre BL Mark I guns, on CP VI mountings capable of elevating to 30 degrees. These guns could fire a shell to at a rate of 5–6 rounds per minute per gun. 120 rounds per gun were carried. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single 3 inch (76 mm) 20 cwt gun and two 2-pounder (40 mm) \\"pom-pom\\" autocannon. Torpedo armament consisted of six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in two triple mounts. She had a complement of 183 officers and ratings. Campbell was laid down on 10 November 1917, launched on 21 September 1918 and commissioned on 21 December 1918. =Pennant Number = Campbell carried the Pendant number G.76 from January 1919. =Modifications= While the Admiralty type flotilla leaders had only limited modifications between the wars,Whitley 2000, p. 86. an early change during the Second World War was the replacement of the amidships 4.7-inch gun by two 2-pounder pom-poms, with the aft funnel shortened to improve the field of fire for the 3 inch anti-aircraft gun.Friedman 2009, p. 242. In 1941, \\"X\\"-gun (the superimposed gun aft) was removed and replaced by the 3-inch anti-aircraft gun which was relocated from its original amidships position. Both sets of torpedo tubes were retained. Two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were mounted on the bridge wings, while further Oerlikon guns later replaced the 2-pounders. Radar (Type 286, later replaced by Type 290 and Type 271) was also fitted during the war. Service =Between the wars= On entering service, Campbell joined the 15th Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet as leader, and when the Grand Fleet was disbanded in April 1919, and the Atlantic Fleet established in its place, Campbell moved to the newly established 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, based first at Rosyth and later at Port Edgar, still as leader. In July that year, Campbell led part of the Third Flotilla when it was deployed to the Baltic Sea as part of the British campaign to support the newly established Baltic states against Bolshevik Russia during the Russian Civil War. In 1921, the destroyer flotillas were reorganised, reducing in size from 16 destroyers with two leaders to eight destroyers with a single leader. Campbell remained with the revised, smaller, Third Flotilla. Campbell remained as leader of the Third Flotilla until 1923, when she transferred to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla. She was hit by a practice torpedo on 8 October 1924, with the resulting damage requiring 20 days docked at Rosyth to repair. Campbell remained as leader of the 6th Flotilla until February 1930 when she entered refit at Portsmouth, during which her boilers were retubed. On completion of the refit in June 1931, Campbell returned to the 6th Flotilla, serving with that Flotilla until May 1935. Campbell, with a reserve crew, took part in the Fleet Review marking the Silver Jubilee of King George V. In September 1935, Campbell joined the newly established 21st Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, formed from the Reserve Fleet to replace ships sent to the Mediterranean as a result of the Abyssinia Crisis, and served as leader until the Flotilla was disbanded in December 1936. On 21 March 1937, with the Spanish Civil War ongoing, Campbell and the destroyer evacuated 450 child refugees from Bilbao to Île d'Oléron, France. By August 1938, Campbell was back in reserve on the Nore, awaiting a refit, which did not start until April 1939. =Second World War= Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Campbell underwent a refit which continued until February 1940, when she took part in convoy escort operations in the North Sea and the Western Approaches. In April 1940, Campbell was diverted to Scapa Flow as a result of the German invasion of Norway, landing troops at Molde on 23 April. Campbell took part in evacuation operations from Harstad and Andfjorden between 3 and 12 June 1940, before returning to convoy escort duties, supplementing them by anti-invasion patrols. On 20 June 1940, the German submarine torpedoed and sank the cargo ship . Campbell rescued the 38 survivors from Empire Conveyor, landing then at Liverpool on 21 June. On the night of 19/20 November, Campbell and the were on patrol east of Lowestoft when they encountered three Schnellboot (S-boats or German motor torpedo boats), S38, S54 and S57. S38 was sunk by ramming. On the night of 19/20 November 1941, Campbell, along with Garth and the destroyer formed a support group for Convoy FS650, consisting of 59 merchant ships, which also had a close escort of two destroyers and two corvettes, when the convoy was attacked by four S-boats off Great Yarmouth. Three merchant ships, , and were sunk, with one S-boat sunk. When responding the attack, Campbell mistook Garth for a German ship and fired on her, hitting Garth with six pom- pom shells. These shells seriously damaged Garth, causing loss of all steam and electrical power and immobilising the ship (which had to be towed back to port), and killed two men. Campbell was one of six destroyers that were ordered to reinforce Dover Command on 3 February 1942, in anticipation that the German battleships and and heavy cruiser would attempt to return from Brest in German occupied France to Germany. On the night of 11/12 February, the German ships left Brest to pass through the British blockade, in what became known as the Channel Dash, but were undetected by the British owing to a combination of German jamming and British technical failures. The six destroyers (Campbell, , , , and , under the command of Captain Captain C. T. M. Pizey aboard Campbell) were exercising off Harwich when the Germans were finally detected, and were ordered to intercept the German fleet off the mouth of the River Scheldt, steering a course through a German minefield to allow the interception to take place. One destroyer, Walpole was forced to turn back due to mechanical trouble, but the remaining five destroyers reached the German force at 15:42 hr. They launched torpedoes at a range of , but none hit, while Worcester was heavily damaged by German shells. On 12 March 1942, Campbell collided with the destroyer , and was under repair at the Southampton shipyard of Thornycroft until 25 April that year. From 2 to 7 September 1942, Campbell formed part of the escort of the Arctic convoy PQ 18 on its initial leg from Loch Ewe to Iceland. Campbell continued on East coast escort duty through the rest of 1942 and into 1943. She was refitted at London from February to April 1943. On the night of 24/25 October 1943, Campbell was part of the escort (consisting of 5 destroyers, 6 Motor Gun Boats and two Motor Launches) of Convoy FN1160 when it came under attack by 32 S-boats. The escort managed to drive off the attacks with only the trawler William Stephen being sunk, while the S-boat S63 was sunk by the destroyer Mackay and S88 was sunk by Motor Gun Boats. In June 1944, Campbell took part in Operation Neptune, the naval operations supporting the Allied Invasion of Normandy. On 4 June, the landings, planned for 5 June, were postponed for a day due to poor weather forecasts. Campbell was at sea when the postponement signal was sent out, and observed a group of minesweepers (the 14th Minesweeper Flotilla) in the process of sweeping mines. In the belief that the minesweepers had not received the postponement signal (in fact it had been received, but the commander of the minesweepers had decided to continue clearing the mines from the swept channel before returning to port) Campbell and the sloop closed with the minesweepers to signal them by semaphore (strict radio silence had been imposed). Campbell soon found herself in the middle of a field of floating mines and had to be extricated by the minesweepers.Edwards 2013, Part 2: Execution:Chapter 1: Twenty-Four Hours Postponement. Campbell continued convoy escort operations in the Channel in support of the landings until July, when she returned to East coast convoy operations. Campbell continued on escort operations along the east coast and English Channel until the end of the war in Europe. On 13 May 1945, Campbell formed part of the escort for the cruiser and the fast minelayers and as they carried the Norwegian Government-in-Exile and Crown Prince Olav home from exile to Oslo. =Disposal= Campbell went into reserve after the end of the Second World War, and was transferred on 18 February 1947 to BISCO for scrapping and was broken up by Metal Industries of Rosyth from 30 March 1948.

Gökböri commanded the right wing of the Zengid army, which broke Saladin's left flank before being routed by a charge from Saladin's personal guard. Despite around men being involved on both sides, Saladin gained a nearly bloodless victory owing to the psychological effect of the arrival of his Egyptian reinforcements. Following the battle, Saladin initially placed the rightful Zengid heirs over these territories: Muhammad ibn Shirkuh in Homs, Palmyra, and al-Rahba; Shihab al-Din al-Harimi over Hama; and Ibn al-Muqaddam in Baalbek. Gökböri himself defected in 1182. Once his power was further consolidated, however, they were deposed in favor of members of his own dynasty. On 6 May 1175, Saladin's opponents agreed to a treaty recognizing his rule over Syria, apart from Aleppo. Saladin requested that the Abbasid caliph acknowledge his right to the entirety of Nur ad-Din's empire, but he was simply recognized as lord over what he already held and encouraged to attack the Crusaders in Jerusalem.

Saudi Arabia does not consider Syrians as refugees. They are provided access to education and healthcare, and allowed to take up jobs like other expats Refugees , the flow of refugees to the European Union has increased significantly, and there is a rise in criticism of some Muslim nations for allegedly accepting few refugees. The Syrian Civil War forced millions to flee their homes in search of safety. Saudi Arabia, as a rich country, was heavily criticized for not offering land to Syrian refugees – it only offers resettlement for asylum-seekers whose families already reside in Saudi Arabia. =Total number= The CIA World Factbook estimated that , foreign nationals living in Saudi Arabia made up about 21% of the population. Total number of Syrians in Saudi Arabia was 100,000 before the start of Syrian Civil War. Saudi Arabia, like all the other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, which mandates member states to protect refugees within their country. However, according to a Saudi official, Saudi Arabia has issued residency permits to 100,000 Syrians. On the other hand, the BBC claims, \\"Most successful cases are Syrians already in the Gulf states extending their stays, or those entering because they have family there,\\" and, \\"No Syrians claiming asylum have been taken in by Saudi Arabia or other wealthy Gulf countries.\\" Syrians in Saudi Arabia include migrants from Syria to Saudi Arabia and their descendants.

However, the BBC reports that Saudi Arabia has let in 500,000 Syrian refugees since 2011, while Arab News reported that Saudi Arabia was already home to 500,000 Syrians Saudi Arabia claims to have granted 100,000 Syrians residency. An official from Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Saudi Arabia \\"made it a point not to deal with them as 'refugees'.\\" Huffington post has criticized the international community for saying that Saudi Arabia has taken no refugees.

For many years it influenced political attitudes in Great Britain and France towards the Russian Empire. John Barrow, The Life of Peter the Great, Chapter \\"Note on the Alleged Will of Peter the Great\\"Dimitry V. Lehovich, \\"The Testament of Peter the Great\\", American Slavic and East European Review Vol. 7, No. 2 (Apr., 1948), pp. 111-124 Forged at the break of 19th century, it resurfaced during the Crimean War, during the Russo- Turkish War of 1877-1878, during the World War I and in the immediate post- World War II times. History In 1812 wrote, under Napoleon's command, a memoir Des Progrès de la puissance russe depuis son origine jusqu'au commencement du XIXe siècle (\\"Progress of the Russian Power, from Its Origin to the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century\\"), in which a summary of the alleged Will was inserted. The memoir intended to justify Napoleon's war plans against Russia. Walter K. Kelly in his History of Russia (1854) quotes The Will from Frederic Gaillardet's Mémoires du Chevalier d'Éon (1836). Gaillardet claimed that this document was stolen from Russia by d'Éon. While questioning its authenticity, Kelly comments that the document fairly reflects the politics of Russia in the past 100 years. The same was noted by Russian historian Sergey Shubinsky, who commented that the first 11 points of The Will is a fair recapitulation of Russian foreign policy since Peter's death (1725) until 1812. In 1912 Polish historian Michel Sokolnicki (Michał Sokolnicki) found in archives of French Ministry of Foreign Affairs a 1797 memorandum \\"Aperçu sur la Russie of his ancestor, general Michał Sokolnicki and wrote a journal article \\"Le Testament de Pierre le Grand: Origines d'un prétendu document historique\\".The American Historical Review, 1912, p.705 General Sokolnicki claimed that he glimpsed a plan of Peter I to subjugate Europe in Russian archives and memorized major points. These points bear a remarkable similarity to those presented by Lesur, so it is quite possible that Lesur borrowed from Sokolnicky. Historian Sokolnicki also maintains that his ancestor did not invent The Will himself, but rather wrote down a long- existing Polish tradition.

In addition to the Nippon Foundation and UBC, the program partners with University of Cambridge, Duke University, Princeton University, Stockholm University, United Nations Environment Program-World Conservation Monitoring Centre and Utrecht University. The program is built around three core objectives: to conduct collaborative ocean research across the natural and social sciences, to develop an interdisciplinary network of experts that can engage in discussion of complex and multifaceted questions of ocean sustainability, and to transfer these ideas to practical solutions in global policy forums. Program leadership * Yoshitaka Ota is director (policy) of the NF-UBC Nereus Program. He is a research assistant professor for the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington. His main research is anthropology of fishing, assessing current global outlook of indigenous fishing and coastal food security. He also works on ocean governance and policy, marine spatial planning and knowledge communication. * William Cheung is director (science) of the NF-UBC Nereus Program and the principal investigator of the UBC Nereus Research group since 2014. He is also an associate professor at the University of British Columbia. His main research area is on assessing impacts of fishing and climate change on marine ecosystems and their goods and services, and studying ways to reconcile trade- offs in their management. * Daniel Pauly is the chair of the Nereus steering committee and a member of the advisory board. He is professor at the University of British Columbia and the principal investigator of the Sea Around Us Program. His research focuses on the global impact of fishing on the world’s oceans and has developed the concept of shifting baseline and fishing down marine food webs. Budget US$15 million (1.5 million annually for 9 years from 2011 to 2019). The Nereus Program is solely funded by the Nippon Foundation, the largest non-governmental foundation in Asia. Public engagement and policy applications The Nereus Program is engaged with policy processes both at international and regional levels. The program has organized side events and workshops together with international organization representatives and national governmental officers. 2017: Side event at the UN Oceans Conference titled “The Role of the Oceans in Sustainability: Benefits of Achieving SDG 14 for all Sustainable Development Goals\\", where discussions led by Nereus affiliates were focused on how research indicates that achieving SDG 14 ocean targets contributes to the achievement of other SDG targets in the context of our changing ocean due to climate change and social equity. 2016: Side event at the United Nations Fish Stock Agreement Review Conference titled “Science, Policy and Civil Society: The Role of NGOs in Global Fisheries Management\\", where ongoing Nereus research on the potential role of civil society within regional fisheries management organizations was presented.http://www.nereusprogram.org/managing-straddling-and-highly- migratory-fish-stocks-nereus-holds-side-event-at-the-un-fish-stocks-agreement- review-conference/ 2015: Press conference on the Nereus Program report in Tokyo (covered by 20 international media outlets, including CBS, and five major Japanese newspapers). 2013: Side event at the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea on seafood security and climate change (attended by nine countries representatives including Japan, US and Palau) Fellowships The Nereus Program provides fellowships to young scholars who conduct their research at participating academic institutes. Since 2011, there have been 30 Nereus Fellows working in various issues on the future of oceans and fisheries. Currently, 11 postdoc and 7 Ph.D. students in the natural and social sciences are participating in the Nereus Program as Nereus Fellows. Program Alumni have gone on to marine research positions in various institutes, including at the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, University of South Carolina, International Atomic Energy Agency, and ETH Zurich. Reports In May 2017, the Nereus Program released a research report, 'Oceans and Sustainable Development Goals: Co-Benefits, Climate Change and Social Equity', bringing attention to the co-benefits of achieving the ocean goal SDG 14 on other sustainable development goals. Within the report, Nereus affiliate members have highlighted the idea that climate issues and social equity issues are inter-related; thus, this report has deduced that improving the health of our oceans through SDG 14 targets will contribute to the improvement of other areas of society, including, but not limited to, gender equality, sustained economic development, education quality, terrestrial conservation, reduced poverty, and food security. In June 2015, the Program released a research report entitled 'Predicting Future Oceans — Climate Change, Oceans & Fisheries', summarizing the main contributions of the numerous projects undertaken by the members of the Nereus Program and its associated colleagues in cross-disciplinary analyses of the global ocean systems. Specifically, this year’s report discussed global changes that are impacting the marine ecosystems’ seafood production capacity, emerging trends in ocean governance, and socioeconomic changes that are affecting our relationship with the sea.

The church is situated north of Aarhus city centre, west of Risskov and the Bay of Aarhus, on the morainal hills of the Egå valley, with a view of Kalø Vig and Helgenæs. It is a parish church belonging to the Church of Denmark. The parish has a population of 7,148 (2015).  History  Vejlby Church in medieval times belonged to the canon administration under Aarhus Cathedral. Following the reformation, the church was confiscated by the state and on 29 April 1720 it was given to a merchant from Aarhus. The merchant died in 1741 but the church stayed in the family until 1770 when it was sold to the Aarhus County administrator. It was transferred many times in the following years until Anders Rasmussen in Brendstrup and Christian Faurschou bought it in 1784. In 1810 the parish tithe was sold to the landowners within the parish. The church became an independent institution within the Church of Denmark in 1911. Vejlby Church originally did not have its own priest. The canon administration in Aarhus Cathedral appointed officials to serve as priests up to 1680 when the last canon died. The church was subsequently annexed to the chaplain in the cathedral where it stayed until the early 19th century. In 1803 it was decided that Vejlby parish should become a separate pastorate upon the next vacancy which occurred in 1811 and the parish has since had its own priest. The church cemetery is associated to a myth similar to the Bible story of Jephthah. Allegedly the builder of the cemetery promised to bury the first living being he met after construction had been completed; it happened to be his son.  Architecture  The nave and choir are in Romanesque style constructed of boulders with ashlar around the corners, windows and doors. In the late medieval period the church was renovated. A Gothic tower and porch, and vaults in the nave, were added. According to an inscription it was Bishop Niels Clausen (bishop 1490-1520) who in 1492 was responsible for the renovation. The church is decorated with frescos from the same period.

Perhaps best known for creating the popular series, El Muerto: The Aztec Zombie, the majority of his works are published through his privately owned imprint, Los Comex. Early life Javier Hernandez was born on born April 23, 1966, in Los Angeles, California, a year later moving with his family to Whittier, California which he now proudly calls his hometown. His early introduction to comic books came when his older brother, who had long grown out of comic book collecting, had left his books to Javier. He would later credit the comics of the 1960s and 1970s as his artistic inspirations. Lucha Libre had an early influence on him, as well as such television staples as Speed Racer, The Addams Family, Giant Robot and The Six Million Dollar Man. Career Hernandez conceived El Muerto sometime in the early 1990s, a character originally intended to be part of a group of Mexican-American superheroes. Later abandoning other members of the group, he began to focus on El Muerto's character development. El Muerto would later become a unique blend of Mexican and Chicano folklore, Aztec mythology and mysticism, and comic book pop culture. The character continued to appear in sketchbook to sketchbook until his public debut in a xeroxed black-and- white comic book entitled \\"Daze of the Dead: The Numero Uno Edition\\" (February 1998) which recounted the character's origin story. El Muerto was once Diego de la Muerte, a young man who while en route to a local Dia de los Muertos celebration is abducted and sacrificed by the Aztec gods of death and destiny, and later sent back to the land of the living a year after his death, with supernatural powers. Hernandez would later re-issue the story under the Big Umbrella imprint, formed by both himself and fellow comic creators Rafael Navarro, Michael Aushenker, Ted Seko, and Rhode Montijo who, along with Jim Lujan and Raul Aguirre Jr., would later go on to comprise the roster of \\"The Cartoonistas.\\" ElMuerto.com - The Official Site of El Muerto, the Aztec Zombie!International Hero - Big Umbrella Comics Big Umbrella later disbanded sometime in 2003, citing problems in the market-place, and El Muerto has since reverted to its Los Comex imprint. The initial series of El Muerto was met with critical success and the character's popularity has led to appearances and adaptations in other media, including a live-action film starring Wilmer Valderrama, for which Hernandez is credited as associate-producer.Comic Book Movies - El Muerto Hernandez surprised fans in 2008 with the creation of a political comic book character, Demolition Dove. The character made his public debut in a preview sketchbook at the 2008 San Gabriel Comic-Con, which included the short story, \\"A Tale of Two Parties\\".JAVZILLA - Demolition Dove debuts at SUPERMARKET!

Singers are in grades three through twelve,http://www.berksyouthchorus.org/join/auditions/ and come from Berks and neighboring counties. The group was founded in 1992 by Donald Hinkle, and has been led by Executive Director Dail Richie since 1997. The organization has received various accolades, including, in April 2001, top scores, all superior, during the three-day Heritage Children’s Choir Festival in New York City. History Berks Classical Children's Chorus was founded in 1992 by Donald Hinkle, and held its inaugural concert on November 8, 1992, at Governor Mifflin Senior High School in Shillington, Pennsylvania. On April 24, 1993, the chorus appeared in Carl Orff's Carmina Burana with Reading Choral Society. Starting with 60 members, the chorus membership later exceeded 100 students. In 1996, the chorus conducted its first tour, to Washington, D.C. Later that year, the MasterSingers, the high school group, was formally started. In 1997, Dail Richie was appointed Executive Director, taking over some administrative duties of founder Donald Hinkle, and initiating others. In 1999, Donald Hinkle was appointed Artistic Director, the first person to hold the position in the organization. In 2005, BCCC moved rehearsals and headquarters to the local arts and community center GoggleWorks. That same year, founder and Artistic Director Donald Hinkle retired from his duties in the chorus. Four years later, in 2009, the chorus began to offer its annual Summer Sing camps in downtown Reading. These camps are offered free to children in grades three through six. In 2012, in an effort to better represent the diversity of repertoire performed by the groups, the organization changed its name to Berks Youth Chorus (BYC). Current Groups * Training Chorus (Girls and Boys in Grades 3 – 4): The Training Chorus offers a beginning music education curriculum, which teaches the basic fundamentals of music in a choral setting. Training chorus is currently directed by Michelle Metz. * Chorale (Girls and Boys in Grades 5 – 8): Chorale is the mid- level treble choir. The curriculum strengthens skills learned in Training Chorus. This group appears in programs and concerts by invitation in addition to performing in the BYC concerts. Past performances include appearances with the Reading Symphony Orchestra and The Bach Choir of Bethlehem. Chorale is currently directed by Mark Helms. * MasterSingers (Girls in Grades 9 – 12; Boys with Changed Voices): The MasterSingers is an advanced SATB ensemble. Like the Chorale, this group appears in programs and concerts by invitation in addition to performing in the BYC concerts. Past performances include appearances with Allentown Symphony Orchestra, The Bach Choir of Bethlehem, Reading Choral Society, and Wheatland Chorale. MasterSingers is currently directed by Christopher Hoster.

The guild was established in 1336; their guild house, the Haus zur Haue building, is situated at the Limmatquai. Coats of arms of Zunft zum Kämbel guild house at Limmatquai  Guild house  The present Kämbel guild house, the Haus zur Haue building, is situated at the Limmatquai respectively Rathaus nearby the Constaffel, Saffran and Zimmerleuten guild houses. Zunft zum Kämbel was originally a guild of food dealers and wine merchants. Its first Trinkstube (tavern and association meeting place) was located near the medieval town hall at Münsterhof. Their guild house was first mentioned in a 1389 document as Kembel. In 1487 the guild acquired the House zum Kämbel which is still located at the Münsterhof 18. The siting at the Münsterhof plaza is seen as a deliberate distancing from the noble guild houses of the more prominent guilds in Zürich.  History  The origins of the Kämbel guild date back to 1336, when it, along with the other medieval Zürich guilds and the knight's association (Constaffel), was founded on occasion of the Brun guild constitution. The guilds were associations of various craft associations, at the same time they were economical, political, social and even military organizations that participated the wars of the medieval city republic in independent military formations. The guild masters constituted also the councillors of the elitary council of the medieval city republic of Zürich, until the French revolutionary troops terminated the guild regime, and the so-called Old Swiss Conferacy collapsed in spring 1798. In 1801 the Kämbel members sold their guildhall, but by the Act of Mediation in 1803 and 1815, the guild temporarily was re-established as one of the thirteen constituencies as municipal election guilds. In the 1838 election guilds were abolished at the cantonal level, and definitely by the municipal elections of 1866. The members of Kämbel originally comprised the small traders and merchants of the medieval city of Zürich, among them the gardeners (vegetable traders), lubricators and food merchants, all commonly called Grempler from which the name of the guild is derived. In later years, the vine transporters (Wynzügel) and salt traders (Houw) also became members of the guild. In addition to the aforementioned duties, the guild's deans as representatives of the city council, had to supervise the sale of goods produced by the Kämbel members, and the deans also had to define rules and conditions, and they oversaw the food stands under the arches (German: Unter den Bögen) on Limmatquai and at Weinplatz (and Gmüesbrugg, Swiss German for Vegetable bridge), passing among others the Constaffel, Saffran and Zimmerleuten guild houses. Hans Waldmann monument on occasion of the Sechseläuten ceremony 2015 The most important guild master (dean) of Kämbel was Hans Waldmann (1435–1489), mayor of Zürich from 1482 to 1489, who was executed during the so-called Waldmannhandel. The equestrian monument in front of the Fraumünster church at the Münsterhof plaza respectively at the Münsterbrücke was created by Hermann Haller. The monument was unveiled on 6 April 1937 by the Kämbel guild, aiming to rehabilitate Hans Waldmann who they proposed had been the victim of a judicial murder. The equestrian statue became the subject of controversy for artistic, political and historical reasons.  Sechseläuten  The \\"Arabian\\"-costumed members of the guild at the Bürkliplatz plaza in 2015 Like the other Zürich guilds, except the women members of the Fraumünster society which participate just as \\"guests\\", the members of the Kämbel guild participate in Sechseläuten. The Kämbel horse riders orbit the Böögg at Sechseläutenplatz as wild and disorderly crowd in Arabian-style costumes as a reference to their coat of arms which shows a camel — the German term Kamel sounds like Kämbel.  Activities  The association organizes monthly meetings, publishes a New Year's sheet, and its members are involved in numerous cultural projects.

It was founded in 2014 by members of the Egyptian Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance Administration and has grown to become one of Egypt's largest political parties. , the party chairman was Ashraf Rashad. The party has been described by some commentators as similar in nature to the National Democratic Party which ruled Egypt under Hosni Mubarak due to the uncompromising support the party gives to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has been described by international media as authoritarian, as well as the connections some members of the party have to high-ranking officials in Sisi's government. History Nation's Future Party was set up in mid-2014 by the Egyptian Military Intelligence. Former member of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's presidential campaign Abdel Azim stated, A student responsible for Nation's Future Party campaigning in his governorate was interviewed by Mada Masr. He stated that a Military Intelligence officer in civilian clothes frequently delivered cash payments of typically to the campaign office, and later on cheques, including one from the National Bank of Egypt for . For each street march, to would be delivered, and young men organised by government agencies would be paid each to participate in the marches. Instead of being run by volunteers, the campaign office was staffed by civil servants. Campaigning for signatures for Sisi's presidential candidacy by Nation's Future Party included payments of to each person signing. Party leader Mohamed Badran took his instructions, according to the interviewee, from Major Ahmed Shaaban of Military Intelligence. The party attracted Egyptian youths who wanted to bring change to the political atmosphere from traditional policies of seniority according to age. In recent months, however, many established parliamentarians, many of whom were members of the now-dissolved National Democratic Party, joined the party. The Nation's Future Party is officially the second-largest political party in the Egyptian parliament, having won 53 seats in the 2015 Egyptian parliamentary election. It is, however, deemed to be the largest party in parliament due to the unofficial resignation of more than 50 members of parliament from their respective parties in favour of joining the Nation's Future Party. 2015 parliamentary election  The Future of the Nation Party ran in the 2015 parliamentary elections as part of the \\"For the Love of Egypt\\" electoral alliance, which won all 120 party seats in the parliament. It was subsequently allocated 53 seats in parliament, making it the second-largest party after the Free Egyptians Party that won 65 seats, and ahead of the New Wafd Party, Egypt's oldest political party. 2018 presidential election In 2018, after all political parties, except for the Ghad Party led by Moussa Mostafa Moussa, failed to field candidates for the presidential election in March that year, calls to merge Egypt's 104 political parties into four or five strong parties increased. In response, efforts to strengthen the presence of powerful parties in the Egyptian political scene, primarily led by the Free Egyptians Party, the Future of the Nation Party, and the New Wafd Party—as well as the Support Egypt Coalition, which holds 400 out of 597 seats in the Egyptian parliament—began. In April 2018, the Support Egypt Coalition announced it would seek to merge all of its constituent parties into one new party, which would then hold a parliamentary majority. This, however, presented two main obstacles: * Article 6 of the 2014 House of Representatives Law allows stripping membership of any member of parliament who changes the political affiliation by which they were elected, provided there is a 2/3 majority parliamentary vote in support of this. * Many political parties within the coalition rejected the idea of dissolving their own parties in favour of this new party, in particular, the Future of the Nation Party, which is the largest party in the coalition. Growth In April 2018, the \\"For the Sake of Egypt\\" alliance, which was the largest and most organized civilian campaign set up to support President Sisi in his campaign for a second term in office, announced plans to become a political party. This did not happen; in May 2018, the Future of the Nation Party and the \\"For the Sake of Egypt\\" alliance made a surprise announcement in a joint press conference that the alliance would merge into the party and that the party's official name would be changed at the Annual Party Conference in October 2018 to the Future of Egypt Party. Following the announcement, around 50 MPs resigned from their parties and joined the Future of the Nation Party; most of these came from the Free Egyptians and Wafd parties but there were many independents and other party members.. It was estimated that 75 parliamentarians joined the party but until the House of Representatives Law is changed to allow the switching of parties, none of the MPs have officially notified the Speaker of the House that they have changed parties for fear of being stripped of their parliamentary memberships. Thus the Future of the Nation Party is currently unofficially Egypt's largest party in parliament. Policies =The Egyptian Armed Forces= The party has always supported the Egyptian Armed Forces, believing Egyptians need to unite behind the Army and the Police Force in their fight against terrorism in defence of the nation. It is firmly opposed to the deployment of Egyptian troops in Syria, asserting that the Egyptian Armed Forces should only protect Egypt and that it is not in Egypt's interest to get involved in the armed conflict in Syria. =Economic reforms= The Future of the Nation Party has always supported the President in regards to economic reforms. They supported the subsidy cuts on fuel, electricity and water, and are strong supporters of the New Investment Law and the liberalization of the Egyptian Pound. Party leaders have often stated their support for the IMF- backed economic reform program, believing it is the only way to help Egypt recover from the effects of the 2011 Revolution and to create a modern, powerful Egyptian state despite the resulting hardships. =Foreign affairs= The party's foreign affairs position tends to revolve around the concept that Egypt plays a pivotal role in the region and is a powerful state in an otherwise uncertain part of the world. As such, the party strongly supports diplomacy with as many nations as possible, especially in the fight against terrorism. The party has often shown support for other Arab states, particularly those within the GCC. Considering Egypt's military strength and the warm relations enjoyed with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the party has supported calls to protect the Gulf states from foreign interference, particularly from Iran. It also believes in the importance of the state's efforts to conclude the conflicts in Syria and Libya, and to reach a peaceful solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Reaching out to African states has also been a priority. The party has regularly lobbied the government to improve relations with the African continent, which were arguably non-existent for the latter part of the Mubarak era. The party regularly sends diplomatic delegations to foreign countries in preparation for state visits by the President of Egypt.

Her career encompassed numerous genres, ranging from serious opera to polka to vaudeville. Her comic performances were often in the character of Aggie Klepaczka. Biography She was an early performer on television, performing to pleasant reviews on WBKB in Chicago. In 1948 she was performing Il Trovatore while touring with the Chicago Opera Artists Association, in the role of Azucena. Here her voice was reviewed as “big, warm, dramatic”. The next year she was with the “Grand Opera Company of New York” performing in the opera Taras Bulba. The opera itself received a scathing review, but Data was again praised as someone who could “make a poor aria sound like a fairly good one”. Signed to Capitol, in 1950 she was releasing material in English on their regular pop series, and in Polish for the ethnic series. She then signed to Dana Records in 1952, and in quick secession a recording session took place in Chicago and several sides, performed In Polish, were released. Capitol Records released material by Data as part of their 1957 “Capitol of the World” campaign. In addition to her singing, she was a radio announcer, most commonly associated with WHFC, Chicago.

It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The route was designated as LA 574-10 prior to 1972, when five digit routes were eliminated by the state highway department. Louisiana Highway 3151 Louisiana Highway 3151 (LA 3151) runs in a general north-south direction along Humble Road, looping off of LA 1 in Grand Isle, Jefferson Parish. It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The route was designated as LA 574-11 prior to 1972, when five digit routes were eliminated by the state highway department. Louisiana Highway 3152 Louisiana Highway 3153 Louisiana Highway 3153 (LA 3153) ran in a north–south direction along Transcontinental Drive from US 61 (Airline Highway) to West Metairie Avenue in Metairie, Jefferson Parish. It was a divided four-lane highway for its entire length. Transcontinental Drive began as a main thoroughfare through the Bridgedale subdivision, which opened in 1925 during construction of the Airline Highway between Shrewsbury and Kenner. In 1930, it was designated as State Route 1246 in the pre-1955 Louisiana Highway system. Transcontinental Drive was intended to be extended south to Jefferson Highway (State Route 1) to connect with the Huey P. Long Bridge then in the planning stages. These plans never came to fruition, and the Bridgedale area would not be not directly connected to the bridge for almost fifty years via an extension of Clearview Parkway. State Route 1246 became LA 611-11 in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering and assumed its present number in 1972. The route was returned to local control by 1986. Louisiana Highway 3154 Louisiana Highway 3154 (LA 3154) runs in a north-south direction from LA 48 in Harahan to US 61 in Metairie, Jefferson Parish. The route initially heads north on Hickory Avenue, an undivided two-lane thoroughfare, from LA 48 (Jefferson Highway) in Harahan. At Roberts Street, signs direct traffic onto Dickory Avenue, a parallel divided four-lane thoroughfare, to continue north on LA 3154. Officially, the route leaves Hickory Avenue further north via Gardner Street (also the connector for southbound traffic), requiring a U-turn before proceeding north on Dickory Avenue. Now outside the Harahan city limits, LA 3154 intersects LA 3139 (Earhart Expressway) and proceeds across the Canadian National Railway (CN) tracks via an overpass into Metairie. The highway proceeds a short distance further to its terminus at US 61 (Airline Drive). LA 3154 was designated as LA 611-12 prior to 1972, when five digit routes were eliminated by the state highway department. The route originally followed Hickory Avenue for its entire length and crossed what was then the Illinois Central Railroad (IC) line at grade. Construction began in 1974 on a four-lane bypass of Hickory Avenue that would include a railroad overpass and an interchange with the future Earhart Expressway. The new alignment, Dickory Avenue, opened in December 1975 and extended from Citrus Road to Airline Highway (now Airline Drive). Almost two decades later, Dickory Avenue was extended slightly to the south, providing better access to the Elmwood Business Park. In 2003, a further extension continued the road to its present terminus just south of 9th Street, providing another route into the Elmwood Business Park via an extension of Mounes Street. Plans are underway to extend the road to Jefferson Highway and bypass the remainder of Hickory Avenue. Louisiana Highway 3155 Louisiana Highway 3155 (LA 3155) runs in a north–south direction along Little Farms Avenue from Russell Avenue in River Ridge to a junction with US 61 (Airline Drive) in Metairie. It crosses the Canadian National Railway line at grade at its southern end and is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Little Farms Avenue is the main thoroughfare of the J. H. Little Farms residential subdivision opened in 1925.[The Times-Picayune, 15 March 1925] The subdivision was laid out alongside the Jefferson Highway (State Route 1 in the pre-1955 Louisiana highway system) and adjacent streetcar line operated by the Orleans-Kenner Traction Company. Little Farms Avenue was soon extended across the railroad tracks to connect with the newly constructed Airline Highway.[The Times- Picayune, 15 April 1928] In 1954, the Bunche Village residential subdivision opened adjacent to Little Farms Avenue between the railroad tracks and Airline Highway.[The Times-Picayune, 16 May 1954] Little Farms Avenue was originally designated as State Route 2220 in the pre-1955 system and included the entire length of the road from Jefferson Highway to Airline Highway (now Airline Drive). It became LA 611-13 in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, but in 1972, the route was renumbered to LA 3155[The Times-Picayune, 25 November 1972] and retained only the section of Little Farms Avenue north of the railroad tracks. Louisiana Highway 3156 Louisiana Highway 3156 (LA 3156) is a short state-maintained section of Jefferson Street in downtown New Iberia within Iberia Parish. The highway begins at West St. Peter Street (carrying eastbound LA 182) and travels northeast past a church, school, and a house. After crossing West Main Street (westbound LA 182), it crosses Bayou Teche on the Joe Daigre Bridge, a swing bridge opened in 2014. State maintenance ends just past the bridge at the intersection of Front Street and Indest Street. Louisiana Highway 3158 Louisiana Highway 3158 (LA 3158) runs in a north- south direction along South Airport Road from I-12 southeast of Hammond to US 190 in Hammond, Tangipahoa Parish. The route connects I-12 (Exit 42) with the Hammond Northshore Regional Airport east of downtown Hammond. Outside of the diamond interchange with I-12, LA 3158 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. At about the midpoint of its route, LA 3158 intersects Old Covington Highway, a local road formerly designated as LA 1067. The intersection was converted from a four-way stop to a roundabout in 2010. Louisiana Highway 3159 Louisiana Highway 3160 Louisiana Highway 3160 (LA 3160) runs in an east-west direction along Home Place from LA 3127 to LA 18 in Hahnville, St. Charles Parish. The route connects Hahnville, the parish seat, with LA 3127, a highway constructed in the 1970s that bypasses the various communities along the west bank of the Mississippi River between Luling and Donaldsonville. It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3161 Louisiana Highway 3161 (LA 3161) runs in an east-west direction from LA 3235 to LA 1 in Cut Off, Lafourche Parish. The route is a short connector between LA 1 and its four-lane bypass, LA 3235. It is also signed as the Cote Blanche Connection and is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3162 Louisiana Highway 3162 (LA 3162) runs in an east-west direction from LA 3235 to LA 308 in Galliano, Lafourche Parish. The route is a short connector between LA 1 and its four-lane bypass, LA 3235. It extends east across Bayou Lafourche by way of a vertical lift bridge, connecting LA 1 and LA 308, which travel along opposite banks of the bayou. LA 3162 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3163 Louisiana Highway 3164 Louisiana Highway 3165 Louisiana Highway 3166 Louisiana Highway 3166 (LA 3166) runs in a north-south direction from a cul-de-sac alongside the Mermentau River to a junction with LA 1126 south of Jennings, Jefferson Davis Parish. Louisiana Highway 3168 Louisiana Highway 3168 (LA 3168) runs in a north-south direction from US 90 to a point just south of I-10 in Scott, Lafayette Parish. The route is entirely co-signed with LA 93. LA 3168 heads north from US 90 along Apollo Road. Upon reaching a roundabout intersection with St. Mary Street, the town's main north-south thoroughfare, the LA 3168 designation ends. LA 93 continues immediately through an interchange with I-10 at Exit 97. LA 3168 was constructed around 1979 as a truck route for LA 93, which followed St. Mary Street through the center of town. It became the actual route of LA 93 when St. Mary Street was subsequently returned to local control. However, the LA 3168 designation remains and is entirely co-signed with the portion of LA 93 on Apollo Road. Louisiana Highway 3169 Louisiana Highway 3169 (LA 3169) is an approximate highway located east of Colfax, Grant Parish. It travels between LA 8 and US 71/LA 8 through a mostly wooded area. The road has been discontinuous since October 2010 as the bridge over the Bayou Rigolette is closed. Louisiana Highway 3170 Louisiana Highway 3173 Louisiana Highway 3173 (LA 3173) runs in a general north-south direction through Krotz Springs, St. Landry Parish. The route begins at LA 105 (South Levee Road) and proceeds west along 2nd Street. It then turns north onto 9th Avenue, crosses the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks, and intersects LA 3174 (Main Street). LA 3173 turns east onto Main Street for one block then north onto 8th Avenue to an intersection with LA 3178 (Florida Street). Here, LA 3173 turns west and reaches its terminus at US 190 just west of the Krotz Springs Bridge over the Atchafalaya River. LA 3173 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The upper section of LA 3173 was formerly part of LA 105 before the construction of the current westbound bridge span caused a slight realignment of that route. LA 3173 was added to the state highway system around 1973, and its route has remained the same to the present day. Louisiana Highway 3174 Louisiana Highway 3174 (LA 3174) runs in an east-west direction along Main Street in Krotz Springs, St. Landry Parish. The route begins at US 190 and heads south briefly before curving to the east. It enters the town of Krotz Springs and proceeds to a terminus at LA 3173 (9th Avenue). LA 3174 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Truck traffic from the industrial area south of town is directed onto LA 3174 to reach westbound US 190. In the pre-1955 state highway system, LA 3174 was part of State Route 7. After the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, it became part of the original route of LA 105. LA 3174 was created when construction of the current westbound span of the Krotz Springs Bridge caused a slight realignment of LA 105 in the early 1970s. Louisiana Highway 3177 Louisiana Highway 3178 Louisiana Highway 3178 (LA 3178) runs in an east- west direction along Florida Street in Krotz Springs, St. Landry Parish. The route begins at the intersection of Florida Street and 8th Avenue, a junction with LA 3173, and proceeds east to LA 105 (North Levee Road). It provides a more direct connection between US 190 and LA 105 at the west end of the Krotz Springs Bridge over the Atchafalaya River. It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. LA 3178 connects the original and current alignments of LA 105, which was slightly realigned in the early 1970s when the current westbound span of the Krotz Springs Bridge was constructed. Louisiana Highway 3179 Louisiana Highway 3179 (LA 3179) runs in a north-south direction from LA 44 to US 61 in Reserve, St. John the Baptist Parish. Louisiana Highway 3180 Louisiana Highway 3181 Louisiana Highway 3182 Louisiana Highway 3182 (LA 3182) runs in an east-west direction from LA 182 to LA 87 in Jeanerette, Iberia Parish. It connects the two routes by way of a swing bridge across Bayou Teche constructed in 1980. Louisiana Highway 3184 Louisiana Highway 3184 (LA 3184) runs in a north-south direction from LA 3025 to I-10 in Lafayette, Lafayette Parish. It is a largely commercial corridor that connects I-10 with Cajun Field, the Cajundome Convention Center, and Lafayette's southwest suburbs. The route heads northwest on Bertrand Drive from LA 3025 then curves due north onto Ambassador Caffery Parkway. Shortly afterward, LA 3184 intersects US 90 (Cameron Street). The highway then crosses the BNSF/Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks by way of an overpass and proceeds to an interchange with I-10 at Exit 100. LA 3184 is a divided four-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3185 Louisiana Highway 3185 (LA 3185) runs in a northwest to southeast direction from LA 308 west of Thibodaux, Lafourche Parish to LA 20 in Schriever, Terrebonne Parish. The route is generally known as West Thibodaux Bypass Road. LA 3185 initially heads southwest from LA 308 (Bayou Road), immediately crossing Bayou Lafourche and intersecting LA 1. After curving to the southeast, LA 3185 crosses from Lafourche Parish into Terrebonne Parish. The highway terminates soon afterward at LA 20 in Schriever. It is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3186 Louisiana Highway 3187 Louisiana Highway 3188 Louisiana Highway 3188 (LA 3188) runs in a north-south direction from US 61 to I-10 in LaPlace, St. John the Baptist Parish. It is one of two highways that connect LaPlace to the interstate. LA 3188 heads north from US 61 (West Airline Highway) on Belle Terre Boulevard, a divided four-lane commercial thoroughfare. There are four signalized intersections along the route: US 61, a shopping strip entrance, Fairway Drive, and St. Andrews Boulevard. Just north of the latter, LA 3188 enters an undeveloped area at the north end of LaPlace. The highway curves to the northeast, engaging in a trumpet interchange with I-10 at Exit 206, connecting to New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The highway was constructed in the early 1980s and involved re-routing and extending the existing Belle Terre Boulevard to I-10. The original alignment curved northeast onto what is now Lakewood Drive, ending at the Belle Terre Country Club. Louisiana Highway 3190 Louisiana Highway 3191 Louisiana Highway 3193 Louisiana Highway 3193 (LA 3193) runs in a north-south direction from LA 44 to LA 3125 in Lutcher, St. James Parish. From the south, LA 3193 begins at LA 44, which follows the east bank levee of the Mississippi River. It proceeds northwest on Lutcher Avenue, an undivided two-lane residential thoroughfare. Just after crossing the Canadian National Railway (CN) tracks at grade, the highway intersects LA 641 (West Main Street). LA 3193 continues past St. James Parish Hospital and widens to a divided four-lane highway shortly before reaching its terminus at LA 3125. Louisiana Highway 3194 Louisiana Highway 3194 (LA 3194) runs in an east–west direction from LA 173 to the concurrent US 71/LA 1 in Shreveport. Louisiana Highway 3195 Louisiana Highway 3195 (LA 3195) runs in a north- south direction from LA 182 to the junction of LA 86 and LA 344 east of New Iberia, Iberia Parish. Louisiana Highway 3196 This is an unpaved route with no major junctions apart from its endpoints at US 425/84 and LA 569. Louisiana Highway 3197 Louisiana Highway 3197 (LA 3197) runs in a southwest to northeast direction along Bayou Black Drive between two points on LA 182 in Houma, Terrebonne Parish. It is a discontinuous remnant of the original alignment of US 90 through the area. From the southwest, LA 3197 begins at a junction with LA 182 and LA 315 at the intersection of Bayou Black Drive and Barrow Street. It proceeds northeast on Bayou Black Drive alongside the Houma Golf Course. At the intersection of Bayou Black Drive with Country Club Drive and Mulberry Road, LA 3197 turns northwest and shortly reaches a dead end at the former location of the Houma Canal bridge. The route resumes on the north side of the canal and proceeds northwest a short distance to its terminus at LA 182 (Barrow Street) opposite the concurrent LA 311 and LA 312. LA 3197 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. Louisiana Highway 3198 Louisiana Highway 3198 (LA 3198) ran in a southwest to northeast direction along what is now LA 182 connecting Raceland with US 90 in Lafourche Parish. LA 3198 was part of the original alignment of US 90 before the Raceland bypass was opened in the late 1970s. From the southwest, LA 3198 began at an interchange with US 90 (Exit 210) and LA 3052 (now also part of US 90). It proceeded northeast along the present LA 182, intersecting LA 653 and LA 652 on the way to Raceland. LA 3198 reached its terminus at LA 1 in Raceland opposite Bayou Lafourche. Louisiana Highway 3199 Louisiana Highway 3199 (LA 3199) ran in a southwest to northeast direction along what is now LA 182 connecting Raceland with US 90 in Lafourche Parish. LA 3198 was part of the original alignment of US 90 before the Raceland bypass was opened in the late 1970s. From the southwest, LA 3199 began at an intersection with LA 1 on the south side (west bank) of Bayou Lafourche. It proceeded northeast along the present LA 182, intersecting LA 307 along the northeastern tip of Raceland. LA 3199 reached its terminus shortly thereafter at US 90 alongside the BNSF/Union Pacific Railroad (UP) tracks.

Schonholz (born 1956 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is a vascular surgeon, the first in the United States to perform minimally invasive aortic aneurysm surgery (stent graft procedure) together with Drs. Frank Veith, Juan C. Parodi and Michael L. Marin. Education Schonholz was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He attended the National College of Buenos Aires, but graduated with honors from the University of Buenos Aires in 1980. Following it, he did residency in diagnostic radiology as well as in angiography and interventional radiology at the Centre Cardiologuique du Nord in Paris, France. While there, he worked with professors Michel Tonnelier and Francis Besse and helped them with the development of digital subtraction angiography. Career Dr. Schonholz eventually became private practitioner in his hometown with a team of physicians that specialize in interventional cardiology and neurosurgery. During one such days, Schonholz and his colleague, Luis Augusto Lemme Plaghos, introduced many neurointerventional procedures in Argentina such as brain embolization to cure arteriovenous malformation. In 1989, Schonholz met with Juan C. Parodi in a nearby hospital where Parodi worked as a vascular surgeon. Dr. Parodi suggested him to join his project on stent graft which he plans to use on patients who are in higher risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysms. Knowing Dr. Schonholz's work on carotid angioplasty, they merged forces in 1990 and became the first team of physicians to use stent graft to treat a human with abdominal aortic aneurysm. The novel procedure was performed at the Buenos Aires Cardiovascular Institute, and was later proven to be innovative and minimally invasive. Their invention was so unique to the world, that Dr. Schonholz and his team were invited to Nancy, France where they met with Michel Henry and Max Amor and demonstrated their invention at the 2nd International Course of Peripheral Vascular Intervention. In 1992, Schonholz and his team went to the Montefiore Medical Center at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York where they joined Frank Veith and Michael L. Marin to perform first stent graft procedure in the United States. In 2000, Schonholz joined the Department of Radiology at Louisiana State University and later became its director of vascular and interventional radiology. Four years later, Dr. Schonholz joined the faculty of the Department of Radiology of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina where he still works at its Heart and Vascular Center.

She made three voyages transporting convicts from India to Australia and was wrecked upon the Coromandel Coast in 1840. Career Under the command of James Rapson, she left Calcutta 20 December 1837 for Australia. She was the first ship to sail under the auspices of the Australian Association of Bengal (aka Bengal-Australia Association). She arrived at the Swan River Colony on 13 February 1838, bringing the first Indian hill coolies to arrive at the colony. A more detailed reckoning states that she landed 13 British men, one Chinese, and 37 lascars. She also landed Indian buffaloes, building supplies, 20 bags of rice, and barrels of ghee. She then sailed via King Georges's Sound and Adelaide, and reached Hobart Town on 22 March; she arrived at Sydney on 30 March 1838 with passengers, eighteen convicts, and sundry items. On her second convict voyage under the command of James Rapson, she left Calcutta and sailed via Madras and Hobart Town. She arrived at Sydney on 27 December 1838 with passengers, one convict, and cargo. For her third convict voyage again under the command of James Rapson, she left Calcutta on 16 June 1839.

It has been called the first of this type of attraction, having first opened to the public in October 2004. Description Each location features interactive adventures with themes such as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, a high tech spy mission, outer space, ancient Egypt, and medieval fantasy. In each adventure, a group of 2-12 guests are faced with puzzles and challenges they must overcome as a team as they work to progress through a series of rooms and complete their mission. There are computer controlled lighting and sound effects, optical illusions, and a wide variety of physical and mental puzzles and electromechanical effects. Guests can succeed or fail, and each adventure has multiple endings that will change based on how the group performs and what decisions the group makes.5 Wits at Destiny USA will feature four attractions by the end of next year Syracuse.com.

The Foxboro, MA location at Patriot Place is unique in that it is the only location where a staff member, called 'adventure guide' goes with the group to help set the tone and if the group gets stuck, can provide clues. The adventures in Foxboro last approximately 50 minutes based on the group's ability to solve the challenges. The other 5 Wits locations all provide automated adventures, where the guides do not accompany guests through. The adventures in these locations last approximately 30 minutes based on the group's ability to solve the challenges. =Adventures= * Deep Space (Syracuse, West Nyack, Albany, Buffalo) - A futuristic adventure where adventure goers get teleported to an abandoned starship and they must work together to figure out what happened to the crew, but not everything is what it seems. * Drago's Castle (Syracuse, West Nyack, Albany, Buffalo, Erie, Arlington) - A medieval fantasy where adventure goers help a magical princess catch a fire-breathing dragon before it can destroy her world and theirs. * Espionage (Foxboro, Syracuse, Erie, Arlington) - A spy adventure where adventure goers become secret agents and must infiltrate the bad guy's base and foil his plans. The Espionage adventures are very different with Foxboro's involving a bomb, while Syracuse, Arlington, and Plymouth Meeting have missiles that must be disarmed. * Tomb (Syracuse, West Nyack, Albany, Buffalo, Erie, Arlington) - An Indiana Jones style adventure where adventure goers must answer the riddles of a long dead pharaoh or else be trapped forever. * 20,000 Leagues (Foxboro) - Based on the book by Jules Verne, the group must repair a broken down submarine and battle a sea monster to reach the surface.  Origin of the Name  5 Wits is named after the five inward wits from the writings of William Shakespeare and Stephen Hawes. These five wits were common sense, imagination, estimation, fantasy, and memory, though there are also clear associations to the five senses. Each 5 Wits adventure requires the use of the five inward wits and is designed to immerse guests fully in a \\"5 senses themed\\" experience.  History  5 Wits was incorporated in 2003 by founder and president Matthew DuPlessie. The original business plan for 5 Wits, first called the Puzzle Room, was written and entered into the business plan competition at Harvard Business School in early 2003. 5 Wits' first location opened in October 2004 at 186 Brookline Avenue, Boston MA, hosting TOMB, 5 Wits first adventure. In 2006, 5 Wits spun off a sister company, Box Fort , (originally called 5 Wits Productions) to design and build walk-through adventures for its growing business and provide services for third-party clients like museums, theaters, and theme parks. In 2007, 5 Wits opened Operation Spy, an hour long walk-through adventure inside the International Spy Museum. In 2010, 5 Wits moved the original TOMB adventure to Pigeon Forge, TN, selling it to a third party. The original TOMB continues to operate but is no longer owned or operated by 5 Wits. Meanwhile, a new 5 Wits location opened in August of that same year in Foxboro MA at Patriot Place hosting Espionage and 20,000 Leagues. Since then, multiple new locations have opened, primarily in New York state. 5 Wits continues to expand, with new stores currently planned.

Her works include What the Moon Brought and a series of stories featuring K'Tonton, a boy the size of a thumb who has adventures which feature Jewish holidays and culture. The K'Tonton stories \\"exemplified both Conservative Jewish and broadly humanistic values.\\" Throughout her life, she was a Zionist, advocating for a Jewish homeland, and an environmentalist. Early life Weilerstein was born in Rochester, New York. Her parents Bernard and Tillie Rose were Jewish Lithuanian immigrants who kept a kosher home. They had emigrated to America about 10 years before she was born. In America, Bernard owned a factory, and Tillie was involved in Hadassah and the Women's Suffrage movement, working with Susan B. Anthony. Rose Weilerstein had three sisters and a brother. After graduating from the University of Rochester, she was a teacher at the Rochester School for the Deaf. In 1920, she married B. Rueben Weilerstein, a rabbi, and the couple moved to Brooklyn for a time before settling in Atlantic City. The couple had a son and three daughters to whom she would tell stories. Career Weilerstein's mother delivered samples of her writing to the publisher Bloch. Her first book, What Danny Did (1928) was published six months later to good reviews. In 1930, she published the first in a series of stories about K'tonton, a boy who is the size of a thumb, in the Jewish magazine Ourlook. The stories were collected into a book, The Adventures of K'tonton, in 1930 which was illustrated by Jeannette Berkowitz. Dick: the Horse That Kept the Sabbath published in 1955 tells the story of a Jewish family living in the city whose horse, Dick, gets injured and is then taken to a Gentile family in the country where he will not have to walk on the hard pavement. The family promises to allow Dick to continue the Jewish practice of not working on the Sabbath. In 1961 she published the story Ten and a Kid, inspired by her mother's stories of growing up in a Jewish shtetl in Lithuania and illustrated by Janina Domanska. Ten and a Kid was aimed at a slightly older audience of elementary school children. K'tonton in Israel presents Israel as \\"an old-new land existing in harmonious balance, where Bedouin hospitality evokes the open tent of the biblical patriarch Abraham while kibbutzniks make the desert bloom.\\" In 1976, she wrote another K'tonton book, K'tonton on an Island in the Sea which showcases her lifelong love of nature and growing interest in environmentalism. The book was illustrated by Mike Berenstain. Rose Weilerstein was part of the successful campaign to create Atlantic City's children's nature preserve. Selected K'tonton stories were republished in a 50th anniversary collection called The Best of K'tonton in 1980 with new illustrations by Marilyn Hirsh. The Best Jewish Books for Children and Teens said that many of the stories seem \\"outdated\\" but tradition of American stories for children about Jewish holidays had \\"come into their own\\" through Weilerstein's K'tonton books and that the author and stories played a \\"central role in the literary heritage of American Jewish children.\\" In the 1990s, several of the K'tonton stories from the collections were published as stand- alone nursery books.

The church is situated in the neighbourhood Viby, west of Marselisborg. It is a parish church which belongs to the Church of Denmark and there's population of 8.211 within the parish borders (2015).  History  Viby church was built in the late 12th century and was likely originally the property of the king. In 1661 the state elected to sell the church to Gabriel Marselis in order to pay off war debts. In 1710 the church was sold again, this time to Christian Charisius, who owned Constantinsborg. In 1771 the baron of Marselisborg bought it and the church stayed with the Marselisborg estate until Minister of the Interior Hans Peter Ingerslev acquired the estate in 1835. The church was sold to Aarhus Municipality in 1896 and two years later, in 1898, it was given to Viby Municipality. In 1970 Viby Municipality was absorbed into Aarhus municipality but 5 years later, in 1975, the church was made an independent entity within the Church of Denmark, although Aarhus municipality continued to administer the cemetery until 1 April 1996.  Architecture  It is probable that the king had the patronage of Viby church in the Middle Ages. The church, which is now situated in a neighbourhood of Arhus, consists of Romanesque apse, chancel and nave with two late-Medieval additions: the porch in the south and the tower in the west. The Romanesque sections are built of rough and hewn granite boulders on a chamfered base; ashlar were used in the corners and around the windows and doors. Between 1449 and 1482 vaults were included in chancel and nave. In the masonry of the tower a quantity of re-used granite ashlar is included which may have been brought here from a demolished church. The spire, which is in a mansard style, was erected in 1785. The present-day appearance of the church is characterized by a restoration in 1962, during which wall-painting decoration in the usual late Gothic style of the diocese was revealed in all the vaulting. Among the articles of furniture in the church, the pulpit from c. 1610 deserves special mention. It is ascribed to the woodcarver Mikkel van Grønningen in Hornslet, who supplied works both for Aarhus Cathedral and several East Jutland churches, including Trige. The altarpiece and altar candlesticks were also obtained in the first half of the 17th century, while the Romanesque baptismal font was retained as usually happened. The greater part of the furniture, which showed the church's former close relationship with the Constantinsborg and Marselisborg estates, has now disappeared, and only a chasuble cross from about 1700 has been preserved. The clockwork in the tower is from the beginning of the 19th century. In the cemetery tombstones from the 17th century indicate the graves of clergy belonging to the same family.

The term was coined by John Shannon of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in the 1960s. There are currently 18 states who use a wide scope of programs to relieve the property tax burden for low income individuals and families. Just as an electrical circuit breaker will prevent an electric circuit from being overloaded with energy, these programs prevent low income households from being overloaded with tax burden. Like all tax refunds, these programs require low income households to pay the entire property tax up-front then a credit or refund is given during the income tax processing. A popular feature of the property tax circuit breaker is that rather than limiting the amount of money someone pays in property taxes, relief is given after the property taxes are paid. This is done so that the locality who is in charge of levying the taxes and utilizing the revenue does not see a decrease in revenue from property taxes, rather the state government passes down relief for those property taxes that are paid.  Types of Property Tax Circuit Breakers  Threshold Circuit Breakers: Threshold circuit breakers are the most popular type utilizing a specific threshold percentage that property taxes must exceed before any tax relief is available. With this type of circuit breaker relief would be equal to the amount of property taxes paid above the threshold. There are single-threshold formulas where a single threshold is established to focus on tax relief, and there is also multiple-threshold formulas where the relief can be applied more progressively in an incremental fashion. The multiple-threshold formula is more common than the single-threshold formula. Sliding Scale Circuit Breakers: These circuit breakers utilize income brackets to formulate a reduction in property taxes regardless of the amount of property tax. The tax relief will be the same within each tax bracket and will decrease incrementally with each increase in the income bracket so that those with the lowest of incomes will receive the highest of property tax reductions. An example of this method would be: A 50% reduction for the first $10,000 income, a 40% reduction for the next $5,000 income, a 30% reduction for the next $5,000 in income. This sliding scale would eventually stop at a certain income level where a property tax reduction would possibly be deemed unnecessary.  Eligibility for Property Tax Circuit Breaker  There are currently 18 different programs that provide property tax relief in the United States. The programs and their eligibility vary by state. The states with these programs limit eligibility in three ways; whether the tax payer is a renter or a homeowner, whether the tax payer is elderly or disabled, and the income level of the tax payer. Circuit breakers are offered to renters and homeowners in 16 states, only home owners in 1 state and only renters in 1 state; in 8 states the programs are limited to only the elderly or disabled and in all 18 states there is a maximum income level after which a taxpayer no longer qualifies for a refund. Although some states have a much more generous income ceiling, participation in these programs is limited by a requirement that the property tax liability be a certain percentage of the taxpayers yearly income. In turn, it is believed by researchers that this type of tax relief is more beneficial to low income families rather than middle or high income families. = Examples of Eligibility by State = * Washington, D.C.: Both renters and home-owners are eligible for the program as long as they meet certain income and residency guidelines, and if their property taxes exceed a certain share of their income. The income ceiling is $40,000 and will be increased to $50,000 in 2016. Residents over the age of 70 who make less than $60,000 per year will be eligible. In order to claim this credit the tax filer must be a resident for the full year. The maximum credit is $1,000 dollars and for filers who make less than $25,000 per year the property tax must be over 3% of their yearly income. For tax filers who make between $25,000 and $40,000 the property tax must be over 4% of their yearly income. For those over the age of 70 who make under $60,000 per year the property tax must exceed 3% of their yearly income. Renters may claim 20% of their yearly rent paid as property tax but may only receive up to the maximum $1,000 for the credit. * Illinois: Elderly and the disabled were the only two groups that could qualify for the property tax circuit breaker program in the state of Illinois. The guidelines for eligibility were set by income with $27,610 being the maximum income for a single person household, $36,635 for two people, and $45,657 for three or more people. This program also enabled renters to qualify for aid as well, including nursing home patients. As of fiscal year 2013, Illinois has ended its property tax circuit breaker program and has instead relied upon the Homestead exemption for property tax relief. * Maine: Both homeowners and renters can qualify for the program here, which is based on yearly income as well as the percentage of income tax paid and certain residency requirements. Applicants must be a Maine resident for any time during the tax year and the income guidelines are based on a tier system as follows: $33,333 for a household of one, $43,333 for a household of two and $53,333 for a household of three or more. The income ceiling will be adjusted for cost of living by the year. To qualify for the program the applicant must have paid more than 6% of their yearly income in property tax, or 40% of their yearly income in rent. The return will be 50% of the total paid over 6% of the yearly income and is capped at $600. In Maine even people who live in subsidized housing can qualify for the program. * Maryland: Only property owners can qualify for the program in Maryland, which has a unique formula for eligibility and calculating the actual credit itself. This program also takes total net worth as a factor. In Maryland an applicant must be the owner of the property and it must be their principle dwelling for at least 6 months out of the year including July 1. An applicants total net worth must be less than $200,000 not including the value of the property and an applicants household income must be less than $60,000 per year. The formula used to calculate the value of the tax credit is based on an incremental increase in income compared to the percentage of income used to pay for property tax. For those making less than $8,000 a year the credit will be the full value of what is paid in property tax, then it is 4% for those making between $8,000 and $12,000 per year, 6.5% for those making between $12,000 and $16,000 per year, and 9% for those making between $16,000 and $60,000. The credit is for those who pay more than the threshold percentage assigned to their level of income. An example would be, if an applicant made $10,000 and paid $480 in property taxes, the applicant would be eligible for a credit of $80 as long as they meet the other requirements. * Oklahoma: Applicants in Oklahoma must be a property owner over the age of 65 and file as the head of the household. The applicant must have lived in Oklahoma for the entire calendar year before filing for the credit and they must have a yearly household income under $12,000. The refund is equal to either $200 or the amount of property tax paid subtracted subtracted by the property tax cap which is set at 1% of the household income, whichever is less.

Biography Cupp was born into a musical family in Nashville, Arkansas. His father was a drummer and ukulele player, while his mother played piano, and his siblings also sang. At age five, Cupp began to perform in the family band, accompanying them on guitar or the banjo. In 1951, he was awarded a weekly radio broadcast on KVMA Radio after winning a musical talent show, following in the footsteps of his mother, Ruth, who also was a radio personality. In 1953, Cupp and his family moved to Texarkana where he enrolled at Arkansas High School, and teamed up with Elvis Presley-sound-alike Cheesie Nelson to form a locally popular country duo. During this time, the duo was enlisted by a promoter to perform in replacement for Presley until he managed to arrive for the remainder of the show. Following their performance, Cupp walked backstage, meeting Elvis, and becoming enamored in rockabilly music. Cupp worked as a solo act, but also toured alongside Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash with Cupp recalling \\"Carl learned that I was going to do a single act. He came to me and asked if it would be OK if he went on stage with me. He thought I would sound better with some kind of band backing me. I was thrilled by the thought but couldn't believe that one of the headlinners of the show would do such a favor. Well, Carl did go out with me as well as Johnny's bass man, Marshall Grant. We did my songs as if we had been together for ever\\". Afterwards, Cupp formed a more permanent backing band known as Pat Cupp and the Flying Saucers, which included his mother Ruth (piano), J.O. Livsey (drums), Pete Waller (bass guitar), and Johnny Gatlin (lead guitar). In April 1956 Cupp was signed to recording contract with RPM Records after an appearance on the Louisiana-based television program Louisiana Hayride. In May 1956, Cupp and the Flying Saucers recorded \\"Do Me No Wrong\\" and \\"Baby Come Back\\" at KWKH Radio in Shreveport, Louisiana. The songs were released on the group's debut single, which became a regional hit and was followed by an appex of touring. However, for Cupp's second single \\"Long Gone Daddy\\" record producers ordered him to record with a R&B; group, which consequently performed disappointingly upon release. Frustrated with the change of his style and backing band, Cupp joined the U.S. Air Force in 1957 to avoid further commitments outlined on his recording contract. After being honorably discharged in 1961, performing became a hobby for Cupp as he started a career as a technical engineer and married his high school sweetheart, Loretta Gaye Michael. Cupp formed a jazz band called the Variables that released one single, \\"After All\\", in 1967 on the independent record label, Chance. In October 1995, he performed for the last time at Hernsby, England, before retiring as a consequence of a hearing impairment that had been on-going since 1988.

The first operation was conducted in Khurmur, Handwara, on 23 August 2015 and resulted in the elimination of three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists. He then volunteered for second operation in Rafiabad. The operation, which lasted over two days, led to the elimination of three Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists and the capture of one terrorist, Sajjad Ahmad alias Abu Ubed Ullah. Goswami's last operation was on 3 September 2015, where he was part of an ambush team. He was injured during the gunfight and succumbed to his wounds, but not before killing two and wounding another two terrorists. Goswami's body was flown by an Indian Air Force aircraft to Bareilly, from where it was taken by an army helicopter to Pantnagar and on to his birthplace. He was cremated with full military honours in his native village. Ashok Chakra Mohan Nath Goswami's wife receives the Ashok Chakra from president Pranab Mukherjee on 26 January 2016.

It was released on April 8, 2015, as their ninth single under Warner Music Japan and 12th single overall in Japan. The song was conceived by guitarist Lee Jong- hyun in midst of the CNBLUE 2014 Arena Tour \\"Wave\\" concerts. The song was written by band members Lee Jong-hyun and Jung Yong-hwa, in addition to miwa. Portraying a message of hope, \\"White\\" combines the band's rock style and infuses a synthesizer to create a sound distinctive from the band's previous work. The single was released in four editions: Regular Edition, Limited Editions A and B, and a fan club-only Boice Limited Edition. \\"White\\" debuted on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart at number four and has sold over 28,000 copies since its release. The band embarked on the CNBLUE Spring Live 2015 \\"White\\" arena tour, where they held three concerts in Osaka and Kanagawa. The final show of the tour was recorded, spawning a live DVD and Blu-ray release in August 2015. \\"White\\" was included on the band's sixth Japanese studio album Colors. Background After the release of CNBLUE's fifth Japanese studio album Wave in September 2014, band member Lee Jong-hyun began forming ideas of releasing a single that slightly deviated from the band's music. He consulted his bandmates regarding the notion, but he \\"didn't think very seriously about it\\". He felt that it was a natural progression as a musician. He began working on the song during the CNBLUE 2014 Arena Tour \\"Wave\\" concerts and continued to work on the song during the 2014 FNC Kingdom in Japan: Starlight concerts, among various other opportunities. In creating the composition, he wanted to avoid making more sad songs and set out to make a \\"fun\\" song for live performances. He first began by playing a full phrase on a guitar before implementing different arrangements on a computer. \\"White\\" was announced as CNBLUE's ninth single on March 7, 2015, with a release date of April 8. Composition \\"White\\" was written by band members Lee Jong-hyun and Jung Yong-hwa, with additional songwriting by miwa. The song was composed by Lee Jong-hyun, Ryo, and Go Jin-young, and arranged by Tomozaku Miura and Jun \\"Silky Voice\\" Inoue. It is an uptempo electronic rock song that incorporates a synthesizer; the lyrics deliver a \\"positive message about leading one's life, like trying to fill a blank map\\". In an interview with Excite Japan, Lee Jong- hyun articulated, \\"Light has three primary colors, but doesn't light become white by combining different colors? However, by combining various colors, it becomes black, too. So, keeping that in mind, isn't everyone turning dark when overthinking lately? So, 'let's be the light!', that is the theme.\\" \\"White\\" steers from the band's typical musical style. Bassist Lee Jung-shin sensed an \\"exceptional transformation\\", noting a change in ambiance from Lee Jong-hyun's previous work. Drummer Kang Min-hyuk said that he was \\"surprised\\" that Lee Jong-hyun \\"challenged new things\\". Both members cited Lee Jong-hyun's history of writing ballads as source of their astonishment for the new sound. Vocalist Jung Yong-hwa observed the change as well, finding that the repetitious synthesizer was \\"quite appealing\\". Lee Jong-hyun expressed that he did not intend to surprise his listeners with the song, but described that the feeling came naturally afterward. The single was accompanied by two coupling tracks. \\"Stay Sober\\" was written by Jung Yong-hwa, who also composed the song alongside Hong In-ho. It was arranged by Park Hyun-woo and Kim Jae-yang, with an additional guitar and bass provided by Lee Tae-wook and Go Jin-young, respectively. \\"Irony\\" was written by Lee Jong-hyun and Ryo, with the music being composed by the former. It was arranged by Park Hyun-woo and Ryo, with additional guitar and bass provided by Jung Jae-pil and Go Jin-young, respectively. Release and promotion A 30-second preview of the music video for \\"White\\" was uploaded on Warner Music Japan's YouTube channel on March 13, 2015. The full music video was uploaded on March 20. It is set in a cafe that exudes an \\"exotic atmosphere\\". The band is joined by an unidentified elderly man who plays a character referred to as White Man. The quintet make up Team White and they perform together throughout the video. \\"White\\" was released on April 8, 2015, in four editions: Regular Edition; Limited Edition A with bonus DVD content that includes multi-angle performance footage of \\"Ring\\", \\"Go Your Way\\", and \\"Lonely Night\\" from the CNBLUE 2014 Arena Tour \\"Wave\\" concert that took place at the Osaka-jō Hall, the music video for the single, and a special feature; Limited Edition B with bonus DVD content that includes performance footage of \\"Ryu Can Do It\\", \\"In My Head\\", \\"Wake Up\\", and \\"Coffee Shop\\" from the first half of the band's set at the 2014 Summer Sonic Festival; and Boice Limited Edition with bonus DVD content that includes performance footage of \\"I'm Sorry\\", \\"Lady\\", and \\"Can't Stop\\" from the second half of the band's set at the 2014 Summer Sonic Festival.

Its name is derived from cecidium and Nothofagus, the name of the host plant genus. This genus differs from Paraulax by a median vertical carina that extends from the ventral margin of the clypeus, almost reaching the ventral margin of the antennal sockets; its facial strigae radiating from the lateral clypeus; the ventral part of its clypeus is straight; a lateral, sharp occipital carina is present; its last antennal flagellomere is 1.5 to 1.7 times longer than wide; longitudinal costulae running from the lateral margin of its pronotal plate to the lateral surface of its pronotum are very short or absent altogether; notauli are sinuate; no scutellar foveae are present; simple claws, sometimes carrying a short basal lobe. Description Its head is slightly pubescent, with some long, scattered setae on the upper frons, vertex and face. Its gena is not expanded behind its compound eye. A vertical median carina is present, while facial strigae that radiate from its clypeus extend laterally. Its clypeus has a straight ventral margin that does not project over its mandibles. It possesses a subocular impression, and 5 to 7 vertical carinae ventrolaterally on its gena. Anterior tentorial pits are visible; occiput without dorsal occipital carina. The female antenna is composed of 12 segments, its flagellum broadening towards its apex. The last flagellomere is broader than the penultimate, with a rounded end. The male antenna possesses 15 segments, with a flagellum that does not broaden towards the apex. Its pronotum's dorsal part is distinctly set off; admedian pronotal depressions are widely separated. The lateral surface of the pronotum is coriaceous. The mesoscutum is almost wholly smooth. Some long setae are scattered along the notauli, which are percurrent and well separated posteriorly. Anteroadmedian signa is visible, and the transscutal fissure is narrow. The mesopleuron is located beneath the mesopleural triangle and carries a marked, longitudinal impression. Its metapleural sulcus meets the posterior margin of the mesopectus at mid height of the metapectal-propodeal complex. Nucha exhibit some irregular longitudinal rugae dorsally. Its profemur shows ventral swelling in its basal third, with 4–5 rows of sharp. It possesses a simple metatarsal claw. It presents a radial cell along the anterior margin of its forewing; an areolet is absent. There is a fringe of long setae along the apical margin of its wing. Its abdominal petiole is dorsally smooth, with deep, longitudinal grooves ventrally. Distribution This genus of fly can be found in Chile and Argentina, following the distribution of the host plants, Nothofagus dombeyi and Nothofagus pumilio. Behaviour The three species of Cecinothofagus inhabit galls induced by Aditrochus species on Nothofagus. Cecinothofagus species are thought not to be the gall inducers but rather parasitoids of the Aditrochus larvae. The adult Cecinothofagus is observed to emerge from the solitary central host cell.

Grade-taking was the system of leadership in pre-colonial societies of northern Vanuatu, typically involving the killing of valuable pigs; it is still actively practiced in some areas. With each grade, a participant acquires a named rank, and the right to display certain insignia or perform certain rituals. The specifics vary between cultures. Lower grades are typically taken in one's youth and involve the killing of only one or a few low-value pigs. However, at the highest grades hundreds of pigs may be killed, including valuable 'tusker boars'. Although there is a clear hierarchy of grades, they do not necessarily need to be taken in strict sequence, and individuals with sufficient resources may occasionally skip grades and move directly to higher levels. Grade-taking is primarily a male activity, but in some areas there are parallel grade-taking systems practiced by women. Grade-taking and chiefdom The concept of a \\"chief\\" - an individual with specific authority over a community, rather than a ranked assortment of men with varying degrees of power and influence, was introduced to Vanuatu following contact with Europeans. Having a high rank in the grade-taking system is not technically the same as being a chief, though the two concepts are widely conflated, and chiefs tend to be individuals of high rank in the grade-taking system. Individuals of high rank in grade-taking societies generally wield authority only within their own local communities. Although some may sit as representatives on national and regional Councils of Chiefs, there is no traditional concept of a \\"paramount chief\\" with authority over an entire region. Grade-taking by area = Torres and Banks Islands = In the languages of the Torres and Banks Islands, the grade-taking system is known under various names, all descended from a same root *suᵐbʷe.See p.234-235 of . The spelling suqe [] is more frequent in the literature, due to the special attention given to the Mota language since works by Codrington. = Malekula = On the island of Malekula the grade-taking system is known as nimangki, and in some areas it is extremely elaborate, with up to 35 grades. = Pentecost Island = Grade-taking is actively practised in Anglican and Catholic areas on Pentecost Island, and in traditional kastom villages, although it has been suppressed in areas dominated by the Churches of Christ. On Pentecost the practice has no special name, but is referred to simply by terms such as \\"pig business\\". In North and Central Pentecost, the titles of the main grades are Tari, Mol or Moli, Liwus or Livusi, and Vii or Vira. There are multiple steps within some of these grades. Each grade is conferred at a ceremony in which the grade is 'bought' from an individual who already holds that rank. With each grade, a man acquires an additional name (known in Raga as ihan boe \\"pig name\\"), which reflects his rank. For example, a man who has taken the Mol grade may be given a name such as Molbaga, Moltoo or Molbwet. Depending on the grade, he may also acquire the right to wear certain insignia and the right to dance to certain drumbeats. A Vii or Vira is a man of significant authority - loosely, a \\"chief\\" - who has the right to impose fines on others. In Central Pentecost those who reach the very top level of the graded society are referred to as Tanmwonok (literally \\"ground finishing\\"); those who do so with resources still to spare are known as Mwariak (\\"remaining\\"). In addition, there is parallel grade-taking hierarchy for women, culminating in the rank of Motaa or Motari. The system in South Pentecost is broadly similar although the details of the grades differ.

Her work \\"consists of monumental paintings [which are] thickly painted, torn, collaged, spattered, sponged, sprinkled with glitter and infused with a spirit of love of nature and art,\\" the art critic Sue Taylor has written. After graduating with a Master of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Michod moved to Chicago in 1969 and joined a tight-knit community of artists which included Judy Chicago, Vera Klement, Phyllis Bramson, Margaret Wharton, Richard Loving, Robert Kushner and Nancy Spero. She taught art at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. In 1973, Michod co-founded the non-profit women artists' collaborative Artemisia Gallery. Like the groundbreaking A.I.R. Gallery in New York which opened just a year earlier, Artemisia was a forum for women to exhibit their art away from the male-dominated gallery scene. Judy Chicago, Miriam Schapiro, Joyce Kozloff and Nancy Spero were among the artists who exhibited their early work at Artemisia. Michod's work has been exhibited at institutions including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, the Queens Museum, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the National Academy in New York City, and it is in the collection of Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and the Illinois State Museum. In addition to Artemisia, her work was also exhibited by the Jan Cicero and Jean Albano galleries in Chicago and the Andre Zarre Gallery in New York.  Work  During the 1970s, Michod began to travel extensively to Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico City and Tucson, Arizona, studying indigenous art and pottery. Her paintings incorporated the designs found in Navajo weaving and Mayan ceramics, but her work was also influenced by the bright colors and bold visual movement of work produced by Henri Matisse and Josef Albers, among others. In 1977, John Perreault championed Michod's work when he selected it for inclusion in a groundbreaking \\"Pattern and Decoration\\" show which he curated at PS1 (now MoMAPS1) in Long Island City. In the 1980s, Michod branched away from pattern painting toward a more surrealistic style of painting incorporating found objects like toy Tonka tractors, farming equipment (plows, etc.), hair dryers, squeegees and paneled household doors. Writing in the March 1983 issue of Artforum, the critic Judith Russi Kirshner wrote that Michod's \\"orchestration of two and three-dimensional fauna objects that extend the painted characters into our space recalls the mood of Walt Disney’s Fantasia\\"; \\"fueled by [...] the accoutrements of domesticity and motherhood\\", the paintings are \\"populated by children's playthings and animated by a child's spirit of fantasy.\\" In 1997, Michod exhibited a series of paintings at the Chicago Cultural Center called \\"Fragile Landscapes\\". The paintings were based on the artist's experience living through a rare brain tumor called an oligodendroglioma that she suffered in 1992. The paintings, landscapes \\"dominated by a forest motif in neb-expressionist style\\", were hailed by the Chicago Tribune as being \\"repositories of feelings\\" in which \\"each of the forest pictures has a spectator who reacts in various ways to Michod's maelstrom of strokes and blaze of light. The figure is a stand-in for actual viewers, that is, a member of the audience; but it is also the artist herself serving us as Virgil did Dante in the forest of the Inferno, as a guide.\\" References Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American women artists Category:Artists from Toledo, Ohio Category:Pratt Institute alumni ","title":"Susan Michod"},{"id":"47772440","text":"Petar Radojičić (born May 17, 1994) is a Serbian basketball player.

The protests were called to end alleged segregation in off-campus university owned residential properties. Events =Dialogue= Chicago Maroon on January 17, 1962, with the headline \\"UC Admits Housing Segregation\\" According to Chicago Maroon managing editor Avima Ruder, a staffer at the student paper found a copy of the University budget, and \\"we discovered that the University owned a lot of segregated apartment buildings...It was really bizarre because our student population at that point was largely white, but there was no segregation, there weren't separate dorms for African American students—if someone had suggested that, people would have been appalled.\\" Initially foregoing publishing the news, editors gave the apartment addresses to the Student Government, who reached out to the university chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) to \\"conduct six test cases in which African American students attempted and failed to secure apartments in the segregated buildings.\\" Student Government and CORE confronted President George Beadle with their findings and demanded the buildings be desegregated. On January 17, 1962, the Maroon broke the story on the front page of the paper, with the headline, \\"UC Admits Housing Segregation.\\" Beadle wrote a letter to the paper, agreeing that the university segregation was a problem, emphasized the University's nondiscrimination policy and the difference between on-campus housing, which was open to all, and commercial residential properties acquired by the University, many of which had existing segregation policies. \\"The only issue on which there is arguable difference of opinion,\\" Beadle wrote, \\"is the rate at which it is possible to move toward the agreed objective without losing more than is gained.\\" =Protests= George Beadle and Sanders at the CORE meeting in Ida Noyes Hall, February 1962 Frustrated with Beadle's call for \\"planned, stable integration,\\" CORE activists including Bernie Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. \\"We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,\\" Sanders announced at the protest. Sanders and 32 other student activists marched into the building and camped out outside the president's office. From January 23 to February 5, Sanders and the other civil rights protesters pressured Beadle and the university to form a commission to investigate discrimination. Beadle met with 300 students in the Ida Noyes Hall theater to announce that further sit- ins would be banned and that a committee would be formed to investigate CORE's charges of racial discrimination in University-owned buildings.

The extrusion process is divided in two basic types: direct extrusion and indirect extrusion. In direct extrusion the billet is pushed through the die with ram pressure, whereas in indirect extrusion die moves relative to the container. Rule based analysis of extrusion process would help to determine set of rules essential which are essential to take care while designing a product or even during cost estimation of the product. Some of the rules are discussed below.  Material  Material of the profile to be extruded plays an essential role in determining the various process parameters and limitations of the process. For example, minimum thickness of extruded carbon steel sheet is 3mm whereas same sheet of aluminium can be extruded at minimum sheet thickness of 1mm. Variety of materials such as Carbon steel, aluminium, titanium, magnesium, ABS and PVC etc. can be manufactured via extrusion process.  Profile shape  Extrusion process can extrude sheets with a high variety of profile shapes but it is essential to take care of the profile features to ensure products feasibility and strength. = Wall thickness = When deciding the wall thickness of profile, strength and cost efficiency are two main factors. Though Uniform wall thickness is most easy to manufacture, however when necessary wall thickness can easily be varied within a profile. If changes in the wall thickness are unavoidable, make them gradual rather than abrupt. Both thick and thin cross sections should be avoided as material tend to flow faster where thicker sections occur giving rise to distortions in the extruded shape. Hence for an extrusion process wall thickness varies from 1mm (aluminium) to 32mm (PVC). = Corner Radii = Extrusion processes cannot achieve sharp corners without additional fabrication. Internal corners should be filleted with a minimum radius of 0.5-1mm, sharp external edges should also be rounded as the tip can easily become wavy and uneven. = Solid profiles if possible = Solid Profiles reduce the die costs and are often easier to produce. = Fewer cavities in hollow profile = Often a variety of hollow profiles are very difficult to produce hence a hollow profile should be replace by two telescoping profiles, to ease the manufacturing of the product. In many cases reducing the number of cavities in a hollow profile makes it easier to extrude, this also increases die stability. = Profiles with deep channels = For profiles with pockets or channels, there is a basic rule that the width to height ratio should be approximately 1:3. This ensures that the strength of the die is not jeopardised. By using a large radii at the opening of the channel, and a full radius at the bottom the ratio can be increased to 1:4 = Heat sinks = Use of cooling fins on profiles greatly increases the heat dissipation area. This can be further increased by giving the fins a wavy surface. Where there is forced air-cooling longitudinally along the profile, it is better to leave the fins smooth. This helps to avoid the problem of eddy formation. An undulating surface increases the heat dissipation area of fins.http://www.aluminiumdesign.net/design-support/extrusion-design-guide/  Surface Finish  During an extrusion process it is essential to take care of the surface finish of the exposed surfaces of the product. As a general rule, the narrower the exposed surface, the more uniform its finish. Webs, flanges and abrupt changes in metal thickness may show up as marks on the opposite surface of an extrusion, particularly on thin sections. The marking of exposed surfaces can be minimized by some design changes such as rounding the transitions to reduce the chance of opposite-side streaking.http://www.alexandriaindustries.com/technicalguides/designing.pdf  Symmetry  Symmetry provides for more balance forces and helps avoiding over stressing areas of the extruding die. Hollow areas within the cross section, in particular, should be balanced. http://thelibraryofmanufacturing.com/extrusion_design.html  Length tolerances  Some tolerances are designed in to the required length of extrusion. It can be difficult and expensive to cut a perfect length during production as metals or thermoplastics expand and contract at different temperatures. Greater accuracy is possible if lengths are cut off-line. A typical length tolerance for UPVC would be +/- 1mm on a 500mm length.https://www.tpextrusions.com/beginners-guide-rigid-extrusion- design.html  Extrusion ratio  It is the ratio of the cross sectional areas of the shape of the die opening to that of the container through which the billet is pushed. A large-diameter billet pushed through a very small die opening has a high reduction ratio. It may not be possible to extrude such a part. Ratios of 75:1 are common, though difficult. The solution, however, for a difficult ratio shape is to make the part on a press with a smaller container. Another option is to use a multihole die that lets a number of profiles extrude simultaneously. They also come in handy for small shapes that are too ling to handle practically with even the shortest billets the press can extrude.http://machinedesign.com/archive/smart-ways-design-aluminum- extrusions References Category:Forming processes ","title":"Rule based analysis of extrusion process"},{"id":"47772571","text":"Tamar Schlick is an American applied mathematician who works as a professor of chemistry, mathematics, and computer science at New York University.

Early life  Yeager was born and grew up in a small farm town south of Cleveland, Ohio. As a child in the 1960s, he enjoyed watching horror and science fiction on television. His parents had too little resources for regular trips to the movie theater, but the family did enjoy an occasional night at the drive-in theater. In his early teens, Yeager saw the movie Boys in the Band. He found a copy of the play, and after reading it, decided he would like to be an actor. By the time he was sixteen, he was watching movies critically and reading books to better understand the medium.  Career  In 1980, the Yeager family moved to Las Vegas. There, Yeager joined The Community Drama Workshop and was cast as an extra in one of the growing number of productions filming in that city. While working on the movie, he met the horror genre actor, Robert Quarry, known for Count Yorga, Vampire, and they became friends. In 1985, Yeager moved to Los Angeles. He managed a cabinet shop in North Hollywood for several years. The economy failed and Yeager was faced with dismissing five employees.

The business manager and silent partner was Don Raverty. The line-up, at times, was an eighteen-piece ensemble, that played popular jazz cover versions and originals. Lead singers that fronted the band include Kerrie Biddell, Marcia Hines and Ricky May. They released seven albums and toured Australia and internationally before disbanding in September 1983.  History  Daly-Wilson Big Band was formed in Sydney in 1968 by Warren Daly on drums and Ed Wilson on trombone. Don Raverty was asked to manage and coordinate the band and was a business partner from the beginning. Daly began his musical career in the late 1950s as a drummer in the Ramblers and then the Steeds. In the mid-1960s he toured the United States as a member of Kirby Stone Four, and then with Si Zentner; later he joined Glenn Miller Orchestra (led by Buddy DeFranco). Wilson had trained as a pianist before changing over to brass instruments. In 1966 he joined the ABC Dance Band conducted by Jim Gussey; he subsequently played with the Sydney Symphony and TCN-9 house band led by Geoff Harvey. In August 1969 Daly-Wilson Band performed at the Stage Club with a line-up of \\"top jazz and session musicians\\" including Kerrie Biddell on lead vocals; Tony Buchanan on saxophones, harmonica and clarinet; Graeme Lyall on saxophone; Bob McIvor on trombone; Col Nolan on organ, piano and electric piano; and Dieter Voigt on flugelhorn and trumpet. In September 1970 they recorded their debut album, Live! At the Cell Block, which detailed their live performance at Cell Block Theatre, Sydney. It was produced by Mike Perjanik and released on Columbia Records. Additional ensemble members on the album were Mark Bowden, George Brodbeck, John Costelloe, Ken Dean, Doug Foskett, Col Loughnan, Allan Nash, Ford Ray, Don Reid, Ned Sutherland, Bernie Wilson. The album includes a cover version of \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\\" as \\"Kanga\\", a track written by fellow Australian artist, Rolf Harris. In January 1971 the group supported the United Kingdom jazz band, Dudley Moore Trio, on the Australian leg of their international tour. Michael Foster of The Canberra Times described Daly-Wilson Big Band as \\"an exciting two-year-old group formed by Warren Daly and Ed Wilson, drummer and trombonist respectively. It has the unmatchable sound of musicians playing mainly for their own enjoyment and has won critical acclaim at all of its relatively few public appearances.\\" He praised their live performance, especially \\"When the band lets go, which is often, the sound is a blast, literally and metaphorically. And Kerrie Biiddell, the vocalist, pencil-thin, freckled and animated, raises a storm somewhere deep inside.\\" Foster also reviewed their album, \\"[its] arrangements are lively and all are spiced with this rushing excitement of shouting horns and driving rhythm section. Use of amplification helps the volume ... the very composition of the band preserves the brassy feel of big band jazz.\\" Live! At the Cell Block was released in the US in late 1971. They were \\"rapidly gathering a strong following\\" but by November, Daly-Wilson Big Band announced their disbandment. DeFranco asked both Daly and Wilson to join the Glenn Miller Orchestra; In 1972 Festival Records released The Exciting Daly-Wilson Band, which included lead vocals from Biddell. Soon after recording this album, they had run out of finances and could no longer afford to tour their big band line-up. Biddell resumed her solo career; she told Jean DeBelle of The Australian Women's Weekly that when she joined they were \\"just starting to happen. I got my biggest break when I started singing with them, as the band played to huge audiences.\\" In May 1973 Daly-Wilson Big Band reformed, with financial support from commercial patron, Benson & Hedges, and undertook another Australian tour, as well as New Zealand. Their vocalists were Linda Cable, Terry Holden, Dilys Lockett and Neva Phillips. They subsequently issued another album, On Tour, with Daly and Wilson joined by Ray Alldridge on keyboards; Warren Clark, Larry Elam, Norm Harris, Mick Kenny and Don Raverty on trumpets; Herb Cannon, Merv Knott, Bob McIvor and Peter Scott on trombones; Dave Donovan and Hugh Williams on guitars; Doug Foskett, Paul Long, John Mitchell, Geoff Naughton and Bob Pritchard on saxophones; and John Helman on bass guitar. It was co- produced by Daly-Wilson and Tommy Tycho for Reprise Records. From February 1974 the ensemble's lead singer was Marcia Hines – fresh from her stint as Mary Magdalene in the Australian stage production of Jesus Christ Superstar. In September 1975 they toured the Soviet Union at the request of Gosconcert as part of a cultural exchange. They played venues in Moscow, Vilnius, Kaunas, Riga and St Petersburg to packed houses and local critical acclaim. The Australian ABC Network sent producer Bernie Cannon to film the latter part of the Russian tour that was later viewed in Australia. They were scheduled to play at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London but this was thwarted by British Customs who refused to release their instruments. From there they flew to Las Vegas where they performed at the Las Vegas Hilton, sharing the stage with BB King and Wilson Picket. Then to Los Angeles for two nights, again to packed houses, at a local Jazz club. Their next album, Daly-Wilson Big Band featuring Marcia Hines (1975), had Hines' vocals on the cover songs, \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" and \\"Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?\\". Foster felt that Hines \\"brings that bubbling vivacity which is her stage mark to her appearances. I like her best on 'Orleans'. She seems to get right inside this particular airing. Perhaps it evoked some [memories] of her homeland which she visited... during the highly successful world tour made by the band.\\" During late 1974 Hines had also recorded her debut solo album, Marcia Shines (October 1975). She left the jazz ensemble to promote her album and focus on her solo career. In November 1976 US entertainer, Vic Damone, featured Daly-Wilson Big Band for a TV special aimed at the US market, Australia for the Fun of It, which also included Bill and Boyd, The Angels and David Gulpilil. Also that year they issued another album, In Australia '77, on the Hammard label. During January 1977 they toured Australia with New Zealand-born vocalist, Ricky May, fronting the group. In 1978 they issued their next album, Too Good for a One Night Stand, on Hammard. They released their seventh album, Big 'N' Brassy, in 1982. In September 1983 they disbanded. According to AllMusic's reviewer \\"Sponsorship had been withdrawn and finances were as strained as the leaders' acrimonious relationship.\\" During their career Daly-Wilson Big Band had \\"introduced jazz to a large commercial market, although some purists criticised its jazz rock approach, but there were many future jazz greats that passed through its ranks.\\" The Daly-Wilson Big Band was Australias most successful Jazz big band, introducing many people to the genre of Jazz, but big band in particular. It is still the benchmark for excitement and excellence in this genre and over the years gave birth to many notable careers.

A member of the Togashi family, he ruled Kaga Province as shugo. When the Ōnin War broke out, Masachika sided with the Hosokawa clan, while his brother Kochiyo sided with Yamana clan. With the aid of Asakura clan and the Ikkō-ikki, Masachika defeated his brother and was restored to power. However, the Ikkō-ikki fell into dispute with Masachika, rising up in two failed revolts in 1474 and 1475. In late 1487, when Masachika left on a campaign to aid the shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa, the Ikkō-ikki launched a massive revolt. Masachika returned to quell the rebellion, but was overwhelmed and cut off from any aid from the neighboring provinces. Besieged in his burning castle, he committed seppuku in 1488. Campaigns in the Ōnin War =Togashi civil war= In 1467, a civil war between Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Sōzen escalated into a nationwide conflict known as Ōnin War. Since 1445, Togashi Masachika had contended with resistance from the warriors of Kaga, and low-level rural violence was probably frequent in the province. With the outbreak of the Ōnin War, the unrest in Kaga escalated into a civil war among the Togashi clan between Masachika and his younger brother Kochiyo over the position of shugo. Masachika sided with Hosokawa and Kochiyo with Yamana. Masachika was driven out of Kaga by Kochiyo in 1473. Masachika requested aid from Asakura Toshikaga, the lord of Echizen and ally of Hosokawa, as well as from the priests of Yoshizaki, who followed Rennyo, the leader of the Hongan- ji school of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism. Masachika's brother Kochiyo patronized the Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival to the Hongan-ji for control of the Shinshū sect, and persecuted followers of the Hongan-ji. Masachika also promised the ikki that if restored to power, he would alleviate their poverty. Toshikaga pledged his support, as did the Yoshizaki priests, and so with Toshikaga providing military aid and the Ikkō-ikki rioting throughout Kaga, Masachika quickly overthrew his brother. Kaga Rebellion Ikki support for Masachika dissolved almost immediately. By 1474, the Ikkō-ikki argued that Masachika did not fulfill his promises of relieving their poverty, and they attempted a rebellion. Rennyo, however, refused to endorse this action. The rebels were quickly defeated, and many took refuge in Etchū Province. In 1475, Shimotsuma Rensu, a disciple of Rennyo, falsely claimed that Rennyo supported a renewed uprising in Kaga. The revolt was suppressed, and Rennyo excommunicated Rensu. Despite the failure of these revolts, unrest continued to simmer in Kaga. The remnant Ikkō-ikki in Kaga refused to pay taxes and even seized tax revenue and land, despite the protests of their alleged leader Rennyo. In 1487, Masachika responded to a request for military aid from shōgun Ashikaga Yoshihisa, who was attempting to suppress the robber baron Rokkaku Tokoyori in Ōmi Province. In the absence of Masachika and his army, Rengo, Renkō, and Rensei, three sons of Rennyo, instigated a revolt. Between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand members rebelled against Masachika. Masachika quickly returned from his military expedition, and at first was successful at defeating the ikki armies. However, several vassal families, including the Motoori and Yamagawa, then joined with the rebels. The rebels cut off Masachika from potential reinforcement by his allies in Echizen, Etchū, and Noto Provinces, and then trapped Masachika in his castle. Besieged in a burning castle and faced with certain defeat, Masachika committed seppuku. In his place, the vassal families who rebelled against Masachika put forward his uncle and ex-shugo, Yasutaka, as a candidate to be the new shugo. Rather than administer a government directly, the ikki preferred to delegate someone else as a minimal ruler. Historian David L. Davis theorizes that the rebellion against Masachika was because \\"he was attempting to end the general anarchy of Kaga and force the province to submit to a measure of discipline.\\"  References  = Citations = = Works cited =    Category:Daimyo Category:1488 deaths Category:Samurai Category:People of Muromachi-period Japan Category:1460s in Japan Category:1470s in Japan Category:1480s in Japan Category:15th-century Japanese people Category:Seppuku Category:Suicides by sharp instrument in Japan ","title":"Togashi Masachika"},{"id":"47772745","text":"Katsukarē is a Japanese dish consisting of a pork cutlet (tonkatsu) served with a portion of Japanese rice and curry. It is served on a large plate and is typically eaten using a spoon or fork. The cutlet is usually precut into strips, eliminating the need for a knife. Generally eaten as a main course, the dish can be accompanied with water or miso soup. In Japan, there are fast- food restaurant chains which specialize in serving katsukarē, with varying meats and types of curry.  History  The dish is claimed to have originated at , a yōshoku restaurant in Ginza, Tokyo, in 1948.

Fascell Bridge, is a bridge in the Florida Keys connecting Long Key and Conch Key, roughly halfway between Miami and Key West. At a length of nearly two and a half miles, it is the second longest bridge on the Overseas Highway after the Seven Mile Bridge. The current bridge opened in 1982, replacing the parallel Long Key Viaduct, which carried the Overseas Railroad from 1907 to 1935 and was repurposed for highway use shortly after. Current Structure Long Key Bridge is officially named for former U.S. Representative Dante B. Fascell Opening in 1982, the current bridge was built as part of a modernization effort for the entire Overseas Highway to replace the aging historic bridges originally built for the Overseas Railroad. The current bridge is a box-girder structure built from precast, prestressed concrete sections. The bridge consists of 103 spans total, two of which are 117 feet long with the remaining spans at a length of 118 feet. The spans are supported by a series of \\"V\\"-shaped piers. This method allowed the superstructure to be pieced together in less than 12 months. Bridges built in the keys at this time were some of the first in North America to be built using this method. The current bridge is officially named after U.S. Representative Dante Fascell, who served from 1955 to 1993. He is best known for championing legislation to create Biscayne National Park. Long Key Viaduct Postcard of a train crossing Long Key Viaduct The current structure was built to replace the Long Key Viaduct, which still stands parallel to the bridge. The Long Key Viaduct was completed in 1907 by Henry Flagler as part of his Overseas Railroad, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway (though the railroad would not fully reach Key West until 1912). The viaduct was built with a series of 186 concrete arches, a design used by most of the railroad bridges in the keys. The Florida East Coast Railway often used the Long Key Viaduct in promotional material for the Overseas Railroad. Long Key Viaduct under construction Rail service was discontinued after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 struck the area, which irreparably destroyed the railroad in the upper keys. The viaduct itself though was not heavily damaged. The Florida East Coast Railway then sold the remaining right of way and infrastructure to the state, who then built the Overseas Highway along the route. To accommodate the highway, the tracks on the bridge were replaced by a new two-lane wide reinforced concrete surface for automobile traffic. Long Key Viaduct as of 2015 The Long Key Viaduct was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 13, 1979, along with the original Seven Mile Bridge and the Bahia Honda Rail Bridge. The viaduct was replaced by the current highway bridge shortly after in 1982. After discontinuation of automobile traffic, the viaduct was repurposed again as a bike path and fishing pier. For the most part, the deck of the viaduct was reduced to its original width from the railroad era. There are several fishing platform on both sides of the bridge. The viaduct is now part of the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail, a multi-use bicycle and pedestrian path that will eventually run the entire length of the Overseas Highway.

It is found in the drier parts of the continent, including to the west of the Great Dividing Range in the eastern states. Description Eremophila glabra subsp. glabra is a shrub varying in size but in the range high, sometimes spreading to wide. The stems are covered with fine white hairs, except for a strip underneath the leaf attachment, so that the hairs are in bands down the stems interspersed with glabrous bands. The leaves are scattered and spreading, elliptic to lance shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide. The flowers are red or orange, sometimes yellow and occur singly in the leaf axils on flower stalks long. There are 5 partly overlapping sepals which are narrow triangular to egg shaped and 5 petals forming a tube except at the ends where the lowest lobe is thinner that the rest and is turned back below the flower. Flowering occurs from January to November and is followed by fruits which are oval to almost spherical and in diameter.Kalgoorlie Taxonomy and naming Eremophila glabra subsp. glabra is an autonym and therefore the taxonomy is the same as for Eremophila glabra.

Running from a junction with the South Florida Rail Corridor in Hialeah near Miami International Airport south to Homestead, the line is the southernmost trackage in CSX's system. The line begins just east of Miami International Airport where it branches off the state-owned South Florida Rail Corridor (CSX's former Miami Subdivision). The line heads southwest around the airport's Runway 9/27 to Oleander Junction, where the Lehigh Spur to Doral and Sweetwater branches off to the west. The Florida East Coast Railway's Little River Branch also connects to the Homestead Subdivision at Oleander Junction.CSX Jacksonville Division Timetable From Oleander Junction, the line heads south and southwest into southern Miami-Dade County, passing through Little Havana and Kendall (where it parallels the Don Shula Expressway). The line ends just south of a wye and the abandoned Homestead Seaboard Air Line Railway Station. The line's milepost numbers continue from the South Florida Rail Corridor, though the numbers are subtracted from 1000 for simplicity. The southern half of the line only sees sporadic freight service. There have been proposals in the past to extend Tri-Rail commuter service down the line to Homestead but the idea has never made it past the proposal stage. As of March 2019, the southernmost 12 miles of the line are classified as out of service. History The Homestead Subdivision was originally built in 1927 as the southern extension of the Seaboard-All Florida Railway, a subsidiary of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. It was built parallel the now-abandoned southern segment of the Florida East Coast Railway that led up to the Overseas Railroad to Key West. At the north end, some of the original track was realigned in 1951 to accommodate the expansion of Miami International Airport.

It was originally released on September 9, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. The game is set on recursive, concentric circles that alternate in color, on which a variety of enemies pose the player with numerous challenges. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot Circa Infinity contains 50 levels, which are divided into 5 parts. Each part adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay. The player controls their character (or characters) by running around the edge of a circle. The core flow of the game involves flipping inside the circle at specified areas, avoiding demons, and jumping to the next circle. Since the enemies from the previous few circles stay on screen, the level design additionally serves to create a hypnotizing visual effect. Soundtrack The Circa Infinity Official Soundtrack was written and produced by brothers Jack Fay and Jim Fay under the name JACK+JIM. Reception Circa Infinity received generally positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the game 78.00% based on 5 reviews and 80/100 based on 6 reviews. Destructoid's Ben Pack scored the game 9 out of 10, saying \\"Brilliant level design and a great aesthetic keep the game fresh from start to finish\\". Pack praised the game's progression, saying that the levels \\"all do a great job of slowly introducing new mechanics and folding them back into existing challenges\\". Nathan Grayson of Kotaku called Circa Infinity \\"a game where each moment is unified yet singular\\", saying \\"the whole game has an almost musical cadence to it, a churning swirl of interlocking audio and visuals that lulls you into a purely reflexive state before jolting you awake with a section that requires serious forethought\\" References Category:2015 video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:GameClub games ","title":"Circa Infinity"},{"id":"47772984","text":"Thaleia Zariphopoulou (born 1962) is a Greek-American mathematician specializing in mathematical finance.

He is an elusive character, who left several notable paintings of market scenes, but little is known about the artist himself. His work is believed to have influenced a later generation of German painters.  Work  Little is known about Arnout apart from the two market scenes he painted, namely Woman selling fruit and vegetables and Vegetable and Flower Market, formerly in the collections of the Farnese family of Parma and now kept at the Museum of Capodimonte in Naples. Licia Ragghianti Collobi notes the influences of Joachim Beuckelaer for still lifes, Hans Vredeman de Vries for architectural decoration and Maerten de Vos for figures in these two market scenes, which suggest he was trained in Antwerp around 1560-1570. Another work, A Fish Seller's Stall has also been attributed to de Muyser. Elizabeth Honig has compared de Muyser's work with later paintings executed in Frankfurt and has concluded that de Muyser played a role in bringing paintings of market scenes to Germany. The structure, design and the painting's themes suggest that there was some link between Antwerp and Frankfurt.

The reason for his non- appearance is unknown but it has been speculated that he was advised not to go by a surgeon, that \\"he had betaken himself that same evening to Brussels or elsewhere.\\" or through \\"the negligence of a servant, who from oversleeping himself was unable to call his master sufficiently early to be in readiness to discharge the proper duties of his military rank.\\" Although he joined the 18th Hussars towards the end of the battle and took part in Major General Sir Hussey Vivian's decisive charge, he resigned from the army shortly afterwards.

Most trains ran beyond Rainford Junction through to St Helens. The station was situated on Castle Lane, Westhead, near Ormskirk. It opened on 1 July 1906 and closed on 18 June 1951. The line through the station was lifted in the 1960s and the station has been demolished, though the trackbed can easily be found. Services In July 1922 16 \\"Up\\" (southbound) trains called at the station on weekdays, with an extra on Saturday evenings. All originated at Ormskirk, several with connections from Southport. Ten Up trains called on Sundays. All trains continued to where a few terminated, the majority continuing all stations to St Helens. The \\"Down\\" (northbound) service was similar. The trains all consisted of \\"Motor Cars – One class only\\". Please note that 'Motor Cars' then did not have their modern meaning, but consisted of a single railway coach joined to a dedicated steam locomotive. Their generic type is summarised in L&YR; railmotors. Photographs appear in Bob Pixton's work on the line. In 1951 the Up service consisted of nine trains on weekdays with four extra on Saturdays, one of which terminated at Skelmersdale. The rolling stock was \\"Third Class Only\\". Of the nine trains five continued past Rainford Junction, all stations to St Helens. Eight trains called on Sundays, plying between Ormskirk and Rainford Junction only. The Down service was similar. As was often the case with such local services, these trains acquired a nickname – \\"The Skem Dodger\\". All local trains plying between Ormskirk and St Helens called at Rainford Junction, entailing a reverse. None used the 'direct line' between Bushey Lane Junction and Randle Junction which formed the third side of the triangle shown on the route diagram.

Career He served in the Sussex Militia, becoming a major in 1783 and lieutenant-colonel in 1803. In 1790 and 1791 he was elected MP for Steyning, but was forced on both occasions to stand down on petition.

History Between 1900 and 1907, attempts were made to organise clerks in different parts of Australia. In Victoria the Union of Clerks was founded in 1901, and in South Australian an Associate of Clerks and in New South Wales a Clerks' Union were formed in 1905.http://www.together.org.au/about/our-history/ The FCU was formed in Melbourne in 1911, and was registered with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court the same year. It grew to include branches in all states by 1920, consolidating several pre-existing state unions, and held its first federal conference in 1916. It changed its name to the Australian Clerical Association in 1917, but reverted to its former name in 1924. Political position The union drastically shifted ideological direction throughout its history. In the 1940s, it had a significant communist influence, with high-profile figures like Jack Hughes holding key union offices. In the early 1950s, the union was successfully targeted and taken over by the conservative Industrial Groups, which subsequently played a role in the Australian Labor Party split of 1955, and the union was one of four unions disaffiliated from the Australian Labor Party. It was a key right-wing union for decades afterwards. The union was taken over by moderate left-wing members in the 1980s in a push associated with Lindsay Tanner. The FCU was the first of four unions disaffiliated after the split of 1955 to attempt to return at the ALP Victorian State Conference in 1983. The Federated Clerks' case, 'after a bitter and at times acrimonious 3 and a 1/2 hour debate', which was 'centered on alleged links' with Santamaria, the National Civic Council, and the Industrial Action Fund, was defeated at the State Conference by 289 votes to 189. It was noted in a news report of the time that all four unions were likely to appeal to the federal ALP executive and that they had the support of then Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The ALP federal executive supported the re-affiliation before the 1985 Victorian State Conference while two of the unions, including the FCU, were refused re-affiliation in the Northern Territory later that year. Ultimately, all four unions reaffiliated with ALP in some form, the FCU through amalgamation with the Australian Services Union in 1993. Amalgamation In 1993, the FCU joined the Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union (MEU) and the Australian Municipal, Transport, Energy, Water, Ports, Community & Information Services Union (which was also known as the Australian Services Union at the time) into a new union also called the Australian Services Union. The new union kept the affiliation with the ALP of its predecessor.

It is based on the same technology as the U-verse service deployed by AT&T.; History Around the time that Sprint Nextel spun off their landline division to form Embarq, Verizon and AT&T; began work on their own IPTV services to compete with the local cable companies. Embarq was no different, and had started work on a similar service called Embarq TV. Details were scarce, but the service was rumored to have been an IPTV fiber-to-the-node service similar to AT&T;'s U-verse. The service was going through beta testing when CenturyTel agreed to purchase Embarq to form CenturyLink in 2009. CenturyLink (still known as CenturyTel) began rolling out what was to eventually be known as Prism TV in October 2009 in Jefferson City, Missouri. It adopted the Prism TV name in 2011, based on the Embarq TV infrastructure. Over time, CenturyLink began rolling out Prism TV in markets as they were upgraded from the old copper- based services to fiber-optic communication, eventually offering the service in markets in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. Other markets were to follow once their lines were upgraded to be able to carry Prism TV. In the interim, markets that did not offer Prism TV had a triple play option through CenturyLink with DirecTV. Some CenturyLink customers also had Dish Network as their TV provider through CenturyLink under a grandfather clause, as Dish was the legacy provider through CenturyTel and Embarq; CenturyLink switched to DirecTV as part of its acquisition of Qwest, who had partnered with DirecTV. As of January 2020, Prism TV is not being offered to new customers in all markets. Instead, CenturyLink is providing DirecTV for new customers. Reception Reception for Prism TV has been generally positive, with many observers feeling that giving consumers the option in areas where they might have been stuck with the local cable company if they weren't able to receive satellite television (due to either technical reasons or not being allowed through their landlords if they rent their homes) combined with cord-cutting would ultimately help push pay TV prices lower. While CenturyLink has been slower to roll out Prism TV compared to Verizon Fios and AT&T; U-verse, it has gotten praise from some consumer advocate groups that they are at least putting forth the effort to upgrade their landlines and offer the service. Verizon and to a lesser extent AT&T; have both received criticism for all but abandoning their landline infrastructure to focus more on their wireless divisions, something CenturyLink doesn't offer on its own. (CenturyLink does offer bundling services for Verizon Wireless.) Verizon has in fact faced lawsuits from the city governments in New York City and Pittsburgh (both of which offer CenturyLink in parts of their suburban areas, though neither currently offer Prism TV) for failure to deploy Fios throughout their respective cities. While AT&T; has mostly deployed U-verse throughout its 21-state landline territory and has maintained its landlines, they have shown a lack of commitment on U-verse and plan on merging U-verse into DirecTV, which AT&T; acquired in 2015.

Like its parent macrohaplogroup GHIJK, Haplogroup HIJK and its subclades comprise the vast majority of the world's male population. HIJK branches subsequently into two direct descendants: IJK (L15/M523/PF3492/S137) and H (L901/M2939). IJK in turn splits into IJ (F-L15) and K (M9). The descendants of Haplogroup IJ are haplogroups I and J, while Haplogroup K is, ultimately, the ancestor of major haplogroups M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, L, and T.

Populations with high proportions of males who belong to descendant major haplogroups of Haplogroup HIJK live across widely dispersed areas and populations.

She is known for her public speaking on behalf of socialism and Owenism. Life Emma Bullock was born in Bristol and after the death of her father she moved to Clifton with her mother and stepfather. At seventeen she joined the radical Particular Baptists. She later married Isaac Luther Martin and together they had three daughters. He was, however, 'a husband … whose company it was a humiliation to endure' (Holyoake, 4), and in the years after their marriage, despite all her religious and educational activities, Emma Martin became miserable and restless. She heard Alexander Campbell (1796-1870) in 1839 and he caused her to support the socialist Owenite points of view.Emma Martin, Oxford Journals, Retrieved 10 September 2015 At the time Campbell was known as Robert Owen's \\"principal Scottish disciple\\". However, Martin rejected the socialist view that religion was not important. Martin challenged this idea and used her own beliefs to challenge the secular approach. However, it was Martin who was eventually persuaded. =Owenite= Martin left her husband and rejected his faith, instead taking up the Owenite cause. In 1840 she was in discussions with James Pierrepont Greaves who was trying to make Owenism less secular. By 1841 she was addressing the Owenite annual conference where her views on women's rights were received. She spoke of the freedom that Socialism might bring women by giving them financial independence. Martin was touring the country and speaking publicly to thousands. She had to leave her daughters with friends and this must have put a strain on her financially. Martin was stoned by opponents and she could find crowds that were either attracted or there to object to her atheism. There was a realistic likelihood that she could be imprisoned for blasphemy and she formed an organisation with George Jacob Holyoake to mitigate this risk. However, she was taken to court, but unlike Holyoake, she was never convicted. =Midwife= In 1845 she withdrew from public speaking and became a midwife.Janes, Dominic (2011) Emma Martin and the manhandled womb in early Victorian England.

She became the first woman elected to the South Carolina Legislature with her election to the South Carolina State Senate in 1928. Life Mary Gordon was born to Alexander M. Gordon and Mary Gamble Gordon, Sr. in the small community of Gourdin, near Kingstree; of Scotch-Irish descent, she was one of ten children. When she was small, the family moved into Kingstree, where she grew up, graduating from Kingstree High School in 1909. Already as a child she evinced an interest in politics, hanging around the steps of the county courthouse while listening to legal discussions, and sometimes sneaking inside to watch the court proceedings. Upon graduating from high school Ellis taught locally for one year before heading to Winthrop College in Rock Hill for further study. There she graduated in 1913 after working part-time to pay for her education, which was also funded with scholarship money; she had taken a sabbatical due to poor health in 1912, during which she had continued to teach. She then moved south to Jasper County, near the border with Georgia, to serve as teacher and principal at a school in the town of Gillisonville; she was the only female college graduate in the county, and the first teacher there with a college degree. In 1914 Ellis married Junius Gather Ellis, a farmer and turpentine operator who was relatively affluent for the area; with him she would have three children, Mary Elizabeth, Margaret Lee, and Junius Gather. The family lived at Ellis's home, Stockholm, located between Gillisonville and Coosawhatchie. She continued to teach, unusual for a married woman at the time; she and her husband hired a tutor to help educate their children so that she could work. She also assisted in running her husband's businesses. So alarmed were the couple at the poor state of local schools that when their eldest child was ready to begin her formal education, they sent her to live with relatives in Savannah to take advantage of the better schools there; her siblings soon followed. Ellis further invited her sisters, students at Winthrop, to come and live with her during the summer and tutor local students to improve their education. One of their pupils went on to run the theological program at Duke University, while another took a high position at Clemson University. To combat educational deficiencies in Jasper County, Ellis determined in 1924 to run for the position of county superintendent of schools. Many thought she was joking. Women were still rarities in elected office in South Carolina, and it was only two years since Kate Vixon Wofford had taken office as the first woman elected to public office in the state, when she became county superintendent of schools in Laurens County. Some of her acquaintance asked Ellis why she would want to head the county's education programs when her own children were being educated elsewhere; she replied, speaking of local schools, \\"If they are not good enough for my children, they are not good enough for yours.\\" =Political career= Ellis immediately set about reforming education in Jasper County. One of her first acts was to close many small schools and consolidate students under five districts; she then created a governing board with representatives from each of them. She pushed for the construction of a teacherage, and required her educators to get more training, sometimes meeting on Saturdays and inviting state education officials to send her instructors. She combated nepotism on the county board of education, firing some trustees. She also worked to improve conditions for African-American students, providing them with new textbooks and bus transportation and hiring a black college graduate, Mary Alice Miller, to oversee black schools in the county. She also received matching funds which she used to build four Rosenwald schools. This upset many local whites; one of them, the local state representative, H. Klugh Purdy, wrote Ellis a letter in which he said that she should resign over her behavior. After consultation with the young lawyer's father-in-law, she said that she would not resign, telling him, \\"You must take me for an idiot.\\" His response was to cause the office of superintendent to become an appointed office rather than an elected one, and soon thereafter local legislators sent Ellis a letter informing her of her termination. The position would not become an elected one again until 1958; the law making the change was sponsored by Ellis's brother-in-law, state senator W. J. Ellis. When in 1928 Purdy filed to run for the South Carolina Senate Ellis followed suit, winning in a runoff later that year. As a legislator her economic record was somewhat liberal for the time, but she was quite socially conservative; she opposed divorce and favored \\"stricter marriage laws\\". She also supported the legalization of gambling on horse races. She believed in the expansion of women's roles in public life, and favored fair treatment for blacks as well. She believed in, and worked for, compulsory education for all South Carolina students. Most of the bills which she introduced were on matters relating to her home county, as was the one speech which she gave from the floor during her time in office. She was known for her independent spirit, refusing to align herself with any factions in the legislature, and she strove to get along with her colleagues, though she was not above criticizing them at times. Her background saw her named to the Education Committee; during her term she also served on the committees regarding Privileges and Elections, Retrenchments, Incorporations, and Penitentiary, Penal, and Charitable Institutions. Ellis was defeated for reelection in 1932; the uterine cancer from which she had suffered since her time as school superintendent made campaigning for her second term extremely difficult. She died fifteen months later at the age of 44, having returned to the family home in Kingstree to be looked after by her sisters, nurses who had remained there to look after their father in his declining years. She is buried in the Williamsburg Cemetery in Kingstree. She kept her interest in state and local politics until the end of her life; one of her last acts was to vote, which she did by absentee ballot the day before her death. She also remained interested in educational issues; though she could not attend her eldest daughter's high school graduation, she attempted to remain involved. Both of her daughters would visit her on weekends and discuss schoolwork with her, and the elder of the two began college at Winthrop not long before her mother's death. No more women would be nominated or appointed to the South Carolina Senate until Elizabeth Johnston Patterson in 1979. Purdy was defeated in 1936 by a brother-in-law of Ellis. Honors Recognition of Ellis was slow in coming; for many years residents of Jasper County did not view her as one of their own, and a county history published in the 1940s made no mention of her role in local affairs. Her son attempted to get a historical marker erected regarding her achievements in Ridgeland, the county seat, but this came to naught. When in 1992 the county solicited names for the new county administration building, Ellis's children proposed her as an honoree, but were rebuffed despite the support of the county school board and Ridgeland Town Council; one councilor claimed that she was not chosen as she was not a county native. The building was eventually named for her in 1999. Today it houses several county departments, and a copy of the state house portrait hangs in its entryway. A portrait of Ellis by Janet Fleming Smith hangs in the South Carolina State House to recognize her contributions to civic life; commissioned by her family, it was accepted by legislators for display after extensive lobbying, and was unveiled on March 29, 1995, the hundredth anniversary of the election of Martha Hughes Cannon as a Utah state senator. Ellis was posthumously awarded the South Carolina Democratic Women's Council Hall Of Fame Award as well. Winthrop University named her a distinguished alumna at its centennial celebrations in 1987. In 1993 she was one of the first three inductees into Jasper County's new hall of fame, and she was honored by the South Carolina Commission on Women at their \\"Women of Achievement\\" awards ceremonies in 1994 and 1995. An archival collection of material related to Ellis and her career can be found in the library of the University of South Carolina.

He attended George III, becoming physician in ordinary in 1760, taking the place in the new reign of Frank Nicholls; and was created a baronet of Marylebone in the County of Middlesex on 9 August 1764. He treated the king in his first illness (1765). In partnership with a Scottish physician, Andrew Turnbull, he obtained land grants in Florida, where they planned a new settlement, New Smyrna, using indentured labour from the Mediterranean and Negro slaves. In 1768 eight ships set off from Minorca with more than a thousand settlers on board, but on arrival they found conditions deplorable. Duncan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1771. Towards the end of his life he moved abroad, passing his practice to Sir John Eliot. He died at Naples, in September 1774.

Tríptico sobre las complejas relaciones entre carlismo y catalanismo a fines del siglo XIX, [in:] Historia y Politica 14 (2005), p. 66 Almost all authors dealing with his literary works underline that Marian was enormously affected by the wartime experience, though none of the sources consulted clarifies what the nature of that impact was in terms of his political outlook.

His bid to format local Carlist political profile principally along regionalist lines failed. It was possibly thwarted by provincial authorities, as Vayreda lambasted them for ignoring regionalist fundaments of the Traditionalist program; moreover, he complained about political course incompatible with the spirit of the movement, smelling of \\"liberalism and authoritarianism\\".Canal 2006, p. 214, Canal 2004, p. 43 In 1896 he formally left Circulo Tradicionalista. During last years of his life Vayreda's links with Carlism were lukewarm. When publishing his short literary pieces he preferred not to co-operate with Carlist periodicals. His political relations boiled down to occasional co-operation during electoral campaigns;Canal 2005, p. 61 actually, Olot remained the most Carlist electoral district in Catalonia.during Restoration the Carlists grabbed 30% of all seats available, see Electoral Carlism (Restoration) Above all, he contributed to the cause in his Carlism-flavored works, inducing some to call him \\"prohom de la causa\\".Canal 2005, pp. 61-62, Canal 2004, p. 44 In and around Catalanism Unio Catalanista stamp Vayreda explained his juvenile access to Carlism as motivated principally by its defense of traditional regional establishments and by its regionalist spirit, though scholars note that those ex-post declarations might have been burdened by backward extrapolation of his mature views and by his mitigating intentions.Canal 2005, p. 58 It seems indisputable, however, that following the war his Carlism was getting watered down. Remaining within Traditionalist and Catholic framework, Vayreda's outlook was increasingly focused on regional identity and in the 1880s it was self-identified as \\"traditionalist regionalism\\".Canal 2004, p. 44, Canal 2005, p. 60, Canal 2006, p. 212 Though by no means natural, inevitable or typical,an expert scholar claims Carlism can by no means be considered pre-Catalanism and there was no natural or obvious choice for those trapped between the two idearios, Canal 2005, p. 57; however, at another point the author same claims that confrontation between Carlism and Catalanism was \\"inevitable\\", Canal 2005, p. 67 Vayreda's shift from orthodox Carlist ideario to particular emphasis on only one of its components – regional identity – is considered representative for a group of Traditionalist militants from different parts of Spain.other comparable cases were those of a Cantabrian José María de Pereda, a Gallego Alfredo Brañas and a Basque Daniel Irujo, Canal 2005, pp. 62-6, Canal 2006, pp. 214-9 In the post-war years it was possibly influenced by \\"ideologia de la muntanya\\" of Torras i Bages,Requesens i Pique 1988, p. 84, also Francesc Roma i Casanovas, Del Paradís a la Nació: la muntanya a Catalunya, segles XV-XX, Valls 2004, , p. 236 but assumed particular dynamics in the late 1880s, during campaign against the new Civil Code. In Olot it brought together people of different leanings, jointly with Vayreda forming the local Centre Catalanista and issuing its periodical, El Olotense (later l’Oloti);Canal 2005, p. 60, Canal 2006, p. 212, Dasca Batalla 2004, pp. 234-5 Vayreda kept supporting the periodical throughout the 1890s.

Història del primer catalanisme, Barcelona, 2003, , Illas 2004, p. 95 It did not stretch to embrace any sense of ethnic or national community.though his work is classified as contributing – unintentionally or possibly even against Vayreda’s intentions - to the Catalan national cause, Illas 2004, pp. 95-96 This identity was expressed almost exclusively in cultural terms and nothing is known of his support for Catalan political ambitions, autonomy-centered or otherwise; he was also cautious to distance himself from Catalanism flavored by federal or republican ideas.Vayreda underlined that he was attached to the region because of tradition, while the federalists opted for the region as the best rational choice, Canal 2005, p. 60, Canal 2006, p. 212 His vision of Catalonia was that of a spiritual entity epitomized by muntanya,characteristically, he made no note about maritime Catalonia, possibly considered the heartland of mercantile and modernist spirit the vision coined by Balmes, rejuvenated by Torres i Bages and sang in poetry by Verdaguer.Requesens i Pique 1988, p. 84 Vayreda's death was painfully acknowledged by Unió Catalanista, Lliga de Catalunya, Lliga Regional and Foment Catalanista.El Montanyench 22.02.03, available ; no condolences from Carlist organizations were reported Catalan standard According to dedicated studies of Vayreda's political outlook he remained on intersection between Carlism and Catalanism;\\"A finales del siglo XIX se había formado un espacio intersectivo entre los movimientos carlistas y catalanistas que complicaba mucho las relaciones entre unos y otros. El caso de Marià Vayreda apuntaba ya, en buena parte, en este sentido. El catalanismo no se instaló al lado de las tradiciones políticas y las formaciones del arco político catalán pre- existentes, sino que las cortó transversalmente. […] Por esta razón, en el caso del carlismo no sorprendían denominaciones como tradicionalismo regionalista o carlismo catalanista\\", Jordi Canal, El carlismo. Dos siglos de contrarrevolución en España, Madrid 2004, , p. 222 some authors agree by maintaining that in mature years he settled for a possibilist compromise between the two.Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 233 Other scholars clam that he opted for \\"Catalunya clarament carlina\\",Roma i Casanovas 2004, p. 236 declare that his Catalanism was recycled Carlism,Illas 2004, p. 94 suggest that he left Carlism to join regionalism,Margarida Casacuberta, Marià Vayreda, del trabuc a la ploma, [in:] Serra d'Or 528 (2003), p. 49 identify him as conservative regionalist absorbed by CatalanismDasca Batalla 2004, p. 233 or simply as moderate Catalanist (unconscious Catalanist,Illas 2003) with no mention of Carlism at all.Miquel Angel Fumanal i Pagès, Presència de l'art medieval en la pintura de Marian Vayreda i Vila, [in:] Annals del Patronat d'Estudis Històrics d'Olot i Comarca 15 (2005), p. 94 Those unwilling to dwell whether his Catalanism was enveloped in Carlism or whether it was rather the latter embedded in regional self settled for his late auto-definition of \\"tradicionalista regionalista\\".Vayreda i Vila, Marian, [in:] espaisescrits service, available here Painter Paisaje de Olot Vayreda kept painting through all of his adult life, though some scholars claim that in the mid-1890s he was gradually turning towards literature, either due to lack of public recognitioncommencing literary career with some frustration, Marian Vayreda.

Biografia [in:] Accociació d’escriptors en llengua catalana service, some claim the 3 leading themes were costumbrisme, religion and history, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 239 Landscapes are deeply set in the hilly Alt Garrotxa ambience, presenting local rural countryside with meticulous and accurate description. Featuring sunlighted sorted fields and wooded mountains they avoid any sign of decay or derangement. Despite what is described as their realism,by his contemporaries and present day scholars alike. The former saw his paintings as \\"brillantes manifestaciones de la escuela realista\\", related to the school of Rusiñol, Casas and Galvey, La Ilustración 04.05.90, available here. The latter underline his \\"meticulous, precise description of the visual landscape and his knowledge of the tiniest details in the environment and characters\\" and \\"clear realism\\", Museu del Sants service they deliver impression of perfect natural order;not all critics agreed. Some were anxious to see how he managed to combined religious threads with disturbing naturalism, asking \\"En este punto asáltame una duda que no me atrevería á resolver de plano por mi mismo á Vayreda que, á más de muy artista es muy religioso, ¿no teme que, tratándose, al fin y al cabo de cosas sagradas cual es la conducción del Viático parezca su detalle tan natural sobrado naturalista?\\", La Dinastia 21.04.87, available here due to neat and clean landscape contemporaries compared them to Japanese drawings.La Dinastia 21.04.87 Some value his landscapes higher than those of his brother Joaquím,according to Francesc Fontbona, \\"More than the landscape that his brother painted, Marian Vayreda is interested in the content of the landscape. For this reason, in his paintings and writings he narrates life in La Garrotxa and narrates it with a clear realism\\", Museu del Sants service others deem them inferior.Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 233; some paintings were produced jointly by Marian and his brother Joaquím; the former painted figures and the latter painted landscapes, Jose Maria Mir Mas de Xexas, Mariano Vayreda Vila [in:] ¡Arriba España! 23.12.67, available here, Mariano Vayreda i Vila, [in:] ¡Arriba España! 04.11.67 In a number of paintings landscape is the setting for local rural scenes, always scrupulously implanted in local customs and never containing a tiny hint of discord.Viático (1887), Puesta de sol (1898), Musico ambulante (?), Cortejo (?), or Las bugaderas (Las lavanderas), the last one painted jointly with his brother, see visitmuseum service available here; possibly also a highly symbolic Quietud (or Repòs) counts here El combregar a muntanya (Viático) Religious and historical scenes are often presented in medieval architectural setting, usually also related to Alt Garrotxa;most architectural objects present on his paintings can be identified, though in some cases like Ball del Gambeto, a Ridaura it seems not possible. Vayreda sometimes re-composed earlier sketches according to his liking it is reproduced with competent attention to detail,architecture gave credibility to his religious and historical scenes like in Oració or provided composition framework like in Quietud or Repòs en el claustre del Monestir de Sous. They are \\"realistic\\" only up to a point, since in some cases Vayreda enhanced or re-composed them, Fumanal i Pagès 2005, pp. 98-99 though at times also with some creativity.when suiting his composition or other needs; loose and creative approach to architecture, making it difficult to name him a \\"realist\\", is demonstrated in Recared abjurant l’arrianisme (1889), El rei Sisenand en el Concili IV de Toledo, presidit per Sant Isidor (1899) Fumanal i Pagès 2005, p. 104-105 Historical paintings, tending to be academic in style, often reveal a sophisticated factual context;like the canvas for carmelitan convent in Olot, referring to the 1332 foundation of the order, or Cap d’Estopa, picturing events of 1082, Mir Mas de Xexas 1967 they tend to focus on medieval history of Spain,e.g. El mercader de catifes (1879), El claustre (1878), Recared abjurant l’arrianisme (1889), El rei Sisenand en el Concili IV de Toledo, presidit per Sant Isidor (1899), Cap d’Estopa however initially Vayreda painted works also related to the Third Carlist War.Lluitant a la Plaça (1876), Els darrers honors en el cementiri de Lladó Religious works,Santa Rosalia, Èxtasi de Santa Rosalia (both 1901) usually designed for private usehe painted pictures designed for family chapel in the new Olot Villa of Prat de Vall, following removal from the previous Villa del Ser residence, Fumanal i Pagès 2005, p. 97-8 or for local sanctuaries,e.g. pictures presenting life of San José de Calasanz and San Pompillo Pirrotti in Padres Escolapios in Olot, Jose Maria Mir Mas de Xexas 1967, and canvases intended for monastyr of Sant Esteve de Banyoles, Fumanal i Pagès 2005, p. 98 reveal references – at times bordering quotations – to Italian Quattrocento;they reveal homages to Masaccio, Masolino, Andrea del Castagno, Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesca and Andrea Mantegna, Fumanal i Pagès 2005, p. 98 contemporaries valued them for color and chiaroscuro refinement,La Hormiga de Oro, 01.10.1885, available here today they are appreciated for composition and context.Fumanal i Pagès 2005, p. 98 Vayreda is considered member of the Olot School.l’Escola d’Olot; the group consisted of himself, his brother Joaquim and Josep Berga i Boix; for detailed discussion see Serés 2006, pp. 42-45 Far more than esthetic group emphasizing architectural patrimony, studying folklore or celebrating beauty of rural nature, the Olot painters shared the same holistic visionthey developed a holistic concept, merging economic, religious, political, social, cultural threads, Serés 2006, p. 43-5 and messianic understanding of art, intended to regenerate the society.Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 239, Serés 2006, p. 44 Some scholars claim it stemmed directly from Carlism and was its continuation by means of brush and paint.Canal 2005, p. 59 Others see it as an attempt of conservative re- Catalanisation.Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 239 Most agree that its central theme, embodied in a number of symbolic representations,especially the forests and mountains, see Requesens i Pique 1988, pp. 77-101. Also the contemporaries noted it, discussed in case of Reposo as follows: \\"Al pastorcillo que ha buscado el descanso propio y el de sus ovejas entre las ruinas de un antiguo templo, Vayreda lo coloca como figura yacente de un derruido sarcófago: lo pasado y lo presente, el fué y el es, unidos en una solanota, como para darnos á comprender lo veloz del tiempo, como para hacernos ver que lo presente, si bien lo analizamos, no existe, pues apenas llega ya pasó\\" was traditionalist vision of the region, confronting threatening modernitysome say he tended to accept modernity given it does not get in the way of traditional values, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 235 by means of re-vindicating earth, religion and history.Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 239, Its intention was to recreate Catalonia as a Muntanya along the lines of Jaime Balmes, Canal 2005, p. 59, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 234 In terms of artistic heritage, Vayreda and l’Escola d’Olot are considered related to vigatanisme,Canal 2005, p. 59 the Barbizon school,in terms of attention to detail, focus on rural life and customs, but without Barbizon-typical emphasis on hardship and poverty, Serés 2006, p. 44 the Nazarenes,in terms of orthodox focus on religious themes; the Nazarane threads passed by Claudi Lorenzale i Sugrañes, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 235 the Pre- Raphaelitesin terms of attention to detail, nature, and art as a refuge, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 239 and other minor groups.like Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc and Manuel Milà i Fontanals group, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 236 Writer (Sant Aniol) Though his 1888 literary debut was in Spanish,Una velada ... cursi, in El Montsacopa, published under the pen-name Francisco, Antónia Tayadella, L’atzavara no floreix fins que velleja. Approximació a la trajectoria literária de Mariá Vayreda, [in:] Estudis de llengua i literatura catalanes vol. 6, Barcelona 1993, , p. 154 since 1890 Vayreda was publishing short stories in Catalan,the first story published was L’avia Tita in L’Oloti in 1890, though the first one written was El roure de penjats, published in La Veu de Catalunya in 1891, Tayadella 1993, pp. 153-5 printed – also under pen- nameslike Tarik, M.V. or A.B.C, Antònia Tayadella, Sobre literatura del segle XIX, Barcelona 2013, , p. 279 – in regional periodicals.the first one to be mentioned is L’Oloti, until 1890 appearing as El Olotense (note the change of language from Spanish to Catalan), the review he co-founded in 1887 and published by Centre Catalanista d’Olot, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 235. Until 1895 Vayreda was publishing only in local Olot or Girona periodicals, starting that year he was first published in a Barcelona review. He published in La Renaixença, La Veu de Catalunya, Catalunya Artística, Joventut, Revista Olotense, L’Oloti, Sanch Nova, Luz, La Ilustració Llevantina, Catalunya Artistica, La Ilustració Catalana, Cu-Cut!, see Tayadella 2013, p. 290-4 Often set in the recent war, they were gaining popularity among readers; encouraged, in 1895 Vayreda started to participate in local literary competitions and turned out to be fairly successful.Tayadella 2013, pp. 280-282, Tayadella 1993, pp. 156-159 He wrote also few unedited poems.David Prats, Dues poesies inèdites de Marià Vayreda, [in:] Revista de Girona 183 (1997), pp. 32-34 In 1898 he published his first major work, Recorts de la darrera carlinada, a set of 14 carefully arranged stories from the Third Carlist War.probably partially based either on his own experience or on accounts of his fellow Carlist combatants, Illas 2004, p. 90; it seems that only few are entirely autobiographical and some are rather styled as fables, Antònia Tayadella, La novella realista, [in:] Joaquim Molas, Martin Riquer, (eds.), Història de la Literatura Catalana vol. 7, Barcelona 1986, ISBN p. 532 Lively narrated in 1st personthough they were not styled as personal memoirs of the author; story- telling is framed within a literary narrative model. Despite this, usually critics have no reservations about attributing opinions expressed by narrator to Vayreda himself, compare Canal 2005, p. 58 with declared intention to provide \\"veritat essencial\\", they differ in spiritthey range from descriptive (Bateig de foc) to grotesque (La xocolatera) to dramatic (Desesperació), with different protagonist characters dominating, like a disguised girl (El valencianet) or soldier who joked when dying (El Noi del’Alou). The two stories considered best are La barreja and L’Esquadró de la Sang, Vicanç Pagés Jordá, \\"Records de la darrera carlinada\\" - Marià Vayreda, [in:] vicencpagesjorda service and are heterogeneous in style,Antònia Tayadella, La novel•la realista, [in:] Història de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 7, Barcelona 1986, p. 532 but assembled together acknowledged crude brutality of the war.Illas 2004, p. 90 Though the book occasionally contained some nostalgic Carlist tone, it refrained from political proselytism; few scholars even see a dose of cynicism.Vicanç Pagés Jordá, \\"Records de la darrera carlinada\\" - Marià Vayreda, [in:] vicencpagesjorda service; the author draws parallels with dandyism of some Oscar Wilde’s protagonists and with western movies featuring Clint Eastwood Some present-day critics compare Recorts to war stories of Hemingway and Babel;Vicanç Pagés Jordá, \\"Records de la darrera carlinada\\" - Marià Vayreda, [in:] vicencpagesjorda service others consider Vayreda's stories his best work and declare him master of short prose.according to some, Vayreda is master of sentences rather than chapters, Vicanç Pagés Jordá, \\"Records de la darrera carlinada\\" - Marià Vayreda, [in:] vicencpagesjorda service Sanch nova (1900)sub-titled Novela muntanyenca is a contemporary novel set in Alt Garrotxa ambiencethe story takes place around Sant Aniol and focusing on confrontation between modern liberal spirit and traditionalist virtues,to purify blood contaminated by industry and liberalism Illas 2004, p. 90 embodied in a protagonist, a Catalan priest.Ramón de Montbrió, crossing Catalan mountains and delivering sermons resembles Jaime Balmes, Illas 2004, p. 91 Contemporaries hailed Sanch as \\"novella nacional\\" of Cataloniaopinion of Moliné i Brasés or \\"verdader simbol de Catalunya renaixent\\",Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 235, Tayadella 2013, p. 288 declaring the author \\"primer novellista del renaixement\\".opinion of Busquets i Punset Currently it is viewed as overburdened with didactics and ideology,Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 234, Tayadella 2013, p. 288 declared anachronistic pamphletIllas 2004, p. 90 and utopian idealization of inner Catalonia, represented by mountainous lifestyle pitted against degradation of new society.Illas 2004, p. 90, Canal 2005, p. 62. Anti- urban trend was by no means atypical for Carlist culture, compare Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, “Esa ciudad maldita, cuna del centralismo, la burocracia y el liberalismo”: la ciudad como enemigo en el tradicionalismo español, [in:] Actas del congreso internacional \\"Arquitectura, ciudad e ideología antiurbana\\", Pamplona 2002, , pp. 71-86 The \\"new blood\\" in title is nothing but established rural outlook; the book is labeled compendium of traditionalist regionalismIllas 2004, p. 90 or even Vayreda's political testament.Canal 2005, p. 62 La punyalada La Punyaladaalso subtitled Novela muntanyenca was published posthumously in 1904; though probably missing final touch of the author,some critics point to inconsistencies in narration, Maurici Serrahima, Maria Teresa Boada, La novella històrica en la literatura catalana, Montserrat 1996, , p. 135 it is widely considered his best work which gained Vayreda prominent place in history of the Catalan literature;though some consider it overrated, Vicanç Pagés Jordá, \\"Records de la darrera carlinada\\" - Marià Vayreda, [in:] vicencpagesjorda service the novel itself is acclaimed as one of the best works ever written in Catalan.\\"en un dels lloca més alts, si no el més alt, de la novella catalana\\" Serrahima, Boada 1996, p. 140 Set in the early 1840s it tells a rural love story against the background of Alt Garrotxa life troubled by local bandits, the trabucaires.possibly based on family experience, accounted by author’s father, Serrahima, Boada 1996, p. 129 It was originally classified as \\"novela ferrena\\",after Els sots feréstecs of Casellas; also Solitud of Victor Catala is counted here; other scholars underline key differences between Vayreda and Casellas and Victor Catala: the latter dazzle the reader with brutality, while in case of Vayreda it is merely a byproduct of narrative composition; the latter focus on literary effects while Vayreda is purely narrative; most importantly, the latter pursue a sour vision of life, while Vayreda is tilted towards Christian balance, Serrahima, Boada 1996, pp. 140-141, also Fumanal i Pagès 2005, p. 94 \\"novela objectiva\\"Maurici Serrahima, Marià Vayreda, [in:] Dotze mestres, Barcelona 1972, or \\"novela historica\\",opinion of Joaquim Ruyra referred after M.

Notes sobre unes relacions complexes, [in:] Le discours sur la nation en Catalogne aux XIXe et XXe siècles. Hommage à Antoni M. Badia i Margarit, Paris 1995, pp. 211-230. For other scholars the discourse is rather between traditional regionalism (Albert) and reactionary violence (l’Ibo), Illas 2004, p. 94. Some students declare La Punyalada a novel written by a Carlist, see Josep Miralles Clement, Aspectos de la cultura política del carlismo en el siglo XX, [in:] Espacio, Tiempo y Forma 17 ( 2005), p. 155 As a writer Vayreda is not clearly associated with any specific literary group. Some of his contemporaries considered him late follower of Walter Scott school;Joaquim Ruyra referred after Julià i Capdevila 1992, p. 138. Contemporary scholars maintain that Vayreda’s writing can be counted among none of the historical novel schools, be it the romantic gloom of Walter Scott, arecheologic verism of Flaubert, neo-romanticism of Sienkiewicz or scientific penchant of Ebers, Serrahima, Boada 1996, p. 128 others noted lack of romantic gloom and underlining at times bestial brutalitye.g. in La Punyalada the protagonists literally bite each other’s throats when fighting put Vayreda next to scandalizing naturalists like Casellas or Victor Catala.Serrahima, Boada 1996, pp. 140-141, also Fumanal i Pagès 2005, p. 94 Hints at modernismDasca Batalla 2004, p. 235 and symbolismwith special reference to Catalan \\"muntanya\\", forests and architecture, Requesens i Pique 1988, p. 84 are not uncommon. However, according to the most popular lineup Vayreda is first and foremost a protagonist of the Catalan literary Renaixença,in line with his writings adhere to the formula \\"Cantem massa i parlem poc\\" of Jaume Collell, Dasca Batalla 2004, p. 235; see also opinions of Illas 2004, p. 95, Fumanal i Pages 2005, p. 94, Requesens i Pique 1988, p. 84, Casacuberta 2003, p. 49, Tayadella 2013, pp. 277-294, Serahima, Boada 1996, pp. 125-143; this opinion was shared also during early Francoism, see José Munteis Braçons, Notas sobre la literatura de Mariano Vayreda, [in:] ¡Arriba España! 12.12.53 the author who died just when reaching literary maturity.Marian Vayreda. Biografia [in:] Accociació d’escriptors en llengua catalana service; exact cause of his death at the age of 50 is not given by any source consulted Reception and legacy Vayreda ca. 1903 Some sources claim that Vayreda was disappointed by limited success of his paintings; displayed at Catalan and Madrid galleries, they enjoyed polite acknowledgement falling short of universal acclaim, let alone fame.see La Veu de Montserrat, 19.05.83, available here , La Ilustración española y americana 30.06.84, available here, La Ilustración artistica 18.07.98, available here He gained some popularity with stories published in the 1890s, but it was Recorts and Sanch nova which earned him general recognition shortly before death. Vayreda did not live to see success of La Punyalada both among the readers and the critics. Riding the wave of growing Catalanism in first decades of the 20th century the novel was declared its iconic literature, though second edition appeared as late as 1921.D.

See also comparison between the original La Punyalada and the 1990 film, revealing a number of differences. One of them relates to Carlism; the film strongly enhanced the link between the Carlists and the bandits. Carlist threads are associated with scenes of oppression, cruelty and cowardice, e.g. when tormenting the hostage, the bandits make him sing the Carlist anthem Oriamendi. This scene is invented; Vayreda would have not written it not only because of his Carlist leaning, but also because it is entirely anarchronistic (originally Oriamendi was sung only in Basque; the Spanish lyrics allegedly sung by the bandits in the 1840s was in fact written by Ignacio Baleztena in 1908). Also the scene of the former Carlist commander turned bandits’ leader struck by a bullet, falling down the abyss and shouting \\"Visca el Rei\\" is invented and missing in chapter XXI of the book.

The initial discovery comprises 1,550 specimens, representing 737 different elements, and at least 15 different individuals. Despite this exceptionally high number of specimens, their classification with other Homo remains unclear. Along with similarities to contemporary Homo, they share several characteristics with the ancestral Australopithecus and early Homo as well (mosaic anatomy), most notably a small cranial capacity of 465–610 cm3 (28.4–37.2 cu in), compared to 1,270–1,330 cm3 (78–81 cu in) in modern humans. They are estimated to have averaged in height and in weight, yielding a small encephalization quotient of 4.5. Nonetheless, H. naledi brain anatomy seems to have been similar to contemporary Homo, which could indicate equatable cognitive complexity. The persistence of small-brained humans for so long in the midst of bigger-brained contemporaries revises the previous conception that a larger brain would necessarily lead to an evolutionary advantage, and their mosaic anatomy greatly expands the known range of variation for the genus. H. naledi anatomy indicates that, though they were capable of long distance travel with a humanlike stride and gait, they were more arboreal than other Homo, better adapted to climbing and suspensory behaviour in trees than endurance running. Tooth anatomy suggests consumption of gritty foods covered in particulates such as dust or dirt. Though they have not been associated with stone tools or any indication of material culture, they appear to have been dextrous enough to produce and handle tools, and likely manufactured Early or Middle Stone Age industries. It has also been controversially postulated that these individuals were given funerary rites, and were carried into and placed in the chamber. Taxonomy =Discovery= Map of Rising Star Cave marking Dinaledi Chamber in red and Lesedi Chamber in yellow In October 2013, cavers Rick Hunter and Steve Tucker, under the direction of South African palaeoanthropologist Lee Rogers Berger, discovered the Dinaledi Chamber in Rising Star Cave in the Cradle of Humankind, South Africa, containing several hominin fossils. The chamber lies about from the entrance, and the main passage is about long and at its narrowest, and is at the bottom of a vertical drop. In total, more than 1,550 pieces of bone belonging to at least fifteen individuals (9 immature and 6 adults) have been recovered from the clay-rich sediments. Berger and colleagues published the findings in 2015. The fossils represent 737 anatomical elements—including the parts of the skull, jaw, ribs, teeth, limbs, and inner ear bones—from old, adult, young, and infantile individuals. There are also some articulated or near-articulated elements, including the skull with the jaw bone, and nearly complete hands and feet. With the number of individuals of both sexes across several age demographics, it is the richest assemblage of associated fossil hominins discovered in Africa. Aside from the Sima de los Huesos collection and later Neanderthal and modern human samples, the excavation site has the most comprehensive representation of skeletal elements across the lifespan, and from multiple individuals, in the hominin fossil record. The holotype specimen, DH1 The holotype specimen, DH1, comprises a male partial calvaria (top of the skull), partial maxilla, and nearly complete jawbone. The paratypes, DH2 through 5, all comprise partial calvaria. Berger and colleagues named the species Homo naledi, the species name meaning \\"star\\" in the Sotho language, because the remains came from Rising Star Cave. The remains of at least three additional individuals—two adults and a child—were reported in the Lesedi Chamber of the cave by John Hawks and colleagues in 2017. =Classification= In 2017, the Dinaledi remains were dated to 335,000–236,000 years ago in the Middle Pleistocene, using electron spin resonance (ESR) and uranium–thorium (U-Th) dating on 3 teeth, and U-Th and paleomagnetic dating of the sediments they were deposited in. The fossils were previously thought to have dated to 1 to 2 million years ago because no similarly small-brained hominins had previously been known from such a recent date in Africa (the smaller-brained Homo floresiensis of Indonesia lived on an isolated island and apparently went extinct shortly after the arrival of modern humans.) The ability of such a small-brained hominin to have survived for so long in the midst of bigger-brained Homo greatly revises previous conceptions of human evolution and the notion that a larger brain would necessarily lead to an evolutionary advantage. Their mosaic anatomy also greatly expands the range of variation for the genus. H. naledi is hypothesised to have branched off very early from contemporaneous Homo. It is unclear whether they branched off at around the time of H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, and A. sediba; are a sister taxon to H. erectus and the contemporaneous large-brained Homo; or are a sister taxon to the descendants of H. antecessor (modern humans and Neanderthals). This would mean that they branched off from contemporary Homo at latest before 900,000 years ago, and possibly as early as the Pliocene. It is also possible their ancestors speciated after an interbreeding event between Homo and late australopithecines. Looking at the skull, H. naledi has the closest affinities to H. erectus. It is unclear if these H. naledi were an isolated population in the Cradle of Humankind, or if they ranged across Africa. If the latter, then several gracile hominin fossils across Africa which have traditionally been classified as late H. erectus could potentially represent H. naledi specimens. Comparison of skull features of H. naledi with other small-brained Homo (H. habilis, H. e. georgicus, and H. floresiensis) Anatomy =Skull= Different views of LES1 Two male H. naledi skulls from the Dinaledi chamber had cranial volumes of about , and two female skulls . A male H. naledi skull from the Lesedi chamber had a cranial volume of . The Dinaledi specimens are more similar to the cranial capacity of australopithecines; for comparison, H. erectus averaged about , and modern humans for males and females respectively. However, the Lesedi specimen is within the range of H. habilis and H. e. georgicus. The encephalization quotient of H. naledi was estimated at 4.5, which is the same as the pygmy H. floresiensis, but notably smaller than all other Homo (contemporary Homo were all above 6). Nonetheless, the skull shape is more similar to Homo, with a slenderer shape, the presence of temporal and occipital lobes of the brain, and reduced post-orbital constriction (the skull does not become narrower behind the eye-sockets). The frontal lobe morphology is more or less the same in all Homo brains despite size, which differs from Australopithecus, and has been implicated in the production of tools, the development of language, and sociality. It is unclear if H. naledi inherited small brain size from the last common Homo ancestor, or, if it was evolved secondarily more recently. Like modern humans, but unlike fossil hominins (including South African australopithecines, H. erectus, and Neanderthals), the permanent 2nd molar erupted comparatively late in life, emerging alongside the premolars instead of before, which indicates a slower maturation unusually comparable to modern humans. The tooth formation rate of the front teeth is also most similar to modern humans. The overall size and shape of the molars most closely resemble those of three unidentified Homo specimens from the local Swartkrans and East African Koobi Fora Caves, and are similar in size (but not shape) to Pleistocene H. sapiens. The necks of the molars are proportionally similar to those of A. afarensis and Paranthropus. Unlike modern humans and contemporary Homo, H. naledi lacks several accessory dental features, and has a high frequency of individuals who present main cusps, namely the metacone (midline on the tongue-side) and hypocone (to the right on the lip-side) on the 2nd and 3rd molars, and a Y-shaped hypoconulid (a ridge on the lip-side towards the cheek) on all 3 molars. Nonetheless, H. naledi also has many dental similarities with contemporary Homo. The anvil (a middle ear bone) more resembles those of chimps, gorillas, and Paranthropus than Homo. Like H. habilis and H. erectus, H. naledi has a well-developed brow- ridge with a fissure stretching across just above the ridge, and like H. erectus a pronounced occipital bun. H. naledi has some facial similarities with H. rudolfensis. =Build= Skeletal reconstruction of the juvenile DH7 – Scale The H. naledi specimens are estimated to have, on average, stood around and weighed . This body mass is intermediate between what is typically seen in Australopithecus and Homo species. Like other Homo, male and female H. naledi were likely about the same size, males on average about 20% larger than females. A juvenile specimen, DH7, is skeletally consistent with a growth rate similar to the faster ape-like trajectories of MH1 (A. sediba) and Turkana boy (H. ergaster). However, because dental development is so similar to that of modern humans, a slower maturation rate is not completely out of the question. Using the faster growth rate, DH7 would have died at 8–11 years old, but using the slower growth, DH7 would have died at 11–15 years old. Concerning the spine, only the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebrae (in the chest region) are preserved from presumably a single individual, which are proportionally similar to those of contemporary Homo, though are the smallest recorded of any hominin. The two transverse processes of the vertebra, which jut out diagonally, are most similar to those of Neanderthals. The neural canals within are proportionally large, similar to modern humans, Neanderthals, and H. e. georgicus. The 11th rib is straight like that of A. afarensis, and the 12th rib is robust in cross-section like that of Neanderthals. Like Neanderthals, the 12th rib appears to have supported strong intercostal muscles above, and a strong quadratus lumborum muscle below. However, unlike Neanderthals, there was weak attachment to the diaphragm. Overall, this H. naledi specimen appears to have been small-bodied compared to other Homo, though it is unclear if this single specimen is representative of the species. The shoulders are more similar to those of australopithecines, with the shoulder blade situated higher on the back and farther from the midline, short clavicles, and little or no humeral torsion. Elevated shoulder and clavicle bones indicate a narrow chest. The pelvis and legs have features reminiscent of Australopithecus, including anterposteriorly compressed (from front to back) femoral necks, mediolaterally compressed (from left to right) tibiae, and a somewhat circular fibular neck; which indicate a wide abdomen. This combination would preclude efficient endurance running in H. naledi, unlike H. erectus and descendants. Instead, H. naledi appears to have been more arboreal. =Limbs= The metacarpal bone of the thumb was well-developed, which is used in holding and manipulating large objects, and had strong crests to support its opponens pollicis muscle used in precision-pinch gripping, and its thenar muscles. This is more similar to other Homo than Australopithecus. H. naledi appears to have had strong flexor pollicis longus muscles like modern humans, with humanlike palm and finger pads, which are important in forceful gripping between the thumb and fingers. However, unlike Homo, the H. naledi thumb metacarpal joint is comparably small relative to the thumb's length, and the thumb phalangeal joint is flattened. The distal thumb phalanx bone is robust, and proportionally more similar to those of H. habilis and P. robustus. The metacarpals of the other fingers share adaptations with modern humans and Neanderthals to cup and manipulate objects, and the wrist joint is overall comparable to that of modern humans and Neanderthals. Conversely, the proximal phalanges are curved and are almost identical to those of A. afarensis and H. habilis, which is interpreted as an adaptation for climbing and suspensory behaviour. Such curvature is more pronounced in adults than juveniles, suggesting that adults climbed just as much or more so than juveniles, and this behaviour was commonly done. The fingers are also proportionally longer than those of any other fossil hominin (other than the arboreal Ardipithecus ramidus and a modern human specimen from Qafzeh cave, Israel) which is also consistent with climbing behaviour. H. naledi was a biped and stood upright. Like other Homo, they had strong insertion for the gluteus muscles, well-defined linea aspera (a ridge running down the back of the femur), thick patellae, long tibiae, and gracile fibulae. These indicate that they were capable of long distance travel. The H. naledi foot was similar to that of modern humans and other Homo, with adaptations for bipedalism and a humanlike gait. However, the heel bone has a low orientation, comparable to those of non-human great apes, and the ankle bone has a low declination, which possibly indicate the foot would have been subtly stiffer during the stance phase of walking before the foot pushed off the ground. Pathology The adult right mandible U.W. 101-1142 has a bony lesion, suggestive of a benign tumour. The individual would have experienced some swelling and localised discomfort, but the tumour's position near the medial pterygoid muscle may have impeded function of the muscle, and changed elevation of the right side of the jaw, and caused discomfort on the right temperomandibular joint (connecting the jaw with the skull). Dental defects in H. naledi specimens during 1.6–2.8 and 4.3–7.6 months of development were most likely caused by seasonal stressors. This may have been due to extreme summer and winter temperatures causing food scarcity. Also, minimum winter temperatures of the area average about , and can drop below freezing; staying warm for an infant of the small-bodied H. naledi would have been difficult, and winters likely increased susceptibility to respiratory diseases. Environmental stressors is consistent with present-day flu seasons in South Africa peaking during winter, and paediatric diarrhoea hospitalisation being most frequent at the height of the rainy season in summer. Local hominins were likely preyed upon by large carnivores, such as lions, leopards, and hyaenas. However, there seems to be a distinct paucity of large carnivore remains from the northern end of the Cradle of Humankind, where Rising Star Cave is located, possibly because carnivores preferred the Blaaubank River to the south which may have offered better hunting grounds with a greater abundance of large prey items. Alternatively, because many more sites are known in the south than the north, carnivore spatial patterns may not be well-represented by the fossil record. Culture =Food= Dental chipping and wearing indicates the habitual consumption of small hard objects, such as dirt and dust, and cup-shaped wearing on the back teeth may have stemmed from gritty food. Such particulates could have originated from unwashed roots and tubers. Alternatively, aridity could have stirred up particulates onto food items, coating food in dust. It is possible that they commonly ate larger hard items, such as seeds and nuts, but these were processed into smaller pieces before consumption. Whatever the case, H. naledi occupied a seemingly unique niche from previous South African hominins, including Australopithecus and Paranthropus. However, the teeth of all 3 species indicate that they needed to exert high shearing force to chew through perhaps plant or muscle fibres. The teeth of other Homo cannot produce such high forces perhaps due to the use of some food processing techniques, such as cooking. =Technology= Though H. naledi remains are not associated with any stone tools, it is likely they produced Early Stone Age (Acheulean and possibly the earlier Oldawan) or Middle Stone Age industries because they have the same adaptations to the hand as other human species which are implicated in tool production. H. naledi is the only identified human species to have existed during the early Middle Stone Age of the Highveld region, South Africa, possibly indicating that this species manufactured and maintained this tradition at least during this time period. Such industries and stone cutting techniques likely evolved independently several times among different Homo species and populations, or were transported over long distances by the inventors or apprentices and taught. =Funerals= Illustration of Dinaledi Chamber, Rising Star Cave In 2015, archaeologist Paul Dirks, Berger, and colleagues concluded that the bodies had to have been deliberately carried and placed into the chamber by people because they appear to have been intact when they were first deposited in the chamber (no evidence of trauma by being dropped into the chamber nor of predation, and exceptional preservation), the chamber is inaccessible to large predators, the chamber appears to be an isolated system and has never been flooded (that is, natural forces were not at play), there is no hidden shaft by which people could have accidentally fallen in through, and there is no evidence of some catastrophe which killed all the individuals inside the chamber. They said it is also possible that the bodies were dropped down a chute and fell slowly due to irregularity and narrowness of the path down, or a soft mud cushion to land on. In both scenarios, the morticians would have required artificial light to navigate the cave; and the site was used repeatedly for burials as the bodies were not all deposited at the same time. In 2016, palaeoanthropologist Aurore Val countered that such preservation may have been due to mummification rather than careful burial, and the absence of long bone heads is reminiscent of predation, and she believes that discounting natural forces such as flooding for depositing the bodies is unjustified. Further, there is evidence of damage done by beetles, beetle larvae, and snails (which facilitate decomposition); but, the chamber does not present ideal conditions for snails, nor does it contain snail shells, which would indicate decomposition actually initiated before deposition in the chamber. Nonetheless, in 2017, Dirks, Berger, and colleagues reaffirmed that there is no evidence of water flow into the cave, and that it is more likely that these H. naledi were buried in the chamber. They also said it is possible that they were buried by contemporary Homo, such as the ancestors of modern humans, rather than other H. naledi, but, nonetheless, that the cultural behaviour of funerary practises is not impossible for H. naledi, and burial in the chamber may have been done to remove decaying bodies from a settlement, prevent scavengers, or due to social bonding and grief. In 2018, anthropologist Charles Egeland and colleagues echoed Val's sentiments, and stated that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that human species had developed a concept of the afterlife so early in time. They also said that the preservation of the Dinaledi individuals is similar to those of baboon carcasses which accumulate in caves (either by natural death of cave-dwelling baboons or by a leopard dragging in carcasses).

He is the son of Chen Chu, the first PRC ambassador to Japan. He joined the PLA in February 1969, and the Communist Party of China in January 1970.

Chen belonged to the PLA category of \\"cadre to be rescued\\" (), a commander with a distinctive service record who, due to lack of a compulsory experience or lack of a vacancy, is transferred elsewhere as a way of promotion. Without experience as a commanding officer at or above divisional level (), he was unable to become deputy chief of the PLA General Staff Department. He was thus transferred to the PLAAF in 2009 as deputy commander even though the PLAAF had already filled its four deputy- commander quota. As the fifth deputy commander of the PLAAF, he was in charge of intelligence, training safety, and foreign affairs.

Rex as he was affectionately known ,studied B Uris at the University of Bophuthatswana now known as North-West University, The University is based in Mahikeng where Rex lived with his family for some time. Music career To the south west of Johannesburg, Ikageng in Potchefstroom produced a hot soul band called the Teenage Lovers.It is hot property was Rex Rabanye, the keyboard wizard who was Ikageng's response to Alexandra's Sankie Chounyane.He had learned to play the keyboards from his father, Samuel Rabanye at the age of fifteen. His bee-hive organ sound earned him millions of fans around the country. After going solo, Rex Rabanye hit the country with dynamites like O Nketsang and Moya Moya. Some of the multi-talented Rex's painting can be seen on the walls of the African Methodist Church in Ikageng. By the late 80s the lawman who hold a B.Uris degree had moved from his place of birth to Mmabatho near Mafikeng, from where he relaunched his musical career.

The Teenage Lovers band made platinum hits like \\"Botany 500\\", \\"Trinity\\", \\"Mmabatho\\", \\"Potchefstroom Road\\" among others. When the Teenage Lovers disbanded Rex went solo, he conceived platinum-selling albums like Onketsang (1986) and Moya moya (1987).

Born on Tyneside, Brown obtained a scholarship to attend the Sunderland Teacher Training College. Initially highly religious, she changed her views as a result of World War I, and through attending National Council of Labour Colleges lectures led by T. A. Jackson. She became active in the National Union of Teachers and joined the Labour Party in 1918.Graham Stevenson, \\"Brown Isabel\\", Compendium of Communist Biography In 1921, Isabel married Ernest Brown, a local communist, and she became a founder member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), one of only five women delegates to attend its founding congress. She lost her teaching post the following year, when she became pregnant, and moved with Ernest to Moscow in 1924, returning just before the UK general strike. During the strike, Brown was jailed for sedition, and was again imprisoned soon after her release, while she was speaking in support of miners who were still striking. In the late 1920s, Brown organised women's sections of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement. Ernest became the CPGB's Scottish organiser, and she moved with him, becoming women's editor of The Mineworker.Neil C. Rafeek, Communist Women in Scotland, p.35 She stood unsuccessfully in Motherwell at the 1929 general election, and then in the Kilmarnock by-election, later in the year. In 1930, Brown studied at the Lenin School, then led the British Committee for the Relief of Victims of Fascism and was prominent in the Aid for Spain committee. She was particularly well known for her speeches, which were moving and held audiences' attention, and for her ability to answer questions from the public. Brown became extremely active in the British Aid for Spain movement, playing a central role in the cross-party National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief. This included helping out with efforts to house the Basque refugees which came to Britain in 1937. Late in 1930s, Brown became the national women's organiser for the CPGB, and she stood in the 1940 Bow and Bromley by-election, taking only 4.2% of the vote even though she faced only one opponent. Injured in an air raid later in the year, she never fully recovered, standing down as women's officer in 1942, and from the Central Committee in 1947.Labour History Review, vols.68-69, p.118 She stood in her final election at Kilmarnock at the 1950 general election, again failing to come near winning the seat.

It is Grade II* listed. The Hall was built to an H-plan of rendered brick with a Swithland slate hipped roof. It has a seven window frontage with two storeys of sash windows and a row of dormer windows in the roof behind a parapet. At each corner are turret buttresses. History The Wistow estate was bought by the Halford family in 1603. The Hall was built for Richard Halford, who was High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1621 and a prominent Royalist during the Civil War. He was made a baronet by King Charles I in 1641 after having been imprisoned (and then released) by the Parliamentarians. King Charles slept at Wistow the night before the Battle of Naseby and returned to the house after his defeat to change horses, leaving his elaborate saddle behind. Wistow Hall, 1818 The estate descended in the Halford family to the 7th Baronet, Sir Charles Halford, who died in 1780. His widow continued to live at the house until her own death in 1814, during which time the Grand Union Canal was built through the estate. The property then passed to Sir Henry Halford, 1st Baronet the king's physician who had been made a Baronet in his own right and was later to be the President of the Royal College of Physicians for many years. Born Henry Vaughan, he had changed his name to Halford in 1809 when made Baronet in anticipation of the inheritance. Sir Henry made several improvements to the park, rerouting a road and creating a lake. It subsequently passed to his son, Sir Henry Halford, 2nd Baronet, the MP for Leicestershire South and the latter's son, Sir Henry St. John Halford, 3rd Baronet and Chairman of Leicestershire County Council The last Sir Henry was very interested in the development of the rifle and had a shooting range installed at the park, where working with William Ellis Metford he made some significant developments in rifling and bullet design. On his death he left the Hall to his friend and rifle development collaborator, Thomas Fremantle, 3rd Baron Cottesloe. During the First World War the Hall was used as a hospital. The hall passed to John Fremantle, 4th Baron Cottesloe and during the Second World War was used as a refuge for Lutheran priests, one of whom stayed on after the war and ran, together with the 4th Baron's wife Lisbet, the International Christian Centre for Friendship and Service until 1958. It was then given to Lord Fremantle's daughter, Ann, who had married Timothy Brooks, and the couple renovated and modernised the house, converting part of it into apartments. Timothy Brooks served as High Sheriff of the county in 1979, Lord Lieutenant from 1989 to 2003 and was subsequently knighted. Sir Timothy's son Richard was also High Sheriff in 2012.

Background Tucker is a former critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer. He interviewed most of the film's cast and crew, except Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. He observed that they were unaware of the reasons for the popularity and influence of the film. Tucker researched for two years; he read the 1930 novel Scarface by Armitage Trail and watched both the 1932 and 1983 films numerous times. He also bought a lot of Scarface-related products, such as flip-flops, shower curtains, dartboards, and poker chips. The Scarface pajamas that he bought \\"kind of freaked out [his] wife\\". Content The book is divided into seven main chapters: Major Immigrant Smuggling Ring, The Director, Scarface Music, Howard Hawk's Scarface, Armitage Trail's Scarface, Movies TV Shows Novels, and A Meaning of Scarface. An appendix titled \\"Scarface as a business plan (or the 8 Habits of Highly Successful but Tragic Gangsters)\\" was also included in the book. Martin Scorsese told Steven Bauer that \\"Hollywood is going to hate this film, because it's about them\\". Tucker notes that the film was created by White males, yet it has influenced Black and Hispanic youth the most. By the suggestion of Sidney Lumet, the origin of the main character Tony Montana was changed from an Italian to a Cuban. In his work, Tucker calls Scarface an \\"ultimate gangster film\\" and \\"a great shallow masterpiece\\". Reception Louis Bayard wrote for Salon that Tucker had set a difficult mission for himself, writing about a film that was \\"not good at all\\". S. James Snyder wrote for Time magazine that \\"Tucker bolsters his argument that whatever your opinion on the film, Scarface cannot be dismissed.\\" References External links * Scarface Nation at Amazon.com Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books about individual films Category:Scarface (1983 film) Category:American non- fiction books Category:St. Martin's Press books ","title":"Scarface Nation"},{"id":"47775063","text":"The Demands of the Slovak Nation () was a manifesto issued by Slovak nationalists during the revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. It was prompted by the nationalists' realisation that the Hungarian government would not heed the calls of Ľudovít Štúr for the establishment of public regional assemblies and the acceptance of a Slovak petition at a national assembly. On 10 May 1848, thirty members of Stúr's circle of nationalist activists met in Liptószentmiklós (now Liptovský Mikuláš), at the initiative of Štefan Marko Daxner and Ján Francisci. They drew up a list of fourteen demands which included: * Equality and fraternal coexistence of all peoples in Hungary; * Transformation of Hungary into a decentralised state consisting of equal nations, each with its own parliament and equal representation in the Diet of Hungary; * Adoption of the Slovak language as an official language in government offices and schools in the Slovak lands; * Official recognition of Slovak symbols (colours and a national flag); * Establishment of a Slovak national guard; * Introduction of full voting rights for adult males; * Abolition of laws limiting the freedoms of the press, of assembly and of association; * Reformation of land ownership by restoring the land that had been seized from the peasants by the Hungarian aristocracy. The nationalists rejected the way that Hungary was run as a centralised state under ethnic Hungarian supremacy and sought to establish Slovak autonomy within a reformed state. Some of their demands, such as their call for universal manhood suffrage, were unusually radical for their era and location. The demands were the first public call to make the area then known as Upper Hungary (most of which is now modern Slovakia) a distinct political entity. They were proclaimed on 11 May but were poorly received. The assembly at which they were issued was ill-attended and before they could be delivered to Ferdinand I, the King of Hungary and Emperor of Austria, the Hungarian government declared that the demands were an illegal, unconstitutional and pan-Slavic act. Štúr and his associates Jozef Miloslav Hurban and Michal Miloslav Hodža were targeted with arrest warrants issued the day after the proclamation was issued. Several of those involved with the proclamation were imprisoned and the government declared martial law in Upper Hungary. Štúr, Hurban and Hodža subsequently adopted a more radical approach; a few months later they established the Slovak National Council and launched an ultimately unsuccessful armed rebellion against the Hungarian government.Kirschbaum, pp. 294–5 References Category:Political history of Slovakia Category:Slovak independence movement Category:1848 documents Category:1848 in Hungary ","title":"Demands of the Slovak Nation"},{"id":"47775107","title":"Candidates of the 1924 South Australian state election"},{"id":"47775122","text":"Budhi Pind or Budi Pind is a very small village in Nakodar.

Built in 1857 in the city's then-fashionable Thomas Hill neighborhood, it is one of northern Maine's finest examples of Italianate architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Low House is located on the north side of Thomas Hill Road, immediately south of the Thomas Hill Standpipe on Thomas Hill, a rise overlooking Kenduskeag Stream and downtown Bangor. It is a two-story wood frame structure, its main block roughly square, with a hip roof topped by an octagonal cupola. The front of the house is finished in wooden clapboards, while the side walls are finished in flushboarding configured to resemble stonework. The front (south-facing) facade is symmetrically arranged, three bays across, with a center entrance sheltered by a multi-columned porch. The window above the entrance is a double window, while the windows flanking the entrance have segmented-arch tops, and have bracketed hoods above. The second- floor windows have elaborate Italianate surrounds, and there are paired brackets in the roof eave. A porch extends along part of the left side. The house was designed by Harvey Graves and built in 1857 for Joseph Low, a wealthy man of unknown business who moved to California after the American Civil War. The Thomas Hill area was at that time promoted as a new fashionable neighborhood, due in part to the views it furnished, as the previously- fashionable area, Broadway, had become built out.
